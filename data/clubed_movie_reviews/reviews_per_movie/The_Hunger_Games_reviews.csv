Silent Thrills,"The Hunger Games is ought to be the next big thing like Harry Potter, except it already started in a darker and more serious tone than any other young adult fantasy book films. The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins' book to life. It's not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It's a film with moving drama and has its suspense.It's pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn't get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.The movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn't have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn't focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn't really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren't lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It's nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.The Hunger Games is thrilling and solid enough. Decent filmmaking made it spectacular. It's amazing and intriguing enough to start a big series. It succeeds to become a solid and one and not a lackluster like Twilight or I Am Number Four. I don't know what else to say about it, but it's silent, gritty, and compelling.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not quite the Battle Royale,"Thrilling,Engaging and entertaining dystopian action sci-fiction flick. Really liked the visuals and all the action scenes. This is the real deal of Drama and action. Screenplay,costumes and make up all are decent. Especially the make up and movie sets are very beautiful and elegant which make the people from novel come to life. Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don't know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. other than that it is good popcorn entertainer. Loved Jennifer Lawrence though. Acting is far far better than that Kristen-NO-Expression-Stewart. Not only Jennifer but all the actors did their job very good. Now looking forward to sequels.Hope they will be better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Well, it's no Battle Royale...","There's almost nothing to say about a movie like The Hunger Games -- it's been so worked to death to be a successful blockbuster that all of its edges, the things that make a film good or bad, have disappeared. It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.I could go on about the particulars of the adaptation -- the ridiculousness of the entire Capital setting, or the sometimes disorienting shakycam work, or the great cast of adults patiently playing supporting characters -- or the source material -- the gestures at social commentary, the way that the story protects Katniss from ever having to morally sully herself -- but they all seem to be beside the point. Look. The movie has the things that happened in the book, but in a movie, competently shot and acted, with absolutely no risks taken. If you liked the book, or want to learn what this whole Hunger Games thing is about without having to read the book, you'll probably like this. It's a digestible film, even an enjoyable one, but in the end it's not really interesting or memorable. But to be fair, it wasn't meant to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Nice adaption from the book, but...","One of the things I liked the most about reading 'The Hunger Games' was the intensity of how it was written. Feeling the story seemed maybe even more important than reading it, so when I went to see the movie, my expectations were very high.On the upside: Great performance by the main characters, excellent visuals and well directed.On the downside: The book gives a lot of context as to how the characters feel and how things have come to be the way they are. The movie changes a number of things to make it at all possible to show the story and for me the choices made took down the quality of the story a bit. To give at least some context, it took the movie a while to get really started and even despite that, some of the characters, again in my opinion, didn't really develop in depth the way they should.Long story short, I liked the movie and thought it was a nice adaptation from the book, but it lacked a bit the intensity from the book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perspective from a VERY senior citizen,"This is not so much a review, everything has already been said in the other postings, but rather my experience with this movie and book.OK, look, I'm probably old enough to be the grandfather of most of the people submitting reviews to this movie. I am not into the teen age drivel that seems to be everywhere you look these days but .....I first heard about the story when the book came out. It seemed you couldn't turn around without hearing it being discussed everywhere. The enormous hype made me mildly curious, but not so curious that I wanted to read the book. Fast forward several years: the book had been out, the movie hade been out, the DVD had been out and only then did I accidentally stumble across the DVD at the library. I could check it out for free and if I didn't like it I could turn it off after ten minutes ... so, why not?I immediately found myself captivated by the beautiful cinematography and background theme and despite the over-the-top and ridiculous costumes and makeup of the people in The Capitol I decided to continue watching. I was drawn deeper and deeper into the story and the characters and after about a fourth of the way through I knew I was hooked. The acting, starting with Jennifer Lawrence, was exceptionally good. I have to go through about 25 movies before I find one that I can say I absolutely loved ... this was a 25er.To finish my story: unbelievably, when I returned the DVD to the library, on a table in the lobby of the library where they sold used books cheaply, I found a mint condition copy of the book (the big paperback format) for fifty cents. I grabbed it. I began reading the book when I got home and couldn't put it down even though I already knew the story. Collins' writing style was as captivating as her story and the very few differences between the movie and the book were not worth mentioning. Actually, I thought the movie version of the ending was better (just couldn't imagine Rue as a werewolf).I now own, and have seen and read, all of the books and movies of the franchise and consider them among some of the best entertainment of my life. SO it seems the old adage is wrong because you really CAN teach an old dog new tricks. Other young adult movies came out after 'The Hunger Games' which tried to capitalize on the same type of theme and they, by comparison, have failed miserably in my estimation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Predictable but Dark. Starts Terrifically.,"An unfortunate catalyst that propelled the trend of teenage protagonist led book adaptations, of dystopian futures. Divergent and Maze Runner followed, both failing to complete their respective stories. Perhaps that has tainted the memory of a satisfactory film, undefinable by genre.It's easy to forget that way back in 2012 this was fresh and new, tonally dark cinema, aiming for the teenage demographic. Perhaps that's a large reason for the success of the franchise, it was new and interesting, everything since has just been a rehash, located in a different world.Refreshingly dark and mature, visually graphic, The Hunger Games has a lot going for it, as a visual spectacle, not so much as an immersive and compelling story. Narratively it meanders, without intent, there's a station to arrive at but not the train track to get there. Tonally gloomy at times, balance is hard to find. Switches in mood make the texture of the atmosphere uneven, because changes are jarring and misplaced. The edit failed to maximise the potential seeping throughout. Scenes are drawn out and end on odd notes, something that could've been tightened up in post-production. Additionally more cuts to and through between the Games and the world at present would've helped to increase tension while the story pondered, the scale and public reaction isn't documented anywhere near enough, if at all. Personally I feel the editing really trips this film up, it's quite easily 10-15 minutes too long, feeling even longer due to the fact of how much sitting around there is.Stretched so far it's see through, the ending is blatant from the get go, meaning there's not much to keep you interested after the half hour mark.Gary Ross shows wonderful craft and delicacy when concerning the dark themes of oppressed society, life without choice and just how bleak living in a dictatorship is. In the first act he manages to craft a tone and atmosphere that reeks of desperation, fear, the empty void of hopelessness and life without control. Yet he lifts the mood with the slightest and smallest of scenes between Kat and Gale, serving as a reminder of humanity's ability to dream and aspire for a better world. Each shot set in District 12 is delightful, sombre chills run through every vein as you are enraptured in fear and anxiety. The build up to and throughout the reaping is tense and nauseating, interactions with Kat and her sister are filmed so preciously. Sound is well utilised through the overdrawn run-time, music is allowed to overrun and dominate, drowning out the world perfectly and symbolically. An example that comes to mind concerning the sound is when Kat offers herself up, her screaming juxtaposed against the silence sets her out from the rest, nailing her on as the protagonist we will all route for. Selfless.This was Jennifer Lawrence's big break in the public eye, she left a good impression. Portrayed with care, Katniss is delicately played when is necessary but can easily surge with passion when needed. Reminiscent of an indie film portrayal, Jennifer showcases her range and hits all the marks, and you, in all the right places.Hunger Games starts off brilliantly, it's exhilarating and tense, filled with subtlety. Has a terrific lead performance that powers you through. It's weighed down by an underwhelming narrative, that's evened out with an enjoyable character arc. Sadly it gets wrapped up in it itself, losing its awareness of how sick a situation this is, and rather than point it out, chooses to accept the societal issues, it so cleverly addressed in the beginning. We then drift and chunder toward the inevitable ending.Nevertheless I'd quite happily re-watch the first act, but would have no qualms with skipping the rest.It's a solid piece of film-making.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Two Words: Battle Royale,"Seeing the ""Hunger Games"" series gain so much recognition is difficult to fathom; especially when it's more or less a blatant copy of ""Battle Royale"", a Japanese novel (1996), movie (2000), and manga (2000-2005). I've read the entire series of ""Hunger Games"" (2008), and not only is the writing style bland, but the plot is exceedingly unoriginal and not 'unique' like many of you are claiming it to be. Like the ""Battle Royale"" manga, ""Hunger Games"" includes love triangles, a group of teenagers randomly chosen (BR: by class HG: by district), plans to overthrow authority, teens given weapons and forced into a death match, a pair working together to undermine the game with the help of an older mentor who had previously won the game, both female and male main leads, a corrupted government, signal fires and bird calls, a reality TV show program (which IS in the English adaption of the manga (2006) for the series unlike many of you have known), and the list goes on and on. Evidence of these unconcealed similarities can be found on various Internet articles (whose writers I sincerely thank). I urge you to go right now and read the manga or novel of Battle Royale online so that you can compare the two series. The author of ""Hunger Games"" blatantly claimed (*cough* lied *cough) that she supposedly never even knew of ""Battle Royale"", so you can't use 'inspiration' as an excuse anymore. Instead, she blurted out nonsense about Roman mythology and the Iraq war since she doesn't want to admit her source of inspiration is a contemporary. How convenient for her own success since ""Battle Royale"" is a Japanese series that isn't well known in North America. She basically made an American-version of the series that contains less gruesome content and involves districts in place of school classes. Even if she truly did not know about ""Battle Royale"" or mysteriously forgot about it in the back of her mind, it is still part of an author's job to confirm the originality of his or her own to-be published works through researching. I'm posting this all of over the web so that ""Battle Royale"" can at least receive some acknowledgment that the ""Hunger Games"" author denied. Sure enough, both series also share resemblances with ""The Lord of the Flies"" and ""The Running Man"". However, unlike the HR author, the BR author has not denied this inspiration. Moreover, the ""Hunger Games"" is more like a rip-off of ""Battle Royale"" than an inspiration since the majority of the plot elements are nearly identical. There's a fine line between the words 'inspiration' and 'copy', and ""Hunger Games"" has extended far past it. There are also many popular American series that were inspired by Japanese series such as ""The Matrix"" from ""Ghost in the Shell"", however they rightfully gave credit for the 'original' series unlike a certain someone. I sincerely apologize if I seem rash with my word choice, but it's so aggravating that Suzanne Collins had dare stated that she wasn't inspired by ""Battle Royale"" when she clearly was. What's more contemptible is that she's getting not only famous from her rip-off, but she's also obtaining vast amounts of money from it. But hey, that's how reality works, right? Therefore, I don't care if this is marked as spam or hauled with negative comments from ""Hunger Game"" fanatics. As long as it reveals to some people the credit ""Battle Royale"" genuinely deserves, then I'm satisfied. Nonetheless, the movie's portrayal of ""Hunger Games"" is quite exceptional in comparison to other movies adapted from books, which is why I am rating this 2/10 instead of 1/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A true game-changer for movies aimed at teens.,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the ""The Hunger Games"" book series by Suzanne Collins. I've read them countless times and when I found out they were making a movie of them a little over a year ago I was very excited. But I was also worried.""The Hunger Games"" is not very easy source material. The book is written in first person narrative with very detailed descriptions of everything form the characters' looks to the strange futuristic devices they use in Panem, the future version of the U.S. where the story takes place. I couldn't imagine that they would be able to convey every detail as I had imagined it and make the story believable without an R-rating or a huge budget. All of my concerns were wiped away when I saw the movie.I've never seen a more faithful adaption of a book in my life. All of the costumes, the sets, the locations, the cast (I'll talk more about them in a while) and the pacing is as if they were exactly replicated from the book. And the small things that do differ or are added (such as more insight to the gamemakers' control room) only add to the amazing world Collins created and improve the narrative movie-wise. And the movie is great for people who haven't read the books as well. Not once did I feel as if something was vague or badly explained.The cast is stellar. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss carries the movie and makes me regret complaining about her casting because she was too ""hot"" and not starved enough. She IS Katniss and one can feel the graveness of an situation just by looking at one of her expressions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta is also a true breakout performance. The way he looks at Katniss will makes girls all over the world envy her, just like it's supposed to be. Other standouts in the cast include Stanley Tucci as the flamboyant talk-show host Caesar Flickerman, Woody Harrelson as the sarcastic but caring mentor Haymitch and Wes Bentley as the sinister game-maker Seneca Crane (his final scene might be the best one in the whole movie). The child actors Willow Shields and Amandla Stendberg who portrays Prim and Rue are believable and heartbreaking even though they're inexperienced.Despite the PG-13 rating the movie doesn't gloss over or sugarcoat anything for their audience. The violence may not be gloriously graphic but it's still there. People will feel the tributes' pain and despair and not even realize the violence isn't gory until you've left the theater. The movie also deals with important themes like survival, governmental control, grief and helplessness. There is a minor love story subplot, but it doesn't distract from the movies main themes. In my opinion I think it rather improves them by showing some light in the dark.The only complaint I can think of is that the movie feels too short. It's almost two and a half hours long, but it feels as if it goes by in a blink. I will have to see it again to fully pay attention to every detail (such as the costumes and animation of the Capitol, which looked amazing). But this is still not me saying that the movie is rushed, because as I stated the source material is very dense and the filmmakers managed include almost everything.People are expecting this to become the next Twilight-style teen movie franchise. I can't say I think the two stories have anything in common even though I hope ""The Hunger Games"" will do as well at the box office. But if the first movie is any indication of the quality of what's to come - this will be a series way out of Twilight's league.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable but very flawed,"Overall it is great to see the novel brought to life on the big-screen. First of all, kudos to the actors - each does a marvelous job with their roles. Harrelson, Lawrence, Hutchinson, Tucci, Banks and the rest of the cast - they all nail their characters and do them honor.The heart of the story is intact, unfortunately there are many significant elements from the novel entirely missing, or changed to the point they lose the depth of meaning they were intended to have. Unlike some of the sub-plot and story elements left out of the Potter and LOTR series, these missing and adulterated items matter greatly, and lessen the quality of the movie. I will give the producers credit for building Seneca Crane's role in an effective way that answers many questions for those that have not read the books.Finally - production values. You will suffer significant eyestrain after 2.5 hours of glaring close-ups. All of the action is shot so close and is so muddled it is almost impossible to determine what is happening. The chariot display is shown either to close or too far away, and in both cases so fast that the impact of the glorious entrance and introduction of the tributes is lost. The CG shots (thankfully there are few of them) look like leftovers from a Syfy channel production. This may be the worst big-budget production to hit the big screen in years. Although Ross worked well with the actors, he did not handle the action epic elements well at all. The cinematography is atrocious and the whole production looks cheap.You will enjoy the movie, but you will also wish for the grand and respectful care-taking that was given the Potter and Lord of the Rings franchises.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Surprisingly safe and sanitised – lacks the horror, satire and commentary it could and should have had","There was a great deal of hype and fuss when The Hunger Games came out as a film and perhaps I should have known I was not target audience because up till then I had never heard of the book series (or indeed that a film was being made). Although with the usual hoopla that goes with any large film, quite a few critics I respect gave it surprisingly good reviews and I decided I would check it out at some point as it seemed to offer more than just a copy of Battle Royale for American teenagers. With all the fuss (and teenage audience) I was very happy to let it go by in the cinemas and instead I waited for the DVD.The film offers a lot of potential and this potential is evident from the start because it sets out its stall to be many things. Firstly there is plenty of room for satire by virtue of this exaggerated futuristic world where this annual murder is presented as both entertainment and also as a way of punishing the masses and keeping them in their place while those with the power enjoy the best of life. Secondly there is the opportunity to draw the audience into being a viewer of this very thing and then confronting us with the horror of what it really means so that there is at least a part of us questioning what we're finding entertaining. I wasn't looking for this to be some incredibly dark film that spits out an audience full of self-loathing and introspection, but I did expect it to be intelligent and impacting on some level to make it stand out from being just a teen-friendly adventure story.The film itself surprised me by falling far short of what it could have been and squandering or ignoring most of the things of the potential it had. In terms of the satire, it never convinced me of the world it had created – it seemed unnecessarily excessive and didn't have enough truth to it to make me believe. I got the impression that it wasn't particularly interested in making the world function as a real place either – just that it was on screen was enough. As a place for commentary or digs at real things, it wasn't that it picked easy targets or easy shots, it was more a matter of it not really having much interest in saying anything beyond a few very basic things. This is a problem not only because it wasted potential but also because the first hour or so of this film is entirely in this world.The second hour is within the games itself and as such it does have dramatic moments as one would expect (it is after all, an expensive Hollywood thriller), however these are fewer than I would have liked and also a lot less impacting – I watched most of it with a removal that I shouldn't have had. The delivery of children violently murdering other is only horrifying in regards how sanitised and unhorrific it is. I wasn't looking for it to be really gory or to revel in the blood, but it certainly should not have been something that I watch without any reaction. This lack of horror (even just emotional horror) leaves the game as a rather hollow affair which eventually turns into a standard thriller where we root for the ""good"" kids over the ""bad"" kids, even though it would have been stronger to have not drawn that very easy line.The performances are mostly solid even though the majority have little to work with. Lawrence is a good actress and she adds a weight to her character tat doesn't seem to come from anywhere but her. I liked her throughout – even terrible ""fire"" special effects seemed unable to make her look bad. The supporting cast aren't able to bring as much as her to the table – even though there are plenty of big names here. The majority of the other children are carefully cast and given exits from the story that befits the easy-road approach to the plot.I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but I was surprised to find that the words sanitised, safe and standard were the ones that kept going through my mind considering I was watching a globally successful satire that uses the murder of children by other children as its core plot. As it is The Hunger Games comes off as a lot of ideas that have been done better elsewhere and any teeth it may have had are all smoothed down and buffed into a consumer friendly product that will undoubtedly become a smash franchise – my only hope is that the next film can deliver some of its promise and not just churn out something as safe, generic and frankly unmemorable as this one.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"First Harry Potter, then Twilight...now the Hunger Games, America's next Obsession","Wow, what an adrenaline rush! I was so impressed with this film that I created an account just so I could review it. I'm from Hawaii and I managed to catch a early screening of the movie. First off let me start by saying that I have read all three books, and I must admit that the trailer made me a bit hesitant. I mean in the trailer they didn't get the little details right (for instance Katniss's backpack is suppose to be orange and it isn't) but that didn't stop me from seeing the movie, and it SHOULD NOT stop you either! The movie followed the books as closely as a ""PG-13"" rating would allow, and the things they did change didn't distract from the overall movie.I don't want to say too much, but this movie is a magnificent start to what I hope will be an epic trilogy. The actors/actresses are wonderfully cast and their performances are extremely convincing. Not to mention that there is plenty of suspense and action to keep you glued to the screen (even if you've already read the books!)Now I now it's difficult to watch a movie when you've already read the books. People already have preconceived notions about who the actors/actresses should have been, what the setting should look like, or how the plot should unfold. But I promise you, the movie does the book PLENTY of justice.

There can only be one winner of the game,"The hunger game is a game that everyone is not willing to participate in.In this killing game with no humanity, no rules, and no shame, the purpose of the game is just to make people forget to resist and lose their humanity.One of the most important rules of the hunger game is: only one survives.This man returned Yijin to the ""privilege, wealth, reputation, prosperity"" that the poor compatriots in his hometown envied.Every game, everyone will watch.

Battle Royale for the young ones,"I am referring to the audience watching. Because the original Battle Royale (japanese movie) with a similar theme, was more of an adult version of this movie right here. Having said that, the idea is so good it translates to the screen, even if it is watered down a bit. Plus I was just enjoying the girls moaning and exhaling in general while watching this and finding romance even in the weirdest of situations. Throw in Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and the always reliable Stanley Tucci for some acting/weirdness weight and you got yourself a movie.Apparently though the movie has not covered everything the novel had to offer (which should be no surprise). What should be a surprise to anyone who was living outside the US, is the fact, that this was one of the most anticipated movies in recent history (though I'm more than happy that The Avengers beat them at the total box office of course).

Critics missed the most salient failing of this film.,"When I read the first critic reviews that sprang up I didn't see anything out of the ordinary for a book to movie adaptation; Characters were omitted, characters weren't developed as well as the books, plot points were dropped, etc.I knew this going in, and as I said fairly predictable for an adaption. However what most reviews missed, including the esteemed Ebert, was the I hope Zenith of what David Bordwell calls intensified continuity, a narrative trend towards quick cuts, hand-held cameras, and camera movement. A great example would be the third Bourne movie where there were reports of people throwing up in the theaters, with an average shot length of under 3s.The Hunger Games lacks the clarity of the Bourne film in terms of framing though. As I said, expected the story to have trouble with fidelity, but I was always hopeful that at the very least I would be able to SEE a beloved series in live action.Instead, all I can really remember were a few master shots, some blurry trees and Jennifer Laurence's face. They make up 90% of the 2,500 plus shots in the film. All the action, probably for PG-13 rating, is so closely framed and quickly cut that any comprehension of who is actually doing what to who is retarded.I hear Ross is on for Part 2, so I just rented Battle Royale, and hopefully that can salvage my disappointment. I will say I thought the Trailer was really cool, and the few times you do see Panem, the costumes and make up were spot on. No real complaints with the actors either, they did the best with the screen time they had, even if most of their emotions are unjustifiable without having read the book because the film makes no effort to explain or validate whats going on.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Addressing concerns of violence, and Battle Royale.","Addressing the concerns of violence in The Hunger Games movie: The acts of compassion outshine the acts of violence. Also, the message of persevering through something so tragic, and being the spark of hope that eventually surpasses fear, is a great message for kids -- as well as, good verses evil. If you talk to your children about life and how cruel people can be, and to try and be a good role model for compassion, they will understand this movie. As the old cliché goes ""the book is better than the movie."" -- not so in all cases, but in this, it's true. I have to say, they did a good job with this one -- being that it was written in a first person narration, it was pretty close to the novel, and truly captured the essence of the tragic tale. As usual, with every novel that has been adapted into a screenplay, there will be some changes and some things left out in the making of the film. But, overall I was pleased with this movie. Before anyone critiques it, they should see it, as well as read the books. This movie has been criticized for its violent content -- but, kids today are actually exposed to much worse through TV, movies, video games, music, etc...as well as the DAMAGING doses of sex being slipped into every form of entertainment we're exposed to in our society. We should educate our children with the knowledge of how blessed they are to be living in a free nation such as ours -- instead of places like the Sudan, where people are suppressed, terrorized, starved, and slaughtered, everyday. There is a huge difference in trying to keep your child's innocence intact, compared with keeping them naive to the cruelties of mankind. Also, if you've ever read the famous works of The Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, and other greats, you'll know that many stories written have exposed children to such good and evil of this world...providing many with a moral to the story. Movies such as Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc...have their share of battles that contain a measure of violence as well -- as so with The Hunger Games, they too, were forced to fight what was evil. I believe, if at all possible, in taking the negative and turning into a positive. The heroin in this story, was able to do that -- as she's a much better role model than most kids have on TV.Also, there are those who're comparing The Hunger Games to a 1999 Japanese novel, Battle Royale. Both novels are great reads in their own right -- don't knock either one of them until you read them both. The stories are completely different as with the characters. The only similarity is the tragic tale of kids being forced to fight to the death with only one survivor aloud to live -- all for the totalitarian purpose of terrorizing and suppressing the nation's populous with its life threatening methods of control, fear-mongering, and propaganda. In Battle Royale: The kids are all of the same age (9Th grade), they are gassed on a bus during a school field trip, kidnapped, and then taken to an island ""School"" as part of a military research project called the ""Program"".

The Hunger Games leaves you Hungry for more.,"The Hunger Games, live up to every expectation and stays real and on the guidelines of the book series, if you enjoyed the books the film adaptation is a must. The film certainly has the potential to become the new phenomenon in replace of the recently ended Harry Potter series, in many ways it can be compared to the Harry Potter series, but I prefer The Hunger Games, so far.. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson both played parts excellently and I think it is one of best performances for both Jennifer and Josh, the other stars in the film also play well and give a superb finish to the cast. The environment in the film very much is what you can imagine from the books explanation and is great to see so well done.

Emotionally touching journey for an open minded viewer,"First of all, let me say that I'm personally an avid movie and book fanatic. And by that I don't mean just The Hunger Games, but both books and films in overall. With that as my background, I can say I've seen awful a lot of movies and read just as many books. Good and bad. I guess it's also worth mentioning, that I've read all The Hunger Games books as well. Actually, I'm working in a library and therefore can say I've witnessed the sudden ""The Hunger Games"" hype probably from closer than most.It's true that some of the most violent and disturbing parts of the book have taken a friendlier approach in the film. Is that absolutely a bad thing? If putting children to fight each other to death isn't horrible enough without showing bloody killing scenes and battles, there might be something wrong in your own perspective. What happened to you, book readers? Don't you have imagination at all to fill the missing spots or blank spaces?Personally, I liked the book and I liked the movie. I liked the rest of the books as well. Suzanne Collins way of writing is very descriptive. She fills the book with detail, especially about how people act, react and feel.I find it funny when people complain that the actors aren't believable enough in such a situation. How on earth could you know how human being would actually react under such a circumstances? People express emotions differently.Of course the movie wasn't perfect either. It is a faithful adaption from the book, with some flaws here and there. But most importantly it managed to capture the feeling of the book, the emotions, despair and hope, love and hate between the characters. Towards each other and the Capitol.Shooting, setting and music was excellent. Jennifer as Katniss was wonderful, Josh as Peeta was believable and Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley and especially Stanley Tucci were absolutely amazing.This is definitely not a teen movie, nor are the books. I personally feel there was a marketing flaw that prevented The Hunger Games from being an masterpiece it could've been. Either as a book or a film. And that is not because of a friendlier approach on a horrible subject. It's because of the prejudice that ""a teen movie"" or ""a teen book"" can not be intelligent or tackle powerful subjects.In my personal opinion The Hunger Games have a similar feel to one of the best books ever written: George Orwell's 1984. Especially the last book of the series. It's one of those books that leaves you wondering for a long.A tip for all movie goers. If you're going to see movie looking flaws, you're not gonna see anything else at all. Finding flaws from an imperfect creation doesn't make you clever or witty. Go open minded and don't get stuck on details. Look for emotions and let your imagination fill the rest. Trust me, you'll be enjoying movies a lot more often.Despite the differences with the book, I think the film deserves a solid or excellent rating. I gave 10 just to tackle the unfair 1-3 ratings that this movie by no yardstick could deserve.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Battle Royale made by Hollywood,"Before I start, I've not read the 3 books associated with this film.I watched The Hunger Games on the weekend, and it's an OK movie edited for kids. Suzanne Collins denies any knowledge of Battle Royale, but the duplication is embarrassing. As the phrase goes, ""there's nothing new in Hollywood"" and this is evident throughout this film from start to finish.Please watch the original Battle Royale which is 1000% times better than this, watered down, made to make millions Hollywood creation.This film does not deserve the hype surrounding it, but I just hope the millions this film generates is funnelled into some new and exciting not the same crap often expected from Hollywood.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Family-friendly nastiness!,"When a massive movie franchise comes to a close, often a hole can develop in the highly competitive market of Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. Perhaps never before has that hole been as large as the abyss left by the HARRY POTTER series, given the rapid release schedule of those films. It's 2012, and there's no new POTTER. Some might argue that the TWILIGHT series fills the void, yet not only is that franchise little more than a punchline to all but the hardcore fans, it too is set to (hopefully) wrap up this year. Enter THE HUNGER GAMES, seemingly a sure thing based on the POTTER formula: hugely successful series of young adult novels? Check. Talented cast of young leads and respected character actors as support? Naturally. Large scale production and, crucially, marketing budget? You bet. So is THE HUNGER GAMES worthy of taking up the POTTER mantle?Amazingly, it might be even better.While no-one would suggest that THE HUNGER GAMES is the most original new property coming from the Hollywood machine, Lionsgate and director Gary Ross adapt Suzanne Collins' source material in just the right ways, jettisoning un-cinematic elements and focusing on the meat of the story right from the opening frame. Rather than build the world of Panem through tedious exposition and backstory, Ross instead drops us directly into the grim life of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and her journey to the Hunger Games, a perverse spectacle inflicted annually on 24 unfortunate teens. While the POTTER series certainly headed in a darker direction as it went on, THE HUNGER GAMES is horrifically bleak right from the get go, and Ross' decision to show instead of tell, through the use of wonderfully expressive, fluid camera-work, paints an ugly picture indeed. There are so many refreshing elements at work here, with an active, independent, and strong female protagonist and a startling absence of overblown CGI, but it's the nastiness that makes this film unique. Delivering a family appropriate experience while retaining the majority of the violence and unpleasantness of the novel is a delicate proposition which Ross mostly pulls off, but one can't help wondering about the potential for a much harder, R-rated cut of the film. It's an understandable issue to be sure, but an issue nonetheless.Where THE HUNGER GAMES perhaps doesn't fare so well is in the internal strife faced by Katniss, particularly in regards to potential love interests Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Collins' novel has much more freedom to explore, and even dwell on, Katniss' emotional state through inner monologue, but given the nature of film, particularly a mainstream blockbuster such as this, much less room is left for introspection, and some of the character dynamics and relationships suffer in comparison. Katniss' independence is unfortunately undercut by the franchise building mentality of the film, setting up an inevitable love triangle to be explored in two potential sequels. That said, she's still a much more positive, appropriate female role model than TWILIGHT's limp and passive Bella Swan, or indeed any young female character in recent memory. THE HUNGER GAMES is an important film at many levels, one which heralds the birth of the next big Hollywood franchise, and if the quality of the first installment is maintained then the sequels can't come soon enough.tinribs27.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Not sure why so many people hated it, it was a great movie!","I loved it! Having not read the books, and not really knowing what the hell it was about, i dragged my man along and we both thought it was a great movie, me more than him I guess, but he still watched it with me again recently when it came out on DVD.I read all 3 books after I first saw it, and yes there are some plot holes and unexplained things when looking back at the movie, but so what. You cannot possibly put everything from the book in the movie, it would end up being 5 hours long. The only thing that could have been done differently to fill some of the plot holes is made Katniss the narrator, but even after never having read the books before the movie I honestly didn't really get confused. The only thing that could have been explained a bit better was why Gales name was put in 42 times, and Prim's once.The character of Katniss was perfectly cast. Which is just as well because her character was in almost every scene and it was essential that they found the right girl to play her. The haunted look in her eyes, I really believed every emotion she was feeling, and felt so sorry for her. I felt sorry for all the kids. What a horrible world where this is what provides entertainment to the rich folk. Kids killing kids, all for the joy and amusement of others. When they first went into the arena I thought it was going to be a small field and it would be all over in five minutes.All of the actors were great though. I loved Josh Hutcherson is Bridge to Terabithia, but when he popped up on screen in the Hunger Games he was all grown up and a bit of a hottie. And after reading the books, he portrays Peeta perfectly.I hated the characters from Districts 1 and 2, what horrible kids, did they realise only one person could survive in the end, they were acting like they were going to emerge as the final four.Did anyone else think Prim looked like a young, blonde Winona Ryder?Anyway, fantastic movie, and the camera jumping around didn't bother me in the slightest.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Happy Hunger Games - May the Odds Be Ever In Your Favor,"In the ruins of what once known was North America, lies the futuristic nation of Panem. In the center of the country is the wealthy Capitol, inhabited by lavish-clothed citizens. Surrounding the rich Capitol is twelve outlying districts, each having a different industry and supplying materials for the Capitol. Some of the districts are wealthy (District 1: Luxury, District 2: Masonry, District 4: Fishing), while some are dead-poor (District 11: Agriculture, District 12: Coal mining).Before the film begins, the 13 districts fought with the Capitol, resulting in catastrophe, but eventually the Capitol won. The aftermath: the 12 districts were forced to annually give in a male and female between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the Hunger Games; the participants are called ""tributes"". The 13th District was, unfortunately, obliterated by the Capitol (sort of).Our heroine is sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen who comes from the poor District 12. She's received tesserae to meet the needs of her suffering family, in exchange for getting her name added additional times for the ""Reaping"" (the time when the names of the participants are randomly picked). When her sister's, Primrose Everdeen, name is unexpectedly drawn during the reaping (despite the fact that her name was only there for once), Katniss volunteers to take her place and enter the Hunger Games, a TV show which forces 24 ""tributes"" to fight to the death as a reminder to the rebellion 74 years ago.The heart of Panem, the Capitol is where the ""tributes"" undergo training (Katniss and Peeta have drunken Haymitch) and several interviews. Here, everything looks different from District 12. ""The showers are different"" (as Peeta says), the buildings are more colorful and the people there are lavishly-clothed. The citizens of the Capitol don't join the Games but they do are responsible for giving sponsors: some sort of gift received by the ""tribute"" during the Games. The sponsors depend on their opinions and these opinions usually depend on the ""tributes'"" scores given by the Gamemakers; each of the ""tributes"" are evaluated by the Gamemakers based on their skills and the higher the scores, the more likely chance they're going to get sponsors. After the evaluation, we get the interviews hosted by the eccentric Caesar Flickerman, and the Games begin in 3 ... 2 ... 1.The 24 ""tributes"" run at once in different directions, some to the tempting backpacks filled with valuable items, some clashing to kill some ""tributes"", some escaping to the wild.Pushing the PG-13 rating to its fullest, the Games do involve blood and some deadly kills. While Katniss and Peeta are relatively quiet, some of the Careers (""tributes"" who spent their entire lives practicing for the Games) are very brutal especially Cato of District 2. The Careers form a pack to kill the other ""tributes"" first before they kill each other until only one remains.""The Hunger Games"" is often compared to the ""Twilight"" films. They may have a similarity (a love triangle which places Katniss in the middle of Gale and Peeta), but the main focus of the film is not the love triangle. Katniss originally loved Gale but because of the ""Reaping"", Katniss allied with Peeta Mellark. That's basically what the love triangle covers. The love triangle is only a piece in a larger plot set in the dystopian future surrounding the Hunger Games.The film has an excellent cast. Putting Jennifer Lawrence as our heroine Katniss Everdeen is nothing but perfect. Coming off from an Oscar nomination two years ago, she's one to rise into super stardom. Her performance here is very convincing and very powerful that she deserves an Oscar right there on the spot. Her ability to show rage, nervousness, fear, determination, sadness, is just very spellbinding. John Hutcherson is also one not to be missed. His portrayal of Peeta Mellark is convincing also, being able to display nervousness, and fear. The others were also excellent: Alexander Ludwig plays Cato viciously, and brutally; Woody Harrelson plays the drunk Haymitch perfectly; Stanley Tucci portrays Caesar Flickman with charisma and style; Elizabeth Banks depicts Effie Trinket with meticulous details.The action is another thing the movie excels in. Although there might have not been a lot of intense explosions or ""Kabooms!"", the moments that take place in the Arena are thrilling likewise. The fight is not about action but more about hunting and survival skills. Katniss is relatively quiet, unlike the Careers who are more excited about getting into a fight where they are able to snap people's necks.The film is based on a novel, a novel I enjoyed immensely. With the author Suzanne Collins also playing a part in writing the screenplay, the movie is faithful to the book's contents. Although there are slight alterations, there are no major alterations that might change the course of the plot (such as ""Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief""). Anyone who has read the books will be pleased with how Gary Ross transformed the book into this film. Not a fan of the books, no problem, you can still enjoy this film. In other words, anyone can enjoy the film.Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: ""The Hunger Games"" is an action-packed drama that lives up to its massive hype and can be enjoyed by anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Pretty good, but could've been better.","May the odds be ever in your favor!The Hunger Games is a really good film, and I can only imagine how good the books must be (I gotta read them some time!). The world of the film fascinated me, the story was great, the characters as well, especially because of the great actors portraying them. Good special effects, OK action and good times at the movies.What I hated though, was the cinematography. The hand-held camera, the shaky-cam irritated me so much, I couldn't enjoy many parts of the film because of it. The fast-paced editing didn't help either! Sometimes things got so confusing, I couldn't tell what was going on on the screen. And the camera never stopped! It would've been great to let our eyes have some rest between poorly coordinated action scenes, but the darn camera just kept on moving! This has to stop. This style of shooting isn't good. Stop it. Please.Other than this unfortunate error, I enjoyed the movie. I haven't read the book, so I don't know how good the adaptation was, but I think the screenwriter(s) did a terrific job. There were a couple things I didn't like about the story though: the ending, which I found predictable, and someone's death, which I think was overemphasized. The love story seemed forced to me too, but maybe it was better written in the book. I also missed the twists. All the major plot points were in the trailer, so there weren't any surprises. I loved Stanley Tucci in the film and Jennifer Lawrence was a perfect action star.Another thing I didn't like was the PG-13 rating. Some scenes could've been so awesome, but the editors took away the sound, added some heart-braking music to the shakily shot scenes, making them hard to enjoy. The film could've had so much potential if the studio didn't want to stick to the lower rating. Blood and gore is fun! Especially when the theme of the movie is so brutal. People expect to see more, than just quick, shaky images that only imply the action, rather than show it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Cross Between ""Roller Ball"", ""1984"" and ""The Lottery"" Make for Fascinating Sci-Fi Drama","In Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" (1948), regarded as one of the most famous short stories in American literature, someone in a small rural town is selected by lottery to engage in the center of a yearly ritual which will cleanse the town of its sins. ""The Hunger Games"" presents a similar compelling premise. In the world of Panem, there is one Capitol and 12 districts. Before the events of the story, there were 13 districts which eventually rose up in rebellion, led by District 13. The Capitol was able to put down the rebellion, and District 13 was razed to the ground. However, the rebellion was not the end of the story, and the current dictator of Panem upholds a yearly tradition to remind the remaining districts of their violent past, called ""the Dark Days"".As punishment for the rebellion and as a reminder of who's ""in charge"", the Capitol hosts a violent pageant every year. Twenty-four young people of pre-college age are chosen by lottery to participate in the pageant; one boy and one girl from each district. The plot is a dark take on reality television contests: the pageant, called ""The Hunger Games"", requires the 24 tributes (they're not called contestants) engage in a fight-to-the-death contest in a wilderness-like arena controlled by unseen technicians in a war room of sorts. Only one tribute can be declared the winner at the end of the games, essentially requiring the other 23 tributes to perish. The games are broadcast on large screens so members of each district can watch the fates of their representatives. The event is hosted by a television game-show host/MC, Claudius Templesmith (Stanley Tucci), who makes Richard Dawson (of Family Feud fame) seem like a high-cultured gentleman. ""And may the odds be ever in your favor!"" is the motto of the Games.Of the 12 remaining districts, District 12 is the poorest, made up of primarily miners and other blood-and-sweat workers. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a teen girl who has self-taught herself to use the bow to hunt for game and sell in the town. On Tribute Day, all the youth from age 12 to 18 are brought to the town square where Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), a resident of the Capitol who, like many of her colleagues, enjoys wearing garish and flamboyant outfits, hosts the lottery ceremony. She picks Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields), Katniss' sister to participate. Katniss, stunned, offers to volunteer for the Games in her sister's stead. Since this is the first time someone has ever volunteered, the proposition is accepted by the State. The other tribute from District 9 is Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson).Katniss and Peeta are chaperoned by Effie Trinket to the Capitol on a bullet train. There they meet their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), a winner of the Hunger Games many years previously. He is there to help train and instruct Katniss and Peeta, but his highest priority seems to be drinking and snoozing. Eventually, Katniss and Peeta with interesting finesse convince Abernathy that they are worth helping.Once at the Capitol, they are paraded in front of the elite residents who cheer and decide which tributes they wish to root for. The tributes are then brought to a training facility, being told not to ""hurt"" any of the other tributes. They say there will be plenty of time for violent engagement relatively soon! They are treated like celebrities about to embark on a fashion pageant, being given beautiful outfits to wear during interviews. Of course, everyone knows the outcome of the pageant means 23 of the 24 tributes will not survive. Eventually, on the fateful day, the 24 tributes are transported to the arena-wilderness area where food and weapons are strewn about which can be used to better someone's chances. We also learn that the game is also ""rigged"". The control room doesn't just monitor the tributes but has power to influence situations. There are also ""sponsors"", Capitol residents, who can aid tributes they like. This story has become more relevant with the rise of ""fake news"" and distrust of television journalism with distorted media.Overall, a well-done and impassioned view of a bleak future which rings of Orwell's ""1984"" and the 1970's cult classic ""Roller Ball"". In ""Roller Ball"" two teams donning skates battle each other on a rink. In the final game, players can only leave the game if they're killed, which is essentially the same idea as ""The Hunger Games"". The film finds a good balance between the heartlessness of the competition (if competition it can be called) and the emotions of the characters. At one point, Katniss befriends a young African-American girl, Rue (Amandla Stenberg), who is obviously too young to be part of the games. They become allies to help each other defend against another ""gang"" who desires to kill them. One of the most touching and poignant moments of the film is their friendship and Rue's fate.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Truman Show meets Battle Royale? I had hoped so.,"Genre : Scifi/Action Big Names : Jennifer Lawrence Synopsis: The Hunger Games is based on the eponymous novel, the first of a trilogy penned by Suzanne Collins.Post apocalypse North America, now known as Panem, is now ruled by the autocratic President Snow, who each year conducts a gladiatorial combat contest where 2 teens, called 'tributes', from each of the 12 remaining 'districts' battle it out to death in front of all of Panem. The Truman Show meets Battle Royale? I had hoped so.Disclaimer: I had read the novel before watching the movie. As a result, comparisons to the book are inevitable. I have also watched The Truman Show and Battle Royale, which this movie remixed and gurgled out, inadequately.What's good: The novel was the first that I had been able to read cover to cover within 24 hours, in a really long time. While the concept of children killing each other in a scenario of complete societal breakdown is not new (Lord of the Flies), Collins did manage to put a decent spin on it and make it an interesting read. Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist, is a strong character and an ace archer and when she volunteers to take her little sister's place in the morbid contest, its hard to not root for her.Played by the gorgeous and fast-rising Jennifer Lawrence, Katniss genuinely comes across as a do-gooder and one who doesn't take things lying down. She is assisted in her conquest by the other tribute from District 12 -Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), who for me was one of the better actors in the movie.Stanley Tucci as the MC was entertaining. The only stand-out performer for me was Woody Harrelson who plays the District 12 mentor.What's not: Okay so I really did not enjoy the movie. Several reasons. The screenplay was highly unimaginative. With a fine crop of actors, I could not understand how the director managed to get such wooden performances out of everyone! In spite of its $100 million budget, the special effects looked shoddy and very 90s. The camera work was appalling – it was always too dark or too shaky. When you film two people going for each other's throat, you must film from a distance, not from 2 feet away! The editing was very off – several scenes just did not flow from the previous one.But the worst part was, the setting just could not match the imagery of Panem that I had in mind. It didn't even come close. But I guess, very few movies can do justice to the book. I hated the Harry Potter movies as well (No Emma Watson, I still do love you!).I think this movie just didn't know what it's target audience was. You want 2 dozen kids' throats to be brutally slit and you want to get a PG rating for the movie?! Even Harry Potter was much more adventurous in spite of its audience being 11-year olds.Verdict: The script may come across as inventive to people. Heck, I think a lot of people will actually really love this movie. But then I recommend watching The Truman Show and Battle Royale and reconsider your rating for this movie.My rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sponsored,"I am using a somewhat popular blogging platform (not google's) for workspace on a project I'm running on cinematic abstraction. I am not into the social aspect of it, though I have developed contacts. It just offers appealing options in the code. Now and then, as a kind of smoke break, I switch from personal work on my dashboard to the general stream of published content. I mostly filter for cinema, so suppose I am blocking out a lot of junk, but still, being able to tune in that channel of youthful stream-of-consciousness allows for some pretty cool observations.The age of average user in that place seems to be below twenty. They blog and reblog like crazy, with new posts arriving every minute. The level is several notches above Twitter, and predominantly visual. It goes beyond 'liking' something, to putting together some attractive personality. Items that get a lot of traction, within what is filtered by me, include fashion, urban nightscape photography, Sofia Coppola, everything tagged Dali and surrealism. There is the occasional Walt Whitman quote followed by pictures of waffles or movie stars.So, spending quite a bit of time with (partially) the target-group for this film, I have to report: a sizable portion of our youth is not dumb and desensitized, it seems to me, they may be melodramatic (youth seldom isn't), but they are curious, alert, visual creatures. They are looking for art that teases the imagination. In ten years time, some of them are going to be commendable artists.So, if I'm being honest, I would be much, much more accepting of something like this, if it was a spontaneous, say collaborative project generated by teenagers from that community. The focus would have been largely the same, I'm sure: stifled passions, cruel , dystopic adult world. But the personality?What we have here is that adults in the high corporate levels have made many of the same remarks, and here is the shrewd business plan: nicely package teenage dynamics inside the visual culture that consumes and defines them. It's a smart move, and this is the most acutely aware of the recent crop, so much so it makes (the first) Twilight seem naive and old Hollywood.What does this mean? The film is made from a lot of spare parts, as though reblogged (Battle Royale is only the most recent and obvious). It is shot as a fast-moving stream of visual snippets that is not at all the Bourne effect: the idea here is less the first-person character experience, and more of a comfortable cognitive map for a young audience growing up on internet and instant interconnectivity. It takes place in a world that venerates spectacle and celebrity, with the Gamers paraded around 'tinseltown' like the hottest new MTV stars. The battleground arena is filmed by hundreds of cameras that instantly connect everywhere, including the skies.So far so good, an effectively aligned version of contemporary pop culture. The action once it kicks in is formulaic, but that is because the guys running this have no imagination: you can observe the director of the Games and his team of assistants, every decision they make to affect the gameflow, instead of perhaps intelligently structuring the situation is absolutely contrived and geared for special-effects: most of all, nondescript monsters to speed-up the finale. The artistic personality, since every decision is of an artistic nature, is simply unappealing.But, here's the catch that entirely sinks this: like a bunch of smarmy, Victorian-era schoolteachers, adults responsible for this - the 'sponsors' for the event - couldn't resist imposing on the teenage playground fun with a combination of finger-wagging, 1984-style fearmongering about the future, and sensationalized movie-treatment of suffering.The film was designed in the vein of, hinges its entire appeal, and probably used every channel of that visual culture to access an audience, then turns around and claims that culture is decadent, exploits and degrades.Moreover, it attempts, this multimillion dollar product, to remind us that outside of the comfortably-numb limits of reality TV and the internet, in the real world out there persists hunger, inequality, and poverty. The lead is played by a girl who two years ago in Winter's Bone had to eke out a miserable existence in southern Missouri, another clue of short-sighted imagination, casting her because she was good there. The downbeat scenario is replicated whole here, including the killing of squirrels for food.In other words: ""sit down in the multiplex to have fun with this thing you have seen advertised on TV and across the internet, while we lecture with important statements on the state of the world.""If I was sixteen now, maybe I wouldn't know it, but I believe that younger self would deserve much better. So if you are that age and looking for something that nourishes with rejection, I would turn you over to something like Godard's Breathless or Harmony Korine's Gummo: rebellious films made by young filmmakers in the effort to capture a little something of what it means to live in the world. Breathless (conventionally) popularized the jump-cut that is the main device here, but was using it as a breach with established ways of seeing. It was radical in its time, and you deserve something radical in yours.This is the 'sponsored' version, where adults take your money while pretending to educate.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

There is one similarity of these two movies, both have the same cheap feel and looks. Although i liked this setting much more, it was more appealing.What i didn't liked is at some part i got the feeling i was watching Avatar with the shots in the Arena control room.The movie is too short or the first half is to long and not much time left fro the second part. I got the feeling it was been rushed to much at the end. The fist part, everything was been buildup nicely, after-then all seems to be rushed and no time for better involving within the arena.Anyway, it's a nice movie to watch, i give it a 6.5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Directors: Wonderfully done,"This was such a wonderful movie. My fiancé picked it out for all of us to watch last night. Needless to say, he thought I would not like it. I told him go ahead and put it on. I was really impressed by the whole movie. I didn't really care for the snapping of the neck scenes or bloody parts, but it was excellent. I definitely agree with my fiancé that there will be a sequel up next. Great job to both the lead actors of this film. I hope they get paid well and if there is a sequel that both of them star in it as well. It was just that good. I watched Bernie last night prior to this and let me tell you, it was completely boring. The movie was ridiculous. I was so happy to have rented the Hunger Games. Great job to the whole cast.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Battle Royale mixed with Twilight,"This must be one of the most hyped films over here in Europe this summer and naturally I took precautions to watch it due the fact that hyped flicks mostly fail for me.The Hunger Games are based on a book and here things already go wrong. It is loosely based on the book. I just will refer to the dogs at the end of this flick, here they are created by the masters of the game. In the book they are the dead that resurrect into dogs. A big difference and also one of the reasons that shows that it was made for the youngsters among us. While the books have a lot of blood and gore the flick doesn't show us anything of that.But is it all that bad, no, there are a few good actions taking place and it never bored me but it failed by choosing for a flick that fits for whole the family. By saying that it brings me back to another trilogy I doesn't like, Twilight. The way the lover birds are talking does take you back to Twilight.I was more into the brutal Immortals (2012) a flick that failed for others but worked out fine for me. If you like The hunger Games but would prefer it a bit rougher then I should recommend Battle Royale (2000) but let's wait for the remake of Battle Royale coming out in 2015 if it will be like the original one.Effects and acting was okay but it's a trilogy I wont follow any more.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is the number 1 movie of 2012 (My Opinion),Many movies that there is nowadays are either rip-offs or so badly constructed that it doesn't make sense to make it..This however takes a concept that hasn't been used for years (Battle Royale) and puts it in between Twilight and such films.. It's different.It's one of those movies that you watch in the cinema and then you either watch it again or buy it right when it comes out on Blu-Ray and watches it again. This movie is almost perfect in my opinion and not that many movies are so good nowadays!THE BIG HIT! - If you haven't watched it then go watch it.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
DON'T watch this movie if you haven't read & liked the books,"I went to see this movie by accident, so I had no preconceived idea nor did I have any idea this comes out from a book series.Let's put it straight: As a standalone movie, this is ABYSMAL! Just when reading the other reviews, I learned that the movie is an adaptation of a trilogy of books (and even a bad one, apparently). That actually might explains why the movie made no sense at all to me.The characters are the most shallow I have seen in years. The story is nothing original and looks like it could fit on a post-it. Filming is lackluster and special effects (if any) are no better than a standard TV show. Action is nearing zero and the ending is just plain ridiculous, even as a (non-)cliffhanger for further movies.Apparently, A LOT of context was left out of the movie from the books, which is hardly excusable as the movie is long and slooowwww, so it can only be described as support material for the books, not as a standalone movie of any value.Bottom line: If you didn't read the books, don't even consider going to see this ""thing"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The American battle royale,I think not","The hunger games is a wonderful film that is angaging from start to finish.I really enjoyed this film and what it had to offer.The action was done well even though the camera was shaky it still had that emotional grip during the action sequences.This film has the basic plot of battle royale young adults killing each other and thats it.The hunger games is sent up in a world were people watch all this violence in amusement and shock.The actiing from jennifer lawrence is to die for she gives a eye opening performance.Also josh hutcherson who was stuck in child actor nirvana for a while shines in this well.Woody harrelson and lenny kravitz did a fine job as well.Donald sutherland does a in the shadows performance.For a PG-13 film it is quite dark and grim especially when the action kicks in and when characters talk about the whole idea of the hunger games.If you want a brutal,sometimes jaw dropping but emotional experience watch the hunger games.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It was simply entertaining.,"How you feel about this movie and rate it, is in my opinion very depended on the fact whether or not you had seen ""Battle Royale"" prior to this movie. If you have seen it, you will see this movie as a bit of a lesser version of basically the same concept but if you haven't, you'll probably be taken by this movie and it's daring and unusual concept.Personally, I had seen ""Battle Royale"" and it's actually one of my favorite movies as well. So no, I'm not overpraising this movie for its originality but I also had some more general problems with it as well, which prevented me from seeing this movie as an absolutely perfect, or a must-see- for everyone.Nothing wrong with its concept or overall story really but the storytelling was still a bit lacking at times. It doesn't always have a right balance of action, social commentary or drama in it, to make an effective enough impact with any of it. The first half of the movie is actually quite slow once you start thinking back about it and it takes a bit too long with its buildup. You could all 'blame' this really on the fact that this movie got based on a popular novel, by Suzanne Collins. Certain storytelling techniques make this apparent and it are little things like this that cause the movie too slow down a bit too much at times.But obviously it didn't bother me all too much, since I still could enjoy the movie. I never really saw this movie as a deep or provoking one but it was one that was very entertaining to watch. It's a real good thing that lots of money get pumped into this movie, since it truly lifts it to greater heights. It uses good looking special effects (it's also a science-fiction movie after all) and some spectacular action.You might be surprised at how violent this movie can be to watch at times. You might not expect this coming from a movie that features a couple of teens, as the movie its leads but that's actually what the whole movie is all about, with some bit more depth behind it but not all too much really. It doesn't ever delves deep enough into things or explains everything properly. You could complain about this, or you could simply take it and sit back and enjoy the ride, just as I did.The movie also does a good job at creating a certain atmosphere. It's set in the future but not a too distant future. So basically that means that this isn't really a too futuristic looking movie and is easy to place yourself into. The look and settings do feel a bit odd at times but never in a too overdone or not realistic enough type of way.It's certainly watchable as entertainment but I wouldn't exactly call it the movie of the year.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I did NOT read the books and still enjoyed the film,"I should tell you right up front that I have never read ""The Hunter Games""--so this review is more for this group of folks than the die-hard book lovers. In many cases, I have no idea where the book and film differ and my expectations were quite different from my daughter--who has read the series. However, one this that DID bother me is that despite the film's title, no one appeared to be all that hungry in the film and the way food was used to manipulate and control the masses was not explained well. The only way I knew this was that my daughter sat next to me and explained this (and it helps that we both know sign language). But apart from that and the god-awful 'shaky cam"" (one of the WORST inventions in the history of filmmaking), the film was enjoyable and engrossing throughout. As I said, though, the shakiness of the film (especially at the beginning) was a problem--and I felt motion sick just watching the movie! The plot and movie have already been discussed in a bazillion reviews. The film has already been out about 45 days when I saw it tonight, so I don't want to give a lengthy review. Instead, I'll talk about what I liked. Foremost, the acting was really, really nice. I cared about the characters I was supposed to care about and it tore my guts out when one of them was killed in the film--showing what a nice job they did and how well the director elicited the performances. I liked the story a lot--especially since I love dystopian sci-fi films. In many ways it was like combining the original ""Rollerball"" and, perhaps, ""Gladiator""! It was truly original and kept me riveted. All in all, a terrific film--well worth your time provided you don't mind the violence necessary to convey the story. However, despite the books being very popular with kids, I would think twice about bringing any kids younger than about 12 or 13.]",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent adaptation,"I liked this movie. It is well thought out from start to finish. I know this is an adaptation from a novel so the story really isn't relevant. ( It is a relevant story though.) Did i say liked? Loved!Mr. Ross knows how to make a story his. And he does so here with a good deal of skill. It starts with a nightmare, and this movie is about a nightmare. A well directed nightmare. If you do not think this can happen then think of all the many many millions of people who think it already has happened in many ways.This aside from the science fiction aspects.This film hits a nerve in many places! And maybe more than just a nerve!Conversely think of the parents who would love to have there children compete in such games and be very proud of each and every kill.I liked Jennifer Lawrence's performance because she carries a very well acted movie on her shoulders. That and with a character that while charismatic not so as say Dr. Hannibal Lecter (dark) or Father Chuck O'Malley.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Read the book first.......,"OK, so I just watched the Hunger Games.......... You should really read the book before going to see this movie. A lot was left out and the entire movie was rushed. I enjoyed the movie and thought it was good but from reading the book first, I was able to fill in a lot of the blanks. There was a lot of the movie that stayed true to the book but had I not read the book first, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much.By reading the book first you can actually feel and understand what's going on mentally, physically and emotionally with the characters, all while the movie is rushed from one scene to another up until you get to the actual games. Even though the movie was 2 1/2 hours long, it still seemed like that if you didn't read the book, there's stuff you would not understand or feel regarding the character, their families, their home and their districts.The scenery setting for the entire movie is pretty close to how I pictured it while read the book.I give the movie a 7 and say that it's worth seeing if you read the book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It ain't all that...,"The reviews for this movie are ridiculous, I can't understand where all the high ratings are comings from (Possible hormones?). The actors are competent, a mile better than that twilight rubbish - decent cast; but the implementation of the filming and the way the story is portrayed is poor. Most people will have read the books, if not - do, the film is a poor reflection. Not enough focus on the circumstance the people have been forced to live under, nice scenes up until the hero's get to district 1, but pre-arena and in the arena the story changes from telling the story to a number of poorly imagined variations of the set pieces in the book, to such an extent that it gets embarrassing to watch. Each 'major' scene is trimmed to its absolute minimal essence and does not link well chronologically. Suddenly Katniss finds some random blood and voilà, there is Peter? I'm sorry - but cake decorating and being Leonardo DaVinci in body painting, with no links or explaining material? Absolute rot, and just accepting on one or two arrow shots that Katniss is ""Herne the Hunter"" reborn does not scan well, and without the books support its a bit of a head nod ""Yeah right"" for too much of her exploits.I saw Pirates on the same day, which blew me away, creative, good characters and story and compared to a poorly told story with a huge budget; I would take it any day of the week.Imagine ""The Golden Compass"" but a better story and acting; i.e. it still sucks like a kid on a MacDonalds milkshake; but you don't feel 'quite' as bad for the production crew...Also, almost nobody has mentioned how its a blatant rip-off of The Running Man - only with teenagers, The Running Man is superior in so may respects, but this film has the advertisers buck and a lot of money men rubbing their hands. Lets hope this overrated debacle improves in the second and (groan) third parts.Don't get me wrong, the film with such a small amount of change in the direction and a few better linking scenes could have been excellent, but as it stands it simply isn't a good film. One of the main bugbears is the lack of involvement from the outside world when the combatants are in the arena; a few poorly chosen scenes and some weird sky-dome CG - nothing of Haymitch's efforts on the outside, crowd reactions to internal events, sponsors gifts etc... (I'm sorry - but the soup scene after so much focus on this aspect in the books, is simply poor storytelling) just random unjustified huge escalations in the social situations, which also does not bear out the book. i.e. the populace has been watching this show for 74 years, yet all of a sudden one of the contestant dies (The young herb girl, uh-huh) yet now they are so peeved they revolt violently. 5-6 out of 10 is fair, but for the money they spent and the advertising overdrive 4 is more accurate.If you haven't read the books, you'll wonder what all the fuss is about, and if you did read the books - you will moreso.Wait for the DVD; or better still don't watch it - suckers to the advertisers one and all :-(",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Read the book or the odds will not be in your favour,"The Hunger Games is a good adaptation of good material. As a reader of the first book but not the sequels, I liked how Katniss was an independent and strong character and that it's a teen lit novel that doesn't become a love story. The idea is great (I'm a firm Battle Royale fan) but the writing was only fair- too many cheap cliffhangers- but I felt that it would translate excellently to the screen. However I was able to avoid the hype and hold a very neutral, yet educated stance.The structure of the book is intact. From start to finish the film is very faithful, with the only exception being that a flashback is told sporadically in the film instead of being laid out early in the book. The time distribution however is not equal throughout the film: the first act is skimmed through. It gets the plot rolling quickly, but the characters suffer- something that happens a lot. Gale, Prim and Mom see so little screen time, which makes The Reaping feels very wrong. It seems too quiet and empty, despite silence being the point of it.Very early we get to the Capitol, which is lushly realized despite some very plain visual effects. The costumes and locales are ridiculous, extravagant and ignorant like the citizens who wear and occupy them. And the Games itself jump right out of the book.There's two major, looming problems with the film, which are the assumptions filmmakers made about you and removing the narrator. Suzanne Collins, the author of the books, co-wrote the screenplay. So in her mind, it is assumed you know anything she leaves out of the film because you have to have read the book. For example, who Foxface is. Readers know, but if you are in the dark you probably won't understand until her arc is completed. In fact, most characters disappear in the film- Thresh gets one line, Clove, and Rue even. The thing that could have rectified this problem was taken out of the film: Katniss' thoughts. The perspective changed in transfer to objective, meaning we only see what happens, no thoughts about them. Katniss' thoughts could explained so much that didn't need to be shown and wasn't. Maybe a full blown narration wouldn't have worked, but even hearing her think to herself sometimes, or hearing things others said earlier, or even Nathan Drake (Uncharted) style talking to herself could've fleshed out the world and made the film easier to stomach for those who didn't read.There are more issues though. The camera gets ridiculous. Understandably, not all of the violence could be shown on screen, but the action shots here are sickeningly unfocused and uninspired. A late change to the 'dogs' makes the scene impersonal and has the cheapest scare I've ever seen in a PG film, and like the source material there's not much closure. Despite a healthy 2:20 runtime, characters are really underdeveloped (Peeta's alliance has no repercussions or explanation, mind-boggling), and it still feels slow in some areas. The visual effects are lazy- the flaming dress is SO BAD- it put very dangerous words in my head: cash in.There are some great performances though. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is perfect, strong and unaffected by men, and the film thankfully has even less forced romance than the book. And while it's not played up for excitement, she kicks some ass for survival. Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) makes the best of any support. He's captivating, a clearly haunted and tired character, but still humorous and helpful. Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) is a character I can't even remember from the book, and I'm conflicted about him. Some parts he seems too nice to be the Gamemaker, and in others he seems too cruel, but he gets a fantastic last scene that I think was the best original thing they added. It's very poetic. Lastly Cato (Alexander Ludwig) is the primary tribute antagonist, and I always pictured a very intimidating young man playing him. So while the casting isn't the best for him, he's convincingly vicious.The atmosphere slips sometimes. Some parts nail the desperation and horror of the event, but others actually coaxed laughter from the audience like a very important and tense last scene from the book that had the whole theater giggling- still not sure if it was intended to be comedic.The Hunger Games has its ups and downs, but a solid core. It's a fair adaptation of material heavier than its developed audience and it shows in the film that the goal is to make lots of money from fans. It's a good couple of hours but not an especially memorable film. If you're a fan of the novels you'll love because you'll actually understand it, but if you're like me, on the fringe, or haven't read them at all, don't feel too bad if you miss this one. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Very Good, With Some Minor Issues","The Hunger Games, did a splendid job, especially considering all of the hype it had leading up to its release. For me the Hunger Games is kind of like Harry Potter, except a little bit past my time, and not as good. As much as I enjoyed this movie, there were quite a few things that bothered me, as well as a number of great moments. Let's start with the negatives: 1) Too many awkward close ups 2) Not enough complexity, or showing of how the characters really feel, like it was in the novel 3) Pg-13, the novel was R-rated, I'm not saying that violence makes a movie, but in the case of the Hunger Games it actually does. Now for the positives: 1) Great Acting 2) Tense, well directed action scenes 3) Brilliant use of CGI 4) Very good at putting a face to the characters we read about. In the end, this movie without a doubt deserves an 8/10, and that isn't anything to sneeze at. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is even remotely interested, or whoever read the novel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I watched Ghost Rider 2 other week and that is a 1/10. The lead role and some of the action scenes give it an automatic 6/10 in my book.Ridiculous ignore the haters and the people saying it does not live up to the book or whatever and just watch it.

Lacks the intensity and sting,"Suzanne Collins' novel The Hunger Games has been garnering a significant amount of fame with teenagers everywhere, and has a devoted legion of fans who have already seen this film at one of its notorious midnight showings. I have never read the novel, but knew much about it going in. Going out, I might've known less. If that's possible.The film is simple, moderately effective entertainment, but slow, a tad incompetent, and a bit overblown in some areas. The film centers around the nation of Panem, which has replaced North America. It is a totalitarian nation, with its government inflicting harsh punishments and dictatorship this way and that. Every year, they hold an event called ""The Hunger Games,"" where two people, a male and a female from each of the twelve districts of Panem, battle to the death until one remains. It is done to further assure the Capitol has any and all authority, and that they can do what they want, when they want. No question.The girl chosen from District 12 is Prim Everdeen (Shields), younger sister of sixteen year old Katniss (Lawrence) who volunteers to take her place. The boy chosen from the district is Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson), who has had a life-long crush on Katniss. Both are taken from the district to train relentlessly for the games, which involve mainly practicing their archery skills. By far the most entertaining character in the whole film is Haymitch, portrayed wonderfully by Woody Harrelson, the only living victor from District 12. He mentors both Katniss and Peeta as they enter the most grueling task of their life.Let's start with the landscapes and the cinematography. When we see them, they are wonderful. Breathtaking and consuming. But director Gary Ross seems to enjoy seeing them through a shaky, indistinct position. It may not be his own fault, just his lack of credible experience. A good portion of the film and its battle scenes are captured with a shaky camera, possibly to add to the idea that the action is so fast-paced and non-linear the camera can't keep up. Even during some of the regular scenes the camera remains this way. It would've been nice if The Hunger Games could capture its battle scenes in a calm, collective, and controlled manner, but instead, it favors the route of incoherency and disjointedness.From a stylistic approach, the film is rather nice to look at. We do get well-deserved backstory on how the country operates and functions, but we don't learn enough about our leads. Also, these characters are being grossly toyed with in this nation. Does anyone try to rebel or overthrow the government? Or are they so oblivious to the idea of dictatorship and develop a strong contentment for this world. It seems illogical, when you think about it.The Hunger Games has its areas of strength. For one, its female leader is no priss. It's so rare to see women take charge in sci-fi adventure films, especially ones that follow this sort of formula. Jennifer Lawrence is strong and beyond capable as the role of a strong woman, victim to unfair circumstances, and manipulated by an unfair society. It's nice to see that the series looks at her as fearless and fit rather than a whiny, uninspired female caricature. Hutcherson, too, is very good and the two work together nicely when they can.But this is pretty standard in the field of adventures, in areas excluding its plot and acting. It lacks any sort of commentary on totalitarian societies, and doesn't seem to break new ground with the material it has. I sat debating on why the series has reached such a rare level of popularity with the masses. Is this the groundbreaking, extra-special, page-gripping novel that everyone is reading? The book had to be more than predominant scenes of archery and hectic instances of action. There had to be more depth and attraction to a novel so popular. What we are left with is somewhat sufficient, but droning for a two and a half hour film, including tacked on, roughly seventy minutes of buildup to the games themselves. The Hunger Games isn't bad, but it's redundant and winded, with much of the end being rather quiet and seemingly void of progression. Audiences are likely to enjoy it, but I'm sure fan reception will be all over the place. The film just seems too basic and limp, considering the book was a smashing success.Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland.

An excellent stand-alone film that doesn't belong in a series,"After last year's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 famously hammered the nail in the coffin of the beloved Potter franchise, many avid teenage readers and moviegoers searched frantically for another dependably exciting adventure series to fill the aching, gaping hole that was left after the worldwide heartbreak. The fact that many of them believe that they've found it with Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games will, it seems, mitigate the power of what is really an inspired, intelligent, brilliantly crafted fable and provide egoistic film critics with the perfect ammunition to blast away the threat to their vain conservatism.This should never have really been a series, because it works on the same level as other eerie futuristic pieces such as George Orwell's fascinating 1984 or Ridley Scott's rickety but well-intentioned Blade Runner (1982). Books or films belonging to a pre-mediated fantasy or science fiction series usually end quite inconclusively and mysteriously, with a neat explanation being provided in the final instalment. This perfectly packaged ending is made possible by the disconnect from the real world, but The Hunger Games is very much focused on harsh realities and palpable, relatable ambiguities, or at least it was until the sequel Catching Fire was published in 2009. The main premise of the story might have been typical of teenage entertainment – yet nevertheless exciting – but the insightful earlier and later passages are what set it apart from mainstream blockbuster entertainment.As most people know, the story centres on young Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) who struggles to support her family and to cope personally in a brutal dystopian future. She lives in the last of twelve strictly separated districts that get progressively poorer, although each has been oppressed severely by the Capitol, particularly after the great insurrection that occurred several decades before Katniss' birth. This is where one of the story's most unique aspects comes in, in that the violent and passionate rebellion that usually takes centre stage in these stories has come and gone unsuccessfully, and has had adverse effects on the later generations. Now, every year, the Capitol draws names out of a ballot and takes a boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18, gives them a brief bit of training and places them all in an arena in a gruelling fight to the death that becomes a twisted reality television show for the entire population. Katniss volunteers as a tribute after her fragile, 12-year-old sister is called up, along with the humble and kindly Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) who is just as convinced that he will lose because of his useless fighting skills as he is that Katniss will win because of her determination and hunting experience, and is eager for them to pose as ""star-crossed lovers"" in order to gain publicity and extra assistance from sponsors.What follows is their navigation of a perilous moral, philosophical, physical and emotional minefield whilst they try to find a balance between staying true to themselves and their personal beliefs, even if it means defying the Capitol, and being strategic and adaptable enough to survive. It would be a very laborious task to describe the many details of these rich plot developments, but due mention must go to a few of the most intriguing characters, and the actors that so impressively embody them. Liam Hemsworth effectively plays the supporting character of Gale, Katniss' best friend, who always optimistically insists that they should flee to the forest to live as nature intended and be free of the Capitol. He is just as likable as Peeta, and both are naïve and coldly realistic in their own way. 12- year-old newcomer Amandla Stenberg beautifully captures the innocence and cheekiness of Rue, a gentle but elusive young tribute who is incredibly adept at climbing. Jack Quaid, another newcomer, somehow manages to mask his natural warmth in order to play an insufferably pompous yet undeniably tough and dangerous competitor from the wealthier area of district 1, where tributes are fiercely trained from a young age and volunteer with pleasure to slaughter the poorer citizens. As for Katniss herself, the still unsteady Jennifer Lawrence has proved to be the perfect casting choice. Our heroine is very similar to her Oscar- nominated role in Winter's Bone (2010) and no doubt she's used many of the same characterisation techniques to portray this tough, earthy yet very sympathetic character, but here she has refined her acting skills enough to make the audience like her as well as the Academy. Josh Hutcherson has also been very well cast as Peeta, being very believable and incredibly moving. It is a pleasure to see him still acting well and prominently after his terrific efforts as a child actor in the last decade, and hopefully he will make the transition to serious adult actor. Lenny Kravitz portrays another powerfully sympathetic character, Cinna, the only Capitol official who recognises the cruelty and harshness of the Hunger Games and extends a gentle, helping hand towards Katniss. Indeed, the upper class is a ghastly sight. Respected actors Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Toby Jones and Elizabeth Banks stagger on screen as outrageously dressed, ridiculously drunk, shamelessly shallow and often shockingly heartless bureaucrats that appear to be caricatures at first glance, but eventually one realises that as far as representations of government officials go they couldn't be more realistic.A story such as this could never have a concrete ending and remain believable, and unfortunately, by giving it an ending across two sequels, Suzanne Collins has ruined this marvellous fable's chances of ever being taken seriously by anyone over the age of twenty. Still, make sure you experience this fantastic book and film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jennifer Lawrence is the Girl on Fire...,"The best thing about this movie is Jennifer Lawrence and her performance. All doubters & naysayers should eat their words, as Lawrence proves more than up to the task of completely embodying the character of Katniss Everdeen. She's every bit as intelligent, fierce, vulnerable, resourceful as the character requires and more. The majority of the film rests on Lawrence's shoulders, and if she hadn't been up to the task, everything would have fallen apart. You have to believe/care about this girl, Katniss, and her portrayer ensures that you certainly do. Her scenes of sorrow are very heart-wrenching, it must be said. Initially someone who would rather stay hidden in trees than kill, she eventually reaches the point where she has to kill or be killed. She doesn't outright kill people at first, but rather does things which lead to people's deaths (if not at her hand directly). Inevitably, though, she does wind up getting her hands dirty in the end.Also important is the character of Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and his friendship with Katniss. Through minimal flashbacks, we see how they met and why they are what they are to each other. Hutcherson fits the role of the likable guy, capturing that fear and despair upon being selected, then later the determination to rebel against what's expected of him. This relationship proves pivotal to the story and both actors absolutely bring it, having the right chemistry required. Not sure why such a big deal was made out of Gale (Liam Hemsworth, who has yet to prove himself to be up to the same standard of acting as his brother, Chris), friend of Katniss, having his role expanded in the film - he's barely in it. He shares two scenes with Katniss, and the rest is longing looks.Elizabeth Banks is great in the role of eccentric and slightly scary-looking Effie Trinket. She's virtually unrecognizable in her first scene, but slightly less so in subsequent scenes. She provides the main source of what little humour is in the film. Woody Harrelson, as Games survivor Haymitch, starts out as the stereotypical drunkard, but becomes more interesting as he helps out both Katniss & Peeta with how they can ensure the odds are indeed ever in their favour. The unexpected casting of Lenny Kravitz as stylist Cinna turns out to have been a good choice. With what little screen time he has, he believably forms an attachment to Katniss and ensures she looks fabulous (which ends up being rather important). I enjoyed the scenes with these characters.Somewhat wasted are Wes Bentley as Seneca Crane and Donald Sutherland as President Snow. They're in a few scenes, but don't really leave THAT much of an impression (not nearly as much as Bentley's weird facial hair does anyway). And while Stanley Tucci was very good in the role of Caesar, he wound up being mainly exposition guy (explaining stuff we already knew or could figure out ourselves). Not faring much better are the various other Tributes - most of whom are of the 'everyone for himself/herself' mentality (even when they seemingly team up). It's certainly cutthroat, sometimes literally. People get slashed, stabbed, their necks broken, shot with arrows and stung by horrible wasp things called Tracker Jackers, which turn you all gnarly and swollen. The frustrating shaky cam is WAY overdone at times, even when people are just simply walking (the Reaping scene), but particularly later on when they're fighting and killing (the Cornucopia scenes). Due to the camera's wild shaking, the scenes of violence are not really that detailed and the fighting is at times hard to follow. Kills are either done quickly/not lingered upon or they are edited around. It'll be a question of whether this bothers you/how much you *let* it bother you that determines whether you come away satisfied or annoyed with how the brutality in the film is portrayed on screen. Is it enough that you get the gist of the horrible murders being committed, or do you need to SEE them in explicit detail? Having said that, it's not like there's a complete absence of blood or anything. There is a fair amount, it's just not especially gory/gratuitous. One Tribute who does leave some actual impact is Rue (Amandla Stenberg). This young actress proves herself a natural in her role. Thanks to the actors playing them, Katniss and Rue are able to form a believable alliance/friendship, despite being given very little time to do it in (and, in Stenberg's case, very little dialogue). It's quite remarkable how quickly you come to care about the two of them as a team, which makes what comes later actually effective/have weight and depth. The Mockingjay call they whistle to each other is quite haunting, as is Lawrence's singing.The costumes are stunning...if a little frightening, the sets and scenery are luscious, and the CGI is fairly good (though there are some questionable giant wolf-like creatures at one point). The pacing of the film is...well...I'm not sure how it is in the book, but things did seem to drag here and there at several points (and the ending was rather lacklustre). I'm surprised people were worried the runtime wouldn't be long enough, as I felt it was more than sufficient. I haven't read the books, but knew the gist of what this film was about, so I elected to go into the movie not having read the novels so that I could enjoy the film based solely on its own merits. Perhaps readers of the book will be more satisfied, as they will appreciate the little or 'slower' parts more than non-readers. I think upon re-watching the film, I might appreciate them more too. I can't rate it as an adaptation, but I can say that, as it stands, this is a pretty decent introductory film for those who haven't read the books - being one myself. Here's hoping for even greater things from the next movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A decent ride,I don't know how being a super critic works but I do know one thing. This movie has not been reviewed fairly at all. You gotta look past the book okay movies that are based on book are going to be different from the film always because books are a bundle of words on a page. Unless your running time is 7 hours for the film naturally you have to cut and paste all I am saying to you hardcore book fans out there is be aware of that. Films and books are two completely different mediums. As for some reviews on this film I failed to see the Blair witch camera work relations at all. The movie was shot quite decently there it's an action film the camera needs to move around in order to bring the audience in if the camera just sat on a tripod you'd complain that the action got away from you. Great fight choreography well written story with some good direction. The cast was wonderful in their performances the only two thing that bugged me were the fact that glimmer died at all and the starship flying over head in the forest. All in all a decent ride.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Kids killing bloodily each other plus discriminations against people,"I can not understand how this can be a source of entertainment. In my opinion, the story is about a hypothetical society that discriminates and disgust against other human beings. The people is delighted watching on TV a bloody, morbid and perverse competition, where innocent children are forced to kill each other, to survive just one of them. The children reflect very well on their faces, own innocence of a child and the panic of knowing what is going to happen. I guess to direct a film where getting children to convey the panic on their faces, or the pleasure of being the winner of a bloodily competence, killing another, should at least have caused some bad dream to the director",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
similar to Battle Royale,"The book Hunger Games was published in 2008 and the film released in 2012. It shows a sophisticated society. Although it is impossible not to notice all the similarities with the Japanese film Battle Royale, released in 2000, eight years before. In this film, students are kidnapped in a excursion trip and wake up with a head-explosive-collar. They were selected to a life and death game with only one survivor or none at all. Each one receive a backpack with food, drink, lantern and one weapon or survival device. Each six hours they are informed about the dead and the danger zones to be avoided in order not to explode their necks. Alliances are made and death follows the smallest suspicion. Previous infatuations and enmities are explicit. Enfasis centers in the animal inside all of us and how thick is the civil layer of our personalities and our survival willingness. Hunger Games is much more complex, however it is impossible to deny so many similarities",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"I Was ""Hungry"" for More","Although the movie was unlike the book in some ways, the movie blew me away. I bet many of these reviews would be much better if there was no book, although the book is amazing. I was left hanging when the games started, and even though the beginning was a little slow, it was very nice to see how Katniss changes throughout and how once quiet, now brave and strong. Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Lenny Kravitz, Woody Harleson, Willow Shields, Liam Hensworth, Elizabeth Banks, Issabele Furman, Alexander Ludwig and the rest of the cast did an amazing job. But the person who stood out the most was Jennifer Lawrence. She did amazing acting and did as well as she did in the movie Winters Bone. If you want a good movie, get some money and go see The Hunger Games...my top movie.After all, The Hunger Games was a fresh piece of paper with outstanding never before seen drawings on it. This movie is worth the money.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Such a huge disappointment,"I think the book is great, but this is not the book! It's almost unwatchable, it's such a mess. They changed key factors for the movie, like where the mockingjay pin came from, and the meaning of it. They cut out all of the violence and nudity, as well as key scenes that developed the characters and their relationships, making this movie feel incomplete and jumbled together. I mean there was no back story for Haymitch, Gale,or any of the Tributes, other than a few lines. Imagine reading a book and stopping in the middle of a sentence and skipping every other line, and sometimes entire chapters! The movie feels completely rushed with no direction and horribly edited. The director should be shot. I've seen better direction on an episode of Jersey Shore! Though the actors do a great job with what pieces of the script weren't cut out. The entire movie I kept waiting for commercials to come on, like I was watching network TV. I'm not sure where the $78,000,000 went! If you've never read the book, it might not be too bad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hunger Games,"""The Hunger Games"" is brilliant story told through the eyes of 16 year old Katniss Everdeen. It's also based on a series of books by author Suzanne Collins. In this action packed Katniss is an independent girl who tries her best to care for her young sister and unstable mother. When her young sister Prim is chosen to take part in the deadly ""Hunger Games"", a fight to the death for safety, riches, fame, and freedom Katniss decides to take Prim's place to fight for her sister. The film takes place in the country of Panem which is a post apocalyptic North America. The acting was great. The cinematography was good also. The film was dramatic but not too over the top. It really showed the struggle that the characters faced throughout the film.The country of Panem was divided into 13 districts. After an uprising The Capitol decided to destroy District 13, leaving the country with only 12 Districts. As a way to remember the lives lost during the rebellion that took place decades earlier the Capitol started ""The Hunger Games"". Two people (1 boy, 1 girl) from each of the 12 districts that North America is divided into after the uprising have to fight to the death. Only one is left standing. Fighting for her life, Katniss competes with 23 other people, Katniss and Peeta are representatives of District 12. They come from a dark depressing District full of coal miners. Peeta and Katniss soon find themselves working together to eliminate the other players. Soon a friendship forms between them that could kill them or save them both.An aspect of the film that I really enjoyed was the acting; I loved it. The chemistry between the characters was believable. When the characters didn't particularly like it each other it was convincing. The style of acting in the movie went well with the plot. It wasn't too dramatic and it also wasn't depressing. The actors knew how to act in that moment. I especially thought Jennifer Lawrence did great in her portrayal of Katniss. If you've ever read the books Katniss seems to not care about anyone except her young sister and Jennifer really showed that in the film. The way Jennifer acted when her character didn't like someone was very believable. Katniss isn't very emotional or friendly, which is another thing Jeniffer portrayed well. I also enjoyed Josh Hutcherson's portrayal of Peeta. I believed the emotions being portrayed by the character. I believed when he was in love, angry sad etc Overall every person did a great job portraying their characters. The style of acting was good also. It went well with the film. They did not act like they were bored as a way to convey sadness. The actors really conveyed the sadness the characters were supposed to feel.I also loved the cinematography used in the film. I thought when the camera shook really went well with the moments it was apart of. It heightened the sense of restlessness, hopelessness and chaos. It stuck with the movies theme of sacrifice, hopelessness and the need people have to survive. I loved when this particular use of the camera was used during moments of running because it really immersed me in the film. It made you feel like you were apart of the moment. The use of that type of cinematography also went well with fighting scenes in the movie, it really heightened the chaos that was going on in the scene. It also made the scenes more dramatic which is a good thing in a movie like this.Overall I really enjoyed the movie. I've already seen it like three times and I would definitely watch it again. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 12 because they might not be able to handle violence, but I recommend this movie to anyone who likes action drama and a little romance. Also to anyone who has read the series of books. They really keep true to the story except for a few changes, but the movie was great without them. ""The Hunger Games"" is a great movie that brought tears to my eyes and kept me at the edge of my seat. I truly enjoyed it, and I hope that more people see it because it is a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One for the arrow,"An adaptation of a book that is popular with teenagers and my daughter pestering me to take her to the cinema to watch the movie. Its Twilight all over again I thought.However The Hunger Games features youngsters in a dystopian future where in the name of peace an annual event is held where selected kids between the ages of 12 to 18 years of age have to fight to the death until the last one standing is declared the victor.Jennifer Lawrence is Katniss who takes the place of her younger sister. Woody Harrelson is the former winner from her sector who teaches her and the male participant from the same sector, Peeta. Harrelson seems not to care and is a drunk but as the film goes on shows perceptive insights as he lobbies on behalf of both the participants as well as training them on how to survive.The film is a mish mash of various themed films such as Battle Royale, Rollerball, The Running Man, Westworld, The Truman Show.Its entertaining but in a daft way. The young actors give it their all, Lawrence shows why she is one of the best young actors out there. However what kind of society which televises this tribute called The Hunger Games thinks its fair that a 12 year old can go up against a 18 year old? Never mind that the viewing public has such a blood lust to watch televised murder on screen when its clear during the selection process that the public are not happy that their children could be selected to participate in the games.The film is also overlong, it is sanitized enough to keep its teen audience happy without the violence being too visceral. Its surprisingly enjoyable but adults are likely to be more discerning than a younger audience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I've Read the Books, This Hits the Spot OK","I finished all three books a couple of weeks ago, so they were pretty fresh in my mind when I saw this movie at the cinema. While it is not a perfect adaption of the first book by any means, if you have not read the books you will still be entertained and dare I say it be less critical of the things that were left out.Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is pretty much as I pictured her while reading the books, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was solid and here I am a bit critical of too much being left out for his character. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch was nicely done and he fit my image of him from the books, again I am a bit critical of too much being left out for his character as well. Liam Hemsworth was terrible as Gale, not totally his fault though, another character with way too much cut from the book, not that I cared too much, I didn't have much time for him throughout the series.A few reviewers, or more than a few compared this to Battle Royale. I can see where they are coming from, but this not comparable, they are not the same. OK fine they both involve teenagers fighting to the death, but that is where the comparison ends for me. Battle Royale is in a class of its own and has a story of it's own, this movie should not be compared to it.I am not a teenager, but I went to see this with my teenage daughter and we both enjoyed it and thought it was money well spent for 2 hours of entertainment. I would have liked to see it quite a bit longer just to do the book justice, but I can see that when catering to the teenage market movies have to be cut short. Or do they? Hopefully there will be an extended version ala Avatar, which explained so much more than the theatrical cut.7 out of 10 for me, I would have given it an 8 or a 9 if it had kept more of the depth from the book. Looking forward to the next one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Paper thin and watered down,"The trouble with this movie is that I'm old enough to have seen many of its antecedents. So before The Truman Show, which is essentially the same idea as The Hunger Games, we have Battle Royale, The Running Man and of course, Rollerball. They all deal with mass entertainment in a dystopian future society and they all have their flaws. What's really disappointing about The Hunger Games is that unless you've read the book, the film will give you only a fleeting glimpse into why the games are called that. There's nothing else to help the naive reader make sense of the plot and because of this, the involvement of children will seem a bit odd to anyone who hasn't read the book. In fact, that's something you should take into account when reading many of the reviews of the film as they're written by people who have read the books and can fill in the wide gaps in the film without even thinking about it. Some have said its plot line is mildy satirical, but in my view that's just an excuse for a poorly filleted and disappointing adaptation of a marvellous book.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
American film.... what happened,"I read the book years ago and loved it. Now after watching the film I am certainly disappointed. This film is a cookie cutter thriller at best. Save your money and don't watch this; just read the book. The film is similar to the Alice and wonderlands most recent adaptation; the visuals are great, but the story is butchered. I mean love is nice, yet I find myself more entertained by the notion of it when its focus is more than skin deep. Yet, there is no love put into this film it is entirely focused on entertaining your peripheral and lacks substance in dialogue and explanation as well as some of the story being altered in presentation from a book to movie. This may have to do with having a pg-13 rating. I am sure Ms.Collins is more disappointed with the out come than I. Just don't bother disappointing yourself and stay home when you find the urge to see this in theaters.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An action packed movie you won't want to miss!!,"First of all, let me just say that this is really the review that makes sense. I don't see how this film can have some such low ratings.

Surprisingly, it didn't seem to go on for 2 hours 22 minutes. The acting was great and believable for all the characters. This film was... different,in a good way, to other films with reasons like the camera angles and effects. There's nothing much more to say except you'll be sorry if you miss this cinematic experience and that this film definitely deserves a 9/10!

Thumbs-down on shaky-cam,"Directors who film using shaky-cam should be taken out and publicly horsewhipped. There is a reason steady-cam was invented, you morons!!I would have given this movie a 10 if it weren't for the fact that I couldn't watch half of it. I had to look at the back of the seat in front of me during the shaky-cam scenes, and of course, those were the best ones. As far as I could tell from what I could watch and from the dialog, the movie is quite true to the novel and the acting is very good. The scenery is quite lovely, as well - turns out it was shot in North Carolina, which means that's Appalachian country.Did I mention the director should be flogged for using shaky-cam?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Well-Done,"When I went to see this movie, I was only halfway through the book after only starting it the day before. The book was so good (of what I had read of it at the time) that I was impatient to see the movie, especially with all of the notice it was getting.Getting ready to see this movie, I had taken a couple of things into consideration: it was an action and partial teen-romance book. One big thing I notice in movies, while I'm watching them, is the music. This movie being the two genres I mentioned, I expected the music to either be epic (like Pirates of the Caribbean, LOTR, etc.) or very teen- oriented (band-based songs). It was, mostly, neither. The musical score let me down, and the main song that I had fallen in love with (""Safe and Sound"") wasn't actually in the movie.However, many other things were done right. The graphics and camera shots were AMAZING. In one scene, the contestants are let loose into the arena, and the film goes relatively silent. This in itself portrays how easily your ears can fuzz-out when you are experiencing an adrenaline rush. I applaud the use of that tactic in this movie.Also, when I saw Katniss's dress as compared to how the book described it, I was briefly disappointed. The book mentioned that it was supposed to look fiery, and as the scene continued, I saw nothing. Then, she stood up and twirled around--and the hem of her dress burst to flames! I was amazed. And one of the most beautiful shots was when they were in the chariot with their capes ignited. Many scenes/shots in this movie are gorgeous and worthy of being stills.Honestly, when I imagined all of the violence that took place in the book, I was afraid of how thoroughly depressing it would be to see children killing each other in a battle to survive. Though it was sad, the movie was filmed to shield eyes from the worst of what happened, which I am grateful for.Overall, since this review has gone on for far too long, I give this movie an 7. Watching this movie without reading the books is hard, but well-done to be sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A movie reminiscence of mankind's dark history,"Eerie reminiscence of the mankind's dark, psychopathic past (the Greek Minotaur, the roman's gladiators and the island of Capri, and most recently the drafting of youths into the Vietnam conflict) this movie takes place in the future where society pits male and female youths (a total of 24) selected from 12 districts against one another in a compelling, lethal cocktail of hide and seek, and musical chairs. This movie, like 1984, reflects man's insecurities whereby in the future, he gave up his power and control to the state in exchange for a state managed society. Subconsciously, this movie particularly strikes home to the males of the Vietnam generation who were selected to enter the war games in the jungles of Vietnam when they came of age (and later when it became a lottery system) much like the characters in the movie. And like in the movie, much of the battles in that war were filmed and televised.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good--But Could Have Been Much Better,"Out of the loins of Suzanne Collins comes a movie that bit off more than it could chew. Despite the movie's multiple setbacks, however, the world that Collins created is utterly frightening and eerily familiar. As the hype for this movie increased in recent weeks, the headlines informed non-fans of the basic storyline: kids killing kids. The movie itself—although not shying away from death—allowed it to encompass so much more.The core of this movie stands on the shoulders of Jennifer Lawrence. I've thought hard and cannot honestly think of a better Katniss Everdeen. Her complicated character has to pull off a ""Is this really happening"" look for nearly 40 minutes of screen time. She does it beautifully. Behind her—everyone from Donald Sutherland to the girl who plays Primrose—is a cast that holds its own weight (I'm still unsure about Gale—but that will be decided in Catching Fire).The main problems with this film derive from the Director—Gary Ross. Although this director is talented, he has never taken on a project of this size. That much is obvious. From the very start you will see the amateur mistakes—from very poor editing to unfocused shots. The camera moved so much during the action scenes when a simple wide angle would have had more impact on the audience. Hopefully he'll have a handle on it by the second or third film.As a fan, I feel a must attest to how the movie plays out compared to the book. I was quite surprised how well the movie followed the book. There were things that had to be cut out—the Mockingjay pin coming from the mayor's daughter or eyes of the creatures at the end. Other than that, few changes were made. One problem the audience (and I) was clearly unhappy about was the symbol of the revolution being used in the first half hour of the first movie.If you are a fan of the books, you should have seen it at midnight. If you haven't seen it, go see it now. If you are not a fan of the series, I have only one thing to say to you: go read the books. This movie is good, but the books will blow you away. If you are not much of a reader, this movie is still worth your time. It holds its own and will (mostly) make sense. As a fan of the series, I expected morebut was not disappointed.reillyreviews.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"In future North America, the rulers of America annually pick 24 boys and girls from each district to fight to the death. This is the story of a girl who replaced her sister.","This movie was great. People put five stars for this movie, millions of people decided to read and watch the movie of The Hunger Games, and it was as great as it promised to be. This movie was based on the book by Suzanne Collins. However, this movie didn't completely follow the book. Some parts of the book were either discarded or replaced. Even though the movie did this, it was even better than the book itself. I do however warn all people who go to see this movie. Warning: There are no scary or disturbing images, but there are very scary parts in the movie where a person will die in a very cruel manner. But besides this the movie is awesome, and deserves all the wonderful praise it can get. There was no cussing at all, and there was no use of strong language either. Never underestimate the wonderful things of The Hunger Games. Another warning though, this is not for young children. There are moments of violence, and as I said before, very scary moments. There are also a small handful of sad parts. I prefer this movie for anyone ten years old or higher. Anyway this is a wonderful movie, and I hope that the sequel, Catching Fire, will come out in theaters soon. Can not wait to get on DVD.

"Good, But Several Flaws","The big screen adaption of the Hunger Games was good, but could have been better. As weird as this may sound, it could have been more violent. I know that they have to cater towards their demographic (pre-teens), but I felt that the way the violence was portrayed in the movie didn't give it the same sense of peril and intensity as the book. I'm not saying it need to be gorier, but there definitely could have been a bit more raw. There were also some character development issues. The Katniss-Gale relationship is never completely explained. Also, the Katniss-Peeta dynamic was not developed fully enough for the audience to get a clear picture of Katniss' true feelings (as stated in the book). Overall, the movie is good. It is definitely worth seeing and will make you laugh, cry and jump out of your seat.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Battle Royale with cheese,"In a cinematic world of re-makes, re-imaginings and full-blown copies, it's inevitable to see a movie like The Hunger Games wallow in the limelight and hysteria of mainstream banality and post-Potter hunger simply because it's there. Adapted from Suzanne Collins' trilogy of teen- friendly novels, The Hunger Games looks set to follow in the well-off footsteps of Harry Potter and the soon-to-cease Twilight as the next big-money, low-brow saga for the GCSE bound masses.This moderately engaging adaptation of Collins' first novel plays like a pre-teen spin on Battle Royale. Director Gary Ross shoots for a futurist-retro sense of uprising, endurance and wonder and in the eyes and minds of 11 year-olds, he's on target. There's plenty to behold, but little to absorb. Despite all efforts, The Hunger Games is starved of a character or scenario to really care about.A hyped-up, cheesy and dumbed down treatise on human nature, spirit, freedom and TV culture, this is a badly-acted, action-crammed movie built on a much explored prophecy that's been residing in both literature and film for years; a nightmare dystopia in which society is slave to a tyrannical regime. But what do you know; there's a rebellion on the cards. And guess what? It's only lead by an unlikely yet inspiring hero. The Hunger Games is nothing new, then, but hold your horses; pitting 24 kids against one another in a game of death on a top-secret island is an original idea that's sure to evoke sympathy, shock and compassion. Isn't it? Well, maybe, but not if you know your films; not if you've seen Battle Royale.A bloody slice of social satire with shock and awe to spare, Battle Royale was by no means the first to offer up a glimpse into an oppressive fictional world where people are forced to fight to the death. Sparticus, Running Man and even Gladiator all touched upon on this idea of enslaved cock-fighting for the ""greater good"" and fun of a bent society.Suzanne Collins' tale may not be a rip-off of Battle Royale, but it is a blatant source. In director Ross' big screen retooling, The Hunger Games is set in a far from terrifying, post-war America whose totalitarian government get their kicks from a legislation born out of the ashes of World War III; each of the country's 12 districts are to offer up one young girl and boy every year to slog it out on live TV in a last-kid-standing tournament set on a virtual island. This; a sacrificial homage to a nation's thirst for blood and conflict. A punishment for an early, post war rebellion. A tribute to state power; The Hunger Games.The film follows Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), a steadfast teen who puts her life on the line when she volunteers to replace her younger sister in the upcoming games. What follows is a predictable tale of heroism and self-sacrifice as Katniss and clunky love interest Peeta (a wooden Josh Hutcherson) are wined, dined, trained and then hurled into a giant lion's den full of determined, blood-thirsty brats who are there to win, to kill. Will Katniss and Peeta fall in love? Will they both make it out alive? If not, will one of them be the victor? Do you care?The Hunger Games is a self-assured, self-important piece of profit-reaping cinema whose potentially bleak and barbaric set-up cannot be realised through on screen peril, atmosphere, gore and violence due to its mild target audience. Alas, there is a lot of hand-held camera-work and rapid editing to cover up the scuffles, scraps, impact and blood. It doesn't work. Over-hyped and overdone; turns out it doesn't take much to tailor a totalitarian future concept for the modern-day youths; just strip it of all depth, complexity and darkness, throw in some weapons, some fire, a bit of romance and some heartthrobs and you'll be laughing all the way to the bank.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"That which is old, is new again.","I guess I'm just not in sync with popular teenage culture, because I kind of liked this film, but, based on the number of negative user reviews, you'd think everyone would have dismissed this thing as the next ""Gili"". Well, it is a teenage action adventure romp that skews female, so there's bound to be some disappointment among young male audience members.But, to the film. One wonders if Miss Collins, author of the series, ever read Frederic Brown, or watched classic Star Trek in the late 1960s or during its syndication run in the 70s and 80s, because the basic bulk of the story is taken right out of ""Arena"" (which also saw reincarnation via an issue of ""Adam Strange"" in Detective Comics). Which is okay, because it's not a clone of the story, but uses the basic plot and story written by Brown, and adds many young person and female flourishes to comment on contemporary TV watching habits, and societies' imperilment of becoming addicted to a certain type of bloodletting entertainment.The film is nicely paced, and seems to be riding a fine line of trying to be edgy, real, and young person's fair all at the same time. I think it achieves this for the bulk of the audience whose dollars they're trying to capture, but the rough and tumble sci-fi gamer who is used to blood and gore via an online gaming server (and I'm talking pre-teen boys here) might probably get little impatient with it. But, the young ladies in tonight's audience, seemed to really connect with the film.Some critiques here; in the original ""Arena"" we had Captain James T. Kirk pitted against a very fake looking intelligent lizard-captain, with the goal being for said starship captains to finish each other off in a ""more civil"" manner, as opposed to creating a mess in space via starship combat. In ""Hunger Games"" the main characters must fight for a dystopic world, again to avoid a messy war. And that's my biggest critique; the backstory, and the setting; because I didn't get a whole lot of logic to what exactly the Hunger Games represented. There seemed to be some kind of starvation component, but it really wasn't made clear in the film, just inferred that food might be in short supply. Yet one was hard pressed to see starving citizens, and with such lush green forests, one wonders why crops aren't planted to feed the people if food is indeed in such short supply. But, that's kind of the premise of the film, so you have to buy into it to really enjoy the film itself. This verse Kirk and the Gorn who were fighting over territory.There's some symbolism going on in here. There's a hearkening back to ancient Greek heroes and gods, as well as an Asmodeus like TV producer calling the shots for the Hunger Games. Woody ""let me tie up traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge some 12 years ago"" Harrelson makes an appearance as an aged vet of the games (as I digress bitterly), who relays what wisdom and beneficence that he can to the selected champions of his district.There's romance, there's intrigue, there's hand to hand combat, there's MTV like shaky-cam cinematography, some girlish moments, and even some pyrotechnics (a rarity for any film). In the original ""Arena"", or rather the Star Trek adaptation of Frederic Brown's short story, Shatner gave another sterling speech at the end to the Metrons who had been pulling his strings the entire time. ""Hunger Games"" does the same thing, only more cinematically, and, unlike my beloved Star Trek, does it with a female bent. Which is better, or which do I prefer? I'm not really sure. Being a starship and phaser kind of guy, you'd think I would lean towards Kirk and crew, but I think I kind of like Katniss's challenge at the end. Kirk uses a Prometheus like solution, where Katniss sticks true to Artemis' ways, even to her ultimate act of defiance to the TV producers and audience. I would ask anybody who reads this to watch Star Trek's ""Arena"", and compare Kirk yelling up at the sky near the end of the episode with Katniss's gesture and solution.Technical notes; the editing is slow (thank goodness), and there're few jump cuts, which makes watching this film easy on the eyes. No digital cinematography here. This is pure film making. The costumes were interesting, and the makeup fell into the same category; trying to look appealing to young audiences while at the same time being edgy and flashy. All in all respectably shot.Not a super sterling film, but, using recycled material from a variety of sci-fi sources, with a gripping narrative, and polishing the package with a pink female bow, makes the film an interesting watch.Check it out.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Nutshell Review: The Hunger Games,"I have to admit at first glance, going by the trailers that have been incessantly playing since late last year, that this was nothing more than a Battle Royale rip off, having teenagers put into an arena and fighting to the death. Such genre films have been done countless of time, from the days of Schwarzeneggar in his The Running Man, to even Stone Cold Steve Austin in The Condemned, where everyone becomes gladiators and essentially television content fodder, and The Hunger Games surely contained the exact same elements too. But what excelled and stood this film from its peers, boils back to Collins' superbly set up story, and in Gary Ross' focused direction that never leaves the film soulless, filling it with plenty of heart and got the audience to emotionally invest in its protagonist from the get go.And that is something Gary Ross, going by his filmography such as Seabiscuit and Pleasantville, does quite effortlessly, with a story that's set in a fictional period where much of the known world is divided into districts to suppress an uprising decades ago, where each district, living in hunger and in fear, have to cough out a teenage boy and girl each between the ages of 12 to 18 every year as tribute to battle in The Hunger Games, a fight to the last, that is also broadcast live in a television show. The arena is at The Capitol where the elites live amongst armed protection, and the combatants duke it out in an arena of faux pas natural habitat that can be manipulated at will by designers.What set this out from the rest is that it has a female protagonist who is not a useless, or whining damsel in distress. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a hunter and provider for her family, volunteering as tribute in place of her sister Primrose (Willow Shields), and together with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), they become the tributes from District 12. We spend the first hour unhurried in painting the background set for the entire trilogy, so much so that not everything got explained, which was a sly move to leave out unessential details at this point for the other sequels to follow up on, especially the need to know more about the current state of the world. We're left to concentrate on a series of unfolding events around Katniss, as well as to get to know the reclusive girl who has to learn how to milk her popularity to increase her chances of survival.While it's essentially Battle Royale, there are the necessary tweaks to the rules of the game to keep it unique, such as the introduction of sponsors and external assistance. Katniss also had to rely on a lot of luck, and isn't your superhero Rambo from the onset, making her believable, identifiable, and with qualities in a character that you would root for. Even her skill with the bow doesn't make her a deadly shot all the time, as things like anxiety and fear make her character all the more believable, and human. Pacing was kept just right especially after the hour mark when the games kick into gear, although one complaint will be that since this is a teenage flick, you do not get to see the gory details of teen killing teen, no thanks to the deliberate cinematography to keep thing shaky, out of focus and never within comfortable depth of field. After all, this is supposed to be PG-13 stuff for the mass market, so everything's kept at a level that Walt Disney himself will approve.Still, it's not about the violence and the deaths, but a lot more about the theme of survival, with the story going a lot more for collaboration and cooperation, even amongst allies and alliances formed amongst the strong to pick on the meek. Subplots included in the film all hint at stories that the next two installments will pick up on, such as Katniss' growing popularity amongst the districts and her becoming the icon of rebellion that you'd know will be dealt with even without reading the books. Romance also finds time to creep into the storyline, especially since an engineered one starts to become a little bit more real, and setting up an uncomplicated love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and the former's best friend in Gale (Liam Hemsworth) who had sworn to protect and provide for her family while she's away competing to return home.And the supporting ensemble cast consists of notables such as Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz and Woody Harrelson as pro-Katniss supporters, or at least those who have to stand at her corner during her preparation for the Games, and others such as Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones as television personalities, Wes Bentley as the primary gamemaster, and Donald Sutherland as President Snow, everyone veterans in their own right propping up the relative newcomers who take on primary roles in this expected franchise. Amongst those who stood out are Banks, almost unrecognizable in her makeup and costumes, and Tucci who hams it up as a television host.The Hunger Games have got me hooked despite getting off on the wrong footing during its marketing, and I am as eager as many new found fans out there who are anticipating what's next in the story. It may be tame, but Katniss is a fresh female protagonist who will have you hooked to her cause, and that alone is this film's strength that it played up superbly.

As good as it can get,"I read the books and absolutely loved them. When I saw the trailers for the movie, I got excited--I wanted to curb my excitement, though, and I'm glad I did. A word to anyone who read the books and wants to see the movie: the movie is NEVER as good. Keep that in mind.However, this movie did a really good job of keeping the key components of the story in the movie and trying to explain them the best they could: I could only find about six small things that they changed from the book, which is amazing as far as book adaptations go. You have to realize, though--there's no way they can have the whole book in one two-hour movie.So many people are complaining that the book was so vivid and so detailed. If you want a close to probably four hour movie or have it broken into two parts (which I'm sure everyone would hate as well), then be my guest. But honestly, if you just read the books, the movie is astounding.There were minute details in the book that Collins spent chapters writing. And guess what? No physical action actually happened. So many thoughts and emotions that were drawn out in the book had to be broken down to a ten-second close-up on Jennifer Lawrence. There was simply no other way to do it . . . unless, of course, the whole movie was narrated or Katniss talked to herself incessantly (far worse alternatives in my opinion).But enough about the adaptation. I was kind of thrown by some of the casting choices for awhile, but they did not disappoint. Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Lenny Kravitz did so well--Hutcherson in particular. I really liked the costumes for the Games themselves and the Capitol people. The District 12 costumes were bland and kind of ugly, but they were supposed to be, so no complaints there. The Arena was exactly how I pictured it.Pretty much the only thing I didn't like about this movie was the camera work. The camera never stopped moving. I understand that it's an action movie, but we don't have to have action when everyone is just sitting around and talking. I really wish the director wouldn't have gone for that style. i don't know very many people who actually like it.Another thing that I think they could have done to make the movie more enjoyable was to add in some more ""down time""--everything is super intense the whole movie, and it would have been nice to have a breather here and there. It worked how it was, but I think I would have liked it a little more.All in all, this was a great adaptation from the book. But it's just that--an adaptation. If you haven't read the books, you're probably going to be confused and think it's a really shallow movie. If you have read the books, you can fill in the blanks for all their thoughts and the deeper meaning to it--just enjoy the Hunger Games coming to life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hunger Games,"In this adventurous thriller Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) embark on a dangerous journey. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time.You never know what is going to happen next. From violence, to love stories brewing, it's sure to keep your focus.

The Hunger Games Review,"In what was once North America, the Capitol of Panem maintains its hold on its 12 districts by forcing them each to select a boy and a girl, called Tributes, to compete in a nationally televised event called the Hunger Games. Every citizen must watch as the youths fight to the death until only one remains. District 12 Tribute Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has little to rely on, other than her hunting skills and sharp instincts, in an arena where she must weigh survival against love.So I didn't see any of the movies or read any of the books but I am still aware of the series and all of its three (and almost four) films so far. I think I must have been the only one who hasn't yet. It's human nature for things in this first film to not seem as climactic when you've previously known things about films past and future. This review will be based on this.This film took place in what seems like some dystopian future but we never really got an explanation about how this world came to be. We start off by seeing Katniss (Lawrence) trying to hunt for food for her family including her mother (Paula Malcomson) and her sister (Willow Shields) (they mentioned a father but I'm not sure how he died). Her family appears to be poor and the residents of each District appear to be poor as well. She lives in District 12 with her friends Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Her life soon gets interrupted when her sister gets selected as a tribute (participant) in this year's annual Hunger Games, a televised event where male and female youth from each district are selected at random to fight to the death (that's why these are YA novels). They don't really explain why this is the case but the explanation we do get just seemed silly to me. When her sister gets selected as a tribute, Katniss volunteers to compete in her place. Her friend Peeta gets selected as well. So the majority of the film after that is just her and Peeta being introduced to this world and preparing themselves to compete in these Hunger Games. These two get assistance with this from Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), and Cinna (Lenny Kravitz). Once they finally do get to compete (it took a while to get to this point), they must face the elements, the landscape, and the other participants. The actual Hunger Games itself was quite a letdown when it was something that had to potential to be exciting (the subject matter as far as I've heard had ""R"" level violence but was watered down to cater to a wider PG-13 audience). I found the violence to be quite muted and infrequent as most of the killing was offscreen and implied. But a film/book called ""The Hunger Games"" isn't necessarily about the games itself but it was about Katniss and Peeta having to stick together and survive the games. The second half of the film serves to further develop the friendship/relationship between the two teens. This worked as the acting of Lawrence and Hutcherson were good here as well as Harrelson, Banks, and Kravitz (surprisingly). Despite finding the story to be very silly, I found the film was shot very beautifully. I cannot speak to its authenticity but it did a good job depicting a dystopian world. Overall. this is a decent, big-world film but I just couldn't get into it as I probably should because I did not like the story. I can, however, understand why people just ate this up.Score: 7/10 keithlovesmovies.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Disturbing Settings of Panem: Exploring Oppression, Extravagance, and Survival","I want to criticize the disturbing settings in The Hunger Games movie. These settings reflect what literary scholar calls a ""speculative dystopia,"" where the exaggerated inequalities and oppressive structures in the story mirror potential extremes in our own society (Atwood, 2011). From the poverty-stricken District 12 to the rich and flashy Capitol, and the dangerous arena where the Hunger Games take place, these settings highlight the inequality and cruelty in this society. These places also show the flaws and harsh realities of Panem. The setting of the movie really gives a vibe of oppression, extravagance, and survival.I am shocked by the oppressive vibe created by the setting of District 12. The district is shown as a poor, hopeless place where people struggle just to survive. The setting looks bleak, with run-down houses and dangerous coal mines. The people of District 12 are not only poor but also controlled by the Capitol, which keeps them stuck in a cycle of hardship. They work hard in the mines but get very little in return. The daily struggles in District 12 highlight how its residents live in constant fear and uncertainty, with no hope for a better life. This deep unfairness contrasts sharply with the Capitol, where people live in comfort and power.Also, I am disturbed by the extravagant lifestyle of the Capitol, which is a world of excess and waste. The Capitol is filled with bright colors, strange clothes, and huge buildings. Its citizens live in luxury, throwing big parties and enjoying things the people in the districts could only dream of. While the districts struggle to survive, the Capitol spends money on extravagant clothes and parties. This shows the inequality in Panem and the selfishness of the Capitol's citizens, who enjoy their power without caring about the suffering of others. The Capitol's wealth and excess reveal how the rich keep their power by ignoring the poor, creating a divide that is hard to ignore.Furthermore, I am shocked by the survival vibes that the arena has. The arena is another setting designed to shock and disturb. At first glance, it looks like a peaceful place with forests, lakes, and open spaces, but it is actually a deadly trap. The environment is controlled by the Capitol, which puts tributes through dangerous situations for the entertainment of its citizens. Survival in the arena is not just about fighting other tributes but also about avoiding traps, firestorms, and deadly animals. The arena forces tributes to fight to the death, highlighting the Capitol's control over their lives. It serves as a reminder of how far the Capitol will go to maintain control and turn survival into a game.Through these settings, The Hunger Games highlights the oppression, extravagance, and survival that define the world of Panem. District 12 shows the struggles of the oppressed, the Capitol reveals the wastefulness of the rich, and the arena forces tributes into a deadly game controlled by the Capitol. These settings represent the unfairness and cruelty in the world of The Hunger Games.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's a pretty good adaptation.,"Katniss Everdeen agrees to take up her sister's place in the deadly Hunger Games, a sacrificial game which puts youngsters from different districts against one another, there can only be one survivor.I wanted to read the book before watching the film, and reviewing it, and I know I'm a little late to the party, but I quite enjoyed it.It's a fairly hyped up film, and I'm not surprised that another sequel is set to land in cinemas soon.I think it's a little slow to start, but it gets better as soon as Katniss enters the games, it definitely gets more action packed and moves at a quicker pace.There's a definite social message here, it takes aim at a society that's desperate for thrills and spills, one that enjoys the suffering of others.Sets and costumes look pretty great, pretty much as I imagine from the books, very stylish, and a whole new world is conceived, and looks pretty good.The standout aspect for me is Jennifer Lawrence, she stands tall among a very strong cast.A good debut movie.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolute rubbish!,"If anything, this movie shows the power of well thought and carefully planned marketing campaign that moved masses to see this crap. They hype around the movie is unbelievable, but it only matched by incredible shallowness of the movie itself. No characters development, the characters are flat and one dimensional. It is even hard to root for any of them. Acting is non-existent. Story is boring and full of clichés. It is like a toxic Hollywood's brew for teens: grab some book that has potential for sequels, make half-arse baked screen play, threw in attractive actress for boyz, and two hunks for lonely teenage girls.

Overrated unfortunately,"Having read all three books, and finding the story was fantastic, I was hoping for an amazing movie production, bringing the 1st chapter of Suzanne Collins trilogy to a fantastic start...... Unfortuanately I was to be disappointed, the movie had missed out many key points, and in some areas they where completely changed, making it difficult to understand - even for someone who has read the books. Another unfortunate element to the movie was the acting. In some areas there was special points when I really felt how they where feeling, but most of the time I could not connect with them, making the film less enjoyable. The idea of reducing the rating to a 12A and editing out elements that would of expressed the classic story that the author wrote. Overall the film was very plain, dare I say ""boring"", leaving me wondering what all the hype was over.All in all, I would say this is a film to perhaps wait till it comes out on DVD, and not one to waist a night out on.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as violent as it should be,"I finished reading The Hunger Games book trilogy three weeks before the Egyptian Revolution. Seeing what happened during the 18 days was like watching Suzanne Collins' books on screen. Until today, more than a year after the revolution, I believe The Hunger Games remains the closest work of fiction to the events of the revolution in Egypt. After all, it's about a game that the Capitol of Panem has started after the people made an uprising against it. The Hunger Games has 24 tributes but only one can win and that's by surviving.Violence, thus, is the keyword. It's the core of the world created by Suzanne Collins who mentioned in an interview that she got the idea of the books while watching footage of the US crimes in Iraq. On the other hand, Gary Ross's film adaptation did not survive the gleam of Hollywood. The result is unnecessary scenes of romance (which filled the theatre with giggles at its silliness) at the expense of core violent scenes, all for the sake of topping the box office.Despite that, most of the performances were excellent. When fans of the book trilogy (me included) made their disagreement clear when she was first cast, Jennifer Lawrence replied that she will do her best, playing Katniss Everdeen. And she did. When it comes to other leading characters, Josh Hutcherson is no less good, though there should have been much focus on the character of Haymitch and the humorous side of it as well as the relationship he developed with Katniss and Peeta.Of course it couldn't all fit in 2 hours and 8 minutes. However, this is no justification for the film's clear means to win the war to the top of the box office. But, in the end, the first book is my least favourite. The best is yet to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great if you've read the books,"I must say I've read the books and I loved this movie. It is two and a half hours that goes by in the blink of an eye.

If, however, you haven't read it, you won't like it as much. There are many things (won't get into specifics) that go unexplained or under-explained; stuff that is explained through the first person point of view in the book just can't be explained as thoroughly in the movie. If you've read the book, you know everything and you're a bystander watching the events unfold without the extra Katniss commentary. If you haven't read it, you will probably have a lot of questions.

hmmm.... poor adaption.,"I found the Hunger Games to be a great movie, but i am not impressed with the adaption from the book! the book was defiantly the better of the two!! The movie has missed out a lot, such as peeta's fake leg, the origin of the mocking bird pin changed, the spear not being removed from rue... changed. It also used a slightly blurred clip for the bloodbath at the beginning of the actual games, so it didn't give you the intensity like the book did!!

Powerful. Realistic. Honest.,"The Hunger Games is seriously powerful. This movie has officially changed my life. Yes I am a fan of the books also, but the movie has changed my perspective in lots of things.

I might be according to some people, but I have not experience any film that effects me this much for a long time. This is inspirational and powerful. Yes I used the word powerful again, because it's true. There is not a single moment where I felt it was flawed, not that it's perfect and everyone will love it, but it's perfect in its own way. The actors are unforgettable, Jennifer Lawrence's performance will haunt me forever, in a good way of course. Through the whole movie, I cried, I laughed, I bite my nails and sit on the edge of my seat. Once again, it's powerful, so powerful it can literally change lives, mine for example and I know a lot more people will be like me.

"Good, because we've seen it already, otherwise it'd be great!","OK, There was a potential 9 out of 10 here, but because I had a déjà vu feeling the entire movie I had to make it a 7. Which is still pretty good. First things first, Hunger games. I haven't read the books and tried to not let myself get ""captured"" by the hype, as it mostly works negatively rather than positively imo. But the basic premise of the story, already dampened my anxiety. Drop people in a cage and the sole survivor wins. Battle royal anyone?? Don't know why no one made this comparison, because it's exactly the same...OK, I'll admit that this movie has more depth... but you can't deny that the killin' in battle was more awesome. Anywho, it's been done before basically. Also, the feeling of oppression, the underdog, the poor ghetto districts vs the rich and famous,... almost everything felt really familiar. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it isn't good either. Another thing was the shaky camera in the beginning...Don't know the meaning of this, because normally you start a scene with a wide shot and then, you do the close-up etc. You don't shake your way through everything, hoping the audience feels like it's 'into' the movie more. The entire beginning up until the reaping was just one long headache to me. What I did like was the heartfelt acting involved. Have to give it up for the casting department here, because (almost) everyone was perfect. My only casting criticism was our president snow or what's he called? Mr. Donald Sutherland. Very fine actor, but what was he doing in here?? Looked like he was about the fall asleep. Which saddens me, because he got a good surrounding cast to work with. Give it up for Jennifer Lawrence who gives the performance of a lifetime. My favorite movie moment was a certain burial scene when the games are well on their way, and afterwards she gives their district's salute to the entire world, and by doing so, give the nudge to her people to fight for their own. Wow, I was just mesmerized by that.OK, the guys involved..Hutchersons, Ludwig and Hemsworth are also very fine actors and hold their own. I was even fine with Woody Harrelson, and that's saying something!!I hope that this movie get's the praise it deserves, as it is soooo much better than a certain other book/movie franchise that's going around, intended for the same age group....Here's hoping for 2 more movies and here's looking at Jennifer Lawrence!Raf",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Entertaining but shallow & you'll need to have read the book to fill in the gaps.,"Late last year I was handed a free book at the cinema as part of a promotion. I read the back, dismissed it as a teen book and plonked it on the bookcase for a day of lazy reading sometime in the future. A couple of weeks ago I saw the trailer for The Hunger Games and dismissed it as a watered down, sanitized version of Battle Royale. Then I noticed the logo and recognized it from the afore mentioned book. Intrigued, I set aside an hour that Sunday to read the first couple of chapters to see if it would be worth watching the film and promptly devoured the book in a single sitting.Whilst it will never go down in history as a literary classic and will be forgotten in twenty years, unlike the Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter volumes, The Hunger Games trilogy is a stomping good read and perfectly fits the overused cliché of 'page-turner.' Though a couple of hundred pages away from the end, I'm loving it. It's easy, gripping, highly entertaining, disposable fun. That said, I've read Catch 22 more times than I have fingers on one-and-a-half hands and look what they did to that on film. And Captain Corelli's Mandolin. And For those without a clue, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are selected for the Hunger Games, a barbaric, televised show in which 'Tributes' are taken from each of twelve districts of a futuristic, dystopian America (now known as Panem) to enter a vast, synthetic arena and kill each other until only one remains. There's more to it than that but if you're familiar with the likes of Battle Royale, Rollerball and The Running Man you'll know where it's heading.So, what did they do to The Hunger Games? Well, they cut it. They had to, because it would have been at least a four hour film. Being written largely in the first person, there were no subplots with peripheral characters to excise and so the editing had to come through losing detail with the result that the film lacks depth. I took a friend who hadn't read the books and afterwards I needed to explain some of the exchanged glances between protagonists Katniss and Peeta and fill in the gaps for him. Gary Ross has directed it with the aim of satisfying the vast army of readers whilst hoping not to ostracize those who enter the cinema without background knowledge of the film. Unfortunately he doesn't quite satisfy either camp.Katniss' thoughts, the reason we understand and identify with her so completely, have been lost. Her relationships with both Peeta and her lifelong friend, Gale, are shallow and we are not given enough time with their team in the Capitol to really appreciate the mind games, the relationships and the characters. This is a rare example when a film just shy of two-and-a-half hours needs to be at least thirty minutes longer! Too much is compressed and it feels choked of the life that flowed rapidly through the book. From the film I don't know much about Katniss and couldn't warm to her while, in the book, she is flawed, driven, angry, hopeful and a multi-faceted character I both liked and could respect.The 'game' is all too brief. We actually see very little of the killing and know comparatively little of the battles between the twenty-four adolescents that must dwindle to one. The violence has been virtually eradicated to the point where only a Daily Mail reader could be shocked and the beasts in the final act are completely wasted and the reason for them all but lost in clumsy CGI not at all befitting the $78m budget. More frustrating is the complete redesign of the cornucopia in the arena that is very pointedly described as gold throughout the books and conjures an image of a vast, ornate horn. Instead it more closely resembles an unpainted, bastardized Batmobile stolen from Christian Bale.Is it as good as Battle Royale? Hmmm, probably not in the case of the film. But, particularly with the book, it's different and equally as valid. See the film. It is very entertaining, but read the trilogy first so that you can fill in the gaps as they pass across the screen.Another film review from The Squiss.

One Word - Extraordinary,"Having not yet read the book, I have to say this film comes along at a time when cinema is starving for epic storytelling, and riveting characters. This daring depiction of a country gone ""hungry"", for food, for games, for entertainment, and for the blood of its young, is simply too familiar, too close to disturbingly similar developments in recent years right here in the good old USA. That chill you feel down your spine is your conscience telling you to pay attention, and thanks to the skills and vision of both writer Suzanne Collins and Director Gary Ross, we have little choice but to pay attention. Judging by how hungry I am to experience the next chapter in this saga of a depressingly bleak future, where human beings are trapped in a frightening world of extreme poverty and horrifying opulence, unchecked greed, and an insatiable appetite for gratuitous mind-numbing and violent entertainment, there is little doubt Director Gary Ross has created the first installment in what portends to be one of Hollywood's most successful franchises of inspired filmmaking. For all that, The Hunger Games would have certainly earned at least 7+ stars, but one unexpected and inspired choice lifts this movie into the rarefied air of masterpiece, worth every bit the 10 star rating I believe it deserves. I'm talking about the choice to cast young Louisville actress Jennifer Lawrence in the role of Katniss Everdeen. Ms. Lawrence delivers an incredibly delicate, searing, Oscar-worthy portrayal of the film's reluctant heroine, who is forced to survive on wits, skill, and ultimately an indomitable will in a world gone mad. Reminiscent of her equally mesmerizing work in The Poker House and her Oscar-nominated performance in last year's ""Winter's Bone"", Jennifer Lawrence literally becomes one of recent popular literature's most admired and loved heroines. What this young actress can convey in her face and eyes is absolutely spellbinding, and this performance deserves all the praise it's now receiving, aptly embodied in one word by her Hunger Games co-star, Donald Sutherland, who described it as ""Extraordinary"". After casting Jennifer in her new movie ""Beaver"", Director Jodie Foster said of then 19 year old Ms. Lawrence, """"It's like she has tragedy etched in her face ...she has that thing in her face that's like she has been through something, you know she's been through something."" That quality, along with her ability to convince the viewer to buy into her character's story completely and want to know everything about her, establishes Jennifer Lawrence as a true star of the first order, whose performances compel us to watch, riveted by every moment she inhabits the screen. Director Gary Ross has said he would not have agreed to direct the Hunger Games had Jennifer Lawrence not been cast as Katniss. His reason? He said there was simply no other young actress who had the talent to pull it off so convincingly. Which is why I say - bring on the ""rest of the story"", Mr. Ross, Ms. Collins, and Ms. Lawrence. 18 months (till November 2013 when the next installment is scheduled for release), is an awfully long time to wait, but for Jennifer Lawrence and the team that created ""The Hunger Games"", I'll wait as long as it takes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
gonna watch kids killing kids? watch Battle Royal instead of this,"I'm gonna keep it short. If you've seen Battle Royal, you know what an awesome movie that is. This is the idea of Battle Royal, made in to something looking like Twilight. It is slow, lacks action and a couple of hours of My Little Pony would give me the same feeling. It is certainly cute, but with a story like this, there should be a LOT more made out of it.So, it is slow, it is cute, what else is there to it, really? not much, honestly. The acting is about average, the camera work is good and the director seems to have done what was expected.If I can really recommend it? Yes I can. If you like movies such as Twilight, you will probably enjoy this. But it is way to girlish for me, and I believe most males watching this will say the same thing. It is a decent movie, but wtf, if ppl gonna get murdered, give me some darn blood!If you are thinking about watching this, but haven't seen Battle Royal, I would have to say skip this one and go for the original story.

7.4 IMDb rating?,"I consider myself fairly open minded, and can find something to like in even very unlikely movies, but this movie was terrible. The lack of character development, explanations of premise, the shaky cam action, all awful. Glad the family only spent $5.99 to watch it On Demand last night. I can see how the books would be good where you can build this futuristic world in your head, but on screen it played out like a ripped off version of Survivor, that takes place outside of WhoVille. Just plain silly.To believe for one second that human beings advanced enough to build high speed rail and a futuristic city, would devolve to child murder for sport, is such a laughable stretch of one's belief as to insult the intelligence of even the most pedestrian viewer.Not sure how it attained a fairly lofty 7.4, from the reviews I read.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Uma adaptação simples, mas competente e autoral","""Various Games"" is a film with a child-juvenile structure but that seeks maturity not in its violence, but in its political framing. Following is better developed, but in this first one everything is simpler, we feel that the film could be much bigger if it had more budget, but the direction is competent with the invested budget, makeup and costumes are great, the special effects are not spectacular but work, what bothers me a lot is the direction of photography, which contrasts a lot with the film's special effects.The adaptation of the book is good, much smoother of course, but it transports the peripheral characters and the entire context of the plot well, one point for the film is the cast, if we care much more about the characters in the film because of the great acting and Extremely charismatic characters, in terms of acting, Jennifer Lawrence acts very well, although it is the least charismatic character, an actor who delivers a very good performance, despite little appearance is Donald Sutherland who plays President Snow.""Hunger Games"" had a premise, being the new teen phenomenon only more mature than the previous big franchises, it didn't, but it was a phenomenon nonetheless, and it was a better movie than its competitors and postulant as a crowd favorite at the time. . 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loved it!!,"OK after having read all the books in the series and the first book twice I would just like to say that I thought they did an excellent job on the movie. Obviously you can't put a whole book into a reasonable amount of time for a movie, but I went and saw it yesterday and I was very impressed. It's not very often that there is a movie about teenagers that is not overwhelmingly full of love and crushes and lovely things of that sort but they kept that part toned way down.There were some things that they changed that I was kind of sad about but they kept the suspense going very well. I personally liked the shaky cameras when they were running but sometimes the fights were hard to follow because they were so close up.As for the actors,I thought they were amazing. I had never heard of Jennifer Lawrence until I heard about this movie being made but she was awesome. I already liked Liam Hemsworth, but I think I am now in love with Josh Hutcherson too.All in all, I thought the movie was well acted, well written, and most definitely well done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Hollywood ""Ruined Another""","Let me start off by saying the casting was really good but thats the only thing good about ""Hunger Games"". The director and others took major key plot points/characters out of the book. For instance the Avox girl who in the books plays a pivotal part with Katness and the capital. Also they took out how Katness really got the Mockingjay pin and why the capital and President Snow are so evil. I also didn't like how they made this feel like the next teenage girl twilight movie trilogy. The Twilight movies sucked too and now since twilight series is ending Hollywood has gone and ruined a great book so they can bring in the crazed teenage girls to watch a movie that probably some have not even read. I was very disappointed with the movie and thought they put no effort what so ever into making ""Hunger Games"" into what it really could have been. A great book series one of my favorites turned into a disappointing and uneventful movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Waited weeks to review.... I am in love with the books and movie,"A few people are saying that this is nothing but a rip off of a Japanese film/story entitled ""Battle Royale"" While in fact it is very similar all in all The Hunger Games is a completely different concept/story. Although it does incorporate the same elements, it is a much more engaging story.I read all 3 of the books in less then a week and I still read them over and over. I was nervous to see how the film adaptation would be cause I know I was always upset of what they cut out of the Harry Potter movies, but I was pleasantly surprised that hardly anything was taken out of the first book, and only minimal things were slightly altered.I've seen this movie 7 times and each time I have taken a new person with me. Whether it be someone who has read the book or has never heard of it I have not heard one disappointed reaction....other then one of my friends who doesn't understand stories unless they're dumbed down like mirror mirror, but we forgive her cause she is slow.I'm very impressed how they made this movie with such a low budget, and still it feels like a huge summer blockbuster.I had the opportunity to experience the film in Dbox seats yesterday and I have to say.... That was incredible! It really made you feel like you were a part of the games and made it much more intense a viewing experience.I am simply giving a review, so no spoilers here, but I think everyone is making WAY too big a deal about this being, ""The most gruesome PG-13 movie of all time."" In all honesty it got the rating it deserved, but it isn't the most gruesome I've ever seen.

"This film is excellent, and VERY cleverly done.","I haven't actually read all of the first book, but I was so enticed in it i'd thought i'd see the film and compare the two. I must say, the film was sensational.The film started as the book started, with Katniss(Jennifer Lawrence) and her sister, Primrose (Willow Shields),in their small house. Both actresses played their parts exceptionally well, especially Jennifer, perfectly casted as Katniss.Throughout the film there was action and enticement on offer. There was also emotion felt, and scenes that kept on the edge of your seat. Best part and arguably the saddest, Rue's death, so emotional and directed perfectly, well done Gary Ross for that one.Overall the whole film is a success, and i hope it grosses so much money.

Loved it. Wonderful movie.,"I saw this movie about 3 weeks ago and I have to say that I loved this movie. I haven't finished the whole first book, but I actually liked the movie better than the book so far. Before I got into the theater, I thought to my self ""OMG this is going to be really long"", but I was enjoying myself so much that it went to quick and I think that if you are enjoying a movie, then it will go very quick.But anyhow I think the people here that didn't like it did not give it a chance. I also believe that people should be more respectful on what goes into a movie. People that make these movies have done the best job that they can to make a movie but on the other hand sometimes they don't work out that way. But this movie was just wonderful. It is a must-see, but if you haven't read all of the books yet, then I would recommend you read the books before you see the movie.I thought that Jennifer Lawrence was very good in it too.

Poor cinematography,"The cinematography was terrible during the first portion of the film and again later towards the end of the film. The camera lens was not steady instead moving in the opposite direction of the character.

Due to the rapid camera motion and rapid shot changes It was difficult to focus my eyes. My date and I both were nauseous. I simply do not see the point of this type of camera work.

Happy Hunger Games and May the Odds be EVER in Your Favor,"Every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the evil Capitol of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games. A twisted punishment for a past uprising and an ongoing government intimidation tactic, The Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which ""Tributes"" must fight with one another until one survivor remains. Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy. If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. -- (C) LionsgateAs someone who has read the novel, I must say now that THG is not a perfect adaptation. After all, when do you ever see a novel be perfectly translated to the big screen? Saying that, THG is an incredibly solid and strong effort that should please the fans of the series as well as those who are curious to see what the hype surrounding the film is. If I were to compare this to the Harry Potter and Twilight series, which, of course, is inevitable, you'll be happy when I say that it's a lot closer to the quality of Harry Potter than that of Twilight. I'd also like to end the issue of THG ""ripping off"" Battle Royale. Let's be honest here: Those who say THG is a ripoff of BR either haven't read THG or seen BR. While the two both revolve around the same concept, the executions are vastly different. THG and BR both deal with different issues and themes, and therefore, the comparison ends there. Additionally, there is no reason why you should like one and not the other.Getting all that out of the way, here are some issues I had with the film: Even with a long running time of 142 minutes, THG condenses a lot of events that play out in the novel and glosses over some details that I would have liked for the filmmakers to focus more on. The condensing of the material cuts a bit of characterization and makes emotional scenes feel rushed, and the glossing over of some details may make it difficult for someone who has not read the novel to understand what's going on. Furthermore, some of the CGI were a bit cartoonish, especially with the use of fire. Let's hope that the next film will get a bigger budget to improve on some of these effects.However, there are some great additions that came with the film too. Since the novel is written in Katniss' first-person perspective, we only get to know about what she sees and thinks. The film takes advantage of its format and adds some third-person scenes that ingeniously expand the world already created by author Suzanne Collins. As a result, some secondary characters that didn't have much presence in the novel have a lot more screen time in the film, including President Snow, Seneca Crane, and Haymitch. In particular, we get to see the behind-the-scenes of the Hunger Games in a control room where the tech people literally get to play Mother Nature. There are also some small plot changes that help set up the sequels.Director Gary Ross makes the great decision to downplay many things, with the use of hand-held cameras and the resistance to glorify many cinematic techniques. For example, the score by James Newton Howard is only used when is necessary, and when it is used, it's used effectively. This makes the world of Panem feel real and the issues more pressing. Of course, the shaky cameras also allow a lot of violence to pass with a PG-13 rating, resulting in possibly the most violent PG-13 film I've ever seen in my life so far. I also have to give a shout out to the sound department as well, which is another aspect that is taken advantage of to convey the violence. With the start of the film, we are put into an unusual world that we learn ourselves as the film progresses instead of the characters telling us every important plot point because they naturally know the rules of their world already. On top of that, the bleak and somber tone is done extremely well, with the build up to the game terrifying.Of course, this is Jennifer Lawrence's film, and the camera is mostly with her the entire way through. Accordingly, it's a good thing that Lawrence does a terrific job in her role, playing the strong-willed character with such incredible subtlety that it aches us when she finally does show her emotions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta does a great job as well, successfully giving the character the charismatic quality that was in the novel. Adult stars Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland are just great, doing justice to their roles. Sutherland, in particular, plays a menacing villain without showing much emotion at all, delivering his lines in such a subtle yet fierce manner.If you think about what the filmmakers had to work with, a book told in first-person of a new world, and saw what resulted on screen, the accomplishment is commendable, if not entirely amazing. With the direction of Gary Ross and a powerhouse performance from Jennifer Lawrence, THG is a faithful adaptation of the novel that deserves the success it receives. Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be EVER in the series' favor!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Well that was surprisingly effective and a pleasure to sit through,"I'd read a couple of professional reviews, thought I knew what to expect. I was wrong. One reviewer thought the motion camera was overdone. In the beginning it did seem as if it might go that way, but quickly it calms down and you forget about it. Another reviewer thought a couple of the characters needed some of their back story told as in the book, but I didn't read the book and didn't miss it at all.What I noticed first was how gripping it all quickly became. I think the director and his screenwriters did a wonderful job. It felt as if the essence of some very compelling book was being conveyed. And that actually was what I thought about second, that I am now extremely curious to know more about the book's author, Suzanne Collins. This film gives no indication it was written by some wishy washy woman without a clue about real combat. There's been some real thought given to what might have happened in real life though her real gift to her readers is her keen understanding of the way leaders manipulate.But the real driving force behind this movie is divided between the writing and the lead, the mega-impressive Jennifer Lawrence. I remember seeing her in 'Winter's Bone' another film set in hill country and thinking I'd like to see more of her. Boy, was I right. Spending the time of this movie with her is a true joy. But her real trick is, I still want more! Something about watching her is very rewarding. I'm at a complete loss as to what exactly except that I kept thinking I know exactly what she's thinking and feeling. That's very rare, especially for such a young actress, I think, to be able to reach an old guy like me so clearly and effortlessly.Of the rest I'd give special attention to Woody Harrelson who is spot on and Donald Sutherland who seems to know about leadership for real. I've no idea where this trilogy is going but I do know I want to see it as it seems millions of others do. I saw this at a matinée in a smallish town and it was packed. I don't doubt this series will be in the Potter range.Finally I'd mention one small quibble I have, but what for? You'll probably notice it yourself and then quickly forgive the director for it.

The Next Bog Thing (But Does It Deserve It?),"Out with the old (Potter and those shiny vampires), in with the new! The Hunger Games is the next in line of young adult adaptations steamrolling their way into the theaters, to the extreme delight and disappointment of fans of the books.The arguments are eternal: Did it really capture the tone of the book? Did they get all the details right? Did that character actually look like that?On and on they go, but really, the only question that should be asked is, did they make a good movie? In order to get that answer, let's move right ahead into the review and see what made it onto the big screen.The Hunger Games is a dystopian tale of twelve outlying districts that must sacrifice one young boy and one young girl up to their capital every year to participate in a televised battle to the death. Katniss Everdeen volunteers herself in place of her younger sister and we follow her into battle, not only over the other ""tributes"", but also over the deadly pitfalls in the arena and the bloodthirsty nature of a society that allows these games to continue.First off, this movie clocked in at just under two and a half hours, which is incredibly long for a teen flick. Even Harry Potter didn't dare create such a marathon until well into the franchise where they knew fans would eat up every minute of it. Also highlighting the length was the incredibly slow pacing. The experience was oddly reminiscent of seeing The Da Vinci Code, where the original book was an eye-popping page turner, but the on-screen rendition seemed to suck all the life out of it. The Hunger Games didn't quite starve itself into a cinematic coma, but there certainly was a momentum and energy missing in the translation.As for the actors, Jennifer Lawrence was the prodigal choice and really brought much of that angst, conflict and fire-in-the-belly attitude Katniss needed to have. Josh Hutcherson also displayed a great deal of the heartfelt charm and inner strength that made Peeta such an easy character to root for in the books. Wes Bentley also gets a special mention for pulling off the expertly choreographed beard, but I missed a touch of the creepiness I expected from the Head Gamekeeper. Beyond that, everyone I felt did what they needed to do, but there weren't any stand out performances.The story was there, the pages played out on-screen almost right off the page, but it felt like they tried too hard to capture everything from the book, making it overly long, yet dropped particular sections that would have better served the overall experience. In that regard, without going into too much detail, I'll point to the mutts and how disappointing that entire sequence was. The whole point of who and what they were was lost, making them nothing more than aggressive bulldogs.Now there have been reviews buzzing around all weekend about this movie, so this will likely get swept away in the digital wind of the internet, but I must say this in closing. To those people who were upset because Rue and Thresh were cast as African-Americans, while Suzanne Collins didn't feel the need to spend a whole lot of time and energy repeatedly describing the races of her characters, those two were in fact written as ""dark skinned"", so the casting was not ""politically correct"", just correct. Secondly, to those people who went the step further to say that you felt less when they died because of that casting, yep, you guessed it, you're racist.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A successful adaptation in every way possible...,"The very point of young adult literature is to give the few young individuals with an interest in reading, a world to immerse themselves in, and a character or two to root for, who will hopefully teach them a thing or two about the world they live in, and hopefully, about themselves. Such a character should be a role model for these young people. In 2012, we are left with no more ""Harry Potter"" films to be made. The ""Twilight"" series, which has albeit made a great deal of money, doesn't quite cut it for those of us who expect something more from our movie-going experience.""The Hunger Games"" has it all: a wonderful slew of characters, an unfamiliar and interesting world, real problems to overcome, not to mention a star-making performance by Jennifer Lawrence. One major problem that I find in the ""Twilight"" series lies in the lack of role models for young women reading them. Bella Swan is an idiot. She relies on men for every single thing she does, and doesn't change and become her own person over the course of the four books, ultimately becoming the epitome of anti-feminism, in this viewer's eyes.Having said that, ""The Hunger Games"" is something of a godsend. Katniss Everdeen is headstrong, brutal, resourceful, witty, uncannily smart and a truly original personality. She knows when to back down, yet she knows when to take charge. She is an ideal role model for young people who will undoubtedly approach the film.""The Hunger Games"" takes place in the post-apocalyptic region of Panem, divided into twelve ""districts"". Once a year, an Olympics-style event takes place where one young man and woman from each of the twelve districts is forced to take part in a fight to the death on national television, where only one contestant can survive. A member of working- class District 12, Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) takes her young sister's place after she has somehow been chosen in her first year of eligibility. Katniss has essentially raised her sister, with a mother who has been useless ever since the father's death. She learns to put her knowledge to good use, becomes something of a badass in her quest to above all else, stay alive.Like I mentioned, Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, is a revelation. She clearly knew the character she was playing. While her performance is strong and ever-commanding, the character of Katniss was never permitted to let her true emotions show, and Lawrence obviously understood that. She couldn't have been better. Josh Hutcherson does a good enough job as Peeta, the other contestant from District 12, who becomes a good friend to Katniss; and possibly a love interest? We'll let the next film in the trilogy tackle that.The film has a tremendous supporting cast, including Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, the often-inebriated mentor to Katniss and Peeta, ""30 Rock""'s Elizabeth Banks as the loud and flamboyant Effie, Donald Sutherland as the country's president, and the always-great Stanley Tucci, as Caesar.My only gripe lies with director Gary Ross, who has previously directed ""Seabiscuit"" and ""Pleasantville"". His shaky camera-work works in scenes where we're seeing events from a character's perspective, especially when the ""games"", themselves, begin. However, shaky hand-held camera- work is present, even in scenes where only two characters are having a conversation. Why? It's distracting, and should have been done differently.However, Ross did a well enough job interpreting this novel, which I believe many other directors could have screwed up. He made a sensitive, yet not-for-the-faint-of-heart film out of a novel that felt exactly the same way. Like the ""Twilight"" series, there is a love story in ""The Hunger Games"", but it's not the most important thing going on. The film could stand as simply an adaptation of a novel, or could be interpreted as social commentary, with obvious hints being made about the Occupy Wall Street movement, as well as the grim picture it paints of what our society could one day become. Yet it's quality entertainment that even the least discerning film-goer can appreciate. Bring on ""Catching Fire"".Grade: A",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not terrible, but you could still do a whole lot better in this genre.","I struggled between 5 and 6 here.I had a few problems with some of the effects, and the film just didn't have the huge epic look that I was expecting from such a blockbuster release. They really maximized the profit margin here. I swear they put half the average-to-meeger blockbuster budget in marketing. Hard to believe that Kurt Wimmer made a film that looked as good(or should I say as slightly fake) as Hunger Games with his nearly decade old release, Equilibrium. Only Kurt did it with a million bucks, and the movie was significantly better!That said, I'm a little disappointed in this one. It's not terrible. It's not good either.One of the films major flaws is the complete lack of chemistry between the leads. The way the two leads are written - you almost think they should hate each other. They do early on, but the ""growing"" relationship part of this story makes no sense whatsoever. Just no chemistry at all here. Peeta Malark comes off as a cold, heartless coward, and that just really belittles Katnis Everdeen's character when she starts to ""Fall"" for this nincapoop. I liked the fact that Katnis learned her media lessons throughout the film, but I was never sold on any attachment to Peeta. One minute Peeta is helping the others hunt Katnis down - the next minute they're kissing in a cave.This was an alright passing of the time. I didn't reach to turn it off. The pacing was OK. I won't watch this again even if it's down the road on cable.Significantly over-rated at it's current 7.4 here. Just thinking about a film like ""Frantic"" from Roman Polanski being .6 lower at 6.8 kinda makes me queesy.This one made me feel like I did after watching ""The Running Man"" for the first time back in the 80's. It's a little cheesy, and a bit disappointing.57/100 You MIGHT like this if you liked:The Running Man(slightly better or about even), Logan's Run(better than HG), Battle Royale(better than HG), No Escape(ever-so-slightly worse than HG), In Time(equally average)or Gymkata(much worse)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"this movie is just like ""american idol""---Meh.......!","this overly hyped movie is definitely for the teenagers, because i really didn't think it's such a good movie worth so many praises. it's a hunger game, the time was in the future, the whole world's economy was in ruin but somehow, the 1% rich and powerful of the nation still existed as usual and all lived in the capital, dressed like queers and weirdos with funny hairdos and make-up, and the other 99% population poor people were forced to live in 12 districts (i found myself very difficult to make this premise of this movie sounds logical) and they were in a constant hungry situation (but somehow all the people didn't look as those human beings lived in a long term hunger condition, at least it just looked so different from what we used to see in Africa). young people lived in hunger would become so energetic when they were chosen to the become the hunters and the hunted? where did they get the sudden energy? the ran, they fought, the climbed, they killed....yeah, right, guess once they became the members of the death candidates, they just turned into killing machine overnight. give me a break. we've seen ""hanna"", a young teenager assassin, then we've seen ""in time"", people could swap their lives and their existing time just by hooking up their arms together to make the living time donation..... what's going on? where's the logic? where's the good old Sci-Fi movies? we obviously do not live in the age of reason anymore, just like the gas prices inflated at will overnight by the big oil companies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Hunger Games: A Thrilling Adaptation, but the Book Remains Superior","The Hunger Games is a gripping dystopian adventure film that brings to life the brutal world of Panem and the harrowing struggles of its inhabitants. The movie follows the story of Katniss Everdeen, who volunteers to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a televised battle to the death between 24 young tributes from the 12 districts of Panem.The film manages to capture the tense and suspenseful atmosphere of the book, with stunning visuals and a talented cast of actors. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a powerful performance as Katniss, perfectly capturing the character's strength, vulnerability, and determination. Other standout performances include Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy.The film's direction and cinematography are also top-notch, effectively conveying the oppressive nature of the Capitol and the visceral violence of the Hunger Games. The action scenes are intense and well-choreographed, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.However, as is often the case with adaptations, the movie falls short of the book in some aspects. While the film does an admirable job of condensing the story into a two-hour runtime, it lacks some of the depth and nuance of the source material. Some important plot points and character developments are left out, which may leave viewers unfamiliar with the book feeling confused or unsatisfied.Overall, The Hunger Games is a good movie that successfully brings the world of Panem to life. However, fans of the book may find themselves missing some of the details and complexity that made the novel so compelling. Nevertheless, the film is a thrilling ride that is definitely worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A solid book-to-screen adaptation,"Let's start with a positive: This cast is star-studded. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean the stars do a good job, but it's a start-- and luckily for us, they do a tremendous job. Jennifer Lawrence enters the celebrity life coming out of her role as Mystique from X-Men, and perhaps for another time to discuss, I hate that character. With that said, she was also coming from an Oscar nomination for Winter's Bone-- a lifeless film that nobody need bother to see unless you're just compelled enough for the one bright spot of the film which is her performance. And Jenny from the block is handed the role of Katniss Everdeen, a persistent heroine sure to have inspired girls everywhere. Needless to say, she had big shoes to fill, for everybody would be judging whether she fit the mold of the character envisioned from the book. And emphatically I will tell you that she succeeds. You root for the gender role breaking Katniss at every step. Perhaps even more impressive than Lawrence are the people she is surrounded by. The unrestrained costume designs for the Capitol work so well with Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Bank's characters. But easily my favorites are the hilarious Woody Harrelson and Wes Bentley's beard.Undoubtedly, you guys know the basis for The Hunger Games. Even so, it is important to at least talk about the structure. There are two distinct halves in the film: the ceremonies before the Games, and the Games themselves. And in the off chance that you have no idea what The Hunger Games is, I shall briefly clarify. A future dystopia consists of 12 districts. In order to keep the threats of revolt at ease, fear is struck by an event known as the Hunger Games that takes place annually. Everybody ages 12-18 have their names put in to be drawn at random with two tributes from the 12 districts, a male and female. And for those of you counting at home, that's 24 tributes every year.Katniss lives in District 12 with her sister and mother. This district is mineral based, and thus, also hard-working and poor. To the credit of the film, lots of this can be inferred through visual context instead of pointless exposition. The film is 140 minutes, and even though I think that could have been reduced through some cuts, it reminds me of what happened with Jurassic Park. Just like author Suzanne Collins, Jurassic Park author Michael Crichton also had a hand in writing the screenplay for the film adaptation. And he explained what he did by saying that about 10% of the book made it to big screen, and this is simply because that's all that could be fit into it. Similarly, there's details I wished to have seen made it to the movie, but there's only so much that can be done. With all that they had, there's nothing huge that got excluded to cause any outrage.Something becoming familiar ground is a love triangle in these dystopian teenage novels. And there's certainly glimpses of this in this film, but I'm glad we aren't swarmed by it (can't speak for the sequels). One of my negatives follows from this. I have been a fan of Josh Hutcherson, but to be a little hypocritical, he is not what one imagines as Peeta. The best way to describe his performance is just ""good,"" nothing more, and really nothing less. And completing the triangle is Katniss's childhood friend, Gale. And I'm not sure how much there is to think about for Katniss, for when I have the chance to pick either Josh Hutcherson or Liam Hemsworth, you know I'd take Liam any day... What, I'm getting off track? I do apologize.As I said before, there are two halves to this film. And separately, they both work. And they are necessary together, but it is pacing that simply is designed better for a book. The ceremonies are fresh and entertaining, but it's a lot of build up for what will end up turning into another half of the film. And this again plays into my belief that ten minutes or so of run time could have been cut to flow everything better. In regards to the Games themselves, I think what was accomplished is pretty astounding. I was so curious how you transfer weeks of survival in the forest into an hour of action-packed fatal adventure. There's never a dull in the action, yet no scene is forced. And the brilliantly harrowing setup for Collins's plot is transferred to the screen by shaky cams that bring the audience to the arena while giving glimmers of wonderful nature in, ultimately, all that the Capitol and its citizens see, a reality show-like game. Gruesome? Absolutely. Stunning? Well, not on the same level of some beautiful films, but for the sake of compliments, yes, stunning.

Not As Good As The Book,"The Hunger Games wants to be the next Running Man and Twilight but fails at that. Director Gary Ross tries to capture the mood of the book, but he does not capture the sense of urgency and misses the political edge that the book so possessed.Jennifer Lawrence is a perfect actress for the job, and posses the perfect mix of venerability and anger and heart. She makes the Hunger Games worth watching even if it overstays its 142 minute runtime and displays the nauseating shaky cam during the action sequences. Josh Hucherson is OK as Peeta but Liam Hemsworth as Gale who does not get much screen time, would have been a better choice to portray him.Overall, the Hunger Games is a mixed bag. Hopefully, the sequel is better",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"The World Will Be Watching ""The Hunger Games""","The dystopian genre is refreshing to me. It's hard to present that, especially for PG-13 movies. I love how ""The Hunger Games"" bring a satisfying dystopian sci-fi action adventure movie.The story happens in the ruins of what once known as North America, called in their time as Panem. Its government the Capitol requires a girl and a boy, called Tributes, from each of the twelve districts to send to the Hunger Games, where only one will come out alive. Katniss Everdeen volunteers for her younger sister Primrose. She meets her co-tribute Peeta Mellark, who has saved her from hunger for giving her a piece of burnt bread.I like how the movie deals with a totalitarian government. It's unusual for a teen movie to talk about it. The action scenes are okay, but mixed with drama. Children ages 12-18 are forced to fight against one another for survival, which includes killing. It also tackles entertainment, like reality TV. I just hate the shaky camera. It's dizzying.There's a cliffhanger. So expect for a sequel, and I'll see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Stronger Version of Yourself,"Hunger Games is my go-to escape from my dystopian life. The characters are my friends, vivid and real. They make this a great film. Like Katniss, I want to become a selfless leader who puts my loved ones first. I want to become the spark that lights the way for others to find freedom in a broken world. In saving others, we come a stronger person and develop into who we were meant to be. Then the movie ends, and I find myself back in my dystopian world. Will I rise to make a difference like Katniss, or will I simply play out my expected role like Effie? I highly recommend this movie if you need a motivational push to become a stronger version of yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Beautifully grotesque.,"The Hunger Games is a new concept in a long line of post-apocalyptic future fantasies. Where other stories of the same genre often deal with technology and artificial intelligence as the main threat to human existence, Hunger Games actually takes us back to Roman times, with a revitalised version of ""Panem et Circenses"" or ""Bread and Circuses"". Simply put; human devastation as mass entertainment. Welcome to Panem: formerly known as The United States of America, where every year, a young man and woman from each of the twelve districts are selected to fight each other to the death, with only one possible survivor. These Games are broadcast on national television as a means to keep the people happy and submissive.Considering the fact that this film is based on a teen book series (written by Suzanne Collins), I can't help but feel this concept is pretty far out there, and actually it's kind of sick. It's not a pretty idea to think that one day we might live in a world where watching young people, ranging from 12 to 18 years old, brutally murder each other is considered to be a form of mass entertainment. Thankfully, this is 'just' a story, and I must say, a very entertaining one at that (no pun intended).The story revolves around the two youngsters from District 12, where the people are dirt poor and life is utterly desolate. 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen volunteers as 'tribute' to fight in the Hunger Games, after her little sister is initially selected. Her male counterpart is Peeta Mellark, and together they set off to train for and participate in the Games.The character of Katniss is played by Jennifer Lawrence, and she is terrific. Actually, she is my biggest recommendation for watching this film. Before this, I had only seen her in X- Men: First Class and thought she was pretty good, but after seeing The Hunger Games, it's not hard to see why this 21-year-old already has her first Oscar nomination under her belt. She has a very natural quality about her, which makes it very easy to make you empathise with her character. She's not a superficial, happy-go-lucky kind of girl; she's actually very sullen, not even particularly likable. And yet you just love her from the get go. I guess it's charisma, and Jennifer Lawrence definitely has it.Actually, this film is full of great actors. One of the greatest is definitely Stanley Tucci, who plays his most flamboyant role yet. His character (Caesar Flickerman, the TV-host who emcees the Games) is ridiculously over-the-top, but brilliantly amusing. With blue hair, prosthetic teeth and a big horse's smile which he flashes incessantly, he looks like a PG-13 version of the Joker. And if you're at all familiar with Tucci's work and talent, you know just what I mean when I say he's making this character appear to be oh-so nice, yet subtly sadistic at the same time. He's just great, period. Woody Harrelson also has a pretty interesting role as Haymitch Abernathy, a once-winner of the Hunger Games, who now mentors Katniss and Peeta in their training. He's scruffy and gnarly, basically just typically another weird Woody character, which is always worth the watch. Wes Bentley plays Seneca Crane, a character most notable for his unusual facial hair: he sports a beard Lucifer himself would be proud of. However, the biggest surprise to me was Elizabeth Banks, whom I am well familiar with, but never really cared for because I only know her from superficial, comedic roles. I was pleasantly surprised to see that she can also play challenging roles like this one. She plays Effie Trinket, a bizarre, neo-Renaissance type from the richest District, big wig, crazy make-up and all. She's pretty much the female version of Tucci's character and she was a delight to watch, beautifully grotesque in all her decadence.Unfortunately, it can't all be great. I had three major problems with this film. One: if you haven't read the book, there's a lot that doesn't make sense. They really should have spent a little more time explaining everything, because more than once it simply wasn't clear to me what was going on and why. Two: Peeta's character. It could be just me of course, but he annoyed the crap out of me. He just comes across as such a sissy that it's frustrating to watch. Katniss burns her leg and deals with it. Peeta cuts his leg and stays lying in a cave because he ""can't walk"". And then he lets her take care of him, at the risk of her own life. Give me a break. Three: totally disappointing climax. I was waiting for fireworks, for Katniss having to make brutal decisions, but this never happened. It just kind of faded out.And this is how you can clearly tell this story has a mainly teenage demographic, and they obviously wanted to keep it PG-13. Because despite the sometimes pretty brutal violence, nasty use of weaponry and tomato ketchup-a-plenty, overall the whole just lacked, well... balls. You can tell they tried to spike things up a bit here and there, but the film failed to make things truly interesting at moments where it definitely should have been. In my opinion, had they decided to make this rated-R, it would have been infinitely better.Having said that, you can rest assured there is still plenty to enjoy. Visually it is absolutely awesome and simply beautiful. The costumes and make-up are great, as are the CGI effects. The characters (aside from Peeta...) are great, and the whole futuristic 'universe' that is created is pretty inventive.There is actually still a lot more I would like to say, but I've reached my word-limit, so I'll just leave you with this: Thumbs up!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A missed opportunity...,"I will start off by saying that I did not read the books. I'm also one of those people that when I first saw the trailer, I thought it was a Battle Royale remake. When I found out it wasn't, I was quite surprised, cause they seemed very similar. You cant always judge a film by it's trailer though. So to be fair, I decided to give this movie a chance, and not go into it comparing the two.The movie has quite a slow start, and even though they take a long time building up; I didn't get the idea that I was getting to know any of the characters. They really didn't do a good job making any of the characters likable, or let them develop in any way. The main character in this film, Katniss, was already portrayed as a tough girl from the very beginning of the film. Nothing in the first part of the movie did anything to either develop this, or add to it.When the games finally start, I was kind of excited, because I was looking forward to some action finally. Unfortunately for me; the action was lacking quite a bit. Shaky camera-work, which I guess is meant to be artistic these days, left a lot of the killing to your imagination. Due to lack of character building in the beginning of the film, I didn't really mind who died, cause I didn't feel any connection with any of the characters. On top of that; many scenes from the actual games seem to be lacking dept, reason or logic. It was as if they went for too many scenes in too little time. This resulted into the whole story of the movie being kind of blur to me, and left me wondering if there was even one there.On a positive note; the acting was quite OK. Jennifer Lawrence portrayed her role quite well, and her acting had nothing to do with me not being able to relate to her character. Elizabeth Banks was splendid, as a character that at first sight seems totally misplaced in this world, but totally works in the way it's portrayed.All in all, I'll have to be fair and say I don't quite get the hype. The movie seemed to be lacking in too many areas, in order for me to stay interested throughout the entire two and a half hours. Not comparing this film to Battle Royale while watching it was made quite easy, simply because this wasn't close to being as good. A missed opportunity for an interesting theme like this!",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Why All the Hate?,"I was a huge fan of the first 2 books, The Hunger Games & Catching Fire, (I haven't read Mockingjay) and I was extremely excited for the movie. And you know what, I Loved it! I felt it captured the tone of the book beautifully. Jennifer Lawrence killed the role of Katniss and deserves to be recognized by the awards next year. The acting was great, they pulled off the tone greatly, and I just loved it. It is a slow burner and that may irritate people but, so was the book. My only real issue was they didn't develop the love story between Katniss and Peeta well. In the book you can clearly see Katniss' feelings towards Peeta grow from disliking him to falling in love with him. In the movie it sort of just happens. I thought the movie breezed right by. It did not feel like 2hrs 22mins. I thought the movie worked. It was fast paced, had strong acting, and is probably my favorite book-to-movie adaptation.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Read the book first, please.","This movie was in it's whole, better than I thought it would be. Making a book-to-movie adaptation can be very hard, especially when you have to try and find a way to portray a character as complex and analytical as Katniss. But I have to give kudos to Jennifer Lawrence for taking on that role, and playing her beautifully. I'll admit, she was a bit more agressive and impulsive than the book version, but it's easily forgivable considering Katniss's thought life being just as cynical and sometimes aggressive. I relate to her very much. She wasn't in it for the glory. She sacrificed herself for her sister and mother, and because she knew she had a better chance of surviving. She has a sense of duty stronger than most fictional characters I've read about.
To people who haven't read the book, I can understand if they don't like it. There are a lot of plot points that weren't explained properly, and for a person who's diving into this movie without having read the book, it can be very confusing, and honestly just unsatisfactory. So, if you want to understand the movie, and maybe enjoy it more, I highly reccommend reading the book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Excellent, a breath of fresh air","'The Hunger Games' has received a lot of hype lately and it has deserved every bit of it! The story is great, I regret not reading the books before going to see the film because it's such an interesting story. The script is very good, dialogue can be a bit bland at points but it can be excellent in certain scenes. Actors in this film perform really well, there's no weak links aside from a few of the district tributes but they do not get a lot of screen time anyway. Jennifer Lawrence is, of course, amazing. She has shown she is a serious actress and has really out-done herself in this. Josh Hutcherson also performed well along with Liam Hemsworth despite not having a lot of screen time, he still makes an impression. My favourite performance however, was by Stanley Tucci. He was excellent, his role was not the most vital but it did shape a lot of the film's context, with him being the cheesy show host with a big fake smile and catch-phrases. His performance was without a doubt the best in the film.The editing was really well done, it must have been difficult to try and make such a violent plot become child friendly, they've managed to do their best. It cleverly cuts away from violent scenes meaning very little blood is shows so you think you've seen something horrible when you haven't really, it's a good example of how films do not need to be violent to have an impact. However, young children can still be frightened by this because it can be very jumpy, particularly during the climax, and the sound effects could scare easily.The only problem I had with this film was some of the hand-held camera work was just too much, there were points where the camera was jolting so much that you didn't really know what was going on.Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this film to both children and adults however, I do believe only people over 12 should watch this film as it can be quite frightening. This film is a breath of fresh air and shows that a blockbuster can be cinematically great as well as commercially.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Average...only a couple of big frustrating things.,"There were only maybe 1 or 2 scenes with good directing and camera work, but most of the movie has so many close up shots and cuts that occur so frequently (seems like every 5-10 seconds) with never enough time to fully immerse or focus. Other than that, the story/plot was well told and written thanks to the author of the book, however I felt like they must've left out at least a couple of important things. Donald Sutherland played a good villain surprisingly and I'm excited to see what happens with the franchise going forward since I've heard Catching Fire is much better (I have unfortunately never seen or read The Hunger Games and I know I should have).

"A very good science, fiction action, drama film","The Hunger Games is a great science fiction, action and drama film. I will not by a hypocrite and tell you guys that it was a nice movie but it had some stupid things in it just to appear lofty. I really liked The Hunger Games! I do not consider it to be actual Oscar material, but it is a great film that keeps you interested and makes you anxious to see what happens next.It's weird to say this, because she is only 21 years old, but I have always loved Jennifer Lawrence as an actress. I first saw her in Winter's Bone, and after that I tried to find other movies in which she starred. And I must mention that I liked her in most of her performances. In The Hunger Games she stars as Katniss Everdeen, and I think she nails the role perfectly.I liked the way Gary Ross directed this film, considering it is only his third film(as a director). The script isn't that great, but I guess that in this kind of a film it's not fundamental for it to be so. The makeup artist did a very good job, so congratulations to him/her also.The one place the director should've insisted more, was the relationship between Jennifer Lawrence and John Hutcherson. I have not read the book, although I intend to, but I think he should have defined their relationship a bit better. The main reason for this, is because in some parts of the film I kind of got confused about how they really felt about each other.What can I say more above the fact that I am really looking forward to the next film in this franchise?

Attractive story but poorly made,"I haven't read the Hunger Games book so I can't say if the adaptation has been a success.The film had a very attractive beginning for me. A totalitarian state which still punishes its people for a rebellion committed many years ago. It reminded me of the world of George Orwell's ""1984"". The people of the districts will have to pay for their rebellion and live a deprived life while the people of the Capitol, Panem, live a life of plenty and extravagance.Which reminds of another Orwellian element in the story: the ignorance in which people of the Capitol live. The whole frenzy of the people of the Capitol about the Hunger Games -- the deaths, the violence, the bets -- is out of their ignorance, and quite frightening.The whole setting of the film and the story quite fascinated me and promised a very good film. But as it went on, it became more and more a teenager film with big flaws in the story and the characters.As a whole, the film is entertaining and doesn't make you bored even at about two and a half hours.

Impressive and powerful,"I was sort of obsessed with this movie when it came out. Watching it years later I still love it but can understand that I was a little infatuated. It's a solid flick and I think what makes it work so well is because of the smaller moments. The film is filled with brilliant performances from Woody Harrelson, Jennifer Lawrence, Elizabeth Banks and especially Josh Hutchinson. From the flashbacks to the revelations of his character he really nails. Also good are Wes Bentley with the coolest beard ever, Donald Sutherland and a surprisingly complex Alexander Ludwig. It's easy to write off Kato as one note. A hulking, looming privileged character but those moments he gives him towards the end really make a huge difference. Unfortunately the other love interest of sorts Liam Hemsworth is just eye candy. The movie is disturbing and well made but lacks the punch it really needs to drive the desperation and darkness of the material home.

I mean, everything was way too predictable.And you will probably get what happens next after the first 30 minutes!What is more, the camera shake was at times annoying- and by seeing the movie in the cinema, I was even more annoyed by it. Unnecessary again.However, the fantasy part was well developed and it was the only ""up"" for me. Special effects made it for me.All in all, if you think of watching this movie - think twice. Unless you're a fan of the books and you're curious about the adaptation, I wouldn't recommend seeing it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Do not Judge a Book By It is Movie,"First of all ""they say, do not judge a book by it is movie"" and I understood the wisdom guy who said it, after I watched this movie. When I watched this movie I had not read the book collections. After I watched the movie we made critic with my friends and I looked the comments via Google and IMDb. They all said, the movie and the book is not in the same scale. After I heard this kind of comments , I decided to read the book collection. What a masterpiece. So, if I need to talk about the movie itself ( I am not the kind of the man who like the humiliate the movies or books) but this movie is not deserve high quality comments or rates and this is because of the good quality of books. When you look the movie you can not even identify the characters like the book itself. Especially Rue (Amandla Stenberg) we do not know why Rue is helping to Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) I could not understand it in the movie. If there is something that I learn from this movie, it is read the book and later on the movie otherwise there will be actions you do not understand.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Engaging, but a sad commentary","Twenty-four teenagers, one male and one female from each district, ages 12-18, enter into a fight to the death as part of the government's payback for earlier uprisings. The event is televised. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) from District 12 takes her sister's place in the competition. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta is the male from District 12.This movie proves that people go to auto races to see accidents. If you can get over the idea of kids killing kids, then you may enjoy this movie. How does one do that? Well, some will say it's all tastefully done; and there are instances where the killings come as a result of self-defense.If I said the name Katniss 10,000 times over and over again, I may get used to it. Every time I heard it I said ""catnip"" to myself (easy now). Jennifer Lawrence, as Katniss, carries this movie to perfection. We know she doesn't want to kill anyone, yet.there's that self-defense thing that comes along. Yes, yes, we hope she wins.Observations: the nervous camera was in evidence for about the first 15-minutes, then it went away as well it should. The people who run the television event and other elites have the most garish fashion sense. It's like they all came from the Mad Hatter's tea party. And, don't get me started on the hairdos, beards and a new way to slap-on lipstick. You see, because this takes place waaaaay in the future, we have to be bombarded with extremes. After a while we do get used to these fashion extremes. Sad, but true.I didn't expect the first half of the movie to drag but, it did with the training and securing of sponsors (who help the participants). The hype that went on for years before the movie was released didn't go into that.Each team is given a mentor to advise them on how to survive in the woods, the battleground for the Hunger Games. The Mentors were previous winners in the Hunger Games. Woody Harrelson plays a mentor part to perfection. The guy should be given Oscars for just showing up. He is that good. And, aside from Jennifer Lawrence, he steals the show. It wouldn't surprise me if Jennifer Lawrence is nominated for an Oscar as she was in WINTER'S BONE, a great movie. And, Woody Harrelson also.Other notables: Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, and Donald Sutherland who performed well. Donald Sutherland as President Snow says the thing more powerful than fear is hope. The way I see it the contestants and the parents of the participants have hope. The audience sits in fear. If the audience ever gets hope that things can change Snow's government will fall.There is a certain amount of tension and suspense throughout because we side with Katniss, who is wary of everything, as are we. Now for the kicker - more tension: the ones running the show can inject fire or wild animals into the event if they feel they are losing or losing face. Why they would do that blew my mind. Yes, that is not fair. The contestants have no recourse but to fend for themselves. The audience watching all this doesn't seem to be too upset about it. The audience is every bit of sheep mentality. Is this where we are heading? There are political agendas in here and you may see the implications.Here is what I was hoping for throughout: that the contestants or the audience would somehow put a stop to these Hunger Games forever. But the ending for this movie is extremely weak. Go see for yourself. But, oh, oh, a sequel is coming: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire in 2013. Sad, but true.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nice Movie!!,"This movie was actually VERY great. I was sort of expecting it to be really terrible like most films that are based on a book. Not this one. It was very action packed for a PG13 movie, but there are SOME flaws though.One: There should have been a Madge. I think it would have worked better if there was a Madge to give Katniss the pin.Two: I think it was kind of rushed, but I don't blame them. If it were longer than two hours and thirty minutes I think I would have peed my pants though. Two hours and thirty minutes is pretty appropriate for this film.Three: I think that the movie could have been more steady. I mean sure they're in a forest with explosions and all that, but I just think that they shouldn't have filmed this so shakily. I think I was really dizzy watching this movie.Those are the ONLY flaws to this movie. Overall, it was very impressive. I think they really stayed true to the book.I mean what did you guys expect? For the movie to be better than the book? I don't think that's EVER going to happen. Not in a million years. I highly recommend this movie, if not, read the book!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Big Cinema circus/hype that *almost* stilled my hunger,"I'm only in my early thirties, but extremely grumpy and old-fashioned for my age. I'm a giant admirer of classic horror/cult cinema and thus consequently a hater of everything that falls under the category of popular new teenage age trends, including remakes of classic horror movies and ridiculously over-hyped and phony franchises (like ""Twilight"", for instance). I automatically assumed that ""The Hunger Games"" would fall under this last subcategory and thus decided not to waste any time or money on it, but then it came on television and I had nothing better to watch, so what the hell. I must admit that I was quite entertained by this first movie in the franchise and – contrary to what I feared –compared to ""The Hunger Games"", any entry in the ""Twilight"" saga looks like an episode of the ""Teletubbies"". Obviously I still think this movie is tremendously overrated and I didn't like it enough in order to run out and immediately purchase all the other sequels right away, but at least I was pleasantly surprised by the overall grim & depressing atmosphere, the brutality of some of the death sequences and the execution of the basic story concept. Speaking of which, the plot is as old as cinema itself and absolutely doesn't anything original. Back in 1933 already, there was a fabulous movie that dealt about the hunting-humans formula – entitled ""The Most Dangerous Game"" – and since then there came copious of rip-offs, imitations or variants. Some of them are cheap and dull (""Bloodlust!""), some of them are sleazy (""The Women Hunt""), some of them are extremely violent (""Blood Camp Thatcher"") and some of them became legendary cult classics themselves (""Battle Royale""). Some of them already even integrated the sub plot of the hunting game being one giant reality TV show, like ""The Running Man"" and Lucio Fulci's obscure piece of Sci-Fi trash ""The New Gladiators"". Basically that's all ""The Hunger Games"" is; another umpteenth re-telling of ""The Most Dangerous Game"", except this time it's based on a novel that all teenagers across the world have read and loved, so they think it's unique and groundbreaking. It's definitely innovating at all, but I'm already glad that it became a thriller with a a reasonably disturbing dystopian setting, a fair amount of suspense, intense situations and above average acting performances. Somewhere in the (not too distant) future, the nation of Panem – which is whatever is left over from the United States – is divided into 12 districts, ranged from proud and powerful to pitiable and poor. Once per year, the authorial president Snow organizes the ""hunger games""; a big media circus in which 24 randomly selected participants, two from each district, and unleashed into a wilderness where they battle each other to the death. In District 12, Katniss Everdeen volunteered to take the place of her younger sister, and she also happens to be a cool chick and a brilliant archer. There's quite a lot of additional blah blah and uninteresting sub plots, but I will admit that ""The Hunger Games"" contains a handful of impressive action sequences in the jungle and even a few shocking moments in spite of its PG-13 rating. The apotheosis is utterly weak, which is inevitably I suppose, and the use of computer-engineered effects (the mutated dog- pack attack, for example) is terribly annoying, but perhaps this is all linked to me being a sourpuss. As for the remaining installments in the series, I will patiently wait until they get aired on TV as well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Biblical opinions on the Hunger Games,"Overall, I think the Hunger Games was an intense but enjoyable movie. I have not read the books however from the summaries I can conclude a few things. First of all, Collins has written this series of books that keeps all ages alike interested. I think Collins has taught kids the consequences of our beliefs. She raises serious questions about our culture and violence and what it does to the hearts and minds of the younger generation. There have been a few people that I know personally and from what I have read that complained about the violence, not because there is violence, rather there wasn't enough. The violence seems to show past things that happened in history; for example, the Coliseum with the persecution of Christians. Children today are attending government schools and learning that man can save man. However, as a Christian, I know that's not the case. Socialism seems to play a major role. Another topic that I'm not sure if Collins knew or not, but she incorporated the idea of total depravity. Total depravity is the idea that no one is innocent and everyone is in need or redemption. (Romans 3:9-18) Collins added a few ideas into her books in order to make the readers think. The Hunger Games was a good movie, if you can get over the idea of kids killing kids. I know a biblical world view has nothing to do with The Hunger Games; however Collins placed a few ideas such as consequences for your beliefs, what violence does to the heart and mind, and a huge idea of total depravity throughout her books.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good film...,"First of all, as someone else said in a review, I still make of point of surfing through IMDb before watching a film in the hopes of knowing whether it's worth watching it or if I should stick to waiting for a DVD version of some sort.True, the scoring is not at all bad here on IMDb but then come the reviews... the first 15 or so rating the film very poorly, claiming 'twas the new Twilight saga or a rip-off of Battle Royale. If you've read these reviews, take them with a hint of salt.Granted this is pretty much setting itself to be the next money-making Hollywoodesque saga. It has a lot of the usual elements that get teenage groups to fall in love with the franchise, throwing their money - and tear-jerking awe's - its way. That doesn't necessarily make it a bad film.As for the comparison to Battle Royale, I'd much rather, if feeling the need to compare this to something else, compare it with The Gladiator - fighters from whatever part of a given world, mostly poor or slaves, are pitted against each other in an arena of death. Ring a bell? In fact, human nature, human history... humans in general, were definitely the inspiration for this story. Comparing this to Battle Royale is the equivalent to comparing 1984, a Brave New World and The Trial because of their descriptions of a ""future dystopian society"" - for anyone who's read them, you'll know how impossible this comparison is.To wrap it up, go watch this film. I was expecting little and came out well impressed, if not a bit disappointed about how people are analyzing stuff these days. I'm a huge film and book fan, I watch films on a daily basis (being quite picky and critic of most of the stuff Hollywood sends out this way) and also read plenty of books, and I would find it very hard to compare the two franchises, BR and Hunger Games, let alone call the latter a ripoff of the former.Please, please, please, just stop reading stuff online before watching a film if you know it will bias your opinion... You'll have a better time at the movies and you'll be thinking about them by yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Workable action film, which burns its way to some involving content involving characters we like and social commentary","What I admired most about ""The Hunger Games"" was how it managed to resist the temptation to leap into the second unit material straight away - a misstep so many films of this genre, especially those geared towards the same demographics as this one is, have done so. Instead, ""The Hunger Games"" earns the right to 'go there', so to speak - taking its time to establish character and situation. What I also appreciated was its subtext to do with violence and entertainment; de-sensitisation and trivialisation, and more broadly how governments are able to utilise such things to control populations.Jennifer Lawrence plays the rather conspicuously named Katniss Everdeen, a young woman living somewhere in a North America which has gone to the dogs through war and now suffers life under a totalitarian regime in the far-future. Where she lives, the equally conspicuously named Panem, possesses in its constitution a highly questionable law which dictates that, every year, one male and one female between the ages of 12 and 19 from each of the country's dozen or so districts must face off to the bloody death in a large gamezone carved out of the forests in what are the eponymous 'hunger games'.The reasons for this brutal regulation pertain to the dictatorial government wanting to keep up the traditions of honour and willpower synonymous with its national identity, but these days everybody largely agrees it is down to the sheer fact that said contest makes for damn good television. Questions pertaining to how old the nation is and what they did before television was invented are not answered...As a character, Everdeen is nobody special - nobody in Panem is, because the grip the rulers have on the country keeps anybody from broadening out too far into becoming anything at all. She maintains her friendships; lives in her rudimentary village; takes care of her younger sister and spends enough time fooling around with a bow and arrow to become a bit of a crack-shot. Will the skill come to benefit her later on in the tale?Disaster strikes when, through reasons I will leave unspoilt, Everdeen winds up appearing in the yearly contest having been selected as the female to represent her district. This plunges Lawrence's character into a whole new world of colour; energy and fame, not to mention life-threatening danger on account of having to do battle with a motley group of compatriots from the other districts which range from robust, muscular black males on the very brink of being too old to compete to mousey younger girls too young to possess any real clue as to what is even happening.""The Hunger Games"" is not an especially exhilarating character piece, but it does do the basics required of both the action and horror (and, in part, romance) genres especially well. The film is an energetic post-modern fusion of all sorts of things ranging from ""Predator"" to ""TRON"" by way of the 2000 Japanese film, to which it seems to owe its greatest debt, ""Battle Royale"".It allows its premise and the sheer scope afforded to it in terms of whatever content it might possess to make a scathing attack on modern American (even Western) free-market consumer entertainment. This is unsubtly presented to us for the first time quite early on when one character quips about the contest that ""...if no one watched (on TV), they (the government) wouldn't do it"", eventually becoming a film depicting a society with a violent, deranged spectacle at the very core of its identity.Indeed, while nothing in the world (that we know of) can quite match the barbarity of what Gary Ross' film depicts here, we should be aware by now that WWE is adored by millions; heavyweight championship boxing matches can make billionaires out of its participants in one evening and that some of the highest grossing films of all time are action (or violence) packed blockbusters.This begs the question: how do WE - the film-going audience - react to the violent action when it finally starts? Are we entertained? Do we fall into the trap of rooting for a character because we want them to succeed? Is it not too often the case that the target audience for the film roll from multiplex screening to multiplex screening absorbing the latest actioner?By the time the ""Games"" themselves have begun, the film has earned the right to take us to where we go. To complain that they are episodic, and that the set-pieces & killings might happen in any order, seems silly, but the best action films have always had a sense of grace and timing to their second unit sequences as events unfold around their characters: ""Terminator2"" and ""Jurassic Park"" might be two good examples from recent history.The screenplay possesses very little of any terrific profundity, while the lead's taking in under her wing of a fellow female contestant far too young to survive on her own merely proves what we already knew: she is a good older sister - a more affecting arc may have been to establish her earlier as a bully to her sibling and have her return much kinder. Irrespective, there is enough in ""The Hunger Games"" to get stuck into and enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Kids killing kids - a worthy theme?,"I wasn't going to see with this and I kind of wish I hadn't. It's hard to believe this is the next Big Thing, after Harry Potter and the TWILIGHT series. Stanley Tucci, hosting the TV reality show in which kids hunt each other to extinction, combines everything you hate about Simon Cowell with everything you hate about Louis Walsh! Jennifer Lawrence occasionally has the arresting beauty of the young Elizabeth Taylor.Even if you haven't read the books on which this highly-publicised series is based, it's fairly obvious from the start who's going to survive and who isn't. A thin storyline doesn't really justify stretching the film well beyond two hours. The ending suggests that creepy President Sutherland (Donald, not Keifer, looking like a throwback to Abe Lincoln) has got some more gruelling games up his sleeve for Volume Two. Don't think I'll bother.The killing scenes - knifings, bludgeonings and arrows-through-the-heart - are not too excessively detailed, but there's no escaping the fact that this a movie about kids killing kids. Leaving aside the obvious borrowings from RAMBO, THE RUNNING MAN and PREDATOR, this is a disturbing theme for a movie to emerge from the country that went through Columbine and other high-school and college massacres. And it's especially disturbing to be watching it in the week when a Norwegian right-wing lunatic is on trial for murdering several dozen students.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Seriously though the major thing is just to read the book before seeing it and I guarantee you would find the book much more entertaining.

Mixed reviews depending knowledge of the story,"My family went to see the movie yesterday and came home with mixed reviews. Of the five of us, three have read the books, one is reading them and one has no interest in reading them. Accordingly, those of us who have read/are reading the books, understood the movie. The one who has no frame of reference for the story, hated the movie. He found it choppy, disjointed, shallow and had a hard time following the storyline. And the extreme use of the hand held/shaky camera style gave him a headache.For myself, I enjoyed the books but found the movie to be unsatisfying...which is no shock. It's usually that way when they take a well known story and make it into a movie. Especially one told in the first person. Without knowing what was going on in her mind (despite Jennifer Lawrence trying to convey as much as possible with her eyes/facial expressions) it's difficult to fully understand the storyline. My personal issue was that it made Katniss look as though she just jumped from one guy to the other...kind of made her seem skanky & shallow.The timing also felt a bit off...like the first 2/3 of the movie was leading up to the arena and then the rest was really rushed. There is no time given to the cave and all that happens in that part of the story. I agree with the other reviewer who felt that the movie was basically a synopsis of the book...it was like watching a really shaky Cliff Notes.I think Jennifer Lawrence carries the movie as the acting by the two male leads wasn't that great. Woody Harrelson is great as Haymitch but its written as such a small role.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Exceptional,When I first read the cast list I was slightly disappointed; however after watching the film my opinions have all changed. The right people were certainly assigned the right roles and because of this a convincing and engaging performance was delivered. Josh Hutchersons portrayal of Peeta Mellark was heartwarming enough to make me warm to a character that I despised throughout the book trilogy - which is something that does not happen often.The special effects looked for the most part real and the costumes (bar one of two outfits) were beautifully designed and suited both the setting and the character.Dialogue was well thought out and kept me hooked throughout the entire 2 hours and 40 minutes. The characters were so well distinguished and varied that you'd be hard pushed not to find a character that you identify with making parts of the film very personal.Really the only problem I have is that some of the scenes strayed from the original story - which shouldn't have happened with the author writing the script. The opening is slow to start and it is only when the tributes reach the Capitol that you feel the pace liven.This is one of the few book adaptations that has actually worked and well worth the ticket fare. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and am waiting in anticipation for the sequel.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Survivalist Adventure with Satirical Reality TV Sensibilities Benefits from Lawrence's Star Turn,"Among indie-film aficionados, 21-year-old Jennifer Lawrence has lent an impressive-for-her-years gravitas to a diverse array of roles in Guillermo Arriaga's ""The Burning Plain"" (2008), Drake Doremus's ""Like Crazy"" (2011), and most memorably, Debra Granik's ""Winter's Bone"" (2010). She showed up as Mystique, one of the ""X-Men: First Class"" in the big-budget 2011 actioner last year, but it was her role as resourceful backwoods survivor Ree Dolly in ""Winter's Bone"" that appears to be the direct descendant of the heroine in this 2012 adrenalin rush of a movie - Katniss Everdeen, just sixteen but an expert archer living in District 12, the poorest of the dozen civilian sectors that make up the future state of Panem. Based on Suzanne Collins' hugely popular young-adult trilogy, Katniss' story is enmeshed in a dystopian society ruled by an unforgiving government seeking to provide penance to its downtrodden citizens through annual televised, ""Survivor""-like bloodletting sports which give the movie its provocative title. Each event requires two ""tributes"" from each district, a boy and a girl, who must participate in a winner--takes-all survivalist match which means a likely violent death for the 23 others who must lose in the process.This gory concept is leavened by new-to-the genre Gary Ross' (""Seabiscuit"") surprisingly humanistic direction; a sometimes shrewd, sometimes silly screenplay by Ross, Collins and Billy Ray (""Shattered Glass""); and a sharp cast combining the faces and fit bodies of young Hollywood with veterans who don't appear to be taking the proceedings too seriously. It's over 2 1/2 hours long, so the pacing has to be quicksilver, and Ross manages to keep the momentum up for most of the story. In the introductory sequence, District 12 is represented as a tableau of Dorothea Lange-style images reminiscent of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl in ""The Grapes of Wrath"". Katniss lives with her passive mother and worshipful younger sister Prim. As fate would have it, Prim is chosen out of a raffle-like fishbowl to be the district ""tribute"" at which point Katniss unhesitantly volunteers to take her place. She is paired up with an oppressed baker's son named Peeta, who is more than willing to play by the rules to win the game. They are whisked off to the Capitol where along with the rest of the ""tributes"", they are groomed and trained in a style akin to ""American Idol"". This part of the movie is more predictably entertaining given the sly, satirical jabs at current reality-TV programming.Once the games finally begin in the forest, it becomes more of a standard adventure action yarn albeit with some clever twists that recall scenes from Peter Weir's underrated ""The Truman Show"". However, the events start to feel by-the-numbers as the ""tributes"" meet their inevitable fates in orderly succession. Give Ross credit for not belaboring the violent elements in order to maintain the film's PG-13 rating. What I liked most about this part of the film was not so much the burgeoning relationship between Katniss and Peeta (which feels a bit more emotionally removed perhaps due to what may be coming in the sequels) but the poignant connection between Katniss and young Rue, which culminates into the film's most moving moments. Less effective are the hand-held camera-work by Tom Stern and the agitated editing by Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling, both elements making it sometimes difficult to figure out what is going on at any given moment. Moreover, the movie loses whatever social consciousness it had at the beginning save for one racially motivated scene of violence. In spite of these flaws, Lawrence gives the movie a much-needed soul as she drives the film's fanciful narrative through her stoic yet penetrating nature.Josh Hutcherson (""The Kids Are All Right"") doesn't make as vivid an impression as Peeta but handles the role serviceably, while it seems fairly obvious Liam Hemsworth's curtailed role as Gale, the smitten boy Katniss leaves behind, will be more prominent in the sequel. Among the ""tributes"", Amandla Stenberg shines brightest in the spotlight role of Rue. More exaggerated turns are provided by Woody Harrelson as drunken mentor Haymitch Abernathy, Elizabeth Banks as garishly garbed escort Effie Trinket, and Stanley Tucci as preening blue-haired emcee Caesar Flickerman, a Ryan Seacrest-doppelganger. Relatively more subtle are Lenny Kravitz (complete with gold eyeliner) as Katniss' compassionate stylist Cinna, Wes Bentley (""American Beauty"") as sinister show producer Seneca Crane, and a lionized Donald Sutherland as the President. Production designer Philip Messina and costume designer Judianna Makovsky deserve kudos, even though Katniss's flaming-red (literally) evening gown was underwhelming. For such an obvious franchise, the film manages to entertain for most of its running time, even if parts feel quite derivative of other films like ""The Running Man"" and even ancient relics like ""The Most Dangerous Game"". It's a pretty effective start to the trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Epicly uninspired movie making,"The main problem with this movie is that you need to have read the book to be invested in the ludicrous premise and any of the woefully thinly drawn characters in the movie. Without the context of the book the whole premise of the movie is basically a big ""WTF"". A better script/director could have overcome this limitation to an extent - some of the Harry Potters managed to stand up OK as standalone movies (although not many of them to be fair). Of course, the tone of the movie is *deadly* serious telling me that I'm supposed to care about these 'characters' and the ridiculous predicament they find themselves in. Maybe I would if I'd read the book...The ludicrous premise could also have been mitigated by making the attendant violence compelling - after all the premise is that the masses are entertained by the butchery right ? Which leads into the other major problem with the movie. The violence is completely neutered in order to achieve the necessary PG-13 rating to ensure mass consumption and make as much money as possible. As many people have commented, the build up to the titular 'Hunger Games' took a fair while (all without establishing why the Hunger Games made sense at all). Once the games finally arrive I thought 'OK now for at least some good action'. Unfortunately what I got was an incoherent mess full of ridiculously quick cuts so as to avoid seeing any bloodshed at all. Where's the tension and excitement in watching completely incoherent action sequences ? There is none. I guess it must have been exciting in the book...A lesser problem is the special effects (the flames and the CGI dogs in particular) which are very poor and obviously done on the cheap. The girl on fire scene was laughable to me although I got the distinct impression it was supposed to be a big dramatic scene. I'm sure it must have been in the book...",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Repulsively Ridiculous,"In a dystopian future, the government picks youngsters to engage in a fight to death. The premise of the film and the source novel is repulsively ridiculous.

What kind of society gets its entertainment by watching children kill each other? What point is being made here? If one looks past the silly and disturbing premise, however, it is an entertaining action film for the most part.

The brutality and primal cheering of the masses bring to mind the Roman matches to the death in the Colosseum. And the superstitions implied (that such a thing would actually work) made me think of the story (and movie) by Shirley Jackson, ""The Lottery.""The main character is a young woman already equipped with survival skills. She is the female representative from District 12, and in all there are 24 combatants, a male and a female from each of the dozen districts. Yes, it's eventually a bloody awful affair. In fact, the first half of the movie, before the battles, is the best. It introduces the whole idea, including the pomp and circumstance, the game show atmosphere, and behind-the-scenes primping and strategizing. Stanley Tucci is the host of the show, the Hunger Games as they are called, and he's wonderfully nutty. Woody Harrelson is a jaded and unconventional tutor (and former games winner) for the District 12 pair. And Lenny Kravitz plays an attractive smart stage manager and morale booster.Dominating in every way is Jennifer Lawrence, who is a good reluctant strong participant. How long she survives you'll have to see for yourself--that's part of the game--but it's how she survives that matters, and how she becomes the target of some of the other ""tributes"" (as they are called, since the youngsters are bloody sacrifices for peace, ultimately). The scenario is great stuff, the sets and filming and pace of it really first rate. In many ways it's a terrific movie, and it's making billions at the box office for good reasons.The second half of the film is the grand battle. It amounts mostly a series of encounters between various ""tributes,"" a dwindling number of course. Members of the television audience worldwide are cheering for their own districts to win, and cameras seem to be everywhere. In fact, the control room of the ""world"" makes clear it's a lot like ""The Truman Show"" with complete mastery over the elements, the sun, and even invented fires and other threats. (It was all filmed in North Carolina, by the way.)If you like logic to your ritual barbarism, you'll have to look the other way now and then. Our heroine is singled out for some extra terrors, a bit unfairly, and then avoids other sure death situations by inexplicable kindness or little goodies floated in on metal parachutes. And those ultra-lethal genetically modified wasps? They don't live up to their billing. And why do some giant dog cyber-beasts suddenly attack our heroes and not anyone else?Nitpicking? Only maybe. There were some avoidable gaffes like this, and it's the director (Gary Ross) who is also the writer who needs to shoulder a little blame there. Or can we eventually attribute some of the limitations here to the young adult novel that forms the basis to it all. There is some background buzz about the movie because of supposed racist and feminist issues one way or another, and I think there is room for argument there because the ""types"" used in the movie are in fact stereotypes. Some small effort at surprising the audience with better casting would have avoided the criticism and made a better movie. (The wikipedia entry for this movie is stunningly long. Check it out.)In some ways this is nearly a 10 star movie. It's that good. But it's really too long overall, especially the second half which revels in some pretty basic hunt and kill violence. And there are some cracks in the veneer that drag the whole thing down to simply a fun, inventive, interesting futurist drama. That's good enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent film,"Personally, I wasn't too excited about this film when I first heard that it was coming out as I had never read any of the books or even heard of it before now. However I ended up going anyway and it was a really good film although upsetting in some places but this was a vital part of the storyline and it worked well cinematically. I would definitely recommend this film to any one but in the audience were children about 9 years old with their parents and they were clearly effected by it so I wouldn't recommend any parent to take young children as the certificate already advises. The acting was brilliant especially Jennifer Lawerence who was very convincing with the hardships that her character has to go through.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good movie. Bad camera work,"this was a good movie with a good plot. The two main actors were surprisingly good.The movie shows a stark difference between the poverty of District 12 and the technology and cleanliness and prosperity of the Capitol.I think the time during the games could have been longer with more survival and conflict scenes. It seems like the actual games/competition went by awfully fast.But, overall I enjoyed it.EXCEPT: way too much use of the unstabilized shaky hand camera. My eyes hurt by the time the movie was over. This is what will keep me from watching again on the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid start for this trilogy,"Having read the books, I wasn't sure how they would capture this dystopian adventure on film. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie does a nice job of setting up the back-story and history leading up to the Hunger Games themselves. I thought that the casting was on the spot and Jennifer Lawrence captures the depth and strength of our heroine Katniss with aplomb. The book had a fairly dense storyline, so there are always sacrifices that must be made in bringing it to film. However, the story hits the high points well. While it's a little slow out of the gate, it finishes strong. If I had to offer a criticism, it would be the lack of emotional depth in some scenes, which too often was sacrificed to the momentum of the story. I expect that the coming 2nd film will be the real highlight of this series as the book was packed with action.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Action scenes,"Hello. I am from Indonesia. I don't know in another country but in Indonesia, many scenes is censored ( or maybe many scenes in movies is cut for MPAA PG - 13 rating). For example murder scenes. I can't see clearly the action because many scenes is censored. I am not ""SAW"" fans or gores movies or similar movies but i can't feel the tension about how to survive, how to not killed by others if many scenes is censored. I want the feeling, the tension like movie ""the dark knight"". It is not gore movies but it is not ""soft"" movies too. The violence is good enough for feel the tension. So that is my review. Sorry if my English is not good enough",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Slow and predictable,"It goes unsaid that the book is almost always better than the film. This movie is unique in the fact that it is much worse than the book. I'm not a fan of the latest fad of teen literature to begin with, but being a science fiction fan and a lover of the movie Battle Royale, I had high hopes for this. The word ""hype"" doesn't even begin to summarize how much attention and praise this movie has received, and it definitely did not deliver. The lead actress was great and the idea of a bleak future landscape separated into districts to keep the population in check is a great story. But the film didn't tell that story well. We get only flashes of how or why this system game into place or what the ""hunger games"" purpose actually is. It was very slow, very predictable even if you hadn't read the book and had virtually no action. The fight scenes it did have were quick flashes that if combined total two or so minutes of the movie. And don't get me started on the awful CGI of the ""killer dogs"" at the end.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I couldn't have done any better... 5/10 ?!,"This review is from a 26 year old who has read the book.I don't want to seem to jump on the band waggon of people who say's ""its not as good as the book"" as this was going to be guaranteed.Therefore, I will start with the good. Well, one good point really. I think all the readers can agree that Katniss is a very complicated character to play, with multitude of emotions. And I think that Jennifer Lawrence did a good job, considering screenplay she had to work with. This is probably the main positive of the movie.Now the negatives. For me (personally), the lack of gore and fighting (and hence making it a 12A instead of a 15) wasn't the problem. I didn't like the book because of the gore. I liked the book because it made me feel happy, sad, anger and compassion at different times. It made me care about the characters and what happened to them... how a good book should. This is where the movie failed for me. After asking my friends about the movie (who haven't read the book), they said that they found that they didn't care about the characters during the movie, whether if they died or survived. I think this hits the nail on the head.A book can achieve a connection between the reader and the characters by creating depth to the characters and more importantly richness of the relationships between characters. By doing this, the reader can relate to the internal feelings of the characters at major situations throughout the book. Hence, the reader will find themselves wanting good things to happen to the main characters such as Katniss and Peeta, and feel emotional pain when bad things happen to them. But this takes pages and pages of emotive descriptions, which is hard to portray on screen. Therefore, the writers had to balance between the depths of characters/relationships with the breadth of storyline within the given time frame, which was probably by far the biggest hurdle. This is where I sympathise with the screen writers. The movie was already 2 hours and 20 minutes long. It would over have to be a lot longer to do achieve this balance. But, obviously that is way too long for a movie. Therefore, as a movie this was destined to fail... maybe as a TV series where there is more time to develop this connection with the characters could have worked better. Who knows?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
But it could have been so easily 10,"First of all I have to say that I haven't read the hunger games, a friend told me that the movie just had a few changes but it would sum up the book pretty good.Well I gonna start with the good things: The characters and actors. I was impressed by the between teen and adult actors they were really good, I felt really connected to each of them which is also because their characters were written very well it's great to see that the author obviously treats his audience/readers seriously and knows how to write clever teenagers who aren't just cardboard cutouts. Next the camera-work is pretty good although there is a lot of shaky cam, the length and the way the suspense is build up with it's sort of two half's was really great sort of a Kubrick like and overall I liked the idea But with the idea and story were my problems. Now keep in mind I haven't read the book and i didn't want my friends to tell me anything from the book so that I can only understand this universe by the movie and I think thats were some people gonna have the same complains as I have.*I'm not gonna spoil anything, but give a short version of the beginning* First of all these are the 74th Hunger-Games is seriously anyone telling me that this ending NO SPOILER has never happened in 74 years? I mean these are still humans I just cant comprehend the fact that for over 74 years these hunger games happened just as they were planed without any problems caused by the competitors. Second these games *again no real spoiler but a basic info* as I understood were made to prevent a war of the districts. Exactly how is a tournament of kids from 12-18 going to prevent a war rather then forcing people to get mad at the government and system who made this happen? In the book its probably explained but again in the movie it stays as a plot hole, at least for me. There is also a little problem that would require me to spoil something but I think a review doesn't need spoilers to explain my thoughts.All in all its a nice movie, definitely watchable and for smart teenagers a must see but in the end I feel like I really have to read the book in order to understand the world this story takes place in and thats kind of sad because with Harry Potter I could leave the books aside and enjoy the movies for what they are without feeling betrayed, with Hunger Games I know that I cant understand this universe enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This film has a hell of a lot of potential,"I was very excited to watch this film though i haven't read the series of books,the hype and just the concept of the story, had me intrigued many months before the film was shown in cinemas.The film it's self, was a little too long for my liking with a few too many dull moments than i was expecting. I think the film could've been cut quite a lot shorter which could of made it more exciting and effective, because a lot of the film focuses on the run up to 'The Hunger Games' i would've liked to see more effort put into the filming of the actual competition.With a few of the bad points out of the way, here come the good points: I still think that the story is an absolutely brilliant idea though it wasn't used to it's full potential in the instance it didn't really matter to me because i loved the concept so much. The acting is brilliant throughout, i especially loved the little girls acting, she was such a lovable character, i almost shed a tear at a certain part of the film which i wont mention due to spoilers. The characters in this film are great all together in my opinion, the costumes are incredible and it's just unusual and quirky i think that's what sold the film to me in the end.This film is definitely worth a watch, though i didn't walk out of the cinema feeling refreshed, i put that down to me having impeccably high expectations for this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
good enough to justify franchise,"Based on popular books, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided between 12 districts and the Capitol. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. 24 enters 1 leaves. When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She is an underdog against other participants who have trained for this their whole lives.Other than Jennifer Lawrence, there isn't much to write home about. The scale of the movie barely big enough. The action isn't that brutal. The artistic style is a mishmash. Some of the important people have fanciful hair but are they truly original? I haven't read the books and after watching this, I don't intend to. By comparison, I eventually broke down and read the Harry Potter books after watching the 3rd movie. To be honest, I don't know what the big deal is. It's good enough to justify the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but missing a lot","I read the first ""Hunger Games"" book a few months back, and really enjoyed it. Today, I saw the movie.I thought it was pretty good, but not great. It REALLY needed another 20 minutes or so during the actual Games. Many characters that are quite important in the book (especially Rue and Cato), are barely shown in the movie, and give us little or no reason to care about them.A big chunk of the movie was the lead-up to the actual Games. I understand there was a lot to get through, especially for people unfamiliar with the book, but it took too much time away from the actual premise of the movie.I will give the director solid props for conveying just how much the people were afraid of being selected to compete, and Jennifer Lawrence's scene (as Katniss) right before going up the tube was extremely well done. She's a fantastic actor.In fact, almost all of the actors were great. The only one I thought was kinda average was Peeta, and I think that had more to do with his voice tone than anything. Still, he did a good job overall.The main bad guy (Cato) in the book was not even much of a presence on screen. The knife girl did a better job showing that she was dangerous. The big black kid was probably on screen less than two minutes, and he was a major concern during the Games as well.Again, Rue was REALLY not done well. I blame this on the editor. The actress did fine, but the movie just plain didn't show why she was so important to Katniss. Her character should have had at least five more minutes of screen time just to explain their bond.The finishing scenes were decent, but the very end was ambiguous, at best, for anyone who hasn't read the book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Engaging Story,"I was unaware that this movie was based off a book until I came on IMDb to review. As a movie first viewer, I have to say the film was quite entertaining. I watched the late late show when I should have been sleeping and the movie kept me up and engaged the entire time. I was expecting from the trailers for a bit of cheese due to the lead character looking like the girl from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I was pleasantly surprised that the characters and acting were not half bad, and that the story was in fact quite fresh. I have read that this is the first book of 3, and I noticed the characters were built and left with some hanging conflict. I have to agree with another reviewer about the camera work. The use of hand-held cameras was appropriate some of the time, but there was just too much of it. It was jarring to the eye and distracted me from time to time. I got a bit confused in the fight scenes, because I could never tell who was hitting who. Some shots could have definitely benefited from a locked off tripod, or a steady cam. My goal in every movie is to get lost in it, not confused by it. Overall, this was an awesome film and I look forward to the sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
OK at best,"This could have been an AMAZING movie, but the cinematography was so jittery and unstable that I found myself being completely pulled out of the story to hate the experience. Steady-cam or Warp Stabilizer would have done wonders for this film, but half the movie was either out of focus or all over the place. Especially the ending battle scene- we couldn't make out who was who, or even if it was a person involved in the fight.I live for the movie experience - and I knew in the first 20 minutes I would not be buying this to add to my library (and I have almost 2,000 titles).Maybe the next one will be shot better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The First Blockbuster of the Year!,"The Hunger Games is as straightforward as book adaptations get. Nearly every scene is taken word from word for the page, and while some things obviously have to be left out in the interest of time, watching the movie is incredibly close to the experience of reading the novel.And in this case that's a very good thing, because The Hunger Games is a great book and makes for a great movie. The tone is spot-on, be it the frivolous, manic environment of the Capitol (the ruling city of the future post-war remains of America and yearly organizer of the Hunger Games), the unflinching poverty of District 12 (home of our main character and several other people important to the overall story), or the brutality of the games themselves. Nothing featuring children killing each other should be easy to watch, and the PG-13 rating doesn't stop several scenes from being wince inducing. The violence is never really glorified or lingered on, but it's there.I loved Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. Any concerns I had about her being a little older than the character or too ""healthy"" looking were quickly forgotten. Katniss is defined by her determination and resourcefulness, and Lawrence nailed that. I also was pleasantly surprised by how well most of rest of the cast embodies their characters, including Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, who actually made me like the character in the movie more than the book. Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Woody Harrleson as Haymitch, and Wes Bentley as Seneca Crane all help bring the world to life by handling their characters so well. Even the actors playing the other contestants in the games managed to be memorable and show the essence of their characters, no matter how brief their scenes are.If you're a fan of the books, put your worries aside. This is The Hunger Games you know and love on the big screen, and it's done well. If you're new to the franchise, just know you're in for a thrilling, often brutal, and occasionally touching story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I left not really caring,"Let me start by saying I never review anything.I went into this movie wanting it to be more then it was. I wonder if it will take all three movies together to get some of the impact that came from the books? I left the book series with the hunger for the revolution. The revolution that improved the social injustices bestowed on the poor souls of Pannam. Feeling sad for how broken Kat and the others were etc. I left this first movie wanting the bathroom and that's about it. This movie lacked character development. People have defended this with statements like there just wasn't enough time. I don't buy that and here is an example of why.If you saw the movie Star Ship Troopers a ""B"" movie if ever there was one you end up caring a little at least about what happens to some of the characters.To be honest I really didn't care what happened to any of the charters in this movie. I might have cared about Peetta more if I could have stopped confusing him with Cato. I almost cared about Rue, I wanted to but it just never developed.All in all this was just an OK post-apocalyptic movie somewhere in-between Mad Max and The Postman (another book the movie failed to translate). I hope they get another director for the Catching Fire because this story deserves a lot more effort. Some have said they enjoyed it much more the second time. I may put this to the test because I really wanted this movie to succeed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Wow.  The worst thing I've sat through in years, if not ever.","The movie establishes nothing. No character development, no real plot of interest, no reason to exist. This type of futuristic fight to the death movie has been done so many times already and each one much better than this. It wasn't even visually appealing and makes Roger Corman's ""Death Race"" look like a genius and insightful social commentary.Sure, some may say that you had to read the book to enjoy the movie. But you know what, I didn't read Gone with the Wind either and that made complete sense and was highly entertaining. Why? Because they included pertinent information from the book to establish a reason for the viewer to care about the people on the screen. This piece of drivel was void of that entirely.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Did they take the rights of the Japanese thriller 'BATTLE ROYALE' or just copied it shamelessly as per modern Hollywood's tradition?,"With The Hunger Games, the decade old tradition of Hollywood continues, taking it all (from the first frame to the last) from an engrossingly well made Japanese Thriller called ""BATTLE ROYALE"" released in 2000.In short, the director and his writer take 90% ingredients for their over-cooked script from the Japanese Film. Then they add a love-sex angle to it as a mandatory clause of Twilightesque Film-making technique. To make it more spicier, they bring in some eunuch characters into the narration with the get-up earlier used in their own films. And further, sprinkling it with a few emotional sequences about some broken families, they are ready with their latest flick The Hunger Games, taking advantage of the brand name.As I have realised, many of my reader friends here would like to say that, ""We don't really care if it's a copy or not, so cut out the allegation crap and just let us know whether the movie is good or bad and that's it."" In answer to that I would only like to say that The Hunger Games is an Open Creative Theft made by the Collis camp in this current age of world-wide- web. Now, a theft remains a theft, whether done carelessly or with utmost care and devotion. Even if it happens to be a too good movie (which fortunately it isn't), still it remains a Shameless Robbery of any other person's creative work and nothing else. And I am simply not interested in writing a detailed review of a copied movie.However, for all my friendly readers, who are willing to know more about Cinema in details, I would like to present this movie as a fine lesson in learning few important things about Hollywood Film-making style.1. Hollywood film-maker's biggest problem is that we still are not sure of what genre we are dealing in while making a film. The current The Hunger Games copies a fast paced cruel bloody Japanese thriller ""BATTLE ROYALE"" , it's a Bloody Suspense Thriller and it remains a bloody suspense thriller throughout.But The Hunger Games not even remains a thriller in its more than 2 hours of duration. There is an added track in it of a beautiful model girl who is in love with the hero as Love essentially has to be there like sugar or salt in a dish. There are many unwanted eunuchs and unmoving stories of broken families inserted into it which were not required at all. The soundtrack has surprisingly all love songs in a SCIFI THRILLER movie like a variety served on the dinner table by its makers.2. Secondly in this new age of fresh creative minds, we still follow double standards in showing the characters of our male and female leads. Now in the original flick the lead character or the hero is not a female. But in our Tweenie version the hero becomes a strong female character. So the writers give a certain amount of disrespect to the very source they are copying from directly.But on the other hand The Hunger Games has a sexy-model beefcake characters played by eunuchs, who simply have no definite role in the movie but is added only to be exploited as a male butt rump.That's the double standard mind-set Hollywood actually works in.3. Thirdly after watching both the movies, you will have a clear idea of what it means by the term ""Added Sub Plots"" which in most of the cases ruin the real essence of a film. In this case too, where the original keeps walking on a single track and never gets distracted from its basic storyline of BATTLE ROYALE, its USA copy keeps wandering between its various added subplots which could have been easily avoided. Frankly speaking we can't even stick to a basic storyline even when its all copied from another brilliant source.4. Lastly and more importantly, if you even copy the idea for the Poster of your film along with its script then I wonder what the whole team actually may have done as far as creativity is concerned in this project. Here the makers of The Hunger Games not only copy their whole film from the Japanese Original scene to scene, but they also copy their posters. Now that's really a great amount of research done by the team.Summing up, with The Hunger Games, the Gary Ross camp continues to try for their next box office success in American Cinema by taking the credit of all the hard work done by someone else residing in a different part of the globe far awayand they have really mastered this shameful act of ""Art of Inspiration"" by now. (However, I would love to be surprised with the impossible news that they actually did buy the rights this time.)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Jennifer Lawrence was born to play Katniss.,"When the wonderful Jennifer Lawrence was cast in the much coveted role of Katniss Everdeen there was a lot of uproar from devoted fans of the novels on which this film is based, I however think that she is perfectly cast. From the early images which surfaced online all the way to the trailer and the final poster I thought she looked the part, and after seeing the final film it's safe to say she nails every facet of this wonderful character. Miss Lawrence is a supremely talented young actress and it's great to see someone with mega talent being rewarded by getting the big roles. She just absolutely nails it as Katniss, from the emotional side to the violent tough side, she is the character.The movie itself is a fine adaptation, all the best parts of the book are present and accounted for, a few bit and pieces have been omitted but it doesn't affect it majorly, the beginning of the story is set in a barren land known as district 12 and it is presented exactly how I imagined it, this chapter is only slight though which is really the only disappointment, i would have liked to see a bit more of that but oh well, the middle part of the story is hilarious with Stanley Tucci stealing every scene, again the eccentric Capitol is presented in great detail, again exactly the way I had imagined it while reading the books. And finally the third act, the one every has waited for is a truly action packed adventure, it's non stop action and you don't fare tear your eyes away even for a second.The romance element is very very slight and not overdone thankfully, I'm glad they didn't over do that, the rest of the cast are mostly great, Josh Hutcherson is nice to watch and you care about him just as much as you do Katniss, and Elizabeth Banks like Stanley Tucci is a scene stealer and great comic relief.All in all the film is excellent, a great book has been treated with care and it's paid off, fans of the book and just general movie goers will love it.

A Parable for Our Times?,"Taking my cue from sensible film critic Roger Ebert, I will read the movie as a parable and take from it what I want. A parable that must resonate for teenagers indeed... since the film's 24 participants must be 12 to 18 years in order to qualify for the deadly competition that will leave 23 of them dead. A parable with manipulative and controlling adults taking their disproportionate pleasure from contests that children play on the little league fields, soccer fields and basketball courts of the USA... as in the hungry arena of fictional Panera. And what percentage will make it to the big time college circuit and then on to the pros? A game seen by teenagers as set up by controlling adults so as to produce one winner and twenty three losers: that is, one Ivy League acceptance for every twenty four applications in the annual American college admissions contest. Cut throat (oh so literally in the movie) competition over grades, honors, external recognitions. The big question in the viewers' final ten minutes of the film is... can the teenagers turn the tables on the adult leaders, outwit the system, and survive? Avoiding a spoiler...I let the question stand. Seven stars, not ten...a few too many internal inconsistencies left unexplained, but surely a question-raiser of a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely amazing.,"Absolutely great movie. I just love it. Honestly, I didn't know a lot of about the storyline of the saga and normally did not expected much from the movie as well. But I was very surprised that actually the idea is very relevant with the contemporary problems and the global politic streams. We all see what happens with ACTA, MACTa and another shits and if you actually understand the main idea of the movie and taste the sustainable environment definitely you'll be a disgust from the situations around you and the globalization of the sustainable internet society.Finally, I would like just to mention that I already bought the three books and currently I am so pleased from the style, drama and storyline. I cannot wait for the next chapter on the wide screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's difficult...,"(I've tried to make this short review spoiler-free, so I hope I don't give anything away!)Contrary to the many negative reviews on this page, I actually found the film quite delectable. I did not even notice the shaking camera that much, though I'm not very sensitive when it comes to this, so I shall say no more.The portrayal of the characters by the actors/actresses have been done very well, and I don't really have any negative comments for them, so I would like to congratulate them for a job well done.Now this is where I disagree with the mainstream comments: I found the pace of the film easy to follow, and not at all boring. I watched it twice and I didn't feel bored both times. Maybe it was even a bit too quick. I would have liked to watch a bit more and I thought it could go up to 3 hours, but that might be pushing the boundaries a little... Also, I felt that the artistic side of the film was done very well, from the costumes to the design of the Capitol.But I think the enjoyable aspects of the film speak for themselves. I should focus on the frowns a bit more:I do agree that the book is a lot better, though I enjoyed the film nonetheless. I would have liked to see the political context explored in the film, and yes, there was a lack of desperation during the Games, and even outside of the Games. I think the audience is all too familiar with images of poverty and disorder. The book has much more to offer than these superficial images of a dystopian world. And if there is one thing which can separate the Hunger Games from similar stories like Battle Royale, it is the political context of the Games. Hopefully, the next two films will pay more attention to these issues as the protagonists become involved in a bigger world.Also, the film did not develop the characters well enough. For example, there is more to the hunting and the mockingjay symbol than what the film suggests. Much of the history of the characters, as well as Panem, have been omitted. However, I probably enjoyed these aspects of the book most. It's not the actors'/actresses' problem - they have done a great job embodying the many aspects of the characters. Rather, the screenplay was unable to take advantage of the actors'/actresses' talents by not providing more background information to portray and develop the characters properly.As a film, I'd give it 7/10, but I've always had this personal attraction to dystopian stories so I feel inclined to give this film one extra score, which makes 8/10. And I will readily admit that I'm quite biased, too! :D",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
There is no need any word,"I have been waiting for three years to watching this film. I was very excited because I read the Hunger Games' books. Firstly, the book of Hunger Games to be printed 2008 but I read 2009 and I was very affected by the book. The story included both real parts and unreal parts. I think, this book's construct is very impressive. After I read the book, I watched the film and I found that, the film is very good. The characters of film's are related to book's of characters in view of my imagination. Actors' speaking, appearance, manners is very closed when it is comparing film and book. When I heard the bad critics about the film I shocked, because in my opinion the film has got very good construct and very good film player cadre. But I think that, who are doing bad critics, are not read the Hunger Games books. Because if one can not understand anything the film, I say only she/he didn't read the book or else certainly understand and admire the film. If I hadn't read this book, I wouldn't affected a lot. Because the book has got a lot of paper to giving a detail for reader, but the film is only showing two hours and only give specific points. Therefore, a lot of people didn't like this film but I very like this film but only I said negative comment about the film, the scene of dying Rue. If one didn't read the book never understand properly and didn't feeling like reader.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A disappointment,"It's a shame how one aspect can spoil the entire experience but that's what happened for me. Other reviewers have commented on the use of hand-held shaky-cam, fast-cut camera-work - none of them positively that I can find.From the Trivia section on IMDb we read this one sentence:---- The director has stated that his decision to go with shaky cam work, ""had a lot to do with the urgency of what's going on and to reflect protagonist Katniss Everdeen's point of view."" ----There was nothing ""urgent"" about the first 2/3rds of the film. I'm glad I don't go around throwing my head from side-to-side in normal life, stressed or not. When are film-makers going to realise they are the only ones that truly like this type of camera-work? They sit there editing the film on their desktop monitors in an office but faithful movie-goers have to watch their ""creativity"" on 50ft+ screens, where every sudden jerk sideways is at best distracting, at worst nauseating. It doesn't convey urgency, it conveys amateurism. Enough already.Hitchcock asked the composer Friedhofer, ""where would the orchestra be?"" when the latter wanted a string piece for a scene in ""Lifeboat"" The composer replied ""The same place as the cameraman."" We expect movies to have a soundtrack, and if the music is working properly, then we don't really notice it because it joins in with the visuals and enhances the scene. We are viewers of make-believe, sometimes realistic, often fantastical, and immersion into the world of the story is key to a satisfying movie-going experience. A camera being wiggled about on purpose draws attention to itself, and it shouldn't. This constant reminder of the presence of a, seemingly badly trained cameraman, is a real turn-off. Please stop it.As far as the other aspects of the film were concerned, I found the narrative somewhat plodding, and the pre-games section of the film could have done with being 20-30mins shorter. I knew nothing about the books beforehand, so I'm of the opinion that this is perhaps one for the S.Collins enthusiast rather than the general movie-goer. Though if the other reviews are anything to go by, plenty of Collins' readers are not very pleased either!",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worst adaptation ever.,"OK. So without sounding too much like THAT GUY, the hunger games movie was BAD. Actually it was worse than that. Its pretty much a perfect example of how Hollywood ruins decent books. Clearly tailored to the tweens who will, without a doubt, go see it with their moms, who are in fact still high off their Twilight buzz. Personally, I love to hear the DIE HARD tween moms claim there is NO similarity between HUNGER GAMES and Twilight. The director, in his allotted 90 Hollywood minutes (hopefully his last), drain this movie of ALL of the passion the books contain. He surgically removed all evidence of the socioeconomic struggle the characters go through,which IS the point of the movie. I mean ITS THE TITLE of the book! Either this Director (I only call him this for lack of a better word) did not read the books, or failed every English class he ever took. I suggest you read the books rather than go see this steaming pile of Hollywood garbage. All 3 books can be bought for less than the price of a ticket to see this crap.

What I expected and more ...,"From the moment I read the books, and then found out there was going to be a film I have been excited to see The Hunger Games. The wait was worth it, and I cannot express how much this film moved me.I was always expecting it to be good, because of the books. However, it was better than I expected! The characters were portrayed excellently especially Katniss. The settings were perfect and exactly how I had imagined when reading the books.There were a few let downs but very minor ones at that; a few changes to how things should have happened and a few things missed out that I thought should have been in there. However, it is only meant to be a film based on the book - they can't get it one hundred percent the same as the book and therefore I don't really complain about these minor faults.I would say to everyone - GO AND WATCH THE HUNGER GAMES. Whether you heard the whole 'Team Gale, Team Peeta' thing about this film - ignore that. This movie is about so much more than a romantic relationship between two characters. It is such a moving film and those people who bring it down to that 'team' argument are not giving it any justice and making it sound like a stupid meaningless film like 'Twilight'.So, don't be put off by thinking it's about the whole 'team Gale or Peeta' ... I promise you it is not and that you will most likely thoroughly enjoy this film (unless you wanted the team love thing).Overall, outstanding film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"The amazing story of how a kind, good heart and simple trust can save your life.","Wow.. This movie will have you leave the theater and never look at books-turned-movies the same way you did before.. It is insane how good they did this movie. The book does give a lot of insights into how the characters are feeling, and it's not vocalized in the movie, but you can see it on their faces, in their eyes.. Jennifer Lawrence does the incredible job of actually bringing Katniss Everdeen alive on stage, and I have never seen Josh Hutcherson act like this before. They truly are the embodiment of their characters, and I don't think anyone else would have done a better job living the story. Wow..

What am I missing here?,"I don't get what's the fuss about this film.To me it seemed like an excuse for a straightforward action-flick from the very beginning. The basic idea- people killing each other as part of a show- dates back to Antiquity. We've seen it countless times, in all settings and styles imaginable. As far as original ideas are concerned, this film- or the book, for that matter- doesn't even qualify for the competition.But that's OK. I like a straightforward action-flick. To be fair, it was a decently entertaining movie. But that's about the highest praise I can think of.The whole idea of a tense, psychological manhunt, with believable scenes and a careful pacing- that I was sort of hoping for- quickly ended up as a B-movie for kids. I just couldn't take any of it seriously. The whole 'world' in which this story takes place is all-too-obviously artificial, built hastily in order to give some supposedly-needed context for the whole 'Hunger Games'. It doesn't have any depth, any identity or personality. I don't know about the books, but I have a feeling I wouldn't like the written background story very much either. It's like... would anyone give a s**t about the whole imagined universe, unless the Hunger Games? It's just a decorum, but one I couldn't care less about.But that still would be OK. I just wanted a show. A cool manhunt, one where characters have to make tough decisions, where their true strengths and weaknesses come to light. Instead I was treated to the above mentioned kids movie. Genetically modified bees, gigantic dogs and godly f***ing firestorms coming out of nowhere, with no previous hint that they even exist. Rules randomly changed in the middle of the game. Characters eagerly conforming to their assigned unidimensional roles as 'arrogant bad guy' and 'nice kids who actually couldn't hurt a fly'. The nice kids are then conveniently killed off by bad guys or poison themselves only leaving the heroine the task to mourn them. Ridiculous, stupid tactics that no one would use, like placing all your belongings in the middle of a mine-field or sleeping like you're dead while the person you're trying to kill is camping on the tree... wtf was that?? All too often, the heroine was just saved by pure luck and lack of sense; I mean, seriously how far could she have wandered after being bitten by those bees? The others had all the time to arrange stuff around the mine-field, but not to walk like 100 meters further and kill one of their most dangerous opponents (supposedly).Anyway, I'm not trying to be overparticular, but the originality and the story being clearly not worth for consideration, about the only criterion by which this movie could be worth something is how cool, ingenious and smart they made the manhunt. It seems to me that everyone just took the safe way and piled up a bunch of clichés and/or ultimately dull scenes. I mean were you once surprised by the turn of events? Do you remember thinking wow, I wouldn't have thought he/she/they would do that? What a surprise?Ps. In spite of this all, Jennifer Lawrence rocks, I hope to see her in some cool movies over the next years. After she finishes this trilogy, I mean.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best I could've ever hoped for,"I read the Hunger Games about 2 years ago, and since then I have been obsessed with both them and the idea of the film. After reading other people's reviews and knowing the talented actors who were featuring in this film, I couldn't help but have very high expectations of it. It was even better than I expected. The acting of Jennifer Lawrence was amazing, she managed to keep all the parts of Katniss I loved, especially her fierce protectiveness over Prim and Rue. Josh's portrayal of Peeta was also good, although Peeta's charming character struggled to come through, though I think that was a problem with timing rather than Josh's acting. Other notable mentions are Lenny, Woody, Elizabeth and Liam, who were all great at their roles. Throughout the movie, I kept thinking of all the things that were missing, for example the Avox and Madge, but had to then keep reminding myself that it was a movie, and of course they couldn't fit every single part of the book into a 142 minute film, so if you think of it that way then you shouldn't be too disappointed. I hope in Catching Fire they find time to show Peeta's character a bit more, and explain about the Mockingjay's significance, but I think it did a great job at capturing the essence of the book. We weren't just shown scenes of Katniss and Peeta kissing, it had much more depth than I could have hoped. I felt the anger at the Capitol with Katniss, and the fear before the Games began, and have not been able to stop thinking about the Hunger Games since seeing it last night, and I think that is the important thing. Whether you've read the books or not, I'm sure you won't be disappointed with this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
'Most Dangerous Game' Update,"Watched ""Hunger Games"" with a friend the other day and it was another slog through the underbrush. That's the way most films made for the younger set turn out these days - uninteresting stories accenting form over substance and with inferior acting. But, since they're aimed at unsophisticated audiences, hardly anyone notices.This one is a variation on a theme that's been done many times in the past - humans hunted by other humans. This one has the requisite special effects and color process, sound modification, etc. but it is a joyless exercise with no heart at its core and no chemistry between the 'star-crossed lovers'.""Hunger Games"" is no better or worse than most other big budget pictures made nowadays that lead the viewer to expect more than what shows up on the screen. It benefits from a big publicity campaign, leading you to believe that P.T. Barnum was right.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Did the book Justice,"When I saw the first trailers for 'The Hunger Games' paid it no mind, especially after reading comments like the ones on this page stating it was 'Battle Royal with cheese' and 'like Twilight'. However, my wife after reading the books convinced me to do the same. As a 30 year old bloke I'm not ashamed to say the trilogy of books is outstanding, it is gripping, emotion filled, a riveting read from start to finish.I finally got around to watching the film yesterday and after reading some of the criticisms here I felt compelled to address them.1. Shaky cam: I've seen a few films where this technique is used to disastrous effect, the only point to it seems to be to make you feel sick. However, in The Hunger Games, the shaky cam is shot from eye level, often just behind the main characters head in a weird '3rd person' viewpoint that really, really works. I almost wept on a number of occasions as the emotions of the main characters hits you like a brick to the face. This is down to the amazing Directing skills of Gary Ross (I'll certainly be looking up more of his work).2. 'It's just a rip off of Battle Royal': Please. Three prerequisites are required for anyone to come to this conclusion: i - You've watched Battle Royal ii - As it's a cult film, you feel smug and special because you've watched it and the 'idiot main stream audience' haven't. iii - You haven't bothered to watched 'The hunger games'.Only on the internet, could this lazy opinion be allowed to propagate.Seriously, saying ""its like battle royal"" because ""kids are forced to fight to the death"" in both? Oh great, well in that case Harry Potter is exactly the same as Buffy the Vampire Slayer because both ""involve school kids fighting monsters with 'magic'"". See, I can be intentionally misleading too. Granted, there are parallels that can be drawn between the two movies, well, one parallel, that's all in fact.3. It's just another Twilight What? Because it supposedly involves a 'love triangle' between teenagers? Well, whoopdiedo, the internet guff is propagating again. Twilight is an awful movie, the direction is lazy, the plot is lazy, simple and dull, the only thing in the film is the love story. Though to be fair, there's not much you can do when you start with the premise 'Girl meets Vampire'. In contrast the love story in The Hunger Games barely registers, it's background, it's not what the film is about.The only thing these two movies have in common is the amazing scenery and...OK, Joseph does look a bit like Gale.4. It isn't true to the book. Yes it is, and where it deviates it does so for good reason, and it does so exceptionally well (either to simplify too-complex-for-screen issues, remove unnecessary characters, or to simply make the story better). This is the best book adaptation I have ever seen, and I include LotR in that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A decent film for a younger audience.,"For every successful film franchise based on books for young readers, like 'Harry Potter' and 'Twilight', there's one that sank without trace, E.G. 'His Dark Materials' and 'Stormbreaker'. The latest series hoping to make the transition from print to box office gold is 'The Hunger Games'. Grittier than 'Harry Potter' and less melodramatic than 'Twilight, this one could well make it. Jennifer Lawrence takes the lead as Katniss Everdeen, handling the role with amazing maturity. Woody Harrelson brings his immense talent to his character Haymitch Abernathy and is a welcome addition to the cast for older viewers. The plot has three distinct sections; before, during and after the games which is a lot to cover in a movie, giving a running time of 142 minutes. It's a credit to director Gary Ross that it doesn't outstay its welcome. Being aimed at the younger audience, violence is toned down as much as possible – although you're never in any doubt about what's happening as the game's participants fight to the death. I did find the costumes of the ruling classes over the top and a bit childish with their garish colours. Whilst not quite meaty enough to satisfy adults, this film does succeed in being well pitched for its target audience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I and my kids LOVED this movie!,"I took my 15 year old son and 11 year old daughter to see this movie. My daughter and I had read the book, my son had not. All three of us LOVED it, and plan to see it again. And again. And again. And buy the DVD. It followed the book very closely, was riveting and exciting. To address some of the common complaints:1. This is a 2 hour/22 minute movie. There is not enough time to put every single thing from the book into the movie. Character and storyline development was as good as it could possibly be without making the pre-Games half 3 hours long. The character development was good enough that several adults in the theater started crying at one point during the Games...2. ""The Hunger Games"" is considered a young adult/teen book, and the movie is rated PG-13, which stays in line with the book's intended audience. So don't expect it to be all blood and gore. There was enough blood to make it believable, but not so much as to offend or nauseate anyone. While the book focuses a lot on the violence, there are other important issues: reality TV, totalitarian government, class-separation...3. A lot of people don't like the ""shaky-cam"", and I can understand that. It doesn't bother me. It gives the feeling of disorientation and anxiety - what the Tributes were feeling - and also helps convey the bloody scenes - you only get snippets of the violent attacks and blood. Honestly, as I read the book, I was wondering how in the world they were going to show violent deaths of children to an audience of tweens, teens and parents. I think they did a good job.As I said, my kids and I loved the movie. It's a good idea to read all the reviews and consider the things you do or don't like in a movie. Does a ""shaky-cam"" bother you? Do you prefer to see lots of blood and gore? Do you need a lot of in-depth background and character development to feel an attachment to the characters? If yes, then you may not enjoy this movie. Regardless - if you are at all curious about the movie - GO SEE IT!!!

A step in the right direction for Hollywood fantasy movies for younger audiences,"After the overrated hypes around series such as ""Twilight"" and the last ""Harry Potter"" movies that are based on artificial special effects and rather mediocre acting I didn't expect too much from this new series that start with ""The Hunger Games"". To my surprise, this movie is easily better and plays in another league as ""Twilight"" or the last two ""Harry Potter"" movies.This movie is also based on many special effects but they are visually truly beautiful and the strange future world is quite interesting to discover. The acting is also solid at many points I really appreciated the appearances of the charismatic Donald Sutherland, singer Lenny Kravitz and the very talented young actress Isabelle Fuhrman. The movie also contains some decent criticism about media and society but it could dig deeper at some points. The open ending makes you want to see the evolution of the characters and the addicting future world in the upcoming two movies. This movie is a solid Hollywood popcorn movie for teenagers but might also please to older fans of fantasy and science fiction movies even though I prefer the more mature ""John Carter"" that has been released a few weeks before this output. I was positively surprised by the high amount of brutality and raw killing scenes in the movie that make it more dramatic towards the end. After horrible adoptions from fantasy books such as the teeth-less ""Eragon"" in the past, this is definitely a step in the right direction even of worried parents, conservative Hollywood maniacs and too religious watchers might feel shocked about these tendencies.On the other side, this movie offers nothing new after all. The dystopian context and the brutal games make me think of ""Rollerball"" and other classics and this movie has not enough originality and soul to come close to this masterpiece. It could though initiate a younger audience to this genre and make them discover further great dystopian movies such as ""1984"", ""Equilibrium"", ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""Renaissance"" and ""V For Vendetta"". In comparison to these movie this one we have here is rather forgettable and only worth to be watched once even though you get well entertained in over two hours of running time. I also disliked the choice of the main male character who lacks of charisma and guts in comparison to the convincing female lead role. Josh Hutcherson seems to be like a mixture of Justin Bieber and Robert Pattinson and seems only to be there to attract young girls to this movie. He might be a sweet guy for them but he honestly is a rather mediocre actor. The love story between him and the female lead role is simply not convincing in this movie and I'm looking forward to read the book to see if the whole thing is more authentic in the written version. The next time I wish the studios would chose an edgier and more unique actor or change the character of the book a little bit to make him more interesting. The soft guy simply feels out of place in this rather brutal survival movie towards the end.In the end, it's worth to watch this movie once and to get out and watch the two sequels if their quality is as good or better than this movie. It's nothing groundbreaking though or something I would watch twice or purchase. A younger audience might though like it and overall the flick is well done and a step forward after the last rather mediocre Hollywood fantasy blockbusters with the exception of ""John Carter"" and ""Super 8"" that were approximatively as good or slightly better than this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""May the odds be ever in your favor.""","""May the odds be ever in your favor.""Check out my full review at: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/04/hunger-games.htmlThe Hunger Games was a disturbing sci-fi dystopian tale of futuristic North America, that has been replaced by Panem, a country made up of 12 districts ruled by a dictatorship called the Capitol, who yearly pits one male and one female (ages 14-19 years old) from each district against each other in an arena in a battle to the death until one child remains.Visually, the movie is beautiful and has cool special effects as described in the young adult novel published with the same name. However, the disturbing plot is the less brilliant aspect of the film. The movie takes a long time to get into the meat of the story, namely, the Hunger Games. Much of the time, the film feels more like someone is reading you a (more boring) book instead of actually watching it.This is not a compliment. The movie feels like it follows very closely with the book (something I have read), but there are parts where instead of connecting emotionally with the characters and really feeling the fear, the exhilaration, or the remorse of the ""games"".Part of the problem with the film is that much of the book consists of Katniss, the lead character, and her thoughts and emotions running through her. The author, Suzanne Collins (a writer for Emmy-nominated children's hits Clarissa Explains it All and The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo among other things) uses the countless thoughts and emotions surging through Katniss' brain to tell the tale of her emotions and of how she copes with the horrors of living in the impoverished Seam of District 12, how she disobeys the Capitol by hunting in the off-limits forest nearby her home, and her feelings towards marriage, raising kids in a terrifying world like Panem, and her interests in two male friends.These thoughts were not provided in the film to its detriment. Collins captures in her novels so seamlessly who Katniss really is that as readers we can relate to her, feel for her and understand her fears in such a world, whereas the movie feels more emotionally distant. It's much harder in the film to really understand these ""kids"" fighting against one another and oftentimes as observers, the viewers are more just watching what goes on, on the screen and reacting.The movie lacks character development and love interests between the main characters. It struggles to really connect viewers to the grotesque acts on the scene and it really hurts the movie as a whole.Still, millions of viewers have flocked to the film the past couple of weeks, as it has earned over $250 million at the box office in its opening two weeks, however, the film was a bit disappointing in some of the areas that are most important areas.Jennifer Lawrence plays a terrific Katniss Everdeen and Woody Harrelson gives a memorable performance as the bumbling drunk, Haymitch Abernathy. The others give an average performance and are forgettable.For me, I left the theater feeling disappointed at Gary Ross' attempts to re-create the same feeling Collins created in her novels. Instead of feeling for these poor kids, I feel nauseous.My Score – Overall Rating: 6.75 out of 10 Plot: 7 out of 10 Character Development: 6 out of 10 Acting: 6 out of 10 Audio/Visuals: 8 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The New BATTLE ROYALE at Hogwarts,"Warning: I'm a German-Japanese / Poor English Abnormally, i'd generally like to experience remade flicks. More so the if i loved the original. I know there are extremely few which equals or excels to the original but it's not a big problem for me 'cause i don't even expect them to. It is to me like a bonus track of a beloved album, no more no less.So i got no hesitation in checking Hunger Games as well (i was even excited actually) 'cause the original must be in my all-time best 10, but, oh my..I won't say any more about this XEROX COPY crap. (copied on retarded machine, moreover) Nough said by nough people.Now one thing i just can't believe is how this could be legal. As far as i've read on internet articles, Sanjay and his people haven't even paid a penny to the original Oldboy makers for doing this, which means Hunger Games is not an official remake of Battle royale.Then what the h..! is Hunger Games's identity? Some's gonna say it's JUST BASED ON or INSPIRED thing but you know it's way beyond those kinds. Then what? Sort of Homage thing ? Yea possible, but Lionsgate and its company have hardly mentioned about the original on either official ads & reports or non-official comments. Instead, Liongate's kept saying he's got a bit INSPIRED ONLY and Battle Royale is totally different from THG or something like that.Besides, more importantly, while shamelessly copying scenes-by-scenes from battle Royale, Lionsgate intentionally missed the KEY-POINT of Battle Royale's story for his own audiences' taste, for COMMERCIAL PURPOSE in other words. Then how can we call it Homage anyway ? My conclusion is : HG is not only a copy crap, it's rather A CRIME, LITERALLY. I don't understand why Oldboy makers let them make money with this stolen thing.Am i disappointed ? No i'm fine i didn't even expect. I'm just p***ed and upset for this shitmakers' shamelessness that's all.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Enough,"First of all the book was outstanding. I loved in a maximum way I could love the adventure drama. It was so much fun to read this book that when I finished it, I was mad at myself for doing this so quickly. But I'm not writing this post about Susan Collins. It's about a movie:Generally, I liked the movie. Loved the way it was screened, liked the production design, cinematography, sound mixers and editors have done great job. So, this movie had every supporting feature that could make the story more spectacular.I liked actors as well. In all the whole cast is quite good and well fitted the roles they are assigned to. But Jennifer Lawrence is really awesome not because that I love her but her performance was exactly the same I imagined from book.The thing I did not like much is the screenplay itself. I know this is an adaptation but it was too much copy of the book, there was no surprises, no much creativity. I felt the director followed the book word by word, paragraph by paragraph and did not changed much. So I found the movie boring in the middle.

But a very, very proper teenagers film","Being realistic, they took a Rated R book, a story about an oppressive and extremely capitalist government, and they made it commercial, just like that, PG 13.Im 14 years old and I was dragged to the movie, I knew they had made it like this, commercial, I was expecting another twilight but instead of that I found out this is game changer for teenage films.The movie shows a lot of things about the human, we eat, or we wait for someone to eat us; and how can we people fight for our rights and against the oppression.In my opinion, it was quite good, if you are not expecting a perfect adaptation from the book, you won't get disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very good movie!!!!!!!!!!,"This is actually my 9th favorite movie right next to Inception, the Dark Knight, Terminator 2, and the Avengers! This movie is that good! Although the book had more details, and made more sense I still recommend this movie for Hunger Games fans. This movie is really appropriate compared to if every single detail of the book was put in the movie. If you don't know what the movie is about, then don't fret! This movie actually explains everything in the first 10 minutes.This movie has everything from romance, (which is for the show), action (basically 7/10 of the movie was all action) , and intensity. (which is the same as action) The actor for Katniss (the main character) was actually mystique from X men first class, I kept on thinking about the girl on fire looking blue! Although there is going to be sequels (Of course!) IMDb announced that there will be a 4th movie even though there are only 3 books.... Just asking.The Hunger Games is nothing compared to how some other movies look that are coming out this year, (Prometheus, the Dark Knight Rises, The Bourne Legacy, The Amazing Spider Man) but I still recommend The hunger games!

A reflection on us?,"I thought it was a reasonably good movie, compared to most I see. I thought the acting was reasonably good, the casting, direction, costuming/makeup well done. I agree with many here that the camera work was pretty annoying. I thought some of the special effects were pretty good.But what really hit me was the feeling of sitting there, watching the whole reality TV thing (or ancient Rome thing) taken to its logical conclusion, and that I'm actually part of the voyeuristic problem, because I paid my $10 to watch other people being killed. If you could do it (and I think you could), I think it would be very cool to have a scene where the camera pans around the audience in the film, watching raptly, but the camera continues to pan around the actual theater where we were all sitting and have us see ourselves for what we are - not much better than the people in the capitol feasting on the carnage. (Incidentally it doesn't help that many people here on IMDb have complained that the killing scenes aren't clear enough!) I find the whole thing pretty unsettling. I suppose that's the author's intention - I will now read the book to see if I can discern such a motive...and I will keep looking around the reviews and boards here to see if anyone else has this reaction - so far I don't see it. Maybe we're all too jaded to worry about that?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Fantastic. No it is not Battle Royale, no it is not Twilight.","Fantastic. No it is not Battle Royale, no it is not Twilight. Yes, I can see similarities to Battle Royal in how the competition is held, executed, and even the end result all together. However, Battle Royal is a Japanese film that has it's culture deeply embedded with in it, not to mention the heavy use of guns and other weapons not allowed or seen in The Hunger Games. Battle Royal is also incredibly gory and violent having no official rating in the US due to such factors. There is also the entire story surrounding the competitions which differ completely. There is no resemblance to Twilight other than that it will likely have a huge following, most of which will likely be the same age group and possibly even the same fans. Now that I have that out of the way, the film was very well done. The acting was very believable, which is important to note due to the huge science fiction or fantasy like culture that exists within the capitol when you have such derelict conditions within the districts. With this you have two very different cultures that make up the same nation-state. The filming in a few scenes could be described as shaky, which I know from past experience will bother those who are sensitive to such methods. However, I do not think most will notice it, and the majority of the movie was filmed quite well. The Hunger Games as a whole was all done very well, with the exception that the ending was rather anti-climatic. The ending truly just drifts off for the await of the next film in the series. I personally would have liked to have seen more violence and gore, but doing so would be unnecessary due to the context and target audience of the movie. Now that the movie is in full release I would highly recommend those reading this to go see it.

"don't understand all the negative reviews, it was great!","I had been waiting ages to watch this movie and was really excited cause it was getting great reviews from various critics. I then read user reviews and was shocked at all the negative responses so I did lower my expectations. however, i watched it and thought it was absolutely brilliant! a lot of fans of the book are giving it a lot of stick cause it misses out a few scenes and some changes have been made but my opinion is, if its good enough for the author, suzanne collins, who did in fact have a part in writing the screenplay and whatnot, then it should be good enough for the fans. I think people are just nit-picking; film adaptations are very rarely better than the books so just deal with it. as for the comparisons to twilight...errr no. the hunger games is better in every way, from the acting to the script. the acting by Jennifer, Josh woody etc. is on another level. its just fab. Jennifer and Josh portray their characters to a tee. everything is explained great so even if you haven't read the books, its easy to understand - no confusion whatsoever. a decent film adaptation doesn't leave people who haven't read the books, confused. only reason I've not given it a 10/10 is cause I would have liked a bit more blood and gore cause I'm weird and like things like that.

"A good movie, but I just wished they paid more attention to details...","I knew nothing about the Hunger Games book series up until this year. When I saw the previews to the movie, I assumed it was just another teen movie to drive me crazy will all the unnecessary hype. But I heard good things about the books from a couple of people and ended up reading it. Safe to say I enjoyed reading the first book and plan to read the rest in the series.On the contrary I was not too caught up with the movie. I tired very quickly of the teen frenzy, which included the Twilight mania. Although I actually enjoyed the Twilight book series as well, but the movies are probably one of the worst film adaptations of any book series. Again I digress. I had the same fear with the Hunger Games. On a good note, I was pleasantly surprised and happy that this is definitely not another Twilight.The Hunger Games was excellent in the visionary department. The scenery was excellent. The beautiful landscapes, District 12, the surrounding foliage and woods, and also the Capitol. I imagine you have to get the feel of the setting in the book. From the impoverished slums of the districts, to the plush and vibrant mood of the Capital. They did a splendid job on that.The Games were done well too. I liked the technique of them showing the blood splatter of the tributes that were killed. I think this could have easily been a Rated-R movie because of how brutal the killings were in the book, but I liked that they made it more easier for kids and teens to watch. The camera angles and tricks were also cool and added great imagery.I thought Jennifer Lawrence gave a convincing performance as Katniss Everdeen. One minor detail is that she didn't fit the physical description of Katniss (as also Gale) I just remember that some people made comments about some of the African Americans that were cast. (Rue, Thresh and Cinna.)I don't understand double standards. To defend the casting, I think Rue, Thresh, and Cinna where perfectly cast. I love Lenny Kravitz and who could resist the innocent face of Rue? The rest of the cast was surprisingly good as well. It was nice to see Donald Sutherland again.Again I know the books are always better than the movie versions, but I just wished they paid more closer attention to details. The flashbacks were kinda confusing and would probably be even more confusing to someone who didn't read the book. They cut several scenes and rearranged it. The pacing was sometimes slow and sometimes it felt rushed, but these are minor details that don't ruin the movie.I watched it four times already so far, so it is definitely worth more than one watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
May the odds be forever in Mockingjay's favour.,"'Last year was child's play' states Hamitch Abernathy, portrayed by Woody Harrelson. He is quite right too as Catching Fire, the second installment in The Hunger Games franchise has become; far darker, moodier and emotionally styled - all with a bigger, broader scope in comparison to the first.Continuing from the first HG, the film begins - as fans of the book will know - with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) back in District 12. With nearly a year passed since the events of the arena, and now mentors the duo must proceed with a victory tour throughout the Districts 11-1 to celebrate, all whilst keeping up the appearances of their love story. (There is not a single Prawn insight at District 9 - who knew.)Shortly after capturing all of the standout emotion and violent traits from the novel they arrive in District 1, the Capitol. Where President Snow orders in his army of Stormtrooper look-alikes to the lower districts and announces that the 75th Hunger Games also coincides with the third Quarter Quell. Where that years reaping tributes are chosen from each Districts existing victors. Which in turn brings Peeta and Katniss back into the arena one more time. Dramatic suspense entrails and the story continues from there.Taking over as director, Francis Lawrence- (no relation to Jen) and writers Michael Arndt and Simon Beaufoy have rather successfully crafted the story from paper to screen. Creating a rather faithful adaption. With its 146 minutes running time, it in fact includes almost every page from the book. But it is worth it.Filled with mesmerizing performances, surreal narrative and seamless CG effects, you easily forget that you are watching a 12A, what with the raining blood, killing of Pensioners and extreme whipping scenes too. You are only reminded that it is a Young Adult film when you see the Wizard of Oz style Capitol and Effie's (Elizabeth Banks) elaborate attire, and hairstyles that even Princess Leia would avoid.Post her Oscar win back in February, Jennifer Lawrence is the key to the franchises now even larger success. Her performance is flawless, emotional and simply striking. Portraying Katniss through and through, she represents the lost heroine lead that has not been this good since Lara Croft. Almost the greatest anyway, during filming Harrelson ordered on multiple occasions to give the Oscar back for forgetting her lines.Starring alongside the now Academy Award Winner, Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) now has an even bigger challenge. The first HG's showed him as a bit of a drip, rather weak and quite defenseless. But this time around he seems healthier, stronger and more confident in the role – but still not great. Also returning are regulars Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland, who has a much larger dictator-sith type role.Additionally the new cast is equally as exceptional, which include; Sam Claflin as Finnick (the most standout character, no doubt a fan favourite) Jeffery Wright, Jena Malone and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, respectively, are also brilliant. Proving promising sparring partners for Jennifer Lawrence.May the odds be forever in Mockingjay's favour.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Didn't Read The Book But The Movie Was Great.,"I heard people speaking frequently about ""The Hunger Games"" books but i thought it was yet another ""Twilight"" series. I disregarded the entire thing yet when i saw the movie trailer, it caught my interest. I regret I never tried this earlier(though not reading the book allows me to not compare both movie and book but rather critically view just the way the movie was made).The idea was quite unique and in my opinion, sometimes seeing something visually has greater effects. This movie has succeeded there, with scenes able to truly portray the feelings of that part. The sound is also quite satisfying.I liked the acting and the actors who portrayed the characters as they gave it a realistic touch,albeit some of the actors may not have really shown vivid feelings.Also,some parts of the movie left you hanging, wondering what certain things meant and some characters were shallow in that we never really learn anything about them, especially those who may have been crucial in our understanding of the story's background.Overall, it was an excellent film(for someone who never read the book and did not expect it).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Good Adaptation,"For those of you who don't know the basic story line: There are 12 districts controlled by the Capitol. Every year a boy and girl, aged 12-18, are chosen from each district to fight to the death for all to watch.There lies the biggest problem with this adaptation. It is about the brutal slaughter of nearly two dozen teens by each other, and yet the movie has been watered down to be PG-13 appropriate, most likely to expand the potential audience. Unfortunately, this means that the true brutality of the games is somewhat overlooked.For people who have read the novel(s), there of course are changes made. Having read the books when they first came out, I only noticed a few changes. Fortunately, these new ideas don't impact the overall story line that much, making for a good book to movie adaptation. However, the changes made do ignore some of the more subtle ideas of the book. This is especially true for explaining the relationship between Katniss and Gale, which is a minimal part in the movie because it occurs mostly in the opening of the book.Overall, the movie was well done. The camera work was often shaky (on purpose to create drama), which worked in some scenes but became tedious in others, especially when it was simply used to cover up deaths. The actors worked better than I had originally thought they would. Josh Hutcherson is a little too boyish in my opinion to play Peeta, especially since all of his work has been in children's movies, but he did pull off the role. Fortunately, there were no actors who simply could not act or just did not have the ability to fill the role.I went into this movie slightly terrified that they would ruin one of my favourite novels and was very pleasantly surprised when I left to find myself happy with the adaptation and with plans to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD. I definitely suggest seeing the movie, and reading the books of course.I rate this a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great movie, does the book justice","Yesterday, I saw the midnight premiere of The Hunger Games and I have to say this movie did not disappoint. The action sequences were good, and the story line was almost exactly the same as the book, probably because Suzanne Collins co-wrote the screenplay. The best performances in this movie came from Woody Harrelson as a drunk trainer, Stanley Tucci as a slightly gay commentator and Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen. The only problem I had was this movie was some of the characters weren't developed enough, or at least I felt that way. For example, Cato said three things then died. Also, the great Claudius Templesmith only said a few words and mostly just was a shadow under Ceaser Flickerman the whole movie. Hopefully this movie will succeed and become the next Harry Potter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A depressing Holocaust like movie,"Like too many futurist movies, this one too shows a bleak future. The most overdone and obvious genre. People who have lived 50 years ago and in their 80s now, tell you life is good and in fact better. So why the doom and gloom outlook for the future? It simply isn't true. The movie is depressing like the holocaust. Children worst of all being treated totally unfair and by their own society and what for? For no reason at all, just like sports pushing people for no good reason than to tear their lives apart for the cheer of a crowd of strangers. The entire premise of the story makes no sense.

"Distasteful premise made 'commercial' by its hedonistic, human-exploitation framework...","In the future, after war has ravaged the planet and turned the basic rules of society inside-out, a bloodthirsty public goes wild for a reality show in which different young people are selected as participants (mostly against their will) in a survivor-take-all outdoor showdown. Director Gary Ross, who also co-adapted the screenplay from Suzanne Collins' book (with Collins and Billy Ray), throws a lot at the screen (action, family drama, teen romance) yet is relatively unable to erase the distastefulness from this scenario (which isn't made palatable simply by putting the context of human exploitation within a totalitarian society framework). Jennifer Lawrence doesn't have a particularly expressive voice or face, though she makes us care for the central character, a tough young woman who volunteers to substitute for her little sister after the child is chosen as a participant during the preliminary 'reaping.' The handsome boys cast opposite Lawrence don't really suit her, however--and there's an unavoidably anti-climactic void at the finale, which leaves itself open for the obligatory sequel. Well-produced and occasionally gripping, despite over-the-top visual effects, jittery camera-work and simple scenes edited to a fare-thee-well, apparently by filmmakers who didn't trust the collective attention spans of the movie-going public. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Fine for young novel fanatics, but mediocre film","Just returned from the theaters. Let me make this clear firsthand, I did *not* read the books. I wanted to see what the hype was about and entered the movies ready to judge the Hunger Games as a film rather than a realization of the books. I have to say I was disappointed. The movie unsuccessfully tried to cram what appeared to be highlights of the novel's plot into 2.5 hours, shifting awkwardly from one conflict to the next. The pacing of the movie was terrible, with the opening sequences rushed, shaky, and almost unbearable to watch. Flurries of shots wizzed across the screen, each held for 1-2 seconds, attempting to illustrate the helter skelter of the main character, ""Katniss."" The result was a ratchety relationship barely developed between ""Katniss,"" and what should be the driving force behind her efforts, her family.Towards the second act of the film, I thought the movie would actually be OK; Katniss's character development improved and some intriguing conflicts arose posing potentially satisfying plot twists for her own journey. Yet none of these opportunities were maximized, and seemingly important developments were dropped for other conflicts that had no precursor whatsoever. There was honestly no tension anywhere else apart from the chase scenes of the movie, plus some awkward departure scenes in the beginning-- a style which I highly doubt dominated the novel. An earlier review noted how it seemed like the director just read the Sparknotes and crafted the movie-- a criticism which rings well with the movie's lack of meaningful development. The movie used the audience as a crutch, depicting events not as a means of solidifying the story,instead just paying small tributes (pun) to the novel.The books sounds like it would be a much better read. Once established, the premise seemed extremely promising with a lot of potential. Throughout the movie, I heard the teenage groupies giggling at the jokes that were most likely funnier in the book, but carried off poorly on screen. I'm guessing the books weaved the dramatic elements together much better. The movie crossed the bare minimum for developing plot, and only managed to carry across the basic storyline of the book. Yet I did not feel anywhere as involved in the story as throughout the Harry Potter series, which I thought was a much better execution than Hunger Games. So go ahead, pay that $12 for the movie ticket, but don't expect anything beyond a weak slideshow of chapter summaries.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Shaken and stirred,"I am a film nut which means I am crazy for directors. Rarely do films rise above direction. Gary Ross is not Nolan or Fincher and they are not Scorsese or Kubrick.In my life I can say that there are now three films that surpass the book that created them. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was better as a film. ""On the Beach"" was  better as a film. I had concluded that Gregory Peck may have been responsible for this. Now I have to add ""The Hunger Games"" to that list. Odd thing is that I did it backwards. I saw the film Friday and read the book on Saturday.It may be that the first person narrative was not as engaging to me as the film. I may be pathetic because I am old but I have followed Jennifer Lawrence since ""Winter's Bone."" I thought that she deserved the Academy Award then. I also know that the politics of that system allows great performers to be nominated over and over again and never win, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. Kate Winslet had to be nominated for two great performances in one year to finally win. I just assumed, heck, Lawrence is just a kid and she will get her justice later.I thought that she stole every scene in which she appeared in ""X-Men First Class."" That was a character driven cartoon with several terrific actors but even with McAvoy and Fassenbender, Lawrence shined.To add to my native, aged prejudice, I am repulsed by the teen-trilogies. If ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" and ""The Emprire Strikes Back"" offered the best,  then that is where I drew my lines. I am a ""Hurt Locker"" ""Tree of Life"" kind of movie film fan.Perhaps driven by lechery or recognition of talent, I rushed to ""The Hunger Games.""I have been blown away. I don't know how Lawrence manages to communicate to a camera as she does. These are not Streep's ""Sophie's Choice"" medium shots. These are intimate and intense close shots of the twitch of the eye, the corner of the mouth.The Dystopia runs deep but is passé to me. The world of Harlan Ellison was done best by Harlan Ellison. I have been closed to these revisions of his work.The film, ""The Hunger Games"" has opened my skull.I am not certain if President Snow is Kronos or Zeus but both kill their children. The Greek Mythology got one thing right, we kill our children. The manipulation of ""hope,"" which was crystal clear in the film, did not seem central to the book. It was not Katniss's endurance or heroism, it was her humanity in the darkness of savagery that broke me to tears. It is the flickering flame of humanity that has moved me to write this.I remain deeply moved. I can't get this out of my head. I am an old man who wishes our children are better than we are, not better off.

The author of the books should be ashamed of herself and BR should seriously sue the production company for lost potential profit.

A worthy adaptation,"I'll start off by saying; I have been a long time fan of The Hunger Games book series since my girlfriend recommended it to me. I read them all cover to cover within a week and a half, and I am not even an avid reader. In short, the books are highly addictive, and very thought provoking.When I heard that a film was in production for the first book, I was scared they would turn the whole thing into a ""Twilight Phenomenon"", a bad movie for 12-year-old girls to scream and rave about. And how wrong I was, this film is a very good adaptation of the book! I particularly enjoyed the added perspective of the game makers, which is something not detailed in the book. I thought the use of flashbacks to explain Katniss' family situation was appropriate and helped with the pacing of the film. Jenifer Lawrence was perfect for the role of Katniss; every wince of pain, every nervous line, every forced smile was very convincing.My only complaint with this film is Garry Ross's use of shaky cam throughout the action sequences; I understand he was trying to emulate the book's first person perspective, but I felt that it was over done, to the point of nauseating. Some sequences were hard to follow because you couldn't physically see what was happening. On the other hand, if the camera work had been steadier, the action would have been shown in much greater detail and brutality, bringing the film's classification closer to an ""R"" (or MA 15+ in Australia), which in my opinion would have been in keeping with the book's graphic and brutal style.But never the less, this is a worthy adaptation of an amazing novel; acting is brilliant, sets are convincing and characters were very true to their ""written word counterparts"". Despite some nauseating camera work, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone over the age of 13.

Really good movie,"Okay let make things clear. First of all, I really enjoyed this movie it was so well done! Everything that was important was here.

I don't think I would of understand it clearly if I didn't read the book seriously. And I also have to admit that the shaky camera was a little bit annoying in the beginning but then it was less shaky. Still, they did a wonderful job and stayed true to the books.Then, even if there were changes, I don't think there would be any better way to do it. If you really didn't like the changes, than tell me how would you do this? It's not that easy at all. Plus, since the book is written in Katniss' point of view it is harder to ""convert"" it into a movie. So, they made it perfectly and there were scenes that I imagined the way they did it.Finally, The Hunger Games movie is an amazing movie, it has a little bit of all.

An OKAY Entertainer...,"THE HUNGER GAMES is a teen-action film directed by Gary Ross, starring Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Donald Sutherland, and many other supporting cast.So The Hunger Games, is based on a book about this country called Panem which consists of 12 Districts and its Capital. So a bunch of years ago, there was a District 13 but there was a war, which demolished 13. So to remind the whole of Panem that the Capital was still the big shot, every year they held a televised program called The Hunger Games, where one young girl and boy was chosen from each district as Tributes, where they would fight in an enclosed arena to the death where one would survive and crowned victor, and bring the tribute's district money and respect. So this time, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence)'s sister gets chosen, and out of love for her sister, she volunteer's as tribute, and along with her Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) gets chosen... and the rest of the film tells us what happens to the both of them.Okay, I read the books of Hunger Games, which is a series, and when I heard the movie was coming out, I was so hyped for it. I even forced my friends to come with me telling them the exact same story above, because it sounded so great, and come on, if you are a guy and just read that story, you gotta be pretty intrigued. So first day, I went for the Hunger Games, expecting mind-crushing action. I was all like ""YEEUUHH, kids fighting to death! What are the odds of it being bad?!?!"" Turns out, quite high. Okay, so this movie isn't THAATT bad, but it just totally changed my WHOLE opinion of Hunger Games, just because of a stupid rating. ""A RATING?! What does that have to do with anything"" you say. YES, a rating. From the story of Hunger Games, it is completely an R rated film! but they had to go ahead and mess that up and make it PG13, just because the books had its fame with teenagers. The book focuses more on action, which I loved about it. The film, on the other hand, does all it can to focus on the one thing which the book needed, because there was no way they could edit it out, which was the romance. I'm not blaming Suzanne Collins, it was 100% needed, yet she did her best to lower it down so that it wasn't that big a deal. The movie, because it was PG13 and couldn't put the action, decided to make the romance a big deal, and went ahead and messed up people's thoughts on Hunger Games. The only one time they had action was at the part when The Hunger Games actually starts, its brutal but they use shaky cam so you can barely see anything. Half-way through the film, I was wondering, ""Is this what I want from this film? Coz it sure as hell doesn't feel that way.""In the end, this movie is an OKAY entertainer... because now they are making another one, as planned, but its going to be PG13, which makes me doubt myself on whether I should see it or not. See what this movie has done to me? However it isn't a twilight fest, don't worry, thats something Hunger Games will never do to you.

Powerful!,"After reading these amazing books, my expectations were very high. I thought the movie stayed very true to the books and the essence of this story. The movie was, for me, a facilitator of the images I constructed in my head as I was reading the books. I HIGHLY recommend reading the books before watching the movies because most of the books are about Katniss' way of seeing things, how she felt, etc and of course, that's hard to catch in a movie so the books are helpful in many scenes where the things Katniss says are important to understand the full meaning of the scene. If I had to choose between the movie and the books, of course I'd choose the books but gladly, I don't have to choose and I can enjoy both masterpieces.

Worthwhile dystopian adventure,"Released to theaters in March, 2012, ""The Hunger Games"" is a post-apocalyptic film based on Suzanne Collins' popular book. A new nation, Panem, exists in North America where Capitol is the seat of Panem's wealthy, eccentric populace and cruel totalitarian government, which hosts the 'hunger games' annually, a brutal reality show featuring 24 contestants from Panem's 12 subjugated districts. The contestants, called ""tributes,"" range from ages 12-18 and there can only be one winner since it's a survival fight to the death!The first thing that impressed me was the realistic air and overall ambiance of the film, as well as the entire dystopian concept and story set-up.Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, as the two ""tributes"" from District 12, Katniss and Peeta, are quality protagonists and I like the ambiguity of their feelings – are they for real or for show.Lenny Kravitz stands out as one of the few caring characters from the Capitol, while Woody Harrelson is effective as the drunken adviser to the tributes, a past victor of the hunger games. Also on hand are Elizabeth banks, as the creepy but sorta winsome host of the District 12 tributes; Donald Sutherland as Panem's dictatorial president; and Wes Bentley as his right-hand man with a beard Satan himself would covet.For me, the weak point of the film is the long third act, which constitutes the hunger games themselves, a fight-to-the-death in the forested wilderness (shot in the mountains of Western North Carolina). I anticipated this to be the best part, especially since I love survival stories and the wilderness, but it just wasn't as suspenseful or thrilling as it could have been. At the same time, it wasn't bad. The additions of the dubious ""mockingjay"" sequence and artificial horror-dogs who for some strange reason can't overtake the protagonists mar the film.I thought the name of the nation -- Panem -- was really strange, until I discovered that 'Panem' means ""bread"" in Latin, as in the popular phrase ""bread and circuses"" (panem et circenses), which is figurative of superficial appeasement to pacify the masses. In the film, President Snow said something to this effect to Seneca Crane (Bentley). On top of this, the film shows flashbacks of Peeta intentionally burning literal bread and throwing it to the starving Katniss, which saves her. The bread motif appears elsewhere as well: as a parachute offering to Katniss from District 11 to show her their gratitude for her kindness to Rue (Amandla Stenberg) and the bread parachutes given to the tributes that communicated covert information.I was a bit bewildered by the ending, since it left some things up in the air, but I suppose it leaves room for sequels.When the credits began to role a song came on that just blew my mind; my wife motioned to leave, but I couldn't leave my chair while this awe-inspiring tune played. It's ""Abraham's Daughter"" by Arcade Fire, an incredible piece. Check it out on youtube.FINAL WORD: If the long third act were better I wouldn't hesitate to give ""The Hunger Games"" an A-level rating. As it is, it's a good dystopian adventure with some excellent aspects, like the entire set-up, the protagonists and closing song.The film runs 2 hours and 22 minutes.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hunger Games is perhaps the first great movie of 2012!,"I have to confess that I've never heard of the book ""The Hunger Games"" or that novel's author, Suzanne Collins, and if it hadn't been for the hype surrounding this movie and the way it seemed to capture the public's attention, I probably wouldn't have even bothered. Now that I have, I have to say that I was spellbound by the whole thing! And megakudos to director Gary Ross for filming at such a compelling pace and giving lead Jennifer Lawrence great presence throughout. And having such supporting players like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and especially Woody Harrelson add to something on screen when given their scenes. The inference about how violence involving 12 to 18-year-olds is used as merely entertainment for the rich masses in some unforeseen future really took me to someplace fascinating if maybe also a little frightening. In summary, I loved The Hunger Games and I can't wait for the sequels when they come!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not another adolescent ""hype""","My expectations were very high, I have read all three books, and I am an absolute fan of THG. The film was really good, they did change a lot, but I think they did it for the people that haven't read the books. They tried to make it less complicated than it seems, because in the books you can hear the thoughts of Katniss all the time, but they can't show thoughts in the movie.. I think the cast set up an amazing performance. I absolutely love Jennifer, she's very confident and strong but she can also show her sensitivity to the viewers. Josh is just adorable, in every way. I'm not a huge Liam Hemsworth fan, but he was rather good as Gale. I do have a downside. I went home with a major headache, cause I was on the 4th row in front, and the camera was really shaky so your eyes get so tired of it. The director attempted to make it that way, and to make it less 'flowing' and the attempt worked, but not when your sitting out front..Overall, good film, great cast, and I'm waiting for 'Catching Fire'!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Ignore the Twilight comparisons, this is great!","Despite what you might have read or heard from all the lazy promoters out there, this is no Twilight. Yes, this is a film adaptation of the first of a book series (three to be exact) that are adored by teens and young adults the world over. Yes, the tale is told from the POV of a 16 y.o. girl. Yes, there are two boys who are smitten with said girl. But no, this is not a weepy love story with shonky action and dubious acting. The Hunger Games – set in a dystopian future where two adolescents from each of the 12 districts of Panem (nee U.S.A.) are chosen to engage in a televised battle to the death where only one survives – is a thought-provoking and ambitious dramatic blockbuster that tackles themes such as oppression and class divide, all the while offering up thrilling (and surprisingly violent) set pieces and intriguing character arcs. The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, is played to perfection by Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique from X-Men: First Class), who injects the ideal amount of both strength and vulnerability into Katniss and subsequently earns the audience's whole-hearted investment into her plight. Elsewhere Josh Hutcherson is solid (if not as powerful as Lawrence) as fellow competitor, and potential love interest, Peeta Malark, whilst older cast members Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci (very funny) and Donald Sutherland provide terrific support in their smaller roles. The Hunger Games is not perfect – the CGI could've been better – however it's an engrossing event that deserves to attract widespread critical acclaim along with its guaranteed massive box-office haul. Do yourself a favour and ignore the Twilight comparisons, this is well worth a visit to the cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hero Emerges in The Hunger Games,"Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss in Zen-like focus draws her bow and aims her arrow to punctuate her point. Nothing personal. Making her point, she says. ""Thank you for your consideration."" Lawrence is amazing. Her Katniss is the brave and noble hero, who never forfeits being a woman, in fact it is the source of her courage and compassion in Suzanne Collins's ""The Hunger Games"" envisioned on the movie screen. After selflessly volunteering as Tribute to replace her younger sister Prim (fearful Willow Shields) for The Hunger Games, she consoles friend Gale (charismatic Liam Hemsworth). Gale, her blossoming love interest and hunting mate, reassures, ""You're stronger than they are!"" Katniss admits that she only hunts animals. Gale reminds that people are no different.At the dramatic arc in the woods, Katniss kills a boy out of rage and vengeance—still in icy repose. What good can come of kids killing each other, in a bloody contest of survival? That is the paradox of Director and Writer Gary Ross's ""The Hunger Games"", based on the book by Suzanne Collins. Ross, Collins, and Billy Ray wrote the screenplay based on the first book of Collins's enormously popular bestselling trilogy. I have not read the books. One of my friends Carol, also a published author, had told me that the books were great. I took her word. ""The Hunger Games"" is awesome: You have a young girl, who is the powerful hero of the tale. Jennifer Lawrence makes ""The Hunger Games"" work. Katniss is not the physically strongest, fastest or most skilled warrior. However, she is the toughest and she's smart. In a great scene before the Games, she tells her costumer Cinna (fostering Lenny Kravitz), ""I'm not afraid."" And both Gale and Peeta, who fall in love with Katniss, are attracted to her courage and character. Collins gets her hero transformation right.""The Hunger Games"" depicts the post apocalyptic world, where the United States is now Panem which consists of 12 Districts. President Snow (calmly menacing Donald Sutherland) seemingly uses starvation and shiny objects to oppress the population. These are the 74th Hunger Games. Every year each District sends a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to the Capital to compete in The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are like the reality TV ""Survivor"" on steroids combined with cage fighting, where children compete to the death—only one winner.Though set in the distant future the story opens in Katniss Everdeen's home District 12 which looks like a 1930's coal mining town. The dichotomy is that each cabin has a flat screen to watch The Hunger Games. Ross and cinematographer Tom Stern (""Million Dollar Baby"") have a serene affinity for the land—filmed mostly in North Carolina. The music by T-Bone Burnett and James Newton Howard provides a haunting down home atmosphere. Katniss lives with her Mom and sister Primrose (innocent and fragile Shields). Her Dad died in mining accident. Katniss helps feed her family as an expert archer and hunter.When Tribute Escort Effie Trinket (seemingly vapid and unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks) selects Primrose in The Hunger Games lottery, Katniss (Lawrence) volunteers to take her place, and save her life. The other participant selected is Peeta (subdued and strong Josh Hutcherson). They travel to the Capitol to train and compete in The Hunger Games. They meet their mentor and former winner Haymitch Abernathy (deceptively powerful Woody Harrelson), who occurs as a drunk washout. Harrelson is one of the wonderful touches: As Haymitch he distinguishes the greatness in both Katniss and Peeta. He schools them in playing the Game. Peeta reveals that he has always been in love with Katniss. And she practically strangles him after his disclosure.""The Hunger Games"" has a broader metaphor. When President Snow talks with Host Seneca Crane (meticulously charming Wes Bentley), he says that the only thing more dangerous than fear is hope. The Hunger Games exist to kill all hope. Amidst the atrocity of children killing each other for celebrity and food, the hero emerges in Katniss, who inspires others. Lawrence never sacrifices Katniss's humanity and boldly acts in the presence of fear. She gets amazing support from a talented cast. Stanley Tucci balances flamboyance and awareness as talk show host Caesar Flickerman. Amandla Stenberg is touching and powerful as young Rue, who befriends Katniss. Hutcherson is vulnerable and brave as Peeta. In the story Peeta can throw a 100 lb. weight 50 feet, but this is never used as a logical threat. Granted the twist is that Katniss is the savior.The fighting scenes, including the climatic fight, are difficult to discern in the quick cut edits—maybe not Ross's strength. ""The Hunger Games"" is not an action movie, but action threaded. This is a minor point in the big picture. ""The Hunger Games"" is the great classic hero story that inspires others to dare to be great. Jennifer Lawrence is the awesome hero Katniss. Bring on the revolution and the sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Her acting skills are very good and she is a really potential star on the rise. Stanly Tucci does a great job as the eccentric Caesar Flickerman who is TV presenter and Tucci has a small role in this movie but he really plays his character very well.

The Other Actors have done their part very well and the acting in this movie is very good.The Director Gary Ross has done a brilliant job in making this movie and he implemented this interesting story and concept brilliantly and made a very good fantasy movie and he has done a marvelous job with his acting crew which is mostly a bit in-experienced.

Hunger Games: Winning at the Box Office,"The Hunger Games was a terrific movie, and probably the best ""action"" type movie since District 9. This is more of a character driven personal story than an action thriller, though it certainly has enough action and thrills.The acting carries this film. Hutcherson does an admirable job of conveying the shift in the character from a gross lack of confidence, to competitor, to lover? Well, maybe lover, as the director does a terrific job of blending the competitors fake affection for actual affection brought on by the intensity of the setting. Hemsworth's small role seemed to be a teaser as Thor's little brother is expected to play a much larger role in the sequel. Finally, Jennifer Lawrence is terrific in her role without using a ton of dialogue. She delivers powerful emotion without speaking, which is a bit reminiscent of Clint Eastwood.This more than compensates for a handful of flat, underdeveloped and ""evil"" characters. There were numerous other actors and actresses that delivered in the final product including Woody Harelson, Elizabeth Banks, the always terrific Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Southerland, and an amazing though short lived performance by Amandla Stenberg.Gary Ross perfectly blended all the elements of action, suspense, and even some lovey dovey moments. The beginning of the movie had several nice touches including the split screen and polyvision which amplified the crushing presence of government and the poverty of the people. The costumes, specifically those of the ""peace keepers"", were terrific and gave a feel of 70s and 80s science fiction.The bottom line is that Lion's Gate hit it out of the park, and unless Batman can rise to the challenge this could be 2012s top grossing film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Entertainment with Fine Performances,"The Hunger Games (2012)*** (out of 4)Good adaptation of Suzanne Collins' novel is part THE RUNNING MAN, part THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME and part BATTLE ROYALE. Set in the future, each year twelve colonies must send a boy and girl to participate in the sport known as The Hunger Games. The battle to the death will allow for one winner who will get to take food back to her people but this year there's a twist as the two contestants from twelve (Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson) begin to have feelings for each other. I'm probably one of the very few that hasn't read the novel so I have no way to compare the two and I can't say what the book got right or wrong. For the most part I thought this was pretty entertaining from start to finish even though there are some flaws in the film. I think one of the biggest flaws isn't really the fault of the film but when you know sequels are coming it's pretty hard not to know what's going to happen at the end of this film. The one other problem might get me killed by some but I found there to be very little passion between the two leads and I thought the love story was the weakest thing even though this obviously plays a very big part in the film. With that said, the rest of the film was highly entertaining and I was pleasantly surprised to see how effective the film was even with its PG-13 rating. The hunt sequences are actually pretty intense and there are some gripping moments during the deadly games. I also thought the entire opening bit was quite good and really helped build up the hype for the game that was to follow. It also didn't hurt that the cast were so good. Lawrence turns in another winning performance and she's so good here that it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off of her. I also thought the supporting players were great including Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Wes Brently, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks. THE HUNGER GAMES also benefits from some beautiful scenery even if some of the CGI looks incredibly fake. Again, I'm not sure how this differs from the novel but as someone unfamiliar with the story I must admit that the movie is extremely well made, gripping and delivers some fine performance all of which makes it worth viewing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just a good plot start point,"Just a good plot start point to give a pseudo-socio-political vision of an unknown country, but that it does not give any details and focuses on the action and adventure of survival. Technically it starts with too much camera movement, something that can take you out of the story. Fortunately it stops and go on with more common ways of filming. There is a continuous walk on the edge between popcorn movie or something more serious and deep. At the end you are not sure of it is totally achieved or even you never get to know about the real purpose. The best without doubt, the image of the media and realities. And overall the uncomfortable and uneasy feeling that it generates and that leaves us wanting compensation.

Absolutely amazing! Not disappointed.,"Firstly I have read the trilogy and it is by far the best series I have ever read! I've waited for about two years for this movie and I expected to be disappointed. Like most movies being adapted from a book, they mostly disappoint but much to my surprise The Hunger Games definitely did not disappoint me! It followed the storyline extremely well and I was impressed with the film. The little changes that were made from the book all worked out well and nothing in this movie was done bad.The acting was well done especially from Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and although Prim (Willow Shields)was not in the movie as much, her performance nearly brought a tear to my eye. The emotions that came out of her brought my emotions out which is quite hard for actors/actresses to do.Overall, I am extremely happy with this movie and I could not stop smiling.

A big block buster of a chase movie,"6/10. Like an episode of Bear Grills meets the running man, I have mixed feelings about this one. Whilst it undoubtedly has its moments I cannot overlook some of the more annoying aspects of the film. Specifically the jerky camera thing, I assume this is some kind of ""technique"", if that technique is to make its viewers feel sick then bravo! It worked. Woody Harrelson has a great knock about role, but I wasn't sure what his motivation was, he seemed to swing from useless drunk to ruthless realist, I didn't get it. The ridiculous female character who picked the names, what was that all about? What was her role? Too many questions, not enough time, even in 2+ hours.

Competent adaptation but TONS of hand-held camera = bad experience,"I think that given the time restraints of feature films this adaptation fairly communicated one of the most interesting YA books I've read in years.

As a person who truly believes that is an actor's job and also a person who suffers terribly from motion sickness I thought this was a terrible injustice to the story and actors assembled to bring this feature to life.

The Hum-Drum Games,"OK, firstly, I only jumped on board with the hype at the last minute, I read the first book about a week before the opening, and have yet to read the sequels and personally I do not care if adaptations stray from the source material. That's fine. It's good, it means that the script- writers, directors, actors etc. are not completely brain dead, so any review comparing the two materials is just redundant as literature and film are two different mediums that cannot be compared.The film:Acting: 7/10 I don't get the hype over Jennifer Lawrence. She was good, but not amazing. They could have done worse; she held her own over the show and I must admit she didn't screw up so credit is due there, most of the other actors were sub par, but again, didn't screw up too badly. Little Rue held her own and her death scene was quite powerful, but was ruined by the lack of violence (I'll explain my problem with the whole lack of violence on it's own later), Josh Hutcherson was alright. Not as strong as Jennifer, but not as weak as Liam Hemsworth. The adult actors were not dreadful; but not amazing enough for merit.Story: 9/10 The film's story was interesting, especially how they managed to explain every aspect fully and successfully so the film was clear and well done. It's not an original story by far, but the plot is great and it's expressed in a very universal way.Direction: 3/10 Awfully directed in my opinion. I hate hand held camera's and the shaky- cam in this film was over used to death. My biggest hang up of this film over all is the lack of violence. Yes, I understand that to appeal to the wider audience they had to cut back on the gore, violence etc. But in my opinion they went too far. Rue's death wasn't half as impacting as it should have been, neither Cloves', Cato's, Marvel's or even Peeta's injury. They held back and the film greatly suffered and lost the majority of it's impact, stunting the story and the cohesion of the film as a whole. The directing wasn't a one because when the directer finally put away the shaky-cam for a moment the shots were nice and decent, but most of the action, albeit had to be re framed made little or no sense- case in point- Clove tackling Katniss, the actress Jenifer Lawrence had a good six inches from the angle of the camera over Clove, and with the obnoxious unrelenting of the camera movement I can give no reasonable explanation to how that little girl over powered Katniss. And when Thresh killed Clove I had roll my eyes at the blatant awfulness of the death itself. I'm not a gore hound, I admit, I might be biased: I like violence, but this film's sequences are barely coherent and sadly really ruined the viewing experience.Overall I give this a six. Not an awful film by any standards. And maybe a re-viewing of the film again with more attentiveness on my part it could be better, or it could just be the sheer audacity of the producers to cut away much of the impact of violence ( a huge theme, I might add) for more profit revenue. Thank you Hollywood. But hey, the sets were pretty and the effects were good, well, all except Katniss' barely flaming costume.Over and out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Practically How I Envisioned the Book (Except Probably Cinna and the Cornucopia),"Just came home from watching ""The Hunger Games."" I have read all three books by Suzanne Collins several months before, so I know what will happen already. Despite this knowledge, I remained excited and riveted by how the details of the story had been translated on screen by writer- director Gary Ross.The first hour was dedicated to the events preceding the games, as the last hour and a half depicted the games themselves. This movie was the story of a future world, in a country with 12 districts controlled a central Capitol. Every year, they would commemorate the revolution by staging a ""Hunger Games"", where two tributes from each district would fight to the death until only one remains the victor. On this the 74th Games, the tributes of outlying District 12 would be Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutchinson) and the central heroine of the series, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence).I could say really that this movie was practically how I imagined the book while I was reading it. I guess you can also say that Suzanne Collins' description of this non-existent world was so vividly cinematic to begin with. First rate special effects were used to bring essential highlights of the book, such as the ""girl on fire"" costume and the control room of game-master, Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley). However, credit should also be given the intimate scenes that did not rely on any special effect, but the sensitivity of the actors themselves. These were also well-executed, albeit sometimes bordering on cheesy (although that was how they really were described in the book!).Overall, I would say this movie achieved that rare balance between book and film interpretation. Fans of the book and those who never read the books both would appreciate the characters, story-telling, the set design, art direction and visual effects. This is a must-see, and sets up the upcoming sequels as there is no doubt they will also produce the next two books, ""Catching Fire"" and ""Mockingjay"". Well-recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Splendid.,"I stumbled into my local Odeon outlet completely blind as to what to expect of 'The Hunger Games', as, having never read the books, I would have been. Only obtaining some minor information beforehand apart from The Guardian's review, I was prepared for anything.What I got was a well executed blockbuster.In a bit more depth, The Hunger Games was well acted and put together, unlike so many other films on the market today. The plot-line was heavily similar to Koushun Takami's 'Battle Royale', one of my all time favorite novels, however, until the day comes that it gets a GOOD film adaption, The Hunger Games makes a good substitute.In order to keep the age limitations down to a minimum, it was obvious heavy camera shake was employed, although, in some circumstances it made me doubt the sobriety of the cameraman. Also, this focused the story more on survival and love elements, which were pulled off reasonably well. However, despite its 2:20 running time, I felt some characters were really just placed to die, and I found I didn't care for them due to lack of character development. I reckon The Hunger Games would probably benefit more from a mini-series, but as I said, all round, It was all very slick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lazy and lacking emotionally,"Adapting a first-person story as a third-person film takes out a majority of the story. Katniss's thoughts are what drive her characterization and it's through her that we grow distaste for the Capitol/Panem. If you take out her thoughts, you may as well not bother making the film. Yes, having voice-overs in a movie becomes draining after a while, but not when those voice-overs actually link you emotionally to what's being depicted. Katniss's dialogue, (important when it comes to talking with Peeta) does not deliver enough during most other parts of the story. The Katniss on screen is just a shallow representation of the book's Katniss. Without her viewpoint, Prim, Rue, Cinna, Haymitch, and even Peeta are pointless. You just see people moving on screen.I don't feel pity for the districts nor for the tributes. Death in the movie, in the end, is just death. But in the books, each death furthered hatred towards the Capitol and President Snow; you want to destroy them and you want Katniss to win. It was that desire that makes the series so endearing and addictive.The visuals were okay, though. As was the acting. And the countdown was exciting. The costumes, however, were too bizarre without the explanation for them. And the climax was abysmal.It was just lazy, and laziness is easy to spot in art.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Top Movie with a brilliant forward-anxiously Story,"This Movie goes to No. 2 of my favorites movies. After few shows in cinema i tell my opinion there:The beautiful Jennifer Lawrence and the other young stars doing an amazing performance. Im very impressed of the talent young actress and actors, that they playing the role VERY professional and emotional. This means also for the other older stars.The story is brilliant, a thinking will-be-future mordern future binding with old political elements. The movie combines dramatic and action with emotional and few romantic moments with a challenging story and very emotional music. It brings the people deep in the movie on the cinema screen. Not oversizes special effects show this very realistic and breathless.I give this title a 9 of 10. Only one star minus, because of to much camera shaking's in the scenes, that are to much i think. Also a few decisisions are foreseeable.Overall, the most people have the same opinion. A great start for this new trilogy. The movie is not for a special audience, its for all people. So a must see. I will go few more in the cinema to show that great title.The gross in the opening weekends going into records...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I Aim to Misbehave,"All of my friends know that I'm a dedicated fan and proselytizer of the Firefly television series produced by Joss Whedon in 2002 and canned summarily by Fox Television before it was given a chance to gain an audience. True to the spirit and very premise of the show, after cancellation it emerged through word of mouth and a widespread underground movement to become one of the most popular DVD collections ever. Universal Studios then acquired the rights to produce the movie Serenity in 2005, concluding the arc of the story and initiating Mr. Whedon to big screen directing. Nowadays the one season series runs almost continually in syndication on cable.This story is reminiscent of the first Star Trek series, which was also cancelled (if somewhat less rudely) by clueless executives in the sixties, going on to become one of the most successful movie franchises ever. Ironically, Firefly offers sort of an anti-Star Trek narrative, where the corporate establishment that the Federation glorifies has now become bad guys and the heroes are essentially anarchists and criminals. Likely this is symptomatic of a collective loss of faith in the promise of unending technological progress and the corporate American Dream. Personally I hope that it indicates a resistance to the virtual assimilation and homogenization of the social commons by the Borglike marketing spheres of vast networked entities like Facebookistan and Twitter.The quote, ""I aim to misbehave"", is one of the key lines spoken by pirate captain Malcolm Reynolds before he leads the forces of the the Alliance into a deadly trap to expose the secret that allows them to maintain absolute control. It expresses the spirit of contrariness and rebellion better than almost any phrase I can recall spoken in the movies. I've decided therefore to establish a personal commemorative to honor any movie or television show that embodies the subversive spirit so well portrayed in Firefly.To this end, the first award goes to The Hunger Games, a film by director Gary Ross (Pleasantvulle, Seabiscuit). In a recent interview on Elvis Mitchell's show, The Treatment, Mr. Ross speaks about his interest in exploring societies where a select few exercise disproportionate power without consensus (the 99 and the 1 percent) and how single acts of morality can cause the tenuous fibers of that culture to unravel.I saw the movie the other day, not without some apprehension. Judging by the number of cover stories on the magazine racks of my local grocery store, it was the most hyped movie since Avatar, and it appeared to be geared toward a younger audience that flocks to movies like Harry Potter and the Twilight series of vampire melodramas. Not only was I more than pleased with the movie itself, I was gratified that such intelligent storytelling is going over big with an up and coming generation.The Hunger Games worked for me on many levels. The story is a finally crafted arc where a young and very believable heroine named Katniss Everdeen (embodied with strength and intelligence by Jennifer Lawrence) grows beyond her narrow focus on survival to discover the boundaries of her own ethics and morality. She lifts it proudly in the face of a brutal spectacle in which she is risks everything. Supporting the lead performance by a fine group of young actors are veterans like Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson (particularly good as a game survivor and mentor) and Donald Sutherland.Although the movie is set in a high tech future the special effects are largely understated and never come to dominate the performances. Most of the narrative takes place in the woods of an Appalachian wilderness (it was filmed in and around Ashville, North Carolina) reminiscent of the Michael Mann film of The Last of the Mohicans. Unlike many sci-fi epics, The Hunger Games keeps its focus tightly with the point of view of particular characters. Through mostly close-up footage we witness the world narrowly through the eyes of Katniss and thus are taken along on her very personal journey. Outside and against the point of view of Katniss' we see the spectacle from the standpoint of those who work the machinery. In a single notable exception that breaks us out of this closed circle we get a short glimpse of people rising up in response to an act of courage and honor to express rage and quickly repressed rebellion. The scene is effective and memorable as it exposes the thinly fraying threads of brutal control that an act of individual courage can potentially unravel.The spectacle itself is portrayed as a cross between a television show like Survivor and a modern broadcast version of the gladiatorial arena. By juxtaposing the brutality spawned by the Roman Empire with the presentation techniques of contemporary television (only the costumes and hairdos would seem out of place) we see the dark side of how modern media becomes the primary vehicle for social control. This is the reality of network television.At the end of the movie we are left with an acute awareness that beneath a very thin veneer of temporary media satiation large forces have been triggered by an act of moral courage. The story is only beginning. Although I've never read the books, I can't wait for the sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hunger Games (2012) - Make Way for the Game of the Century! The World Will Be Watching!,"Adapted from the highly-successful book franchise by Suzanne Collins, the highly anticipated ""The Hunger Games"" makes a fresh start to a successful movie franchise. So, here's the good news to all fans of the books, the movie is a success from start to finish. Set in a strange world in the future where the Capitol selects a boy and girl from twelve districts, and they are forced to fight to the death on television, Katniss Everdeen has volunteered to take her sister's place in the latest match, and might take the biggest challenge of her entire life. Jennifer Laurence delivers one of the best performances of her career as Katniss, bringing the perfect mixture of sharpness, cleverness, and powerful enthusiasm to the big screen. Josh Hutcherson is also really good for his performance as Peeta, a contestant who remembers Katniss, and Liam Hemsworth as Katniss' oldest friend. We also get some stellar performances by a remarkable casting ensemble. Elizabeth Banks as the director of the District 12 group, Stanley Tucci as the games' ringmaster, Donald Sutherland as the evil president, and Woody Harrelson in a nomination-worthy performance as a previous Hunger Games champion with a taste for the drink, are all just brilliant in their own special way. Yes, this movie is 142 minutes really long, but you will be entertained a lot by this movie, you won't care if this movie takes forever. Director Gary Ross makes the perfect accomplishments to keep this movie relative to the books. Stellar art direction, enchanting costumes and makeup, and breathtaking visual effects and sound, help you get captured in the wonders of this movie. But most of the credit has to go to Jennifer Laurence, in her winning and powerful performance in this movie. Whether you're a ""die-hard"" Hunger Games fan, or if you never read any of the books, ""The Hunger Games"" is still an entertaining ride from start to finish that has everything to offer from a talented director, wonderful visuals, and a breakthrough performance by Laurence. This is the best movie of 2012, so far! ""The Hunger Games"", in my review, ""a groundbreaking feast, what a journey!"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
watch Battle Royale instead,"This is could easily be a copy of Battle Royale for children. I do not understand why the author of the books would copy so blatantly an outstanding book/film and turn it into this. The Japanese film(which is also based on a book) is absolutely shocking an breathtaking. If you have not seen it yet, please do.Nonetheless, hunger games is a watchable teen movie. I don't understand why they had to repeat some scenes over and over at the beginning. Its a long film with not much action. The ending seems rushed and very much predictable.It could be worse. But has been better, in Japanese.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much better than I thought it would be!,"First of all, I wanted to hate this movie so much because of all the hype. All I've heard about for weeks is how awesome this was movie was going to be so I didn't even think it would live up to all the hype. I was completely wrong. (I also didn't read any of the books so I didn't really know much about anything except the main plot.) As much as I wanted to, I honestly couldn't find anything I didn't like about this movie. The acting was very good. The fighting scenes were all very cool and sometimes very intense. I thought the visual effects in the movie were really cool. There were several points in this movie were everyone in the theater goes ""Awww!"" There were also some very funny parts in this movie which I wasn't expecting! I can't say this is my new favorite movie and I don't think it's the best movie of this year so far but it's definitely up there. I can say I enjoyed this movie very much and I think that there's something in this movie that everyone can like.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Decent movie,"I'm a typical 21 year old student. I thought I'd see some lame movie for teens, but I was pleasantly surprised. I saw the movie WITHOUT having read the books first (I think you need to judge a movie on its own, not versus a book. Just like any another movie).The concept isn't that original throughout time, but it is original in this setting. Put some people in a cage, and the last man standing wins. First time I've seen that idea with children though. The acting was great. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job, and so do other actors.Even Lenny Kravitz delivers a good performance. The main plot seems (as unlikely as it sounds) believable. I had heard about horrible and gruesome details, but that's just wrong. The makers don't hide that children die, but they don't show it in a gruesome way either.The camera-work and overall directing of the movie are really good as well. But, there are some issues. The entire movie just seems to short.A longer movie (or possibly 2 parts) would've been justified. The love subplot is unbelievable. At least in the movie. And, the movie seems to go a bit downhill near the end. So, conclusion: good movie, but not great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Really great movie.,"This movie was fantastic. I'm the type of person that picks out the flaws of movies, and to be honest I only saw a handful, which was rare. I'm sure if I watch it more, I will see more. But the story was awesome even though it borrowed from other tittles. It actually made me go and buy the books which I will start reading shortly. One part I really liked is when the commentators actually talked about things that were happening. And Katniss was played fantastically. One thing I wish they did, was add more of the survival aspect of the game. It seemed like it went too fast. But that is why I will read the book and get the full sense of it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
In General,"It's pretty good. Most of the unfavourable reviews come from a tendency, which might be called - No, there isn't a chance, that a film based on a teen-bestseller book-might be - artistically good. But well, it is. A genuinely perfect scene-to-scene montage reflects the struggles of unimaginable dictatorship. As for actorship I'd like to mention Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland as making the perfect ""baddie"" image. Especially Snow's mono-dialogue about hope - which is near to Gregory Peck's acting. The trembling camera comes and goes as a feature, but it establishes a certain here-be feeling, which might've been lost in some of the terrible CGI scenes. All in all - even a literature critic, who happened not to have read ""The Hunger Games"" ""read"" all she needed from Gary Ross's sweat and blood, which took to make this extraordinary good ecranisation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Possibly Great if...,"Ill start off like most people Yes I read the books before seeing the movie, that being said I think the movie is a solid. I'll break down my review because there are some elements that need to be addressed and this is the easiest way I can think of doing it. I'll do my best to not give any spoilers.Story:I don't read a lot of books but I was compelled by my wife to read the books before we go and see the movie. I thought the books were great and the story in the movie follows pretty darn close to the first book, with some elements from the second book thrown in. This leads me to believe that the second movie will not only contain elements from the third book but some from the first book as well to tie it all together. Yes the movie does move along at a fast clip which I could see it making the movie confusing for some people, but it kinda had to move fast in order to be a two and a half hour movie. It was not as dark as the books and some of the traumatizing elements that you are supposed to be left with happened so fast they didn't quite sink in.Characters: So the main characters such as Peeta, Katniss and Gale and even Effie were done great and were introduced very well. However like I said in the ""Story"" portion the movie does move along fast so a lot of the other Important characters such as Hammich, Cinna and his team were introduced but not developed very much (This may be corrected in the second movie). But the time everyone spent on screen was done very well.Directing: OK so my main gripe, the shaky cam thing was overdone. There were times when a shaky cam would be fine but shook so much you could hardly make anything out (may have been necessary for the PG-13 rating for the gory stuff). And other moments when a shaky cam is not necessary at all it was used (the reaping seen WTF?). The time when you were supposed to have your heart strings tugged on where there and did what they were supposed to but the action scenes tend to happen so fast you would almost miss it (once again PG-13). Would this director have been my first choice being his biggest movies were Seabiskit and BIG, no. He has not done a future/Sifi/action/suspense flick before. But he did the drama portions very well, but needs to work on fast moving action scenes a little more.Overall score: The movie is a solid 8 on its own with a possibility of being raised to a 9 or 10 if the subsequent movies are done right. Was everything perfect no, but the movie did succeed in me wanting more which if the next movies deliver it will be Awesome!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"No More Camera Shake, please!","All in all, The Hunger Games was a good movie. They did a good job of sticking to the book, though there were some minor details they left out, but it didn't change the story too much so I think it worked for the most part. And since the main character was also the narrator of the books and you never saw anything other than her point of view, I thought it was interesting how they showed the outside world when she was in the arena. However, since the books are in the first person narrative, the emotion of the story was not conveyed as well I it could have been, but how would someone convey that without a fully narrated movie, which would become irritating? The only thing I really disliked was the close-up, camera shake style that was used. You could barely make out what was going on in the fight scenes, or even some of the non-fight scenes because they did it this way. I understand that they wanted you to understand the fight or flight stuff. And it had to be kept PG-13 so the inability to really see the deaths and bloodiness was part of the reason for the style, but really too much shaking can sometimes induce nausea! Other than that, I think they did an awesome job with it! They kept to the book much better than some movies I have seen adapted from books. My only hope is that they do not continue the nauseating camera shake style for the rest of the series. There are better ways to show the action and emotion of a scene. Still, highly recommend The Hunger Games! Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""The Hunger Games"" - Well made, but it didn't bite hard enough","The film adaptation of this first book in the popular Y.A. trilogy is visually stunning and packs an emotional wallop! Set in a bleak future reminiscent of something from a George Orwell nightmare, we find our heroine, Katniss Everdeen, thrust into a bloody tournament called The Hunger Games, where she is expected to fight to the death against 23 other youths, all of them under 18. The whole world tunes in to watch. In the universe of The Hunger Games, this is tantamount to the Olympics, and it happens every year. To most, this is entertainment.The film is shot beautifully, the frame gritty and full of popping colors. We get down and dirty with the fighters, tributes as they are called, right down in the arena with them. It's a scary place. It's made all the more real by the outstanding performances by all, wholesome and sinister. Jennifer Lawrence is unstoppable it seems, and is destined for greatness. She is joined by other talented actors like Woody Harrelson, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, and Josh Hutcherson - all of whom pour their hearts into their characters, making their presence known no matter the amount of screen time. You feel these characters are real, and that they must exist, and so the gravity of their world is felt all the more. Fans of the books won't be let down, for the script is very true, and succeeds at capturing the essence of Suzanne Collins' vision for the world of Panem.The theme of the books, and the film as well, is one of purposeful irony. Here we are, eyes glued to the silver screen, watching children murder each other. Are we to be excited when we witness them hacking each other to pieces? Even if it's a ""good guy"" kid impaling a ""bad guy"" kid? No, not at all. The film is a challenge to us all to reexamine what we find as entertainment, and ask ""why?"". What is it about reality television that keeps so many Americans tuning in week after week? Are we aware of an ever-pushing envelope? Do we make conscious efforts about what we watch, or do we simply watch what flashes on the screen in front of us. How strong is the media's alluring spin on our discernment about what is moral? I know I'm guilty.Many find the film's storyline deplorable. Why? Is it not the attitude towards the material that we should be evaluating, not the subject that the writer has freely chosen to examine? To be angry at the film's theme and content, and even its approach to the material, is outrageous. You're not supposed to find it entertaining, it is supposed to make you sick and disturbed.The film is simply a commentary of our society's disgusting love and heartfelt embrace of outrageously immoral behavior, expedited through and by the Media.The Hunger Games could have been sharper, however. It could have examined these themes even more, it could have further and more explicitly explored the totalitarian society the film inhabits. The film plays a little light on the heavy subjects, and seems to cater more towards an audience that may not fully understand the deeper message. A PG-13 audience may be simply entertained, and that would be a tragedy.Perhaps the film wasn't shocking enough, not enough to rattle the masses from their comfortable cages anyways, but merely enough to give them something to grumble about on the way back from the cineplex.The Hunger Games is a film to ponder deeply, however surfacey it may seem. There are still two more films to come, and I hope they are even more powerful than this great first installment. May the odds be ever in their favor.By TOMMY BOND, thefilmdiscussion.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
When will Hollywood remember the value of Steady Cams,"The movie was well made and pretty much followed the plot. Where it was necessary to carry a plot element but eliminate the character on whom the plot point centered in the book, they found a clever way to reroute that element to another character. There were a few things I was hoping to see that weren't there, but the movie is already 2.5 hours. All that said, however..... Dear Hollywood, shaky, hand-held cameras are dramatic and artistic and provide a gritty realism. ON THE OTHER HAND, shaky, hand-held cameras are annoying, distracting, occasionally nauseating, and do NOT provide the atmosphere you envisioned in your head. So stop it already. Steady Cams were invented for a reason.I will not see this movie again because of the bad camera work.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The best of all the four movies ever made from the novels!,"The Hunger Games (2012) the first movie of the series in my opinion is the best of all the four films ever made from the novels! I thought was pretty damn good awesome start of the series from it's books I love it and it is my favorite. Katniss killed three people in the first movie and she was very gorgeous talented and very intelligent. Is my favorite best film of the franchise, I own this movie on DVD and Blu-ray disc. Just my Blu-ray has a better quality. I love this movie and it is the best in the series I don't think the sequels are better than this movie, I am sorry I just don't agree with other opinions saying the sequels are better they are not. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) is pretty good damn sequel and that a good one, but not better than this one and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a true disappointment, I haven't seen Part 2 yet but I hope it is better than part 1.The first movie in the franchise is evolving in a Dystopian future every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the Capitol of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen volunteers in her younger sister's place and must rely upon her sharp instincts when she's pitted against highly trained Tributes who have prepared their entire lives. If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. I love the challenge and the game so much. For 2. Hrs I was entertained on my seat from the beginning till end.""The Hunger Games"" is a rare book-turned-movie that's able to live up to the gigantic hype of the book series it's based upon, while also standing out as a superbly crafted action blockbuster all its own. It's a marvelously entertaining thrill ride from start to finish that never forgoes its characters' humanity, nor does it ever abandon the strong political and social undertones of its source material. In the end, not only did this film exceed all my expectations of what a cinematic adaptation could accomplish, but it truly encapsulated everything I felt while reading the novel for the first time. I had no expectations for this film.. I thought it would be another ""Twilight"", however I was so wrong. I actually enjoyed it. The plot was incredible, the acting was sublime. Incredible film that blew me away. I am honestly honored to have had the pleasure of watching it. Definitely going down on my personal movie list :P A triumph! The odds were actually in my favor this time :) I would definitely recommend this - it was amazing, and I was obsessed with the movie and cast for a while afterward. But you should read the book before you watch the movie, but that's just my opinion ;)Jennifer Lawrence is amazing, gorgeous as Katniss Everdeen, very, very beautiful talented and sexy. She did amazing perfect job playing her character, this is the second time I memorized her in famous role. The second famous role she played was Raven Darkholme/Mystique in X-Men: First Class and X-Men: Days of Future Past. I heard that The Hunger Games quadrilogy and X-Men trilogy are the last movies of the franchise she will ever play. Than she will start playing in stand up alone roles. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy did an outstanding performance of acting his character. I had no idea Woody Harrelson will be in this movie and he did a job so well.This is a great futuristic Dystopian science fiction film. The people in the Capitol enjoy the Hunger Games, for them its their yearly highlight:) But for the poor people from the District it's a punishment. I did enjoyed some action sequences and clever intense scenes, like Katniss been on a tree and than climbs up the tree towards the nest and begins sawing at the branch holding it up, until the nest of venom wasps fall down and kills Glimmer (Leven Rambin) who stung too many times by wasps. It is hard to believe people would want to watch kids battle to the death, but in the Dystopian future is everything possible.

Great to be brought to the screen,"Gary Ross directed The Hunger Games, based on the screenplay by himself and Suzanne Collins (she is also the novelist) and Billy Ray, with much aplomb.Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth were all very good.Summary: There is an annual event whereby the capital of the nation of Panem makes sections to send a boy and a girl to compete in what is known as the Hunger Games.Televised all over the nation, the event has Tributes fighting each other until the last tribute is left standing. Our hero (heroine), Katniss, uses her instincts and skills that she learned from a former victor. It's basically the survival of the fittest.I've read the books. In the book, Katnis has clear thoughts about everything, which is kind of missing in the movie. I really wish that aspect was played up more in the movie. But given that the filmmakers ended up with a fast moving and action packed theatrical piece of entertainment, I can excuse the omission.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is a very good movie.,"Shocking as this may seem, this is actually a very good movie. What seems to be a contrived, half-backed plot set in some futuristic, post-apocalyptic world, is actually a substantive story. The lead actress gives a wonderful performance as a courageous teenager who is determined to survive without becoming depraved. This movie in some ways parallels the Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger, except here the characters are more nuanced and the heroine much more vulnerable, making her surviving that much more impressive and dramatically compelling. The supporting cast is excellent too and includes a composite of characters that are both amusing and repellent. The audience is kept engaged as the plot movies full speed ahead, taking the audience for a ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Y'all gonna hate me: it's better than the book!,"Like so many, I read THG when the hype started to swell and while I liked the book, it had some problems that prevented me from loving it. Enter the movie. Since most movie adaptations from books are worse, I initially didn't have very high hopes for it. The fact Jennifer Lawrence was cast didn't ease my mind either, as I have seen what big movie franchises can do to decent actresses; compare Kristen Stewart's performance in The Cake Eaters to her performance in Twilight for an instance. I rest my case.Then reports started coming in about excessive shaky cam usage. About Jennifer being ""too fat"" for the role. Key passages left out, etc. I decided to ignore all that and give it a shot.Well, I was pleasantly surprised!THE GREAT: - Jennifer Lawrence really does deserve all the praise she gets for her acting talent, because she really delivers in this. When she shoots, you believe she is a great archer, when she whimpers, you feel her pain and when she cries she seems genuinely upset. She conveys layers of emotion with a single look. I love how she doesn't have the blank stare many young starlets have. This movie rests on her shoulders and though everyone else did a good job, it all would have fallen apart if it weren't for her.And to all who call her ""too fat"" you know that if she had lost a ton of weight there would be trashing going on about her promoting an unhealthy image. Damned if she does, damned if she doesn't. For the record I think she looks lovely, a breath of fresh air in an industry populated by people as fake as those in the Capitol.Jennifer made Katniss seem like a real person of flesh and blood. In the book, though I like the narrative, Katniss comes across as inconsistent. Very capable one moment, an emotional wreck the second. In the movie they have really found a balance. She shows emotion and it seems fitting because she's only 16 and not raised to be a killer. She has the intelligence to be clinical about many things, but she shows emotion in matters of the heart. She's capable and likable. I didn't always feel that way with the book, but I did with the movie.The editing. It was very natural. The shaky cam didn't bother me at all, in fact it added to the realism. Cuts were clean, not dolled up with cool effects. Some people complained the early kills were hard to see, but I liked how it was done. You could see the desperation and the swiftness and viciousness. Alive one moment, dead the other. No glamour. Just like in real life. I love how the movie does not indulge in gore, unlike many others. Deaths aren't glossed over, they are presented just as they are. Which makes the whole story even more tragic.THE GOOD: - Set, costumes, special effects. It looks like a different world, but recognisable at the same time. Believable. Never once did I feel like I was watching actors in costumes. Everyone seemed right where they belonged. The effects aren't the best you've ever seen, but they get the job done. - Supporting cast. All very capable actors who know how to deliver their lines. I didn't really buy into Rue's performance at her last scene, but that's a minor thing.THE BAD: - Personally, nothing about this movie is bad. Personally, they fixed a lot of issues I had with the book. I preferred Katniss & Peeta's relationship in the movie over what's described in the book. If I had to name one thing it's that I would have liked to see more of their training.CONCLUSION: -A very faithful adaption that stays true to the book without having to sell its soul. In fact, it improved upon it. Great main character, suspense, action. Definitely a favourite of mine.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better Than What I Thought.,"I just came from seeing this film. Well, what can I say? It was a good movie, although I did see two other older movies in it. I was told to read the book before I saw the movie and if I did that would make the movie even more better. Well, I didn't read the book at all but I still thought it was a good movie. What separated this movie from the other two movies similar to it was the make up of the storyline. Here you had a couple of other situations that took place in the film apart from the main storyline. The acting was pretty good too. Isabelle Fuhrman(Clove) did a pretty good job doing her part. It was almost like she was playing her role in Orphan again. The book has two sequels. So if they are planning on making them to this film I think I'll take a peek at them as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Intense, poignant, heartbreaking movie.","Having read all the original books, the only thing I can say is ""Wow"". The movie is so much like the book it's scary; even minor details, like the character's appearance, are faithfully included. Jennifer Lawrence was an incredible pick as Katniss, pouring her all into a heartfelt performance that made me cry at times. And Josh Hutcherson was a find - he portrays Peeta accurately as a caring, compassionate individual who fiercely loves Katniss. A warning: while Katniss and Peeta's romance is included, it's definitely not the forefront of the story. But what takes the movie to the next level is the supporting cast. Stanley Tucci is exactly how I thought of Ceaser Flickerman; he pulls off the entertainment personality flawlessly. Elizabeth Banks is almost the comic relief of the movie as Effie Trinket, and Woody Harrelson almost unnoticeably sets the tone for the movie as Haymitch. The actors really make the movie what it is, pouring their all into their performances and giving depth to such a politically poignant movie. While it is pretty violent, the end result has me counting the days until ""Catching Fire"" hits theatres!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Superfans Be Easy.,"Superfans be easy. If your barometer for measuring the success of Hollywood's Hunger Games adaptation begins and ends with faithfulness to the source material, by all accounts it is one. If you can swing a bit of emotional transference, all the better — I suspect few who enter without a preexisting love for Katniss and Peeta will be moved by their exploits. This $78 million companion piece to Suzanne Collins' young adult novel isn't especially concerned with converting the uninitiated; it's about cashing in on a fertile franchise. Cha-ching!For the rest of you: Katniss Everdeen is a girl from District 12. In the future, America is divided into 12 districts under a totalitarian government. Once a year, at a grim lottery known as a ""reaping,"" two adolescents' names are drawn to represent each district in a televised battle to the death known as The Hunger Games. Katniss, 16, has survived several reapings, but when her younger sister's name is called, she volunteers to fight in her stead.Directed by 55-year-old Gary Ross, The Hunger Games isn't exactly brimming with angst and youthful energy. His craftsmanship is competent, but Ross puts too much pressure on the talent to sell Collins' world and contributes too little himself. Where's the scale? The novel pops with aesthetic opportunity, but Ross isn't visionary enough to really capture our imagination. District 12 is a destitute mining community that counts starvation and black lung among the leading causes of death. Show us that. By skimping on act one atmosphere, the director undermines the comparative splendor of the bizarre and extravagant capitol city.Ross routinely sabotages the emotional potential of Collins' story and setting. The reaping in particular lacks narrative punch. Ross adequately animates the flesh of the scene, but as a storyteller he fails to find the soul. On paper, a family is splintered and an act of defiant bravery instigates a Herculean trial. Ross puts the impetus on the audience to feel the weight of that choice — artistically, he renders the scene with all the gravitas of mild indigestion.And the cast — talented though its constituents may be — often feels curiously misplaced. Kudos to Ross for casting an anti A-lister like Jennifer Lawrence as his lead, but he negates any goodwill with clunky misallocations of more famous folk. Woody Harrelson sticks out like a sore thumb as drunkard slash mentor (in that order) Haymitch Abernathy. Harrelson's half- hearted take on the character plays like a spacey stoner from a bad SNL sketch. Stanley Tucci and Lenny Kravitz are also underwhelming as Hunger Games host Caesar Flickerman and stylist Cinna, respectively.It feels like an eternity before the games actually get underway, and it quickly becomes apparent (this is a criticism consistent with the novel) that any illusion of challenging the preconceptions of preteen storytelling disintegrates. Granted, there's a bloody death or two, but mostly Katniss gets by with clever alternatives to direct combat — there's something distinctly Home Alone-ian about watching her drop a hornets' nest onto her would-be assassins. For Ross' part, he frames the action just inelegantly enough to obscure any offensive violence.Ultimately, what works about Hollywood's Hunger Games adaptation are the traits intrinsic to the novel. A worthy premise lends a compelling backdrop to a young adult coming-of-age sci-fi romance whatchamacallit — and Ross borrows those ideas wholesale. It's all there. His is a relatively faithful transcription of the source material, and it's a shame he does so little to distinguish his version. He fails to replicate the emotional oomph of Collins' imperfect novel, and expands upon those imperfections with lazy visuals and uneven pacing. After all, when financial success is a certainty, there's little incentive for a director to think outside the box.Naturally, my complaints will carry little weight with the Hunger Games superfans, for whom this film was expensively and exclusively realized. If you count yourself among that elite group — read no further. This is your film. Enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good movie, certain aspect of the movie I didn't like","This is a good 'last one to survive' movie, similar to the game mode battle royale. The plot was good and was intriguing through out the whole movie. I like how it doesn't go straight to the action, rather it builds up to it which I liked. The action scenes were good, although I wish there was more, especially with the contestants fighting each other. One thing I didn't like about the movie is how the people in charge of the game were involved in the game itself and trying to manipulate how the game goes. Like starting a fire and unleashing beasts; what's that all about? I just wanted the contestants to fight without any help and influence from the people in charge. Other than that, the movie is pretty good and you should definitely watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The broken, slightly troubling premise aside this is still a worthy watch","(61%) Just like ""Battle royale"" (which got there first), this fails to make its perplexing plot make a whole heap of sense, as the question ""Why are they getting little girls fight to the death again?"" never really became apparent. That aside I do get the appeal of its source, so when it's aided by rising star Jennifer Lawrence's fine acting ability, with good solid support, a fair amount of action, and decent character development resulting in a very watchable sit. The direction though is far too wobbly and slack at times, and it's a fraction too long, but the mild violence did upset the daily mail which is never a bad thing. For a movie based on a book aimed at teens this is somewhat better than I had assumed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
9 out of 10 ! PERFECTION,"I give this movie a 9. No movie can be a 10...but this was close, did not read the books, was disappointed no nudity or sexual content but oh well it was a children's book I think? But I love movies on the future, and I look the character diversity. The writers and director for this movie did a marvelous job on this movie, could not stop watching, I defiantly wanted more, and I do not mean after the twilight movie to see if Edward marries Bella or not. This movie was in no way corny, it was ruthless and evil and I loved it. It really showed what American could be like one day, Americans living in poverty in different districts and none ever knowing what it is to see luxury and the ones unfortunately chose to fight in the hunger games, their last few weeks to live are treated to the luxuries and are styled for the Hunger game crowds. Amazing! Amazing! Movie!! Now know this, I had only went to see the movie because my boyfriend had begged me, I never knew what the movie and or book was even about, so I went into this movie not knowing the plot or characters, so I got drown in.

"Poignant, and often gruesome modern day Roman gladiators ,asking should we","In todays world , where classes divide people, we have middle income America, and on each end , the poor and the elite on the far end of the spectrum.Often the two rarely meet or have much in common, but no one cares when you enter a fight for your life, and in this movie those that are vying for the right to life, are but mere children. If that notion scares you as a mother or a teen, this movie may not be for you . I personally think that while the movie doesn't leap to the level of 'saw' or similar types, its enough to have possibly warranted a R rating. I would certainly think twice about taking a teenager, because some scenes are extremely vivid.That sad, while I went into the movie expecting horrific things, I admit to being overall impressed with the take away.The harsh reality sets in as a opulent and lavishly dressed 'announcer' shouts names from a list of teens to be involved in a gruesome last-teen-standing duel. We are then presented with a short 'video' explaining why all this has come to pass , and that those involved in this 'battle' most violent, are there due to a treasonous event of their ancestors. A high price to pay for civil disobedience, though we aren't told the details of any of it.You do not need details, when its rather clear why everyone is there and the cruelty about to unfold, and I suspect those details will be present in some 'sequel'.As I sat watching, I was pleasantly surprised to see not just another gruesome violent fest, but real philosophies being presented; as in out of the mouthes of babes . These aren't all just willing participants, but in a few cases, reluctant, sometimes to the point of rebellion at great risk of bodily peril.'Players' are thrust into a environment ( after coaching), not unlike the gladiators of ancient Rome. It's quite unsettling given the age group of the people involved, but it sets a proper tone for what is to come. The innocent of youth, thrust into the barbarity of war, and those 'in charge' with their opulence and extremes, poised over their materialism to the exclusion of the safety of those about to fight.The movie includes not only great acting from a young new cast, but exciting visuals, exciting if not basic plot line and amazing visuals of a world seeming full of technology, yet some questionable morals.To consider ones death yet remain true to their nature, as well as wishing a end to the sickness , where rooting for a victor , yet sadness when a entrant succombs, are expressed sentiments.This is no pure gore fest, but do take care in taking those young adults who may need to wait a few years before seeing something so visually troublesome. Everyone else will see a movie that on the outset may seem gruesome and violent, yet inside containing questions of us all, in a sometimes world where injustice and elitism rule the day.A decent see not for its violence, but the questions asked by the participants.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Well, it does actually deserve an 8","Sure, it does. The concept of the movie isn't anything new, more of the same storyline or a mixture of themes of the movie Death Race, Spy kids, a little of the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire- yeah, teens forced to battle at life-threatening conditions to survive for a cause. If you haven't read the book like me, you'll find that the same popular concept has been brilliantly executed in a unique way, thereby making it special from the currently releasing movies,and hence allowing one to easily give it a rating of 8. I'd say that it is one of the very few movies where the futuristic world, though transformed with high-end technology, still has the poor whose lives aren't changed a bit. This contrasts scenes of the movies where the rich live in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Decent movie but this should have been a series,"This individual film is very interesting and fun to dig into but ""okay"". It lacks a presence of fear that war and horror should produce and instead develops a emotional foundation around a single character which limits the ability to display the true horror of the situation. It is fun to watch the idea of a common person become a idol (figure like superhero) and raise an league of fighters to defeat a villian. I do believe this series of movie is a cheap shot to tell this story and causes a shortcoming in the climax of the plot, silly twist that don't add creativity to the story, and a emotional depression that stigmatizes the actions of the actors. I do believe this should have been a episode base seasonal show that allowed for an expansion into the hunger games themselves and a lengthy war against the capitol with numerous battles carried out under numerous heroic figures. But, this series of films does set a stage for possible future spin offs involving the hunger games, it is my opinion that it is simple NOT the best option.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The movie did a wonderful job of explaining the story and situations to people that did not read the book. I thought they did a great job with the scenery, and the battle scenes. They added a few things in, but this in my opinion was a great way to build the suspense even more.Great actors/actresses! I thought Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson fit Katniss and Peeta perfectly. The others did a good job as well.I would recommend this to any person who is interested in this kind of movie.

The rest of the cast were amazing to, it was like they knew how to play the characters and you can tell that by their actions and facial expressions, such as Isabelle Fuhrman who plays Clove you could tell that she was dangerous body language.

Pretty good but could have Ben better,"OK so I'm going to start this review of by saying I had no clue what this movie was base on. After seeing a few previews months before its opening date, I felt it was going to be a different type of movie. One that we have not had in a good time. Now after I make my mind up on if or if not i will go see any movie I stop looking at previews and I do not look at the cast and crew. I feel it takes away from any surprise the film makers may have install for viewers. So now fast forward opening day I go online at 7am to check show times and they are sold out off all times in pretty much any place it was showing in manhattan, mind you it's 7am and I'm looking for tickets for 10 that day and there's nothing. So now I check for the next day witch is a Saturday all sold out up to 9:50 pm . Bam I buy 2 tickets for me and the lady, fast forward I get to the movies 2 hours before the movie starts to get good seats. I'm told to come back 45 min before the show starts because that's when they will start to let people in, I come back and hour later not 45 min and they let me I and there's almost 45 people in line, OK now I'm freakimg mad, but I did end up getting good seats for us. So now the Movie is about to start and yes there's people that can't just stop talking as always. 1st few minor the movie I really liked. They way they made her and everything look was very good. Jennifer played a great roll very strong but yet not over strong, Wes also played a good roll, wasn't to over powering so it rolled into her performance pretty good. The move effects were not as good as good as I felt they could have been. I mean it is after a book I would hope it will have everything it should have to hope top off good actors. I felt there was a lil time where the movie was dragging along and as it got to the end I also felt it was a short and not as good of one to over way the beginning witch as I said was pretty dorn good. So my review is its good enough to go see it you never read the book. If you did read the book maybe ull love it or maybe ull feel it's not as the book is and won't. But no matter if u have read the book or not ull walk out saying it was good at lest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Boring. A visibly dumbed Battle Royale down for kids.,"So, after all the hype, I just watched The Hunger Games and really wasn't impressed.It's basically Battle Royale dumbed down for kids. You could clearly see the intent to hide anything that would take it over the 12A/15 certification. Hell even Speed had more verbal and physical violence and that was a 15.I found it boring. The majority of scenes were silence or dubbed over with gently epic music.And, throughout, I couldn't help but feel that the whole moral premise was on par with The Only Way is Essex (TOWIE); In order to be successful, you must pander to socially acceptable rules, the way you look and are perceived are the only factors important in your social acceptance not what you can do.

Not having read the book I enjoyed it but far from great,"Over a week after seeing the film, giving me time to decide whether as good as the hype made it out to be, I am now ready to give my opinion. First-off The Hunger Games is a good film, whereby the cast are great, there is a sense of atmosphere and delivers what it promises. However, is it as good as how everyone hoped it to be? Well what is but this film has many flaws.While I can't blame a teen-oriented film for not showing the killing of multiple young people clearly, blood and everything, the director thought it would be better to zoom in hand-held camera with quick cuts so you never get a clear view to avoid offending its audience and receiving the 15/R rating. The overall effect is distracting and cheapens the film. If you intend to show something, then show it! The film's half-hearted attitude to the violence felt indecisive, not sure whether to stay true to the books or to make something family friendly.This is a much talked about issue and there is more that could be said, however the film does have its moments. Half the running time is set before the game begins and creates a tense atmosphere as the games move closer and closer. As mentioned the cast are great and the film allows time to develop their characters. Some scenes, particularly flashbacks, did feel poorly handled though and if more time had been spent developing them, I believe it would have improved the film immensely.As it stands, the film is good, however the direction is not all that strong. The climactic fight felt poorly handled, which is a shame since it also successfully developed the antagonist. Two CGI scenes were weak and did not add anything to film. While I did enjoy it, the film lacked a certain edge needed to keep me invested in what will happen next for the characters. Looking at the box office, hopefully the sequel will build on what this achieved and make up for its shortcomings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

May the Odds Ever be in Your Favour - my minireview,"There are plenty excellent dystopic movies, and even movies that feature killer kids like Battle Royale and A Clockwork Orange, which combined the two. The adaptation of The Hunger Games can stand alongside them with its head held high. The Hunger Games is a dark, grim movie that is brutal with its violence (or as brutal as a PG-13 movie can be) and a character-driven story that is brilliantly led by Jennifer Lawrence with a talented supporting cast. Gary Ross was able to bring us into this futuristic world and the use of shaky cam was a benefit not a hindrance. The Hunger Games shows a well-created world and society with plenty of ideas of its own about violence in the youth and reality TV. There was a Truman Show-like feel during the second half of the movie with the gamemakers manipulating the arena.

... I hate action movies,"I haven't read the books before I went in to see this movie. I didn't expect much, as I believed it to be yet another boring action movie. Well, I suppose it is an action movie (quite brutal at some stages - do not bring your kids!).... but it is so, so much more! I was glued on my seat the whole time. Partly because I was trying to understand what the hell was going on, how did something like this ever happen!!! The story line is beautiful, in a very sad and brutal kind of way. The acting is excellent, absolutely fantastic! After the movies, I went home at 10pm, and I started to download the kindle version of the second book straight away. I could not wait, I NEEDED to know what would happen next. I finished the book around 5 am. Went to bed, woke up at 8am to download the third book from amazon. I finished the third book the same day. I was still flabbergasted by the story line. I went to the cinema the next day again.... I am not sure if I can describe the heart ache I felt watching the story.I just finished the first book. I was surprised to see that the movie was SO close to the written story... like they just took all of the conversations word to word from the book! The love story is a little different in the book than it is in the movie. Honestly, the dude who plays Peeta - he acted so incredibly well, my heat aches thinking about his eyes when he looks at Katniss. How did he do this? I am still not sure what the books actually stirred in my. But 4 days later, I can still not shake it off... I would have enjoyed the movie more, if it would have been less brutal - but it would not have been the same! Also at first, I felt like some characters were somehow ""fake"", take Cato for example. I thought... he was somehow unbelievable, there was nothing human left in him. I changed my mind in the finale... he looked scared.I rambling.

A director that uses a shaky cam through out the whole movie...not just action in the movie, but mundane conversations...because of this i have avoided ross at all costs. Director's ego must be bugging him, jealous of the 'stars' and wants to put his 'stamp' on it. How I miss the old movies that had huge cameras that didn't move, the director let the actors act, and the scene composition set. Ebert was tired of queasy cam, i'm tired of it. It's a hack from television that ought to have stayed on the idiot box. This high school video class gimmick needs to be removed from a 'director's' toolbox. It's cheap, it's horrible.

Pretty excellent,"I have never read any of the novels that the film is based on. I was never really highly anticipating this film. I saw this weeks after it came out, with the hype already having died down. So after saying all of that, what do I get? A pretty excellent and viscerally exciting blockbuster.I think that the film does a very good job of being able to stand on its own two feet. It moves pretty quickly, but it never drags in any places. It also really does hold a lot of emotional impact. As the film goes on, we see more and more of the ""usual"" blockbuster trademarks, like music appearing especially louder in a ""sad"" scene. But it all works well. The film editing and cinematography are brilliant in the way they give the film it's tone and it's visceral excitement. A lot of people have complained about the cinematography especially, but I honestly loved it, and it's a big part of why the film worked so well.How about the performances? All pretty good. But this is Jennifer Lawrence's film. She was great in Winter's Bone, but here she develops her character in a much more fascinating fashion. I loved Winter's Bone, it's one of the best films of 2010, but I was one of the few who thought that Lawrence's performance had some weak points definitely. Here? Not at all, she manages to show her traits and her subtle emotional ticks much better. As it is, she's an actress to watch out for, and this is her best performance yet.Overall, I can't say everything in the film worked perfectly. I thought that the relationship between Peeta and Katniss was a bit forced, a bit awkward. I didn't completely buy it, then again I'm not so sure I was supposed to because I have heard book fans say they are ""faking"" it... could someone clarify on that? But as it is, this is great blockbuster entertainment, and a great film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Why you will or will not like the Hunger Games,"I went to watch The Hunger Games with a lot of expectation and excitement and left the cinema with an underwhelming feeling.Let me first clarify I have watched Battle Royale, I have watched the Condemned and the Running man you see the pattern thats being developed.The idea and concept of the Hunger Games is a good one, ( I wont go into detail as you can read that elsewhere).The major problem for me is I have seen Battle Royale and for me that is the same concept, but executed more efficiently. The problem with the Hunger Games is that it takes almost 70- 80mins before the movie kicks in. If you want a quick thrill ride this is not it, I understand its part of a trilogy but the idea seems to be a carbon copy of battle royale with its own spin.I have seen all the Battle Royale films and even the Condemned with Steve Austin is very similar to the Hunger Games.I guess if you have seen those don't bother watching, but if you haven't then the hunger games will be fresh and new for you.But for me it seemed like watching a movie I had already seen before.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
From The Eyes Of Someone Who Has Not Read The Book,"I wasn't really sure what to expect from The Hunger Games. I had heard of the books, but I never read them nor did I know anything about how much of a fan base it has until recently. As for the trailers, they didn't seem to really excite me; they didn't look bad, but it didn't really get me hyped up to see the movie. I'm glad I gave the film a chance, because honestly, this is probably my favorite film of 2012 so far.Now this film is directed by Gary Ross, director of Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, and while he hasn't directed many movies (he has written quite a few though), when he does direct he's actually really good. And same goes for The Hunger Games; he really did a good job of bringing this story to the screen. And he's also one of the writers of the story, along with Suzanne Collins (the book's author), and they both turn in a great script here, with great dialog, great story, and great characters. And this movie really gets you involved with what's going on, even for the minor characters. When a person dies in this movie, even if they've had less than five minutes of screen time, it was kind of shocking.Speaking of the characters, let's get to the actors. Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely amazing in this film, and not just in beauty (my future wife, ladies and gentlemen), she really can act. Now I've only seen her in X-Men: First Class and in this film (haven't seen her in Winter's Bone), but this is probably the best I've seen of her. She is outstanding. And while I'm not the biggest fan of Josh Hutcherson in the few films that I've seen him in (mostly kids movies so maybe that's why, he was never really given a chance to act ever), but here he does a really good job, and he's sort of like the underdog of the story. There are also some great secondary performances by Woody Harrelson, Wes Bently, Donald Sutherland, Lenny Kravitz, and Stanley Tucci. All of them do a great job, in fact there is probably not a single weak role in this film.And the action sequences are just fantastic in this film. There's been a few complaints about the use of shaky cam in the movie, but I think it actually made the scenes better because it really showed the intensity of the situation and the chaos of it all. And this movie is violent for PG-13, in fact there are a lot of bloody moments. This isn't something you should take your kids to see, young ones anyway. The pacing was also really good, and for a movie clocking in at almost two and a half hours, it felt neither too long or too short; it felt just right.The funny thing was that I thought this movie would get boring after the first half had passed through, because I was so wrapped up in just getting to know the characters and wasn't really interested in seeing the actually Hunger Games section of the story. But it caught me off guard; not only did the second half keep me interested, it got even more and more better as the film went along. It has been a while since I've seen a movie that did that to me. In fact this is so good, that I can't really say anything wrong about it. It just succeeds in every way that it should have. Check this movie out if you haven't already. Don't worry if you haven't read the books at all, you will enjoy this movie as well. I never read them, but I may now after watching this. And yes, this is my favorite movie of the year so far.I give The Hunger Games a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
going to keep this short and sweet,"The movie reminds me of the Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger from the 80s or 90s only this time staring teenagers. Having not read the book I can only say that the movie sets up its premise in a matter that is not quite believable. Unfortunately by the end I found that I was not much more attached to the characters than I was at the beginning.Bottom line: the acting is decent, the story somewhat predictable, the concept fairly novel to the mainstream audience (which seems to account for its success), and the movie is aimed at a teenage audience (who I believe would enjoy this more then me at my ripe old age of 28).I'm pretty surprised the movie was rated so highly by both critics and people here on IMDb.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Appetite for destruction depicted in fine form in ""The Hunger Games""","There is a movie that many moviegoers have had an appetite to chew on, and it's called ""The Hunger Games"". Heard of it? But of course you have, most of America and the world has not only heard of this movie but have already digested ""The Hunger Games"" with a cinematic viewing. I did that myself and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. Based on Suzanne Collins' best-selling novel, ""The Hunger Games"" takes place in the future where the Capitol selects a boy and a girl (called tributes) from twelve districts to fight to the death on live television; hopefully, not the future of reality shows even though some of them have already plagued many with superficiality syndrome. In the competition, there is only one winner and the rest of the twenty-three participants will be fatally eliminated which can make any of the twenty-four participants sick to their stomach in the hunger games competition. The movie stars Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, she is the arching aficionado who volunteers to enter the hunger games replacing her kid sister Primrose who was primarily selected as the District 12 female tribute. Josh Hutcherson co-stars as Peeta Mellark, the District 12 male tribute representative selected for the hunger games in order for the Capitol to get a taste of that Peeta bred. Director Gary Ross does not dress for less this movie by brilliantly capturing the film's pulsating tone of its Darwinism competition and depicting a future of an oxymoron-like colorful darkness. Collins, Ross, and Billy Ray's screenplay was not a utopia scribe, but it did hit the verbal bulls-eye in numerous scenes. Jennifer Lawrence's starring performance as Katniss was multilayered and magnetic! It was dead on! Maybe wrong choice of words, sorry Katniss! Hutcherson's work as Peeta was mediocre at its best or maybe it was because the Kitty Katniss was more delicious than the Peeta White Bread. Woody Harrelson was hey bitchin' in his supporting work as mentor Haywitch Abernathy, and provided some of the best lines in the movie; so another kudos there for the film's screenplay. Other tasty supporting performances in ""The Hunger Games"" include Elizabeth Banks as District 12 spokesperson Effie Trinket, Stanley Tucci as Hunger Games' master of ceremonies Caesar Flickerman, Donald Sutherland as Capitol President Snow, and Amandla Stenberg as District 11 child tribute Hue. But it was Lawrence's tour-de-force performance that filled me up the most with thespian pleasure in ""The Hunger Games"". OK, I know you have had enough of my pun tributes to this movie, so I will conclude my review. So in all, I think the odds are in your favor that you will enjoy ""The Hunger Games"". **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
i really liked this one,"good thing i didn't read the book, otherwise i probably would've come with much higher expectations. I thought the acting of the leading characters was good, i liked the bizarre costumes they wore but i think they could've gone further with that. I thought it was really suspenseful, there was definitely emotion to it. I would've liked Rue to be in the movie longer though to really grab the audiences connection with her. I don't think Katniss overreacted to her death though even though Rue as only in there for like 15 minutes. I think a lot of people would cry if they just saw a little girl get murdered for no reason in front of them. Overall i think it was very entertaining and i will be watching this again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"10 and out, but 10 and I'll try again","What's with the unsteady cam? Heck, I can hold any camera steadier than the camera work in The Hunger Games, without image stabilization. Is the cinematographer drunk?There's a place for hand-held cameras, and for the hand-held look, such as those faux crime scene TV shows. But at least they go for a Steadicam partially stabilized look. The scenes in The Hunger Games are deliberately jerked around.It looks gimmicky, and I get real suspicious of gimmicky pictures. Plus, the wobbly image gave me a headache, along with the too loud piercing music score. The combined effect is that while you are trying to figure out what the heck is going on, you can't hear yourself think.I figure the director needs to give me some reason to watch the movie within 10 minutes. I don't need to know everything, but I would at least like to see something interesting, and have the feeling the odds are better than 50-50 that I'm not going to be wasting my time. Is this too much to ask? Heck, most movies do this in five minutes.I was looking at another movie recently, The King of Marvin Gardens. It might be a good movie, but the beginning turned me off so much that I probably will never find out. And I'm a Jack Nicholson fan. I like artsy movies. But I don't like pretentious ones.I think the reviews also play a role. I can ignore a smattering of negative reviews and the usual stupid reviews. But there are also the glowing subsidized reviews, and the naive fawning reviews by people who have never seen a truly great picture, to discount. When what's left are people who say the movie is a waste of time, and the beginning is, indeed, a waste of time, not to mention highly unpleasant, why would I stay?I generally avoid the latest hit movie, When I haven't, when I've gotten dragged in, all too often I've been miserable, and then you have to pretend you liked the movie to avoid hurting someone's feelings, even if the movie made no sense. Heck, I've sat through movies in theaters by myself, wanting to get up and walk out, but I spent my money, and surely it is going to get better, I kept telling myself every 10 minutes, but it never did get better, and when I finally walk back into the sunlight I feel like I've just spent two hours in a Dumpster. So it is a great joy, with the wonders of modern technology, to be able to just press a button and put an end to movie misery.Gary Ross, you've made some truly great movies. I am all for experimentation, directors trying something new. I'm not going to write you off. But what I did see was awful.Maybe I wasn't the target audience for this movie. When I was the age of this target audience, I saw some great movies -- A Clockwork Orange, Barbarella, Easy Rider, 2001, Blow Up, Zabriskie Point -- movies that squares and old folks just didn't understand. There was a certain perspective that viewers brought to movies back then.Perhaps young people bring a certain perspective with them to movies these days. If they do, I wouldn't even know where to get it. But I still think those old movies are classics, viewed from the perspective of cold sober reality.Another thought: Is this movie some indication of the deep seated fears of young people these days of the world to come? If so, I feel sad. I am very afraid we are headed toward a dystopian future, due to human-caused global warming. But these real fears seem here to be displaced into some weird dystopian teen-centered fantasy world.And one last thought: This is the first time I have encountered a formal FAQ explainer of a movie on IMDb covering such questions as, ""What is 'Hunger Games' about?"" and ""What are 'Hunger Games'?"" If you need someone to explain these questions, apparently even after you've watched the movie, there is something wrong with the movie. I read the answers, and I still don't understand. Perhaps it is me.I tell you what, though. If in 10 years the reviews of The Hunger Games have improved significantly, I will give another try making it past the first 10 minutes, if in the meantime global warming hasn't destroyed the environment, producing wildfires, droughts, floods, plagues of locusts and other insects, disease, famine, extreme weather, political insurrection, world war and the collapse of what we laughingly call civilization.

Good movie even if you haven't read the book,"Jennifer Lawrence is wonderfully attractive throughout, whether she is hunting, running, fighting, in a red dress or in competition clothes. Her husky but feminine voice is enthralling. She carries the movie. Even though she's not a classic beauty she has a certain look that attracts the eye. But there is plenty other talent to entertain as well. Not having read the book I was surprised at who wasn't chosen to go to the competition from her village. But as the story unfolds its understood that it's being set up for a sequel. The sets and the futuristic setting is a nice add to an old story line. Some reviews have said that the story doesn't pay homage to the village starvation that the book spoke to. I think it's pretty evident but it's not dwelling piece in the story. I got the point well enough and don't think it was necessary to emphasize it more. There could have been more character interaction during the training period to set up the bad relations between contestants during the contest. The time does fly and I would have never guessed it was over two hours long although I did have to bow to the Big Gulp in the later half of the movie.

I read the book and this was a fantastic film!,"Unlike some of the reviewers that read the book and were unhappy with the film adaptation, I felt the movie did the book great justice. You can't expect the film to be exactly like the book and if they included everything in the book it would end up being a 5 hour film. Having read the book, I can tell you that some of the things that were omitted from the book were mainly due to having to keep the film at an acceptable length. The film even got the thumbs up from the author herself, which I think says a lot right there. I thought all the actors did a fantastic job....especially the wonderful Jennifer Lawrence. She is a rising star and for good reason. For a film that is over 2 hours, you will find that it flows easily and keeps your attention. I know many people that have already seen it 2 or 3 times. I strongly recommend this film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A very good adaptation,"After having read the books, I was very much looking forward to this movie. I must say, it did not disappoint me. The acting was good, the sets and costume design very well done, especially in the Capitol. It also did quite a good job following the book, while also doing a good job of making it available to those who hadn't read the books. People will complain about some characters being omitted, but these characters were very minor in the overall story-arch, and were necessary omissions to keep the movie at an acceptable length. In my opinion, the only real problem with this movie is the excessive use of shaky-cam. It was quite distracting at times, and usually was quite pointless. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Gods demand sacrifice. The Gods are always demanding sacrifice.,"If plain entertainment is your cup of tea and you are in your teens, and if you take lightly to kids killing kids in a game intended for entertainment for the masses, then go for it. Apart from some good acting by the pleasant looking Jennifer Lawrence, whose character development this movie revolves around, there is not much to commend in it. A shaky, inconsistent and incoherent plot, only a couple of good dialogs and jerky action scenes are what characterize it. There are no really good ideas in it, and a couple of very bad ones. The first bad idea is that a contest in which all but one of the participants are killed by the others can be called any sort of 'game' by any stretch of imagination. The correct term is clearly 'war' if the movie is to be taken seriously. (Perhaps in the post- postmodern dystopia words have entirely new meanings, or totally hazy meanings.) The idea that games can be a substitute for war is a good idea, but only if these games are not fatal, or are fatal only exceptionally. The other bad idea is that children are forced by lottery to participate in this death contest (notice that nobody volunteers, and the only exception is also motivated by the desire to save her sister). This is similar to the 'archaic man's' (Jung) worst habits of trying to please the gods by ritual human sacrifices that were almost never voluntary. The popularity of the Hunger Games books and now this movie could be that it stirs that archaic visceral excitement of seeing people being sacrificed as tribute or to please the powers that were presumed to be, so that those powers (gods) give the cult, community or tribe a bountiful harvest so that they don't go 'hungry'. Let me bring some rational balance here by pointing out that these archaic practices did work in exceptions, and only if a powerful person of the community sacrificed something voluntarily with a pure heart and impeccable motive. In all other cases, it was a perverse ritual that had bad consequences for the community, but which was not to be realized by the perpetrators of the ritual. Does watching this movie ring a bell?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dare I say...better then the book?,"I know this might be a knee jerk reaction but...The Hunger Games is my new favorite film of the decade! And I believe that's saying quite a bit considering this young decade has already provided us with films such as Inception, Black Swan, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Artist, and of course the 2 Part Harry Potter finale!Honestly, this film was fantastic. Incredible cast (Jennifer Lawrence has such amazing range and beauty), hard hitting emotion, and some really great adaptation choices. It's such a skillful adaptation of the novel's story of sacrifice and survival and does a fine job of retaining the novel's themes and satirical statements against violence, reality TV, etc while at the same time providing entertainment and genuine emotional impact. Oh how I wish all films were like this.All that being said, the film is not completely free of flaws (frankly I have yet to see a film that is though) however and there were times when I wanted to strangle either the director or cinematographer. The much discussed shaky cam is completely inappropriate at times (like before the games start) though quite effective at others. Also on the visual side of things, for a film that is going to rake in so much dough, some of the special effects could have been better. Oh, and yes, of course some things in the novel were left out but I think the film would have dragged if they had focused too much on life in the districts and not condensed the games a bit. On the other hand, as I said there was some really great adaptation decisions which fleshed out the novel in certain ways and made the film work even though it wasn't all first person POV like the novel. Also quite frankly I think a lot of scenes play out better on screen then they read, so I think the film is more then deserving of Best Adapted Screenplay consideration and maybe even Best Picture. Other award consideration should go to Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress, Woody Harrelson for Best Supporting Actor, and James Newton Howard for Best Original Score. Possibly Art Direction and Costumes as well. All I've got left to say is after this year's fiasco of virtually ignoring the fantastic final chapter of the Harry Potter saga, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences better take notice of this one; this is blockbuster film-making at its finest!For a richer experience you'll probably want to have read the novel though!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't take your children,"This is not the sort of experience I want in a Friday night let's-wind- down-at-the-end-of-the-week movie. When I read the storyline, I thought ""That's sick"" but then I watched the lovely young actors in the trailer and thought this could be fun. It wasn't. It was grim, dark and unredemptive, a kind of Orwell meets The Truman Show. So much in the movie was sickening and offensive – and disturbingly ironical. I was disgusted to see the hordes of gaudily painted adults crammed into the theatre waiting to be entertained by the killing of children, and realized uncomfortably part way through that this was exactly what I was doing. The juxtaposition of decadent opulence with abject poverty was obscene, yet it was nothing more than a true reflection of the extremes in our own real world. So please don't take your children if you're out for entertainment. The incidents of violence, though unpleasant, are nothing compared to two and a half hours of unrelenting dread and despair. You might on the other hand for a thoughtful discussion about the influence of media, reality TV and world economics, though if your family's anything like mine, their response is more likely to be ""Get over it Mum, it's just a movie"". There's no denying that this movie was a taster, an unfinished introduction to the series based on the books.

May The Odds Be Ever In Your Favor,"""May the odds be ever in your favor."" The Hunger Games is not just a movie of action and romance – it is a movie about survival of the fittest. The Hunger Games is about who can outwit the others. The Hunger Games is about finding your true self. But how can one find their self in a brutal attempt to please the one nation that created the games – The Capitol and the ruthless dictator of all time President Snow (played brilliantly by Donald Sutherland).With an all-star cast, directed by Gary Ross – who brought us Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, interwove the world that Suzanne Collins created. From Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) to Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) to Gale (Liam Hemsworth) to Cinna (Lenny Kravtiz), this movie defied all odds.I have nothing negative to say about this movie, it was a movie that will stand up against one other movie this year. A movie of a test of time standing still for one immortal girl, one immortal boy and clan that will have to meet their end in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2.But for The Hunger Games, thank you Suzanne for sharing your world with us.

Bring your own context,"I read these books with my two pre-teen sons. We all found them exciting, frightening, involving and above all, thought-provoking. I took them to see the movie without desperately high hopes because I usually find films of books I enjoy to be unrewarding or even just boring.Instead I found myself drawn in to the film. I thought the production - in particular the camera-work that has been criticized by many - was excellent in the way it drew me in to the scene, to the chaos, panic and fear that surrounds so many of the characters.As the film moved on, I became aware that there were points where other audience members were laughing - points that I found very serious or moving - and I began to realise that maybe as a movie in its own right it wasn't quite hitting the mark. Because I already know the characters and what moves them I was seeing things that weren't really there.After the film finished, this feeling continued to nag at me. Taken on the surface (as many media writers have done) this is a brutal film about children killing other children. Only once you are immersed in the characters and situations as they are drawn in the books does the real meaning of the stories become apparent - the themes of love, the corrupting influence of power, the bonds of family and so on. I felt comfortable reading the books to my kids because we could talk about these themes and see that the event of the Hunger Games is really just a device to explore them. I don't think the film really gives you that picture.In the end, I think Hunger Games is a good, faithful rendering of the storyline of the book and I really enjoyed it, but it fails paint the characters and the situation as well as it could. The unfortunate result of this is that it risks becoming the very thing it aims to criticize - a bloody circus.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Neither incredible, nor credible.","Having a weak spot for Jennifer Lawrence wasn't enough, at least not in my case. OK, this wasn't any of her strongest performances, but that wasn't the problem for me. For some reason, the story and the storytelling just didn't do it for me. Not only was it far from incredible, but most of the time it didn't even feel credible.The Hunger Games depicts a dystopian future by looking back in time, to the gladiator games of Roman times. Some of the scenes with Stanley Tucci, a very accomplished actor that I normally enjoy watching, gave me the feeling that the crew's understanding of Roman times was based entirely on Ridley Scott's Gladiator. Oh, and Mr. Tucci's character is called Caesar, by the way, if all the other references were too subtle. That can hardly be blamed on the film, however, since it was based on a novel by Suzanne Collins.Donald Sutherland was perfectly cast for his role, and he did his job well. Unfortunately, however, we didn't get to see much of him.All in all, the film was OK, but not something I would watch again.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loved it despite some minor plot changes,"Loved it I am a 23 year old who read the books over a year ago and loved them to death. I read all 3 in 3 days they were so good and so was very excited to see the movie. Its always interesting to see what view of the story the movie will take.Now I reread the book right before watching the movie and so I caught all the little changes. And yes the books are better than the movie but thats almost always the case.Despite all that it was a great movie, one that i would definitely watch again. The acting was great and whenever I read the books i will see Jennifer and Josh as Katniss and Peeta. They noted all the important aspects of the book though they didn't go into a lot of depth. Someone else commented that they didn't focus enough on Gale and Peeta's relationship with Katniss, but to me the romance triangle was never the primary point of the book, so it didn't bother me that much. Also seeing as it was already 2.5 hours, there wasn't much they could do. I hope they split the last the next two books into two movies a piece though.Overall the effects were great, lots of action, a great story line and great actors.

"""I want to show them that I'm more than just a piece in their Games,""","The Hunger Games is based of the novel by Suzanne Collins, and is the first in a series of books that are followed by Catching Fire and Mockingjay. I started reading the novels a few months ago when I first heard about the films and I have loved all three of the books, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. Now before I go onto the review I need to go over some of the preconceived notions about the film and books going around in movie reviews and the internet. The first is that the books and film are a rip off of manga series Battle Royal. For some reason fans of the series thinks the manga is an original idea when it isn't. I've read the manga. Years ago my older brother introduced me to the manga series. I enjoyed it for what it was a violent manga with great action, but not much else behind it. The story was lacking and so were the characters. As for the originality of the series it takes its ideas from great books and films like Lord of the Fly and Ender's Game among others, so saying that Battle Royal is original is laughable. When are people going to learn that it is virtually impossible to find a truly original idea anymore. What it comes down to is execution, bringing your own take on the idea and making it your own. Suzanne Collins does that The Hunger Games and her series of books using an idea that has been used before and making it her own in which she created a great and dark futuristic dark world with flawed and likable characters. The second thing I hear about is how the novel is geared down tween girls and these comments from people who actually haven't read the books. I've read the novels and I'm a man and in my early thirties, and I don't think they're geared for girls in their early teens. In my opinion this is geared for everyone. It's a dark series especially Mockingjay that deals with child on child violence, children forced to sell their bodies, war and torture among the other themes in the books, so saying the novels are truly geared for teen girls is just wrong. Finally we have the comparison to the Twilight books. For some reason reviewers and the public and general are overstating the romantic element in the novels and the so called love triangle between Katniss, Gale and Peete. It's nothing like Twilight, which I tried to read but couldn't because it was really bad. First of all unlike Twilight some crappy romance isn't the main driving force in the novels. Second there isn't a love triangle especially if you've read or have gone on to read the other two books. It comes down to Katniss and Peete. Collin's made that pretty clear in the novels. They are after all the two most important characters in the book. Katniss who will do almost anything to survive and the kind hearted Peete who doesn't want to let the Capital to change him and the confusing and growing relationship between the two. All right I'm done with my rant. I really got to stop surfing the internet or going to certain sites, and now onto what I thought of the film.As I've said I've read the novels before seeing the film, but I'm not one of those people who'll penalize a film if it's not a perfect copy of the novel. The Hunger Games film adaptation is a great film to put it mildly, but in my opinion it's an excellent film. The best I've seen in recent memory. I think since Inception a few years ago. I won't go to in-depth into the plot of the film since it might spoil the film for those who haven't read the novel. It takes place sometime in the distant future after some kind of world war/disaster which caused the collapse of the United States and North America, and what rose from the ashes was Panem. Panem has a president but it's more of an empire then a republic. Years before the novel the thirteen districts of Panem rose up against the Capital but lost with the destruction of district 13. After the war the Capital forced the districts obedience by holding annual games in which a boy and girl from each district from the ages 12 to 18 are randomly picked and forced into game/reality show in which they children must kill each other and there can be only one winner. You don't need to read the books to enjoy the film as it's pretty easy to follow. As for the film adaptation of the book its stays pretty close to the book. There are a few people cut from the film. The mayor's daughter Madge Undersee and Peete's parents cut from the film. I shouldn't say they were cut since I don't know if they were edited out or just not added. Then there is Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) who they didn't wasn't introduced in the film like he was in the movie. I didn't mind the small deviations from the novel and I liked what they added in place. The added a behind the scenes take on the film. Showing the head game master Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) as he views the games along with his interaction with president Snow (Donald Sutherland).Sadly there's a word limit for reviews here. If you want to see my full review go to Movieweb.com and look under the name Huntsman. Otherwise this is a great film and should be seen by everybody.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Visually amazing, but hollow.","Spoiler Warning! I went into the film with such incredible expectations and as a huge fan of the book series. The film was good, but did not quite meet my expectations. I feel that as far as casting, direction, and effects it was pretty spot on. The way the movie was filmed added a lot of drama and suspense. I don't think a single person wouldn't have their heart pounding as Katniss raises up into the arena! I will definitely say that the movie up until the point of the Game starting cannon going off was spot on. The emotion and plot were almost exactly what were in the book. I wish the meaning of the Mockingjay pin had been explained and that Katniss' relationship with Peeta had been a little more developed. In the book she is a lot more conflicted on whether to trust him or not and in the film she just appears to not like him. Haymitch was also a little nicer than he was in the book. In the book you are never sure if he likes Katniss or not.As far as the games were concerned: it just felt way too rushed. There should have been less scenes outside the arena and more focus on developing the characters within the games. There was no time to develop Katniss' relationship with Rue or even Peeta for that matter. By the end of the Games in the book, the reader is very convinced that Katniss really does love and care about Peeta but that she's just not fully aware of it. By the end of the games in the movie you really aren't convinced she cares for him at all.The cave scenes were too short not because we wanted more romance... but because those are the scenes where Katniss' tenderness shines through and where you really get to know Peeta. The whole plot line with his leg was completely botched. He was supposed to have a gaping hole in his leg that required medicine to heal blood poisoning. He was supposed to be on death's door. Katniss' retrieval of the medicine was not as heroic if you didn't believe he was dying.Finally the ending was just not dramatic! Peeta was supposed to be bleeding to death because of a wound from one of the mutts. They cut out my favorite scene when they are lifted into the hover craft and Peeta is whisked away for surgery. Katniss goes berserk, not knowing what's going to happen to him and you are really convinced she does in fact love and care about him. In the film he doesn't lose his leg, that scene is completely cut out, Katniss and Peeta don't appear scarred or as if they have been through anything traumatic. Their reunion is nowhere near convincing that they are in love. If I lived in the Capitol... I would not have been convinced.Overall, I was pretty disappointed. Not that I need violence to enjoy a movie, but the horror of the games just wasn't portrayed convincingly enough and just hope and pray they do an even better job with Catching Fire.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good. Quite a bit of action, but left as all setup for a series.","Thought it was good. My kids (boys 9 and 10) enjoyed it as well. Action kept it moving along but in the end it felt like it was all setup for a series. Lots of focus on the main character and it did well enough to explain her background in the mining district 12. She's a very like-able character, but really the only one that gets any development of any sort. The action itself isn't overly gory, although it does take a level of understanding from the kids that children are going to die. I did not think they did enough to explain *what* was evil to warrant killing children in the plot. In the end, the plot is about survival and the kids got that.

Best adaption of a book to film yet!,"I am usually very picky as I love a good movie and have usually read the book beforehand if it is an adaption.

It had everything that I loved about the book and the screenplay's omissions and additions where appropriate and sometimes brilliant.Also I was worried about Hollywood watering down a female lead character, or changing her personality to match expected social norms. They did not. She is totally Katniss. The characters where all very good.I was so impressed with everything overall.

Stop Shaking the Damn Camera,"Who'd have ever thought that the USA would have to import its violence. But its true. In the quest to ever lower the bar for how far Hollywood will go to grab a buck, they finally made a movie about children slaughtering each other with a PG-13 rating.How did they accomplish this? By shaking the camera mercilessly and never showing any actual penetration. In effect, its about as violent as any three stooges movie without the zany sound effects. Dogs mauling kids; either off-screen or in the shadows. Killer wasps; more shaky camera work and muddied CGI. If it wasn't for the cannon blasts signifying the deaths of the contestants, there would be no way to know what happened to most of the characters in the arena.I'm not saying this movie is stupid, its actually pretty good. Its just not a good action film and its almost too juvenile for what should be a more dramatic piece. The violence is all done off-screen or through the use of shaky cameras so there's no sense of imminent danger. The other sacrifices are ignored so entirely that there's no feeling that the main character wouldn't make it to the end. There is a scene where a friend of the main character is impaled with a spear and there is no weight to the scene or the memorial scene that follows, its just another minor character dying off screen.This movie is more of a satire on reality TV game shows, but they don't do enough viewer reaction to important scenes (as they did in The Truman Show) to really monopolize on that satire. Only one scene attempts to capture that moment, but the gestures expressed between the character in the game and the audience are lost to those that haven't read the book. If you wish to find a better satire of reality TV game shows and socially acceptable violence, I recommend the movie Death Race 2000 with David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone.The best reason to see this movie is Woody Harrelson's character of a psychologically damaged and alcoholic winner from a previous tournament. He steals the show in every scene he's in.Its good, but it could have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Intriguing,"I saw the Hunger Games yesterday, and although I have read the books, I think the movie is spot on. What they cut made sense, what they added made sense. But most importantly, I watched something that worked as a movie, not just as an adaptation. Imagine my surprise as I was leaving the theater pretty satisfied (I'd give it a 8/10 at that time), and hear someone comment that it was ""pretty boring, and there are still two others to come? What will the movies be about if the games are already over?"", and I realized how the movie might come across to some people: an action movie with a sexy female hero and typical cartoon villains trying to kill her. But that was not the point of the movie at all. It's not a story about Katniss (the main character), violent games and romance on the side. It's a story about oppression. And a pretty good one at that.The Capitol creates the Hunger Games with the objective of ending rebellions before they begin. They make the twelve districts remember, each year, how powerless they are to act against the capitol, and also makes the districts hate each other instead of the capitol by making one district's teenagers kill the other's. Then Katniss comes and semi- unintentionally turns the system around by starting to bring unity to the districts instead of distrust, and at the end of the movie exposes how fragile the whole system actually is.""Do you know why we have a winner? Because the only thing more powerful than fear is hope. A small spark is fine as long as it's contained"" - That quote by the ""evil"" president Snow summarizes the premise of the movie. Katniss is that spark; she knows that rebelling won't end well for her and her family, but she still ends up accidentally (or is it?) bringing hope to the districts by showing them that they can, indeed, fight against the capitol - whether she wins the games or not is incidental. And that is why this movie, actually, this story, is genius.That was just on the story part, though. I have seen a lot of people comment on 2 things (aside from the boredom from lack of action thing which I already commented about above): the shaky camera and the ""horrible costumes and make up"". The camera is indeed shaky, but the friends that watched the movie with me didn't even notice it; I only noticed it because I was looking for it (read too many reviews before watching it). If it bothers you that much, then I guess you won't like it, but your mileage may vary. As for the costumes and make up, it's supposed to be like that. That's their fashion sense. The book emphasizes that for Katniss, they look hideous.Another thing that I found rather interesting were the people saying that Cato and the Career tributes (tributes who train their whole lives and volunteer for the games) were bad because they were just typical bully evil jerk villains. Villains? Were they? Out of the 24 tributes in the arena, who all have the same goals, to kill all the other tributes, some are considered evil and some aren't? This is exactly what I was talking about when I said that some people missed the point; the fact is that the villain wasn't the other tributes, the mutations, etc. It was the capitol, and the fact that many people forgot about the capitol and just took the other tributes as enemies just proves how the scenario described in the movie is not so unbelievable as it seems to some.In the end, instead of the 8 I was going to give it, I had to give it a 10 after I saw how many people missed the point of the movie, and that made me realize the story was much deeper than I thought. If you go to this movie expecting an unending action scene with a simple, obvious plot, or if you don't like shaky cameras, you will be disappointed. This movie definitely isn't ""easy watching"", and you have to pay attention and read between the lines for it to make sense, and come into the theater with an open mind to enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Contains some stunning scenes and images, but also uneven","This review is being written on the morning of March 31, 2012, when the initial hype for the movie has died down a little and the hatchet job reviews have started popping up here on IMDb.Suzanne Collin's novel, written in 2008, tells an intricate and evocative story. In broad terms, the United States approximately one to two centuries into the future has become a dystopic totalitarian regime divided into twelve districts. The governing body called ""The Capitol"" has devised ""The Hunger Games"" as a way of quelling rebellions and keeping the populace in line. Twenty-four children (a boy and a girl from each district) between the ages of 12 and 18 are randomly chosen to fight to the death in a massive outdoor arena, until only one survives.The novel triumphs because the author manages to capture a dystopian universe through the eyes of a rough-hewn 16 year-old-girl who is both the product of her time and amazingly resourceful. Since the book has had so much success and is read largely by high-school age children, it's easy to dispatch it into the ""Twilight"" category of ""fad"" fiction. Yet Suzanne Collins is an experienced, successful television writer and it shows. By contrast, even author Stephanie Meyer admits that the ""Twilight"" books are far from literary masterpieces.Now onto the challenge in filming ""The Hunger Games:"" the filmmakers have to take a story with a first-person viewpoint and tell it in third person objective. Some reviews have criticized the lack of story development into the mores of the dystopian society but they have missed one important detail: author Suzanne Collins was part of the screenplay team and was still trying to tell the story through Katniss' eyes in the best way she could. Let's face it: no matter how educated or rough-hewn they may be, a sixteen year old is just not going to have much world experience yet.""The Hunger Games"" best moments occur during the pomp and pageantry that precedes the games. To use too much detail in describing it would be to court spoilers, so suffice it to say that the images of Katniss and Peeta arriving in a chariot are stunning and unforgettable. Katniss interview with Caesar the emcee is also striking and taken almost verbatim from the book.Most other reviews fail to appreciate the great work of the Art Direction team in creating the Capitol. The exhibition hall where the interviews for the tributes take place shows a crowd layout and architectural detail that eerily mimics the Nuremburg rallies during the Nazi era in pre world war 2 Germany. Taking it a step further, the Reaping scene near the beginning shows the youths dressed in bland, demure clothing straight out of a Hitler youth rally.During the ""games"" themselves, the movie becomes a somewhat bland action thriller. This brings up another problem which faced the producers: to truly reflect the strife Katniss and Peeta faced, the movie would have had to have been at least twice as long. Katniss' relationship with Rue, one of the best parts of the novel, also suffers in the story streamlining for cinema. On top of everything else the producers also downplayed and sanitized the violence to secure a PG-13 rating.As many have also reported, the ending seemed flat but there's a rhyme to that reason: the makers are clearly springboarding to one or possibly two sequels. Still, if you're on the fence about whether to pay $11 to $13 to see this in theaters, just go. ""Hunger"" is good cinema, with fine performance by all the principals and a movie that in the end asks a disturbing question: ""Is this what we're heading toward?""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Such a disappointment...,"I wanted to like this movie so much... i liked the books, and although it's clear teenagers are their specific target i though they could make a watchable movie for the rest of us.... i didn't expect they would absolutely destroy all that was good in the book, the relationships between the main characters, the forces that move them, the doubt, the confusion, the hard choices they must make... although a bit shallow already in the book in the movie is unbearable... it's been sad to see that instead of developing more interesting angles to it, they have completely destroyed a good opportunity of developing intense scenes and have opt for this shallow, action wannabe, shadow of a movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but many flaws,"The Hunger Games is a amazing and dramatic movie to watch. Everything that was written in the book was finally put into the big screen. The scenes picked for the movie are great and completely match the description in the book.

Another problem was that the movie was kind of rushed, I barely had a chance to catch a glimpse of some parts of the movie which still urges me to watch again and it's a waste of money to watch it again.If you want to watch The Hunger Games, I guarantee that you will experience a dizzying and partially confusing movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Before you go see the movie; READ THE BOOKS.,"Hello ! :3 The Hunger Games (the book) is an amazing thing and there is not one person I know who hasn't loved them. You just cant put the book down, and when finished, you just feel the need to read them again. Like all the other fans of the book; I was super excited to see the movie, and I loved it! But! If you want to see the movie, you should defiantly read the books first, you will understand the costumes, sets (background),characters and dialogue more if you do, otherwise it may not make a lot of sense. The 'Shaky camera' was just to create the illusion that you are running, in the arena, with Katniss. When we are running, does our vision stay perfect? This movie (and the book) is raw; it faces the facts about reality TV, and poor human treatment. The cast is perfect. Jennifer Lawrence does a fantastic job at bringing Katniss to the big screen; opposite other skilled actors and actresses. Even the youngest of the cast; Amandla Stenberg, and Willow Sheilds do a great job in this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the Hunger Games, and am thankful that it is very true to the book! Read the books THEN see the movie; trust me!You will love and enjoy the movie more if you have the knowledge from the books. And now! I must be off! May the odds be EVER in you favour. and remember!

Brilliant film,"Makes me angry seeing one stars, and poor ratings, this film is really good, best film I've seen in 2012, the ending is a bit predictable, when they have to kill one of the other- of course the Berry's would pop out the pocket, and the ending was a bit strange where much didn't happen, properly because a new film will come out soon but this is a great film i have seen for a long time, along with 21 jump street, shutter island etc, this film deserves a rating around the 8.5 mark, when you see films rated on this site, so badly marked higher for example poltergeist is awful OVerall brilliant film, worth going to watch again!!i watch 3 films a night, and this is far one of the best I've seen! i highly recommend people going to watch this film,",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It might be good for teenagers,"First of all, i didn't read the book, then i don't know if it follows the book story or not. But what i can tell is that this movie roams around a love triangle with a violence deploy at the background. This is the first fault, because i was expecting the other way. I mean, the title is ""The Hunger Games"" and not ""Love in the Hunger Games"". Maybe teenagers, specially female ones would love this, but not me. The next fault is the shaky shoots, why are there shaky shots on action takes? This movie is not documentary style, nor first person view, so why?Now the good of it, thats why i gave a 6, photography is good, good special effects, as for makeup and digital (except when takes are shaky), acting is good, and music is good too.In short, the movie kept me entertained, made me dizzy some times, and not expectant for next part",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best movie I have ever seen!,"This film is truly amazing- with its deep, well thought out plot, brilliant characters and breathtaking sets, The Hunger Games is not a movie you are likely to forget. It has strong morals behind it- making people realise the cruelty of humans through deeply emotive scenes. The screenplay is riveting- every second counts; although it is quite a lengthy film, I simply did not want it to end! This promises to be an outstanding new series of films (with 3 more on the way), that although quite dark in context, is suitable for a wide audience. And for people who are worried about it being aimed at teenagers too much, (what with the love interest of the main character, Katniss) they do not need to worry- it is portrayed perfectly and not in any way overdone- the story is believable and it all plays a part in a much deeper plot, that will leave you ruminating about this fantastic movie for days after you have seen it.

Epic adrenaline rush of a film,"I'll start this off by letting everyone know that I've never so much as picked the Suzanne Collins book up. I had no idea there was a book called ""The Hunger Games"" until I saw the trailer for this film. I don't know why, but something about this movie stuck out to me upon my viewing of the trailer. Maybe it was the premise of teenagers brutally fighting to the death as a game and tradition, or maybe it was how the movie clearly demonstrates the unbreakable love between siblings. But for whatever reason, I knew I needed to see this film.I went with a friend of mine who had read the book. She assured me the book was fantastic, and she was sure I'd love the movie as long as it followed the book. After it was over and I asked her how closely it followed it, she seemed a bit disappointed. But, having no previous knowledge, I didn't find many major flaws in this film.Jennifer Lawrence is a fantastic young actress. Her performance in the great Winter's Bone was remarkable, and she doesn't disappoint here either. She plays our protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, who takes her young sister's place in The Hunger Games, a brutal but traditional game where 24 teenagers battle to the death while the entire country watches. The action scenes are tense and awesome, and Katniss proves herself to be an extremely intelligent player as the games go on, finding clever ways to pick off opponents. Lawrence's portrayal is really a joy to watch, as is the film itself.Look out for a decent acting turn from Lenny Kravitz as well, as well as a strong performance from Josh Hutcherson. It is these performances that make the movie special, and make it such a thrilling and enjoyable film. I cannot speak as a fan of the book, but as someone who loves to watch a good movie, I was very pleased with this one. And if you are a fan of smart, clever action-fantasies, you shouldn't feel any differently.Overall: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Decent but unspectacular YA adaptation,"With the Harry Potter films over and Twilight concluding soon, Hollywood has filled the financially lucrative void with its latest Young Adult series adaptation, The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a stronger than the first Harry Potter film, but is still only a decent but unspectacular film, with a lot of ideas at the core, but not quite mining them all to success.The film opens at some point in the future, where society has collapsed and the country is split into 12 impoverished districts while the control is located in the resplendent Capitol. In the past, the Districts had rose up against the Capitol, but had been put down, and as punishment The Hunger Games was born: a televised competition where one boy and one girl from each district are chosen annually to fight one another in a bloody tournament where only one survivor can go home. From District 12, Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) is selected, but her older and tougher sister, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to take her place. Also selected from District 12 is Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who holds a secret crush for Katniss.At the Capitol, they participate in a series of training exercises and public ceremonies leading up to the games, groomed by Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) to create a memorable impression on the crowds whom they will rely on as potential sponsors for weapons and supplies during the games. They are also given survival guidance by Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), the last winner from District 12 who is now a lush, using his position largely as an opportunity to avail himself of food and drink. Katniss quickly proves an impressive find, and gamemaster Seneca (Wes Bentley) tries to influence President Snow (Donald Sutherland) to make a few adjustments to the games due to her, but Snow is not so taken, seeing her strength and willpower as dangerous. When the games are finally underway, in a wooded landscape, Katniss must summon all her strength and resourcefulness to survive the elements and her fellow players.You would have to have been living under a rock for the last decade or so to not recognize the Hunger Games is a cautionary tale about modern reality TV taken to the Nth degree. It is most successful when the characters are being featured on a talk show, hosted by an over-the-top Stanley Tucci, which resembles today's fluff interview programs such as The Tonight Show and Entertainment Weekly, biting satire which hits the mark. Tucci and his co-anchor, portrayed by Toby Jones, commentate and reflect on the games as if people's lives weren't in the balance, giving us a glimpse at what could, unfortunately, be our future. Unfortunately, the background of the dystopian world the characters live in is underdeveloped, leaving a lot of questions concerning how the Capitol maintains control of the people unexplored.The Hunger Games doesn't really tread any ground that hasn't already been well-worn by other works, including The Running Man, Battle Royale and more. The idea of man's inhumanity to man being treated as entertainment is certainly not groundbreaking, but in the world of YA literature, it seems, everything old is new again. However, the decision to go for a PG-13 rating dulls the film's potential edge. While it doesn't completely shy away from the violence inherent in the story, shaky camera motion and quick edits keep the audience at arm's length from the true viciousness of the concept that is really worth exploring.The film also suffers from a bit too much from archetypal characters. Katniss and Peeta are both somewhat naive, innocent and inherently ""good"" individuals. Aside from a young girl named Roo (Amandla Stenberg) who is befriended by Katniss, almost all the rest of the participants in the games are bloodthirsty jackals, reveling in the murder of the others. Most of them are merely fodder for the story's eventual parade of death, but the few that stand out are ""evil"". We can't help but root for our heroes, they are among the only relatable people in the story. As with other stories targeted at a teen female audience, there is the seemingly inevitable love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and another boy from District 12, Gale (Liam Hemsworth). For the most part, though, this is just window dressing to the film, a storyline that may have more meat in the source novel, but here lacks depth. Gale and Katniss relationship doesn't have any chemistry to it, and Hemsworth's scenes are minimal. Katniss and Peeta's relationship isn't any deeper, and several of the scenes where they begin to connect romantically are manipulative and ineffective. The two don't come across as being attracted to each other, but merely going through the motions the screenplay has laid out for them.Jennifer Lawrence, who came to notice from her work in Winter's Bone, impresses as Katniss. She provides us with a girl who is alternately strong, scared and thoughtful. She is the film's anchor, and when the Hunger Games works in its second half, it is often due to her performance. Surprisingly, the most engaging relationship in the film is between Katniss and Cinna, with their parting scene one of the emotional high points. Josh Hutcherson does give Peeta a nice dose of naivete, but he proves a tad underwhelming in the role. Stanley Tucci chews the scenery with great aplomb in his moments, Wes Bentley comes across as a man who is a bit too easily manipulated for his own good, and Donald Sutherland gives President Snow and quiet degree of menace.I give credit to The Hunger Games for addressing ideas and issues relevant to the current state of society, but the package that it is delivered in ultimately proves a bit underwhelming. With the ground- work laid, perhaps the next installment will be a stronger film and build on the base of The Hunger Games.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Why this film was successful, my personal opinion.","I think the success of the book and consequently the success of the film are due to the author combined in a creative and convincing a subject so current and as present as it is the reality show, with a time of human history, more precisely the time of the Roman Empire, and I'm not saying you have to know history to enjoy the movie, but the film is convincing precisely because they are inspired by events that really happened, and knowing that human beings tend to repeat past mistakes. The film is excellent, still recommend to those who did not read the book in which it is based, do so because it complements, not only adding situations that do not appear in the film but also helps to understand how the character feels or thinks at certain times. The choice of actors is sublime, the best I remember at this time. In my opinion, the character of Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, Caesar, Snow, Seneca Crane, Effie, Prim, Cinna, Rue, well, basically all but minor roles are well represented, although some may are not great actors. I have read some reviews that do not agree to the following, but in my opinion, the setting of the film is remarkable.

This is definitely out there,"A 'Hunger Games' virgin would be bewildered at the concept of the story. Importantly however, the film is given context and grounding for those who have not read the novels making it comprehensible as a story, even if you don't warm to it as a premise.Reading a novel, specifically one full of minute details which can make a large difference to perceptions, will almost always supersede the film if every detail is not treated appropriately and as a 'virgin', you get the impression that there remain some grey areas and potential plot holes, but nothing leaves you utterly perplexed. Ultimately though, you come to realise that the 'Hunger Games' is not as much about cruel commerciality than about hope and inspiration in a dystopian, empire type world. The plot becomes more sophisticated and grows on you with time.The realm itself is depicted magnificently in a futuristic, fantastical and fashionable way, the latter part being most peculiar yet still visually appealing. The usage of CGI was brilliant in highlighting the stark contrast between the dictatorial, advanced 'Capitol' and the backward, subordinated 'Districts'.Such young adult novel film adaptations are often fraught with castings of young 'hunks' or 'princesses' who are on the screen more for looks than acting but this film sets itself apart through some particularly good characterisation from Jennifer Lawrence ('Katniss Everdeen') as well as old timers such as Elizabeth Banks ('Effie Trinkett') and Woody Harrelson ('Haymitch Abernathy'), both of whom portrayed oddball, quirky sort characters which needed some thinking out of the box.Certainly, fanatics of the novels would be more than pleasantly receptive towards the cinematic adaptation but expect non-fanatics to be walking out of the film thinking 'what was that all about?' It's definitely unique and beats 'Twilight' on screen hands down, but the content still remains a touch overwhelming and outlandish for 'virgins'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Gripping and well paced,"Let me begin my review by saying that I haven't read the books, and as such I had no preconceived notions going into the theatre. From reading some of the more negative reviews, I think this may have a lot to do with how I feel about this movie.I found the world that this film constructed mesmerising. It immediately engaged me at both an intellectual and emotional level. Being a guy who normally has a lot of space between his thoughts and his emotions, this is a rare and welcome surprise in a movie. You immediately connect with the plight of the people in the District's and develop a curiosity as to how the city folk live. When their opulence, disconnection and disregard for other people becomes clear, your hatred for the system that Katniss, Peeta and the others have to live under becomes almost palpable. Heck, I was practically ready to cry out for and end to the inhumanity, inequality and injustice right there in the theatre and start a revolution! On several occasions I actually felt horror and upset when some of the younger characters are killed and hatred for the characters that would kill younger children with little regard. I don't think that you have to be an intellectual or political person to feel this way. I imagine the books are so popular because they tug at our own intrinsic sense of compassion and humanity and if this is the case, the movie does an amazing job of transferring that to the silver screen.The script was somewhat minimalist and fast moving in my opinion. It feels like anything that didn't further the narrative was cut. Every scene contributed something and seemed to be another important development or milestone in the story.As far as the casting is concerned - I can't really compare the actors chosen to the way that they were described in the book and as such I had no real expectations as to how the actors needed to look in order to fit the part. However, I will say that I was struck immediately by the depth of character that Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) managed to portray. I felt immediately that the character being portrayed was a rare kind of woman - a strong, determined and exceptionally intelligent leader. Lawrence's performance has an immediacy and a directness to it, verging on a minimalism which is strikingly effective and is the kind of performance that I feel is marginalised in today's world of over-acting and over-reacting in every scene.The other main part, certainly in terms of screen time, is played by Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark). Again I think this is a solid performance and I bought into the character portrayed, finding him convincing as a potential partner to Katniss as well as a key driving force in their survival. Some people seem to be complaining that he doesn't fit the big and strong description given (apparently) in the books. Personally, however, I actually find that couples that appear too picture perfect become less believable. If anything, the fact that he at times appears slightly smaller than Lawrence lends their relationship a kind of reality, in a story that is ultimately about depth of character, that I feel is far too often missing from Hollywood and its fake plastic world. Life is messy and very rarely picture perfect, and if a movie about the tragedies of death, the horrors of poverty, oppression, inhumanity and war can't reflect that then what can? By accident or design I think Hutcherson's casting is actually a good thing.I don't have time (or available word limit remaining) to review all of the other factors that went into this movie in detail. Suffice it to say that I thought every actor on the screen was excellent and delivered believable performances with real depth of character. The effects were minimal but well used and the way that the world drew on both Ancient Roman/Gladiatorial and Nazi architecture and imagery to reinforce the dystopian nature of the society was a nice touch.Overall: a fast paced film with great acting and an intrinsically moving and well represented story line. Go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Hunger Games,"The Hunger Games, directed by Gary Ross, lived up to its hype by showcasing intense characters, detailed costume designing, and an inventive atmosphere that truly brought the book to life. The novel, The Hunger Games, written by Suzanne Collins, mesmerized me in the two days that I spent reading it, and by being so infatuated by the book, I prayed that the film would accentuate that same excitement. Fortunately for me, the movie did just that, and director Gary Ross used his touch of brilliance to create a nail biting film that captured the novel's themes of love, war, and hope. Although the movie exceeded two hours in length, it contained no uninteresting segments and the plot moved smoothly and efficiently. The three main characters in The Hunger Games, Katniss, Peeta, and Gale, were convincingly portrayed in the movie and the personality traits of each character were articulated and evident in their actions. As Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence was the fierce, skilled, and intelligent young woman that the book described, and the big screen allowed Katniss' character to truly flourish. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson, who played Gale and Peeta, made a perfect supporting cast, and the duo helped bring Katniss' contrasting qualities of toughness and femininity to the forefront. The multiple settings of the movie were exactly what I had pictured while reading the book, and I loved how director Ross captured the desolation of District 12, the flamboyance of the Capital, and the treacherousness of the arena. Overall, I enjoyed the movie because of its realistic effects, its adherence to the novel, and its ability to keep me at the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. It is rare to witness a movie that forces oneself to meditate on the plot after leaving the theater, but this film involved elements of culture, politics, and morals that provided food for thought. I am happy to say that The Hunger Games did live up to its hype, and after seeing the movie, I am keenly anticipating the sequel, Catching Fire.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but overrated,"Firstly, I haven't read the book, and I judge a film on its own merits which is a good thing. I tend to be able to overlook the hype. Having said that, the film lacks in a few things. 1. the plot was too forced, there were moments that could've been built up better. 2. The use of shaky camera was too much and added to the 'forced' feel of the film. This is the main problem with directors who do this. They don't seem to get that viewers need to SEE what's going on to get into the story, and it's blurry it doesn't engage them, it has the opposite effect. 3. The emotional highpoint of the film was a scene with a minor character, not when Katniss volunteered instead of her sister or the ending, which it should've been. It lacked emotion where it counted. The pacing also could've used a bit of tightening, especially the scenes in the forest. The good parts: plot was engaging and good performance from Jennifer Lawrence, and the action is not bad. All in all, worth watching but it's not what it's hyped up to be.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much ado about an okay movie...,"First, I have not read the book. I saw the movie last Monday night in Los Angeles at the World Premiere. The movie was just okay. It wasn't bad...it just wasn't something I would want to see again nor get excited about the sequels. The production values are good and I liked the acting. But seriously, even though I haven't read the book, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know how it's going to end since sequels had been made/planned. I really did like Jennifer Lawrence it in and am amazed how she and the rest of the cast look nothing like their characters. I hope fans won't be disappointed. It did make me want to rent Battle Royale since the storyline sounds so similar. Maybe I'll like that movie better since it didn't have a sequel and might keep me more engaged.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely worth a watch!!!,"I knew nothing about this film until a few days before its release and when I heard it was going to be like Battle Royale I instantly looked into it. Discovering that the film was to be a 12A I was rather shocked and put off by the fact that a film like this could be rated that low, but nevertheless was still determined to watch it.I must say that I'm glad that I did. The acting throughout the film is superb! The emotion of the characters really gives different parts of the film distinctive moods that entices you into the film. It gets you thinking, which is always a good thing, who's going to die next and what you'd do in their situation. Although I'd say it was pretty predictable towards the end, this is still a film definitely worth every penny!I was very disappointed to hear that the bloody bits had been edited to reduce the rating (obviously for money purposes) as I am a blood and gore fan I have to say, but the story and acting indubitably makes up for this.I wouldn't have really thought this to have been a family film before I watched it, but it is one that the whole family will definitely enjoy!

Okay movie.,"I had nothing to do Thursday night. My friend called me and said lets go watch Hunger Game. I was like SO SO. Then i went to see it after much consideration. At midnight the theatre was half full. I took me by surprise because last time when i went to watch a movie on Sunday, there was not a single body there. But there was an environment so my expectation went high. After watching the movie. I had a so so feelings. Because, in the past there were many movies attempted that was based on survivor game, Just to name a few "" Condemned, Tournament"". So there was nothing special or new in the movie. The worst part of the movie is shaky camera just like ""found footage"" used in Cloverfield and Chronicle. It gave me a headache. But the best part of the movie is Acting and the conflict that may arise between the Trio in the future. The movie lacks development of character and dept. But overall, its a good movie worth watching once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the worst movies and adaptations ever?,"When my friends told me you should see Hunger Games,ı was excited. This must be one of the good movies of the year ı told myself. When looking for the film on IMDb,sow the rating 7.8,ı told myself this must be very good. Looking for the good films of the year,ı found Hunger games again. Finally ı had the ""chance"" to watch it. The result:one of the biggest disappointments ever. The plot sucks,acting sucks,everything in this movie sucks. It is a sci-fic thriller. But it doesn't fit that category too at all. Tigers rise up from the soil with computer buttons etc. Everybody in the capital lives well and they need to make a contest like this? Teens kill each other and this makes the capital happy ha.

Great story. Terrible camera work,"Warning: you'll get motion sick with this film. I love the screenwriting, the acting, the costumes, the special effects, the cast, and pretty much everything about it is well done. But OMG! Why are all the shots shaking?! I understand that the effect adds anxiety to the scenes and story. As someone who studied and worked in film and animation, I get it. But we don't need to do this with every shot. It also makes it cheap. It's easier to film and hide mistakes when the viewer can't see what's happening. The film didn't need this ""effect"" -it just gives you a headache.As I mentioned, the story is wonderful. It is heart wrenching and nauseating, but it makes you think about how real this could be in the world we already live in.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Solid, carried by Jennifer Lawrence","I have never read the Hunger Games books, and didn't rush out to see this first instalment when it was released. I have this thing where I sometimes resist a largely popular project simply because it's buzzing so much hype. There's a word for that that I resist even more, which starts with H, but good luck getting me to admit to that. Anywho, I did watch it one day on netflix, loved the hell out of it, and have seen every subsequent entry, up til last year's final one. It's damn great storytelling that soars on a brilliant extended performance by Jennifer Lawrence, who is the actress of her generation and a genius of the craft no matter what anyone says. People called this a slick version of Battle Royale, and while that may be true, it's certainly not a bad thing, and not the sole extent of what the franchise achieves. There's stinging social commentary which both condemns and makes satirical light of modern North American culture. It examines the power of propaganda for both good and bad ends. It looks at the abuse of power, and the potent rise of fascism and fear tactics, and how quickly they can become commonplace. And this is all in a young adult orientated film that stars a strong, unhindered female protagonist. Gives you hope for the world. Lawrence is powerful as Katniss Everdeen, a young woman chosen from her district to compete in the much celebrated and very violent Hunger Games, a death tournament which serves as a purge and reminder to the citizens what it cost them to rebel against their oppressors years before. This is all at the behest of mega villain President Snow (Donald Sutherland oozes quiet malice with every articulate and icy syllable), who lives in the wealthy and decadent capitol city of Panem, a dystopian version of North America. Along with Katniss there's also Peeta (but no hummus) a local baker's boy played by Josh Hutcherson, who really struggles to match the skill level of almost everyone around him, especially Lawrence. They are thrust into the posh and stylized razzle dazzle of Capitol life as they train for the ruthless games, watched over by previous Victor and proud alcoholic Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), as well as preening diva Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks channelling Marie Antoinette crossed with a poodle). The film takes some time to ramp up to the games, but as soon as it does the events unfold in breathless fashion set against a lush wilderness background, each and every member fighting tooth and nail to stay alive against both each other and the obstacles which games masters have placed in their way. Anyone with an intense fear of wasps will want to be warned. A clever riff on the talk shows of our climate is shown, as the competitors are quizzed by Ceasar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) a manically hopped up pop personality with a hairstyle that would make a samurai jealous and teeth so white they get accused of stealing Oscar nominations. Tucci is truly a well of energy and the proceedings go electric whenever he's around. Watch for Paula Malcolmson, Liam Hemsworth, Wes Bentley, Toby Jones and Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, a kindly fashion guru who takes a shine to Katniss and designs her a dress to end all dresses. Lawrence carries the entire thing on her mockingjay wings, making Katniss a spirit of unrest, a true symbol of hope and above all, a scared girl tossed into events she can't possibly imagine navigating. Her performance is most of what makes these films so solid, and they couldn't have made a better casting choice. Be sure to stay for the credits to hear 'Abraham's Daughter', a fittingly grandiose original song by Arcade Fire.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than the Trite material deserves.,"Let's admit it, this franchise got the green light based upon the teenage vampire movie craze. It is soooo convenient that the ages of our teenage warriors are exactly the same age range (12-18) as the target demographic for said teenage vampire fans. The setup on paper sounds pretty contrived: a set of males & females from 12 regions must fight to the death. As an older adult, I have skipped all those Twilight films, and never would find myself interested in this film. So why am I recommending it? Because the filmmakers were able make the story transcend the genre. This is not an easy task, and my guess it must have taken many rewrites to find themes and subtlety for a subject matter that belongs as a TV show on the CW network. Let's begin with the actual action scenes where you witness the brutal hunting down and killing of fellow human beings. You won't really find them in this film. In fact, the focus on weapons and people's skill using them is also a very minor feature in this film. Instead, the majority of the journey our protagonists go on is about relationships. Relationships with sister, Mother, boyfriend, state, country, mentors, sponsors, and rulers. We even get to learn about the relationship between the TV show producer and the country's dictator. Then there is the theme about how the oppressed are reduced to TV show idols, and are forced to perform to the whimsy of the viewing masses. The movie ""The Truman Show"" went this direction and mostly failed in it's attempt to humanise it. Somehow, ""The Hunger Games"" pulls it off. The wealthy class were deliberately cast with people with strange faces, and painted up like clowns to make them more like monsters than human.How does this film create believability? For one, the filmmakers completely immersed themselves in this alter-reality. Nothing is painted in broad strokes. Scenes of a poor community come to life through nice human moments, and keep the momentum going while making the best of exposition. Scenes requiring exposition in movies are very hard to make interesting. Again, credit goes to the screenwriters for approaching exposition in a creative way. Sometimes talking about the effect of an important plot point, leaving audiences briefly curious, then circling back and explaining why that effect happens. And how come this movie is 2 1/2 hours and doesn't contain much action? Because the filmmakers wisely avoided a cliché third act by avoiding predictability and keeping expectations fresh for the audience.My only real complaint is that the film did not need to be 2 1/2 hours, even though I bet many character subplots were cut out of the final version to make this running time. The second act drags somewhat while our competitors go through the rituals leading up to the actual game. This is the period where the players train and are evaluated, but once again little of this is actually shown. Instead we spend even more time on, yes, relationships. One of the greatest achievements in this film is the editing. Through the power of editing, a great deal of story is told in a short period of time. A friendship between two characters is established with some body language, instead of clunky dialogue. The music avoids bombastic action beats and instead evokes a folky ""human"" tone, something right in the comfort zone for composer James Newton Howard. The special effects are a minor part of the movie and don't really stand out when briefly seen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A good adaptation,"I personally enjoyed this one, both as a regular moviegoer and as a person who has read the book. In my opinion this is surprisingly faithful adaptation, which manages to capture the essence of the original story yet still managing to stand on its own. Is it helpful to have read the book before the movie? Yes, as with most adaptations, but the movie does a good job providing us the backstory and exposition. Not perfectly, mind you, but I don't think that many people will be confused by the plot.That being said, the best part of this movie are the actors. It is rather rare to see a movie starring young adult actors, who are as talented as this bunch. Jennifer Lawrence especially shined as the main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, managing to portray both her tough, survivalist attitude and her fear for her life. Easily the best performance in the film. Though I have to commend both Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth for their roles as Peeta Mellark and Gale Hawthorne, respectively.The movie isn't without flaws, unfortunately. The biggest problem is the shaky cam that every reviewer is sure to mention. Rationally I can realize that it was used to maintain the rating, but it was still a bit annoying from time to time, though one grew used to it after a while. The other problem that I had with this movie was that while it is a faithful adaptation and a good story in its own right, there was that final spark that was missing. It's a good movie, but not something that I will surely see again in the future.And that's this movie. It's good, but not great. Faithful to the source material and surely enjoyable to pretty much anyone, but not much more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
fine but not outstanding,"I would like to start by recommending this film, as it is good. however as many people have said its main flaw is its whole concept. To make this film available for its target audience every aspect of the film had to be toned down to allow it to slip in at a PG-13/12 rating. What this means is that the possibly great fighting scenes feel false and cheap. I have read the book when it came out and i would say that this film doesn't close. most of the aspects which made the books so good are lacking here.If you are a fan of the books I would still watch this film, it may not be the full package which you would hope it to be, but that is because it is aimed at you (being the under 15 year old) who may have ruined a possibly great film. Obviously it was a necessary step to make any sort of profit on the film but a regrettable one none the less",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
True to the novel and a great stand alone film,"Of course it has to be said that no book adaptation is ever as good on screen as the novel is on paper, but for the first time in my life I have not in any way been disappointed by the film. The story is well paced and progresses, even if a couple of the lesser facts and details in the book are skated over in the interests of time, but still for the most part covered. (Sorry that I'm being a little vague but I want to minimise spoilers as much as practicable). My greatest criticism is that the character of Rue seems a little bit rushed, and it's hard to emotionally engage with her, that being said it is still pretty well done. I am grading this quite harshly as I have read the book so can't be truly happy, but it is a very good adaptation and well worth going to see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"It was OK, but could have been a better adaptation.","I just came from a midnight screening, and as someone who very well understands the need to make changes from books to movies (a college professor of mine gave a class using PBS' ""American Short Story"" series where we read the story, the screenplay adaptation, watched the PBS TV movie -- and with living authors read THEIR take on the differences) -- I'm still a bit dissatisfied with some of the changes made from book to movie for ""The Hunger Games"" (and I just bought and read the book within the past week, so it's VERY FRESH in my mind).I bought and read ""The Help"" AFTER seeing the film, and while it, too, had differences, they sort of balanced out. I liked some changes in the movie better, some of the differences in the book better...It was pretty obvious, however, reading ""The Hunger Games,"" that even though it's not a very long novel, the exposition in it would require a 4-hour movie to have all the scenes from the book, so I KNEW they'd cut a lot of the superfluous scenes, and they did (and most of the stuff they cut was OK to cut). My biggest issue, perhaps, is the SHEER POLITICS of Hollywood ""Blockbuster-Making."" There was more brutality in the novel than they showed in the movie, and some of it I felt important to the story, but I'm certain what they cut was to get a PG-13 rating SO the movie would be available to a much wider audience and therefore SELL MORE TICKETS! That said, the changes they made in the FINAL FIGHT SCENE -- particularly with the ""wildlife"" -- were, to me INEXCUSABLE. Katniss' realization of what was going on there, and the sheer horror of just WHAT this ""Capitol"" can, and will do, was pivotal, to me. I would recommend you see the movie first, THEN read the book, and see what I mean.Flip side, they added A LOT of ""stuff"" in the movie that's NOT in the book -- mostly involving the president, played by Donald Sutherland... Of course a lot of the things he says may reflect things Katniss thought to herself in the novel. At any rate, I actually think what they did with him may have added to the impact of the story, a bit, but NOT at the expense of some of the other changes and a few deletions. I eagerly await (hopefully), an unrated ""Director's Cut"" of this movie that's 30 minutes or so longer and has more of what's missing.I might have rated this a bit higher if the final battle scene had been true to the book. Then again, there were some other things after that which weren't that I actually preferred. I'll leave it to folks who've read the book to see for themselves.I'd still recommend seeing this film to those who've read the novel. Just don't expect quite everything you may have hoped for. If you haven't read the novel, you'll probably LOVE IT. By itself, with no other context, it's a pretty great movie.Jeff Hayes",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hunger Games- worthwhile to watch?,"One game, one winner, one love, 23 deaths . The Hunger Games. This movie is an exciting, romantic and many-sided dystopia directed by Gary Ross. The story is based on the novel by Suzanne Collins. This irresistible and epic film portrays an alternative society by offering a dangerous contemporary development. In this newly-futuristic world there is on the one hand the rich Capitol, with advancements in technology, architecture and medicine, new colorful clothes and make up as well as plenty of food. On the other hand there are the oppressed districts -in total 12- , which are controlled by the Capitol and life in huge poverty. Every year, one boy and one girl, between the ages of 12 to 18, from each district are chosen by lottery to take part in the Hunger Games. There they have to kill the all other tributes, and the last survivor is the winner. The main character is the 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen played by the shining star Jennifer Lawrence. With her lovely, helpful, caring personality, her smartness and her beautiful appearance, she attracts the viewers' attention. This stunning movie is never boring, despite its length. If you want to have 142 minutes full of action and emotion you will have to watch this excellent film ""The Hunger Games""!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Didn't live up to the hype but still good,"When word was going around about ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy (being someone not familiar with the books), I thought I would give it a shot when it came out since Jennifer Lawrence was in it. Then came the insane Box-Office earnings and rave reviews from most parties. My expectations, as a result, were heightened. However, for me, the hype did not match it's reality. I am not saying that it wasn't a good film, it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be and I think it was so because it really did not put much detail into the many aspects which define the sociological order that exists in this dystopia. This is personified in an event which is based on the idea of a celebration dedicated to nothing other than constant revenge being undertaken by the powerful on it's powerless to serve as a reminder to the consequences of their actions.I know that most people (who have read the book) would not hold this critique into consideration coming from someone who has not read the prose. Most of the film's fans,however, are thoroughly satisfied due to it keeping true to the original material. To me a great adaptation does not necessarily need to replicate it's source but also give a perspective of the film-maker on it to be really considered to be a piece of art he/she can call their own. Even though the film is directed well by Gary Ross, the lack of that insight into the mechanisms that rule this dystopian futuristic world would have been appropriate and would have been a film which he could call his own. Probably the next installments will delve into that aspect a lot more to make it a better film than it is.Despite this flaw, I found the movie to be very enjoyable and would watch the sequel. Gary Ross (who, unfortunately, won't be back to direct the second installment) does tell the story he wants to tell very effectively with the use of Flashbacks and skillful editing despite the material lacking proper character development. A lot of people are saying that it lacks this insight into the characters due to it being the first of four films, but that for me is no reason why it could not be delved into since it has been done with such a series before.The star of the show was Jennifer Lawrence who continues to awe us all with her versatility and maturity on screen at such a young age. She really gives us a glimpse into what her character is all about and does it with a guile that is synonymous to the most seasoned actors. Unless, God forbid, some unforeseen tragedy befalls her, I think we are really witnessing the growth of a great actress for the future who will give us a career with performances to remember. Even though this performance is nothing compared to her brilliant breakout role as ""Ree"" in ""Winter's Bone"", it brings out her versatility as she plays the different facets of her character with admirable realism.A lot of people have been comparing this film to ""Battle Royale"" and I can't blame them. ""The Hunger Games"" even though it deals with very different schematics to that of the Japanese film, the portrayal of darkness in Takashi Miike's film was far more resounding giving it a more realistic perspective to society's degradation than ""The Hunger Games"" did. I am no sadist, but I think another flaw of ""The Hunger Games"" was that it really did not delve into the darkness and brutality which is the signature of such an event to a level which was required with such a premise. I guess if it was Directed with a darkness which is a signature for Director's in the East, it would have not been as accessible in theaters as it was, thus would have definitely deflated it's monstrous earnings (In hindsight, a wise business decision). Despite it's flaws (ones I consider to be), the film is really enjoyable and does have some very gripping scenes which complement it's material. Not a must-see, but I promise you would be entertained if you do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Far better than the book,"The Hunger Games is a surprise. For the first time I've watched a movie that is better than the original material. In a era that every channel has a new kind of reality TV program, like those ones that Truman Show (1998) and EdTV (1999) predicted a lot in a brief past, Suzanne Collins' idea sounds, by its own merits, interesting. And although her mix and parallels between reality shows and Roman Empire ""panem et circenses"" are by far the most interesting idea that came back to pop culture in the last couple years, I didn't like the book for a lot of reasons.The success of the book trilogy is completely understandable. Until 10 yrs back book series wasn't exactly a product of consumption until The Lord Of The Rings become more popular than it was. Then Harry Potter followed the success of its major source of inspiration, becoming the first young adult series to become a world wide hit. When the series was close to its end people was crazy for a new stuff, searching for a new book series that could replace it. Then Twilight saga was discovered and later, The Hunger Games.Unlikely Twilight saga, which entire movie series was made for young people that loved it without reasons because it is incredibly bad, this one is for a totally different audience. First of all because there is a real actress there, second because Gary Ross (director and writer) did a good work taking the essence of the book and amplifying it, never hiding from the audience that everything is a TV show, even the cheesy romance. But the good thing about Collins' saga is that it always was more interesting as a material to be used in the future than as literature. All three books of the brief saga are short, with a lack of description and poor narrative that would only satisfy those ones looking for a new subject. So, the best achievements of the screenwriters (including Collins herself) were taking all these flaws and transform them into a movie that does what the book fails: dive you into it.The 1st person narrative that Collins uses is an extremely old technique for those ones who does not succeeds a lot into other different perspectives, cutting a lot of what could be a great experience if a much more described narration was used instead. And that is what the movie does, it shows you the different and wider perspectives that the book does not.Gary Roos, who directed that sweet movie called Pleasentville (1998) and the great Seabiscuit (2003) had the same gentle hands here and the supporting actors give to the movie another high level. Elizabeth Banks performed Effie Trinket exactly as she is in the books. Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci (and his prosthetic teeth) were far better than the way Collins describe them.But at the same time that the movie feels better than the book, sometimes it also fails. It cuts some important facts of the book wasting time on Katniss hiding, crying and running or other uninteresting facts that if doesn't bore us, dumbs us. There are so much open space for close shots too, and also plenty of 1st person shots, which sometimes are interesting, connecting the audience to what the character is experiencing, but there is a time that it stops being interesting to become dull. For a movie rated PG 13, I think that more should have been shown like the fighting between other tributes which would have given us the feeling of what a true hunger game is. Instead, the tributes are shown as a bunch of teenagers in high school bullying each others.Its success is fair because it's not bad when compared to other low quality movies made for this age group. It has bad moments, but as a whole it deserves attention and Jennifer Lawrence deserves this success.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Running Man With Metaphors,"I'm a little late in seeing Hunger Games due to having somewhat of a life lately and not being able to catch up with the latest flicks. Hype got me in that seat and the fact that Jennifer Lawrence is pretty hot. I feared that this would be another Twilight but thankfully it's much better than that piece of garbage.Hunger Games follows a Running Man competition when two people from each district must hunt and kill each other for food for the districts. This is entertainment for the rich people, see, and us po' people must earn our way if we want to survive. Two things about this scenario strikes me: 1) This could happen because the Government and rich people are getting worse and 2) Someone during the development (possibly the author of the book) must have played too many online games because that's what this reminded me of. Not that I really invest much time in those but I'm just saying.Jennifer Lawrence does a fine job carrying this movie and the characters and plot devices keeps you from getting bored. However, there really wasn't much character development to get you fully invested to characters who contribute to important scenes. There's a scene where Jennifer Lawrence was crying over a character and I really didn't feel much emotion, mainly because this character she was crying for never had the time to develop. Another thing that bugs me and I hear it's in the book is the costumes. They were just so outlandish and weird for my tastes. I was never really big on future movies anyway so I digress. I love the sets, though.But Hunger Games was a really good movie and I'll catch the sequel earlier when it comes out. Hopefully I'm not busy then.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"As far as teen oriented films go, this was pretty solid.","First of all, I loved Jennifer Lawrence in this; this girl can really act and is definitely going to be a good actress. The best moments of the film pretty much all involved her and she takes this from just an OK film to something pretty good (although it was a slightly sub par performance compared than her in Winters Bone, but that's probably to do with the script). I'm definitely a fan of hers.The film was fairly unique, and much better than the usual teen fair. The concept kept you interested and things definitely got a bit dark, more so than normal in a run of the mill kids film. Surprisingly, the pacing of the film was excellent, as it never really felt like 2.5 hours long, at all. I've always found that to be a good trait of a great film.I wasn't really moved by the ""big emotional scene"", because I never really cared for any of the characters outside of Katniss. There wasn't enough character development for me to feel connected to them. A bit surprising given the almost 2.5 hour run time, you figured there'd be enough time for more character development. Admittedly, it did seem to work for some of the younger kids in the audience (who probably read the book and had the background I lacked). However, the scene directly after this did hit home (for me anyway), as it really underscored the bleakness of the films sci-fi future.The hype machine on this was clearly in over drive. I enjoyed it, but it's definitely not as good as it's been touted. It was fairly predictable as the ending was never really in doubt and there were few scenes that really blew me away. Still, definitely worth watching though.http://andretms.blogspot.ca@the_movie_snob",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Teenagers fight to the death in order to affirm the government's power. There's a social commentary in there somewhere.,"THE HUNGER GAMES is the first movie that I saw on opening day at the midnight showing. By midnight, I was thinking that I had made a very serious mistake. I was beginning to feel unusually aged; I had just spent two hours sitting in a movie theater as scores of teenagers flitted by giggling, texting and composing songs. When I saw how many of them were sporting hand-painted t-shirts emblazoned with ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"", I started wondering if I should develop a taste for tapioca and begin amassing an obnoxious number of cats. ""Do NOT do this to me,"" I thought with a burning and selfish anger. ""Do NOT turn this into TWILIGHT.""I need not have worried. From the opening, THE HUNGER GAMES pulled me in and immersed me in Suzanne Collins' dystopian world. Sure, I really enjoyed the book, but it does not necessarily follow that I'll enjoy the movie. This time, I did. Certainly, there are some things I would have liked to see done differently, but overall, I was impressed. No, not this-is-going-to-go-down-in-the-annals-of-classic-cinema impressed, but I felt as though the purchase of my ticket was money well-spent.The movie stays very true to the story: Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) becomes her district's first volunteer for the government-powered, homicidal powerfest in the guise of a reality show known as the Hunger Games. When Katniss' younger sister Prim (Willow Shields) is randomly selected to compete in the games, Katniss rushes forward to offer herself in Prim's place as tribute. Katniss is then swept off to the Capitol with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) as the other tribute where they must put on a show for the glory and power of the Capitol as they fight to the death against 22 other youngsters.There is a great deal of bloodshed in THE HUNGER GAMES, but it furthers the movie's plot and does not feel as though the film team is just gratuitously spraying red paint across the screen. In fact, I had the distinct sense that those responsible for the production were toning down the movie's potential sanguinity. I had wondered how they were going to handle the infamous bloodbath at the Cornucopia, and I will say that I am impressed with how they depict such a raw and brutal scene. The use of the camera to give a distorted sense of time and vision does a wonderful job of underscoring the horror of what is occurring while not permitting the blood-letting to overpower the underlying message. At no point does the movie give the sense that it relishes the blood and the body count.I am also impressed with the actors' performances. Lawrence's Katniss is appropriately strong with undercurrents of emotion while not delving into distracting waves of angst. Woody Harrelson does a fine job of portraying Haymitch as simultaneously humorous, sympathetic and haunted. I have to give some major props to Hutcherson for his portrayal of Peeta. Reading the book, I was lukewarm on Peeta- I didn't hate him, but I didn't care one whit what happened to him. Hutcherson's performance changed that. He presents Peeta as a complex and engaging person, really giving dimensions to a character I had felt was rather flat.I do wonder, though, who signed off on the shaky-cam. Seriously. I see what you're doing there, but please stop. The jitteriness of the picture grows tedious quickly. I am not a film student, but I am under the impression that the shaky-cam ought to be used sparingly. If so, I now know why. And of course, I wish more time could have been spent on the other tributes, particularly Rue (Amandla Stenberg). Rue's relationship with Katniss becomes the catalyst for so many things on a grand scale, and it really deserves more time. Certainly, the scene in District 11 brought goosebumps to my arms, but I had also read the book.That brings me to my next point: I would recommend reading the book first. The movie cannot possibly include all of the nuances, all of the character development, all of the implications of what is occurring. However, without understanding the depths of Collins' world, it can be difficult to fully appreciate the movie. For me, reading the book meant the difference between ""well, this is an entertaining movie"" and ""wow, I would definitely see that again"" (which I did, just in case anybody cared to know).In the end, THE HUNGER GAMES is a very engaging, very satisfying movie and definitely is worth a watch.

Shaky Camera Effect was Too Much,"I could have done without the shaky camera effect.Maybe the director thought the audience would think this was a real documentary?The shaky camera was so excessive I can only assume it was to cover poor choreography or save money on scenery, but really it was probably just poor directing.Other than giving me a shaky cam headache, the movie was great.The movie was fairly loyal to the book and the changes made were understandable. The casting was well done and I am looking forward to the next movie (hopefully with a steady cam this time.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hunger Games,"Based on the popular novels by Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games sets reality TV on high by forcing teens into a 24 person battle royale, a legitimate fight to the death where the lone victor will be showered with honors for the district they call home. The government forces children into these ferocious games as penance for society uprising; to keep people in their place they sacrifice two teens from every district, parading them around to gain popularity for a world wide audience. The Hunger Games fashions style and tenacity from its vibrant cinematography, creating a futuristic dystopia where upper society strives on extravagant hair-styles and gaga esque outfits, while the lower classes wallow in 19th century living styles. Millions tune in nationally to see these teens beat each others brains out and take bets on who will become the victor. Much of the build-up revolves around how these contestants sell themselves to gain sponsors who essentially will ensure their survival, the pay-off is immense. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen shines, and adds a depth to her character that others may have lacked. The fear on her face as she enters the battle royale is real. Up to that point it's been a parade, showing off to gain acclaim, but the fun and games are over and what is about take place is life or death.The source material for The Hunger Games I'm certain is far more in- depth, and that is somewhat missed within the film. Just when we think we're going to get to know some of these characters they die, or worse yet a flashy explosion detracts from the narrative, but still The Hunger Games delivers in entertainment value, keeping you guessing who will survive and how Katniss will escape her perilous enemies within the battle yet again. Her prowess and survival skills make her a tough cookie, we learn that early on, so were not surprised when her rough exterior makes her a formidable opponent. While she's interesting to say the least, it's her counter-parts who are somewhat lacking; we barely get to know many of them before they're sent off to the slaughter for our viewing pleasure. Amandla Stenberg as the young girl Rue is also noteworthy, shedding humanity onto a film which desperately needs it. Her expressions go beyond her years as a young actress and she adds a delight to the film. Woody Harelson also has a nice supporting role, playing a drunken-tutor who seemingly has written the book on how best to survive.The Hunger Games while having a wonderful entertainment value fails to go the extra mile to ensure greatness (the ending lacks somewhat; without question they're leaving room for sequels). If anything, the only gripe anyone can have is simply wanting more out of it. Much like a helpless society, we watch people we hardly know slaughter each other, and young adults at that, we are emotionally startled at first but as things progress we become more desensitized until all we want is more brutality. The Hunger Games delivers in this regard, forcing a love angle that may or may not develop in the films to come, and creating a sense of alarm within each of us as we imagine how we would react in a similar scenario. Odds are we would do what was necessary to survive, odds are we would also have the moral fiber to question the games themselves. The Hunger Games works however. Just like the audience watching within the film, you'll have a hard time turning away.Stephen Febick, 4/2/2012",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Well executed futuristic dystopia tale, albeit an unlikely scenario","Like any blockbuster movie with a futuristic dystopia theme, this one will have its hard core fans as well as equally passionate detractors. The one thing you can count on from any movie of this ilk worth its salt is that there'll be plenty of discussion--both on the positive side regarding its imagination and vision, while being vulnerable to ridicule about where it's over the top and unrealistic.The vision is impeccable: a brutal government rules with unilateral control over a meek, broken, and battered proletariat. This was the result of a failed rebellion 70 years or so earlier, to the misfortune of the contemporary citizens. The government insulated their future control by rendering the rebels to little more than submissive, powerless slave colonies. Their ultimate symbol of their unquestioned authority was to force each of the 12 colonies to send two young people, through lottery, into a free-for-all challenge to the death. Only the last standing fighter would be allowed to live, in this apparent reference to ancient Roman Gladiators. Not an exact parallel, however; this challenge makes the Romans pale by comparison: it pits children/teens against one another, and no quarter is ever given. Kill or be killed is the only rule.The story depicts the central government as something akin to the self- indulging phonies that Alice met in Wonderland. Fashion styles that would make the 80's punkers blush or laugh; hair styles that were even sillier. The inevitable mockery and finger pointing of modern society is not left out, usually expressed in the forms of technology, weaponry, communication, and social behavior. The arena-style presentation over television for a population of passionate spectators is a prime example of this. If taken at face value, the artistic point is clearly made through these exaggerations. The absurd styles seem unlikely (we're moving away from that, not towards it right now), but watching violence for vicarious pleasure is indeed already evolving in ever weirder and more dangerous reality show competitions.The action of the film is appropriately brisk, and also masterfully tempered. Bloodbath scenes are measured by often being implied rather than brazenly shown for the sake of gore. This balances the intellectual moral of its dystopia message, with just enough violence to support why such a future is negative in the first place. Still, even though the movie successfully avoids overdoing the violence, the plot's idea of children killing children should give you pause before taking your entire family to see this.The acting, by a mostly unknown cast, is exceptional, at least for the actors with a character that is developed enough to give them a chance to stand out. The settings and backdrop decor are impressive, and the flow of the story is spot on. The story is told well, the characters are interesting, and the world that is imagined leaves an imprint after leaving the theater. There are minor faults in the execution, but this is overall, a worth while film to see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Peeta (and Cast) Satisfy Fans' Hunger,"The odds were definitely in the favors of the movie creators of the Hunger Games. Making 155 million dollars opening weekend, the Hungers Games exceeded fan's expectations. The film's accuracy to the book's text, written by Suzanne Collins, pleased the massive numbers of dedicated fans. The talented Jennifer Lawrence plays the main character Katniss Everdeen, a young girl who lived in District 12, the poorest of all districts, with her sister, mom, and best friend Gale Hawthorne, played by Liam Hemsworth. Lawrence made an outstanding performance which perfectly displayed Katniss' traits of bravery, stubbornness, and survivalist instincts. The story takes place in Panem, a post- apocalyptic country located on the continent of North America. The Capitol, an extravagant and lavish city which dictates the country, hosts an annual game show called ""The Hunger Games"" in which tributes are picked from each district to battle until death in the man-made and controlled arena. Katniss and Peeta Mallark, played by Josh Hutcherson, are selected from District 12 to participate in the games and must try to survive the cruel Capitol imposition that traditionally kills twenty- three people, leaving only one victor. One can assume that a plot set in a futuristic Utopian world has to be intriguing, but somewhat difficult to produce. The movie realistically portrays Panem through the intricate set details of the arena and Capitol. Many were excited to see how the game arena would be portrayed since the book described it as a force-field covered area, strictly controlled by the Gamemakers, with a Cornucopia center. The Cornucopia was where the games began and contained necessary weapons and tools. This part was disappointing because, in the movie, the Cornucopia was just a large, metal, box-looking structure. Aside from that, the set was extremely well done. Furthermore, the graphics of the fighting scenes did not fail to impress audiences. From Katniss' bow and arrow shootings to the chase of the mutated wolves, watchers were completely soaked into the movie absorbing the intense action-packed scenes. However, the film was comical at certain parts, mostly due to Katniss' sometimes awkward personality. The make-up of the cast members was also astonishing. It was elaborate and creative, but not overdone and frightening. Exemplary examples include Seneca Crane's beard and Cinna's eyeliner. Overall, the movie was marvelous and I applaud the cast for an outstanding job imitating an accent that has not yet been heard.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Everyone loves a good underdog.""","Every now and then, there comes a sci-fi film that pushes the boundaries of what is considered civil, for even though civilization may prosper, there will always be a demand for violent entertainment. Films that portray futuristic death-matches for sport could probably be counted only in the double-digits; titles like the original ""Rollerball,"" ""The Running Man,"" ""Battle Royale,"" and the ""Death Race"" remake typically dominate this obscure corner of sci-fi.In this niche, ""The Hunger Games"" might be the most accessible film ever. It doesn't indulge on gory, graphic details the way these other films do; most deaths in this death-match are off-screen, obscured, or just plain bloodless. There's still enough roughness to emphasize the harrowing nature of the actual Hunger Games; some might even say it's better that way.It takes a good hour or so to get to the games; the film runs a good long length and takes its time to establish the story, characters, the environment, and the conflict, before getting down and dirty with everything else. The film entertains throughout; very few, if any scenes, dragged. I personally found myself well-invested in the story.And the story will be the thing worth seeing. Those familiar with Suzanne Collins' book will probably relate to the film best, as they can pick out all the fine details and understand every nuance the best. The film does a first-rate job of adapting the original story; there are many minor changes, but most of it is just like the book. Those unfamiliar with the book may be alienated from the film, though most of it can stand on its own. Characters stand out pretty well; a romance does come about that seems reminiscent of ""Twilight,"" which will attract young audiences (especially the ladies) and could be off-putting for dudes wanting straightforward fighting. Regardless, the film never comes off as sappy or pandering.My biggest complaint is in the filming; it looks great half of the time, but harsh, shaky, jittery cameramanship rears its ugly head throughout. There are three or four times where I wish I could have seen more of what was going on, but couldn't because of the photography. Otherwise, parts of the film look great and stylish, and have fine editing. I was pleased with the acting and writing; everybody puts on a quality performance. This production has some very fascinating sets, props, and costumes. For special effects, I've seen better and I've seen worse. Music is pretty nice.I'd recommend this best to fans of the book, and interested sci-fi fans. Those seeking more hardcore material can do better.4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4.5/5, film: 4/5)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Das Kapital / Communist Manifesto as a teen action movie,"Let's get the praise out of the way first:* Memorable characters* Kick-ass female hero* Solid actor performances* Stunning, credible visuals* Thrills, excitement and tear-jerker moments aplenty...but this high concept literally had me rolling my eyes within the very first minute of exposition.What's the premise of this movie? Well it's simple: The Rich are bastards. The Rich ignore The Poor just so the former may live their lives in lavish excess and plenty while everyone else starves. The Rich are totally oblivious of the sufferings of The Poor and are more easily distracted from real world problems than a pixie in a jewelry sto... ooooh, shiny!! Not only that but the beauty standards of The Rich are just sickening; they think they are pretty... but we all know they look like clowns.Then there are the People In Power. The People In Power are not just bastards, they are pure evil. They exploit The Poor to maintain the lifestyle of The Rich and will do absolutely anything to maintain the status quo, murder included. And they don't even do it themselves but make The Poor kill each other. Why? Because The People In Power exercise shameless victim blaming, so according to the ""logic"" of the Hunger Games - as explained by the People In Power - The Poor earned their plight. This evil is so institutionalized that the power to screw with The Poor even comes with a nifty Copy & Paste interface, used with smirking glee several times during the narrative.And this has been going on for no less than Seventy. Four. Years. Only if you read the books before you see the movie can you understand why this is happening.Enter The Heroic Underdog that is pure in heart, self-sacrificing, skilled, defiant and - most important of all - beautiful. She plays the game(s) of the People In Power, excels at them without actually getting her hands dirty and soon there is unrest among the oppressed masses that are The Poor. Do I need to mention that that People In Power explicitly hate pure, self-sacrificing, skilled, defiant and beautiful Heroic Underdogs that cause unrest and threaten to overthrow the system?The story is the theories of Karl Marx, heavily condensed to their simplest, most romanticized form. The disguise is paper thin: it is upper class vs. worker class as per The Communist Manifesto & Das Kapital For Teens In The 2010's. The workers are fed up getting used and abused, but are constantly quelled by the upper class. Enter the worker class hero that is the spark to the upcoming revolution...The rest is just some tastefully hidden violence to pad it out as a two hours teen action flick and drive home the point that the upper class really is The Evulz (as my teenage daughter would express it).Who should see this film? If you like stories of the ""system is corrupt and needs overthrowing""-genre... go for it. If you want to see rich, arrogant, gloating jerks get their comeuppance... this is just up your alley. If you want a movie with refreshingly strong female characters that your daughters and sons can watch without you worrying about stale gender roles... yes, this is it!Just don't think too much about the insane, over-the-top premise or you get an otherwise decent film ruined for you. I couldn't avoid that. But that's just because I'm getting too old for this flick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Battle scenes are sparse bur dramatic and not overdone like the fighting scenes in the recent movies like ""Game of Shadows"" where everybody seems to know some martial art. In reality fights are short and people die easily and that is how they are shown on the screen. Main character arouses sympathy and is someone who we can root for. Jennifer Lawrence looks gorgeous in every scene reminding of Diana, goddess of the Hunt. Some reviewers criticize the movie for its lack of gore claiming it is boring but that is far from true.

A bit long,"This film tells the story of a young woman who is forced to enter a death match that only one will live out of 24 contestants.While many people compare this film with the book is based on, I'll compare it with the Japanese film ""Battle Royale"" which has a similar storyline. ""Battle Royale"" is bloodier and more brutal, and it doesn't beat around the bush. This film, on the other hand, concentrates on plot development before the actual game begins. I was getting a bit impatient for the game to begin, and for people to really fight with each other. ""The Hunger Games"" still show the struggle for social, cooperation and altruism like ""Battle Royale"" does, but on a smaller scale. Jennifer Lawrence is very convincing as a brave young woman fighting for survival. I was amazed by her in ""Winter's Bone"", and this time she amazes me again.The plot is tight but not eventful enough to fill up the 2.5 hour screen time.

Good Adaptation of the world but....,"The Hunger Games is one of my favorite novel that has came out in the past 5 years. As I am writing this review now I am on Part 2 of Catching Fire so I can't say that its my favorite trilogy in the past 5 years. The actual story is compelling, yet not original but it's still satisfying either way. So lets get started!After I saw the trailer which I think was an excellent trailer because of the fact that it didn't show any of the games, just the build up to them. By watching the trailer I felt as though they were going to follow the book very closely, considering that Suzanne Collins helped write the screenplay for the movie. So I was really excited that we are actually gonna see this world come to life and get to see the story unfold and see how another person would put together this world from what they thought it would look like.Gary Ross who directed the film did succeed in making the world and the characters come to life. From the rundown and poor life style of District 12 to the crazy, colorful, and futuristic style of the Capitol, he nailed it spot on. Its not only the places that came to life, but also the characters.The acting in this movie is extremely good. Jennifer Lawrence is the only person I can see in this role. She had already proved herself in Winters Bone, and once again she proves herself here. She makes Katniss come to life and plays her flawlessly. Josh Hutcherson I think did a fine job, even though I'm not a big fan of him at all. Woody Harlenson and Elizabeth Banks both did a really good job themselves in their roles. Donald Sutherland is up there with Lawrence in his role. He makes you hate President Snow as soon as he shows up on screen, fantastic job. Stanley Tucci also is amusing and does a good job.In the movie I like how they give you a feeling that they keep reminding you that you are watching a gameshow. By using the announcers tell the audience certain things that Katniss tells you in the book, the announcers do in the movie. I thought that was a great and creative idea. I also like how they show to people that haven't read the books, the gamemakers control room. Once again a creative way to help move the plot points.Now yes this movie does a good job adapting the source material, but it doesn't do a good job in exacuting them. By that I mean the biggest flaw of the film was character development.The character development I feel is unacceptable in every way. Now the movie is 2 hours and 20 mins its already pretty long. In that time span they decide to cram every detail of the story, or I should say ""big set pieces"" of the book in there. Which is fine but not fine if a character dies who we should care about, but completely don't due to the fact that both those characters had 5mins of screen time together, and what feels like an hour time of day for the characters in the film but is really a few days in the book.Personally I felt the movie seemed short due to the cramming of all the key points of the book in there, so I think the movie would have benefited with 10 more mins of character develop in there. Some might argue that the film would have been way too long and boring, but if it helps me connect with the characters I'm all for it.The Hunger Games does a fine job adapting the novel and making the universe come to life, I just wished I actually felt more emotion towards the characters and actually cared what happened to them.This one is really hard for me because I like the story of the book so much that I felt cheated on the saddest part of the book, next to the ending which they left out and I was disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An unbiased review,"In a few words: Surprised and Great. I am writing this review because I believe this film should be judged BY THE FILM and not by the book. I did not read the book so I believe that my review will be fair. So, without further a do...Overall I was very happy with the film. I did have my doubts going in, whether it was from reading others reviews or seeing what my friends wrote, but at the end of the movie I can honestly say it was a very good film.Here were some of the things I did like: For a movie that was over 2 hours long it certainly did not feel like over 2 hours. The movie kept my attention very well. There were many times where I was incredibly anxious because I had to know what happened next. I thought the leading roles were well chosen with none of the characters seeming fake. Normally I do not pay much attention to costumes and scenery but it was hard not to in this film. They were excellent and very well thought up. To end the positives, I would like to add that the whole movie flowed together very nicely.Some things I did not like: Shaky camera. Sometimes it is Okay to have a shaky camera (i.e. Bourne movies) but at times in this film I felt it very unnecessary. I found this annoying especially in the beginning but towards the end it got much better. I think as time went on it seemed more appropriate, but when we are trying to get to know the characters in the film I would advise against it. Another part that bothered me, but only somewhat, was the ending. I felt it ended very abruptly. Although the closing scene left me wanting more I know that they could have brought the film more to a close while still leaving me wanting more.Overall I was very happy with the film. Again, I did not read the books nor talk to people who had read them. I wanted to be surprised by the contents of the film and at the end of the day I very much was.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
grim but absorbing,"I was hesitant to watch this movie because the premise - children being forced to compete to the death - seemed so unpleasant. It is unpleasant, and grim, but it's also fast moving and kept me interested throughout.Ultimately, though, I feel this movie didn't quite commit to anything. It's an action movie with some pretty good action scenes, but the dour concept keeps it from being a fun popcorn-style action movie. At the same time, the movie didn't really embrace the moral darkness of the tale; the lead character is put in a situation where there would seem to be no possibility of not doing monstrous things, but then she manages to go through the whole movie being flawlessly pure and noble, with any problematic moral choices neatly swept out of her way.It's a good movie, and I enjoyed it, for the most part, but honestly I feel I would have been better served to have followed my instincts and skipped it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Pleasantly surprised!,"I'm not one to jump on the bandwagon, so when all the hype about the Hunger Games books and movies came about, I wasn't eager to delve into it. It took me 2 years since the release of the first movie to actually watch it - and I was pleasantly surprised. (Keep in mind, I haven't read the books, but I did have a general understanding of it.)I can't comment on the accuracy of the movie-book adaptation, but as someone that hasn't read the books - yes there were a few question marks going through my mind at some points - but overall, I felt that the movie conveyed the subject matter effectively and was easy to understand. I got the general sense of the movie - and I knew there were questions to be answered, but I also knew that there would be sequels to the first that might answer my questions. The acting was superb, costume and makeup absolutely stunning (the portrayal of people in the Capitol had always intrigued me) - and I saw some comments about the shaky camera...I watched this on a small screen, so it didn't affect my viewing experience. I think it was appropriate for conveying a sense of urgency in this movie and showing Katniss' perspective while not detracting too much from the movie itself.I found myself really wanting to read the books and reading up on the Hunger Games universe to know more about the world itself.

Evasive but engaging adaptation,"I suddenly found myself reading The Hunger Games trilogy in preparation for the movie, mainly due to the allure of Jennifer Lawrence. Thankfully, it was a pretty fun read, even though the books are fairly derivative, at least in regard to their dystopian theme. It's the ambivalence of Katniss that drives the story forward and keeps it interesting, so to my mind this was one of the most important things to get right in the movie.The universe of Panem, a land set in the future comprised of twelve districts and run by an authoritarian capitol, may seem a bit implausible in its literary portrayal, but the movie gets the tone and scope of the place just right. District Twelve is the home of our main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, a teenager charged with the responsibility of taking care of her mother and sister after the passing of her father in a mining accident. As if life weren't difficult enough on a day to day basis, every year the Capitol organizes ""The Hunger Games"", a duel to the death in which two tributes, a boy and a girl, are enlisted from each district to battle for survival. The event is supposed to serve as a reminder and punishment of the failed rebellion against the capital which took place 74 years prior. In an unfortunate turn of the odds, Katniss is forced to volunteer for her younger sister once she is selected for participation in the games, and together with Peeta Mellark, the male tribute of District Twelve, she heads off into the unknown and, most likely, towards her demise.The key to understanding the event itself is that it represents a piece of entertainment, similar to the gladiator fights of Ancient Rome. As the participants are groomed for a televised show, the macabre concept behind the games may be easy to lose out of sight, and it is at this point that the direction of the film becomes a bit skewed and decides to evade/underplay one of the central plot lines in the book. In the transition from Katniss' literary narrative to the cinematic transposition, her struggle with herself and those around her, in particular Peeta, loses out. As the two tributes, under the guidance of their mentor, decide to play out a love story in order to endear themselves to the public, the film's focus shifts to the more easily translatable tension resulting from the potential love triangle between Peeta, Katniss and her childhood friend Gale (who remained in District Twelve), rather than focusing on the constant ambivalence in Katniss' soul. This is particularly interesting once it becomes evident that Peeta has truly been in love with her for many years, while the question of her own feelings towards him are shrouded behind the importance of self-preservation.Therefore, it is a shame that the film's choice is to portray the situation as a love triangle, set to develop further in the upcoming sequels, rather than to investigate the implication of how Katniss feels at odds with her situation and the role she has to play, knowing that in the end there is only one survivor to The Hunger Games. It is understandable that due to the scope of the movie franchise this would be a bit harder to sell, but it undermines one of the most fascinating themes of the book, the journey of Katniss' self-discovery.Implicitly, we get a fairly limited understanding of most characters and how they relate to one another. Despite this hindrance, Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, who play Katniss and Peeta, manage to infuse a lot of what their characters are supposed to be into the final print of the movie, thereby conveying at least part of what is unwritten in the script and transpires from the books. Hopefully, the undertones of their relationship will be further expanded upon in the second movie, without focusing too much on the romantic dilemma, which serves as a backdrop in the books, rather than a driving force.Also, what the movie managed to do quite well is create a fine rapport between President Snow, played with delightful and menacing restraint by Donald Sutherland, and the game-maker Seneca Crane. Their scenes shed some insight into the workings of the games which otherwise could have needed a rather tiresome narrative, while still defining two characters of interesting depth.I can imagine some of the shortcomings mentioned are less evident to viewers who have not read the whole story, which leaves them with a pretty well rounded film about a cruel world that begs for many answers - but lacks a fair bit of heart. Seeing how difficult it is to rise up to the expectations of so many interested parties when producing a film like The Hunger Games, it is fair to say that the end result is a reasonably faithful and sensible adaptation of an engaging story. The politics behind Panem, which should feature more extensively in the second movie, will be a different challenge altogether, but the set-up for the sequel is solid and should offer a large enough scope to fulfill the vision of Suzanne Collins and her rather uncompromising characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
bad movie,"the hunger games was so slow i almost fell asleep, was not like the original one no real action i will not waste my money on the next one God forbid if there is one, the acting was not very good the ending was bad, i thought there was more to the movie, did not like the Mockingbird actor being weak at time i would like to have seen here Stronger as a Woman fighter she seemed to weak and just playing the part, the special effects were good that kept me interested but there was not very much of it, and it could of use more of it, too much talk and slow dialog to make it interesting i wanted to scream to the screen Do Something everybody wanted to console someone and no one wanted to fight",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good film!,I didn't really know anything about the Hunger Games before seeing it at the movies.For others like me The Hunger Games is a fight to the death between representatives from the 12 districts in a future world. There are 2 contestants selected from each district and the winner is the last survivor. The story follows District 12's participant Katniss who volunteers to replace her sister Prim.The film is interesting and engaging throughout and there's a definite influence from the Truman Show and Lord of the Flies amongst others. It certainly also leaves you with plenty to talk and think about afterwards. I found out that it was based on books and I enjoyed the film enough to make me go out and buy the trilogy. Hopefully the books will be as entertaining as the film!,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Severely raises the bar for film adaptations of young adult novels, to a level of action that is accessible and appealing to all age groups.","Every location in the setting is different from one another, visceral to take in, and stylishly inspired. It's difficult to add polished production to a post-apocalyptic scenario and still be taken seriously, and The Hunger Games does this so masterfully, it's especially impressive by movie adaptations of young adult novels standards. It doesn't feel the need to constantly remind you visually that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world, avoiding bland color schemes by utilizing its moody vibe and lighting which the production brings to life, and relies on its characters and well-crafted story telling to remind you of what the inhabitants of the world have brought upon it, with a intelligently powerful observational message that unfortunately rings too true a bell, on how we as a race continue to do so even after the world fell apart. It leaves a diversely organic yet grimy impression on a scale of varying atmospheres, without drowning itself in darkness, and has the balls to not let up on the violence and action even though the subject actors are teenagers, as is the target audience. Making it an example for poor adaptations of young adult novels with clichéd adolescent personalities and stereotyped casting to follow. This finds middle ground in thrilling appeal, and doesn't go too soft or too hard in either respect, making it very accessible without coming across as restrained or watered down. Its engaging, exciting, and remarkably respectable when considering the quality deprived reputation of its demographic of origin.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
exciting adventure....,"but the movie should have been rated R to tell the story better. By this I mean, it is about teens brutally killing each other to win a contest; the violence sounds like an R rating to me. It would have been better if the kills were actually shown and more gore and blood to show the horror of it. Instead, it was really toned down to get a pg13 rating.The beginning was a little slow, like others have said, the game was the focus of the film and doesn't start to over an hour in. Some things that didn't make sense was how could they conger up fire and dogs that were real in the game, made no sense. If you could do that, why not wipe out all the people in the lesser districts so you don't have to worry about keeping them under control. I liked Woody Harrelson's character, he knew how to play all the power people perfectly. Did any of the other kids get help from their mentor? It was never shown.FINAL VERDICT: Fun, adventure film. I haven't read the books, but I bet quite a bit got left out because there wasn't room to put it in the movie. The only negative is it is set up for a sequel, and it will be many months before it's released.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perfect support for the book!,"There are two groups of people that will watch this movie. Those that have read the book first and those that haven't.

Panem et circenses,"Overdone reality. Every year TV shows are becoming crueler, fashion is becoming more freakish, social contradictions are aggravated more. Susan Collins' world is an amazing combination of the fiction about future, legends of the past and realities of the present. The story about young Katniss Everdeen touched deeply many people around the world and of course big hopes were pinned on the screen version.I read The Hunger Games in 2010 and it was my favorite book. So I was waiting impatiently for watching this film for two years. And when I watched it, it didn't look like I'd imagined.The script. Well, it's hard work to rewrite not very big but rich in events book in a two-hour film. But I can't tell that they did it well. However, I rate it as higher-than-expected. I thought scriptwriters would cut much more scenes but they only deleted some episodic characters and focused us on really important moments.But whether were they able to show the story?Born from the ashes a post apocalyptic state Panem with the shining Capitol and enslaved twelve Districts. Hunger, poverty, silence as only available act of the volition. In the spotlight the girl who was going to die for saving her little sister and the boy who was falling in love with heroine and who had saved her once. Die was cast and they both went to the grand capitol for making a show for its perverse residents and dying on the Arena for their entertainment. «The Hunger Games» – the story without semitones. This was the first spark; the Girl on Fire kindled it in people's hearts. And this was the thing which was missed – the fire. Despite of persistent book following they lost the point with chasing the details. No contrast, no fear, many questions and no sense. The world was gray and didn't aroused any emotions.Cast. Nobody looked hungry. At all. But OK, you can say that it's not important how they looked like but how they acted. Well, if glared eyes and frozen faces with open mouths were the best that Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson were able to show - it's disappointing. Maybe J.L. had a couple of good scenes but that's all. Now she is very famous and she's one of the best young actresses, she really can play brilliant. However, in this film she was awful. The only character in all film who was really great was Haymitch Abernathy. Woody Harrelson was the only actor who tried to play at least.Cinematography. What was doing on? Was the camera tied on the rope or was cinematographer drunk so his hands was shaking overtime? I had a headache, it was terrible!Music. This was the thing which saved the film. There were no needless songs, no pompous tirades. Music sounded naturally and moving where it should be. It made the film atmosphere and it was magnificent.Well, the odds were in the film favor because of many fans all around the world and because of simple pattern of the story that teenagers like - there were defiance to the system, love story and the choice. But there wasn't anything new or anything significant. It's so wailful, when a good book becomes a popular film because then it often loses its heart.I think the film was quite well but nothing else.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Film,"The box office didn't lie for this movie. I saw this movie on its opening weekend, it was a great film, that had it all. It has a phenomenal depiction of Suzanne Collins' futuristic world that is post war. I would suggest this movie to anyone that hasn't seen it.The relationship between the book and the movie is actually pretty similar. If you have read the books and liked them (like most movies based off novels) you will love the movie for sure.Lastly Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job as the lead.

"Hunger Games, the movie","This movie is science fiction set in a distant future in which part of North America is divided into 12 zones, with some zones wealthier and more advanced than others. Television still plays a huge role in this future society. Television producers are able to create elaborate fantasy worlds.For historical reasons, each zone is required to select a young man and young woman to participate in a reality show that is essentially a mutual hunt to the death combined with an escape from deadly special effects. The story focuses on the experiences of one engaging and attractive young couple from a particularly poor district.This interesting future world and the grand theatricality and drama of the ""hunger games"" are gradually revealed in a way that allowed me to get caught up in it. I enjoyed seeing how they imagined the future would look and how such a show would be mounted. The characters were extraordinarily attractive and the movie was visually appealing. The movie was fast paced and I was curious to see where it would lead.The character development of the Katniss character was good and the role was believably and well played by Jennifer Lawrence. She was the focal point of the movie (perhaps at the expense of the other characters). I ending up caring about what happened to her and there were a few places where I was emotionally affected by her experiences.Every movie has flaws though. Most of the characters were two-dimensional. Some aspects of this future society, including the technological capabilities of the show producers, bordered on the unbelievable.After looking at the discussion boards, I've discovered that this movie is part of a teenage phenomenon. Many young people see themselves as cognoscenti because they've read the books. They are explaining the movie in light of the book. It seems many fans don't want this movie to be taken at face value -- they want viewers to read the book and they want the movie to be interpreted in that light.Also, some young fans are apparently troubled by comparisons between this movie and earlier movies, between this movie and earlier cultural themes and concepts. Of course, they want the Hunger Games phenomenon (including the movie) to be seen as something fresh and new in our culture.I think we have to remember to respect the fact that a movie is a separate work of art. Books and movies are different media. The book will reveal more detail, including the thoughts of the characters. A movie is much more of a visceral, visual experience. A movie may be loosely based on historical facts or a book, but it will not be the same. And nor should it be.Hunger Games the book and Hunger Games the movie are two different things. They are approached differently. It's not really useful to explain the ""real"" story behind the movie. There is no real story. The movie is what it is. It stands on its own, separate from the historical events or book that gave rise to it. This doesn't effect the validity of the original book or historical events, of course. They can all be enjoyed, but in a different way.Also, many books and movies reflect earlier books, movies and themes that have arisen in our culture. This is a good thing and enriches the experience. Every book and movie will have to rely on artistic elements that went before. Some fans don't want this movie compared to the ""Truman Show"", for example, which was a fantastic, original movie. The movie ""In Time"" also had a future world where people were forced to live in districts with disparate wealth levels.The fans particularly don't want the Hunger Games compared to gladiatorial combat. But to me that's what this movie reminded me of, especially the chariot entrance into the stadium. It was essentially futuristic gladiatorial combat aimed at teenagers. Clearly this is what the author intended or the country wouldn't have been called ""Panem"".It didn't escape my notice that there was not much difference between the 21st century moviegoers and the futuristic audience watching the Hunger Games live. Perhaps not surprisingly, the morality of of sadistic voyeurism was a theme not explored in this movie. This movie might have been improved by the realistic depiction of gore. The violence here, despite being the core of the movie really, was of the goreless Hollywood variety. True gore is too difficult for most people to watch. For me the unrealistic violence mitigated the horror of the situation and the underlying moral point.Hunger Games seems to be aimed at a generation that has grown up watching survivor, reality and game shows where people get ""voted off"".

Distressingly Bad,"I haven't read the book(s) so my review is solely based on the movie.Well I decided watch the movie after reading several positive reviews in this site and to say that I was disappointed would be an understatement.

The World Is Watching.,"The Capitol selects one boy and one girl from each of the 12 districts to compete in a fight till the death on live television event. 24 enter, one leaves, this is the Hunger Games.It's incredibly hard not to compare this film to Battle Royale, I hate to do so, but the similarities are there and unfortunately for The Hunger Games, Battle Royale did it better. In the end, I did like it, but I can't help but feel that it was a lot of build up, with a mediocre delivery of the most important aspect of the film. They talk about how deadly the games are, how it's a fight for survival, but I never really felt that danger. I really do hate comparing it to Battle Royale, but that had a sense of danger. Battle Royale felt deadly, the characters seemed like they've been through hell, you felt sad to see characters die, here, not so much. The most deadly part was the bloodbath that occurred when characters ran to their weapons, then it seemed to be an autopilot. I might be the only one to say this, but this would actually work better as a television show. That way we can feel how devastating these games are, how long they are, how deadly they are. The film does not get this point across, at least not to me.Jennifer Lawrence was good in the lead role of Katniss, the only volunteer for the games. She shows how brave and heroic a female character can be (you suck Bella). She kicks more ass than any other character. That's another downfall, none of the other kids are really memorable. I wanted something unique for each kid to be memorable, but if they didn't speak a line, they were basically ghosts. There are 24 kids, with the exception of the obvious (Lawrence, Hutcherson, the ""villain"" kid, and the little black girl) everyone else fades away. I'm not asking for screen time to be dedicated to each one, but make some of them memorable. I knew who the redhead was because she had red hair, that's it. Again, Battle Royale did this right. They had the tech guys, the evil guy, the medical girls, the crazy girl, the romantics, the hero, etc. The smallest detail is enough to make someone in the background memorable. I had no idea who was dying.The supporting characters are poorly written, specifically Hutherson's character Peeta. Hell, Liam Hemsworth's character Gale does absolutely nothing in the film except brood about Katniss, and yet one little scene where he grabs her little sister to take to her mother screams more about his character than anything Peeta does. Banks, Kravitz and Harrelson all serve to make Katniss all that she can be. Harrelson has some backstory to him, he won a previous game and has since become an alcoholic.I hope more of the world is explored in the follow up films. They barely scratch the surface here, just the basics are given, which is really all we need for the first one, but I was hoping for a bit more of this world to be shown, specifically the Districts. I actually thought that all three books were about the games and that's what the films would be about. So when they wrapped up the game, I thought to myself, where are they going to go from here? But I suspect there will be some uprising and new characters introduced. As a stand lone flick, The Hunger Games works. It doesn't really leave you wanting to go deeper into the story, but it does tell the story it needs to tell and leaves it in a bow for you. It may not be a nice little bow, but it's enough.The detractors of the film are many, like the love between Katniss and Peeta. It's never really explained if she does love him or if she is only doing it for the show and to survive. I suspect the latter will eventually turn into the former, but as of right now, the film does not make this clear. The shaky camera work distracts as well. Even when no action is taking place, we are all over the screen, making it hard to connect to those speaking. The film is also a tad lengthy, which can be bothersome to some, running at two hours and twenty minutes.Despite those nitpicks, the film is entertaining. I guess I just expected a bit more from it, hearing rave reviews and it making millions. The training sequences are exciting and the initial build up, mainly the countdown, to the actual games is thrilling. As I said, I did like the film, I just had to point out those problems. As a film targeted towards teens, I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hoping for action? Bit of a disappointment.,"I read the Hunger Games for a book group and thought it was a good teen novel, light entertainment for adults and mediocre dystopian literature. I was intrigued by the arena and the future technology employed in the fight to the death, though (I was a fan of The Running Man back in the 80s as well.) So I made the comment the story would work well as an action movie. I was told it was going to be a movie, and now it is.Alas, as a teen novel it had to be made PG-13 and to keep that rating the children-killing-children aspect had to be toned down. It was handled by jerky, out-of-focus shots of the actual murders, with clear visuals of either the dead bodies or of the splash of blood or sometimes just an eerie scream. Intense for younger children, appropriate for the target audience, somewhat dull for my bloody taste. I went on a bargain evening though, so for $7 I'm actually satisfied.It's not a cheesy Twilight-like teen romance. The main subject (beyond the story of the central character, Katniss) seems to be the carefully planned violence and tribute ""storylines"" of the ""reality"" broadcasts. It not-so-subtly parallels our own viewing habits and personally I enjoyed the irony. A love story does play a small role, about equal to that of the emotional toll on the children being forced to kill-or-be-killed. Worth a viewing if you have any interest.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It dragged on a bit, but it was a nice effort","The first half of the film could very well have been rated PG, or even G. Then when the Hunger Games actually start, it may as well be a different film, an R rated one.It's total suspense and heart pumping at times, which is good. The shaky camera didn't bother me, as it started only when the kids were fighting and running, keeping with the tone of urgency and desperation. Jennifer Laurence is absolutely brilliant as Katniss Everdeen - which the character has many similarities to that of the Oscar nominated role of Ree in Winter's Bone (taking care of her siblings while her mother is catatonic, facing dangerous situations, never giving up and doing it on her own), and really captures the emotional turmoil her character faces.Now on the other hand, what really bugged me was that the film was too long and really dragged on towards the end, making the ending less than enthusiastic and sort of ruined the prospect of it being a ""game changer"" . Also, the film has a very interesting message and theme: Combining war with reality TV. The way the kids are exploited like they are not human beings is really horrifying, but the film focuses more on the action rather than the message and the reasons for these terrible Hunger Games.The book was brilliant, but the film really could have been much better. 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Not Bad for a Book Adaptation,"I am a college freshman. Wondering why exactly The Hunger Games had so much hype, I decided to read the books and then check out the movie. I finished the series in three days and became thoroughly pumped for the film, since it doesn't look like the low budget poo of another young adult book adaptation (coughTwilightcough). But this isn't the place for complaining about that.In terms of following the book, The Hunger Games movie did remarkably well. This can be a good or bad thing. Of course, in order to condense the story many small details were cut. Small, but important to fully understanding the story. Depth, character development, these things are all sacrificed in the movie, which can lead to an unsatisfying middle ground where fans aren't happy and non-fans are confused as to what's going on.Casting of the characters was better than expected. Jennifer Lawrence makes a convincing enough Katniss, although she is way too tall and curvy to actually seem like she was suffering. I don't really know how that could be fixed though. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was...unsatisfying. Basically he was there to look wide-eyed and weak. Same with Prim. I hated how the movie makers interpreted Prim as a whiny, scream-y useless kid. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket was funny and spot-on, Haymitch was meh, President Snow wasn't bad but not as I imagined.Cinematography was very...shaky, as mentioned in other reviews. Also, the books were quite explicit in describing the violence in the arena, but the movie muted this quite a bit. Most scenes go something like this: someone waves/throws a weapon, the camera zooms around in a blurry manner, and the audience is shown the result (a gash, an arrow in something) without actually seeing the process. This really couldn't be helped if they wanted the PG-13 rating, given the teen fanbase, but it truly reduces the impact and power of the movie. It's fine with me though. The Hunger Games isn't supposed to be horror, per se. I think the series is a good introduction to thinking more deeply about human nature, society, war, and violence. It is STILL a story for kids! As for the Battle Royale thing, BR is distinctly more...Japanese. It's sick, twisted, and gloriously, insanely violent. Its purpose is to shock you and give you chills, maybe make you think about things once you get over the gore, which depends on your taste obviously. The Hunger Games dabbles in these parts, yes, but it's much more hopeful. It taps into the viewer's emotions and sympathy, and advocates that good people still have a chance.Anyway, basically The Hunger Games movie is pretty decent in getting the point across, although small things are lost in the process.

Don't judge a movie by its book.,"While I do agree the book was better, that doesn't in any way make this movie worse than it actually is.

One casting to ruin them all,"It was truly a wrong decision to cast Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. The lack of chemistry and compatibility with the role was so glaringly obvious to me while watching.People might think that looking older than a young girl is not an issue, but I believe it's quite problematic. After all, the age of the main character has significant implications for many plot mechanics. If the main character appears too mature in appearance, it could make it much harder for the audience to buy into the drama of the story, which revolves around a teenager trying to fill the role of her mother.The real issue is indeed the complete lack of compatibility between Lawrence's acting and the character. She plays the character with an incredible emotional constipation. It's clear they wanted her to portray a character who struggles to express her emotions, but I can't think of a word better than ""cringe"" to describe how she translates that onto the screen. The character's intended pride, strength, and personality all got crushed and vanished due to Lawrence's attempt to sell her shyness through an edgy, forced role.The strong concept, storyline, and world-building are undermined with Lawrence's acting. The main material of this film indeed has a truly solid. The screenplay does have plot convenient events happening, but these could have been seamlessly integrated into the film with good acting.

Too concerned about the rules,"Too concerned about the rules. Since the rules can be changed arbitrarily by the game maker, the game participants can also choose to comply or not.

The best of the franchise,"The first instalment of the series and in my opinion - the only film adaptation that actually succeeded in realizing the world of Panem and bring the characters to life.This movie stands out compared to the rest because it really set the tone and standard for what it should have been like for its successors, which sadly, the others failed to meet.Director Gary Ross managed to bring out the human emotions and convey them without needing the characters to actually say anything at times. His creative approach was quite heartfelt and he did a tremendous job with the Reaping scene especially which filled one with anxiety as if one was part of it too.Moreover, the interaction between the characters were exciting and satisfying to watch and I really wish we could have seen more of that kind of storytelling. This is where the sequels fail devastatingly and end up looking very artificial, especially the main characters.The Hunger Games lived and died with the work of Mr. Ross and his team in the first movie which in my opinion is the best of them all. It is organic and manages to move one.I was never content with the rest of the sequels as they failed to create real human connection and resorted to the Hollywoodesque/Major Motion picture action and drama where quality is overlooked.Subconsciously, I am still waiting for the sequels to happen.

Honestly not as bad as everyone makes it out to be,"First off, I have never read the books and did not even want to see the movie because this is normally something I am not interested in. And to make matters worse all of the people giving it a 1- star? Or would like to give it a zero? It honestly is not that bad. The movie itself is based off of a book so the people that have an issue with the author's concept of children fighting to the death should not watch it, and those who do should not complain because they should have known what the movie was about before they watched it. The idea is pretty interesting and while some of the acting in a few of the cases could have been better I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit. And with 3 other movies already lined up, I'm sure some of the story line will come together in the end. So while everyone says its horrible, I say watch it anyhow. If you hate it, you hate it. If not then hopefully its interesting and enjoyable. But for everyone that comes on here just to complain about how god awful it is, you need to remember that it's rated pg-13 and that they are trying to appeal to a younger audience.

A great movie with an interesting ending,"This film is outstanding in my opinion, because I have not yet been able to find analogues. This film exaggerates the system in the modern world. The essence of that universe is as follows: There is a center, a city in which the elite live, and there are 12 districts (cities, regions), each of which supplies something to the main city. The first three or four districts live normally, they are hardly oppressed, but the rest live in slavery. In that universe, there is an annual event that serves as a reminder of the districts' failed rebellion against the government and keeps the districts in line to this day: the Hunger Games. It is an event at which only one person out of 24 survives each year. Two people from each district are selected each year for the Hunger Games, and one year, in place of her little sister, the main character Kitniss volunteers, who becomes an idol and role model for many. This movie tells the story of a brave, strong and self-sacrificing girl who proves time and time again that nothing is impossible, you just have to put in the effort. I recommend this film to absolutely everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Vampires Suck  A** And Sparkle!,"""The Hunger Games"" is a promising beginning in what looks to be, hopefully, another successful movie franchise and a most welcome antidote to the dreadful ""Twilight"" movies...This opening salvo works on all cylinders. A good job was done by all parties involved given the movie's modest (by today's standards) budget. Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz and Woody Harrelson round-up a good cast.Jennifer Lawrence though, truly is the centre piece of this movie. Without her in the lead role, I doubt that the movie would have been as good as it ended up being.I have not read the books, so this review is solely based on the movie itself. I found it strange that a lot of people bring up ""Battle Royale"" as the movie they most compare ""The Hunger Games"" with, but fail to also bring up George Orwell's novel ""1984"" or Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"". I rather think that ""The Hunger Games"" has undertones of those stories, and that is a positive thing!Based on this first instalment, I will be in the theatre when the next chapter comes to the big-screen. I am not a huge fan, or an established one, since I have not read the books, but as a moviegoer, I was not disappointed!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Cinema,"I love living in ignorance. I never read any of the books, and before coming here to appreciate the film verbally after watching it for the first time on DVD, I never knew that the plot of the books upon which the film was based was similar to another set of books that I also never read. Fortunately, I do not care to read either set of books, and, most gratefully, I hadn't yet been polluted by all the trollish trash back and forth here on this board and in these reviews, so I was able to enjoy the movie objectively, having not read anything about it.I can say that when the film is watched on its own merit - i.e., without all that unnecessary baggage - it stands out as a truly impressive production. I thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle. The premise of the film is quite absurd, requiring huge suspension of disbelief, so to get oneself in a lather about plot niceties regarding this particular kind of fictional universe is nonsensical.No society populated by humans beings (homo sapiens sapiens) would allow the type of behavior typified in this movie to go on for so long. Rebellion would happen from the inside. People wouldn't just merrily go along with it. It's ridiculous to think otherwise. It's science fiction, occurring in a parallel universe of something like human beings, but not quite. That being the case, one would hope there would be more productive things to do than rabid fanboi bickering, but no, sadly.The pageantry was fabulous. Art direction was stellar. Acting was superb. (Until the credits rolled, I had no idea that was Elizabeth Banks behind that makeup and hair! I make a point to hear as little as possible about a film before I see it.) The score was first class. The story moved within its own logic very nicely, I felt for many of the characters, and I can't wait for the sequel for what was obviously just the opening act. This review from objectivity is the best praise I can give.I do hope that should some of the makers of this film be so unfortunate as to feel the need to read the rants, they must realize the insults and trolling mean nothing. (Most who are like me would just go away from the toxicity, rather than try to insert something good into all the nastiness.) Keep up the great work! I'll see the next one on the big screen, for sure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good source material, mediocre direction, mildly entertaining","This movie is like Battle Royale for teens, except that that kind of movie is not remotely for children, or even many adults. That's part of the issue with The Hunger Games. It has the tone of a coming-of-age, slightly edgy, young adult action romance, but the most interesting parts of the movie feel more like A Clockwork Orange, Saw or Se7en.This is not a cute and cuddly story, however much it tries to include that kind of stuff. It wants to have its cake and eat it too and it doesn't work. The most violent, intense parts work the best but nothing else fits with it.The direction is bland. What else has the director made? Nobody knows. No vision, no style. Way too often, he uses close-ups or medium shots so we can't see the environment properly. Like so many weak directors (Abrams, for example), he thinks he just has to show the characters and their intense emotions and we'll be won over. No, it doesn't work like that.We have to connect with the world, understand it, understand what the characters want and why. Only then will we feel something. The Hunger Games does some of that, but I can tell most of the inspiration is coming from the book, not the direction or acting, which are much more average.Jennifer Lawrence is fine in the main role, nothing amazing, but she suits the role. There are just a few too many close-ups where I'm really not sure what she's thinking or why it matters. I don't care that much. I want the world and the events to be interesting. Then I can project myself onto the main character, like with Luke Skywalker, for example.We connect with Luke over time. Star Wars doesn't expect us to cry when he faces tragedy - and there are several pivotal events/scenes. But it does want us to root for him by the end. We've seen what the bad guys are capable and now the stakes are really high. Too many movies expect too much empathy too early, including The Hunger Games.Katniss (which constantly reminded me of cat piss and/or catnip, not a great choice for a name) has a younger sister whose only purpose seems to be to gain our empathy. But the sister is overly emotional and kind of annoying. We don't even know anything about her interests. It's so generic. The same with the mother. Make us LIKE the characters, let them do fun or normal things, THEN we'll care. Don't show them constantly crying - that's dull.The overall plot has some interesting twists and turns - the book is clearly pretty interesting. But as a film, it does very little with the material. A few parts work quite well - when the games start, for example. No sound, but a pretty crazy adrenaline rush, and probably pretty realistic.Speaking of realism, I have my doubts that females would last long at all in such a challenge. Okay, Katniss is good with a bow and arrow. But, on average, I don't see girls surviving for long, with all due respect. I can only suspend disbelief for so long and the completely failure of the movie to address this insane imbalance is strange, indeed. Imagine having a big sport match between boys and girls and the characters all act like it's a 50/50 toss up. Yeah, sure.At times, key issues didn't seem to be addressed. In particular, if I was Katniss, I would have been so furious at one point. I kept wanting her to ask or say certain things to someone else. When the main character no longer seems to have basic common sense or self-respect, it gets really frustrating.Also, she sometimes tells someone else to be quiet. Why? It's such a stupid cliche. Just let them say it! ""Go on without me!"" ""No, I'm not leaving you."" ""But..."" ""Shhhh..."" And I just died of cringe. If I've seen it 500 times before, add a twist or do it really, really well.Some of the CGI has already dated although it wasn't horrendous. It's the kind of thing where you can instantly tell something is fake without being able to exactly explain how. But it reduces the immersion nevertheless.Again, the tone was one of the main issues. We're talking life and death here. You don't have time for your cute little, 90s sitcom moments. At times it felt like Fresh Prince of Bel Air, with characters making jokes or learning lessons, in between teenagers brutally murdering each-other.Not enough is explained about the world. In short - I don't buy it. None of it makes sense. Big gaps between rich and poor? It can happen, but always for a reason. And no reason is given here. Where is the wealth coming from? We don't know. Like most movies which have a disenfranchised poor group, it completely ignores culture, as if no such thing exists. They must be poor because of malevolent baddies.The same with the glamorisation of death. It's just not sustainable. People wouldn't accept that. I guess the sequels will probably go into that. The fashion is also strange. I mean, who knows, people wear all kinds of weird things, but this just feels fake. Ironically, all the actors, both playing rich and poor characters, look like they've just put their costumes and make-up on right before the camera started rolling.Since I've only seen the first movie, I think it's fine for me to speculate about the sequels. I think there'll be a massive revolution (or an attempt at one) which tries to end The Hunger Games and eventually brings all the Districts together in peace and prosperity. The rich, evil people will learn their lesson and the poor will revolt, etc. But deeper questions about human nature, or how economics actually works, will go untouched. I'll find out.One of the simplest issues with The Hunger Games is just that it's boring, a little too laborious with some of the plot points, a little too artificial with its emotions. Quite a few cliches as well. The villains are 1-dimensional and we learn nothing about the people of the Capitol or what they think and why. In The Truman Show, we get glimpses of the people watching from home - what kind of people they are and how they react.Also, the movie cheats to make Katniss look better. She only ever kills in self-defence, which is convenient. She never has to face the prospect of killing a child to win and survive, others do things for her. It's a contrived way to elevate Katniss morally and it feels unearned. Realistically, people aren't all good or evil and you'd face some real moral and psychological dilemmas if put into a fight for your life.THG plays with your emotions too often. Because of the nature of the story, most characters are disposable and this gets abused way too much. It feels arbitrary which characters we (or Katniss) are meant to care about - whatever enhances the drama of the moment.I don't regret missing The Hunger Games all these years but at least I've got a few movies to distract myself with now.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hated it,"Hated this movie. Nothing at all like the book. Which, of course, was sooo much better. They changed a lot of things that shouldn't have been changed. I griped the entire movie when watching it at home. Thank god I didn't rent this movie. At least it was a free rental because it would have been a complete waste of money. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Read the books. They are worth your time unlike this movie was. It would have been much better if they had stuck with the plot lines in the book. Instead they changed so much that you wouldn't be able to recognize any part of the book except in some parts. They only part that I think they did get right was the actor who played Haymitch. If I was able to give this movie a zero rating I would. For all of those who enjoyed this movie, to each their own.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good movie! HORRIBLE Directing and cinematography!!!,"Great casting and costumes!! By why, oh why, did the director jump the camera around so much!! It was almost a joke how much he did it. It ruined the movie experience for me. It brought it down from a 8/10 to a 6/10. And I like hand held camera movies when done right. I loved Cloverfield and Chronicle. This wasn't just a hand held shaking camera, it was out of focus at times, zooming in from all crazy angles, jumping around every second. The worst part is the director did it on purpose!!! Look at this quote from the director describing to Sodenberg, who was filming a sequence for him, on how to copy his style.Transcription of secret tape of Ross explaining Hunger Games cinematography asethetic to Soderbergh: ""Just pretend that the camera is a bouncing rubber ball on LSD, and that you have this weird compulsion for closeups. You know what I mean? You're trying to follow the action and you do follow it but almost in an accidental, stumbling-around way. All you gotta remember is close-ups, close-ups and more close-ups. And constantly bouncy, bouncy, bouncy. Just keep bouncing, man...in fact, forget the rubber ball thing. Pretend that the camera is a f%ing basketball...okay? A f#%ing basketball with a obsession for closeups. Do that and you can't go wrong.""You got to be kidding me.

"unoriginal in concept, but a rather enjoyable film.","I enjoyed this film, yet couldn't stop thinking of either series 7-battle royale-the running man just based on the storyline on it's own and the design just made me think of Dr.Seuss with a slash of Marilyn Manson and Lady Gaga, and i think that if this movie becomes a mass hit without people really noticing the whole premise of the film, that we are all barbaric consumers. sort of a catch 22 situation there. But anyway, the movie was enjoyable, I felt moved and enthralled, suspense even, but it is sadly nothing all that special really, just another teen fad movie that will probably be rotting on a blockbuster shelf in 10 years time. i hope i'm wrong as i think it's a bit better than that but face it, it's where a lot of these new movies are heading.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The game is on,"Based on the best-selling futuristic young adult books by Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games has the essence of classic dystopian literary or film works like 1984, THX 1138 or, more specifically, Stephen King's The Running Man, but manages to weave its own spellbinding originality and present a fascinating story with a complexity and integrity which a good adaptation can boast, and which is rarely achieved with films not adapted from literature.We follow two teenagers from the poor and remote District 12 in a future nation ridden with war and disaster. Having been chosen to represent their district in the annual Hunger Games, a contest or rather an involuntary battle of life and death, the two find themselves fighting for their lives together with a group of other scared-to-death teenagers in which the last man standing wins eternal fame and glory. There are no rules, but plenty of cameras - through which the rest of the nation watches and roots for their district's contestants.One of the best parts of The Hunger Games is how delicately the film portrays the unhealthiness of it all: the kids' fear, the nation's charade of pride, excitement and glory, and all the well written and acted humanity in the midst of it all. Like other examples of mass suggestion (such as Nazi Germany), the allure and glory seemingly overshadows the immorality, and we the viewers are left in the same predicament as the spectators of the Hunger Games; we know it's wrong, but we still want to watch.The story's underlying themes, of the elite wanting to control and subdue the masses, have already been more than sufficiently explored on film in the past, but what director Gary Ross (Pleasantville) is able to convey in terms of pertinent drama and tension in the fascinating setup is nothing short of amazing. The brilliant visuals, including the masterful set design by Larry Dias, add to this effect, as does the fine acting from a number of inspired players, including the talented Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone) in the lead role, a fun Stanley Tucci as the TV host, and a brilliant Woody Harrelson as a previous and disillusioned champion of the games. The game is on. Now let's just hope this film isn't tarnished by a number of sequels, which seems to have become the norm in adaptations in this sub-genre lately.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great movie if you don't mind patronising approach,"After the rebellion in Empire somewhere in a future, the punishment is set for 12 rebelled districts. The Capitol selects a boy and a girl from each district who fight to death on live television. Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her younger sister's place for the latest match.The movie is based on the first novel in the Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, published in 2008. It was probably the most advertised film of the spring, and, given the bestseller nature of the books, the film to wait for. And the fans will not be put down.Art always follows the mood of the crowd, reflects it and tries to satisfy the desires of the majority. This is why the occurrence of the anti-Utopian and post-apocalyptic movie was actually predictable given the world-wide movements like ""Occupy Wall-Street"". The society filed a demand for another ""V for Vendetta"", and the movie industry (as well as book-publishing) rushed to satisfy it.The whole movie feels split into roughly two parts. In the first part, authors try to produce anti-utopia with all the necessary attributes. Suppression, fear, anger at the elites, excesses of the Capitol; all the components seem to be in place. Lonely hero, revolting masses, uniformed Special Forces – it took all the best from other anti-utopias. The second part feels like ""The Last Survivor"". Well, a bit more brutal. The movie almost forgets its anti-Utopian start and concentrates on action, reminding more of ""Predators"" and other movies about survival in the jungles. And the thing is that these two parts are as if they are filmed by two different people.The action part is tense, full of unexpected turns of the story line and genuinely breath-taking at moments. It is a joy and entertainment to watch, it is easy to empathize with the main characters, it is a thrilling movie to watch. But the anti-utopia part is in reality more of ""Anti-utopia for children"" – every single bit is carefully chewed and given to the audience for easy digestion. It is like 1984-lite: colorful, stylish, with charismatic characters, but absolutely dull. I honestly believe that the audience is smart enough to understand the purpose of the games. I do believe that everybody will understand what is going on the screen, without any need to revert to patronizing explanations which leave the taste of a kindergarten lessons.The cast played its part well. No revelations, no awe-inspiring performance, no Oscar-hopefuls. Straightforward work, no more, no less. I would only single out Lenny Kravitz. He managed to put life in his character, a lot of charisma and some personal touch to it, making it very natural and pretty positive. As concerned Jennifer Lawrence who played the main character, I honestly don't understand why there is a need for her to do everything with an open mouth. She hunts with open mouth, she sleeps with open mouth, she is angry with open mouth – etc. It was supposed to make her look hot, but instead she looks a bit lost and silly. Other than that, everybody seems to be in place and knowing what to do.P.S. I hated the camera work. The shaking image always unsettles me, I never quite grasped why would you want to use it? It is not how people see the world when they are nervous. It is simply a camera given to a man who has shaking hands. As a result, the whole movie feels like a ride on a very poor road rather than nice smooth journey. Maybe that was the intention? Because of this feature the final fight also lacks some pathos and tension. Instead, it looks like the cameraman himself participates in the fight.VERDICT: Despite pretty patronizing approach to the audience as concerned the ideological part, the movie is still great watch: captivating, breathtaking, interesting and with a little pinch of content for those of us who look for something more than simple action movie.m-picturegoer.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"I was very excited to see the movie because of all the good reviews given to it by fans and critics alike. I guess that was what raised my expectations about the movie, especially all the mentions about how faithful it was to the source material and how it was one of the best book to movie adaptation in recent times.I won't dwell on the technicalities of the movie because I don't know much about those, I personally judge if a movie was good or not based on how it made me feel about the characters being portrayed. I must say that if I didn't read and loved the book, I wouldn't care about any of the characters. It didn't matter to me what happened to them, I just wanted for the movie to be over so that I can continue appreciating the book as if the movie never existed.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The film has an interesting setting, style and succeeds with pacing, and characterization.","Unlike some veteran reviewers, I pretty much knew I was going to like The Hunger Games. This is mostly due to my own enjoyment of dystopian and post-apocalyptic settings in general media. But, to counter my own statement of enjoyment, I didn't know how much I would like this, my bar was set pretty low at 2.5, which is the minimal passing score for my rating scale. The reason behind this is behind few exceptions I hate the genre of fiction known as young adult. It's simplistic, pandering, insulting and cliché. It simply is and with writers like Stephanie Meyer this can not be dismissed as a radical bias as there is some truth to it. But I did pick up the Hunger Games novel about a month ago and I ended up being interested on how it was going to be adapted. Let me say this before I say anything else, I believe Jennifer Lawrence is a talent that can't be denied. Calling her talentless, unemotive, stale or any negative term is just objectively wrong. If you don't think so please do yourself a favor and go watch Winter's Bone and to a lesser extent, The Burning Plain or The Poker House. Both were movies that really got me excited for her as a performer. This girl has range, ability and method and while in The Hunger Games it doesn't show completely, she does show the characters three dimensions. The plot is paced very well, with minor inconsistences with camera steadiness, but it does add some thrilling action-esque feel to the scenes even if it sacrifices emotion and reaction. At the end of the day, I can agree with Catherine Reitman on Josh Hutcherson being miscast. I do think higher of him then others, but he just didn't fit or he didn't for me. I also think Wes Bentley just didn't stick either, in appearance I think it was great but when he opened his mouth it seemed dreaded with blandness. I imagined the character presented would of had a thinner, more suave voice and characterization. But otherwise it was only a minor thing that irked me. Everyone else but these two sank into their roles, especially Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks; whom I didn't even recognize until the ending credits.The film has an interesting setting, style and succeeds with pacing, characterization and only falters when it comes to some blurps that can't be helped either due to casting or source material. This is probably the most finely crafted young adult thing I have experienced since maybe Brian Jacques adapted Redwall to the television screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Lazy adaptation,"One Word: RushedI had high hopes for this movie. It could've been much better. Instead, it is just a normal popcorn flick that takes its source material for granted.Some important scenes doesn't have a proper lead-in to explain the action. Some were left out entirely. This makes some of them have less impact than what they were gunning for, instead, it induces awkwardness, even if one knows the reason for the scene. I'm not even talking about the symbol of the story that have been reduced to mere trinket.So, my advice is, go and see the movie with your hopes dialed down. This is not a faithful adaptation, even the casting is way off. Its a shame really, such misstep is truly unexpected.It could've trumped Twilight and takes its place as the leader in teen movie franchises. Instead, it happily place itself in the middle of the pack.I guess, THE ODDS IS NOT IN YOUR FAVOR, THG.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Hunger Games (2012),"The Hunger Games will always fail in comparison to one of my favourite films of all time that shall remain nameless. The book was embarrassingly bad. Poor writing, with no idea about characterisation, conflict, or pacing. Luckily Gary Ross is a much better filmmaker than Suzanne Collins is a writer. He manages to capture those silent moments of thought which allow the audience to breathe and contemplate what is happening. Unlike Collins' non-stop 1st person narrative from Katniss, which included every one of her mundane thoughts. She's a character that doesn't speak much, and this is better represented in this film. Lawrence gives a great performance and knows when a look is more than a speech. In fact, the whole cast do well. Like the book, the first half is more interesting, as we see the build-up to the games. The ceremony and pomposity is what hides this cruel sense of torture. It's in the second half where the film (like the book) begins to lose its pace. Ross does the best he can with having to deliver a PG-13 film. There was actually more violence than expected. However, the amount of violence wouldn't have changed a thing as we simply don't know nor care about the characters killed. They are nothing but fodder for the action scenes. It's strange to feel so empty at watching kids die. There's never a question about how this film is going to end because it is too cowardly. The amount of incidental deaths caused by accident are so high it relieves these kids of making any choices. It's still a fun watch for the most part, and simply by being better than the book it deserves a lot of respect.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Something that Knits Us All Together,"Based on the first part of a trilogy of books with the same name by Suzanne Collins, ""The Hunger Games"" is set in an unspecified post-apocalyptic and peaceful future. The price of food is rocketing. The citizens of the Capitol, the fortress city of the rich and powerful, annually select, through a lottery, a young boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of the twelve districts to fight with each other to death. This is done live on television, leaving only one winner. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers instead of her younger sister to lead this fierce battle.16 year-old Katniss hails from the distinctly poor district 12, and area known for its rich supply of coal. She shows a rebellious streak and is the breadwinner who feeds her mother and younger sister. She has a talent for illegally hunting to sell goods on the black market with her best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth).'The Hunger Game' is introduced in the film as ""something that knits us all together"" from the creator of this bloody live show. The poorer districts ask for food from the government; their names appear in the lottery. It's a life defined by day-to-day survival.The two selected protagonists of district 12, Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are moved to the Capitol, where the conglomeration of technology and money are based. Like gladiators, they are treated like stars with big banquets and fancy clothes before they're sent off to their deaths in an outdoor arena.They meet their drunken trainer and previous winner Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), who introduces them to the manipulative nature of the game. Basically they have to please the audience in order to get more sponsors who will provide them with gifts of food and crucial items when they're out there fighting for their lives.Katniss understands she's nothing but mere entertainment for the rich living in Capitol. Her bravery in standing up for her sister has already given her more points, but she has to keep it up by employing her talents in order to shift public opinion in her favor while audiences anticipating death.The film is an analogy of the manipulation of media in our modern times, and how end-users are at the service of darker powers. I was reminded of Noam Chomsky, who has revealed the mass media schemes through the ""manufacture of fear"" in order to reach control.Media manipulation is not new to Hollywood, from ""Wag the Dog"", ""1984"" and ""The Truman Show"", all hint in different ways, the power of the media industry in shifting people's opinions towards war. But this is probably the first time this argument has been pitched at a younger generation.Oscar nominated Jennifer Lawrence (""Winter's Bone"") has proved once more that she's a formidable presence. The film, on the other hand, sometimes lacks details that would have moved it closer to perfection. There are some irrelevant futuristic costumes, and an under-developed storyline about the father-like daughter relationship between Lenny Kravitz and Katniss. The film is open for analogy with the current uprisings in the Middle East. As the film says, hope is ""the only thing stronger than fear"".Find the rest of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education, at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

"The Hunger Games franchise is born proving not to underestimate the public, creating something new and modern and finds space for a series of social criticisms","In the distant future, a good part of the population is controlled by a totalitarian regime, which recalls this domain by holding an annual - and deadly - event among the 12 districts under its tutelage. To save her younger sister, young Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to represent her district in the competition and ends up counting on the company of Peeta Melark (Josh Hutcherson), challenging not only the dominant system, but also the strength of the other opponents.In this purest bread and circus, there is an interesting anthropological analysis, focused on the criticism of elites and corruption by power. In addition, the narrative always shows the main characters acting in their own interests, except for the pro-revolution mass, which, like Katniss, serves as an instrument of the Revolt. In addition to the dispute for power in several spheres, contemporary and real issues such as segregation, slave labor, abusive state and extreme poverty are present. Although Panem is a futuristic vision of the USA, it hyperbolically bears the traces of a strong capitalist state. What inspired the author Suzanne Collins to write the trilogy was the live broadcast of the Iraq War on American television, as well as the traditional reality shows, the Roman gladiators and the Greek myth of Theseus.As the author of the books was involved in the creation of the script, she wanted to remain faithful to the message of the source work and, with that, what we have on screen is a dynamic adventure, very well adapted to the cinema and that makes a point of dealing the subject in a more mature way, avoiding the trap of ""teen films"". Of all these recent great franchises, the first adaptation of Suzanne Collins' literary trilogy is the one with the most challenging content, with inspiration from great dystopic works such as Brave New World, the aforementioned 1984 and, in the next books, even Fahreinheit 451. Discussions about authority, celebrity worship, obedience, power and control are at stake in the story that takes place in the futuristic ruins of North America, divided into a capital and 12 districts.Starting from a premise that is frightening, due to the high level of violence inherent in the nature of the games - the participants, some preteens, have to kill each other -, Gary Ross manages, throughout the 144 minutes of the film, to keep the public interest. Its direction, as well as the script, balances action scenes and moments in which the complexity of the central characters has the chance to emerge, opening space to criticize a society that consumes itself, having as main entertainment the manipulation of other people's lives. . As it could not fail to be in a blockbuster, this critical bias is not the focus of the film. But it is always present, permeating the entire narrative and even having certain moments of greater attention. This social subplot, although contained, presents itself to a greater degree than usual for films of this size, with a commercial proposal and a youth target audience.The mature character in relation to other productions of the genre is a reflection of the competent direction of Gary Ross, who is concerned with approaching the theme with more drama and less romanticism and pyrotechnics. The first act is the best example of this atmosphere. The characters are patiently presented in their routine actions and we only get to know their personalities during the course of the plot. The clichés, which need to exist, are worked on in order to integrate them into the plot or the psychology of the characters, making them less uncomfortable. The soundtrack by T-Bone Burnett and James Newton Howard is limited to the brief transition sequences, remaining quite subtle, which provides space for silence in the most dramatic scenes. This gives a sober and realistic tone to the feature which, at least in this first part, does not push the viewer towards a kind of cheap emotional reaction.Ross even opts for a style of camera and editing in the action scenes that elegantly deviates from barbarism, giving glimpses of it, but taking out the graphic impact that could make them fetishists (and, obviously, make the film commercially viable in terms of indicative classification). The director presents all the important elements of the narrative without losing the rhythm, sometimes using flashbacks without dialogues, something that ends up valuing the film, given the air of seriousness that it prints, besides being efficient to expand the series mythology and the depth of the characters. With a well done montage, Ross manages, at the same time, to pass the impression of temporal passage and a frantic rhythm, which does not give the viewer much time to think, certainly to highlight the issue of manipulating images, but also to give a tone from documentary to film, he chose to use the ""camera in hand"" technique, which causes some strangeness at first, but which we get used to later. His style brings more urgency to the context of the story and, even though Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling exaggerate the crowded montage of quick cuts, it makes the experience a little more ""adult"" if we take into account the technical exhibition of most films aimed at the audience young.But it is the script that manages to stand out. First of all, it is encouraging to see that a well-formulated work - and full of allegories - has managed to find its way into teenager minds (this considering what something frivolous like The Twilight Saga has collected in recent years). Collins' plot owes credit to previous work, but it still creates something new and modern and finds space for a series of social criticisms. The initial mood is radically transformed when we are introduced to the program's consumers. The bizarre makeup and costumes designed by Judianna Makovsky refer to the artificiality of the people of the Capital. Extravagance and color are contrasted with the gray tones of the less favored population. Art directors John Collins, Robert Fechtman and Paul Richards bet on a simplistic and square architecture of the sets, as if everything was built just for practicality, with no human touch to the decorations. At this moment, we realize how much that society is a product and hostage of the old and always current policy of ""bread and circus"". And when it comes to media control (wouldn't the deplorable reality shows of certain national television networks be the ""The Hunger Games"" of our time? What if no one watched them anymore, as Katniss suggests?).The writers condense the story of the book without forgetting the most important aspects. There are several modifications of the original work, but extremely necessary for the adaptation to work in the audiovisual media in a satisfactory way. Characters are entirely cut out of the narrative and others have a very low profile (like Gale, for example), but if it were not so, the film would have fallen into the trap of trying to reproduce, not effectively adapting a story. Another interesting aspect of the script is the more constant presence of elements of science fiction, although the special effects, in many moments, but especially in the final sequence, are sufferable. We see not only futuristic hovercrafts and an extremely modern Capital, elements contained in the book, but we also participate in the control of the Games directly from the ""war"" room, in which Master Idealizer Seneca Crane and his team determine every detail of what happens in the arena, ""helping to remind the public of the artificiality of the arena"". And this character, which is only mentioned in the book, is very well developed in the film, as an element to allow the fluidity of the narrative. All this development ends up contributing to a more organic ending to the film, which does not create strangeness as in the book.Also to help in the narrative, we have several cuts for the presenter Caesar Flickerman, something like the presenter of this universe to the audience, to literally explain, without seeming artificial, several events in the games. For example, the explanation of genetically altered wasps would sound forced out of the mouth of any character in the arena, but for Flickerman, the narrative works very well. And the teen romance had its presence reduced to the exact measure, making Katniss's character even more believable than in the book.Anyway, The Hunger Games is a great action movie, with a lean script that could have had the effect of reducing its enormous duration. However, even with almost two and a half hours, the tape flows smoothly. The film entertains in the right measure and, incredible as it may seem, it makes one think, thanks to the base material that manages to go beyond a simple deadly competition and, also, to the author's talent also in the creation of a script that does not forget the non-aspects focused on action, something increasingly difficult to find in a Hollywood blockbuster. In times of reality shows, where the exposure of intimacy, social masks and personal judgments define our culture, nothing is more convenient than a film that pins these new customs precisely as a product consumed by the new generation. The Hunger Games franchise is born proving not to underestimate the public, delivering quality entertainment with openness to reflections more linked to our own real context.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Review for the Over-40 crowd who never read the book.,"DISCLAIMER: This review sets up the situations of the movie without revealing the ending.If you take the reality show ""Survivor"" and re-imagine it in ancient Rome, you might get the idea behind ""The Hunger Games"", a televised contest where 24 teenagers compete to be the last one standing. There's one catch, however. They earn that victory by hunting down and murdering the others. The story take place in a futuristic dystopia called Panem where the central authority, ""The Capital"" demands that the twelve formerly rebellious outlying districts send two ""tributes""; kids between ages 12-18, to battle in the Games. All are picked by lottery. Once chosen, they are pampered like modern day reality stars before being sent into the forest with whatever weapons and supplies they can muster.The story focuses on the brave and resourceful Katniss Everdeen (played by the extraordinary Jennifer Lawrence), who volunteers to take the place of her younger sister. The first few scenes are excellent and chilling. Katniss's home, District 12, is an impoverished coal mining backwater that eerily mimics the Appalachian locale of Lawrence's last film, the equally bleak ""Winter's Bone"". The children are chosen at a staged event, called a ""reaping"", at the train station in a vignette that echoes (deliberately, I assume) the Selection Platform processing at Auschwitz.Once at the Capital, the story sags somewhat. This is supposedly where the rich, venal rulers congregate but, adorned as they are with exaggerated costumes and grotesque florescent hair styles, they look more like extras from a Fellini film. They come off as silly, not threatening, especially Stanley Tucci as the unctuous Ryan Seacrest-like MC who is cursed with a blue-tinted pompadour. The entire sequence is meant to mock the celebrity/reality show culture of our present day but it comes off a bit forced. The only character who radiates menace is Donald Sutherland's President Snow and he is dressed in plain formal attire.The story picks up again when the youngsters begin to battle although it's unsettling to see children casually slaughtering each other. Katniss is paired with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson in a tender, underplayed role), a boy from her home district and their love story, ruthlessly exploited by the show's controllers, provides the backdrop for what transpires.""The Hunger Games"", the beginning of the trilogy by author Suzanne Collins (who also wrote the screenplay), promises future sequels which will hopefully give more back story to Panem's beginnings and more challenges for the riveting and poignant Katniss Everdeen. These stories are aimed at teenage readers and it is easy to see their appeal. Combining elements of love and heroism, it also plays out every teen's revenge fantasy of getting back at the creeps who ignore them in the cafeteria and bully them in the hallways. A typical American high school is a true Hunger Games survival setting. The only difference is that the bloodletting is emotional, not physical.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hunger Games Was A Complete Incredibly Well Done Battle Royale Movie,"I'm actually a fan of Battle Royale type of movie, and The Hunger Games might be one of the other one that are very well executed not only in terms of the game itself, but in terms of story development and characters development are so well done, The Hunger Games fills with this 1 hour build up to the game and i never once felt that it was too long that i just hope they need to go to the game immediately, because the build up of The Hunger Games was really really engaging, and it makes you care even more about the two main character of the film, also great performances by all the supporting actor especially Lenny Kravitz who surprise me with his really good performance in this movie, the set was pretentious even though it was CGI, talking about CGI, all the tiny flaws that i have for the movie was some of the CGI wasn't that good and couple of slow scene and that was it, the rest of The Hunger Games pretty much perfect, the relationship between Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson was good, there is real emotion to the film that i really happily felt, and the movie was actually pretty long, almost 2 in a half hour long and i didn't feel it at all because how much i was so invested to the movie, it was intense, it was exciting, i was rooting for them means i care about the main character, all the cast played it greatly, it was a surprisingly really good movie, overall The Hunger Games could go even more hardcore, but for a Hollywood version, The Hunger Games nailed it pretty much everything from the performances, build up story, main story, the game itself, and on the emotional level, it is a complete incredibly well done Battle Royale movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Clumsy story-telling but JLaw saved the day,"I didn't read the books, so am not drowned in disappointment.But yes, many reviewers are right, flawed script, flawed directing.Agreed - stupid shaky cam belongs to 90s art films, and should stay there.I do respect Collin revising the story to fit the movie format. It's a technical necessity.JLaw is strong and natural. Katniss portrayal is vivid. JLaw deserves all the fame and glory.Explaining a general confusion/ complaint:Why the kids gang up during the race - grouping-up is a 'natural' social behavior in Darwinian games. In (stupid) reality shows like Survivor, participants tend to pair up with the strongest possible to eliminate the weakest first, before final battles between the strongest. In THG, Rue is the hunted weakling. Katniss is also classified as a weakling because she is not a preemptive killer.Sociopaths or everyday narcissists need to win and to dominate at any cost. They tend to view kindness and compassion for fellow human beings as weakness. They have contempt for - and will eliminate such 'psychological weaklings' just for the ""gene pool weeding"" reason alone.The THG world has a mad, fascist-like ""Capital"". So within the story context, contestants ganging behavior made perfect sense.Is the world we live in as ""evil"" as that? Do incumbents gang up and scapegoat minority individuals, do wall street rich gang up to become richer, do powerful countries gang up on weak isolated countries?Some find the THG citizens' treatment of children gladiators as entertainment just too inhuman and unbelievable.Not long ago, ""fringe districts"" children and unarmed civilian women of our world were mass-sacrificed in the name of peace. The crimes against humanity still not acknowledged, justice still not done, after 70 years. Isn't that unbelievable?Are we still pinning all the blame and evils on a few scapegoat figures, so that we don't have to face the rot within?So the ""Capital"" citizens, the most powerful people on earth, their indifference and ignorance on the rest of the ""districts"", their choosing to not care about a few ""fringe scapegoats"", is very, very contemporary, and totally believable.For that timely theme alone, THG merited a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It was pretty good for me,"I've never read the original books before, and I enjoyed this movie. I had not expected that much about the movie... maybe that's why I found it fun during the running time. Still, I am satisfied with the movie and it makes me want to read books. I heard there are some people who argue that The Hunger Games actually stole the idea from Japanese literature and movie called Battle Royale. I am a huge fan of Battle Royale, and I also think the idea of 'killing' game is quite similar. However, it looks hard to say that The Hunger Games copied the idea of Battle Royale. People killing others in order to survive is a common theme in literary or media works, I guess. And The Hunger Games and Battle Royale are entirely different films.While watching this movie, I thought that the audiences from Panem are similar to people of the real world including myself. They are eager to watch more horrible and provocative things in media. It's getting worse in these days. Also, I felt that the world in the film is not that different from real. District 1, a strong one, already established the structured and well organized system to make its own weapon. In contrary, a weak District 12 cannot help but participate the games for living. And the Panem which takes control over the districts looks just hideous even though it is decorated with colorful stuff. I sympathized with the movie in terms of these points.Anyhow, I think the movie The Hunger Games is enjoyable enough. It is thrilling, and it's too terrible to imagine... I am waiting for the next series, and I'd like to read the books.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A huge disappointment, poor creation cheesy acting and no substance","Heard a lot of good things, but never got around watching it because the synopsis oozed cheesy teen game show adventure with a future reality. I eventually ran out movies and the day was here, so the cast was promising the costumes and environment quite the opposite. It tried to be so much more than it was, but unnaturally it clumsily exposed that a lack of imagination can not be covered up with high end budget graphics and awful costume design... I just couldn't digest it... if they would have somehow made it believable.... a possible uprising from the district's would have made a man out of all the wimps, white clothed police force and designer beard.. no thank you!

An overall exciting film that will entertain all ages even for its intended young adult audience.,"I decided to start my review career with this film. Ill give a short review that will hopefully add to the countless others.Having not read the book, i went in open minded to all and anything. Yes, i have seen Battle Royale. There are certainly some similarities, however i can say this is not a simple rehash of BR.Some of good things that stood out was the acting (Jennifer Lawrence i think it is did a superb job as the lead and i liked Woody Harrelsons portrayal of their mentor.) I am a big fan of dystopic society and thought the settings were well done. Futuristic in the Capitol and old, depressing, in the Districts.I have a few gripes. First, there is shaky camera a lot. Even when there is just calm convo, the camera moves like something really intense is happening. Gets annoying and makes it hard to observe the smaller details (ie set pieces, people). I also would've rather seen a little more brutality. I understand that it was pretty much restricted to PG-13 because of the target audience, however i think the brutish nature of the games and its contestants would have shown better if there was more....just more.Overall, Def a good movie. On a 100 scale, 77 does it justice. I am currently reading the book which explains some details i had questions about. Even if you have read the book, the movie will keep your interest.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Hunger GamesAny game that you have to play hungry is going to be a game with a lot of decapitations.And while this sci-fi film isn't about competing whilst hangry, it does have mounds of mutilations.As retribution for a failed revolt, the president (Donald Sutherland) of a dystopian capital selects two children from each district and has them compete against each to the death.Taking her sister's place in this year's games is Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence).Along with her male equivalent (Josh Hutcherson), Katniss must learn to listen to her trainer/previous winner (Woody Harrelson) and stylist (Lenny Kravitz) if she hopes to sway the superficial fans and survive.With a subversive script, an apt cast and an unconventional romance, this film adaptation of the teen-lit sensation has much more depth than others of its ilk.Incidentally, if Hunger Game officials are anything like their Olympic counterparts they can be bought.

Entertaining and Excellent but Will Be Overjudged,"The Hunger Games is actually the first movie that I've viewed after reading the book. As such I had mixed feelings going in, and my worry mainly pertained to event accuracy. I understand the nuances of making a movie and had I have donned the Directors cap I would've had to change parts to make it an acceptable movie for all crowds. However, this team executed the movie with a general focus on fact accuracy and the first hand experience.The acting in this movie is great. The actors all reacted in the manor i envisioned while reading. The production quality is top notch, which was expected for such a high profile movie. The level of accuracy that this movie has in paralleling the book is astounding from an adaptation stand point. It can be very difficult to make an entertaining movie that closely follows the structure of a book, but they were able to.I'd like to start out by saying that this is a great movie, but being that I read the book, I had some criticisms. The biggest one in the execution of subtleties. This movie tried very hard to define the dystopian world and spent a lot of the movie's ""free"" time on that. However, the visuals are enough that i felt this time may have been better spent expanding on the other characters in the movie. Emotions also took a back seat. Katniss is portrayed as a very strong emotional character, but a lot of the emotions around the various events felt rushed and lost.I would easily recommend this movie to everyone. However I don't think it will be as highly rated as it is successful. If anything I would recommend reading the book. Because I think if you wanted to make this movie you have it stray a little further and create its own identity. Trying to capture everything the book offered in just over 2 hours is an impossible task.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Dinner is Served,"This film is recommended.Our latest mega-blockbuster franchise was inspired from a 1987 sci-fi- film called The Running Man starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, loosely based on Stephen King's novel of the same name, which was inspired from Richard Connell's famous short story, The Most Dangerous Game, way back in 1924. Add in elements from The Wizard of Oz, The Truman Show, teen lit champ Twilight, and another classic American short story, Shirley Jackson's The Lottery, and you have The Hunger Games. No, there's no much originality left in Hollywood nowadays, but the money will be flying into the hands of the producers with this movie series. Hollywood still knows how to market and make an expensive film even more profitable and popular before its first screening.Money has been lavished on this big screen adaptation from Suzanne Collins best-selling trilogy, from its strong production crew to its fine casting. ( The author even helped to co- wrote the script, along with Billy Ray, and the director of the film, Gary Ross, giving it her seal of approval. ) The Hunger Games stars young up-and-coming talents who have proved their mettle in other movies: Jennifer Lawrence as the strong-willed heroine Katniss, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, her comrade-in-arms, and Liam Hemsworth as Gale. her best friend and confidant. Also bringing a modicum of class to this project, in showier supporting roles, are a perfectly smarmy Stanley Tucci (Caesar Flickerman), Elizabeth Banks (Effie Trinket), Wes Bentley (Seneca Crane), Woody Harrelson (Haymitch Abernathy) at his cynical best, and an underused Toby Jones (Claudius Templesmith).The simplistic story goes somewhat like this: It is the future. And, as we all know from past films of this genre, it's bleak. Global change is evident with drought, famine, and war the main causes. North America, now known as Panem, is made up of 12 districts where the 99% exist, and the Capitol, where the wealthy 1% live. Every year, there is a lottery where 24 teenagers from all the poorer districts, in teams of 2, are chosen to become part of a live reality game show like Survivor, only this time, it's real survival. One by one, these ""tributes"" are eliminated until the champion is crowned. It's Gladiator games with mandatory viewing, televised for all the citizens of Panem ( and us ) to see.What makes The Hunger Game fun to watch is that it successfully captures the satirical edge of present-day America's obscene fascination with reality shows and competitions, blending its sci-fi mentality and teenage romance angst with a relevant social message of our insatiable ""hunger"" for popular entertainment at all costs. Sure. it's an easy target to ridicule, but it works in an uncomplicated way.The story itself is pure action and only works on a visceral level. There is no true dramatic tug, no genuine emotion invested in the characters. Most of the teenage characters in peril do not resemble anything remotely real. They never go beyond the limitation of their stereotypical roles as pawns in the game of life vs. death ( the bloodthirsty jock, the mean girl, the innocent young waif, etc. ).Katniss, our noble protagonist, is portrayed as a young girl victimized by a cruel totalitarian society who sacrifices her own life to save her younger sister who was the actual Chosen One. She has all the heroic traits necessary to succeed: she's pretty and courageous, smart and strong-minded, agile and able to shoot a mean bow and arrow. Plus, she only kills in self- defense. A born leader and ultimate fighter, she's at the top at the food chain and the perfect role model for the tween set. Jennifer Lawrence shows the many sides of Katniss, all of her the spunk and savviness, and also subtly displaying her vulnerability and fear. Her casting is pivotal to the film's success in making Katniss such a sympathetic and likable character.Just as the tributes are manipulated by outside political forces, so is the movie audience controlled by its filmmakers. They have created a fine, if somewhat conventional, adaptation from an immensely popular novel. ( Loyal readers will not be disappointed in this version. ) Violence and gore are kept to a minimum to safeguard and assure that this PG-13 rated film reaches its targeted audience and the film is efficiently directed by Ross, although I wish he would have spent the extra $50 fora sturdy tripod to compensate for the overwrought shaky hand-held camera-work.The Hunger Games is diverting entertainment, a well-made film for assorted tastes, with enough satisfaction provided for mass consumption.

Watching it again on Tubi for the first time in years,"It seems to me to be far more relevant today after the past four years of political and social unrest. I think we all should take a lesson in how such a dystopian vision of a brutal future can become real. Other reviewers have complained about poor character development in the film compared to the novels. I found this almost universally to be true about movies. Think about it, if the movie was as long as it took the average reader to read the story in a book, then the movie goer would lose interest and walk away. Movies, out of necessity, are always basically summaries of the book.As for the storyline, this too is another expose on the battle between hope and fear. Hope of a better future versus a society that instills fear in the people in order to control the population. I envision Panem to be a allegory for the ancient Roman Empire, where the citizens of Tome were 'entertained' by the great gladiatorial games. A population properly entertained is one not susceptible to starting an insurrection that destroys a perfectly ordered society. Catniss and the other tributes are the gladiators. While those being entertained are the fat, dumb and happy citizens of Capital City live. The districts are the remote enclaves where everyone else on Panem toils in poverty and despair, resolved to their fate as lowly exploited peasants. Panem is a world where the masses, ruled by a few elites are held against their will within the ghettos.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Faithful to the book, and that's good!","With Harry Potter over (sadly), and The Twilight Saga coming to a close (thank goodness), America needed a brand new franchise to go crazy over. And here it is, The Hunger Games! A brilliant adaptation of Suzanne Collins' best-selling series (and far better-written than Stephanie Meyer's Twilight books). This movie delivers in almost every aspect. Despite its one flaw, The Hunger Games was definitely worth the wait.The one flaw I was talking about is the over-use of shaky-cam in a few scenes of the movie. It gets less abundant later in the movie, but it can be mildly distracting at times.But don't let the camera work ruin the movie for you! This movie is full of good things: superb acting, thrilling action, great story, and genuine heart. The movie was very well casted, with Katniss, Primrose, Gale, Peeta, Cinna, Effie, and Haymitch's characters all flawlessly portrayed by the actors. I also enjoyed the girl who played Rue: she was perfect! The action was very well choreographed (despite the iffy camera-work) and I felt as though I was experiencing the same thrill I did when I first read the book. I was on the edge of my seat, even though I knew exactly what was going to happen. I cared about all the characters.There were a couple of alterations in the movie's script that left out some details from the book, but it didn't ruin the story for me at all. There is no need to be worried about the movie screwing up the book; the changes are rather small and inconsequential.This movie is also very emotionally charged, just like the book. You can feel the characters' devastation, their happiness, their sadness, their defeats and triumphs. Again, thanks to the acting and the well-written script.Overall, this movie did a fantastic job of bringing the book to the big screen. It was enjoyable, exciting, and satisfying.

"Good film, but still socialist propaganda","Let me begin by saying that I saw the movie and enjoyed it. The premise was interesting and the characters (most of them) were compelling.I know people don't like to talk about messages in films. They want to just watch the film and be entertained; in much the same way they just want to pop a pill and never actually discuss their problems. We live in a consumption-oriented society, but we don't analyze what we're consuming. Talking about messages is important because you ARE influenced by what you watch (and read), whether you realize it or not.The underlying message of this film is extremely socialist, if not communist. The timing of its release is also very suspicious. Obama's entire campaign is based on the idea of the 1% (rich people) versus the 99% (the poor and starving). Interestingly enough, this is also (basically) the major underlying theme of this movie. This is a movie about CLASS WARFARE and socialist revolution. The actual premise could never happen in real life. The good guys are (of course) the poor and starving underclass; the bad guys are (of course) the evil rich class.The film is trying to draw attention to the importance of helping those who are starving - but no such people actually exist in the United States. There are people who are much less wealthy than others and there are people who are on welfare and food stamps - but there is NOBODY in the US who is starving to death. If you want to see that kind of poverty you should visit some of the war-torn parts of Africa. But even in these places, the people manage to survive.In any case, violence and social revolution are never the way to solve problems as complex as starvation and poverty, but that is exactly what this film is advocating (which you will see if you really take the time to analyze it).",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The book movie syndrome,"I wasn't really surprised after I watched the movie when I learned that it is actually based on the first of a trilogy of books. It felt that way.Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is quite entertaining, but there's missing a part. When a story takes place in a dystopic world I'd like to know more about that world because it is vital to understand the different characters and their motives. I obviously haven't read the books and from that perspective I found that the movie gave me very little information about the world's history. I think it wasn't even mentioned that there was a revolution during which district 13 was annihalated. I actually had to look that up on wikipedia. I know it's a difficult task to make a movie out of a book because you can only make a movie so long but I think there have been other movies which did this way better than Hunger Games (Harry Potter would come to my mind).To sum my impressions up: Good movie, but it could have been better if it focused a little less on everything around the hunger games and a little bit more on the people and the world they're living in because that's what the whole trilogy is about.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The plot, which I always say is the most important, was based on the popular series of books, was just OK. The heroes made it through, but there weren't any real unexpected twists and this movie wasn't dialogue heavy, it relied upon the action scenes. I would have liked to have seen more development of the story, however this does leaves room for a prequel. The acting was fine, and Jennifer Lawrence played a very convincing lead role which showed the strength and vulnerability of her character. I enjoyed the movie overall, but I won't watch it again.

Should not have been PG-13,"The Hunger Games wasn't as good as the book, but was still a decent movie. The roles were well cast and most of the acting was excellent.

If you're expecting to see intense action you will be disappointed: the film was censored to give it a PG-13 rating. Don't get me wrong, PG-13 movies can be great, but when the premise is 24 teenage gladiators fighting to the death, you can't make it PG-13 without detracting from the mood and thrills. Overall, I give this movie a 7/10 and would recommend watching it, but not before you read the book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Good and Very Rewatchable!,The Hunger Games is a very interesting battle Royale type movie. The idea of the Hunger Games happening is terrifying and this dystopian film captures it very well. The film makes you care about the characters and there is even some sad scenes. The film has pretty good cinematography and great acting and is quite rewatchable!,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
78 000 000 dollars of manure,"I was so bored at some points during this movie, that i started to play games on my phone.Its so predictable and clichéd that I don't even have to write any spoilers. You will figure the entire plot out at least 10min in advance throughout the whole movie.The story, illogical and dreadful. The acting, just painful. The special effects budget is spent on the wrong scenes and feels just wasted. The humor, none whatsoever even though it tries at some points.It is also very clear that they put a whole team of cultural marxists in charge of the production. You have the multicultural towns being oppressed by the white-only bad people. You have not one but three(!) hero black people, one with a sexy touch.It also fails as a love story since the main character gets emotionally gang banged.In summary: Painful.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
an above average SF flick,"The Hunger Games is a nice movie to watch, especially if you're into science fiction.The future world we see is in the movie is bleak.

Very good movie.,"Throughout all of the movies I have watched this one in particular is one of the most suspenseful and best end days/democracy ever filmed. It gives so much detail and is incomparable to most movies. This story is way ahead of its time, for being made in 2012 it's phenomenal. The perfect movement of the camera, amazing acting, and truely determined actors. The way Woody Harrelson treats Jennifer like his own daughter gives the wild situations in the movie hope for her to survive.

The fabulous battle royale,"1st review that I published but I really wanted to say why this film is GREAT !!! The Hunger Games, set in a future dystopian society where each year one boy and one girl from each district (there are twelve districts) must enter the hunger games. Each contestant must fight till the death in a huge arena, until only one left. The main character is Katniss Everdeen who shows strong character and sparks a light in the darkness, she has a leadership temperament, she is calm in all circumstances and she will evolve with the film which makes her very endearing. The Hunger Games is a movie with suspense and thrills as the hunger games is not the end. The plot is a broad idea with great actors and thrilling events. I recommend the movie to those seeking a movie that will have them on the edge of their seats. I have nothing else to say! Hats off to the director, adapting such a book so well is not easy, but never have I been so eager to see a sequel to this film! Personally, I love action and dystopian movies, so The Hunger Games is the type of movie that I enjoy a lot watching, and that's why I've already watched the saga 3 or 4 times. Every time, I feel the same emotions and I discover new details that make me enjoy this amazing saga more. But I still prefer books, which are much more detailed and which I have read several times as well. For me, it was not possible that the film adaptation would be as good as the novels, but that does not prevent it from being very entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but...,"I have to say I came late to this film and overall it was enjoyable. Jennifer Lawrence deserved the plaudits heaped on her and I was surprised to see Josh Hutchinson come out of it so well. I was not keen on the art direction as far as make up was concerned - the weird-shaped beard was impossible for anyone to maintain and the ""futuristic"" hairstyles just looked ridiculous. I liked the premise but for Jennifer's character to manage to survive without hardly killing anyone was a cop-out. Yes she caused a death and retaliated and killed someone but I think if she had gone after some of the other tributes then it would have been more realistic. It will be interesting to see how they make the sequel and what the jumping-off point may be. My main complaint about this film is the amount of hand-held camera-work. As someone else pointed out it is nauseating seen on the big screen - believe me it is the same on a home TV. A very unnecessary technique too much employed in a lot of modern films. It adds nothing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Battle Royale Lite,"Not comparing this to Battle Royale is impossible - the premise is too similar to be ignored. I'm extremely biased as well, considering Battle Royale is one of my all-time favorite films/books/graphic novels. So let's get this rant out of the way: The Hunger Games takes the concept of Battle Royale and waters it down to a product more accessible to a wider audience, specifically the younger crowd. My biggest problem with this is it loses the impact of Battle Royale - a frightening, beautiful, orgiastic display of shocking violence and social commentary. What makes it so twisted is that the contestants are all fellow students and friends, and we get to know many of the students, making their deaths more disturbing. In The Hunger Games, we follow two contestants and the rest are nameless, and with the exception of one young black girl, their deaths are meaningless (and mostly off-screen). The fact that the violence is so much more tame seems irresponsible - we don't see how horrific and terrifying it would be. The characters in The Hunger Games are black-and-white, good and evil with no grey areas, whereas the characters in Battle Royale feature heroes, antiheroes, complete monsters, and terrified teens. They're plunged into a situation and act like normal teens would, freaking out, committing suicide, going ax crazy, professing love, etc.As a film, The Hunger Games is certainly not bad - it's a well-made, well-acted spectacle that is entertaining albeit predictable. It takes its time getting to the action, but when the contestants are finally released it's thrilling (there's also a particularly intense scene involving a wasp's nest). It's probably the best we can expect from what a predictable Hollywood remake of Battle Royale would look like - significantly toned down, with a gorgeous cast, and a soundtrack featuring Taylor Swift, Maroon 5, and a couple good indie bands (as opposed to Battle Royale's classical music). I also like that The Hunger Games focuses more on the media aspect of the game, which was mostly ignored in Battle Royale. It's much less melodramatic than Battle Royale as well. The bizarre costume designs are great too.TL;DR - It all comes down to taste. If you prefer fantasy stories, don't like subtitles, and have no desire to see kids kill each other in over-the-top gory fashion, you'll like The Hunger Games. If you're a fan of horror, exploitation, or extreme Asian cinema, you'll like Battle Royale. I prefer the latter, but The Hunger Games could've been a lot worse.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Pretty good, could have been better","Things I liked:1) Josh Hutcherson played a great Peeta 2) Jennifer Lawrence also did great portraying Katniss 3) Anything that varied from the book plot was done very well, and should be considered an improvement 4) The movie is on the long side, but you wouldn't know it because it moved very quickly 5) Woody Harrelson and Wes Bentley were strongThings I disliked:1) Lenny Kravitz was very weak as Cinna. I thought he'd be great and he just wasn't. 2) Not enough time was devoted to many parts of the movie. It felt rushed, especially at important parts of the story (it'd be a spoiler if I said where) 3) Like #2, they tried to pack too much into the plot. It really could have used another half hour to be a little more thorough. 4) Cinematography was awful. Often the camera seemed out of focus from my view in the theater. Too many close-ups and the resolution just seemed off. Didn't look like HD. 5) Could have used more dialogue. Main characters barely spoke to one another. 6) Capitol scenes seemed very cheaply done and the editing was sloppy, as many have already said.I was mildly disappointed but the movie was still pretty good.

8/10,"The movie itself was great, having an excellent book to rely upon for the story.I also thought the direction was great. It was kind of artistic and somewhat detached, like a painting or a visual installment of a kind.My main and probably only problem was the miscasting of the main role. Surely it is difficult to find exact matches to the characters described in the books, but the heroine's small stature is essential to how she is perceived and perceives things and how she finally overcomes adversities. She is also supposedly coming from a starving background. So instead of getting a small in figure and thin actress, the producers cast a tall and rather bulky actress that looked well fed and not at all straggling and did not compensate this mismatch with her acting skills. The male leads, although different than how are being described in the books, are more consistent and functional.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Okay for the younger crowd,"I'm in my 50's and went to see the movie with my wife and 14yr old son yesterday (opening weekend). My son and wife enjoyed it, although there were no raves. Personally, I was disappointed and thought that the movie lacked intensity. This is likely due to the producers aiming for a very definitely younger teen crowd. I haven't read the book so can't comment on that aspect. The first third of the movie dragged for me and the latter part had no real surprises, with a storyline that left me with no real empathy for the characters.This movie will make a lot of money based purely from the effects of its marketing hype, but I can't see that continuing. I don't believe this movie will appeal to any male older than his mid-teen's. I'm not saying that this is a BAD movie, just that I think the premise could have been better explored in a darker, grittier, presentation with this future world detailed in more depth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I recommend this movie,"The Hunger Games movie is an action, dystopian movie that is very interesting . Based on a book by Suzanne Collins the movie takes place in a post apocalyptic world where the government makes children to fight to the death in an event that happens every year called the Hunger Games. The film's good guys are Katniss, played by Jennifer Lawrence, volunteers to take her sister's place in the games, and we follow her as she fights for survival and becomes the only glimpse of hope for the people who didn't make it in her district. The film does an great job of building tension and making you care about the characters and build a connection with them choosing which side you want to make it out, and the action parts of the movie are thrilling and very well made. One of the best parts of the movie are the people who are acting in it. Jennifer Lawrence is perfectly cast as Katniss, and other actors like Josh Hutcherson and Woody Harrelson do a great job at acting too. The film also shows the impressive production and the way the set was made, with the Capitol city and the Hunger Games arena both looking so real and honestly makes you feel like you're in the movie. Overall, The Hunger Games did a great job at making the movie and did a great job with the set and story line.

Since I'd like to watch the recent one from 2023 I thought it was time to give the whole series a re-watch and see if aged well. I'm glad to say it was as good as I remembered.

"The first half of the ""Hunger Games"" raises up the expectations: the second half let you down.","I start by saying that I haven't read the Collin's novel, but the underlying ideas in the movie seem to be quite grasping. The movies itself is not, though. The movie might be seen as an attempt to despise the reality TV shows, and it progressively succeeds doing so during the first half, but then is reduced to being not more than a bad parody of the Big Brother where the quality of the relationships are so inexplicable. Nothing is said about characters' motivations for their actions (which I guess has happened during the adaptation phase. There are extremely good guys and extremely bad guys.Adding more and more characters helps only to worsen the ambiguity, and the increases this gap between the two extremes.Dialogues are generally poorly written in a way that even in the most dramatic moments, you could only try not to laugh. If you can ignore these rather big issues, Hunger Game could only be an entertaining film to watch with your friends. especially that the story ends with an acceptable twist, making you interested in (perhaps) getting answers to the unanswered questions, though one thing for sure is that I won't watch the sequels in theater!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hunger Games Series,"I'm a big fan of the books and I think the films were an excellent adaptation. There are some changes but not enough to be bothersome.

Donald Sutherland is often forgotten but he's a natural for Snow. A wonderful series of the birth an unwilling leader.

Something Lacking,"I have no experience with this book series, so I went into the theater with only a cursory knowledge of what I was to see. Mostly from word of mouth and random commentary. This allowed me to view it as ""just another movie."" While I thought the premise interesting, I could never put aside the question as to why these events had evolved in this culture. I know the whole thing is a metaphor showing how media, left to its designs, could be the destruction of us. That said, I think that ""Rollerball"" used the same basic premise, the hero tilting at the oppressive gamesmen. Here we have the young woman, who in order to save a small child from certain death, finds herself in a fight for her own life. Everything is orchestrated as a TV show with smiling show host who have somehow managed to be put in positions of power. There is apparently a greater power which is never defined that has a stranglehold on the populace. Other than being chosen to be on the show, it isn't clear what their methods of control are. I guess they will starve them to death. Maybe they have weapons that could slaughter an entire population or something of this sort, but I never got the message. I thought the competition was also confusing. Why did the powers intervene at times? Was it just good television or did they have favorites? Maybe I'm dense, but I also had trouble understanding the point of some of the competitions. The acting is quite good and so are the special effects, and I didn't dislike the movie. I just felt that it left a lot of questions unanswered, and that most of the issues have been dealt with more effectively in previous films. A side-note: Other than their being visually interesting, is there any other reason for the wacky appearance of some of the characters who hold power. Are they like the people who dress up for NFL games in the most bizarre costumes, face paint in all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A well engaging treat based off the top selling novel by Suzanne Collins,"I read the book firsthand, then saw popular the motion picture. It was well visualized overall.

Speaking of the overall story, it was a very intriguing one that also included a neat vision of the future. The loved ones from District 12 shall hope to have their odds be ever in their favor. The story of course continues.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Saved by Jennifer Lawrence,"The Hunger Games benefits heavily from movie-by-marketing filmmaking, at least in terms of exposure. Sourced from a series of popular young adult novels by Suzanne Collins, the opening weekend is expected to make bank if not rewrite records.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has volunteered to take her sister's place in the upcoming Hunger Games, a state sanctioned gladiatorial event for kids ages 12-18. Presented as a TV show that keeps the 12 districts involved from uprising, Katniss is trained in both survival skills as well as presentation. Her mentors consist of Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), and most importantly Haymitch (Woody Harleson).Sadly there's at least a solid hour of buildup for a rather lackluster blood sport. Blame the PG- 13 rating if nothing else. The entire film is shot with a disproportionate shot selection. If you're into seeing the wrinkles on Elizabeth Banks, The Hunger Games is your movie. I haven't seen this many close-ups since Speed 2: Cruise Control. If the audience is seeing nothing but a blur of faces, they sure aren't seeing violence. Another thing they're not seeing is set decoration.As the story develops it becomes painfully obvious how this tale panders to the female psyche, resulting in a concoction that drives them to theatres. There's Katnis, the working class yet stylish heroine. She's talented with a bow and arrow, though I wonder how this futuristic society has overlooked the developments we have in compound bow technology. The men are cowardice. especially Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who is teemed with Katnis as her counterpart to represent District 12.In just the realm of cinema it's obvious there are two sources of inspiration. The gorific reality TV comes from The Running Man (1987). The kid vs. kid aspect is found in Battle Royale (2000). It's the latter that compares best. Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale is a tighter, more action packed, more dramatic, even funnier film. A classroom of children think they're going on a trip, but land on a deserted island with orders to kill each other. They watch a comical training video instead of sit through days of flashy interviews, chariot rides, and jungle gym exercise. The wildcards thrown in to keep the game progressing are truly fearsome and endless more probable than a computer program's summed canines. With each death in Battle Royale emotions pour out. We learn that everyone is connected, that some feelings need to come out, the value of friendship, and the price sustaining one's life. With The Hunger Games there are some bounds forged, buy the adventure puts them through few tests.The casting of Academy Award nominee Jennifer Lawrence does so much for the film that I wouldn't be shocked in the least if she didn't receive and Oscar nomination. You'll note how Kristen Stewart leads the fangirl series that is being unseeded, and that no one has ever considered her Bella Swan for anything other than a Razzie. If not for the eyes that speak without words of Lawrence, The Hunger Games would be a complete disaster. I can't stop you from seeing it but I'd like to encourage you to check in on the true source material, the aforementioned films.You can check out my (some would say comical) video review at my site VaughnOnMovies.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good adaptation,"Intro: I think this movie is a pretty good adaptation of the Hunger Games novel. I like the action in the arena.Plot: after an uprising, the powerful capitol puts on yearly ""Hunger Games"" where 2 tributes (1 male, one female) from each of the 12 districts fight to the death until one singular victor is crowned. Katniss Everdeen, from district 12 gets ready for the yearly reaping where the tributes are chosen, when her sister is reaped. In panic, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She now has to participate in the Hunger Games and hope she can survive.My take on the plot: the filmmakers did not change too much about the plot from the book to the movie. There are a few small storylines that are left out, but the movie is fine without.Characters: there are a few characters that I think are left out or just not named in the seam. Like Greasy Sae, who shows up but is only credited as ""Hob Vendor"". Lots of the roles are played very well. Some notable portrayals are Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss and Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. Jennifer Lawrence portrays Katniss as she is in the books, tough and guarded, not really knowing how to express feelings to anyone but her sister. Josh Hutcherson brings the complexity of Peeta, who is confident on the outside, but scared and lonely on the inside.Summary: This movie brings the depth to the characters the same way the book does, and has a fleshed out and easy to follow plot. I think this a good start to the Hunger Games movie series. Try it out, you'll enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hunger Games was a good representation of the Book. But may not have been a good movie by itself!,"I figured out what was wrong with ""The Hunger Games"", it was too much like the book, and not enough like a movie. the way books are written is different than the way movies are made. when a book is made into a movie it can't be directly ported, it needs to be adapted. when I watched ""The Hunger Games"" the movie didn't seem to flow. I think this is because they didn't adapt it from the books enough. you can't just film scene by scene from a book and and expect it to work in a movie, just because it worked for the book doesn't mean it's how it should be done on screen. when a book is written, the story is told but with a movie it is different because the story must be presented completely visually more or less. although the ""The Hunger Games"" portrayed all the Scenes from the book well, it did not feel the way the books felt. I give it props for being in line with the books, but certain things have to be different from a book in order to be a good film. it just didn't feel right. I'm not saying to cut scenes out I'm saying there is a better way of making the movie flow, that is different from the book. for a person who hasn't read the books, who doesn't understand everything thats going on, this movie might not seem very good, this is the fault of the movie makers.

"Not perfect, but good enough","I enjoyed how closely the film followed the book, there were some major things they left out, but still very well don compared to most movies that destroy the book they are made from. As a film , I was annoyed with the shakey camera, it could have been filmed better, but the over all film was good. I loved the actors they chose, other then Peta's character, he seemed to be useless in the film. Jennifer Lawrence did a great job with her part, bringing the essence of Katnass alive. The action sequence was great, the CGI not so good, especially the dogs. The movie gave a good look into a communist world, divided by wealth, how twisted society was and how one girl can bring hope and change for people to rise up against it. Perhaps the film didn't deserve all its hype, as it was a watered down version compared to the books, but in a sense it needed to be watered down to accommodate all audiences, not just adults.

Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don't know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. Some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. Other than that it is good popcorn entertainer.

"Though inspired, the fresh take is captivating!","After directing interesting movies like 'Pleasantville' and ""Seabiscuit', Gary Ross delves into the realm of Science Fiction quite efficiently and applies a unique touch. He himself adapts Suzanne Collins' first book in the Trilogy, along with writer Billy Ray and the author herself. Except the colourful costumes in a scene or two, the story is uniquely set in an aesthetic and gloomy environment, unlike the gloss, glam and colour of a typical Sci-Fi movie; Cinematographer Tom Stern lets the effect set in quite well.The whole satire on the concept of reality shows, set altogether at a completely different level, plays out in an intriguing way. Though it's mainly a story about violence, it's depicted without glorifying it at all.The acting by the two leads is strong and convincing, especially that of Jennifer Lawrence who portrays innocence quite efficiently. The supporting characters played by brilliant actors like Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci keep the story lively. Guest appearances by Lenny Kravitz and Donald Sutherland are also interesting.Overall, the story of this first part bears a lot of resemblance to the concept and story of 2000's Japanese movie 'Battle Royale', it's the setting, the direction style and the acting that keep this movie engrossing till the very end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Not the Blockbuster I Expected,"Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) voluntarily takes her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death in which two teenagers from each of the twelve Districts of Panem are chosen at random to compete.Although I have not read the books, I understood the general themes the story was about. There are the games themselves, which seem to have been heavily influenced or inspired by ""Battle Royale"". And then there is the political commentary on inequality -- whether this is a critique of Rome, America today or just this imaginary world is up to the viewer to decide.Jennifer Lawrence is great as usual, and it is nice to see Donald Sutherland in a small but important role. But overall I was actually a bit disappointed. For how hugely successful the books were, and how many people were excited for the movie, I did not find it to be anything really special.

"Entertaining, But Inconsistent","Enjoyable, no doubt. But obviously the depiction of the future was a little... inconsistent. The lifestyle of the people in the districts seemed like the 1850's, the clothes looked like the 1970's, a few aspects seemed futuristic, etc. So throughout the whole movie, I was confused in the temporal sense.Also, they stressed heavily on the idea that some would die of starvation, dehydration, and so on in the battle. But none did. Only one death was not caused by another participant. They also stressed heavily on the fact that getting sponsorship was important. But no scene explained why sponsorship affected the Hunger games. Only from reading the books afterwords was I able to know why sponsorship was so important.Although the movie had some flaws, it was very entertaining and didn't leave me bored for a second.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Near perfect adaption of the Suzanne Collins book,"The Hunger Games is an excellent film, it's not at all like Twilight and is absolutely not just for teenagers. The plot is as unique as it is interesting as it sounds and the casting for the roles was impeccable: Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, the severely underrated Josh Hutcherson as Peter, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch and the Donald Sutherland as the villainous and scheming President Snow.Cinematography was spot on, and the soundtrack is one of the best I've seen (or heard even) in recent years. The pacing to the film is great, being neither too slow nor too fast as such the audience doesn't get bored whilst we still get treated to plenty of story elements.9/10: Exciting, action packed and gritty. A perfect dystopian film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"On the whole the film is fairly predictable and tends to be quite slow in parts. Having not read the books, certain scenes seem unexplained and don't fit in the storyline. The major thing that ruined it for me was the incessant shaky camera and panning shots in particular throughout the early part of the movie. Why do directors want us to have the impression that the story is being filmed by someone with a camcorder? When projected onto the big screen this is both irritating and annoying and personally I find it very off putting. Weren't steadicams beyond the budget because too much was spent on hairstyles and costumes? The movie generally seemed a bit disappointing given the hype leading up to its release. I would only recommend it to someone if there was nothing better to see on the day they decide to go to the cinema.Negative Points: 1. Shaky Camera and over use of panning. 2. Overly long build up to the 'games' part of the story. 3. Predictable and a version of In Time meets Logan's Run, Gladiator and Running Man. 4.Story not even logical, (why on earth would a young girl of about 10 be entered into a gladiator style tournament against a 20 year old man?) 5. Poor casting. 6. Bad ending (obviously Hollywood preparing for Hunger Games II). 7 It's 2 hours and 22 minutes long.Plus Points None that I can think of but it might encourage more people to read the book instead.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An Adaptation That Delivers,"There's hardly been a film I've seen in the past couple years that's been more anticipated than The Hunger Games. The beloved trilogy of novels has been in the works for the cinema for several years now and if you couldn't judge by the number of tickets in pre-sale, then just go online and search for the legions of fans eagerly awaiting this adaptation. With that said, this would have been an easy film to mess up. We've seen it with Twilight and Percy Jackson. Luckily, THG is more Harry Potter and less Twilight.For the uninitiated, The Hunger Games takes place in a futuristic America renamed Panem, where The Capitol is home to the rich and powerful and lords over the 12 outer lying districts of Panem. Because of past transgressions, each of the districts is forced to give up a male and female between 12 and 18 to fight to the death in the titular Hunger Games.Where THG could have gone wrong, it mostly gets things right. The pacing is relentless, the characters are well acted, Katniss is a very strong heroine, and the film doesn't shy away from places it could. But let's delve into some of these. First, for fans, have no fear, this is the movie you'd hoped for. All of the truly important elements are translated well here, from the downplaying of the romantic angles to the action being brutal and justifying the source material. As a fan of the book myself, I am happy to say I was pleased. Of course, the soul of this is Jennifer Lawrence, who does Katniss justice. At times a strong, brave leader, and at others vulnerable, this is the kind of role model that should be painted in these films. In another review, she was compared to the main character of Twilight, and it's a just comparison. Katniss is a very well balanced human, done even better as embodied by Lawrence, who channels some of her academy-nominated role from Winter's Bone here. To call her inspired as the choice for Katniss is an understatement. Watching her, you'd think this was the role she was born to play.The rest of the cast fares well, though they seem to come and go in flashes. Josh Hutchinson is great as Peeta, standing his ground opposite Lawrence in a part that is almost equally as well played. The bigger stars here do their roles justice and are suitably entertaining, with Elizabeth Banks as Effie and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch both stealing some of the show in their respective parts, which both add some humor to the film. Donald Sutherland also stands out, as he usually does, as the devious President Snow. He's a suitable villain and one that is actually expanded upon from the book, which is nice.The pacing is a bit of a double edged sword. The film does a good job of not lingering on anything. There's little melodrama here, and that makes for a good, fast paced, exciting film. At the same time, the film moves at such a pace, and provides us with so much info, there is rarely time to catch your breath. Even the early parts are so filled with information and detail, that you feel as though they don't quite reach the emotional peak you'd hope they would. We do get glimpses here and there, and it helps that Lawrence has such great range in here role that she gets the right emotions out. But it also feels as though characters are rushed through. Haymitch never quite comes across as the emotionally damaged character he should be, instead coming across as the necessary mentor/teacher figure. That isn't to say Harrelson plays him down, because he still does a great job. But the character just feels like it never quite goes to the places you might hope he would.However, the quibbles with the film are minor. It is, again, an exciting movie that translates well. The futuristic America designed by Suzanne Collins is fantastically realized and the games themselves are every bit as exciting as you'd hope. Fans won't be disappointed, and if you're not a fan, this movie should be a good way to turn you into one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
eager for catching fire,"Read all the books. I know the story by heart. Been waiting for the movie for months. Im proud to be one of the first people to see it. The Best 2hrs and 22mins of my cinema life. The subtle changes from book to movie were acceptable. How i pictured it in my mind while reading it, Gary Ross brought it to life. All the actors were amazing- they carried out the characters like its really who they are. They were not acting, they're living someone's life like its their own. One name that stood out- KATNISS.

(Battle) Royale with cheese...and a side order of over exaggeration.,"So as a movie enthusiast and a Cineworld unlimited card holder i do my fair share of visits to the cinema. Of course when a film garners interest the trailers become more and more prominent; this could be said for the newly released ""Hunger Games:Catching Fire"". Constant trailers and advertisements on TV....which led me to think...well i haven't even seen the first one yet. This led me to take up the opportunity that CineWorld had put before me, in seeing the first film in the Cinema in a one day special showing of the 2012 blockbuster...........but oh how i wish i didn't. Fast Forward to the end of the film and i walk out wondering what all the fuss is about and ahead of me i see an ever growing queue outside of anxious teens awaiting the midnight showing of the sequel. And it hit me like a bullet. This is why there is so much hype. I mean there could be no better an example of teen power than the Twilight saga. And this is very similar. Has any of these nutters seen ""Battle Royale""? That is how you do a film focused on individual survival. That is a film that shows you the depths people will go to survive. It doesn't hide from the violence and it doesn't over complicate it. It is live or die. Simple.Now this farce of a film is more focused on creating a love triangle between Katnis, (Lawrence) Gale (Hemsworth) and Peeta (Hutcherson). All this district nonsense, all this sacrifice, all the deaths...just for a love triangle. That is what the underlying story and forthcoming films are going to be all about; twilight anyone? It is one of the cheesiest films ever; made me cringe so much i was almost sure my spine would snap at any moment. That my head would go all exorcist and just keep going when i constantly turned away in dismay. This film is successful because of the vast amount of teens who are vacuumed into love stories and won't let go until a shirt is taken off. And anyone over the age of 18 who still enjoys this needs to grow up and go watch Battle Royale and that'll show you what would really happen in a circumstance like this.The film takes almost an hour to start and when it does start, it actually doesn't. It's slow, uneventful and the characters they try so hard for you to feel sympathy towards are so incredibly unimportant that you simply don't care.Yet another film, that is over exaggerated, over hyped, over advertised and over the top with cheese.2/10 (and that's me being nice)",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome!,"A great ride of a movie that captures Suzanne Collins' brilliant novel. It is a great science fiction picture because of its pacing, cast, and portrayal of a nation that governs its people through fear and fascism. The movie shows a society that has collapsed. While the average person fights for survival, the top class and government can basically do whatever they want. Included in this is a barbaric cultural show, The Hunger Games a bit like Celebrity Jungle mixed with American Idol, but the losers die. It makes you feel emotion for every person who is on the ""good"" side, and creates an atmosphere unlike anything you have ever seen. Jennifer Lawrence is totally awesome. Emotion runs on high through the movie and I was on the edge of my seat the entire way through. I'm glad I watched it and I can't wait to see the sequels, second and third Hunger Games.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The odds were in their favor,"Set in either an alternate reality or a time perhaps not far from our own, the world is run by the dictatorial and futuristic Capitol, the rich and powerful(whose appearances border on the grotesque, with make-up, sharp colors and clothing choices) ruling over the twelve districts, from all of which, each year, two teenagers, one of each gender, must participate in the titular competition, these 2 dozen kids fighting to the death. This is both great as an adaptation of the book(which, for those who haven't read it, is pretty good, not brilliant), and as a movie(almost everything in this makes sense even if you haven't read it, you can enjoy this whether you're familiar with that or not). Going from a first person perspective written work to a visual medium requires decisions made; inner monologues that explain things are made into spoken lines, and they here show things that Katniss(Young Mystique Jennifer Lawrence, who is evidently sticking with her young, determined independent female disguise... to be fair, she wears it extremely well, so why mess with it), our lead, does not see or experience. This does mean breaking up staying with the wilderness, the hostile environment(that is not as deadly or dangerous in this as in the source material), once the Hunger Games begin. That, by the way, doesn't happen for about half of this(similar to the novel), giving room for development, plot and setup(the contest is massively built up, and it really pays off). The vital characters are present and matter; Caesar, you love from when you see him, Cato is vicious, Cinna is very sympathetic, etc. This has phenomenal acting, by pretty much everyone involved. Unlike his daughter(X-Men: First Class), Kravitz is convincing. With the talents of Wes Bentley(see? This is how you use him, not the emo crap in Ghost Rider) and Donald Sutherland, we have faces put to the totalitarianism behind it. It really gets to you, and arouses emotion. One bit could easily have been sappy, and instead, it is just rather tragic. This is quite well-edited and filmed nicely. One thing on that, however... and this is why I wouldn't label this an action flick(drama-thriller, more like)... those sequences, the fights and such, are disorienting, and they shouldn't be. Why is it chaotic when two people are wrestling? Shaky cam and close-ups, please, just... no. The wish-fulfillment is present(young girl who doesn't know how to be, just coming into her adolescence, suddenly adored, going from poverty to expensive, delicious food being thrown at her(and no weight gain!), love triangle(which they do disservice to) from her having no boyfriend...), if less obnoxious. FX are excellent. This works as a satire of reality television, and goes into different themes than Battle Royale(that's about growing up and going out into the merciless world, this is about brutality as entertainment) There is a little blood, violence and disturbing content in this, as much as they could fit in without losing the PG-13, and they choose the right times to put it in, so it's effective as can be. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise, and anyone intrigued by the concept. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"An engaging adaptation that ends up becoming the victim of very poor directing, camerawork, and color grading. This film could have been so much more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jennifer Lawrence is the Girl on Fire!,"""We wish you Happy Hunger Games! May the odds be ever in your favor. "" The Hunger Games have begun and the odds are definitely in director Gary Ross's favor as he has managed to adapt Suzanne Collins's bestselling novel really well to the big screen. Ross has delivered a highly entertaining post apocalyptic, sci-fi, action, romantic thriller. Most fans will be satisfied with this film because it is truly entertaining and has a little bit of everything for those people who are looking for action, or for those who are more interested in the romantic story, and so on. It also has a great cast and the lead performance from Jennifer Lawrence is just brilliant. She captures the ideal female heroine who we all want to root for. She is truly the girl on fire. It comes as no surprise since Lawrence blew us all away with her performance in a small independent film called Winter's Bone. She has already turned into a true star and proves she can have a lead role in what looks to be a very successful trilogy. The rest of the cast is also pretty interesting as you have great actors like Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Toby Jones, and Donald Sutherland, along with young talented actors like Liam Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, and Alexander Ludwig. They've really done justice to the characters that were created by Collins, and I can't forget to mention Lenny Kravitz who was also excellent as Cinna. As good as all these actors were, Jennifer Lawrence was above par and she really delivered the story and brought a lot of heart to her character. A great deal of the success this movie is having can be owed to her remarkable performance as Katniss.Suzanne Collins has created a very creative new futuristic world with some common elements from the past. The United States doesn't exist as a country anymore, but it is divided into twelve districts which are all controlled by the Capitol. The name of the country is Panem, and the further away the districts are from the Capitol the poorer its people. The wealthiest families live in the Capitol and in order to control the districts and avoid another uprising they have created the Hunger Games, which consists of selecting two teenagers (one male and another female) from each district and have the 24 teens face off one another until only one survivor remains. They force the entire nation to watch these games and it has become a popular sporting event, kind of like the Roman Empire did with the gladiators, except that the arena is much bigger as they have the wilderness to hide in. This serves as a reminder of what happens when the districts rebel against their capitol and at the same time it keeps the districts fighting amongst themselves so they won't form any alliances to try to begin a revolution. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) lives in the 12th District along with her little sister and mother. She is a hunter and is excellent with the arch. Her best friend is Gale (Liam Hemsworth). When the elections for the 74th Hunger Games take place, Katniss's younger sister is selected, but she takes her place instead as a tribute. The other member selected from the 12th District is Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who is very strong and has a secret crush on Katniss. Together they must face the rest of the tributes with the help of their trainer, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), the sole Hunger Game winner from their district in its 74 year history. The favorites are always the tributes from the first two districts because they have been raised all their lives to be prepared for these games. Cato (Alexander Ludwig) from the 1st District and who is sadistic in nature is their biggest threat.Once the Hunger Games begin the audience is immediately submersed into the story and Katniss's struggle for survivor. The story is really well told and there are plenty of thrills and suspense for the audience to enjoy. The two and a half hour long movie has such a quick pace that by the end it will seem like you were only in there for an hour. The games are really that interesting and have you at the edge of your seat for almost the entire movie. I really enjoyed the pacing of this film along with the performances. It is hard to get a lot of character development with a movie that has so many things going on and that focuses almost entirely on Katniss, but we really do grow to care for several of these characters that have to face off each other. Of course there is no time to really know all 24 of them, because the story centers on Katniss and Peeta. There is sort of a love triangle going on, but the film really doesn't delve in too deep with it. We will probably have more of that in the upcoming sequels, but most of the scenes involving Katniss don't have to be spelled out for us. She delivers such a great performance that we can hear what she's saying without ever having to say anything. We can read what she's saying through her eyes alone. When I heard about the story I thought this was going to be a violent film, but it really doesn't focus on the violence as much as it does on surviving. I really enjoyed every second of this film and it is my favorite film of the year so far.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
good movie but not for kids,"Basically this movie should be rated R and be longer to include more things from the book.A poor attempt to take a rated R movie and give a a PG-13 rating to make money.

All I have to say is OMGosh,"Back in 2009 I picked up the first book of the ""Hunger Games."" I read half of it and had to return it back to the library right when it was getting good. I haven't read the rest of it since. But seeing it this Saturday makes me so upset with myself that I didn't go back to read the rest of this book. This movie was incredibly amazing!!! The actors were great and I wasn't bored at all. The only thing that made me tense was wondering when they were going to get to the battlefield ha-ha! In the beginning they're getting prepared for this horrific fight to the death for so long that I thought the movie would end right when it was time for them to battle each other.

"A bit trite, but they try","Another take off on Battle Royale here, the fight to the death, ten little Indians with one or two survivors thing.It doesn't matter why they do it in these spectacles, because obviously there can be no justification for such a ""game"".It's pretty mundane to say ""killing is bad"", because those of us who think the ""kill"" mentality of games is immature and sick, those who are the beaver and butt heads who get off on it will get off on these kind of movies just as much, unless they are shown for what they are, and the characters are shown for what they are.That's why Battle Royale worked so well, and why The Condemned failed, because the Condemned was simply a neo Nazi propaganda movie for the sick human demons of society.This one works fairly well, although we get lost in a bit of drag, mostly due to confusing camera work, and due to drawing out scenes too much.Plus, the idea has been run into the ground. This movie really offers little new.The maniac played by Sutherland is without motivation, but honestly, he is a grown up beaver and butt head. We have seen many people who worship the lack of motivation, and they are now adults in positions of power, the same nerds and geeks who praised their own inept superiority in their virtual worlds.So the maniac ruler works well in this, and is believable.

Since I know it was filmed by the book can feel that the good parts of the novel stripped. So, what we see is very good. Drawback is that (as usual) the first part of the movie still have many gaps and areas that would be much better look that the film is divided into two parts and take at least 3 hours.

A despicable concept,"Battle Royale but with children and teens because hey... Violence sells and adults being forced to kill each other is so overdone!Who ever thought this was a great concept for a YA novel has a sick mind, whoever thought of bringing it to the big screen is probably even worse. If the concept itself isn't despicable enough (but can somewhat get a pass because the greater the evil, the bigger the hero who brings it down), it's the tone that's particularly distasteful. Instead of naturally frightened young people who were forcefully thorn from their families and what they know and thrown into a nightmare, it all feels like your everyday high school or summer camp rivalry, complete with the token mean girls and best buddies... because it's not like they're fighting for their lives against absolutely everyone else. The off camera deaths and lack of blood is truly what makes this whole concept so awful, it lightens and makes it feel like a harmless game what is truly ugly. Go on, show children and teens being shot, cut, poisoned on screen and let's see the uproar because of how that's inappropriate! Instead, we get this, the same concept, but without the blood and suddenly it's ok and appropriate for teens! What's wrong with people?Nothing to say about the cinematography or acting. They're good enough.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"At last, a first class adaptation of a first class book.","I have always thought that The Hunger Games was a very good book with a lean and powerful way of conveying the plot. The film has a lean and powerful way with showing this. Going beyond strict adherence to the book it translates the story into a cracking cinema experience. The director got first class performances out of his cast, his vision of the books was spot on and I really did not notice the 'shaky-cam' camera work. I also have to commend the wardrobe dept, the fashions of the Capitol were truly bizarre and Katniss and Peeta's 'Fire Costumes' were just right. I in fact thought the red interview dress was better than the one described in the book. The killings in the arena were brutal and tragic. The death of Rue was just as heart wrenching as the book and I thought Jennifer Lawrence wonderfully conveyed her dilemma over her feelings or Peeta. I also really enjoyed Josh Hutcherson's portrayal of Peeta. He was great in a very difficult role to pull off well. On re-reading some of the reviews I find it so amazing that some people are still trying to say that Collins 'ripped-off' an obscure Japanese film that was never released in the US till after this film was in the cinemas. I just find it so difficult to believe that she 'stole' ideas from a film that never played in her country. It's just so hard to steal ideas that you don't know were made, and did the fact that Takami seems to have 'stolen' his idea for 'Battle Royale' book from a previously published book called 'The Knights of the Forty Islands' count as a rip-off' as well?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The odds are in favour of the first must-see film of the year,"After months of endless hype and speculation, The Hunger Games are finally upon us. With fan anticipation running high, I managed to check out the Canadian premiere of the film a few days early. And I must say, I came out significantly more impressed than I ever imagined.Set in an unspecified future, one boy and one girl are randomly selected as tributes from each of the ""Districts"" that make up the country known as Panem to take part in The Hunger Games – a televised battle to the death. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) of District 12 volunteers in place of her younger sister to take part in the games. But survival will not come easy, especially when she faces 23 other individuals.I will confess, I initially thought The Hunger Games would be nothing more than a dolled up, Americanized version of the absolutely brilliant Battle Royale. Thankfully, it was everything but that. For Gary Ross has helped create a film that goes above and beyond a simple adaptation. This is a living, breathing, full blown phenomenon just waiting to break out. He hits the ground running after a brief explanation of the titular games, and makes the film more and more interesting as it trucks along. I hate that I will compare this film to Harry Potter and Twilight so often, but it does so much right that the first films in these franchises did wrong that you begin to wonder whether it is because of the source material, or because they just found the right filmmaker from the on-set to bring this epic story to life.Lawrence, an Oscar-nominee for Winter's Bone, proves her worth and undeniable talent as Katniss. She carries the film on her shoulders from the moment she enters the frame, and never looks back. You feel every breath, every tear, every ounce of struggle she goes through. We already knew she was an exceptional talent before, now we know she is a star and this was the role she was born to play. She is very in tune with this character, and never wavers; staying strong from beginning to end. While the young cast of Harry Potter and Twilight took 2-3 films to really find themselves, Lawrence already knows who this character is and how to play it. Granted she stays focused through the next two films, this could go down as one of the best character portrayals in film history. Whether she is on her own or interacting with the rest of the cast, you simply cannot take your eyes off her.Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, the other half of District 12, does a fairly good job supporting Lawrence. There is a lot left unsaid about his character (although significantly more than Liam Hemsworth's Gale, who spends all too much of his screen time brooding and looking longingly into the distance), but he is more than up to the task of showing off the skills he has been praying would make him a star for the better part of the decade. He does a lot of the emotional lifting in the film, giving his best work to date. He even helps make the more love-centric aspects of the story not feel nearly as dragged out as they seem to be.While the young leads are all great, I found myself most fascinated by the supporting cast of adult character actors like Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Wes Bentley, and especially Stanley Tucci. All of them are sadly underused, but are all incredible additions when they do pop on screen. I just wish it was more often.But what holds The Hunger Games back from perfection is its distinct lack of flavor or personality. The film moves at a wildly chaotic pace, barely slowing down for character or story development. It just moves from beat to beat, to the point where you can sense the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. And in this chaos, you never get a sense of what style Ross wants to infuse the film with. It has all the elements it needs to be a dystopian masterpiece or even a poignant and subtle social satire (ideas I already know will be developed in the future films), but it never quite gels together the way it should. It thrills you, but at the same time leaves you incredibly empty. I am not sure if this is how the book reads, or even if this was Ross' intention. Is he holding back on purpose, or is someone pulling strings to make sure the film does not truly become its own thing?I feel like I may be getting to the point of nitpicking (I will leave out my reservations about how shoddy some of the shots involving fire looked), but days later, I still feel like the film is missing that one crucial element that separates it from being a simply book-to-film adaptation and the truly wonderful epic it should rightfully be.While it may not be perfect, I cannot help but applaud The Hunger Games. This is the best first book-to-film adaptation since The Fellowship of the Ring, and did exactly what I secretly hoped it would – made me want to read the books as fast as humanly possible to find out what happens next. While it hints at oh so much of more, the film gives you just enough to stay riveting throughout. Lawrence cements her status as someone to watch out for, while Hutcherson and Hemsworth should brace for stardom. With Harry Potter an all but distant memory, and Twilight hopefully fading into obscurity, it's nice to know we have a series we can actually look forward to continuing.

decent,"This wasn't too bad an adaptation of the book. True, the book was richer. Which did you like better, the movie or the book? Books are usually better. This movie was a little more violent than it needed to be, and it conveyed the book's idea well. Basically, it was a dystopian future and their watching their version of reality TV. North America was divided into various sanctions, and people were chosen to do battle with each other until one person was left alive. LAST PERSON STANDING!

May the Odds Be Ever in Your Favor. And they certainly are!,"The odds are definitely in The Hunger Games favor in terms of box office and reception. I am a huge fan of the book and when I heard about the movie I just got excited as anyone could possibly get. Of course I still had some doubt. Every time I heard someone say it would be the ""next Twilight"" my heart would drop because Twilight is by far not anywhere close to the standard set by The Hunger Games. However, I went into the movie with an open mind and was absolutely blown away.The cast that were chosen for the film was perfect. Jennifer Lawrence played Katniss with exceptional strength and even grace that made me completely buy her as being Katniss and could not imagine anyone else as the strong heroine. Woody Harrelson portrayed Haymitch with a respect for the character in terms of how the character truly feels about the Capitol and showing him as a man made bitter by his life, which in my opinion was pretty much what Haymitch was. And Donald Sutherland as the vicious President Snow was absolutely terrifying in the role. He brought on the same aura of malice and hatred that the character was easily able to create in the books. This is just the first movie and I cannot wait to see what else he brings to the table in future installments. Now I could go on and on about how superb the cast was because it is true. Everyone brought something great to the table but it was Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss that held the movie very high up. The action and violence was also pretty gruesome and done just right so that it didn't go overboard but was faithful enough to the book that the violence wasn't undermined. The outcome of having Suzanne Collins (author of The Hunger Games) work with director Gary Ross to write the script for the film version was probably one of the best things to happen for this film. It is superb filmmaking at it's finest.In closing, The Hunger Games is a faithful film adaptation to a great book that is superbly written, performed, and directed to create what will probably be one of the best films of the year. The action and suspense will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the film as well as surprise those of you who have read the books. This film is about two-and-a-half hours long but the pacing matches that of the book so that when it's over you'll feel like its only been an hour-and-a-half. It never drags on but is always on the move to something more exciting than the one before. This film will stay with you for years to come and will make you think a little more about what direction our society is going in.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nothing like the books,"I would highly recommend reading the books first, but this film adaption is worth seeing. Many emotional scenes and tiny fine details along the way that all come together - it does not have the sci-fi ""tendency"" of being predictable. Maybe a lack of character growth. You want to watch the next movies in this trilogy after this",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The odds would always be in favor of Hunger Games,"Being a phenomenon among teens and tweens can guarantee your box office success, no matter how bad is your production. But to guarantee you increase beyond your target audience you need to smart up. Where Twilight sets the bar, you expect others to follow suit. You hire bunch of good looking dudes & girls (who happen to be extremely talented) and dumb them down until you think they are just sticks in good looking clothes. But little did we know, some of them were taking notes of the mistakes Twilight series committed and made sure there movie version of another book phenomenon does not make the audiences roll their eyes over and over again.How good was Hunger Games can be measured by the audience reaction to the anticipated scene they had read in the book and yet gasp on every scene that struck a chord by its penchant melodrama between all the bloodshed. Truth to be told, the bloodshed was minimal in the movie version compared to all the gory details of each death in the book. This was still a packaged product to attract young to very young audience and would not expect 'Battle Royale' kind of gore. But the movie still packs a punch amid all the melodrama.Even if you are not interested in the teen love triangle being played out, you would find the politics interesting. It's pretty amusing how the pundits from Left and right of American political spectrum came to the conclusion that the movie justifies their political stand against one another. All in all, an entertaining movie that provided something for everyone to enjoy. That said the success does make the maker's task easier and provides a loyal audience for its following sequels. One hopes they do not just concentrate on marketing and focus on keeping the quality of their product consistently good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Although it stayed with its flawed points, ""The Hunger Games"" is still completely decent.""","An attempt to switch ""The Hunger Games"" into ""Katniss Everdeen"" would be very lame. You couldn't think of the film without thinking of Katniss; and too you can't imagine Katniss without having a fixed thought on the movie either. The two artistic creations are impossibly separable from each other, just like United States of America and her idea on democracy. I think it is fair to purchase an opinion that ""The Hunger Games"" series starts on a high note. The first instalment of an ambitious 4-movies series is far from being weak or ineffective. Although it stayed with its flawed points, ""The Hunger Games"" is still completely decent.Set in a dystopian future in the nation of Panem. Panem is likely to be located in North America of today's world-map; to match with an imagination of an empire that covers the lands of Canada and USA, or probably Mexico too. The nation consists of a wealthy state named Capitol, and 12 poorer states which are just being called as District 1, District 2, District 3and District 12. Every year, as a punishment, one male and one female from the age of 12 to 18 will be selected from each district to participate in the Hunger Games, where the players will fight to the death in an arena, and the sole survivor will be the victor. In the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) reluctantly volunteered to replace her sister to be the female tribute (female participant) for District 12, as her undying love for her family overcomes her self-ego that possibly contains her. Her choice on not saving her sister from the Games was actually not an option at all.Gary Ross's vision on Panem is very close to what my personal discovery on the modern society or humanity would be like; or at least, a tease. In the poorer states, which are the 12 Districts, the people are being dressed in a very natural, humane-style. But on the other hand, the wealthy people in the Capitol are very eccentric looking, or simply an image of absurd investments by them to provide paths for ugliness. My view on the mentioned points would be related to people in general who are merely slaves to anything that is modern or 'fashionable'. The rich from the Capitol are likely belong to that group of people, as they are easily exposed to and influenced by the outside world; whereas the poor from the 12 districts have less exposure to anything that would lightly bring destruction upon them.""The Hunger Games"" too was pointing out on the righteous humans- sensitivity that is slowly draining out from us; perhaps the assumptions are false, but undeniably the facts do stay in the characters of the story. The sense on it withered; the slightest acts to consider on containing a person's heart are buying less. It is too dense, it is relentless. I am in reluctance to indicate the scenes which would unveil the assertions that I made, but one of the moments would probably be on the humiliation that Katniss faced by the wealthy when she is merely trying to fairly display her capability to prepare herself for the games. Their brains are dead, and sensibility is long-gone.The performances are responsible for setting it apart from other ordinary teenage-dream movies. Many big-budgeted over-hyped young adult fiction pictures are absolute failure, but thankfully, 'Games' is pleasant. Jennifer Lawrence is terrific, Woody Harrelson is terrific, Elizabeth Banks is terrific and Stanley Tucci is terrific. The characters' personas, on either side, are so well captured by terrific stars. Great thanks to the talented cast, which occupied personal-charms in its own level.'Games' hits on frustration through its self-obsessed editing and the overused employment of shaky hand-held. Gary Ross sure has his own idea or reasons on the practice, but it never gets me. My animosity for the vision is not deep, but the touch of admiration that I would have for it is not a success either. Firstly, the work on shaky camera gives a pain in the head. Secondly, especially during the earlier parts of the film where The Reaping Is taking place, have failed to establish a connection between me and the poor in the state (District 12). Therefore, personal emotions that should have been carried out to audiences, are not reaching.The characters are flat out dumb and laughable at times. It aims at the forgettable bad guys specifically, who act on not wanting to be humans, but to behave in accordance with an unfavourable writing that even a horror is mistaken for a comedy. Peeta Mellark? He is one of the worst characters to have ever appeared on screen. It is a weakness when a dumb and insulting character is overshadowed by a far more superior heroine. Take Peeta out, and the movie would fare better.""The Hunger Games"" is one of the few films that really bite me. I am not referring to its characters, but the reflections that were being addressed. The voices are essential, but only in my thoughts, hinged from my personal experiences. I firmly believe that ""The Hunger Games"", as a whole, is a tragedy. It gets to a stage where leadership completely devours its society, and with support, it stands with hypocrisy so terrible that it lies with a talent of only causing pain. A very powerful fiction though.Score: 2/4(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Future of American Cinema?,"I'm a big science fiction fan of both movies and literature and usually give the science fiction genre a fairly wide berth. But in the case of 'The Hunger Games' I feel the need to thoroughly pummel the film because of its lack of originality, weak character development, and abundance of predictability. What do I think of 'The Hunger Games'? In a nutshell, think 'Twilight' with a science fiction spin. I'll elaborate on that point a little later.First let's talk about the total lack of originality. A strikingly similar premise was penned by Japanese author Koushun Takami in novel called 'Battle Royale' which was published in 1999. For those of you who don't read much – probably all the same folks who just love this movie - look for the same title on IMDb as it was adapted to film in 2000.At first glance I was thinking 'Battle Royale' rip-off all the way, but the more I thought about it, the more another author kept creeping into my gray matterthat author is Stephen King. He wrote a couple of short stories along the same lines. 'The Running Man' in 1982, and 'The Long Walk' in 1979. Heck, you can even throw in pieces of 'Cujo', published by King in 1981. I won't spoil the film for you, but you'll get the 'Cujo' reference if you feel the need to waste your money on a viewing of 'The Hunger Games'. If you're going to write science fiction or make a science fiction film, you need to weave a story that is somehow original. 'The Hunger Games' seems to have pulled elements from various King novellas. So, in my mind 'The Hunger Games' gets a big fat 'F' for originality. Enough said! I'm not even going to mention the fact that the filmmakers must have run short of money because it appears as if they borrowed the wardrobe from 'The Fifth Element' for the ritzy city dwellers. WhoopsI just mentioned it.Let's move on to the 'Twilight' referenceOK, you know how in 'Twilight' the only Werewolf and Vamp in town both happen to be in love with Bella? Well, here we go reduxthe only two stud muffins - in the supposedly poor hamlet of Katniss (the heroine), both are in love with said female. So what about hunger? Those boys were both built and corn fed. And that's another problem with the moviewhere are the hungry people? Lol Not only that, but the character development was so weak I felt nothing when folks started to die off.I could go on and on about the holes in this film but I'll stop here. It's enough that's it's not original, lacks in character development, and is as predictable as the lingering smog in L.A. I'm giving this film 1 star – which may be a tad harsh – but I feel the need to counter all the salivating teen girls that evidently love this film as much as little chipmunks love packing goodies in their cheeks. If this is the future of American cinema we're in big trouble folks! Let the chipmunk's rule?I hope not.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Believable!,"I would classify myself as a major fan of the books. So of course I noticed all the subtle differences between the movie and the book. However, I'm smart enough to understand that books and movies are in two different mediums, and thus cannot be compared to one another. I'm allowed to say the movie was a great adaptation on the book, which it was, but you have to judge the book with one review and the movie with another review. That is the end of my little rant, now it's time to review the movie.I thought Gary Ross did an incredible job taking a difficult storyline and piecing it together without losing all the brutal and cruel elements of the story.What I liked:+ The tone throughout the movie matched the tone of the characters. Too many times we see dramatic action movies try to add comedic elements to lighten the mood and add some comic relief, which I believe takes away from the ""mood"" out of movie. The Hunger Games kept a consistent dark tone from beginning to end.+ All the actors were terrific and more importantly ""believable"" special shout out to Jennifer Lawrence, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, and Woody Harrelson. I have never seen a movie where I felt so connected with the characters and beating to the pulse of Katniss and Peeta.+ The camera-work! I know some people may not like the hand-held camera shooting, but I think it gives the viewer a first-person view and I'm going to throw out the word again ""believable""+ The underlying Score! Music isn't featured as much in the Hunger Games as it is in most movies, but when it appeared, it added to that dark tone that I loved so much. Kudos to James Newton Howard.What I didn't like - There weren't too many things I didn't like about the movie. Actually there is only one thing, I wish they showed more of the districts and capitol citizens reactions to the Hunger Games. It wasn't a huge deal for me but it's something that could have added to how cruel the sport is and what the citizens are thinking when there loved ones die.Overall, I give this movie an A+. I don't give many movies A+ but this movie is well- deserving of an A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Did Not Love it,Did Not Hate it","I didn't read the book and therefore had no idea what the movie was about. After reading a few reviews,I decided to give the movie a chance. Firstly,I found it much too long. For the first hour and a half,I felt like I was watching American Idol,or America/Canada's Got Talent. I could just see Ryan Seacrest up there as MC before the games began. It was so predictable at that point,even boring. Also,the people in this dystopia looked very weird and not believable. When the games started,I was getting very dizzy with the shaky camera work. I imagine this was to give it a PG rating so as not to show too realistically any of the teens killing each other. It was just touched upon,not that I would want to see too much violence either. When the Hunger Games were in full swing,I really kept thinking of the reality TV show,""Survivor."" There were a few inane twists at the end but all in all,I never felt fully immersed in the movie.For the last hour,I kept looking at the time.This doesn't take away from the great performances by Jennifer Lawrence,Woody Harelsen,or Donald Sutherland. All in all,I wasn't moved by this movie. What were the reasons for the present state of affairs in the future North America.And show us some depth in the main characters. Forty years ago,in 1972,I saw a very intense movie about a future dystopia,""Soylent Green,"" with Charleton Heston and Edward G. Robinson. I have never forgotten it. We saw people starving,begging for food,etc. There was deep emotion and you could identify with the characters. This was not the case for me watching The Hunger Games. By tomorrow,I will have forgotten most of the movie. Wait for it on DVD is my advice or go on a day when rates are reduced.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Most Dangerous Game,The chase has been with us as long as celluloid; and this particular storyline dates back at least as far as 'The Most Dangerous Game' eighty years earlier; which clocked in at just 63 minutes. Since then several 'Star Trek' episodes have used the basic situation and a teenaged element had recently been contributed by 'Battle Royale'. The costumes of the affluent seem to have been inspired by Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' (while Woody Harrelson appears to have have been given a makeover by the same hairdresser and beautician as Klaus Kinski on 'For a Few Dollars More').Set against an incongruously serene woodland backdrop; the constant use throughout of whip pans and wobbly steadicam photography already looks as dated as the excessive use of zooms during the early seventies now does.

loved the fire dress,"Learned that this, of all movies, is the first, the very first, movie, since mid-Seventies with THE EXORCIST, that box- office super über-success was achieved with a only a female headlining the cast. Now that was like waving a red flag in front of a bull. You've gotta be wrong, it cannot be. PRETTY WOMAN, I wanted to yell out almost instantly, but that one is Richard as well as Julia.But this sports thing is the big moneymaker, the big people's choice is this film with the waver-thin plot? There are so many holes in the plot, you could idly coast a Zeppelin through it. But this is the big name? I kept thinking of BAYWATCH. This might be without the beach, and the bikinis, but it's an activity show, with too little characterization, and a weak storyline that serves as an excuse to get on with what it is all about: mortal combat presented as televised sport. All the time we do not really get into the head of the main character, we mainly see her reacting. The movie is thus far more empty than you lot will ever realize. Everything of it is geared to the sequel, with many plot threads hanging loose, clearly they knew it was going to be hellishly popular, so let us do it this way. But why? Why? It isn't really that good, it's very basic, yeah, that's what I am trying to say. A winner it is not, it lacks a whole lot of finishing touches.I am not just critical. I am not knocking it. I am saying THAT FOR ITS REPUTATION I EXPECTED THERE'D BE MORE THAN THIS.I loved the fire dress, as impossible a notion as it is.Noticed all those close-ups. Movie is filled with close-ups.

Losing Means Death,"Losing means death while victory means fortune and fame. That's exactly what The Hunger Games is about. The Hunger Games is a pg-13 movie with the genres, thriller, Action film, Adventure film, and Dystopian. The Hunger Games is produced by Gary Ross and John Kilik. However, this movie is based on the book version, written by Suzanne Collins. With the majority of people loving the movie (84 rotten tomatoes), there are still some others who hate it ""WORST MOVIE EVER. IT's TOO LONG(Drew McWeeny)"". Here are some reasons why viewers would love The Hunger Games.
In the movie, The Hunger Games, there are a lot of reasons why viewers love this movie. The first reason why viewers would watch this movie is that of the cover. Since most of the heroes in movies are mainly male, people were in love when they saw a woman on the cover. After watching the movie, viewers would love to watch the next film or even the same one because of the amount of detail the movie gave the viewers about each character, and how much the people got to know the characters individually to find out how relatable they are to people today. Another reason why the viewers would watch the second movie is that of how action-packed the film is. At one point of the movie, there are fight scenes, and then the next is a romantic scene. ""This movie is really for everyone. They added a bit of everyone's taste(Katie Lees)"".
Even though The Hunger Games may seem like the best movie ever created, some of the viewers hated it ""I came into the theater thinking it was going to be the best film. However, it was not! (Savannah Macbeth)."" Reasons, why people wouldn't like to watch this movie ever again, is because it is over 2 hours. Since people today are so busy, no one has the time to watch a 2+ hour movie, and if it is above 2 hours, it's normally going to get the audience bored. Another reason why people hate this movie is because ""This movie places us a post-apocalyptic world, though is no sign of how the end came and no trace of toxic aftermath(David Thomas)."" To put that into words, viewers do not like this movie because it makes no sense whatsoever, and the setting is off.
In conclusion, The Hunger Games is a great movie to watch if you love action-packed films and love a movie that will keep you on your feet. However, if you have children under the age of thirteen, watch movies way too seriously, and have no time on your hands, this movie is not for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I think everyone should go see the hunger games because it is absolutely amazing! the camera is not fast passed, in only one scene is it moving fast, the reason being is because the characters are in a part of the film which entails running.

"A Loyal, But Shallow, Interpretation","Surprisingly grim, gray and bleak considering the target audience, this is as close to dystopian as PG-13 gets. An inordinate amount of time is invested in world building and scene setting here, which makes for some great, functional locales, but also relegates the plot to secondary status. Jennifer Lawrence is well-cast as the brooding, bow-wielding introvert Katniss, but the rest of the cast underperforms - especially Woody Harrelson, in a role he was seemingly perfect for, as her pathetic, booze-drenched adviser Haymitch. Readers with a fresh memory of the novels will get the most out of this interpretation, which assumes its audience knows most of the finer points of what's going on and summarily neglects any form of deeper investigation. It's gorgeous, though occasionally a bit too eccentric (some scenes in the capital look like they were ripped right out of a Final Fantasy cutscene) and non-fanatics will probably find it too narrow and fluffy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Fair Adaptation of the Book,"I watched the movie, read the book and watched the movie again in that very order. Probably not the best approach, but no big deal right? Not exactly.I thought the movie was good when I first saw it, not great, but good. After reading the book the movie was diminished a bit but still good. Hunger Games did a fairly good job adhering to the book. There were some changes, but I could see that the majority of the changes had to do with time constraints more than anything else. To stay completely true to the book the movie would have had to be four hours long or so. After reading the book I found myself being overly critical and longing for certain scenes to be more detailed. I was looking to capture the same emotions I had when reading the book.As movies go, this is a nice dystopic film. The tale is not over the top with heroism but rather subtle heroics. The action is moderate and enough to keep the movie lively.

The Excessive Closeup Games,"I was excited to see this film based on all the hype from my friends. I haven't read the books, but thought the story was interesting based on the one-line explanations I got from others.I went into this film expecting to see something similar to the Twilight films (teen obsession over book turned film), but better.What I got was much, much worse.First off, I want to say that I thought the acting was great. The actors did a great job of portraying their characters.What WASN'T so great was the lack of character development. The death scenes, even those meant to be emotional, didn't affect me at all. I am one who isn't afraid to cry like a baby at a movie, and I often do. But while the others around me were sobbing, I was just ready for the scene to be over with.Another reason I strongly disliked this film, has to do with my title. It seems like 95% of the shots in this movie were closeup on the characters faces. These are fine, to an extent, but you begin to wonder after a while if the actors aren't all just bodiless floating heads. The fight scenes were quickly cut together, which could work, if you weren't zoomed in so much that you have no idea what was going on.For a film with a supposed 100,000,000 dollar budget, this came across as a low-budget independent adaption of the book. They could have done so much more to improve the visual aspect of the film as well as make the characters more likable.Overall, I would give this film 4 stars, mainly due to the great acting and costume design. Everything else, was horrible.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great adaptation, intense, and suspenseful. It delivers well for its book fans.","I read the Hunger Games a few years back and instantly became hooked on the series. When I heard there was going to be a movie, I felt super excited and also worried because as we all know, most of the time it comes out crappy (for example: Golden Compass *sigh* so much potential).In this case, the movie came out great --- for an adaptation. Probably one of the best book to movie results I've seen so far. For those who have never read the book, it'll come off as action-filled and exciting (and not just another 'sexy-hollywood-mtv-teen-movie' bull). For those who read the book, it'll be more than satisfactory considering a lot of the dialogue and scenes are the same as the book, seeing as it wouldn't need editing for movie-sake. There are some subtle changes, but nothing to make you rebel against them.Cast is good. Lawrence plays a great Katniss: strong, awkward, but holds lots of presence. They're Peeta however didn't make me giddy like the book version did. Gale is Gale, all angry and bitter. And so on.The style of the movie is awesome, love the shaky cam and the minor score/soundtrack bits. But the shaky cam does get a little out of hand to make sense of what's going on in some action scenes. Note: I didn't see one Mockingjay though, which was weird.All in all, I'd definitely see it again, buy it on DVD, and then watch it some more. I am a book fan so I will say that it could have been better, longer if anything.

Entrance to a promising trilogy,"Okay, just got back from The Hunger Games. I rather liked the movie. I'm not going to talk about the actors. No one made glaring mistakes and I haven't read the books, so can't compare. I'm going to discuss the movie style a bit, then the story itself.The handling of the camera and the general cinematography aspect was rather ""fashionable"". The shaking during the action and the lots of close-ups are all the rage nowadays. The shaking was a bit overdone. Especially in the beginning. Luckily a bit later it calmed down, because it sometimes makes me nauseous. The close-ups were good, just the right amount at the right moments. Especially because it wasn't 3D. You can't do so many close-ups in 3D nor shake the camera, because the mind can't keep up.The story was good. I knew to expect a dystopia. As a genre they are usually defined as portraying the worst of all possible worlds. They are also usually critiques of the present society. I could see that very well. I have to constantly change the channel from the various idiotic reality shows that are mostly just porn and a bunch of people pretending so that they can be the most popular. Of course, in The Hunger Games it's their lives at stake. In dystopias, that is usually the case.Katniss is the archetypal protagonist of dystopias. She's the kind of person who is playing along to survive under awful and impossible circumstances. She is generally a good person, someone who doesn't subscribe to the popular culture. However, the fate of these people is to have their lives changed in a way that they can no longer sit idly by and have to go against the establishment. We could already see that towards the end of the movie and I'm assuming in the following two that is going to be the theme. The only thing I'm wondering about is whether the author followed the genre to the end. The sad thing about dystopias is that the protagonist inevitably fails. The odds are just too great against them. I'm curious to see the story to the end.All-in-all, I did enjoy the movie from an intellectual standpoint. I do have to admit that I like dystopias as a whole, so that was my bias.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fantastic film that should not simply be dismissed.,"As someone who dislikes following the general populace, I was extremely put off from seeing The Hunger Games. I had never been a fan of books that were turned into movies and found that the biggest turn off from a movie is a huge cult like following. I eventually bit my tongue and went to see it with one of my best friends, expecting a mediocre film that was decent enough, but not worth a second watch. I have to say that after I watched it I knew I was very wrong.As someone who did not read the book, I went in completely blind. I knew the general idea of the story and that was enough to at least fill in the small parts that the movie misses, which is unavoidable. What I thought would be another Twilight ended up being alternate world with oppression and triumph as some of the main ideas of the film. I feel like everything fit together perfectly and had all of the characteristics needed of a great movie.Unfortunately, some people did not enjoy it as much as I did because they already read the books and were unhappy of certain parts being left out or felt that they were too high and mighty to watch something that many others were fawning over, as I had been before, to watch a movie and enjoy it for what it is and they really missed out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A review from a guy who had no idea about Hunger Games novel,"The Hunger Games is more of Drama/Romantic Genre than of Action or Sci-Fi.So don't expect kill Bill or Star wars out of it.It has more similarity to Twilight.But one thing I have to say its way better than those twilight movies.Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen is the soul of this movie and her chemistry with both Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark) and Liam Hemsworth (Gale) is quite believable.Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutherland were excellent in their roles as Haymitch and President Coriolanus Snow respectively.I wanted more screen time for Amandla Stenberg(Rue).I found Rue and Katniss's relationship rushed.As I had no idea about the novels prior to watching this movie, I was not familiar with the plot or characters.But it didn't matter as the movie's plot was interesting and its pace was brisk.Females will like this movie more than males.I found even though this movie didn't live up to its High(Very High indeed) Hype,But still its good enough.After watching Hunger Games I am looking forward to watch the sequels to know what happens next.But If you are a twilight Hater and don't like romantic movies,then better catch some other movie or go to watch Hunger Games with your girlfriend as Your Girlfriend Will Love It.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hunger Games,"The first one was great! I loved the whole movie. How they led up to the plot and how it ended was perfect because i knew that the series are coming out.

A mediocre idea that could have been made into a good film - but this is not it.,"A mediocre idea that could have been made into a good film - but this is not it.Watching 'Hunger Games'. Pity about the Apple-loops excuse for music. Nice to have it all so predictable - perfect watching for Alzheimer's patients.What a horrifying film, though, far, far, in the future and humanity hasn't evolved beyond 'reality' plebvision....Isn't it fortunate that, as Yogi Berra pointed out, 'It's difficult to make predictions, particularly about the future'.Pathetic, really. They don't even know what 'star crossed' means. How sad, they could have made an interesting film, instead of this tosh.I thought, for a while, that it might be anti-fascism, instead it was a bad modern re-make of 'Triumph of the Will'. Yankland Über alles in der Welt'.Well, I suppose that you have to accept that it reflects the Zeitgeist. I think that Neitzche, if shorn of all his aesthetic sensibilities, might have liked it.What is worst about the whole thing, really, is that such a badly made, fascist film is so popular - if it had just gone straight to DVD, where it belongs, it wouldn't be such a sad indictment on popular taste and popular sentiment (sentimentality, really).I suppose that we have to accept that, like the depression in the 1930s, this depression has, almost inevitably, led to an adoption of fascist mawkishness. Wouldn't it be nice if humanity was capable of something better.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
HG Movie-Book Comparison,"Suzanne Collins sold 200,000 copies of her book, The Hunger Games after one year of publishing. The box office sold over $200 million in tickets in the first week of the movie release. Did the movie really deserve the millions of views it got? The Hunger Games is about a game in which 2 tributes from each of the 12 districts compete in a game to the death. When Katniss volunteers for her sister as tribute, she tells about her feelings and the process of being a tribute in the Hunger Games, emotionally and physically. The Hunger Games movie is far less powerful than the Hunger Games book because it didn't give deep detail about the personalities, events, and emotions of the characters.The Hunger Games movie doesn't show the Character's personalities as in depth in the book. From chapter 15-18, the book talks about Rue and her relationship with Katniss. Particularly on pg. 208 when Katniss says, ""Rue has decided to trust me whole heartedly. I know this because as soon as the anthem finishes, she snuggles up against me and falls asleep. Nor do I have any misgivings about her, as I take no particular precautions."" The movie doesn't show Rue's relationship with Katniss, which makes it seem that Katniss was exaggerating when Rue died. This evidence proves that the movie is far less powerful and interesting in comparison to the book because of the deep connection between the characters that we are able to witness. In chapter 2, Katniss talks about her Dad and how he died in a coal mining accident. On pg. 26, Katniss says, ""My father had been killed in the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest January anyone could remember. The numbness of his loss had passed, and the pain would hit me out of nowhere, doubling me over, racking my body with sobs."" She also explains how her mother ""shut down"" which left her the responsibility to feed and take care of her family. This describes Katniss and how she came to be a great hunter and resilient young woman. The movie scarcely mentions her dad at all, which makes Katniss's personality seem different from what it truly is. This evidence proves that the movie is far less powerful and interesting because Katniss's life is interesting, and if you leave out a big part of her life, she isn't as interesting. Chapter 1 explains Gale and his personality and relationship with Katniss. On page 6, Katniss says, ""In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be myself. Gale."" This shows how Gale and Katniss are close, and not just strangers. The movie shows short scenes of Gale which makes him seem different from what he is really like. The movie makes the book seem far less powerful. This evidence proves that the movie is far less powerful and interesting because without the personalities of the Character's, the story would be confusing and dull.The Hunger Games movie fails to include crucial events that happened in the book. One example can be found on pg. 49 when Katniss throws away the cookies that she received as a parting gift from Peeta's dad. She says she doesn't want them to fool her by being nice so Peeta can plan a strategy to kill her in the arena. The book doesn't show this scene, and doesn't really show anything about Katniss thinking that Peeta is a threat to her. This proves that the movie fails to include crucial events that happened in the book. Another example that proves that the movie fails to include crucial events can be found on pg. 38 when Katniss gets the Mockingjay pin from Madge. She later thinks about her friendship with Madge in the arena which gives her hope and pushes her to keep going and not give up, unlike the movie. The movie doesn't include Madge at all, which proves that the movie is far less interesting than the book because the crucial detail is very important in the story line. The final example can be found on pg. 168-171 when Katniss almost dies from dehydration. When she is in this situation, she thinks about Haymitch and if he really cared about her enough to send her some water so she wouldn't die. On page 170 when Katniss says, ""I have misjudged Haymitch. He has no intention of helping me at all."" In the movie, Katniss gets water immediately. She doesn't have to ponder about Haymitch and if he really cared enough about her to save her. This event was very important in my eyes, which proves that the movie is far less powerful than the book due to the fact that it failed to include crucial events.Although the Hunger Games movie was nothing in comparison to the book, it was a fun, action-packed, and interesting movie. I would recommend that you see the movie, but I also recommend that you read the book. The Hunger Games movie was far less powerful compared to the book because it didn't include some of the characters' personalities, crucial events, and Katniss's emotions. The book was more engaging and interesting because of its deep detail, so I STRONGLY believe the Hunger Games movie is far less powerful than the Hunger Games book. I can confidently say the Hunger Games movie was far less powerful than the book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Review from a guy who has not read the book,"HUNGER GAMES REVIEW:The movie that all of the teenagers have been waiting for. The next BIG franchise to fill the gap that Harry Potter has left in Hollywood (and Twilight...thank God that's almost over). Does it live up to the hype? In short...it's a solid movie....but not the greatest movie ever made.The acting was pretty good, and you can really tell that a lot of thought, time effort and money went into the making this book a realistic world (for the most part). People complain that its slow for the first 40 minutes, but honestly that's called character development. It was laying down the plot, telling us everything we needed to know to comprehend the rest of the movie...and did a nice job of keeping it interesting.As a whole, the movie was well made, the actors did their parts well, the story was interesting, and it did a good job of making us care about the characters, and drawing out certain emotions when necessary. My only complaint is that the camera was way too shaky during action sequences (as if the camera man was trying to survive as well). I'm happy to say that this is a ""teenage book franchise based movie"" that isn't a pain to watch. Looking forward to the second one. 8.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

About The Hunger Games,"The Hunger Games is a futuristic movie like its book. Firstly, I read the book, and then I went to the cinema. When I watched the movie, I actually disappointed. Because the book is better than the movie to me, but it doesn't mean that I didn't like the movie. I like the movie, surely, but I just have so much expectations. I think actors and actresses who are chosen are right. While I read the book, I imagined characters like people who played at the movie. Especially, Josh Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence are suitable to my imagination, and I'm glad about that. For its subject is so interesting, millions of people loved the movie like me. While I watched the movie, I was impressed. Because Katniss Everdeen struggled to survive, and she chose to go to Capitol for the Hunger Games. She was so close to death, but she just thought her sister, and surely there is a love story at the movie, but it is little bit complicated. Because she didn't realize her love to Peeta, but Peeta fell in love with Katniss. It also is interesting thing at the movie for me. All in all, I look forward to the Catching Fire. I read the book, too. I'm excited about it, and I expect so much things, too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Post apocalyptic Sci-fi screen adaptation,"Overall,best movie in years.Best for those who have read book.Written in first person the novel is an easy read though more graphic and as disturbing to any parent of teenage or tween children than the film but very little is left out.The editing is clipped and hand held camera unsteady at start of film with many shots less than.5-.25 s but it slows down once the tributes are selected and the effects are worked in seamlessly as the characters arrive at the capital.Hopefully the point of the film,it's message against violence,oppression,racism and economic inequality is not lost on the bulk of those viewing it.

On top of all I've read somewhere that this movie was basically some Japanese movie called ""Battle Royale"" remake. In conclusion, don't watch this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Absolute Triumph.,"As a pop culture junkie, I have been waiting for this film for a very long time. Just like that other big YA series about dead people and really hairy men, I had never even heard of ""The Hunger Games"" until they started discussing the movie. But the hype certainly peaked my curiosity, strengthened by the casting of Oscar-nominated Jennifer Lawrence in the title role. Yep, March 23rd was reserved a long time ago for ""Hunger Games."" Due to the absolutely incredible response and pre-sales of tickets, seeing it on opening weekend didn't happen, but the few days of delay hardly hurt. With phenomenal reviews and most considering this one of the best book-to-screen adaptations in recent history, the monumental, record-breaking $155 million box office take over the weekend just flamed the roaring fire of anticipation.And yes, unlike most other films with this much hype, ""The Hunger Games"" is one of those rare films that should have been buried under it but instead, not simply rises above, but easily surpasses all possible expectation.We all know the general story of it being about a bunch of kids thrown into a televised reality show which pits them against each other to the death as a way of repenting for the war-like sins of their forefathers. However, it is not an exploitative film about kids killing each other, but rather an absolutely thrilling film about class, survival and the basic good and evil of people.Jennifer Lawrence proves that her Oscar-nominated performance in 2010's ""Winter's Bone"" was not a fluke. Playing Katniss with an absolutely even perfection of awkwardness, shyness, remorse and bitterness, she turned a potentially very unlikeable character into someone we can all relate to, whether you're the thirteen year old girl who devoured the books...or a thirty-seven year old man who had never even heard of them. She is, in a word, captivating.But not only does Lawrence shine. In a role that could have just been a waste of a cute guy, the extremely cute Josh Hutcherson (""The Kids are All Right"") as Peeta proves he has far more to offer than just an extremely handsome face but some real acting chops to boot. In a much more minor role, but still incredibly memorable, Liam Hemsworth is just a feast for the eyes as Gale Hawthorn as is the incredibly delicious Alexander Ludwig as the evil Cato.Lest we forget the adults in the film, all of which are played by outstanding actors in their own right, and every single one of them at the top of their game. Stanley Tucci reigns as the host of The Hunger Games, Elizabeth Banks shines as Effie Trinket, Donald Sutherland is statuesque as the president, and in a completely surprising left-of-centre role, Woody Harrelson continues to dominate the screen as mentor Haymich Abernathy. Not to mention, I don't think Lenny Kravitz has ever looked so handsome as he is playing Cinna.All this to say ""The Hunger Games"" is an absolute thrill ride from start to finish. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it enraptured me completely. Are there aspects I wish I understood a little bit better from reading the book? Sure...but that's why one has literate friends. There are mild imperfections, but all are easily forgiven by otherwise strong storytelling, excellent direction, perfect performances, incredible costume design and art direction and astounding cinematography and effects.""The Hunger Games"" was like watching the merging of ""Survivor,"" ""Lost,"" ""American Idol,"" ""Big Brother,"" ""The Truman Show"" and the Academy Awards into one spectacular event. The mere grandeur of the film leaves me confused as to how anyone could walk away even remotely unimpressed when the execution is perfection.Certainly one of the best films I have seen in a long time, the easily the best """"hype"" film since ""Avatar,"" ""The Hunger Games"" has easily left me starving for more. When ""Catching Fire"" comes out next year, you can bet I'll be getting my tickets real early.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A slow and frustrating film that is held together by its strong and capable cast,"Because of all the hype surrounding The Hunger Games (Dir. Gary Ross, 2012) I presumed it was going to be heavily entertaining and enjoyable. But on the contrary, it was slow and frustrating. I found little empathy for any of the characters and struggled to understand what should have been a very simple plot that somehow became more and more complex as the film dragged on.I will firstly point out that I have not read the books and so I went into the film with only the understanding that The Hunger Games focuses on a yearly event where children end up fighting other children to survive. By the end of the film I discovered that The Hunger Games was essentially a desensitised Hollywood adaptation of Battle Royale (Dir. Kinji Fukasaku, 2000) with a greater back story. Also because The Hunger Games is based on the first in a series of books I was able to tell that nothing bad would happen to the protagonist, which perhaps helps in the films slow narrative progression.The Hunger Games rushes the beginning plot in order to reach the games, and therefore a lot of the story is lost. This rushed first hour forces a sense of mild confusion onto the spectator, as we are unsure of the significance of multiple characters and symbols that only fans can relate too. The camera-work of the opening twenty minutes before Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is swept away to the capitol is fantastic. The uncomfortable camera angles followed by quick cuts or jump cuts create a sense of fear and uneasiness. This same effect is used when the games finally get underway to emphasise the violence that is taking place, without focus on the blood and gore. However the games also drag on for another hour. Many of the scenes within this section feel overextended and a few of them unneeded. Surprisingly, in the last twenty minutes of the film it increases pace and enjoyment before rushing through the final few scenes, in order to reach the two hour mark.For an expensive and high grossing blockbuster one would expect the CGI to be believable and realistic, which in majority they are. But in one scene in particular where Katniss and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are arriving on chariot into the capitol, they are both wearing suits that are supposedly on fire. Whether it is the audience superimposed onto the green screen behind them, or the fire that doesn't even look like fire, this scene was sickening to watch in what was otherwise a beautiful and creative film.Acting-wise, Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks exceeded my expectations as they provided a surrogate mother and father, to an extent, for Katniss and Peeta. The characters presented in The Hunger Games are all very different as they have individual traits. Unfortunately because of these differences there is almost no attachment created between the audience and the characters, except perhaps Katniss as she is the protagonist. However due to her cold nature and bland facial expressions Katniss is also not entirely relatable to.When a film mentions its own title almost every minute it is never a good sign and The Hunger Games was no exception. The lack initiative or common sense used by the majority of the characters throughout the games is heavily frustrating – look out for the tree scene or a scene with Rue (Amandla Stenberg). Many characters are introduced and then forgotten, which can only be preparation for a sequel, a flaw that The Lord of the Rings trilogy managed to avoid. All in all The Hunger Games was an enjoyable watch with many avoidable flaws. Perhaps its sequel will be more entertaininghttp://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Really good! but if you get a headache easily, do not watch.","I am a fan of the hunger games, so i was really excited to see this movie. It did match the book in the best it could possibly do, that was the best part, there was a couple changes, but understandable why they were changed. The camera work however is another story, it was not very stable at all. Very shaky work, and some of the focusing on closeups were very fast and not very good. But other than that i did enjoy the movie. Another thing is if you are Obsessed with the book, like i mean read it like 5 times and no everything down to the last button, you are not in for a very good trip to the movies. Because you know way to much about the book and are expecting the best of the best, but the movie is NEVER the EXACT same as the book, the little details that they changed are going to make you mad.

An adaption that boats a lot of good action,"The Hunger Games is a survival film based on a book and which I think was well adapted to boot. With some truly thrilling sequences and acting from up and coming stars, the film oozes teen movie, But I do think generally that anyone can and will enjoy this. It's starts a series off well and you can already tell by the time you finish it that this is the start of something good. I felt it was solidly a good film, and here is why so.The story starts very slow and you may think ""Oh wow this is going to be dull"", but it then really gets into a groove. The pace starts to go along nicely and we are introduced to new and big things that provide an entertaining end. It probably is good to say that the film really gets going when they actually start to really do things(basically enter the game itself), yes the story goes well with such things going on and the movie really isn't afraid to shock the viewer, very entertaining though.I found Jennifer Lawrence here to, well she didn't actually seem at her best at times but she does what is asked of her, provides a strong lead character. Josh Hutcherson also provides a good supporting character and his role is very un heroic but of course it works in parts and really brings out the potential the man has. Donald Sutherland is only seen little but you remember his face quite a bit, same goes for Woody Harrelson and both stand out mostly because of there resume in film.Gary Ross directs this and well, with books yes they already have a script but I think he was able to add things in maybe for dramatic purposes and his sure hand of directing stabilises the movie in it's more slow parts. I wasn't a massive fan of some the effects on show such as the city and natural effects seen but I guess we aren't supposed to focus on them, and with the a bigger budget maybe they could have been done slight bit better.The main criticism really for me though is the way the film starts slow, it is just TOO slow paced and it really affects it in some ways, not enough happens and the dialogues doesn't do enough to draw you in. I also wasn't sure about some of the more dramatic scenes which seem well, over dramatic. The over dramatics don't make you hate parts but they damage it and chip away at it's rating.Fans of the book should be satisfied I feel, even if it may differ at all, it still provides a good show piece for the series and what is to come from the sequels. I think those less accustomed to the series should also enjoy, as alluded to many see it as a teen movie but it really isn't, has some good action but also some smart dialogue which I think can catch any movies fans attention and let them have some fun with it.Overall it is Solidly a Good film. I said about it being chipped away at and that is what happens, it doesn't end getting worse it kind of gets better as it goes along and you shouldn't be bored by the ending, that's the best part. I felt there is a chance you can have an emotional bond with the characters especially in certain scenes, you want to support them all the way through and only the most hardened of cynical people would want to see them fail.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
#1 Film of 2012,"'The Hunger Games' is one of my favorite, if not my #1 favorite, book series of all time. The movie was a really good film.

They left things out and changed a lot of things, which is expected for any book-screen adaptions. Books will always be better than the screen adaptions.

"I'd watch it again,but the book was way better","The movie was quite good but it seemed so drab compared to the book.The book was so much better.They cut out so many scenes and what happened to the mayors daughter?Katniss doesn't buy the mocking jay pin,the mayor's daughter gives her the pin!So I'd say that the book was way better than the movie.Even if you don't compare the book to the movie,the movie wasn't all that good.The train journey to the Capitol was so short and so were the training sessions.Now,here's what I think about the games.The games seemed so short,like they were two days when it was actually 2 weeks.Although,some scenes were really good and funny.The movie's soundtrack is really good,it has Taylor Swift and The Sting.So the movie was actually good,but I expected so much more.Yes,I'd love to watch the movie again.""Happy Hunger Games & may the odds be ever in your favor"". :)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellently Done,"The movie was absolutely amazing. Some die-hard fans of the books may be angered that Katniss wasn't narrating every step of the way, and we weren't trapped inside her skull; to this I respond, ""It's a movie."" Very few things were cut from the plot, and absolutely none of them were major. Gary Ross did an amazing job of converting the dark, immediate tone of the book to the big screen, and though some will be annoyed by the shaky camera shots, I personally liked them; they captured Katniss's very distracted, flighty view of the world. Suzanne Collins also did an amazing job of showing the back-story and logic behind the Hunger Games through scenes highlighting the Gamemakers, Seneca Crane and President Snow, highlighting that this twisted spectacle is being put on not only as entertainment for the Capitol, but also as a political tool to keep the Districts in line. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing; she captured every one of Katniss's emotions perfectly, really bringing her to life. The rest of the cast also gave amazing performances, and I am really looking forward to the prospect of seeing these actors again in the sequels. I strongly predict that The Hunger Games will become the next film series to stick in mind as a hallmark of this generation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I will probably read the book now.,"Being hailed as the next ""Twilight"" wasn't what drew me into going to see ""The Hunger games."" I actually wanted to see it because it sounded like more, and something interesting in a year over populated with remakes, rehashes, and sequels.Set in the not to distant future, ""The Hunger games"" sees a complicated world split up into districts. Where 2 children from each district must compete in ""The Hunger games,"" a nasty game off survival where only one will survive. Think ""The Running man"" meets ""Lord of the flies.""Now I'm going to technically stick up for this flick. Some have dismissed it straight away because off its love story or because off its restricting PG13 rating. But I've got to admit that a majority off the movie had me glued. Its just a shame that the unpredictable direction I thought it was going in (which made me want too see it right through to the end) takes the easy way out, which just so happens to be the most unlikely way.Overall, I think it's better than what adult men would assume from it, but not the work off genius that teenage girls will be making it out too be.

I loved all three of them, and waited anxiously for the movie to come out. And I saw the movie today in avant premiere and I was really excited! Usually movies based on books do not meet expectations. But this one is rather different: it is really good! Worth every minute of it, 100%! The whole atmosphere of the book is very well given, and the same with the characters too -- they are as real as they can be, acting great. You get carried away by the story and when the movie ends, you just want more!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Interesting film that fails to engage,"It could be argued that we are living in the last decades of Western Civilisation as we know it. The connotations of our popular culture has all the elements of distraction from what actually matters within our society. Reality television is now the most watched entertainment, with it's collection of delusional contestants vying for their 15 minutes of fame, along with the populous need to both humiliate and celebrate people of little worth. This format of mass-distraction is mirrored in the fall of the Roman Empire, which had its Gladiatorial Colosseum's as both a form of distraction and control. In the 21st century, television (along with other forms of media communication) is used to control and sedate the masses, and foment apathy in the population. It is also a form of contagion that infects those who believe they can also be rich and famous with little or no ability or talent. This seems to be what The Hunger Games is attempting to comment on, within the context of a distopian future.Set after an uprising during a war, North America has been divided into 12 districts controlled by its centre, The Capitol. Each year one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are selected by a lottery from each district to fight to the death in a televisual show. From district 12, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), volunteers herself for the event after her younger sister was selected. Along with male contestant, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), are transported to the Capitol, which resembles the Roman cities that the film is attempting to align itself with. After training and attempts to get sponsors, they are let out into a forest world to fight.I really can't be bothered to explain any further the plotting or character narratives within this film, as you will more than likely have seen it before: The Hunger Games has similar themes, and has an incredibly similar storyline to both Battle Royale (2000) and The Running Man (1987). Whilst it's central character is played well by Lawrence (she has a slight presence on screen with her ordinary beauty), she has very little to do in a weak script, and obvious plotting. The films iconography is lifted wholesale from Roman history, and its depiction of a vapid elitist population fails to enlighten the initial premise (that admittedly could have been good). Within the first hour the film also manages to insult the spectator by repeating certain scenes of dialogue only 20 minutes after it was initially shown (""We are totally aware that that happened, cause not much has happened since, and it happened moments ago"").Writer Suzanne Collins has stated that the inspiration for the book came from channel hopping between reality TV and the Iraq war, but she fails to find a voice strong enough to contextualise all the information into a credible framework, and simply seems to use the idea to speak only to the idiots who watch the reality TV that she seems to want to criticise; in other words the idea has been produced in much more intelligent ways elsewhere, whilst The Hunger Games decreases its concepts to feed it to the masses. Back to the 2010's, it has been suggested that around 90% of teenagers desire fame. In this narrative world, this desire simply is not there. In conclusion, interesting idea which fails to interest - the film is too long, and it simply does not engage.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Suzanne Collins is a Winnner!,"Was a big fan of these books. They rock. This conecept is so unbelievably good. So much props to suzanne collins for writing this brilliant work of fiction. Great story, really emotionally charged and executed really well in this film. Interestingly i found myself covered in goosiebumps a lot in this film, and even getting choked up at times. Which is interesting indeed considering i rarely get emotional in films. Shows the power of this story!This film has got a great cast. Seriously great. It brought out some real actors and actresses in the spotlight. Without this cast this movie may have fallen apart. And they ought be glad this film cast the spotlight, because they wouldnt have been able to afford them if the world knew how good they were. Yes, this movie seems to have some budget issues. It looks bad. The color grading is bland... just awful really. You can create a dark bland dystopia without making it look like a student film. It is possible. I swear I have made films with better colors then this. Also the way the camera works in this film just feels cheap and lazy.

Excellent movie,"Excellent movie, I recommend it. It keeps you entertained at all times in history and is completely different from any other story. At first, When I got to watch the movie, I didn't know what I would see, my couple took me to watch it without having seen the trailer before, then I didn't know what I would expect, the new representation of Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) was stunning, she resembled her representation with the other movies in which she have participated before, I consider this movie was a big step to her career because his performance was excellent and in no again, but believe me, you really need to watch this movie to know what I'm talking about, when I got to know the story during the course of the movie, caught my full attention, I never had heard story without equal, I hope soon to buy Blu-ray.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Simply breathtaking...,"I had read the book and had really high expectations of the movie, but the movie was absolutely amazing! It's definitely worth the money and time and a big A+. Most of the plot remained faithful to the book (as much as it could be), and Jennifer played Katniss, the girl on fire, extremely well. In fact, the whole cast was amazing and each character succeeded in playing the depth of their role.Everything in the movie is well balanced. The romance story wasn't too much to ruin it and was just perfect. The violence was just right. And I personally loved the visual effects in the movie. The beginning set an excellent background for the movie, and the action part (the hunger games) was just of the right length.The movie didn't drag on endlessly and left you only wanting for more.

"If you want the full story, read the books... The movie is watchable, but not great","Pales in comparison to the books it's based on.The movie wasn't terrible. It has issues, though. Without nitpicking at the little things, the biggest short-coming is the lack of character development. It's hard to get emotionally invested in any of them because there's very little effort made (or maybe just very little success) to give the characters any real depth or characteristics that a viewer can really identify with. There are just too many holes in the story.... How the world got where it got and so on... You practically have to have read the books to fill in the holes in the plot.So, in short.... The movie was watchable, but it obviously fell very short of what it could have been. I really feel that they should've gone with better, more extensively detail in their adaptation of the books and taken the R-rating that would obviously have come with it. The teenage drama they tried to make believable just didn't work given the movie's context and the lack of character development.While I can't call this type of movie ""entertainment"" given the context, it does make one think and question the depths of depravity people can fall to.... Is such a world so far-fetched? Might not be...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hunger Games and the slow death of cinema,"I went to see this movie, without high hopes – but interested in what I thought would be a story focusing mostly on a dysfunctional futuristic society, and the reasons why it has turned to this barbaric way of treating different classes of society. However I had a lot of apprehension about it – with the hints of it probably becoming the next 'Twilight.' My conclusion 2 and a half grueling hours later, is that it is a stupid movie, made for a stupid audience. And it is bad cinema. Its target audience is most definitely the twilight fans lost at the end of the saga.Every single moment that might not have been 100% clear to the audience, was spelled out even further by a voice over LITERALLY telling the cinema what was going on. For example 'I wonder if they realise that it's a booby trap,' and then 'It looks like she has worked out how this booby trap works.'The reason that I felt that this story was completely unbelievable, was the explanation of why they have this class system and why they have these 'hunger games.' It was explained that it is a constant reminder of war, and so that there can be a winner that people can support. This is all well and good, if the movie had structured a society around this that worked. Perhaps if they had gone the way of propaganda and brainwashing, pushing the society to see these horrendous games as warnings to the people. This would have fitted in nicely with the media. That the media controls the world and the classes, entertaining the rich by the slow destruction of the poor. I just did not believe that a society that can create trains that travel at the speed of light, and a cream that can cure any cut, that they will treat people so cruelly that they can cheer when children are slaughtered with an axe.The constant use of shaky close ups, gave me a headache as well as confusing the hell out of me. In the two most important fights, the use of constantly jolting close ups left me unaware who was winning or losing, or even what was happening. It also didn't help that in these two fights, the two people fighting look EXACTLY the same.And was it just me, or did anyone find this movie a little racist? The whole notion of there being one sector that was mainly black, with black people representing them in the game. This is the sector that starts the rebellion. Also, I found it insane that one of the African American characters spared the life of Katnis because he had saved the life of another young black girl, we see no connection between them previously, and must assume they are on the same team because they are the same race. Also, another huge racial thing I noticed was that the entire upper class were white, there were no Asian's or African Americans, no one from any other race than Caucasian. And the fact that it is a fashion statement that everyone in the upper class paints their faces white, is just way too KKK for me. Maybe I am reading too far into it, but its something I could not ignore and it really offended me.This movie left me feeling really angry, because I know I cannot just walk away from it and forget about it – there is probably another 5 movies to come – and if the first one is horrible, who knows how truly horrible the others could be.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Bloodsport of THE HUNGER GAMES,"A mega-best selling trilogy by Suzanne Collins has spawned this first installment, The Hunger Games, adapted by Collins, Billy Ray, and director Gary Ross for the big screen as a satisfying adventure thriller featuring a terrific performance by budding superstar, Jennifer Lawrence. The film avoids the pitfalls of previous best-sellers turned into films that lacked a sound structure for the uninitiated readers (as in The Da Vinci Code); it works quite well for newbies. The filmmakers have kept the main storyline compelling and emotional within the framework of an action film.In the not too distant future, a group of twelve districts has been punished for 74 years for a failed rebellion. Each year, they must participate in a random lottery or 'reaping' of their youth for a lethal competition, a fight to the death with only one winner. The games are grand, lavish events that are in essence, public executions in the guise of entertainment. There are specific rules and boundaries except when they suit the whims of the game masters. Food, weapons, and supplies are made available but not without an accompanying danger, and there are sponsors who can provide life saving assistance and support in timely ways.In one district, Katniss (Lawrence) is a teenage girl who is good with a bow and arrow and dotes after her younger sister, Primrose, and their mother. She is close to a boy, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who has strong feelings for her. When Primrose and a boy, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), are chosen for reaping, it sets off a surprising series of events including a desperate sacrifice by Katniss as the chosen few must train for their lives in a competition that is televised nationwide. The contestants are feted like celebrities and are mentored by a former survivor named Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) with support from Cinnas (Lenny Kravitz effective in a brief role). When these modern day gladiators are released into the wild, loyalties are tested and survival instincts take over, and a grand spectacle is replaced by a grim fate that awaits all but one survivor.Director Ross (Seabiscuit) knows how to tell a good story and he is aided immensely by a strong cast that melds newcomers with seasoned veterans like Harrelson, Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland. Special mention goes to Elizabeth Banks as a macabre emcee. Lawrence (Winter's Bone) shines in a physically demanding role, but she never shortchanges her ability to show feelings and angst in a convincing way. You root for her and feel her pain. Her portrayal of Katniss has a genuine decency and soul which, despite the savage nature of the games, reveals her humanity for the world to see. Might her actions and deeds register among the masses and have far reaching consequences?This brave new world of deadly sport (that plays like a perverted version of TV's Survivor), is authentically realized by impressive set designs and costumes which contrast two disparate worlds-a pauper class of citizens and the gaudy elite. If much of this film's storyline sounds familiar, it draws from pop culture sources as Shirley Jackson's short story, The Lottery, and films like The Most Dangerous Game, The Truman Show, and The Running Man. Even elements of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and George Orwell's 1984 come to mind with its oppressed societies and ever watchful video screens, and when cannon fire signals a fallen victim, it echoes moments from Capricorn One. The sacrificial humans are dubbed 'tributes', a contradiction of terms not unlike Orwellian propaganda and its mixed meanings e.g. ""War is Peace"".While The Hunger Games ends in a manner that could be considered a conclusion, it does leave events open to a followup. Strong, emotional ties that are formed during the games have powerful implications at home, and the outcome sets the stage for the germination of a movement. I for one am very curious what will happen next.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good,"Great performances help enhance this amazing story of friendship. Katniss Everdeen voluntarily takes her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death in which two teenagers from each of the twelve Districts of Panem are chosen at random to compete. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the main characters. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was pleasant.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
the best movie i have ever seen no spoilers,this film is an excellent piece of cinema the acting is right on the effects are great everything about this film is just beyond cool.I have read the book and seen the film twice and both are equally awesome. I have no complaints about this movie.Out of all the book based movies i have seen this one stays almost fully true to it's source material. I am eagerlly awaiting the DVD release. this film has Oscar worthy performances. this a an absolutely flawless film. Yes the pg-13 rating really tones things down quite a bit but do not let that distract you from enjoying this beautiful film. I am looking forward for catching fire.If you only see one film this year make it The hunger games. BY the way stop whining about the shaky cam and watch the damn movie. Lastly shut the f*** up and stop whining about the quality of the movie. lastly I can see heavy differences and similarities to battle royale and it annoys me a bit but both are cinematic masterpieces. 10/10 the first perfect movie.

Its Jennifer Lawrence who Holds the movie with her incredible portrayal of Katniss Everdeen,"The Hunger Games – CATCH IT (B+) Based upon the popular YA Novel ""The Hunger Games"" about post apocalypse world, where America is split into 12 districts and every year two under 18 participates from each district participate in the deadly game of survivor to death till only one left alive. The Hunger Games has taken world by storm ever since its sort out to the Next Twilight Franchise. I've read the first chapter of the novel and I must say it's indeed one of the best foam of literature I've ever read. Now back to the movie, The Hunger Games starts really fast and within minutes it establishes the New World for us & the reason behind conducting the Hunger Games every year. Once Katniss Everdeen volunteer herself as a tribute to save her sister the movie gets little slow as we expect the hunger game to start sooner but in that time director took time to establish the new world and people of the Capitol. Who have become heartless & cari-creature of the nature, they enjoy in suffering of the young adults. The movie really picks up once the Hunger Game starts and from there till the end there is not a single dull moment. I also think that by not showing a single scene from the Game sequences in the promotional campaign has helped the movie a lot. As we don't have a single clue what will happened in the movie once they enter the arena.Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen is a perfect choice, she is innocent, naive yet strong hearted. There are moments in the movie when you see how incredible artist she is ... whether at the Reaping, when she volunteer herself or when she remembers how Peeta had thrown burnt bread at her in the rain when she was starving or when she attacks Peeta after he says he had crush on her or when she climbs the tree to save her life from other tributes or when a young tribute dies in her arms. There are many moments like these which showcase her enormous talent. Now let's talk about Josh Hutcherson Aka. Peeta, I think Josh is a one note actor who always played lonesome/misfit whether it's Bridge to Terabithia, The Kids are Alright or now The Hunger Games. I wanted Peeta to be someone who can stand next to Katniss at least in physicality... at times he looks really shorter & immature in front of her. Though he played his part well so I won't say he was bad but a perfect casting for Peeta would have taken that actor to stardom like R-Pattz. Liam Hemsworth had rarely any screen time but he was very calm & settled. Alexander Ludwig, Leven Rambin & Isabella Fuhrman as villainous tributes were great. Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Lenny Kravitz & Wes Bentley were great. Overall, the Hunger Games is a good movie which stands strongly upon Jennifer Lawrence's shoulders. It's not a typical formula love story and the ending doesn't leave a single clue for the sequels so it would be really interesting to see how story progresses with these characters for those who haven't read the books yet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Highly focused, intense and brilliant","The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins provides a very exciting, stirring read, engaging young adults – and now of course adults too – with major issues in today's world.I saw The Hunger Games movie having read the trilogy a couple of years ago. I found the books compelling in their narrative of horrific events, in the end delivering several shocks with the deaths and betrayals of characters I liked, but also some ingenious turning points. I felt the final outcome could have been more redemptive / uplifting, especially in view of the epic forces of good and evil this story deals with.The forces of evil in this hypothetical future America are spiralling decadence, selfishness, obsession with glamour, image and celebrity, and inhumanity – and looking at our own world, if these forces were to reach a certain pitch we can see they would indeed lead us to some such outcome as the Hunger Games. In Panem, the inhabitants of The Capitol revel in the ultimate reality TV, entertained by the violent deaths of randomly drawn teenage ""Tributes"" from the oppressed Districts. Those Capitol citizens behave just as the crowds did in the ampitheatres of Ancient Rome. The fact that the young people drawn by lot then sent out to fight to the death are first glamorised, feted and paraded in front of the cameras alongside an oily TV host, makes it even more chilling. Another strong motif is the vacuous sentimentality of the massed audience, leading them to gush at a possible love affair between the main protagonist Katniss and her fellow-tribute Peeta whilst being equally ready to watch them meet a horrible death at the whim of the Gamemakers under the merciless direction of their Chief, Seneca Crane.What stood out for me in the movie was Katniss herself. Played by Jennifer Lawrence she was totally absorbing. Her compassion, her courage, her survival skills and her subtle resistance of the evil in which she was forced to take part shone out. The intense concentration on Katniss's every move in the Arena made me feel I was there with her. Our attention and our hopes were 100% on Katniss. The empathy and support she won from her allies Haymitch and Cinna also made a strong emotional impact.The premise of the story, and narrative flow of the movie was highly unusual and intense. The cinema audience sat in silence throughout, a silence to match the silence behind the action for the first part of the film – save for a few moments in the last half of the film when emotional reactions were inevitable! Brilliant, unforgettable and a sharply-focused portrayal of some of the worst excesses of the western world taken to their logical conclusion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hunger Games,"The movie version was well done. Elizabeth Banks was excellent. Jennifer Lawrence was too tall and well-fed for the book's smallish Katniss. I thought the young actors, except for the tall, tough-looking blond actress, Leven Rambin, who played Glimmer, looked too small and soft, especially the actors who played Cato and Clove. Cato and Clove were huge in size and ferocious-looking in the book. Cato was especially a major presence in the book, but much less so in the movie. I thought the tough-looking Mr. Hemsworth should have played Cato, and the tall, tough-looking Ms. Rambin should have played Clove. Too many times pretty boys and girls in Hollywood don't look and talk tough enough, and that's why they can't transition to adult action roles. I was disappointed in the book and movie that religion was left out completely, especially Christianity. Latinos were non-existent, yet they are the fastest-growing minority in the U.S. right now. Maybe they were wiped out in District 13?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Does It Satisfy Your Hunger?,"On this hot day I decided to cool off by going to my favorite thing of all time, that's right a movie. This week's flick I decided to check out was the Hunger Games, the movie based on Suzanne Collins' book. Now despite the international sensation that is the book, I wondered just how well the movie would live up to the hype and excitement that has built up over the past few months. Right now I'll tell you it is a decent movie, but for me did not live up to the craze.Perhaps the first thing I should say in this movie is how spot on the acting was for every character. As we saw in X-Men first class, Jennifer Lawrence's acting ability is incredible and very believable. Lawrence seems to have a knack for playing classic characters, and she managed to fill the very big shoes of the main character Catniss. Starring opposite of her is Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta. Hutcherson was a good pick for this role as his work in the past has required him to play that quiet, awkward, nice boy who seems to get caught in the most unfortunate situations and still come out okay. The duo seemed to have a natural chemistry for their roles, and their interactions mirrored what they read in the book. The mentors of Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) were also well done. Harrelson in particular captures the drunk, desperado quite well, yet portrays the concerned and caring tutor at the same time. It still surprises me how much of a chameleon he is as well. As for the other contestants, the casting did their jobs well and managed to select the right people in both look and attitude, especially Rue (Amandla Stenberg). Yes there are plenty of other actors to mention, but I only have limited space so I'll end this part with saying Stanley Tucci) was the perfect choice for Caesar, and his cheesy smile fit right in with the setting.But Robbie did they stick close to the story? Yes, they did, for the most part anyway. The crew in charge of this movie managed to adapt the book well, especially with the scenes and sequences focusing on the games. A lot of the man vs. nature element, or in this case woman vs. nature is captured with the camera work in the right angles to make one feel as if you were right there with Catniss. Most of the character interactions are shown as well, though a few of the extra actors have some laughable moments where they overact. What the movie lacks from the book however is a lot of the memories and internal thoughts that Catniss has, which as we know is kind of what the book focuses on. Parts where she is sitting in a tree, combing through the woods, or even sitting in a cave were a little less interesting without realizing what was going on in her head. Had they had that internal conflict it would have probably brought a little more understanding to some of the scenes, but again it's a movie and there is only so much more you can do.What else do I have to say about this movie? Well for one thing let's talk about the action. Depending on what you consider good action will determine whether or now you are impressed with this movie. Those looking for exciting, fast paced, weapon on weapon action will not be impressed with this movie as there is very little combat between the contestants. The little amount of combat there is a little difficult to follow, as the camera shows only glimpses of the fighters as it zooms around like a chicken with its head cut off. I suppose this is to avoid showing graphic kills on young kids, which is a good thing, but if that were going to be the approach I would have just skipped this scene. However, those who are looking for more the survival action and clever use of environment for killing, will be satisfied with this movie. Regardless of the action, the pace of the movie is good, not too fast and not too slow. All of the emotions you read in the book are in the film as well, and there were plenty of times I saw the audience quiver, cry, and cringe at the various scenes in the movie.To wrap this up, Hunger Games is a good movie that is definitely one of the better book adaptations I have seen in a while. With its fantastic acting, beautiful scenery, and accurate representation of the book, this film definitely deserves some attention. However, it still wasn't worth the hype for me and still has some things I missed from the book. Action wise it was okay, but again I'm more for fast paced action as opposed to the survival action seen in this movie. My final scores for this movie are as follows:Action/Sci-fiction: 7.0-7.5 Movie overall: 8.0I would say it's worth a trip to the theater and a good movie to see with friends, significant others, or even by your self. Until next time though this is Robbie K signing out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
All that I expected but less.,"This review is going to be short and written by a rookie.I think it is very hard to review the movie once you have read the book, or at least objectively.For me this movie seemed pretty loyal to the book, but of course many details had been cut. But if there had been possibility to make a 5-hour- movie, it could have been great.In my opinion Jennifer Lawrence just nailed it by acting rebellious Katniss. I didn't like her at the movie ''Like Crazy'' at all but in this movie she seemed to be in her element. Also other cast supported the movie pretty well. Only Wes Bentleys act didn't make any impression. I just couldn't find the same feeling with him and the book's Seneca.In the movies it is vital to be able to squeeze those hundreds of pages into a 2-hour-movie. This one didn't execute that perfectly, but I would still say: go see the movie, it was good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent,"This movie was gorgeous. It is definitely one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen in my entire life. It looks beautiful with the camera...I mean, if the characters are nervous and their thoughts are clouded, the camera makes everything buzzy and distant. The movie was emotional when it needed to be, action packed, and stayed VERY true to the book. The readers of the book will most definitely love this movie. The only time when small details were changed were only in three scenes. Those who did not read the book will also enjoy this book immensely(don't know if I spelled that right). This is one of the greatest movies out there. Jenifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Liam Hemsworth, and etc, all deserve awards for this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Confusing, boring and unpleasant.","When The Hunger Games came out, all non-book fans could think of was Asian flick Battle Royale of which I think is an okay but forgettable movie. Meanwhile, the concept of a televised people vs. people contest always reminded me of Arnie nostalgia-classic The Running Man. In retrospect, it's a pretty cheesy movie, but its execution with all its 80s gritty excess makes the idea chilling and believable in its dystopian world. My biggest problem with The Hunger Games is that never once did I feel the concept fit the world. I think it's a pretty good setup with the idea of a uprising that didn't work and that the upper class would punish them but with a kid v. kid battle to the death? There's something about the film that never once convinced me and it lost me right from the outset.Perhaps this is because the film so far removed from our world that there's no relatable one. On one hand, there's the districts which feel like a cleaned up Deadwood then there's the Baz Lurhman does Dr. Seuss civilized world. There's no believable sense of time transition from how it can get to its opening written setup to this world with its infrequent odd sci-fi flashes. It's trying too hard to have social commentary. Above all there's no heart beyond teenage angsty feelings and no sense of a morality we can relate to - albeit, Stanley Tucci was a delight and I wish he could host everything ever. Yeah, Jennifer Lawrence's protagonist is brave and I supported her but the writing was so underdeveloped that I found myself confused at what she was or wasn't doing a lot of the time.The film is just so contrived to try and force the concept to belong in this world. The plot is relatively easy to follow but there's way too many times when I found myself asking ""why are they doing this?"" without explanation and ""why don't they just do this?"" without ruling the alternatives out. I feel like the film never took a moral stance on the killings. Sure, the civilized world find it entertaining/punishment and the Deadwood world finds it tragic, fine, but I'm interested in the internal feelings of the ones actually involved. It just felt like their plan was ""to win"" but strategies were never revealed. Why didn't they just slaughter everyone while they were ""training"" with all the weapons? If they weren't allowed, why didn't the film demonstrate it beyond the few words ""don't fight here""? I never bought it.Maybe their plan was to just survive the best they could and stay hidden, but this was never stated. Why were people making alliances when there could only be one winner? It never made any sense, especially when there was absolutely no character development. Perhaps this is what you get with a film that's about the one thing it can't show with a PG-13 rating and shaky cam. I imagine these kinds of morality and strategy things are in the book and fans are just filling in these gaps by themselves, but The Hunger Games movie just confused and bored me with its slow plot-hole ridden script, unpleasant hook and unsatisfying climax. Give me The Running Man for the dozenth time instead, at least it has a bit of balls when it comes to its action.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hunger Games,"The ""Hunger Games"" by Suzan Collions is an enjoyable movie for all ages and it is a great family movie.. With the good in every movie follows the bad. Although the movie has its very few bad clips in the end the good out weights the bad.Although there are many different point of views to look at all of the good one very interesting topic is the twisted romance. Peeta and Katniss were thought to be ""star crossed lovers"" to the audience. Although Katniss dose not love Peeta, she some how manage to convince the Capitol into her plot.In Addition, the action is a big part in the story. Beside story the blood and violence, which may intrigue part of the audience, it is a great aspect to put into the book. It is a great attention grabber to show the seriousness of the situation.However, the few clips may be non-appealing to some select groups. One group and reason is adults and the violence. Many adults may think this amount of violence is inappropriate for the younger generation and the consequences of seeing this much violence could be damaging.Last but not least, a great thing about the book is it was helped directed by the author of the book. This is a great aspect of the movie because many movies based off of books derails from the details that make the book a great book.The ""Hunger Games"" is a great book for so many different reasons that have gone unmentioned. Although the movie has its bad parts, there is so much more good things than bad.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
LOVED this movie!!,"I absolutely loved this movie. I recently started reading the books. I wanted to finish the first one before the movie came out and wow the book was AMAZING! It made me even more excited to see this movie. I had very high expectations and they were definitely met! I am so happy with the cast that they chose. With Twilight, they chose the complete wrong actors which made the movies really bad. People cannot even compare this movie to the Twilight movies. This movie blows Twilight out of the water. The story was actually intriguing and interesting. The actors were very believable and I loved Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss! I am glad she is getting so much praise for this role because she deserves it! I can't wait to see the next couple movies!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Children and fans only.,"This movies received a great amount of hype, that's the main reason for watching the movie. The story starts promisingly but the plot is predictable, though not totally boring. The fans of this book might know better on how the story goes in the book, but I really found it movie just made for the children only.The main reason for this movies being such a hit maybe the reason of the fan following of the book itself. Certainly, it deserves a sequel as the story can be continued in a more interesting way that the non-fans of the book can also appreciate it. Most adults will get lots of points to criticize the scene but children will sure have a good time watching.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My review The hunger Games,"'AMAZING MOVIE'.I Would have to say one of the best movies i have seen ever (if not the best). the story-line is absolutely brilliant.Loved the books,but enjoyed the movie even more. Cannot wait for the second and third parts of the series. Being a teenager made the movie more interesting as It makes you think what if that became a future event around the world? well all in all this movie gets a rating of 10/10 from me. hopefully the next ones are just as brilliant. Be sure to read the books; (part 2 of the hunger games series)Catching Fire (part 3 ' ')And Mocking-jay. if you just cant wait for the next movies :) PS: the next movie is not coming till 13 November 2013 so i recommend reading the books.But if you don't want to ruin the amazing movie experience you'll just have to wait hehe.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A superb movie that almost conveys the book,"I just finished reading the 1st book after a while and resolved myself to watch the first movie. I can't be too hard on a movie nearly a decade ago, this film is an example of a book flick gone right.The setup of participating in the Hunger Games by force is dreadful and has you on your toes throughout the whole length. There are many empowering moments where even the most ordinary person can achieve greatness. By applying honed skills from their childhoods.This movie did something different compared to the books, it showed some perspectives of other characters not detailed originally. It did help to an extent to fill in the gaps of what would be confusing information about ""why this is happening.""However to anyone to reads the book, it will feel somewhat rushed. As well as missing key moments in the book gave it its formidable edge.You don't need to read the book to understand the movie, but it does make you more aware of what was implemented and left out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loved this movie!!,"I have read all of the books in this series, and I re-read them before seeing this movie despite the fact that this could have made me really aggravated by any deviations from the book! Turns out I had nothing to worry about, this screen adaption is excellent. I absolutely loved the casting (except for Donald Sutherland as President Snow - he wasn't evil enough, and President Snow should both obviously frightening and evil. The portrayal of the District 12 people versus the people of the Capital was well done, and the setting of the arena was very close to what I had imagined. I don't know how it could have been done better, even though there were small differences from the book, these didn't really matter. I'm so glad I saw The Hunger Games, and I really look forward to the next two movies - I'll be there when they open.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stanley Tucci Outsold,"I first watched the Hunger Games movies as they were coming out in 2012-2015 in my teenage years but revisiting the series as an adult in a severely different political climate in 2023 has given me a much broader reflection of the complex themes. Not only are the main plots of the films intriguing and sound as a concept of its own, but there's a larger commentary surrounding just the hero, Katniss, and her journey.The scope of the story begins pretty small. The setting is in District 12, a poor, mining state where food can be slim and is described as the least important to the Capitol, home of the government and ruling elite. The color palette consists of bland neutral tones, depicting a dim life full of monotony. Over every scene before Katniss leaves her home is covered with a blue tint that sombers the mood. The primitive nature of District 12 is evident in the shaky camerawork and small flashes of small animals like squirrels and rabbits being consumed as food- unlike American society as we know it.The chaos of the reaping in which Katniss volunteers for her sister, Prim, is emotional though lacks a soundtrack. As an individual film, this aspect may not be glaring, but as a part of the Hunger Games series, this moment sticks out like a sore thumb against the iconicity of its successors. However, the film easily makes up for its few lackluster soundtrack absences with setting up a vital plot device: the four notes whistled to the mockingjays in the games. As someone who did not read the books, I feel like it would've been hard to imagine what it was to describe them on paper, because the ones chosen for the film fit perfectly.Having enough time with the tributes is vital to the plot. It's a bolder choice to use that world building in what could've been made as an ""action film"" because it could be perceived as just delaying the actual games. But I view this as a significant indicator that the franchise was in good hands that cared about a faithful adaptation, humanizing the other tributes, building anticipation for how they will all interact in the arena...Once the games begin, the cuts between the children in the arena and the game makers in the room designing the threats they will face underline the cruelty of the Capitol and of Panem. In terms of cinematography and colorization, there was a distinct change in camera style between District 12 and the Capitol and then the Capitol to the arena. Shaky camera styling makes a great impact in the cut between the Capitol and the arena specifically. The shots showing the tributes feel as if they are homemade from just feet away, running through the woods alongside them, while the cameras on the Capitol are smooth and reminiscent of the talk shows we see on our own TVs every night.Stanley Tucci may have the most difficult character to nail in the series, and he is the unsung hero of the first installment by far. Since there are very few names or faces assigned to the citizens of the Capitol, he is tasked with bringing an entire elite ruling class to life just as one person, Caesar Flickerman, and he nails it. It takes a great deal of talent to have a character that continuously, on a yearly basis, popularizes and shows off children just before they're sent off to their death as entertainment, yet still be a likable fan-favorite. It seems impossible, but he executes it flawlessly.So as not to spoil anything about the film, the review will stop here, but this is a great first step in the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stealing from Japan. Again.,"Battle Royal, the Japanese wonder from which ""author"" Suzanne Collins stole the plot to ""write"" 'The Hunger Games', was nothing short of a unique piece of art in a sometime dull cinema industry. It was refreshing, brilliantly played, and even had Takeshi Kitano in it.And then came the cash cow makers, yearning for fast-money franchise. Makes sense though, you wouldn't work for the lesser salary either. Their job is to make huge profits, and this usually comes with a total absence of feeling. Fair enough!But 'Hunger Games', really... It is the diet version of entertainment. A terrible actress to begin with. And if you have seen American Hustle or the recent X-Men movies, you know it is not ready to change. Jennifer Lawrence has no acting, no understanding of her roles, and to be true, millions out there are still trying to make sense with her Oscar...Then come the Art Direction... Again, no creativity, everything being taken from more glorious creators from the past. Make-up just looks like Ziggy Stardust had more offspring than we thought. Costumes look like 'The Shindler List' VERY unfortunately met 'Zoolander' with a failed attempt to ""Jean-Paul Gaultier"" the overall look. And let's not talk about the boring settings... Even if creativity rides along with inspiration, there is a huge step between referencing and raiding. This is clearly the latter.And yet, there is ONE beacon of hop amidst all this terribly annoying waste of time: the next 'Hunger Game' movie. Stanley Tucci alone gives more credit to the franchise than any other previous actors. Then of course Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore. Obviously. Let us just hope that the mediocrity that transpired through the first movies will be washed away by this brilliant cast.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Adaptation,"I was aware that the movie had been made while reading the novel. One thing I kept wondering was, ""How in the heck are they going to do this in the movie?"" I just couldn't picture how the film could capture the imagery and storyline. I was very impressed with the movie. The casting was spot on, the acting was excellent, and the settings were perfect. So much of how the movie was filmed was exactly how I imagined it in the book.Obviously, the biggest hurdle in any movie adaptation from a book is trying to encompass everything that happens in the book into a 2 hour time slot. Let me just say that NO movie can do this, and no movie ever has recreated the entire story of a book. It just can't be done in such a time frame. Had they done that, people would complain that the 6 hour movie was too long. Despite these restrictions, the film did an excellent job of capturing the feel of the book, and the emotions of the book.In my opinion, anyone who is a big fan of the books should watch the movie twice. Once to learn about what is kept, edited in the movie and to digest the differences; then a second time to simply enjoy the movie, knowing already what has been cut/added, and just enjoy the feel of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good movie but the book is a masterpiece!,"Last night i went to see the movie which i was expecting like crazy after i read the books. To my personal opinion the 1st book is an absolute masterpiece so i had a lot expectations from the movie. From the very firest second it was obvious that they would go it by the book. Very good location, very good actors and actresses. Jennifer is amazing as Katniss, same goes to Josh and Liam! Speaking in generally i'd say that for someone who is fan of Hunger games the movie is good enough but i have a huge objection about the script. Very weak script. First of all i think they shouldn't change the way Katniss got her pin. Secondly they forfeit the best lines from Peeta and Haymich. Lines such as Haymich's Stay alive and Peeta's You came here to finish me off sweetheart?, should remain while it's not clear if there's a romance between Peeta and Katniss cauz in movie it's Haymich who's throws the idea to Seneka in order to protect katniss. Despite the negative points you still feel the spirit of the book, while everyone, from first to the last cried at Rue's death scene! You could hear people whipping...So, just go for it and may the odds ever be for movie's favour!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Visuals Out of Texts: The Beauty of Adapting,"If you wanted to watch a faithful adaptation of a novel for the big screen, then The Hunger Games is a perfect starting point. The film is able to capture not only the main story and important details, but the feeling and aesthetics described in the book. The dialogue, characters and scenes feel like a translation into visual media, without any need for re-imagining or reworking. The novel is what captivated audiences and launched the story to its lofty heights, and so an accurate representation was necessary. Unlike many films in the past in which directors can take many liberties with relatively less popular novels, The Hunger games follows on with the trend of young adult literature, think Harry Potter and Twilight, which is so universally well-known that nothing can be changed without provoking the ire of wanting young audiences. In this regard, The Hunger Games has done its job and given the people what they demanded.One interesting, but not entirely novel, problem faced with a film adaptation was the first person narrative in the novel. Katniss is the narrator and main character, and much of the exposition happens in her head. The novel is relatively sparse on dialogue for a large chunk of it, but we have Katniss to help guide us through the various newly introduced details. In the film, however, we don't have her inner monologue. Instead, the film opts to have Caeser Flickerman and his co-host act as elucidators during the Games, and the intermittent flash-backs inform us of the backstory for Katniss and Peeta. The film is not over-the-top with its backstory, giving us only the bare minimum of what we need to fill in the blanks. This is okay, because they know that many of those who come to see the movie have already read the book and know the details. However, any new fan coming into the series starting with the films might have their work cut out for them to understand the finer points.The visual representations are also stunning. On one side we have the districts, garbed in 1940s style clothing as a symbol of living under totalitarianism mimicked from our own often sad world. They are lacking of all luxuries and indulgences. We get a short glimpse of this austere world in Katniss's household and the depressing village she lives in. Then suddenly we are shocked by the image of Effie Trinket, a fluorescent china doll in a gray world. It is like coming out of a dark room and seeing the sun for the first time, it blinds you. The contrast between the people in the Capital and those in the districts could not be any clearer. It is hedonism versus survival. The pastries and parties and petticoats and an insult to the lifetime of struggle faced by the peasantry, and that comes across astutely in the film.Despite the nearly two and a half hour length, the film still feels as though it were somewhat rushed. The important setup is skimmed over in favor of getting to the Games quicker, but still arrives there at the one hour mark. This is sensible from a marketing perspective, you want the action to take up the majority of the film. It is somewhat of an unsolvable problem. The film must necessarily be the entire plot from start to finish and not broken up into two parts (leave that to the final installment after your audience is already emotionally invested). Yet it still needs to summarize a relatively complex plot with an entirely new world in a short amount of time and satisfyingly display all of the important action. There isn't enough time to flesh out certain things, like Katniss's love triangle, or Haymitch's true character, but the film does as best as it can. In this regard, it gets a passing grade.Another limiting factor is the desire to make the film available to all audiences, that is to say, to tone down the violence and allow for a PG rating. This story is another unfortunate casualty of the MPAA and the need for as wide a reach as possible. What is this story about, really? It's about teens tearing each other apart in bloody gladiatorial conquest. It is violence to the umpteenth degree. If ever there was a film that deserves as much blood and gore as possible, this is it. This is not the fault of the filmmakers, they did their due diligence in trying to show as much as possible. This is more of a ""disgruntled critic shaking his fist as the system"" type of situation.The film is not perfect by any stretch, as it comes from a rather imperfect book. The novel did not reach its zenith on the back of Collins' stupendous ability to create lifelike characters. Nor was it on her convincing ability to make a romantic subplot. These faltering details are present in the film too, though somewhat compensated by the acting abilities of Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson, among others. The story is amazing because of its premise. It is a collectathon mixed with a battle royale with an intriguing political subplot of fascism and cultural revolution. It feels like something that can inspire us and give us refuge from our own world. Despite its fantastical elements, it feels like something you could place yourself into, and it almost makes you wish you could be there to see if you could survive.Where this film succeeds is in its ability to take an already successful and interesting novel and put it into visual terms that everyone can enjoy. Where it fails is paradoxically in the same way, where it was too true to the book when it could have improved or reinterpreted. Dialogue that works in text doesn't always feel lifelike coming from a real person, nor does an exciting action sequence look as exciting on screen. That being said, The Hunger Games should not be overlooked in the ever-growing genre of teen-fantasy novel adaptations. It is not a masterpiece or a hidden gem, but it is fun and worthwhile. Not everyone can be Peter Jackson and create something as monumental and consistently lauded as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but we can hope not to go too far and become The Hobbit. Settling for a solid middle grounds of Harry Potter is a pretty good place to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
NOT a teenage movie at all,"One might immediately assume that because the movie is about adolescents, it has action sequences and a well known cast then it is a big budget block buster movie that has good production value, but zero story. It is not so.The Hunger Games is the first book in a trilogy (I know, they are either a trilogy or a saga nowadays) and the subject is nothing if not socially and politically deep.You see, in a fictive country named Panem, there is a Capitol, something very reminiscent of Rome in a technological Roman empire and 12 districts that are ruled with an iron fist. Each year each district provides a boy and a girl, randomly chosen, as tribute in order to fight to the death for the pleasure of the people in the Capitol.Now, the clichés that you would have expected at this point make their absence obvious. The main character is a girl, the games do not result in the destruction of evil and the win of good, nor does every character act like a piece of cardboard.Without revealing more, I urge you to watch this. The main actors play well, the story is interesting, the effects are nice, but not extraneous to the plot, while the overall feeling is of observing great injustice and being almost powerless against it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Good,"This movie is very well done considering its target audience. If you want a violent movie with a lot of cussing in it, this movie is not for you. However, if you want a dramatic film that is a safer alternative, and something to take your kids to, then this is Perfect. Its violence and drama are on par with the Narnia series, and Woody Harrelson's performance will be enough to get a few laughs from all you parents out there. It is a little bit cheesy in the same way that most Post-Apocalyptic films tend to be, but over-all I found it very enjoyable. I was glad that I went to see this film BEFORE I even saw the trailers, or watched any of the cast interviews or anything like that. I went it to the theater completely Raw, I had never read the books, or seen any of the ""hype"", and having seen the film First, and then investigated it further afterward. This film measures up to its publicity quite well. Do not base your decision to see this film based on what you've read, just GO see it and make up your own mind.

Fantastic adaptation to the hunger games!,"Let me just say that I have read the books many times, at least five times each. I have been looking forward to this movie ever since they announced that lionsgate had acquired the rights to make the film. That being said, I have been slightly dreading the release of the film because I was so afraid that they would butcher my favorite books ever. I am very, very happy to say that that did not happen!My girlfriend made me read these books and I was not expecting to enjoy a book starring a 16 year old girl but suzzanne Collins is a genius and truly knows how to capture an audience's imagination. I was worried that lionsgate would be unable to do the same thing, even though I was ecstatic about the hiring of Jennifer Lawrence (she is an incredible actress!) I am glad to say that they completely blew me away! I have no idea why people are complaining about character development, they did an incredible job with that, and why they are saying katniss should have been skinnier; I would rather take a gorgeous and talented Jennifer Lawrence over some anorexic terrible actress like Kristen Stewart. and I loved the shaky camera, it makes you feel like you are right there in the action.

Unsettling and thought-provoking,"The main thematic elements of this film have been covered many times by many great books and films but The Hunger Games still is an exciting and worthwhile watch. I was impressed that they were packaged for a slightly younger intended audience than classics like 1984, The Lord of the Flies and V For Vendetta. As with Lord of the Flies, the actions are all the more disturbing as they are being performed by and on children.The premise is a little shaky. There does not seem to be any reason why holding The Hunger Games is the best way to keep the rebellious districts in check. However, if we accept that this *is* the way that The Capitol wants to do it, the way that they manipulate the population and the competitors is very well executed.The suspense is palpable throughout although the shaky camera that is one of the techniques used is irritating in the beginning of the movie. It is used to better effect during combat when it obscures gratuitous violence and conveys panic and disorientation. The violence was greater than I expected for a film aimed at young adults but the themes mean that it is not in vain and it is used to further the story.I must admit to liking films with bad guys who I can get truly angry at. Although I did restrain myself the urge to throw popcorn was quite high in parts. It is possible to get emotionally wrapped-up in the story and a few tears were shed. In some of these parts it was quite obvious what was going to happen and the suspense comes from observing when and how. Perhaps that is the inevitable problem with stating from the beginning of the story that most of the characters will die.Although this is the first of a trilogy and there are some loose ends, the major plot elements have been wrapped up by the end of the film. I did not feel short-changed as I have with others, but it did leave me wanting more and I don't intend to wait for the next film as I have not read the books yet.I came out of the movie thinking about a lot of things, and comparing it with the great works I have mentioned before. If I thought for certain that this movie belonged in the same echelon as those I would have given it a 10 but by virtue of conveying the message in the way it did, to new audiences, and making me leave the theatre deep in thought it deserves my high rating.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Hunger Games Movie Review,"Main Character: Katniss, Peeta
Plot: There are 12 districts, there is a drawing to pick 2 contestants from each district to play in the Hunger Games( A killing game).I thought the acting in the first Hunger Games movie was really impressive. Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job as Katniss. She was able to Convey so much emotion and depth into the character. I also thought Josh Hutcherson played the role of Peeta really good. He brought a lot of depth into his role, and i thought his chemistry with Jennifer Lawrence was really strong. Overall, I think the acting in the first Hunger Games movie was a big part of what made it such a emotional story.In my opinion, the first Hunger Games was really well-done adaption of the book. I think the film makers did a great job of bringing the world of Panem to life. They made the movie feel real and emotional. I also like how the movie tackled some really big themes, like the power of nature, the effects of trauma, and the importance of standing up against injustice.

the first part,"Because it's the first part of the series, there's a lot of lack of background information. For example, the gesture of three fingers is worth 10 minutes. In addition, in order to get the PG13 rating, some shots should not be shown in the game. On the whole, loyalty to the original, but lead to a pale film story; plot development is slightly delayed; the ending of the second episode is limited to love triangle, should the president do something at the end?

"Great story, good movie.","I haven't read the book so I can't compare the two. One would imagine that since the author was involved in production, the movie is to some extent an accurate rendition of the author's intent. The story is well known so I won't summarize it here. There are two parts to this movie, the events prior to the actual hunger games and the hunger games themselves. In the preparatory part we get to know about the world this takes place in and a tiny bit about our characters.The world of The Hunger Games is emphatically separated into two classes- the working class and the wealthy class. The working class has nothing and lives in a colorless misery comparable to those living during the Great Depression. The wealthy are a colorful, depraved and repugnant bunch and look like something out of a Mozart musical combined with a gay parade. They don't seem to do anything other than revel in opulence. A whole lot is made in speech about training the candidates and about them gaining sponsors although for the purposes of the movie and the hunger games all this doesn't really amount to much in the end. Our heroine, Katniss is your typical Hollwood powergrl- like a CEO wanna-be with rabies. She treats everyone around her like dirt and we are suppose to admire her for it.Fortunately during the hunger game, Katniss becomes human and develops weaknesses, fear, and a heart. We learn almost nothing about the other participants/districts. One of them seems to house plenty of black people, and their candidates are also the good guys of course. The bad guys are the kids who represent some Sparta-type district that actually prepares their children for this monstrosity. They of course are the blonde blue-eyed devils. Fortunately we don't get to see a whole lot of child-on-child violence except earlier when a video of the games of the previous year is shown. The ""games"" themselves are terribly unfair by virtue of the random choosing of the kids. As a result you have adolescents fighting against children.Performances are overall good in this movie. Stanley Tucci stands out the ludicrous fake TV host of the games' broadcast. His fake ultrawhite over-sized teeth, his nasty laugh, his colored hair that's not fake black-blue but blue blue, is a delightful mockery of the fakeness of the media and its worms with their larger than life personalities.But the star of this movie is the story and how it maximizes social injustice to clarify it to audiences who probably don't understand that it exists. The vile and depraved upper class with its garish taste is not too far from what they look and act like in their gated conclaves. It's not enough that they have it all and that the workers and producers have nothing, they have to humiliate and debase them every year with this absurd ritual that sacrifices 23 children to discourage any future uprisings that could threaten the unjust status quo. There is some romance as well, which is tasteful, and well done and given Katniss' caricaturesque action heroine attitude, downright welcome. We also learn something about the thinking of those pulling the strings of the world. They don't want to offer much to those who have nothing, but a little bit of hope, but not too much. Direction is pretty good, but they could have cut some scenes short, and I'm sure there more background story, perhaps we'll learn about it in the sequels. It's good to see a movie aimed at young people that isn't entirely stupefying.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great action, acting, photography and a well-realized vision","I had not read the book but the one I saw it with did and we both loved it. It is one of three more-than-two-hours long movies I've ever seen where I did not once look at my watch. I do not care much for Woody Harrelson but he and Lenny Kravitz were both terrific in their supporting roles and Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland took the most clichéd characters and each made them special in their own way. As for Jennifer Lawrence, this is one of the few actresses who actually deserves all the hype she's getting. She is terrific. This world creates it worlds well and balances the medieval Roman forum feel with the high-tech gadgets perfectly. I just loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It was good,I saw this movie for the first time and before I thought that it was a stupid subject but while I was watching the movie I found it better and better.It is a good story with very good actors. The romance of the two actors is also so cute.The action is very nice because it is a different story and you never see it in normal action movies.The make-up and the animation are also very good it was perfect with this subject. That makes the movie so good with that little things of perfection.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The most exhilarating movie you will ever see!,"This is the most exhilarating movie I have ever seen in my life. I've sadly never read the books, but my friends whom have told me it was the best film adaptation they had ever seen. We all sat shaking during most parts of the movie due to the suspense. The cast was fantastic and the scenery was stunning. There was a lack of background information regarding each of the 12 districts, which was a slight pity. However the movie had everything from love, betrayal, fighting, sorrow... My expectations for this movie were tremendous. Normally when one has such high expectations, one is let down. Do not fear, you will not be disappointed with The Hunger Games!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A decent adaptation of a teen fiction novel to movie,"When I first picked up a copy of The Hunger Games to read, Mockingjay had yet to be released. There wasn't as huge of hype about the movie at the time. What made me interesting in reading the novel was Stephen king's review of it.I picked up the novel and had a lot of trouble putting it down. I figured, ""this would make a good movie"". A month or two later, the announcement was made that the series would become a movie.Not nearly as many people spend time reading these days, at least in Alberta. The book wasn't extremely long. Adults seem more used to easier reads. I read this book in two sittings because I forced myself to take a break half an hour into the first sitting due to work. I read the entire rest of the book on a weekend evening in about 5 hours, which is still somewhat slow in my opinion.The book series is written with the intention of showing how horrible war actually is. Its designed for teens to enjoy. There's a lot that a teen can legally read which they cannot actually see in a motion picture.I believe it was a good decision to make this fit for pg-13. The movie wouldn't have been so successful as an R rated movie. It wasn't necessary to make into an R rated movie. The book didn't have curses, nor sex scenes, so why go that far if it wasn't there in the first place? The book takes a lot of influence from an Asian gem, which we all know. I do not believe at all that it is a replica. Its quite similar, but follows its own storyline.I'm not going to ruin anything in what happens in the movie or book, so pardon me for being vague.I rate this movie a 7/10 because of the camera work. If it wasn't for the shaky camera, I'd rate it a 9/10.Movies have never and will never be exactly the same as the books. While this isn't a perfect adaptation, its worth watching and enjoying throughout. There were some poor casting choices in my opinion, but the lead role was exactly how I pictured her, same with Peeta. I believe they were a little off on how they presented Gale's character, but this is the movie and not the book.The sequel, Catching Fire, is a much better adaptation in my opinion. I believe there is a lot of potential in making two movies out of Mockingjay.The book is entirely in first person point of view, while the movie shows other character's points of view. Mockingjay is a lot more complex with a lot more room to extend the length. It makes sense to me to make the third book into two movies because it would be hard to follow and miss too much of the book being in one movie made for teens and older.The Hunger Games movie itself I enjoyed once through. I was not interested in re-watching after I saw it in theaters. However, I could take a younger nephew or niece to enjoy this movie.Action movies have become a lot darker in modern times. People always enjoy violence on the screen, especially men and children. Its nice to have a movie like this where we can include a younger audience.There's a ton of haters on the movie, but it does not deserve any rating below 6. Enjoy it for what it is, and rent or buy it for your kids.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A smart, thought provoking and entertaining success.","The Hunger Games gives us a fascinating glimpse into a dark dystopian future society. Here an oppressive government exercises it's power each year by forcing 24 children to fight to the death in a massive battle arena, purely for the sake of intimidating the 12 districts of Panem. This setting stimulates many ethical questions about survival and inequality that resonate across the entire story.This was simply a very well made movie. Despite the occasional dodgy camera angle on the whole it was brilliant. There were aching moments of suspense along side the deeply saddening. All of this was weaved together with the help of a fantastic director and cast. Jennifer Laurence gave a respectable performance as did Josh Hutcherson which made for a strong relationship between Peeta and Katniss. Many of the other characters seemed to be brought to life even better than I expected, my personal favorites being Caesar Flickerman and Effie Trinket. The director also seemed to encapsulate the maddening, over-intoxicating colors and fashion of the Capitol in a way that was just spot on.If you have read the books you may have mixed feelings about this film but I would just advise you to keep an open mind. There are some small areas where bits of the book have been taken away and others where extra scenes have been added to better tell the story and the result is highly enjoyable. The detailed, gripping story is surely the main factor that has brought this film such wide success.All things considered this was a smart, entertaining and though provoking film that sets the series off to an excellent start.The of the must see films of this year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not bad but not as good as many would have you believe,"With Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings opening to both commercial and critical acclaim, it was perhaps inevitable that Hollywood would continue the trend of adapting novels into big screen blockbusters. These adaptations have ranged from the outstanding (Lord Of The Rings) to the downright abysmal (Twilight) with more than a few straddling in between (The Golden Compass, I Am Number Four). Thankfully, The Hunger Games is significantly better than a lot of other young adult adaptations, but not entirely flawless.The story revolves around Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl living in the dystopian district of Panem, who is thrown into a large scale fight to the death with 13 other teenagers from different districts. Those familiar with the Japanese satire Battle Royale, will notice more than a few similarities, with the movie often feeling like a watered down version. Still, it is quite intense fare for a young adult film, with a number of young children engaging in some fairly brutal violence and political allegories not normally associated with teen movies.As is often the case with literary adaptations, it feels like director Gary Ross is trying to fit as much information in as he possibly can so as not to upset fans of the book. Take the opening, which has the unfortunate task of explaining the book's lengthy exposition before we can even begin to think about the games themselves. The problem with this is, as a casual viewer, you are eager to see what all the fuss is about and after just over an hour of build up, it is perhaps inevitable that the games are slightly disappointing. After a suitably brutal opening brawl which claims the lives of a number of participants, we follow Katniss as she survives in the harsh wilderness like a futuristic Bear Grylls.There are some moments of inspiration, such as Ross' decision to almost completely strip the soundtrack during battle sequences, giving them a war movie aesthetic rather than an all action blockbuster. There is also a wonderful moment involving a key characters use of make up, which has to be seen to be believed but throughout the 2 and a half hour runtime, one can't shake the feeling that, given the source material, it could have been so much better.A dark and disturbing teen movie with some interesting political messages about class and the media. A fantastic central performance from Jennifer Lawrence elevates it above the likes of Twilight but it also suffers from trying to appease fans of the book and subsequently feels a little bloated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unoriginal,"The Hunger Games, directed by Gary Ross, is an extremely popular Academy-Award-Winner motion picture about a poor woman named Katniss who lives with her sister. The Hunger Games is a nationally televised event that forces twelve districts to choose one boy and one girl to compete and fight to their death for the prize of living in a mansion and getting free food for you and your family for one year. Katniss is one of the tributes. She has to rely on her hunting skills and sharp instincts to survive and choose survival against love.If you love adventure, romance, action, and suspense, The Hunger Games is a movie for you. It is a well thought out unique storyline and keeps you waiting for the next scene. The acting is amazing and very real. They make you feel like you are apart of the movie. The Hunger Games is a movie for any type of audience. Preferably, girls might be more interested in the movie because they can relate to Katniss much more.One of the negative points about The Hunger Games is that it is not an original movie. The Running Man, another popular motion picture starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is the same storyline instead the main character is a male instead of female. If the storyline was more original, the movie would be more likable. Also, the movie is very predictable and you could guess what was going to happen at the end. The rising action is also very weak. The Hunger Games has some weak points and strong points throughout the movie. The movie is very bland and does not seem to stand out from any other movies.Overall, the movie is decent. It has a balance of great points that stand out and also some weak points that need to be changed. There has been a mix of bad and good reviews. Instead of judging the movie from other people's opinions, everyone should watch The Hunger Games and get their own perspective on the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but....","The movie was awesome. The actors/actresses fit the roles PERFECTLY (cannot stress that enough) and really got the true feelings across to the audience. The biggest thing wrong with the movie, though, was the camera-work. It was very choppy and I couldn't focus...it really was bad. I was also disappointed that they missed very many important (I thought) scenes from the book. (Don't worry, I won't tell you what they are.) If you haven't read the book before you watch the movie, you'll think it's amazing. If you've read the books, you may find out they missed your FAVORITE scene (they missed mine...) I wished they would have had a part 1 and part 2, because there was way too much information thrown into a short period of time. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the books. The movie was great. There's just some things that I didn't like... I'm still buying it when it comes out on DVD though! :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Adaptation,"Adapted from the book of the same name I found myself constantly comparing the book to the film - that is inevitable - and because of that I struggled to separate the book from the film.The film is very faithful to the book (even though it obviously has to cut a few corners in terms of narrative) and this is both to it's credit and to it's detriment. On one hand the book is great and veering away from that would be a mistake...on the other hand if you had read the book then it felt a little bit like a dramatisation of the novel scene-for-scene and as I imagine most of the audience would have already read the book it becomes somewhat predictable. There is also the problem that the romantic stage play that Catniss is part of is very much a battle of conscience for her in the novel but is portrayed as a simple love story in the movie.That being said I liked the way the film was shot and the sombre colour palette used - that was a bit of a surprise. I thought the acting was very good and the realisation of The Capital and the actual arena were skilfully crafted and well thought out - they were almost as I imagined them.It's just that I can recall a few novel adaptations that enhanced their origins; Harry Potter, Misery, Blade Runner, The Shining, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest - all were adaptations that resulted in films that were very watchable whether you had read the book or not...because they were great films. I still remember being shocked, surprised and delighted watching these films even though I knew the story.So although this is a very, very good film it is not the best book adaptation I have ever seen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not truly accurate to the book, but a great movie","The Hunger Games was done really well. I had been waiting for this movie for as long as it was announced it was coming out. A year? I am a huge fan of the books and I know many others who are as well. This is a brilliant reflection on the human species, our society, and our government.I can't stand people who try to compare this to other movies, because this isn't trying to be another movie. This is telling Katniss' and Peta's stories. And the stories of the struggles of the districts.Anyway, the cinematography is great. The make-up and clothes of the capitol are right-on. The differences in the quality of life of the districts and the Capitol are portrayed very well. As far as I can remember, the action at the Games seems about right. I was glad to see that they didn't focus on the gore. That's not really the point. I'm glad there was time spent on Rue and District 11.Now my gripes. Why did you half-ass the CG of the dogs?!!! WHY!? I wanted to see that SO bad! For those who don't know, the bad-ass dogs are actually supposed to be some kind of man-made mutt, where each dog resembles an individual dead tribute. It royally screws with Katniss' head, and she has trouble killing them. And I wanted to see what a make-up artist imagined them to look like. So boooo! I had a couple minor gripes about little things that happened differently in the book. I imagine that they were changed for the movie because they don't have a major impact on the plot or story, and there really wasn't time to develop another character just to give Katniss the Mockingjay pin. Just little things which weren't a really big deal (that I noticed anyway) What carries this movie is the story. The people are being oppressed and controlled by the Capitol. I'm glad Katniss wasn't made up too much in the movie to be too beautiful (with make-up etc). The mood seemed right. Everything was pretty dark and dreary. Everyone seemed oppressed and depressed. That was right on. There were some quick scenes that reveal Katniss' past and that of her family and District. I'm not sure if someone who hadn't read the books would have noticed what they meant. I don't think it was pointed out that the Mockingjay became the symbol of the previous revolution, and Katniss was wearing it during the Hunger Games.I went to see this at IMAX with a bunch of friends. Must of them hadn't read the books. They seemed to enjoy this movie the most: probably because they didn't know how it would end. They had wide-open eyes and big smiles after the movie. Then, we all had a great discussion afterward. Unfortunately, my friends are perpetually tardy, so we had to sit so close, I couldn't fit the entire screen in my peripheral. I'll have to go see it again to appreciate it better.In closing.... Go see this movie. You won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Hunger Games (a let down, even though knew it)","To start with, I can't really say this movie was disappointingly bad. Because I'd already read numerous reviews from friends who had told me how sh*t it was.So instead, I went into this movie trying to see the good in it..Sadly, there wasn't much.The execution is just poor. Whoever directed this should not be put in charge of any sequels if they hope to engage any further.. Edit: oh, it's the Pleasantville guy, well that must be his once off! The acting also is not much better, some of it very forced!This is.. a survival movie, based apparently on a book (part 1 of a trilogy) but at no stage did it really give a sense of urgency, or real fear for one's existence. There was no feel of attachment to any of the characters, including the main pair who made Anakin and Padme's wooden romantic engagement in Star Wars look positively the greatest of all time (please note sarcasm)Some actors of T.H.G, read like a cast list from Marvel movies: Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique from X-Men: First Class) who by the way, acts almost identical in both movies as an outsider.. Liam Hemsworth (ok, not Marvel, but brother of THOR) ;) The two German scientists from Captain America: Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones (the latter, I don't think utters a single word!)A redeeming face amongst the latter cast is Woody Harrelson. I actually sat up and started to take notice somewhat of what was going on, til I realised he wasn't going to get much more.. Another highlight is: Amandla Stenberg.. who plays Rue. Her only other appearance of note so far, being the young ""Cataleya"" in Columbiana. In both she doesn't have enough screen time!The rest are pretty much, no names or TV actors. The guy who played the pervert son in American Beauty, the mother of the Cyclon in Battlestar: Caprica. Oh, Donald Sutherland is in this.. but he's such a by product of the film, that he's out of place, or out of touch with what is going on, muttering through his scenes as his wades through the greenery doing nothing much.. Equally, there's Elizabeth Banks who just looks and plays a ghastly personality.The bloodshed truly feels PG, and the NYPD Blue (showing my age) camera work is so disconcerting.. Used to cover up (in latter Transformers it was lazy CGI) but in this film horrific killings, that were most of the time unseen, and barely heard. Apparently this film is banned in Vietnam due to the violent scenes (wtf?!)IF you want to see real survivor films. These are the ones to see: THE TOURNAMENT, PREDATORS (PREDATOR is on a whole other level) and the ultimate school Japanese thriller: BATTLE ROYALE.Please just read the book, and perhaps wait til someone accidentally hires the movie (acquires it) and you're caught out watching it. Or let your youngin's watch it, as it really is, I guess made for them, and I can see why. Poor Jennifer Lawrence, actually RICH Jennifer.. This film was a BOX OFFICE smash??p.s What the hell is Lenny Kravitz doing in a movie?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
