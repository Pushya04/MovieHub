The only movie my grandfather couldn't finish,"My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable ""I can't watch this"" reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.War is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I've seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Hard to Rate ... been there,"The first 23 minutes of this film is rated at a 12.My good friend and I took our sons, 17 at the time, to see this in a theater. I am a senior military officer who experienced combat in 1967 - 68 - 69. We wanted the boys to see the horror of war, the slaughter.I have had to pack up the personal effects of my comrade to send back to his mother after he was killed in the Viet Nam war. Those of you who have not done this cannot even comprehend.After the opening combat scenes the film was an 8. Well done.War is hell and to those of us who have been there ... well I don't know what to say.Neither of our sons joined the military ... thank God.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fictional yes but combat authenticity was genuinely real.,21 years ago this movie was released and I finally watched it in 2019. I really struggled to watch and I cried and I wept through most of the movie. I did two tours in Nam. This movie was like being back in country. I will never watch it again. It's just eats my guts out.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Actually it's pretty GOOD history,"I know it's fashionable to trash successful movies but at least be honest about the trashing... Pvt. Ryan was fiction but it was pretty good HISTORICAL fiction. The details were well thought out and based on reality.There was nothing stupid about the portrayal of the German army... Rommel DID blunder in his placement of force, The high command DID think Calais was going to be the invasion spot, not Normandy. Hitler didn't wake up until noon on that day and his aides were afraid to wake him. The Rangers did come in right behind the first wave and did take a beach exit by sheer will to get the hell off the beach. The bluffs were the scene of heavy close fighting. The german defenders were mostly Eastern European conscripts from defeated areas. (note that the 2 men that tried to surrender were NOT speaking German). There WAS a young man rescued from interior Normandy after his brothers were all killed. He WAS an airborne trooper (the difference was that he was found by a chaplain and was removed from the front.)The battles inside Normandy were small actions town to town, street to street, house to house. Small actions like taking the radar station happened. Small actions like a handful of men defending a river bridge against odds happened. Small squads of men, formed out of the misdrops banded together ad hoc to fight. There were all enlisted groups and all officer groups. A General did die in the glider assault. FUBAR aptly described much of what happened that day.And there were only Americans in the movie because the Brits and Canadians were many klicks away in a different area... this was Omaha beach. The story was an American one. And Monty DID bog down the advance and everyone knew it. And as for ""American Stereotypes""... well those pretty much define America: my college roomie was a wise-ass New York Jew. My best friend was a second generation east coast Sicilian.  My college girlfriend was a third generation German. My first wife was French and English. I'm Irish, my boss is Norwegian and I work with a Navaho... you get the point?So much for it being bad history. It was in fact an excellent way to let a jaded and somewhat ignorant-of-their-past generation *feel* something of what their grandparents (LIVING grandparents) went through. It is perhaps less important that the details be exact as the feel be right. Even now the details are not fully known or knowable about that campaign... it was too big, too complex and too chaotic to be knowable. There is not even an accurate casualty count of D-Day itself.Now as to the depth of characters. What I saw there was the extraordinary circumstances into which ordinary people were thrown and what happened to them. I saw the things that would mark a generation (I have heard in my elderly male patients sentiments similar to what Cpt. Miller was expressing when he announced his ordinariness) I saw the dehumanization that occurs with war and its mitigation moment to moment, man to man... Cpt. Miller didn't know anything about Ryan and he didn't care... until Ryan revealed his humanity to him with his story of his brothers. Pvt. Reiban was ready to walk out of the situation until he discoverd his captains ordinariness and his humanity. Then he began to look to him almost as a father. Pvt. Mellish rightfully delights in his revenge for all the times he's had to take it because he was Jewish by telling German captives he's ""Juden!"" Nerdish Cpl. Upham can stand alongside his bigger, stronger, braver Ranger compatriots and describe the poetry and melancholy of Edith Piaf's song... then face his cowardice, turn around and stand up in the face of danger and finally demonstrate the dehumanization of the enterprise he was enmeshed in by executing Steamboat Willie... even though Willie had no more choice about being there than Upham did and in other circumstances would have made a friend.I could go on and on with this but enough already. OK, perhaps it is not The Best Movie Ever Made but it is still a good movie. And if one will take the blinders of fashionable negativism off they will see it. Finally, this is not a patriotic story... if anything it is an acknowledgement and thank you to all those old men still out there that did so much for us. To them I say a deep and sincere thank you.",,Anonymous,Drama
Breathtaking,"I have never been affected by a movie the way Saving Private Ryan affected me.  That movie really took me out of my seat in the movie theater and practically had me believing I was really in the battle with John Miller. When somebody was dying in that movie, it felt as if you could almost feel their pain.  Speilberg did an unbelievable job of putting realism into this movie with the camera-work and everything else.  Simply amazing.  An all time great.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Greatest War Movie Ever Made,"It gives a million reason why no one should go to war and one very powerful reason to go to war. It is a soul numbing realistic depiction of what our grandfathers, fathers, uncles, brothers and sons have faced in humanities darkest moments. Not just in WWII but in any war. No one can see this movies without being altered in some way. No one should miss it with the EXCEPTION of those war veterans that have already been there. The surround sound puts the audience in the middle of the battle.Steven Spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of, rather than appalled at the movie for its real life depictions. I suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the President each and every time the question of war comes up. This movie would not stop future wars but I would hope the objectives would be much more clearly defined. I say this as a US Marine.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Numbing experience of SPR redeems baby boomers...,"It's been over a year since first seeing Saving Private Ryan -- it's a worthy effort by Speilberg--his best since Shindler's List by far. You've probably heard about the amount of violence, blood, and gore and that's all true--it's got the Viet Nam movie style violence (and then some) but it's not gratuitous. Were it sanitized like early WWII movies, modern audiences probably wouldn't take it as seriously.The movie has that trademark Speilberg style--the structure is all tied up and unified from beginning to end, the emotional symbols abound, the music swelling when he's working at your emotions, the hand held camera that worked so well in Shindler's List to give you a feeling of participation, camera angles and periods of silence to disorient you (like Shindler), suspense techniques learned from Hitch... It's a movie that stays with you for a period afterwards.Hanks will be the early front runner for Oscar after this flick--Academy members like him AND it IS his best acting job ever. While Speilberg will likely be criticized for attempting to manipulate the audience's emotions while keeping a distance from the inner core of his characters, Tom Hanks reveals a really complex military leader in this story, and does so without overacting--somehow it comes from within. While you may not empathize deeply with many of the platoon, you will still feel something because of the relationship that is formed with Hanks.After the initial set-up, you will have the opportunity to participate in the D-Day operation and experience the horror of it. Those who have been in a real war can comment about how realistic or not Speilberg captures its chaotic horror in this scene.In my case I again feel very lucky that my draft number was high, so I never had to face Nam like many of my classmates. Speilberg reminds us brutally in ""Saving Private Ryan"" that we All have a debt to pay to the brave souls who have sacrificed so much for us. What Tom Hanks does with his performance is to remind us of this debt in a very personal way.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the best war films ever made.,This film is an absolute masterpiece. It shows that war isn't always glamorous. Steven Spielberg won a Best Directing Oscar for his work on this film and the film went on to win four others. It is gritty and bloody and it shows that wars aren't won by weapons but by soldiers. The cast shine as the group of soldiers tasked with finding Private Ryan. Along the way they encounter the harsh truth and real meaning of war. It boasts impressive battle sequences and the stylish cinematography makes the film truly beautiful. The opening beach sequence is possibly the greatest opening scenes in movies. Tom Hanks is spell binding as the commander who has no idea about the harsh truth of war. Overall a truly amazing film.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I have some things to say here.,"Before I saw the film, I have read the comments. Many of You liked Spielberg's new movie. But some of You, mostly from the U.S., write things like ""proud to be an American"" or ""part of American History"" or ""every American should see this movie"".First of all, I want to say that this war must have been pure terror. National Socialism was an indescribably evil disgrace to humanity. Many of You have grandparents who fought proudly against the Germans in World War II, but I (as a 25-year old German) and others have Grandparents who were bombed out of their homes at night and could not get a whole night's sleep ever since. My parents were born during the war, their first baby-impressions were gunshots and explosions - for years! Nowadays, in Germany it still is common to find old, still explodable bombs when building a new house.Second, this is not American history, it is not German history, it is World history - Our history. It is the blackest spot ever to be found in the history of the human race.Third: I don't mean to be rude, but I think that many people have lost the connection to reality. In the first place, making a war movie has two major aspects: Making money (bad) and Reviving History for educational purposes (respectable). But then, feeling history is completely different. In my very neighbourhood, there was a Concentration Camp, only some 53 years ago. I have been to that beach in France, and let me tell You: Just seeing the sea, the sand, the dunes really scared me rigid. Talking with my grandma (she led a baby nursing home in that time), that's history. Just sitting in a movie theatre, listening to SDDS and watching Tom Hanks cry is a different experience.What I want to state here is that there is quite a difference between a movie (may it be as realistic as possible) and real history. This really happened! Millions of people were slaughtered in the most cruel ways! By other people! When I go to my University building, I see the holes in the wall which have been there since the war. They have never been repaired in order to give people something to think about. From exactly that building, Sophie Scholl and her friends threw Anit-Nazi papers into the crowd and got executed only a short time later.I think the film is quite accurate, actually. It is not the most impressive war film I have ever seen (that's  ""The Bridge"" from 1959), but it shows how the war was like. In all aspects. Anyway, how can war films be ""good"" or ""best""? ""Saving Private Ryan"" is an exceptional educational masterpiece, it should be recommended together with ""Schindler's List"", but it is only a movie. It cannot replace reality.So, I recommend this: Watch the movie, everyone! But also think about the real people of any nation that were cruelly murdered in those years, and think about those who lived through it. Even think of those who were with the regime and still walk the earth. Then, book a ticket for Europe, see the Normandie for yourself, see Berlin, see Dresden, see Munich, see the wounds of history. And see that being German is not the same as being a Nazi. After You get home to wherever You come from, I promise, You then will have a different view of reality.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Pro war, sentimental, and manipulative","Saving Private Ryan is an example of a genre of film making that should have died out long ago. Far from being anti war, it is a glorification of war. While the Americans are righteous, the Germans are evil, and Spielberg invites us to enjoy the spectacle of their death. German prisoners should be murdered, (or else they will come back and kill you, so do it to them first).",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A strongly acted, powerful film that is unashamedly brutal!","This is definitely one of the more powerful war films out there, if not the most powerful. I will admit, when I first saw it at school, I found the first half-hour extremely upsetting to watch.The acting is outstanding. Especially from Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, and the music alongside Schindler's List is John William's most haunting score I've heard.It does drag in the middle and the dialogue doesn't always flow as well as it should, but what we have is a historically accurate, extremely well made and directed and unashamedly brutal film. I mean, in the stabbing scene, towards the end, my English teacher had to leave the room. It was like watching Frankenstein's monster tearing out Elizabeth's heart.8.5/10 for a truly emotional and appropriately sombre war-film, that is a little slow at times.

The most realistic harrowing battle scenes ever filmed...,"Steven Spielberg makes a unique motion picture in regards to the D-Day invasion of World War II just in the gritty reality of the detail For more than twenty minutes he revives for us the landing at Omaha beach No one was prepared for how horrific it really was No one understood what was going on: The terror, the chaos, the maelstrom of bullets, the near-deafening explosionsYou really got a sense of what these guys had to go throughWithin that perplexity, the focus settles on six soldiers under the command of Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) after they've survived their terrible hours breaking through the first line of German defense, they're given a strange perilous mission, to find one man, Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper who's somewhere behind German lines For them, it's an abstruse order, but they have to get it doneThroughout the film, Spielberg's attention to detail is amazing For me, the most chilling scene in the movie is the death of an American officer It's one of the most intimate It's also a slightly confusing moment because two German characters resemble each other so greatlyToward the middle, a German soldier called ""Steamboat Willie"" is introduced By the end of the film, he has become the 'bad' German Later in the movie, another German is involved in the final fight He takes part in an exceedingly painful scene of hand-to-hand combat with the American soldier The two German soldiers have similar short haircuts and black uniforms Because they looked so much alike, many of us have believed that they're one character They're not, and the distinction of the two is very significant",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
I Agree: This Is The Best War Movie Ever Made,"Without looking, I am sure other reviewers here have headlined their article ""Best War Movie Ever Made"""" and I agree. However, before briefly discussing the film, let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system, you aren't going to fully appreciate this movie (DVD).It's a great film to start with, and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.The visuals are outstanding, too. I've never seen so many grays, beiges and olive-greens look this good: perfect colors for the bombed-out French city where the last hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers, for the machinery, the smoke-filled skies, etc.My only complaint is the usage of Lord's name in vain 25-30 times, but, hey, when you consider it's tough men in tough times, that's what you are going to hear. In real life, the profanity probably was worse than the film.It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later. It's unbelievable what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.Anyway, language or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, probably the most dramatic in the history of film.As ""entertaining"" as those action scenes were, I found the lulls, if you will, to be even better. Listening to Hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for Private Ryan, was fascinating to me. Hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generation.The most memorable and powerful moment among the ""lulls,"" is the shot early on of the Ryan mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war. Moments later, Harve Presenell, playing Gen. MacArthur, eloquently reads a letter by Abraham Lincoln that is so beautifully written, so profound that it is quoted near the end of the film, too, and I never get tired of hearing it.This is a man's movie, and shows the horrors of war as few others ever have. To say it is ""memorable,"" just doesn't do it justice. It is the greatest war movie ever made....period.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the most outstanding movies ever,"Saving Private Ryan is, without a doubt, the best war movie ever made and one of the best movies of all time. I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie before I saw it. I heard the gore and carnage was too much, and I heard the story and action was great.When I finally did see it, I loved it. The gore wasn't as bad, in my opinion, as everyone said it was. I thought the battles scenes were fantastically done. They were entertaining to watch, but with a certain sadness to it. I also think the moments of reflection among the soldiers was very good too. You got to hear their thoughts about the enemy, the soldiers and the war itself.The acting was great, especially by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks certainly deserved the Academy Award for best actor, even though he did not get it. Matt Damon also did a great job as Private Ryan. Watch for a great cameo-like performance by Ted Danson.The storyline was interesting. Most of all, it showed what the war was like and how horrible it was. Some of the American soldiers were killed before they even entered the battlefield, some before they could even fire back, and some went down in a blaze of glory. Either way, you felt pity for the Americans and hatred for the Nazis.The mission the soldiers were on was to find a single man, Private Ryan, and bring him home, because all of his brothers were killed and he was the last male survivor of the family. You, along with the soldiers in the movie, will always be thinking about whether it is worth it to risk eight lives to save one man. Many things happen through the film that will keep changing your mind about it.If blood, guts and gore bothers you, you really should not watch Saving Private Ryan. Otherwise, I recommend going out and buying it right away. You will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Great WWII war action in France, but too much of the drama is weak","RELEASED IN 1998 and directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Saving Private Ryan"" (SPR) is about the Normandy invasion and its immediate aftermath from June 6-16, 1944. The focus is on a Captain (Tom Hanks) and his men who are commissioned to find a paratrooper (Matt Damon) whose brothers have been killed in action.No one's supposed to say anything bad about SPR. To do so is considered sacrilege, but I have to be honest about what I like and don't like about Spielberg's popular WWII war flick. The initial beach landing (shot at Curracloe Beach, Ballinesker, Ireland) is outstanding, as is the closing half-hour battle at the crumbling village of Ramelle.In between these two great bookends are a few quality sequences, but I didn't find a lot of the drama all that engaging or convincing. The cast is notable (also including Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel, et al.), but the characters never struck me as real for the most part. I've seen the film three times and each time I was too often conscious of the fact that I was watching actors portraying WWII characters in a movie. When you see a truly great picture, by contrast, you completely forget you're watching a movie, e.g. the original ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979).Moreover, too many of the situations in SPR, including the dialogue, simply struck me as unreal or annoyingly treacly. Exhibit A is the moronic dog-tag sequence, which was supposed to be emotionally stirring but just made me roll my eyes. But, like I said, no one can criticize SPR and get away with it, even if the criticism is legitimate. It's like you'll be accused of being un-American or something, which is far from the case with me since I love America; I just can't stand the corrupt government & politicians, particularly the loony DemonKKKraps.In light of my criticisms, I simply don't get why so many praise SPR as ""the greatest war movie ever made."" Again, the opening and ending battle sequences are great but the dubious dramatics leave quite a bit to be desired.I've heard SPR hailed on the grounds that much of it was taken ""verbatim from first-hand, eye-witness accounts of the real Normandy invasion."" I'll take their word for it, but this isn't what I object to. I object to the contrived, sappy, questionable way Spielberg depicted the dramatics and the fact that I was unable to buy the characters as real. The aforementioned dog-tag sequence is just one example, others include the French father's stupefying actions and the forced fight at the radar station and how it's resolved (ooh, the Captain's a high school teacher, whoopee).Nevertheless, there IS a lot of good in SPR that makes it worth viewing. You can't beat the battle sequences, the cast and the convincing WWII visuals throughout.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 49 minutes and was shot in Ireland, England and France.

The message appears to have been the first casualty,"The action scenes in this film are superb - gritty, realistic and plain nasty. However, it remains a source of irritation that such good film making is washed down with an unhealthy dose of flag-waving patriotism. What is the message of this film? That occasionally you find SOMETHING worth fighting and dying for or that it's glorious to die for your country (read Owen for further comments on this)Something else it has led to is a number of American reviewers giving the ""We died to save your a$$es"" speach. This itself is both stupid and untrue - the people who wrote those messages did nothing. America got involved only when it was directly threatened by the Nazis, and not before.I am glad, however, that such views are in a minority from the American postings - It's a pity that the many are tarred by the few.Millions of normal Europeans died in this war - from bombings, shootings, torture, starvation, disease and the Holocaust. This film made only a token attempt to reference this - nothing more.The thin red line was a much better, less commercial film with that very neccessary ingredient - a message - this one remains a catalogue of missed opportunities and a formulaic start and end.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
This is one of the greatest movies ever made.,"To think that this movie did not win Best Picture is a crime. Director Steven Spielberg uses all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever made.Though it's true that this is not the type of movie you want to sit down with the family and eat popcorn, the emotional drive of the picture, the story's poignant messages, and the fantastic acting of the cast draws you into a world that is both dangerous and unpredictable.Spielberg is able to take you into action and make you feel as if you are a participant in the movie and not just a viewer. This is Tom Hanks' best movie he ever did. Forget his performances in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump (though they were also good); he should have received another Oscar for the role of Capt. John Miller, a leader who must act strong in front of his men, but must also hide his emotions from them.  It would have been well-deserved if he won again.I give this movie my highest recommendation. Saving Private Ryan is a movie that makes you realize how life is precious and how honor and duty, though they are deep philosophical concepts that are praised in war, can put you in jeopardy of losing your life for something you may not believe in.",,Anonymous,Drama
One of the Greatest War Movies of All Time,"Together with ""Schindler's List (1993) and ""Platoon"" (1986), ""Saving Private Ryan"" ranks as one of the greatest war movies of all time. Like ""Platoon"" it gives the viewer an ""in the trenches"" experience.Spielberg has hit another home run with this one. The battle scenes are so realistic and gut wrenching that the viewer is left with the impression of what the real battles were actually like. Spielberg conveys the uselessness and futility of war as we follow Tom Hanks and his squad in their search for Private Ryan following a devastating battle on D-Day.Spielberg's two World War II masterpieces, Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan should be required viewing at the high school level in order to instill in our youth a sense of the sacrifices that were made over a half a century ago in order to preserve our freedom.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Horrors of War,"There's violence and there's violence. With the huge numbers of personal reviews of this movie, I'm hard pressed to add much. The first half hour affected me like no other in recent years. I wondered as the boys threw up on the amphibious carriers whether they were seasick or scared beyond belief. When one uses the expression ""cannon fodder"" so casually, do we realize that this means the second wave makes it's way to the beach over the dead and dying bodies of the first wave, like ants sacrificing themselves to ford a puddle. The ones that get through, get through because there are only so many bullets and so many people. They are exposed, disoriented, helpless--they have no place to go but ahead. I will be haunted forever by the soldier searching, then finding his dismembered arm in the carnage. I will remember those trying to get above water, only to be cut down below the surface. If anyone has a heart, his or her attitude toward war should never be the same. How can we who have never been there have a hint of what it must have been like. Like Schindler's List on the Holocaust, this should be a training film on war.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Best War Movie out there.,"Saving Private Ryan is a military movie based during World War II. The movie starts with the invasion of Normandy at what is now known as D Day. Captain Miller, who is played by Tom Hanks, leads his troops onto the beaches of Normandy against the Germans. Once they are able to take the beach, they learn of story of Private James Ryan. James and his other four brothers are scattered throughout Europe battling in World War II. The United States Headquarters learns that all of James's brothers have been killed in action, leaving James the only sibling to survive. The United States Military learns that his mother will be receiving all news that all three of his brothers have been killed in action. In a plot to give his mother some type of comfort, the Military sends Captain Miller and his troops on a hunt to find Private Ryan and tell him what had happened and to get him back home.The theme of the film is courage. Throughout the film the soldiers show tremendous courage in their journey from the beginning until the end. The soldiers had to go through one of the most horrific and bloody battles from World War II and had to show tremendous courage to make it and take the beach. After they took the beach they had to go on a journey in order to find Private Ryan. They had to search throughout Europe to find Ryan while going through several battles and their own battles with each other. They lost many men including Corporal Caparzo. All of those men lost, just so that they could get Private Ryan and send him home to his mother.Lighting and sound effects were two major techniques used in the movie to enhance and capture the attention of the viewer, and to create a very lifelike impersonation of what those scenes were like in real life. When Caparzo was shot by a sniper the scene was very dark, it was raining and there was little visibility for the soldiers due to fog. The surround sound of the rain made it very intense and made it feel as if you were right there. The sound of explosions going off at every corner captures the moments of war that make it horrible to be in. It makes you after these scenes make you think to yourself what it would really be like in a war like that and if that's how it really was.Saving Private Ryan is one of the best military movies of all time. The courage that these men faced with themselves and to find someone that none of them knew was extremely heroic. They made it possible to help with a grieving mother who had lost not one but three sons in the heat of battle in World War II. This movie is a must see so that we can try and understand what these young men and women had to go through and sacrifice in order for us to live in freedom.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A Heart-Wrenching, Gutsy War Movie That Left Me Speechless!","Alright, folks, gather 'round because I just watched ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and oh boy, do I have some thoughts! Directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg and released in 1998, this movie is a jaw-dropping, heart-pounding, and tear-jerking depiction of World War II. Let me tell you, it's like no other war film I've ever seen.So, the story is about a group of soldiers, led by Captain John Miller (played by the ever-impressive Tom Hanks), who are on a mission to find and bring home this guy, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon). This poor dude has already lost all his brothers in the war, and now he's the last one left.Now, let me tell you, the opening scene is an absolute doozy! It's a no-holds-barred, in-your-face portrayal of the D-Day invasion of Normandy. It's intense, gory, and downright horrifying, but it's also incredibly gripping. I was on the edge of my seat, eyes glued to the screen, heart pounding in my chest.Tom Hanks is, as always, a freakin' treasure. He plays the role of Captain Miller with such depth and vulnerability that it's impossible not to feel for the guy. And the rest of the cast? Top-notch! They bring these soldiers to life with such raw emotion and camaraderie that you can't help but root for them.What I loved most about this movie was the balance between edge-of-your-seat action and heart-wrenching character development. I was totally invested in these characters, their stories, and the friendships that were forged in the crucible of war. Spielberg nailed it, showing us the devastating emotional toll war takes on the human soul.Oh, and let's not forget the phenomenal cinematography and sound design! The camera work is chaotic and disorienting, perfectly mirroring the confusion and terror on the battlefield. And the sound? Let's just say you might want to make sure your neighbors are cool with the sound of gunfire and explosions because it's that intense!Sure, ""Saving Private Ryan"" has its flaws. The pacing can be a bit slow here and there, and some of the characters' motivations could be fleshed out a bit more. But honestly, these are just minor gripes in an otherwise spectacular film.In conclusion, if you haven't seen ""Saving Private Ryan"" yet, what the heck are you waiting for?! This movie is a gut-wrenching, heart-stopping, and unforgettable experience that'll leave you speechless. It's a must-watch, folks, so grab some popcorn, brace yourself, and get ready for one heck of a ride!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
a MUST see!!!!,"i first saw this movie on T.V. one night with my father, but only saw bits and pieces. I decided to rent it one night and watched the whole thing in my basement. From the start to the finish i thoroughly enjoyed the movie.i had seen a couple other world war two movies, but none of them compared to this. it was interesting how Spielberg made everything look like it was back then, with the costumes, weapons and scenery!!! overall, this movie seemed like one of the best out there, and i personally think it's spielbergs best. If you haven't seen it yet, then i HIGHLY recommend you go out and rent it some time. It's a great movie and definitely worth watching!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not as great as you've heard,"When I first saw this film at the cinema I was, like everyone else in the world, blown away by the opening scenes and then mostly entranced by what followed. Upon re-watching it these years later, the overall effect has been lessened by familiarity and, possibly, by being Speilberged out after watching Munich last week! The battle scenes are still excellent  visceral, terrifying and all too real  conveying the calamitous confusion of war in a way seldom matched in the movies. When the action slows down, so does the film, and this often leaves you feeling a little disinterested as the characters lack of back-story and overly obvious attempts at making them look good (Woo! I've saved a child! Boo! I've been shot!) seem to jar with the realism attained elsewhere. It's still a cracking film though, and the weaker bits have actually stood up better than the strong bits in my opinion (although maybe I'm just more tolerant of schmaltz as I get older).",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"wow ... if all the movies were showing the war that way, it would be great !","I really liked this movie ! the realism was extreme, what is, I think a good thing. I do not like Spielberg (since i was 14-15 yrs old anyway). I think this guy would be better in doing commercials for TV than making movie - just my humble opinion. But if we forget some flaws the movie is pretty good ! T. Hanks was also very good in it ! he got my respect.now, some stuff was bothering :near the beginning, why spielberg was making the little french girl say "" i don't like those american soldiers ! -sob- "" Are those US dudes will stop one day to think that the french are genetically antiamerican ? that's ridiculous ! I hate set ideas !The german soldiers look dumb and wanting very eagerly take some US slug in the map ! Come on, guys ! The germans are just there to be shooted, they act stupidly what cost them their life, they have no survivng instinct ... i don't buy it !The landing scene seemed ended a little too fast and easily to match the reality i think (IMHO)Of course, there may be a little too much US patriotism for the average european viewer, we are not used to it anymore in our countries (self-glorification, i mean) but after all it's an american movie and they did change the fate of Europe and the world, so ... let them do it.anyway good movie, i give it a 8/10.= you should at least see it once ! >",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

the best World War 2 Movie of All Time,"This movie will rank in the top 100 movies of all time for years and years to come. Why? Because it helps shows war with real decency. No one would want to watch a movie with only killing, blood and gore. No one really does. This movie manages to let us, the viewers, watch virtually a firsthand take of what veterans went through.The acting was phenomenal. Tom Hanks was at his best yet, with superb realism which he displayed. Good job to others: Tom Sizemore, Edward Burn, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, and of course Vin Diessel.The Director: Steven Spielberg directed the best movie he ever made. This movie was unbelievably realistic. I know that throughout this movie, I did not and could not possibly think about anything that might take me away from the movie. In fact, the whole time I imagined that this was not a movie, that it really occurred.The music director: John Williams made one of the best of Alltime. The beautiful piece: Hymn to the Fallen Soldiers raises the goosebumps from your arms. Extremely good job with that. Revisiting Normandy and others also were profoundly beautiful. The sound was amazing. The sound of the tanks rolling, warfare, bullets under water, etc. really super sized this movie. The sound tanks in this movie got me scared.This movie clearly should have won best movie, and best actor.I loved it and watch it once every month, which I simply can not elude.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The most amazing movie I have ever seen.,"Up until this day, there had never been a time where I was awestruck or shocked or amazed after seeing a movie. Never. Then, I saw Saving Private Ryan. This movie, without a doubt, is the best movie I have ever seen.Saving Private Ryan is a very accurate presentation of World War 2. In a lot of the parts, I felt like I was actually there. It was all thanks to Spielburg's camera-work, which showed some scenes of the movie from the view of a soldier. I felt like I was running along the beaches of Normandy. I felt like I was with them in the final battle (won't reveal specifics). That's how good it was! Now, even though this movie is really good, it is not for the faint of heart. The first scene of this movie (D-Day) contains gratuitous amounts of violence and gore. They do not hold back on the violence. So, unless you think you can handle it, I would not recommend seeing this movie, because it does have some very disturbing moments. Another thing they do not hold back on is swearing. If soldiers shouting out the f-word constantly doesn't appeal to you, then you might want to skip this movie.Besides all of that, this is a great film! I can't think of anything wrong with it at all. I would definitely recommend this movie (if you can handle the gore and language).",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great film!,"I can not understand those who view it as an 'America win the War' movie. That is not the point of most of the war movies out there. Yes, they may use American actors and show American fighting, but look past that and see the terrifying experiences of war and the fear of the people back home who suffer the emotional trauma. 'Saving Private Ryan' I felt gave a visual look at war, it gave the best feeling of what war would be like that any movies have given, but I don't think that any movie ever will be able to to give the exact fear that is within the people when they are in the middle of a battlefield.An excellent movie, dignified, moving and intelligent (not a word used with many Hollywood movies) acting with a director that has shown everyone how it SHOULD be done.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This would have been the best movie ever....,"...if Spielberg had resisted the urge to tack a big set piece on to the last 30 minutes.Imagine watching the same movie except this time it ends at the point that they catch up with Private Ryan.Up to that point Spielberg had shown such restraint and subtlety it was disappointing to see it had been thrown away for a silly crowd pleaser. The first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan clearly demonstrates the sheer horror of war as well as the lives that are wasted in a way that no previous movie had even attempted.The last 30 minutes on the other hand seem to follow the usual approach, glamorising the whole experience with all the usual heroics and bittersweet sentimentality that we have seen in a thousand war movies before.Still having said that, this is still an excellent movie and is well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Inhumanity brought to life to save humanity,"D-Day. Operation Overlord. What we say here cannot do justice to what they did on that day. Tom Hanks and his patrol must recover Private James Ryan before his mother gets her fourth flag delivered by an Army chaplain. It all makes perfect, illogical sense to kill many to save one.After surviving the Normandy landing, Hanks is volunteered to put his men in the line of fire again and again. Just to save one man.Or is it?A bridge is saved, a town is secured, a bigger battle is won..All because Hanks saved one shoe for one horse...Beautifully realistic to make the atrocities of war invade, assault, and overpower all five senses. You feel the bullets whizzing past your head. You see the man looking for his arm after it was blown off is shoulder. You smell the burning hatred for the Nazis as one US soldier yells to his comrades ""Don't shoot them..let them burn.""It is too much to watch..but you have to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

I was 14 and when I was going to turn 17 I was determined to join the army - u know, spend the summer with friends, learn new things, meet new people, and most importantly be a soldier for my country.All that changed in the first 5 minutes of this movie. I have never had a movie impact me so much. To all of you who are so full of yourselves that the only things you can say are: ""So typical of American movies, always making movies about Americans"" or ""Typical Spielberg, displaying the allies as the good guys and portraying the Germans as the bad guys."" You people make me sick. Forget about your prejudice towards America, just watch the movie and understand the message about war that its trying to bring out! And for those of you who can honestly sit there and feel sorry for the portrayal of the Nazis, you are the reason I wanted to join the army in the first place, to put people like you in your place.Anyways, terrific movie, definitely set the new standard for war movies.

Great Opening But Downhill From There,"You can't fault the production or the acting. So why does this film fail to live up to its promise?I think it is perhaps the episodic nature of the story. Each episode is fine but they don't add up to something greater. Instead the initial power of the film, built on those opening scenes on Omaha beach, is gradually dissipated.The great war films - Paths of Glory, The Dam Busters, Glory, All Quiet of the Western Front - have a driving force in their plot that does not let you go.But then again - 1917 is certainly a great war film and is also episodic. But the director keeps us hooked in a way that Spielberg does not manage here.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"amazing battle scenes, subpar story","I went to see Saving Private Ryan twice in the theatre. I was very impressed the first time I saw it, and the battle scenes were so haunting that I felt it would be worthwhile going again. While I again enjoyed them, they obviously did not have the same impact as when seen for the first time and this caused me to give greater attention to the remainder of the film. It didn't hold up well.I feel it would have been best for Spielberg to have begun this film right off in the boat. No advance warning, no sentimentality. It would have been perhaps the most amazing first scene in cinematic history. But he had to overdo it. The first graveyard scene can be accepted, though it is undesirable. But the second was insulting, not just to me, but to the film itself and the message it had attempted to convey. He can understate well, as the scene in which Mrs. Ryan is told of the fate of her sons proves.(The rule which is so often broken by film makers today is don't tell, show. But they are so used to talking down to the audience that it is seen as desirable and normal. I see it as manipulative and condescending).It also seemed as if I could actually see the seams in the movie, the transition from one scene to the next. It was obvious that it was _written_. Yes, of course, all screenplays are written. But a truly good film can draw you in to the point where it IS reality. SPR did not do that for me. I'm sure there has already been sufficient comment on the stereotypicality of the characters. And of course the scene in which there is an argument over whether or not to take the child along with them.There is a sense in which films like this are protected from artistic judgment because it is felt that the message they are conveying is so important. I believe this is part of the reason it has received as much praise as it has. While the battle scenes and cinematography are truly magnificent, those things alone are not enough for a film to be considered the greatest film of all time, nor even the greatest war film of all time.",,Anonymous,Drama
Quite possibly the finest war film ever made....,"One of, if not THE single greatest movie Steven Spielberg has ever made (the only other motion picture even in the running is ""Schindler's List,"" his other dramatic epic set in WWII). I just saw it on TCM for a 3rd or 4th time (I had originally seen this in a giant-screened movie theater at its premiere), and I'm always moved by the final scenes. First, a dying Capt. John Miller (played by Tom Hanks) pulls in Pvt. Jimmy Ryan (played in the June 1944 scenes by a young actor, Matt Damon) to his lips to whisper his last words in his ear, ""Earn this!"" Then Director Spielberg morphs the 25-year-old face of Damon into an elderly face at the French cemetery for U. S. war casualties 50-60 years later, where James Ryan emotionally hopes aloud that he's been a good enough man over the lifetime of his extended family to be able to say to the Captain that he's ""earned it."" I never don't cry at this scene, and for this, along with numerous other reasons (not the least of which is the handheld camerawork in the opening Normandy beach landing scene done by Director Spielberg himself), I reiterate my firm belief in this film's sublime greatness!

Spielberg Takes Us To War,"The genius of Steven Spielberg is that he always knows exactly where he wants to take his audience, and then takes them there. If he wants to tug at our heartstrings, he'll make us fall in love with a brown and wrinkly space visitor we might otherwise find grotesque. If he wants to make us inch the blanket up over our eyes, he'll crank up the grim orchestral music and put us face-to-face with a toothy Great White. And if he wants us to truly understand an entirely different kind of horror, he'll show us small children leaping into a pool of outhouse waste to escape their murderous Holocaust captors.Spielberg continues what he does best with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, a film so graphic in its Second World War battlefield depictions that many veterans have called it the closest thing to being there. The explicit scenes of gushing arteries, severed limbs and faceless corpses come fast and furious, numbing us into the reality of the setting. In fact, if we didn't know Spielberg as a serious artist with noble objectives, we might be tempted to call him a shock artist obsessed with blood and guts and gore.But we do know about Spielberg. We know he would not take us down such a rocky road without a reason. In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the obvious rationale is to help us understand not where he's coming from, but where the men we will ultimately spend nearly three hours with are coming from. It's in this hell on earth that Cpt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his small group of soldiers (fine actors like Edward Burns, Tim Sizemore and Barry Pepper among them) must not only survive with sanity intact, but carry out orders. And not all of those orders make sense at the time, if ever. Case in point, Hanks and his men are sent to locate one Pte. James Ryan (Matt Damon). Pte. Ryan is no POW, but a soldier still serving somewhere within the vast U.S. Forces -- if he's still alive, that is. During the Second World War, with a communication system that is a technological dinosaur by today's standards, it's a mission ordered said than accomplished.The mission is a tough sell not just logistically, but emotionally. Pte. Ryan is sought so he can be sent home to his mom, who has just lost her three other sons virtually at once. As he himself admits, Pte. Ryan has displayed no more courage than his fellow soldiers. Why should he get to leave? Indeed that question crops up in the minds of Hanks' soldiers. Why is one man's life worth risking those of a group of men? they ask. It's an interesting angle for a film about heroes. We often think of soldiers doing the job with no questions asked, happy to put their lives on the line for their fellow GI. We forget they are rational humans.And therein lies one of the biggest strengths of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It's a very human story told in extreme circumstances. It covers all the traditional bases -- inner turmoil, terror, carnage -- but has a level of sophistication absent from most other war films, particularly those inspired by The Last Great War. Hanks isn't Patton, but a schoolteacher who secretly cries at the enormity of it all. The enemy fighters don't have horns, but uniforms and feelings just like the Americans. The soldiers are heroes, but reluctant ones.Spielberg is a master at telling the story of war and men. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is not his best, but it certainly comes close.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

America saves the world - again!,"Very good film - the landing sequence at the start was phenomenal. The acting was of a uniformly high standard. A couple of things spoiled the film a bit for me.The Germans are treated as 'Nazis', even when most Wermacht soldiers were just serving their country like everybody else. Also they seemed to be targets that got mown down in droves and were generally portrayed as less than human. I thought that went out in cinema a few years after the war ended.Finally the only mention of the other allies is one disparaging comment about Montgomery's failure in front of Caen. Firstly he was facing most of the German armour that was dug into strongpoints, and secondly on D-Day and for a period after the British and Canadian troops out numbered the Americans. I wouldn't normally bother but Americans seem to view these films as historically accurate representations.With the release of U571 this trend is getting even worse. The capture of the Enigma machine was carried out by a British destroyer crew - before America even entered the war!The new Colditz movie is following this path. There were very few American POW's held there, and none of those escaped by the war's end.",,Anonymous,Drama

The perfect war movie..,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of those movies you can't believe didn't win the picture Oscar. That didn't stop it though from reaching such a huge audience and touch the lives of millions. The movie has one of the best introductions ever put on screen. The attack on D-Day is immensely powerful and painfully well directed. Steven Spielberg knows exactly how to make this movie strong and action-driven while focusing on the psychology on the characters and the cruelty of war.The movie is about 8 men searching for a soldier by the name of James Ryan (Matt Damon), who's the last of four brothers still left alive. After the attack of D-Day most of the soldiers still suffer the war syndrome and seem very doubtful of finding one person in a whole war-zone. Back at home, Ryan's mother gets a letter about three out of four of her sons dying in war, and begs the soldiers to find her last one.It's a beautiful film that depicts war as it should be. Vicious, disgusting, violent, heartbreaking, unfair, and tragic. Spielberg's use of the hand-held camera is almost breathtaking, as he gets right into the action and swings left and right to create a sense of realism and panic. His incredible editing and beautiful cinematography is unforgettable and is strongly influential.Tom Hanks gives an incredible performance as Captain John Miller, a dedicated and loyal soldier who's on the verge of losing his mind. The pressure from being a captain and enduring the worst attack in history sends him in mental torture, trying to covering his pain and suffering from the rest of the soldiers.The story doesn't focus on the heroic aspect, but rather the truth about war. Spielberg knows that even though you get to know the characters, they have a chance of dying. There is a unique subtlety in that these characters seem to have the drive to save private Ryan so they could go home.Definitely one of the best directed films in a long time, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a bright gem in recent film-making. Robbed of the Picture Oscar, the movie is a true representation of D-Day and post D-Day. It's a movie that inspires above all else.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
An Incredible Experience,"A Massive Success
When Saving Private Ryan originally released in late summer of 1998, it was met with a massive amount of critical acclaim, even winning 4 Academy Awards . No movie before had ever come so close to capturing the horrific nature of modern warfare on screen. Even now, twenty-two years later, the film is still considered to be unparalleled in terms of both the authenticity of its battle sequences, as well as the grand scale that they are depicted on. Today I want to talk about why this movie is so beloved by both the veterans who have served our country, and the everyday people who never have: to explore in depth why so many consider Private Ryan to be one of the greatest achievements in American filmmaking, and to reflect on why movies like this have a place in our society.Reverence for The Fallen
When watching Ryan for the first time, there were several things that immediately stood out to me. The very first image you see is of the American flag waving about in a slight breeze. This serves to remind us that without what we are about to see, life as we know it would be vastly different, and that without the knowledge of how much we went through to attain our freedom, we run the risk of forgetting the price we paid, and the lives lost in pursuit of that freedom. Instead of jumping immediately into the opening landing sequence, we are given a chance to watch a veteran walk about slowly in a graveyard with thousands of tombstones; a less personal look at the horrors we are about to experience. Before the movie was released, a select group of surviving veterans were taken to screen the film. Not many of them were able to finish. In fact, almost 75% of them walked out within the first 20 minutes, all of them unable to handle what they were seeing, as it reminded them so strongly of what they had experienced more than 50 years prior. As sad as this is, it speaks to the films ability to communicate the awful reality of war.No Holding Back
And man, does this movie show that reality.Within the first half hour of this 3 hour long film, you come to understand what Spielberg was setting out to do with Saving Private Ryan. The second these brave men land on Omaha Beach, they are absolutely annihilated by enemy fire as they desperately run to try and find cover. Men dive over the sides of their boats and end up drowning in an attempt to escape the withering, laser-like accuracy of the evil above them, situated inside impenetrable concrete bunkers. We see a soldier calmly walk over and collect a severed limb. We see a man blown in half, blood pouring out of a massive chest wound. Hundreds upon hundreds of brave soldiers lose their friends to the merciless machine-gun fire. But they keep going. They keep gaining ground. They will not be stopped whatever the cost, because they are fighting for something bigger than themselves. But the horrors continue. A soldier is relieved to find out that a near fatal round merely grazed his helmet, only to be immediately shot in the head when he takes it off to inspect it. Two field medics try desperately to rescue a wounded soldier, only to fail when the man is hit in the head even after their attempts to help him succeed. No other film about war has quite reached the same level of intensity and realism depicted in this sequence. And even as the film continues on and creates fictional stories, the heart and soul of its mission is to depict the incredible consequences of armed warfare, and it does so flawlessly.Incredible Filmmaking
But while noble intentions are respectable, they don't always signify a great movie. Thankfully, Saving Private Ryan succeeds on the front of expert moviemaking. The cinematography is absolutely stunning to look at. Wide shots lend a sense of epic scope, while close ups and slow motion in the opening and closing battle sequences serve to highlight the claustrophobic feeling of combat. Beautiful vistas are never far away from the eye of the camera, and neither are scenes where grit seems to seep through the edges of the screen. Spielberg utilizes a handheld camera in certain sequences to add to the shaky, stressed feeling of terror that the soldiers no doubt possessed. The weapons, equipment, and tactics throughout are totally authentic as well, adding to the sense of immersion. The sound design only adds to the phenomenal presentation, with extremely realistic effects. Every time a grenade goes off, a cacophonous explosion will make you flinch, and the gunfire (especially in the opening sequence) serves to heighten the tension even more. Because of this, Ryan won the Academy award for ""Best Sound Editing/Mixing."" The writing too helps to lend a sense of authenticity to the dialogue. The acting in the film is absolutely spot-on, and won Tom Hanks the Academy Award for ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" for 1998.A Serious Subject
Along with heaps of critical praise, Saving Private Ryan was also criticized by some as being ""Too violent."" Allow me to reiterate that this is not the do-a-roll-while-shooting-a-guy-in-the-eyeball glamorized violence of something like the John Wick movies, but realistic war violence on a realistic scale depicting real battles. Yes, the movie may be rated for ""Intense prolonged realistically graphic sequences of war violence"", and that is because it is realistically graphic and intense. The intensity of the combat depicted is meant to make the viewer appreciate the monstrous cost of the lives lost at the allied beachhead, and I think it does so effortlessly.In Summary
Saving Private Ryan is a modern classic, depicting war how it is while breathing life into a time period that is often hard to capture on film. While not to be encountered lightly, Private Ryan is an exemplary showcase of modern day American filmmaking, and shall be appreciated for decades to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Timeless piece of art.,"I remember when I watched the infamous opening scene of the Omaha beach invasion in my Grade 10 civics class in the spring of 2019, and seeing and hearing the reactions of classmates around me. It's a moment I'll never forget, as much as I have finally seen the movie in it's entirety recently. Seeing such a beautifully grim but brutally realistic action sequence put to film awestruck me, and I always had a burning desire to see this movie.Well after playing a few classic Call of Duty campaigns and ultimately gathering more knowledge (and humbling myself) about WWII, I can say this was a tremendous experience. Yes this film has some inaccuracies, but the pure heart, passion and history radiating from this production turned me into a huge fan of war movies, and being keen about learning of war and the sacrifices of our soldiers more than before.I always stood with everybody in the Remembrance Day assemblies in school and I knew of the sacrifices of my fellow citizens in participating in the wars of my country's past, however it wasn't until my latest binge of WWII related medias which truly exposed my eager mind to the terrors of combat, and the ultimate price our world had to pay for our human conflicts. And this amazing film is one of the things that has helped me formulate my utter respect and gratefulness for every man or woman that sacrifices their humanity and potentially their life to fight for victory.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Big Movie,  Little Mind.","""  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN   ""I thought that this Movie was going to be a masterpiece. Topping those great Anti-War films of ""Apocalypse Now"" ""The Boat"" and ""All quiet on the Western Front""But alas!  What am I to expect from America?  The Truth? NEVER!Yet another great, expensive war film, where the Germans fight like Italians,  TOTALLY arrogant to anyone else.  I mean HONESTLY an American flag at the start and at the end.  Showing the American and French flags.  The ENGLISH and CANADIANS DID land on Normandy too.  The only reference to anyone else is an insulting comment about Monty.The Germans may have suffered a bit more on the eastern front than the Americans in France, but that doesn't matter because they were on the wicked side.This is the kind of film simply made to win another Oscar for Speilbergs already crowded shelf.  Not a ground breacker, not a truthful film. NOT even historically correct!!1.  Radar was a TOTAL secret.  No American privates or captains would have ANY idea of what Radar was.2.  Germans, especially those of the SS, would NEVER be stupid enough to attack a ruined village with Tanks first. It was common military knowledge for both sides.3. The P-51 D mustang, which blows up the Tiger Tanks on the bridge,  were NEVER tank destroyers, they were only used as long range bomber escorts during the invasion.  The only Tank destroyers being employed at that time were BRITISH.  NOT AMERICAN. So of course the Americans would take out this imperfect feature.Frankly, if you're American, you can go get your gun an' feel patriotic once again, as you have done with ""The dirty Dozen"" ""Where Eagles Dare"".If you're not American, avoid this, and stick to ""The Boat"" for your WWII viewing.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS,"A large-scale military drama showing all aspects of human existence in the conditions of world chaos without a transparencies.Attention to small details, historically accurate - such as the stunned bodies of fish on the shore, shown during a fast-paced amphibious landing operation on the shore. A frankly shown meat grinder inherent in clashes of troops. Emotions of living beings, of which there are few people left, attacks of religion, every second of hope, which is interrupted by a bullet that pierces through the head of a soldier who has just planned further actions.In between these are glimpses of the human from the conditions of the peaceful existence of the headquarters of the troops, from where the humane order comes, to resolve which is a moral dilemma, the 'trolley problem'.Tom Hanks, ingeniously conveying the emotion of the captain, who is entrusted with this task with a group of people, different in character and constitution, in the revelations of evening dialogues revealed through spoken speeches.Moral dilemmas throughout the film, the solution of which is either according to Bentham, or according to Hegel, which can lead to various consequences, but the essence of a biological being in an extreme situation is simple - 'either I, or Me'.Camera work, editing, sound accompaniment - immersing in the atmosphere, transmission through color shades - plot twists, everything is appropriate and accurate.The motivation and goal setting of many key characters is clearly conveyed.Symbiosis of animal and human - everything is intertwined into a single concept.

The Movie That Shows What War Is About,I believe that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was one of the best war movies ever made because it shows what war is really about.  I have seen tons of movies where violence is portrayed as a cool shoot-em up blow-em up thing.  This movie has a lot of violence but shows the reality of what happened a half -century ago and the horrible brutality of war.  The actors were fabulous in recreating the war.  Not to mention the battle scenes were perfect.  Steven Spielberg has done an excellent job of recreating the events of Omaha Beach in the first 24 minutes of the film.  This movie shows war in its most truthful sense.  It made me stop and think just how many people died horrible deaths to save our country.  It made me want to cry like few movies do.  This movie is the closest you will get to seeing what life was like during WWII.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
What can I say,"This movie literally has you crying before it's 5 minutes in. From then on, it shows you raw, unrestrained war for the next 2 hours and 45 minutes. You see the brutal violence and the emotional horror, but you also see the men who fought in WWII, who gave their lives to defend freedom. The movie gives you such a real look into each soldiers life that it feels like you know each one personally. The entire cast gives amazing performances, and Spielberg does his thing to make yet another masterpiece.I don't have a personal story involving me or a family member regarding the events of this movie like many people do, so I can't relate to it in that way. I just watched this movie and was captivated from scene one until the credits rolled.Thank you to everyone involved in the making of this film.

Most important film in this genre!,"Book-ended so deftly with genuine and heart felt honesty, this film is one of Spielberg's most important. And is definitely, in my view, the most important and impacting War genre film ever put to celluloid. From the gritty, in your face representation of what the Normandy landing was like -to which veterans in theaters often had to clear out for that harrowing opening, such that the depiction struck too real- to trudging into the unknown throughout war-torn France that Hank's character and his band of brothers face; this movie hits a combination of humanity and the brutality of War that everyone should see in their lifetime. Not for the violence of it but to honour the men who laid so costly a sacrifice.A technical feat of filmmaking, as well as respecting the lives and the bravery of young men in battle against a threatening foe (Hitler's Germany), this tributes their legacy in a truly human way. Without cliche, without glorification, nor a hint of faux emotion. John Williams score drives this humanity throughout every scene, especially in the transitions to the next sequence of events. And Spielberg guides these performances with precision to deliver unforgettable, and harrowing moments throughout.Thoroughly deserved Sound Design, Editing, and Director Oscars for Saving Private Ryan! A masterpiece. Enthralling. Engaging. Relentless in bursts, but will give you a handful of breathers and close on a tragic, if not reflective ending that shows the cost of War.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Saving Mister Spielberg,"Visually, the best WW2 movie. In other ways, far from the best. The movie is loaded with errors and falls into demonizing the German soldier and praising the American. A few examples, far from the reality the combat scenes show the Germans acting like cattle without ANY strategy at all they just run and shout, one funny part is the behavior of the German tankers, they drive in a ruined village in a VERY narrow street, like they have never heard of ambush! -One starts to think if the script writer has ever heard ofthe capabilities of the German panzer crews, SS-Captain Michael Wittmann attacked and destroyed 48 armored fighting vehicles alone in a single action! The most absurd part is the -""Macgyver/Rambo scene""-when Capt. Miller and friends start to throw the mortar grenades slaughtering a few dozen Germans. The most unforgivable error is that there were NO SS-units with Tiger tanks operational in Normandy at this point of time. This movie is way overestimated.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Intense, Heart Wrenching, & As Authentic as it Gets.","Private Ryan is the best war movie to come around. Hacksaw Ridge, Dunkirk, and 1917 are all quite great, but they are nothing to Private Ryan, which redefined the genre and has made the formula for every modern war film. What amazes me is that Spielberg continues to be a master of technical filmmaking. He makes the impossible seem entirely possible. But he continues to be underrated for the way he can create emotion out of his audience.This movie makes you care so much about so many characters, which frankly many of them don't get all that much screen time; he makes characters such as Private Jackson or Cavarzo stand out with the few minutes they can shine on screen.I truly believe that this movie was certainly robbed of Best Picture at the Oscars, and that Tom Hanks delivering a completely authentic performance was also missed by the Academy.This movie brutally shows the horror of war, and continues to be the landmark of the war genre. It'll be shown in school for years as a firsthand look into what these people go through. It's pretty much a flawless war movie,",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Typical, manipulative, sentimental Spielberg.","The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is passable entertainment which, if you know anything about The 'Berg's intention for the film, was not the point. This movie was released to overwhelmingly consistent reviews which frequently referred to it as ""one of the best war movies ever made"". Imagine my disgust when I saw it...The opening battle is undeniably brilliant in terms of putting you in the middle of the action/horror, but it relies solely on Spielberg's ability to push the right buttons and is almost totally ineffective on second viewing.Personally, I knew this film was going to be a disaster pretty early on. To be precise, I knew it when, in the midst of this mind-blowing battle sequence, Spielberg thought it'd be fun to throw in a joke about Sizemore being Hanks' mother.WHY?!? He had everyone on the edge of their seat (literally, I remember looking around the theatre and every jaw was dropped) and he decides to lighten the tone by dropping in a fricking JOKE?!?From here the film goes from bad to worse to utter garbage, as we are dragged through a war-is-hell-by-numbers affair. Never one to miss an opportunity to manipulate, Spielberg makes us endure some pretty feeble philosophising, Ted Danson trying to be serious (yes, Ted Danson), a token ""death of the youngest soldier"" tragedy and some of the most sentimentally contrived dialogue I have ever suffered, which never really stood a chance coming from the worst group of two-dimensional characters ever assembled for a movie.Then there's the premise; a group of men is sent across the country to find one guy because good ol' compassionate Uncle Sam thinks the titular soldier's poor Ma has suffered enough in losing her other three sons. Is this a joke?!?""But it's a true story"" I hear you cry. Wrongo! It may have been inspired by a true story, but that doesn't mean that anything beyond the name James Ryan actually existed. The words ""inspired by a true story"" don't mean a thing these days and, let us not forget, this is Spielberg.Let us not forget indeed, as Stevie does inject some excitement and tension into the action set pieces, even if they are overlong, predictable, and dangerously close to many a scene from many a war movie that came before it. The final sequence falls on its arse before it even begins due to the hilarious, A-Team style montage that precedes it, in which we see our apple-pie heroes create a stronghold from various items they find lying around a conveniently deserted village, before the six or so of them defeat an entire platoon of those nasty Germans.Perhaps the worst crime this film committed was being released against Terrence Mallick's 'The Thin Red Line', and subsequently taking the two Oscars which by right belonged to the latter (Best Director and Best Cinematography).'Ryan's Privates' pales in comparison not just to Mallick's film (as well as to Spielberg's other ""classic"" manipulative-therapy session, 'ET') but to almost every war movie I have seen ('Cross of Iron', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon', 'All Quite on the Wetsern Front'), even those which do not profess to be the greatest war epic of all time or even take themselves seriously ('Mash', 'Kelly's Heroes', 'Where Eagles Dare', 'The Eagle Has Landed'). One great battle scene does not a great war movie make, but try telling the Academy that.Bottom line? Don't expect more than a sub-par Spielberg offering and you won't be disappointed. Expect a profoundly moving war classic, and you'll be choking on your rage like I was when I left the cinema nine years ago.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Never so many owed so much to so few !,"The greatest battle in the twentieth century took place at the shores of Normandy, and it was fought by courageous soldiers who spilled their guts and payed the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.Out there in that beach, Dog Green Sector, Omaha beach, hundreds if not thousands of courageous American soldiers took and kept a vital position for an invasion to liberate the old continent. Their warrior spirit allowed them to gain a bitter victory.Too many young Americans died in that battle for making possible to send other people free. This source of American pride moves me in so many ways. We love the American heroism and we share our admiration for the greatest warriors: the American soldiers.This movie, starring a great American actor, Tom Hanks, in the role of Captain Miller, 2nd Ranger, shows the American attitude and the struggle they went through to achieve one of the greatest American victories in world history. It is not easy to understand the huge victory it was for America and world freedom to win the most important war in history. I will always love America for that.Other fantastic American actors like Vin Diesel and Giovani Ribisi play an awesome performance as heroic kind-hearted soldiers in the face of evil, showing all the heroism we can expect from an Army Ranger.All in all this movie is a must-see and it is worth to buy the DVD. The fantastic soundtrack and the emotional flag-waving at the end of the movie make your eyes to water-up. You will never forget this excellent Hollywood production and the wonderful story told will get you speechless for a while.",,Anonymous,Drama
Overrated and uneven,"Plenty of war drama and blockbuster action to start the movie, then a long boring few hours to end it. Very unrealistic overall. Hardly a great war movie. If we are to view the title of the movie as the plot of the movie, then we have been fooled greatly.If it is really saving Private Ryan, then why no scenes of Private Ryan until the movie is almost over? Well, if there had been, then they couldn't have played that little prank on the viewers of the first Private Ryan saved being the wrong one (Matt Damon).If you are going to watch this movie, have plenty of coffee, because after the first half you will fall asleep quick.

some upsetting battle sequences for a plain story,"War movies have often been one of Steven Spielberg' specialities. This one achieved a huge public and critic success. What drew the attention in this war movie are fight sequences. They're extremely violent and bloody. We have been rarely so far in the reality of fights. It's difficult to forget the first half an hour of the movie during the Normandy landings. Spielberg's sober and showy directing increases the phenomenon.However, you must admit it, the movie is based on a trite, plain even conventional story. You could use this last word to describe the famous Ryan soldier. Indeed, he's told that he can go home because all his brothers have been killed. Instead, he wants to keep on fighting.Apart from this and in spite of a few weaknesses, ""saving private Ryan"" is a thrilling war movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Self-medication, Mr. Spielberg?","This movie serves two purposes: a) glorify the American soldier from World War II and the American nation in general and b) help Mr. Spielberg overcome his own neurosis about being Jewish, a task he started with ""Schindler's List."" That probably makes him the envy of anyone who ever saw a psychologist: to get paid for spreading out your psyche instead of having to pay for it.The first 20 minutes of this movie are amazing, indeed. Very well captured is the sheer horror of landing on a fortified beach; the disorientation, the killing etc. But after that, this movie drops on the level of ""Armageddon"": a mother has a number of sons, all of them died during the war, except one and the US military surely puts the life of half a dozen soldiers into peril to save that last one. Of course, that is completely logical.The German soldiers, in the contrary, don't seem to have mothers or anyone who cares about them, they are ugly, lean-mean-killing machines, shouting incomprehensible things and should be killed wherever possible. They are also not just as scared as any other simple soldier on a battle field, they don't have any feelings at all.So, what could have been a great movie, with all the money spent for and stars on it, playing in the same league as ""All quiet on the Western Front"" gets to be completely pathetic, unrealistic, super-patriotic and one-sided. Steven Spielberg once said that he often didn't feel he was a ""real"" American and was left-out because of him being Jewish and that the past of his family haunts him. It is ok to feel that way and I wish him he will finally get rid of both feelings. But on the other hand he also was left out of getting an ""Oscar"" until ""Schindler's List."" That was a well done movie, but on the long run it seems it didn't do Spielberg too good. Somewhere he must have come to the conclusion that doing movies about WWII helps him overcome his problems and making them patriotic will help him getting an Oscar.If you are interested in a realistic look on war, watch ""All quiet on the Western Front"" or ""Das Boot.""",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
If you hate this movie then you should understand something...,"Many reviews I have heard about this movie that are negative all say something along the lines that it shows the Americans as heroes, shows the Germans as evil killing monsters, and that it basically is just a big American Propaganda film. Lets be serious here, WW2 has been over for quite a while, we know who won the war, we know who the bad guys were...The Waffen SS and Hitler. So there is no need to have a WW2 propaganda film almost 60 years after the war had ended. The Wermacht soldiers they do battle with in this film are not shown as monsters, they are basically not given any character, just as the enemy that needs to be killed in order to win the battle. Which is exactly what the Germans were to the Allies in WW2. Not to mention the soldier that confronts Upham on the stairwell, if the Germans were portrayed as mindless killers then that Soldier would not have had a second's hesitation to kill Upham. This film shows the war through the eyes of a small group of US soldiers. The Germans are referred to as krauts, and just as the enemy. This is deliberate during wars to show the enemy as objects instead of human beings so it makes it easier for them to kill the enemy.It shows the Americans as heroes...not for winning the war, but for the battles they fight in during the course of the film. Yes it shows the US soldiers taking Omaha Beach in 30 minutes when it obviously took a lot more than that. But this movie is FICTIONAL it is only INSPIRED by real events, nor does it say anywhere in the film ""this movie is based on a true story."" It glorifies the deaths of the main characters, because like i said before it is shown through the eyes of this group of soldiers. Therefore they'd be up close and have their friends dying in their arms, and it would be emotional. Not that it was any different for the German soldiers, but the US soldiers wouldn't know because the Germans were the enemy to them. If they were to make this film from the German's point of view, then any American who hates it, and loves this film is an ignorant hypocrite. So before you chastise Spielberg and the film itself. Just think about that.",,Anonymous,Drama
A movie that captures the character of a generation,"Read dedjim's comments on this movie. His are the best by far. I'm sad to see that this sight is mainly a place where people come to express their thinly veiled political diatribes in the guise of a movie review.This was a great movie about sacrifice, courage, loss, violence, revenge, folly, and most of all the strength of character it took (and takes) to defeat evil. The young people of that time defeated fascism (and later communism). Their children and grandchildren would not have their character forged in a worldwide depression dovetailed with a worldwide war. This reality explains much about the differences between the generations. Theirs was one of stoicism. The ones that followed were less mature, and generally lacking in accurate historical perspective - I say this as a retort to those who post on here mainly invoking their political bents.This movie is a more accurate ""experience"" of WW2 than most movies made on the subject. My next door neighbor for 15 years was one of the most gentle and humor-filled men I have ever known. He never once mentioned to me that he was a decorated WW2 bomber pilot. But he was. He came from a humble background; was wounded in the war; lost many friends in the war; and met his future wife (Army nurse) during the war. Then he returned from the war and instead of letting his experiences ruin him and the country, he and his compatriots helped rebuild a nation and a world.

Excellent combat scenes - unrealistic dialogue,"I wish I could view this movie like the average moviegoer. In that case, I would probably have given it higher marks. However, I was in the Army and know that dialogue such as is in this film would be highly unlikely, no, impossible, to have been said in real life.The hierarchy in the service is very clear: privates do not contradict, interrupt, defy, or in any way address their superiors as is depicted in this film. I found a number of scenes to be pure Spielberg fantasy. The scene in which Hanks doesn't provide the full name of the 'Ryan' he is searching for, which results in Hanks delivering the wrong information to the wrong 'Ryan', is hard to swallow. The scene with Matt Damon protesting when told he is being taken off the front lines is also hard to believe.The scene where Oppem (or whatever his name was) protests against shooting the POW is absurd. No way that would have ever happened. Some of the other unlikely aspects of the film: Tom Sizemore throws his .45 caliber pistol at the German; four soldiers pull the pins on their grenades and drop them in the tank turret, yet none of them detonate. The scene at the end when Tom Hanks starts firing at the tank with his .45. In real life, he would have been dead by then after being shot in the back with what amounts to a high powered rifle.The scenes after the Germans bring their 20 mm. cannon into action also didn't get very far past the GI's first encounter with the fearsome weapon. After it annihilates about six or seven GIs from one short volley, one wonders why the Germans didn't make quick work of the rest of the GIs after that.The dialogue was also a bit too pristine for my tastes. In reality, GIs curse up a storm. These guys were a wee bit too polite and wholesome. Platoon gave a much more accurate account of how GIs actually behave.These criticisms aside, the action scenes are well staged and evoke a healthy pulse pounding for the viewer.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
B-movie about D-day.,"The more I think about this film and read differing reviews about it the more I feel it wasn't meant for me. I'm a Finn, not American. I don't know if Spielberg meant this film as a last hoorah for the G.I.:s, but to me that is what he made. All right the film does have something to tell for everyone: in the insane theatre of war one should try to do the right thing, have courage to do it, that your actions have consequences, war as a whole creates nothing but bad feelings and probably something else too but nothing that has not been told earlier.And I suppose that isn't so bad, I mean there have certainly been worse films. But what does bother me is that Spielberg set out to do a film about what war is really like and to me, he failed. Yes I have seen the opening scene and to me it was more about exploitation and action film then about anything else and not even very memorable action. Even if one would skip all the omissions and strange things about the film (in the landing scene no naval artillery support, no air force support and the illogical German tactics in the final battlescenes) to me the main plot is a strange curiosity that only serves to illustrate that the average soldier wasn't that interesting or important. Apparently with some links to reality the main plot remains distant and odd to me.With Oscar, block-buster, critically acclaimed material as ww2 with all the gore how could Spielberg go wrong? First of all the acting. Well I could not stop wishing there would have been some lesser known actors used, maybe even amateurs. A lot has been made out of the cinematography and yes, it is good. Although to me it is not so effective when there is apparently too much money to make a film and then the camera work tries to make it look more realistic. As ww2 films go this film is a far cry from ""Come and See"". Yes I do admit that flag waving is a common problem among ww2 movies, I just wished that Spielberg could have avoided it.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Along With ""Schindler's List"", Spielberg's Best","Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the those films that is a pure cinematic masterpiece.  It's gritty, realistic, and well-made in every possible department.  The film captured five Oscars and probably should have won the Best Picture Oscar for 1998.  Some things about the film that really stick out are the cinematography (where approximately 60% of the color was faded from each frame), the editing, and of course Spielberg's direction. I'm not sure any other director working today could have done as well as Spielberg did on this picture.  Tom Hanks is also excellent.  He is one of those rare actors who can dominate a film without dominating it (in other words he's always there, but he makes the supporting actors better).  In many ways this may have been his best acting job ever.  All in all ""Saving Private Ryan"" is easily one of the top 10 or 15 films of the 1990s.

It throws you into the biggest armed conflict of our time while deftly and carefully drawing you into a very intimate story that puts many aspects of the war into perspective.Reviewing a war film is difficult for someone who has never been in one. I don't think any serious critic would pretend to know what it's like to be in such a horrifying event. I think the best you can do is speculate, and even then, you risk treading on some serious ground by giving such films a review.That being said, the film looks, feels, sounds, and moves perfectly from start to finish. Technically, it's a masterpiece. The lesser-known stars give as good of a performance as the big-name actors, which is a sign of terrific directing. The personal story-line weaves effortlessly within the big drama of the war, and the whole thing is written beautifully.As I'm writing this, I can think of no flaws. Some people give Spielberg a hard time for being overly sentimental, but I just don't see it in SPR. The emotions all seem appropriate for the environment. The action is riveting and often brutal. Characters fall off the radar quickly. The war is overwhelming. It all makes sense in context.The best films are like statues; solid, powerful, and eternal. This one will stand for a long time. Even if some of Spielberg's films get taken down a notch for sentimentality and overblown spectacle-making, this one won't, and never will.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Brings you to tears, kinda sad too","To be honest, it's Tom Hanks that attracted me in the first place to check it out, but the story was absolutely powerful, touches deep inside. Amid all the killings in the backdrop of war (way too much) and lives lost in the process of saving Ryan...something about humanity shines through and elevate your inner being, but the loss of lives still make you a bit sad in the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Story is great,"My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable ""I can't watch this"" reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Tough, real, touching, and superb","Saving Private Ryan is the best Second World War movie ever made.The good. Almost everything could be listed here as exceptional, but I'll just mention what really makes this a master piece. First and foremost, the fighting and how it's depicted. You feel the same stress, terror, and confusion as the soldiers. There are some heroics, but it's normal man heroics. Men die by the score, there's no favorites. It's dirty, it's loud, it's dangerous, it's inhumane. Beyond that, you've got an incredibly compelling story, amazing photography, a rich scenario, very attaching and real characters, as well as interesting thoughtful dialogs.The actors. There are so many excellent ones, and a number that were on the cusp of their stardom. Tom Hanks is of course in one of his best incarnation ever. Tom Sizemore is the perfect solid loyal sergent. Paul Giamatti has a small role, but without contest one of his best by playing his normal edgy style in a war context with a thin veneer of authority and calm. Edward Burns is just right as the loud mouth New Yorker. And you cheer Barry Pepper as the God blessed sniper. Now for a few surprises. Giovanni Ribisi, playing a bit far from his usual role, is excellent as the overwhelmed caring medic. Dennis Farina, which I normally do not like, is a stoic senior officer with an calm aura. You can also see a young Nathan Fillion in a quick cameo. Here, one might argue whether Matt Damon was given a large role or not, but he did carry it out well, if a bit subpar for him. However, the truly big surprise is the appearance of Vin Diesel playing something completely out of his usual affectations with credible results.The bad. It's a near perfect film, but there's one thing that irked me. The family of the veteran was either badly chosen of badly directed. When he starts to cry they all act as if it was a big surprise. Really? What did you think he was going to do?The ugly. Nothing.The result. Be ready for some tough bloody scenes, and you'll love this realistic representation of war.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the Most Overrated Films Ever,"Count me among the group of dissenters that thinks ""Saving Private Ryan"" is 20 minutes of technically expert film-making capped by 140 minutes of monotonous war film punctuated by treacly and typical Spielbergian emotional histrionics.Spielberg's attempts at meticulously recreating the Omaha Beach invasion that take up the first half hour or so of this film are stunning. But the film grinds to a halt after that with a lame story and shallow characters that go nowhere. Spielberg wants us all to feel guilty (doesn't he always) about what soldiers in WWII went through, but his way to do that is to throw brutal violence in our faces every few minutes. The thing is, it's not the violence that makes other and better war films bring home the horrors of war to its audience; it's the depiction of what war does to a man's psyche. It's another film from 1998 set during WWII combat, Terence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line,"" that stands as the year's masterpiece about war. But audiences ignored that film because Malick wasn't willing to hold their hands and tell them how they should feel, something Spielberg could teach a class in.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Most Overrated Film Of All Time?,"It may not be the MOST overrated, but it's certainly up there along with Scream and Fargo and There's Something About Mary.Oh what a battle scene - the fantastic motion sickness inducing cinematography, the masterfully overhyper editing, the gore, oh the wonderful gore.  And so forth.The Omaha beach landing was quite intense.  It was brutal and affecting. But people just can't seem to get it into their heads that one extended battle scene does not a great film make.After *that*, we get yet another version of a tired, clichéd mission movie, filled with your usual stereotypes: reminiscing about the good ol' days before this all ever happened, doing whatever it takes just to get home, blah, blah, blah. Also painfully stereotypical are the characters: we have the saddened captain who misses his normal job and life, we've got the hardnut sergeant, the Italian guy, the Jewish guy, the New Yorker, and so forth.  And all the Germans are skinheaded bastards - and by the way, where the hell were the other allied troops?  Oh, I forgot, it was the Americans that won the war (flag shots at the beginning and end are just painfully sad).The middle of the MOVIE is incredibly boring.  Pointless, predictable set-pieces are tiresome.  The scenes in which the rattled soldiers tell little stories of life at home (the medic talking about his mother, Ryan talking about his brothers, etc.) are awful attempts at evoking sympathy and sentimentality.Then there's the final battle.  Outnumbered, the men revert to primitive tactics (a bit like Predator).  Quite unbelievably, this lengthy fight is incredibly boring, and the one at the end of Young Guns is far better.5 Oscars?  Obviously due to the beach landing bit, they are mostly undeserved.  Best Director - should have been Peter Weir, or Terence Malick. Best Cinematography - John Toll for The Thin Red Line, without any doubt in the world.  Editing - Out Of Sight deserved this even more than The Thin Red Line.  I suppose the two sound awards are justified.For people to call this the Greatest War Film Of All Time is just wrong. The best is Apocalypse Now.  This is not the best World War Two film either - Das Boot is.  This can't even be described as the best D-Day/Normandy beach landings movie either - The Longest Day kicks its a**.   To go even further - this is not even Spielberg's best war film.  Schindler's List is superior.To summarise - great beginning, but the rest sucked.  If you haven't seen it, don't bother.  Or, if you insist, watch the beginning, then leave/press stop.  You'll be doing yourself a big favour.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Tough watch, but great film",Tom Hanks - what can I say. You can't go wrong with this actor. The film is a touch watch. Particularly at the beginning. Not for the faint hearted.

Spielberg's breathtaking and brutally realistic war epic!,"Throughout the history of cinema there have been numerous all time great war films, but try as they might, there is still no war film quite like Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.The film treats the subject of war with the respect, dignity, and realism that it deserves while also telling a throughly riveting story. Everything that you have heard about the World War 2 battle scenes in this film is true. Each one is stunning, harrowing to behold, and remarkably well shot. The brutal realism and horror of these scenes cannot be understated. These are the kinds of battles that will chill you to the bone, leave you speechless, and make you pray that you NEVER find yourself on the battlefield. This is mainly due to the incredibly immersive sound design and cinematography of the film which always makes you feel as if you are right there with the soldiers as they are being dismembered, burned alive, and shamelessly slaughtered. The battle sequences are infamous for featuring no music, only the constant, monstrous sounds of shell explosions, machine gunfire, and blood curdling screams. Spielberg also frequently made expert use of first person shaky cam shots during the battles in order to put the audience right in the middle of the chaos and destruction.However, despite all the brutality, it would mean nothing without an effective story and likeable characters. But, the film shines brightly in this department too. Most of the soldiers that the film focuses on are three dimensional and feel like real people. Moreover they are all given solid acting performances by their respective actors. In particular, Tom Hanks and Matt Damon's performances as Captain Miller and the titular Private Ryan are obvious standouts. Hanks is well known for delivering all time great performances in practically every film that he stars in and this film is no exception. Hanks comes across as strong willed, likeable, and experienced in the role. The young Damon also delivers a realistic and down to earth performance as Ryan. Both characters are well written and flawed, with Miller in particular experiencing substantial growth throughout the movie through a great character arc.The film's screenplay and plot are some of the best in the history of the war film genre. The physical and moral struggles that soliders must endure during war are conveyed exceptionally well in this film. Characters often make morally ambiguous decisions that blur the lines between right and wrong. In fact, it is debatable whether the mere premise of the story is right or wrong. The film also explores the effect that war has on each individual solider, as well as whether it is acceptable to be a good sumaritan on the battlefield . These are very mature and thought provoking themes that go far deeper than most war movies (especially the ones made before this film) dare to go.Overall, Saving Private Ryan has earned it's status as one of, if not the greatest war film of all time, and one of the very best films of Steven Spielberg's all time great filmography.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Earn this...,"In reading through the comments made on this page, I realize that people had several interpretations and opinions of what this movie was supposed to be (as people often do).  However, here's how I feel the movie was intended, and why I say that this is by far the greatest war movie, and one of the greatest movies of any genre. The prevailing comments among nay-sayers is that the characters were too stereo-typical, and that a plot of one man being important enough to risk the lives of 8 was unbelievable. That's exactly what Spielberg wanted. First, the characters.  They were _intended_ to be stereotypical.  How could you represent every man that ever fought in this, and other, wars without being stereotypical?  Unless, of course you wanted to have a cast of several million people.  The point was to show the trevails that every man went through in the war, NOT to give a unique face to each. And it seems he did this with his usual mastery.Second, the plot.  The mistake that most are making is that they're thinking of Private Ryan as one man.  He wasn't.  He was everyone.  Every person that was sitting in that theater.  Every person that has ever been a part of this country.   When he tells Ryan to ""Earn this"", he is talking to YOU. He is saying that we're not here today by accident.  It took normal men (a school-teacher, for instance) to make sure that we could someday go on IMDB after seeing a movie and spout our opinions. He is telling you not to waste the precious life you've been given. So, yes, this is perhaps the greatest movie of all time, shaky camera or not.  And they fought so that I could sit here on my soapbox and give my opinion. Thank God.",,Anonymous,Drama
The Real Life Story behind Saving Private Ryan,"The 1998 movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the all-time great war movies. While much of the movie is a fictional account, the premise behind Capt. Miller's mission is based on a true story. That is the story of the Niland brothers - Edward, Preston, Robert, and Frederick - from Tonawanda, New York.The two middle brothers, Preston and Robert, had enlisted prior to the beginning of the War. After America entered the war the oldest, Edward, and youngest, Frederick, known as Fritz to his friends, joined up in November 1942. Because of the tragedy of the Sullivan brothers aboard the USS Juneau earlier that year, the brothers were split up and sent to different units around the Army. Edward became an enlisted pilot, with the rank of Technical Sergeant, of a B-25 Mitchell bomber flying in the Burma-India-China theatre. Preston was commissioned into the infantry and assigned to Company C, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. Robert and Fritz both became paratroopers. Robert served with Company D, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. Fritz joined Company H, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. U.S. Army paratroopers are dropped near Grave, Netherlands while livestock graze near gliders that landed earlier. This was the beginning of Operation Market Garden during World War II, which resulted in heavy Allied losses. As fate would have it, three of the brothers found themselves preparing for the invasion of mainland Europe.However, before the brothers could start their ""Great Crusade"" to liberate Europe, Edward was shot down somewhere over Burma. He was listed as Missing in Action, but this usually carried a presumption of death at the time, especially if he had fallen into the hands of the Japanese. Then, in the early morning hours of June 6, 1944, Robert and Fritz joined over 23,000 Allied paratroopers in cracking Fortress Europe. Although Fritz's unit, 3rd Battalion, 501st PIR, was supposed to be the division reserve, the misdrops meant they were thrust into action in ad hoc groups. These forces were able to secure vital causeways, bridges, and locks allowing the 4th Infantry Division, and Niland brother Preston, to exit Utah beach later that day. U.S. Soldiers of the 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, move out over the seawall on Utah Beach after coming ashore. Other troops are resting behind the concrete wall. Elsewhere, Robert Niland had landed outside of Ste. Mere-Eglise with the rest of the 505th as part of Mission Boston. After the 3rd Battalion was able to capture the town early in the morning, the 2ndBattalion linked up with it to establish a defensive perimeter. When a strong German counter-attack came from the south, Robert Niland and the rest of D Company's 3rd platoon were left to guard the northern approaches to the town in a small village called Neuville. When two companies of Germans came at their position, they fought tenaciously to hold them off to buy time for their comrades to the south. When the position became untenable, Robert Niland, along with two other paratroopers, volunteered to stay behind and cover the platoon's retreat toward Ste. Mere-Eglise.While manning a machine gun in the face of the German onslaught, Robert Niland was killed in action. That very same morning, Lt. Preston Niland led his men onto the shores of Utah beach as part of the seaborne invasion of Normandy. Though casualties were relatively light for the men of the 4th Infantry Division on Utah beach, the battles beyond would be much tougher. Despite having made if off the beaches, the men of the 4th Infantry Division still had numerous gun batteries of Hitler's Atlantic Wall to clear. The task of capturing the Crisbecq battery, which had already sunk the destroyer USS Corry, fell to Lt. Niland and his men. On June 7, Niland led his men against the German position. During the heavy fighting Niland fell mortally wounded. The rest of his unit was repulsed. The battery would not fall until several days later to units of the 9th Infantry Division. The Niland brothers' parents received all three notifications in a very short amount of time. Their only condolence was a letter from Fritz informing them that ""Dad's Spanish-American War stories are going to have to take a backseat when I get home. ""Fritz was unaware of the fate of his brothers. When the War Department received word of the tragedy orders were dispatched to return Fritz Niland to the United States. That task fell to the regimental Chaplin, Father Francis Sampson. Sampson located Fritz, who had been searching for his brother in the 82nd and began to paperwork to send him home. Returning to the United States in 1944, Fritz served for the remainder of the war as an MP in New York.This article was written by James Elphick and originally appeared on WeAreTheMighty.com",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"For war-movie aficionados, a personal epic...","Director Steven Spielberg's usual homey touch (which infiltrated even ""Schlinder's List"" in its final act) is thankfully in slight evidence here, as WWII soldiers attempt to locate one particular man whose siblings have all been killed in combat. The set-up for the plot is a bit formulaic (and layered with Spielberg's need for romanticism), but the very fine performances and exhaustingly exact scenes of violence remain haunting and memorable. Vivid cinematography and frenetic editing won Oscars, as did Spielberg (who deserved it). I was rather surprised by how powerful this movie is, given the feel-good reputations by many of the principals involved. I'm not a lover of this particular movie genre, but the film pulls no punches in detailing many unrelenting scenes of battle. *** from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A MOVIE IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE REACTION IT PROVOKES!,"Numbing shock...on a cellular level...motivated me to return to the theater a week later, to experience it again. I was not in the least disappointed. Indulged myself by acquiring the DVD soon after its release and reliving the experience on numerous occasions!In RYAN, Spielberg succeeds in getting inside the viewer's head by immersing us in his ingeniously structured cascading time-lapse glacier of chaos, resulting in a 2½ hour free-fall rush into overwhelming impotence! RYAN seers the hell of war into every pore of your psyche, like no other war movie before or since. Watching it is a delightful exercise in masochistic pleasure.Certainly, anything but war friendly, Spielberg's 1998 classic, the highest rated war themed film in the history of cinema (#24-IMDb Top 250 today), only makes oblique reference to the diabolical nature of the Nazi juggernaut. RYAN tenaciously and consistently drives home the only ""shades of gray"" nature of the nuts and bolts, day-to-day, moment to moment decision options available in the heat of battle! I offer, as an example of this, various moments of onscreen interaction with German prisoner of war, nicknamed ""Steamboat Willie""...Just watch, eventually you will understand!Also, I think a special note of recognition is due to Denise Chamian...If the name doesn't ring a bell, don't feel bad...she did not register with me either! Her name appears for The CASTING Credit of RYAN. Superb job, Ms. Chamian! (Minority Report/Big Fish) She has been nominated on multiple occasions by the Casting Society of America...but RYAN seems to be her only win! (An extremely well deserved one, in my opinion)The Ensemble cast also received a Screen Actors Guild Nomination in that category. After having seen RYAN at least 10 times, I stand firmly by this accolade: One of the BEST Ensemble performances ever!To anyone out there who hasn't seen RYAN, maybe because of its War or Action genre label...This is one hell of a humanistic Greek tragedy that you simply must see! To those of you who have seen it once or twice, but who haven't in years....

About the history,"I have to agree, this is really good historical fiction, one note however... there were guys on the beach that had what looked like a Yen-yang on their shoulder and on the back of the helmet, which would be the 29th Infantry Division (a National Guard Unit), instead of either a diamond with a #2 (2nd Rangers, which we saw) or a #5 (which we didn't see).  As far as I can find, only the 2nd and 5th Rangers were in the first wave of the assault, led by then LTC James Earl Rudder, and thus there should have been no 29th Inf, at least not in the first wave.  A couple of really good books on the subject is ""Rudder's Rangers : The True Story of the 2nd Ranger Battalion D-Day Combat Action"" and ""The Liberation of Pointe Du Hoc : The 2nd Rangers at Normandy, June 6-8, 1944""  One thing that would probably suprise most people is that LTC Rudder came onshore with his men, and that his was one of the first transports to hit the beach, and that he lived through it.  Of course, he was a Texas Aggie, that alone could be why his forces were able to succeed.  Read the books, you'll never watch SPR the same way again.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great Film,"This was one of the first war movies that i've seen, and it has to be one of the best. Steven Spielberg has directed what has to be a masterpiece. The movie is accurate,although there are petty details that could have made this film better than it already is. From the beginning of the film, Spielberg gives us a sense of the dramatic landings on Omaha beach, a view of the whole allied advance on Normandy, once the Axis trenches and bunkers have been taken. The way Spielberg captivates each character within one another, and yet be different from one another is superb. I think Steve Spielberg has captivated the idea of brotherhood and comradeship, which in turn has what i think led him to the making of the HBO mini-series, Band of Brothers. The cinematography has to be credited, and the background music is fitting for such a film, thats why i gave it 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The best depiction of war?,"Watching this for the first time was an experience like no other. There have been countless war films that have followed this film yet none of them were able to make me feel the way Saving Private Ryan did.Saving Private Ryan takes us on a journey with eight US soldiers, led by Captain Miller, as they go behind enemy lines to find and bring home a solider whose brothers have been killed in action.Steven Spielberg has made some of my favourite films of all time but I consider Saving Private Ryan to be one of his best directorial efforts. The opening 30 minutes alone is among my favourites. Every single aspect of the Omaha Beach sequence is sheer brilliance. I'm not someone that's fond of handheld cam but Spielberg used in a way that transported me into this battle like no other film. I truly felt like I was there in the moment, trying to fight off the Germans whilst fearing for my life as my comrades died beside me. I cannot imagine how incredible and emotional this sequence must have been in a cinema. Spielberg really didn't hold back on the violence either. The blood and gore add to the brutality and harsh nature of war. It's absolutely crazy to think of the lengths soldiers would go to and sacrifices they would make for their country and the film's graphic nature depicts their bravery and struggle perfectly.The film is nearly 3 hours long but Spielberg keeps it engaging and riveting through its runtime. There is not a single dull moment at any point. Even when there isn't any action taking place, we get so much character development that takes us deep into the minds of their soldiers. Scenes of them sitting down and bonding with one another brings us closer to these people allowing the emotional impact to be even stronger. The visuals are incredible in every way. From the grey and dark green colour palette to the destroyed landscapes, each and every part of the production design and technicals is beautifully done.What also adds to the emotional core of the film are the wonderful performances by the cast. Knowing how great of an actor Tom Hanks is, he always manages to surprise me. His portrayal of Cpt. John Miller is amongst his best work. Matt Damon and Vin Diesel are also terrific in their roles. Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Edward Burns, Adam Goldberg, Jeremy Davies and Giovanni Ribisi are all spectacular in their roles as soldiers and put forth very natural performances.Saving Private Ryan may possibly be the best war film ever made. It's gruesome and honest depiction of war pays a great tribute to all the soldiers that fought in the war. Steven Spielberg has outdone himself here as well as the actors and the entire crew.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
a true masterpiece,"Saving Private Ryan will probably be remembered as a true classic, the best war movie ever made that presented World War II as good as possible... For those who haven't seen the movie - Run, Run and don't look back, go rent it, and enjoy every minute of it.The movie begins with the well known American invasion to Europe in operation Overlord at the problematic Omaha Beach. Never in filming industry had there been a better war scene, so true, so real, making you actually feel like you are a soldier taking part in the invasion... Spielberg didn't censor what the war was probably really like by showing less blood, less dead and less wounded. In fact, this scene, showing zero regards to Human life isn't just to make the viewers feel excited, its true purpose will be understood only later, after watching the film...Following the invasion, Cpt Miller (Tom Hanks) gets another mission - ""straight from the top"" - Rescuing a private parachuted deep in enemy territory after 3 of his brothers lost their lives in the war. Eight men, rescuing one.After the bloodsheded scene in Omaha, this mission looks rather stupid, one life? is it really worth endangering the lives of eight? Omaha beach showed how hundreds die like little defenseless mosquitoes... How is one life that important? Without a doubt, Spielberg didn't randomly choose a mission to base a movie about. This movie isn't just an action film... It has an hidden message, It shows that on the side of war, with so much dead, zero regards for human life we are all still human- those who die at war aren't just soldiers, they're men, with lives, desires, needs - they have names, brothers, sisters - and each and every one of them counts... Omaha is war, it presented it quiet good but the rest of the movie - well, thats humanity... Suddenly, one life does count, and endangering the lives of eight looks rather right.Don't get me wrong, the movie is all action. true hardcore action... The rest of the movie, following the invasion, escorts the small squad led by Cpt. Miller as they search for one soldier, Private James Ryan, in occupied France... Endless battle-scenes, action, suspense - actual war...I will stop here without spoiling any part of the film - This movie cant be described in words...

I have read numerous reputable books and watched award winning documentaries about WW2 and viewed a long list of films featuring various parts of the war but nothing I had heard about this film prepared me for the opening sequence. I doubt there is anyone on this planet who would not be affected in one way or another by it. You can get a dictionary out and list the adjectives but those 22 minutes are infinitely more descriptive than centuries of books, unrealistic films and fancy speeches. The whole film is close on three hours and is and hopefully always will be an education for anybody watching. For me this film should be regarded like a monument to all the people who have gone to war irrespective of when or where it took place or why it started in the first place. I suspect that the real thing was worse than what is shown in the film but what is shown is graphic enough. We have been killing each other for centuries but this like a select few other films lays it all out realistically. I personally thank the director and the entire cast and crew for the result of all their hard work. For anybody out there who has not seen this film please watch it and if possible stop reading this stuff I have written and lob the DVD into the machine and make your own mind up.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
My Favorite Movie of Alltime,"I first watched this movie when I was a young'un. It had an impact on me, more than I could have imagined. At that time (I was still a kid then) I wanted to join the Army, because I assumed that I could simply pull out a machine-gun and blast everyone to oblivion. This movie made me see the light. Now that I'm older, and can understand films better, I can fully appreciate the beauty of this film. It's gritty without being gruesome, it's brutally honest without overwhelming you, it's funny while it focuses on the drama; it's just plain brilliant. It deserved every Oscar it got, and more in my opinion. The cinematography alone is to die for.All in all, 11/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Truly an epic, with an epic influence.","Breathtaking. Spectacular. Incredible. Whatever words used to describe this film do no justice to what Spielberg so masterfully created. This movie is the only movie to have left me in awe, in shock, in sadness. On all levels this film was perfect. I do not know how historically accurate it may have been, but I know one thing. This is one of the most memorable films ever made, and it should be recognized as the best war movie to date. I am a proud Canadian citizen, but this film gave me a greater respect for what the Americans were trying to do in Europe. I used to protest the fact that they joined the war late, however this film has shown me that they suffered as great a loss as all the countries involved in that war.The film truly was an epic, an epic that will leave me to think for some time.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The best war movie ever!,"This movie is the greatest war movie ever! Tom Hanks was a perfect captain and Matt Damon was such a great Private Ryan. The beach scene was such a great scene, although it was pretty intense the way that Steven Speilburg directed that scene was truly fantastic. Another scene that was truly touching was when they had to tell the mother that her three sons were dead and they didn't know where her forth son was. It made me feel like crying and I'm sure that all the other fans out there felt the same way.The ending is very dramatic, but Steven didn't go overboard. When the old James Ryan almost starts to cry I felt the same way. When Tom Hanks died that was the ultimate surprise or scene in the movie. It was awesomely brilliant, but very sad. That's my basic overview and opinion on ""Saving Private Ryan."" -Ashley",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Timeless Piece of Filmmaking,"I just recently had a chance to re-watch this film in a cinemaplex. Not exactly Imax, but it was a larger screen than my home TV, and theatre audio was superb. I saw this film when it originally came out in theaters in 1998. The opening sequence gained notoriety for it's unflinching visceral photography and shockingly graphic violence. I have watched this film a few times since then, but seeing it on a larger screen, I had an appreciation for the realism that Spielberg insisted on. If it was virtually any other filmmaker, the expense of realistic production with extra attention to detail would not have happened. Instead we would have been presented something not as noteworthy.These efforts were the reason it won several Academy Awards. There is so much depth to the story. The film zips along with small set pieces that provide some kind of insight to the enigma of war. Not only are there some classic performances, there are classic faces. Bryan Cranston, Vin Diesel, Matt Damon, Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Tom Sizemore, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Dennis Farina, Barry Pepper. Very recognizable faces.Tom Hanks, now less of an A list star compared to the 90s, gives a very natural performance. He shouts commands as a confident captain taking part in the most incredible feat attempted by our country. We get to witness these events, partially through the gun-shy eyes of Corp. Upham, played by a meek looking Jeremy Davis. He reacts as most of the audience would to the cacophonous noise and chaos. He flinches as much as anyone would with bombs going off right next to you. He also represents the humane approach to the war, which of course goes against reason at times.There are accolades to go around, including a detailed script. Capt. Miller's unknown career back in the states. Searching through a pile of dogtags. A glider landing that went FUBAR. A genuinely funny anecdote about the Ryan brothers before the war. Coherent explanation of strategies and improvised weapons. When confronted with a dilemma, the script smartly explores it to find a piece of wisdom that the audience can learn from. So we get a history lesson about the first few days of the D-Day invasion, while being entertained with believable and memorable characters.The cinematography can be considered a landmark in visceral storytelling. The use of high shutter speeds removes the normal blur when there is an explosion. In this case, the explosion particles are vividly in focus, and feel all the more real and lethal. I lost track when watching the more technical aspects of the film of how many shots were done in a single take. In the final battle, there is a shot following Upham from cowering from an explosion, tracking him to another building on another block, with a tank and soldiers approaching, returning back to the previous street, and ending with a conversation with Sgt Horvath (Sizemore). There are many more long shots like this throughout the film that go unnoticed. The shots are staged so well they feel like a documentary, with no deliberate use of shaky cam needed.Lastly, the density of the soundtrack must be noted. There is a never ending barrage of gunfire, explosions, objects flying in the air, footsteps, weapons being loaded, and on. The immersion of the sound (again with the advantage of hearing it on a well tuned sound system in a theatre) makes the experience even more intense. Such as the quiet rumble of German tanks approaching. The spare music score gives the perfect backing when the moment requires it.The 2 hour and 49 minute running time goes quickly, with each set piece as part of the journey providing something new and intriguing as the squad of soldiers encounter the war. The longer script gives character depth, and glances at small details that might have been otherwise excised for time.I give this film a 9 out of 10, and is not only one of Spielberg's all time best films, but a timeless work on it's own. How would I rate it as one of the best war films? I would put it up there with perhaps ""Patton"", but I believe, that every well made film about war can each provide a unique insight into war. Such as ""Apocalypse Now"" is one the best war films in the way it shows the perversity of war.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Best war movie of all-time, 2nd favorite film!!",War is Hell! This movie rocked. The opening scene of the movie was the best on the Omaha Beach. The action kicked ass and the battles of the entire film was phenomenal but not only that the plot was as great as can be. About Capt. John Miller and seven soldiers looking for just one other soldier who all of his brothers were killed and return him back home. The movie was also deeply sad and I kept feeling sorry for the soldiers and I always felt that I wanted to just go into the movie and fight for U.S. This is the best war movie of all time and it will remain the same unless some other comes up and overpass it but for now this is a masterpiece!!!10/10!!!Highly Recommend,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
So good you forget that it is a war movie,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. I can watch it over and over again. It also has one of my favorite actors of all time, Tom Hanks. This movie should have been Tom Hanks 5th Oscar but for some reason the 'academy' has some bias against him.Many people have said that the start of this movie is the most intense, realistic capture of the invasion of Normandy beach. In addition the shooting of the first part of the movie puts you inside the action along with stunning 5 channel sound that places bullets, bombs and screams all around you.Does not stop there there is plenty of action in this movie. It shows many sides of humanity during the war and you even see the impact of all sides US forces, German forces and by standing citizens.This movie to me was the best film of 1998. Unfortunately 1998 was one of the most competitive Oscar runs in history. Titanic, Shakespeare in love, Elizabeth and Life is beautiful all competed that year. And as always the Lovey-dovey movies mostly win the Oscar races.Still this movie was so great that it spawned a HBO miniseries that was equally great ""Band of Brothers"".This is my favorite movie from Spielberg.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

I can't wait for my son to be old enough to sit and watch it with me :) I don't think any other movie about war would even come close to Saving Private Ryan. Tom Hanks and Matt Damon were a good pair, and would be good to pair up again! I recommend this movie to A LOT of my friends. They come back and tell me that it was remarkable, then they tell other people to watch it.

BANG - fizz,"Overall, this is a well made film that is not well written.  Sure the opening scenes (Normandy) are dramatic and touch you deeply, but as soon as the allies secure the beach, the movie begins to fail.Surely there is a better script for a film about WWII in the European theater that would have served as a good vehicle for the dramatic first half-hour in this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Littoral,"Every once in a while, I go back to watch films that were celebrated in their time. These have to be films I saw when they were newly nested in their warm buzz, and which were conveyed as if they were a privilege. This is such a film, one that can perhaps serve even as the exemplar.It was touted as (at last) a serious film by Spielberg, chapter two of his ""real"" film which marketed the holocaust. It had Hanks, who it should be recalled was more uniquely respected then than now. It dealt with a sort of real history with direct pulls on patriotism and something called valor, in a way that would make Sinatra and Wayne blush (or at least hiccup).And its first 20 minutes was chocked full of effects that worked and conveyed a meaning of confused dread. It moved us all  how could it not?  and allowed the filmmaker to lazily move through an ordinary story, staged as if it had a different production crew.Seeing this again in my own context and with the objectiveness of distance, I am amazed at how effective that opening section is, and how typically bad Steven the rest is. That first part is tense, tight and close. It is horrible without forcing us so close that we recoil.You know, one of the biggest challenges in film-making is to introduce the audience to the world they will live in for perhaps a few hours  the film and the long tail of recalled experience afterward. Usually the filmmaker has only a few minutes. Some  especially when a strict genre film is coming  can even do it during the title sequence. We are prepared for this entry voyage; it is part of the contract we make when allowing a filmmaker to transport us. I cannot recall a film that took this much time to prepare us. Perhaps ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but that setup was disjointed.So I have to admire Spielberg's craft in putting together a session that has impact, though it is all tone and no narrative. And I have to admire his ability to understand and exploit that twilight area where we are primed for such a thing. And then 20 minutes in, we start to ask why, why engage us? Why open us to be ready for something that matters and serve us bread?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Drama
One of the greatest war movies I've seen,"The first 20 minutes of this film is a brutal glimpse into the violence and complete uselessness of war. We see people getting gunned down, limbs getting blown off, people blown in half, guts everywhere, it is not a pretty sight. It's this, and many other things, that make this one of the greatest war films I've ever seen.Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men are sent on a mission to recover Private James Ryan (Matt Damon). Along the way many hardships are faced and overcome between these men.That is pretty much the plot, but the movie is more than plot. It is a journey through World War II's harshness and a journey with these men. We come to care for these men. They aren't given huge amounts of development, but they don't need it. The actors really make us care for these people, as does Steven Spielberg's skillful directing. This is definitely one of his best movies.It is also a lot different. If any of his movies contain violence, there is very little of it. This, however, contains some of the most graphic violence I've ever seen. It truly shows the violence, dirtyness and uselessness of war. It doesn't offer anything but pain and misery. John William's score also creates a very suitable mood.The only reasons I have for deducting the half a star is because of the very start and the very end. The American flag flapping in the distance was a little too sentimental for me and I found it unnecessary.4½/5.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Steven Spielberg salutes the Veterans of World War II,"""Seen through the eyes of a squad of American soldiers, the story begins with World War II's historic D-Day invasion, then moves beyond the beach as the men embark on a dangerous special mission. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Faced with impossible odds, the men question their orders. Why are eight men risking their lives to save just one? Surrounded by the brutal realities of war, each man searches for his own answer - and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, decency and courage,"" according to the film's official synopsis.Once again, the Steven Spielberg and his crew of filmmakers climb to the top of the mountain, and deliver a terrific motion picture. This time, it's a heart-tugging pro-war (significantly, pro-World War II) epic of astonishing power. Initially, ""Saving Private Ryan"" impresses with its violent depiction of the Allies' D-Day landing, on the shores of German-occupied France. With waves of blood, Mr. Spielberg shows the human cost of defeating Fascism - by what TV anchorman Tom Brokaw called ""The Greatest Generation""; although, honestly, every generation has its greatest, this is a fitting term.Captain Hanks and his squad - Edward Burns (as Reiben), Jeremy Davies (as Upham), Vin Diesel (as Caparzo), Adam Goldberg (as Mellish), Barry Pepper (as Jackson), Giovanni Ribisi (as Wade), and Tom Sizemore (as Horvath) - are among the few to survive the invasion; and, are ordered to save Mr. Damon's ""Ryan"" (for the reasons given above). During quieter times, the personalities of the men emerge, with Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat creatively painting human portraits. The silhouette of the ""war mother"" dropping to her stoop as the military vehicle approaches is one of the film's most simple, and effective, portraits; it supports the film's prime directive.Hanks and the men are a more complicated literary group of characters than they seem. Spielberg is obviously manipulating the story through them; and, their strongly-directed, natural performances help make it work. The film's main message is delivered by schoolteacher Hanks' ""Miller"" in his final words to student Damon's ""Ryan""; listen for them. And, don't miss the secondary message, told by Mr. Davies' multilingual ""Upham"" character; especially, watch how he pleads with Hanks to set a German hostage free, and note the consequences of their action.It's tough to rank performances in an ""ensemble acting"" film (they're all stellar), but, for literary greatness, you've got to add Mr. Ribisi's doctor ""Wade"" to most memorable list. He tells an incredibly introspective story about how he pretended to be sleeping when his mother would peak into his room; note, eventually, Ribisi goes home to ""Mama"". Also interesting is how Mr. Sizemore's ""Horvath"" serves as the ""voice"" of Spielberg/Rodat, exalting and purifying Hanks' character. He says both the film's title and tag-line (""Except this time, the mission is a man"").Spielberg's use of ""flashback"" is one of the best you'll ever see; and, he definitively defines the term ""gut-wrenching decision.""********** Saving Private Ryan (7/24/98) Steven Spielberg ~ Tom Hanks, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, Giovanni Ribisi",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Gets more impressive every time I see it. The most intense true to life depiction of combat ever recorded on the silver screen. Steven Spielberg masterpiece!,"Steven Spielberg's masterpiece. Tom Hanks most magnificent performance. Winner of 5 Oscars and more than 70 other prizes worldwide. Unprecedented true to life combat photography. Dynamic 3 hour long story that elevates this movie into the best tribute to all those American soldiers who died fighting for freedom in Europe during World War II. This is THE ultimate depiction of D-Day when the Americans freed western Europe. What a tragic and bleak, yet glorious epic war classic!The story is literally about the rescuing behind enemy lines of an American soldier called Ryan, played by Matt Damon in a small supporting role. Tom Hanks has to rescue the guy with a team of specially selected soldiers, among which are Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel. Their journey to find and rescue private Ryan is a long, bleak and bloody one, in which soldiers are normal people with nervous breakdowns who go mental when confronted with so much cruel violence. This is not a gung ho funny action movie, this is how it really could have happened, with all the bleak and twisted soul shattering fears that soldiers have to conquer mentally, when they are in combat.The photography is stunning. Like I have never seen it before. Seen this movie many times now and it bewilders me every time how they have achieved such a level of true to life war combat photography. Even if you might not like the story, which I would find hard to believe, the action photography on itself is worthy of an Oscar, which it deservedly got.The soundtrack is dark and glorious. The sound effects were sonically blasting my ears when the tanks started rolling and the mortar shells were exploding all around. Editing is done with a fever pitch that keeps me glued to the screen. I can go on and on about the superb technical skills with which this movie was made, but the most important thing is that this movie has a got a pulsating righteous heart at it's core. This movie touches me profoundly. Only a few times during the last 40 years, have I ever been this fascinated by a war movie. Incredibly impressive!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
How can someone make such a movie...,To begin I have to admit that this is one of the best war movies ever made. No doubt Tom Hanks is splendid and he shows a real devoted patriot soldier who cares for his family as much as his mother country. The war scenes are excellent. One can hardly believe that it is a movie because the way they have pictured the film is more like a documentary. The bloodshed at the beginning of the film and the cemetery yard with all the white crosses takes you up to the heaven. It is too rare that one watches this movie and doesn't get shocked. Shocked to see so many innocent boys killed at war and all this in vain because The US has begun other wars in Asia and other sites. So FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THOSE PATRIOT BOYS AND ALL CAPTIAN MILLERS DO NOT RAGE ANOTHER WAR TO KILL AMERICA'S SONS,10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Spielberg's best film to date!,"I first saw this film in the movie theater. The beginning of the Normandy landing has not left my mind. It is one of the most spectacular introduction to the film. You have a cast that includes Spielberg's favorite actor, Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Paul Giamati, one of my personal favorites-Rolf Saxon in a non-speaking role. This film is mostly a male-dominated film with little or no romance. SPielberg's best asset is creating a spectacular image and this time, the landing on Normandy was not for the easily sickened. You will see the graphic display of the horror on that day which is what we should see. HE does not shy away from showing us human brutality at its worst but he later shows it at it's best. I didn't care much for the title about them rescuing one soldier to bring home. I wanted Steven Spielberg to know that this is his best film to date about World War II even surpassing Schindler's List which I felt was inferior to this film. The script was superb, the movie is just a breathtaking spectacle to date. It still should be seen in the movie theaters to show the effects and brutality and to remind us about how cruel war is on any level. he won the Oscar for best director but after seeing Shakespeare in Love, there is no doubt in my mind that Saving Private Ryan was robbed of Best Film.

An undisputed classic of the war genre,"It'd be implausible to think that anyone who wasn't involved in World War 2 could ever understand the true horrors or hardship the men and women of the time went through in that terrible time. Over the years we've had countless documentaries, novels, movies, games and TV series that have looked to offer an insight into what it felt like to be a part of the World War that claimed millions upon millions of lives, and arguably the most visceral and heart pounding take of them all is Steven Spielberg's incredible Saving Private Ryan.A film unlike anything Spielberg had made before or has made since, Ryan, with it's as close to real opening stanza on the beaches of Normandy and journey culminating in a speaker shattering finale in the crumbled ruins of the city of Ramelle, is a downright masterstroke of movie making craft that to this day near 20 years on from its initial release has lost none of its impressive and heartfelt power.Spielberg accomplished his impressive feat by surrounding himself with the cream of the crop of film-making wizards. Employing the services of now famed cinematographer Janusz Kaminski who single-handedly reinvented the way in which war films and action in particular was shot, the keen eye of long standing editor Michael Kahn, the screen writing abilities of The Patriot scribe Robert Rodat and of course the musical accompaniment of a John Williams score, Ryan had at its disposal the A-team of Hollywood and it shows.All around Saving Private Ryan is quality, pure unbridled grace and confidence that fills the film's every frame and it extends to its eclectic cast of established and at-the-time up and comers which was led by the almost never better Tom Hanks. After Hanks' leading man Captain Miller we have Ed Burns's cocky Reiban, Barry Pepper's religiously inclined sharpshooter Jackson, the late Tom Sizemore's gruff Horvath, Adam Goldberg's wisecracking Mellish and Jeremy Davis's jittery language expert Upham. It's a great team and when you throw in Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and of course cinemas most rescued, Matt Damon with added bit parts by a one armed Walter White in the form of Bryan Cranston, a slim lined Paul Giamatti, a non-CSI Ted Danson and even a baby faced Nathan Fillion, Ryan acts as a who's who of recognizable actors that each for a small period or large period made sure the film was one of the most well-acted of the modern era.Filled with heart, stunningly filmed sequences of confronting warfare and a cast of memorable personnel, Saving Private Ryan is one of a handful of quintessential war films that have managed to somehow in various states capture what it may have been like to be among the countless wars that have raged over our planet in years gone by.A deserving Oscar winner that in many ways can be seen as a faultless exercise in big budget film-making and the perfect example of a men on a mission movie done well, Saving Private Ryan is one of, if not the greatest film in Steven Spielberg's outstanding and loaded filmography.5 greased up socks out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good start fading to muddy end,"The first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan is probably the most realistic depiction of war and the invasion of Normandy ever made. That being said, the plot is far fetched and the story drags out for while without anything really happening. There is very little character development and many of the characters you never really get to know all that very well.The last combat scene of the movie does not live up to the first. It was very disappointing to me personally. In reality the German military was highly trained and professional. In this movie they are reduced to cannon fodder in the last 25 min. It seems to me there was two different directors on this movie - one for the first half and one for the second half.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"WAR, huh, what is it good for?","This is one of the single worst films I have ever seen.  Spielberg was, once again, intoxicated by his own sense of patriotic splendour. The first major flaw in this film struck me the first time I saw it.  I was in the theater and began to ask myself, ""How could Ryan remember the D-Day invasion when in fact he was never there?""Now, honestly, how did Spielberg expect to get away with that one? It was never explained or followed up in any way. Secondly, how did he expect to get away with portraying the Germans as mindless, blood-thirsty grunts?  ""Well they were, weren't they?"" says the blindly patriotic american.  This aspect of the film is a disgrace to Germans and more importantly to the brain-washed americans. Finally, I would just like to point out the fact that this was not a war to rescue individual men in order to preserve their family line. This film makes a mockery of WWII by completely misrepresenting it.  The only aspect that was accurately portrayed was the violence, which sadly enough drew many people to the film.

Yet still I was not prepared for the horror that I was exposed to for the next 2 1/2 hours. Horror is the only way to describe this film. I wasn't simply watching the film. I was absorbed into it. Steven Spielberg is arguably the most famous film director out there, and for good reason too. He can make a film like no one else. Everything here works so well, the acting, the action sequences, the atmosphere and emotion. It's all here, and highly energized. This, along with Schindler's List, one of the greatest films in cinematic history. is Spielberg's masterpiece. One of the main reasons this film works is his cinematographer Janusz Kiminski. The grit of the camera sets up the atmosphere perfectly, and the lighting is superb because even when it's a sunny day, it's still covered in darkness. People have criticized this film for having a bad storyline. That's not true, not at all. While the storyline is simple and nothing new, it's because that's what it would have been like in real life. Life is not a intricately woven storyline like say The Silence of the Lambs, and the people with this film know that. The key to making this film work is making it real.

"Bleak, horrific, magnificent","There are few movies in history that can deeply affect us and leave an undeniable emotional impression. This film is one such. I can remember exiting the theater on weak knees, not from sitting for so long, but from the emotional turmoil it caused.Certainly an average Joe like myself who has never served in the military nor ever faced combat cannot truly fathom the horror of war. But since a number of WWII combat veterans who viewed the film were impressed by its realism, I can safely say that my feelings in leaving the theater were more than justified.It's easy to criticize a war movie for being limited in scope, as Ryan was, but in my opinion it makes for a much more visceral, intense, and satisfying movie experience. Some films, like ""Patton,"" ""The Longest Day,"" ""Midway,"" and a number of others have tried to better represent the monumental undertaking that was WWII. While I commend such efforts, the focus therein is too broad - one cannot appreciate the individual sacrifice and emotion involved, and it's easy to get lost in the numerous characters and distracted by the overall scope of the film.Ryan focused not only on one theater of the war, but in one geographically small area. Additionally, it is seen through the eyes of a small squad of American soldiers. I would not have wanted it any other way.Spielberg has outdone himself here, spotlighting his artistic range and re-affirming why he is one of the greatest of American film directors. Be warned - this is likely among the most intense war films of all time, and is not for the weak of stomach or heart.But unlike many of the sanitized war movies of the past, this one gives us a taste, however small, of what must have been a truly terrifying and devastating experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The movie is intense, but is important to watch. The cast does a great job. They put this feeling on you that is hard to describe. In my opinion this is one Spielberg's best films. He does a great job of showing the intensity of battle between men, the struggle for survival. He also does a great job of adding some comic relief to make the film seem a little lighter. This is one of my favorite movies because of the action, plot, and acting. At the end of this film you might feel sad, but not disturbed. This film made me feel very patriotic and proud of the country I live in. It also makes me appreciate all the men who went through so much in order to maintain world peace. If you have a strong stomach and are a big fan of war movies, I highly recommend this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The greatest film ever.,"Saving Private Ryan has to be one of the greatest films of all time and is personally my favorite movie ever. Steven Spielberg has captured war as it really is. All detail is considered to make this movie one of the most, if not the most accurate war film ever created. The actors performances are brilliant especially that of Tom Hanks. This movie really focuses on each of the characters and the mind of a soldier in which many other war movies fail to capture. After watching this film I have now gained a greater knowledge of what war really consists of and therefore gained a greater respect for those veterans who served during D-Day especially and in general WWII. I would very much recommend it to anyone.One of Spielbergs best.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"a postmodern antiwar film, self-conscious, deeply flawed","The subversive postmodernism couldn't be more obvious, no almost no one notices, so corrupted are we by the malaise of pacificist impotence. The whole concept of basing a film against the very flow of D-Day--the ""heroes"" are not there to win anything, they're there only to drag someone out. While thousands of Americans, Brits, Aussies, Canadians, Free French and others are dying fighting Hitler's army and Luftwaffe, Spielberg is leading a campaign of mighty forces to pull a lone American out of the combat zone no matter what the cost. To use the world's greatest invasion from the sea as the mere backdrop to a story is, to me, perverse, and trivializes the extraordinary efforts both of the men who fought during the Normandy invasions and the earlier generation of filmmakers who sought to portray that effort on a grand, much nobler canvas.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Immensely Overrated,"So many people loved this film, that I actually rented the DVD to re-watch it. I had originally seen it in a movie theater, during its initial release, and I hated it. The second time was certainly not a charm. Possessing the knowledge of what was to come, made for an even more boring movie experience. This film's much talked about opening, lends nothing to the paltry narrative that is the rest of the film. The movie meanders about, aimlessly, for what seems an eternity, and almost nothing happens. When something does happen, it isn't anything that you haven't seen, done by the same old characters that you've seen before, in countless other (and better) WWII films. Even the dialog is old Hollywood corny. Then, after being about virtually nothing for hours, it ends with a hokey gimmick of the realization of who the old Vet is. Meant to tug at our heartstrings (nothing wrong with that); but only elicited a groan and a roll of the eyes from me. Tedious, with virtually no character development. Not Recommended.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

What about their parents, wifes, girlfriends and children?Please! It's has realistic battle and death scenes. That's all.",,Anonymous,Drama
Grabbed me and didn't let go,"There is a distinct difference I always notice with war movies compared to action movies. In war movies, no matter how many rounds are fired or how many explosions occur, every single bullet and every single explosion seems significant. In your typical Hollywood action movie I almost wholly ignore bullets and explosions because they are usually of no consequence. However, in war movies every bullet holds my attention as does every explosion. ""Saving Private Ryan"" cast a particularly strong spell on me where I was totally drawn in.""Saving Private Ryan"" grabbed a hold of me so tight I could barely breathe. From the very beginning it had a death grip on me; just letting up a tad in the middle and resuming its bear hug until the final scene.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Another Spielberg's Masterpiece,"There is no war movie so powerful, so special, so amazing, so impactful, so long but incredible, than 2 hours and 50 minutes of Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, it's not like watching a movie, it's like watching a real war with an amazing camera work that always follow the soldier wherever they go, we are like one of them but we can't do anything besides watching them in pain and die, Spielberg's did it again, making another Masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A thank you to all veterans,"Growing up, I knew that my family had a lot of history in the United States Marine Corps and the U.S. Army. My grandfather and his brother were soldiers in the Pacific, and my grandmother's brothers were Marines alongside them. My grandfather would often be asked about what happened over there, and he always just bowed his head, swallowed hard, and told half truths and ""beside-the-point"" stories to appease whoever asked- never truly telling any of us what he and his fellow Americans were- heroes.I had often wondered myself why my grandfather wouldn't talk about WWII, but one day in my U.S. History class in high school I got my answer. This film opened my eyes to the horrors of war. I sat in shock as the gore exploded in front of me, wondering how soldiers and Marines like those in my family lived- or whats more, were able to cope with the events that made them heroes.My point with all of this is that in this day and age, we as a society are so accustomed to violence that we don't really realize what fighting men go through in times of war. We see ""10 soldiers killed in Iraq"" on the news, but it doesn't really register to us as civilians. This was Spielburg's goal in making this film. He wanted to show all of us what fighting men go through for us- you and me. Every American Citizen should see this film to truly understand what it takes to keep us safe.As far as the film itself goes, it is absolutely amazing. No film is perfect, but the actors are incredibly convincing in their roles. The emotion is there, the battle recreations are realistic and as they were in life, and the cinematography is outstanding. It's very obvious that everyone involved with this film was dedicated to making it a tribute to the veterans and it is without any shadow of a doubt, the best war movie ever made.One thing to note is that this is NOT a film for your kids or a film to watch casually. It is intense and should be treated as such.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Movie That Changed Everything,"It is quite rare that a movie comes along that has the ability to connect to its audiences on such a human level. For even the most ""advanced"" film fanatics, the movie-watching experience is usually tethered to the moment: You watch the movie, either like it or don't, and then it slowly fades away as life intercedes. In the case of ""Saving Private Ryan"", though, Steven Spielberg changed an entire's nations attitudes and actions towards a single historical event (WW2).For a basic plot summary, this film drops viewers (quite literally) into D-Day, with a prolonged battle scene that depicts the assault on Normandy. After the company led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) comes out on the other side, they are given a special mission from ""upper management"": A mother back in the U.S. has just been informed that three of her sons were killed in action. A fourth, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) is still active in the fight. Miller's goal? Get Ryan out of the war and back to his mother. Is all this effort worth it for one man? Will anyone make it out of the war alive? Those are the questions that Ryan and his men grapple with on the road to find Ryan.When ""Saving Private Ryan"" premiered in the summer of 1998, many veterans were so moved by the opening D-Day sequence that they had to leave the theater and compose themselves. It was that much of an emotional experience for them, yet Spielberg treats it with such respect that it never seems like ""emotional sabotage"" or anything like that. It was just the first time that audiences had ever been treated to such a graphic, true-to-form visage of battle. No disrespect to any of the war flicks that preceded it, but ""Ryan"" didn't pull any punches.Like I said, this is a movie that changed perceptions. After viewing this visceral film, many children and grand-children of WW2 vets began asking their parents/grandparents about the war experience. While an uncomfortable topic, to be sure, it was a dialogue that needed to be opened in order to better understand the members of the ""Greatest Generation"". For so many years, WW2 vets had lived ""in silence"", so to speak, about their war experiences, only relating to their war companions (as they were the only people who could relate). What Spielberg did, though, was bring the topic to the forefront of conscious, allowing WW2 vets an avenue for relating their experiences to the current culture.If I were to start a list of the most important movies ever made from a cultural standpoint, ""Saving Private Ryan"" would perhaps top that list. Not only does it have great action/plot/characters from a film-making standpoint, but it is an experience that can stick with a person forever and change lives.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Visually rich with a stunning and honest depiction of war,"Many of us can't truly say we know what World War II looked like, but I would venture to say that Steven Spielberg gives us a pretty good idea with ""Saving Private Ryan."" Spielberg, in his second attempt to capture the WWII era on the big screen, has made a movie that plays out like the telling of a war story and in the combat scenes latching back on to a sense of harsh reality with violence and the death of many soldiers.Worthy of the most praise is the incredibly well-deserved second Oscar win for the team of Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski. The two have done everything together and this is certainly a high point of their partnership. The cinematography really captures a war that is both dark and in the case of D-Day, legendary. Rarely do most films capture a spirit of war that is scary and also beautiful without glorifying the war or its soldiers.Here is wear ""Ryan"" succeeds as a truly strong war film and probably the best depiction of World War II battle in history. The characters are strong and while they seem to be more like characters when they don't fight, they react like people when they are forced to do their jobs, not like super soldiers with the exception of Barry Pepper's character, but that only makes the film better by rounding out the way different soldiers viewed the war.The themes are incredibly strong thanks to this depiction of violence. The universal idea of fighting for something or obeying orders when you don't understand why is perfectly interpolated by the band of soldiers sent to find Private Ryan and in that way it requires every viewer to forcibly reconcile that which a soldier in any war must do. Those of us who aren't veterans should consider ourselves fortunate to only have to ponder it and not actually come to terms with it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"still, it does seem that they could have looked at more","I would have given ""Saving Private Ryan"" a higher score had it looked at more issues abundant during WWII (they could have focused on the various roles that each country specifically played in the war). But don't get me wrong: watching the movie, you can literally feel the bullets hitting you. Tom Hanks commands as strong a performance as we can expect him to, and the rest of the cast also does quite well.I guess that if the movie has any problems, it's in the characters themselves. Aside from the fact that the movie pretty much makes all Americans out to be good and all Germans out to be bad, the Americans are basically clichés. They're all wholesome, hard-working guys out to make something of themselves. Moreover, there's the wise-guy New Yorker and the cowpoke Southerner, and Pvt. Ryan comes from Iowa (read: America's heartland).But otherwise, it's a very good movie, and it goes to show what an incredible director Steven Spielberg is (although I still wouldn't have given the movie Best Picture; I would have given that to ""Life is Beautiful"").

FUBAR,"I watched this film the first time when it was released in 1998. I was 44 years old (2 years older than Tom Hanks) at that time. I watched it again recently. In both instances, the thrill that I experienced watching it didn't diminish a bit. It's truly a classic and perhaps the best war
movie ever made.Film technology has advanced so much since 1998. But as a movie buff with little technical knowhow on filmmaking, the movie's technical qualities didn't seem to age. It still looks good on the screen now despite the passage of time.The 2 action sequences, on the beach in Normandy and in the town defending a bridge, are a couple of the best extended sequences I've ever watched. Yet, it's not just the raw action or the realism that has earned plaudits from film critics. It's the quiet drama that unfolds as the Ranger company goes on its way looking for Pvt. James Ryan. (Matt Damon was only 28 when this film was released back then.) Those whispered simple words of Capt. John Miller to shell-shocked Ryan are immortal: earn this...earn it.War is really FUBAR.

Glorifies American exceptionalism on the world stage,"It starts with D-Day landings on Omaha Beach in 1944. Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) leads a squad on to the beach, losing numerous men but achieving his objective. When he reports, he is directed to a different kind of assignment -- to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), a young recruit from rural Iowa whose three brothers have just been killed in combat within the past week. The objective is to get him out of combat and sent home.The movie follows Captain Miller and a small portion of his squad as they try to find Ryan, who is part of the 101st Airborne, and whose location is not really known. The squad faces various challenges in their search, and two men are killed in the process.Finally, they locate Ryan, part of a small group trying to defend a small village bridge against attack by a much larger German force. Ryan refuses to leave. Captain Miller and his men stay and help defend the bridge. A severe battle ensues in which Miller and most of his men are killed, but Ryan survives. The closing scene shows Ryan 50 years later in Normandy's war cemetery visiting Miller's grave and wondering if his life has warranted Miller's sacrifice.The film was mostly highly praised and received all kinds of Academy Award nominations. It was especially praised for the reality of its battle scenes, which are actually quite difficult to watch. I cringed many times during these lengthy scenes. Purists quibbled about both the Americans' and Germans' tactical mistakes in the climactic battle scenes near the end. Some also complained the movie made it seem that only Americans were part of the D-Day landings.One academic critic said the film degenerated into a harmless, uncritical patriotic performance apparently designed to thrill 12-year-old boys during the summer bad-film season.I mostly agree with that critic. Yes, we see some bad behavior by American soldiers, but by and large, they come through stoutly at the end, including the young translator who cowered during most of the last battle. ""Saving Private Ryan"" does not glorify war, but it does glorify American exceptionalism on the world stage.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Another generic mind numbing con-job from spielberg,"OOOOH! Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks!  It has to be good! And that is why so many fools actually think this movie is worth something; they were told it was before they ever saw it.  Tom Hanks playing the same character he has in every movie since ""Philidelphia"" sans ""Forrest Gump."" Spielberg trying to make us think this movie is as realistic as they get. Lots of bullets, blood, and heads blowing apart does not mean it qualifies as real.  It can't be real.  We've seen all of these characters in a hundred other movies.  Tough, tobacco chewing sergeant.  Cynical, mouthy private. Even the sniper getting shot through the scope.  Spielberg is ripping of a schlock tom berringer joint.

Pay attention!,"Just a couple of things :first of all I would like to say that ""History is written by winners"", please think about that. Hollywood productions don't give any objective account of WW2.Regarding ""Saving Private Ryan"" : at the beginning of the movie 2 hundred *poor* Americans are ruthlessly slaughtered by a punch of faceless ""Huns"" who are defending the beach. At the end of the movie an *heroic* punch of Americans are defending a bridge by killing 2 hundred SS and by destroying 2 Tiger tanks with sticky bombs (!) and hand-thrown mortar ammunitions (!!).In both cases Germans are dumb and on the wrong side, either as killers or as victims!It is my opinion that soldiers of both armies were equally forced to fight by orders from above and inspired by boastful belief. There is nothing really heroic in war.If you want to find a more believable perspective of operation Overlord try Max Hasting's book ""Overlord"" (1984). You'll learn much more about the poor performance of American infantry and ""evil"" Germans' fighting prowess.",,Anonymous,Drama
War is hell after all...,"It seemed impossible (or was it inevitable?), but director Steven Spielberg did the unthinkable: he made a war movie. The creative and legendary mind behind such kiddie movies like ""E.T. the Extraterrestrial"" (1982) or ""Hook"" (1991) and who had ventured into more mature territory with ""Schindler's List"" (1993) made a movie that put a human face on the horrors of the World War II conflict. We know how personal WWII is to Spielberg (especially to anyone who's seen ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" - he just loves to stick it those diabolical Nazis, or the aforementioned ""Schindler's List""), but after seeing ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), our assertions at just HOW personal it is to him are revealed. Opening on D-Day (June 6, 1944) at Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, the grainy cinematography and jerky camera movements are relentlessly imposing in capturing the graphic battlefield carnage of that day. We watch in horror as one after one, Allied soldiers are butchered by the automatic weapons being unloaded on them by the Germans that had taken up positions on the hills in front of them. In the middle of the chaos, is Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), as he leads his men from the sandy, bullet and body-riddled beach up to the top of the hill. In the scenes that follow, Spielberg is unflinching as we see American soldiers as well Germans become the casualties of history's costliest conflict. The movie doesn't end there; it's only the beginning and the main plot of the film, which is supposedly based on a true story, takes shape. It turns out, that an American mother is going to receive three telegrams in one day, each one informing her that her three sons have all been killed in the D-Day invasion. But there is hope: her fourth son, a paratrooper, the eponymous Private Ryan (Matt Damon, in what could essentially be considered a cameo) of the film's title, survived. The problem is, he's located deep behind enemy lines, and it'll take a small squad of American soldiers to bring him home, as word of this small victory will serve the army good on the home front. Miller leads his squad, which includes Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Reiben (Edward Burns), Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), T-4 Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and the unproven translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies), deep into the French countryside to rescue Private Ryan and bring him home. It should be stated foremost that this is not an easy movie to sit through. I remember hearing stories from when this film first came about out how WWII veterans who were at D-Day had to be escorted out of the theaters because it was too much for them to handle. But still, that is its goal: ""Saving Private Ryan"" is the most realistic, gritty, and horrifically violent war movie I've ever seen. It does the impossible task of shedding itself of the stigmas (patriotic flag-waving, one-dimensional soldiers, one-sided portraits of the enemy, no battle-related carnage, etc.) that haunted many WWII films made during the '50s and '60s; contrary to some reviews, none of this goes on in this film. The film is immediately effective in its portrait of soldiers on both sides of the WWII battle, and the cost it waged on them. The performances are flawless, as Spielberg is able to get commanding talent out of all the actors involved. The action, if you can sit through it, will definitely make you squirm in your seat at how realistic it is. It should also be noted that nearly every war film since this one has tried to mimic the style of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but they can't ever live up to its originality and raw intensity. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is Spielberg's WWII masterpiece, and is my favorite war movie. It's no wonder Spielberg was voted #1 director of all time; this film proves why.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A better story and less sentimentality (everyone understands that young men being blow to pieces is a tragedy and this need not be pointed out by the director.

One of the best war movies ever...,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of those movies that you can watch with regular intervals of time, and even if you've seen it multiple times and am familiar with the storyline, the movie is solid enough to be watched over and over, and keeps on being entertaining.The story, quickly summarized, is about a small squad of soldiers during the 2nd World War who are given a mission to find private Ryan in war-torn Europe after having survived the D-Day onslaught at Omaha Beach.What makes ""Saving Private Ryan"" good, is a combination of multiple things. First, of course, is the storyline. But also the way it is filmed, which puts the audience right in the midst of the action. Most importantly, though, is the more than impressive cast who perform above and beyond the call of duty so to speak, no pun intended.The action is formidable and impressive, showing that war is brutal and bloody. And it is presented in a very realistic manner, again adding to the conviction of the entire movie.The cast list for ""Saving Private Ryan"" was impressive. And there is a number of actors who really prove their acting talents and break out of the stereotypical roles and genres they tend to cling to. Tom Hanks, of course, is the center of the movie and he fitted so well into the role and the movie. Usually I am not particularly fond of Tom Sizemore, but he was perfect for this movie and did a great job. Ted Danson was a breath of fresh air, and he was a great addition to the movie, as were Paul Giamatti. Barry Pepper was phenomenal in his role and brought a good amount of flavor to the movie. However, for me, it was Jeremy Davies who was the most outstanding of all in the movie, proving once again what a phenomenal character actor he is.And it is always a plus when Germans actually do speak German in a World War 2 movie, and not have those awful German accents added when they in fact are speaking English.""Saving Private Ryan"" is a movie experience that everyone should have, at least once.

"A solid film, very well made, but with some weaknesses.","This film is located in Northern France during the Allied landing in Normandy and the weeks following it.

Skydiver somewhere in northern France. Only recently, after some research, did I discover that the film was based, very slightly, on a real event. The script is good, full of action scenes and will surely delight the lovers of war movies and WWII movies. Personally, I highlight the opening scenes, in which ""D-Day"" was recreated in all its raw glory, and the final part, where it all comes together in an almost perfect climax of action.The director's chair was taken by iconic Steven Spielberg, who is spotless once again. He is one of those directors who no longer has to prove anything. More than established, he was already one of the best directors of our time when he directed this movie. Even so, he did not cease to strive and to provide us with careful, attentive and thoughtful direction. At his side, in the starring role, Tom Hanks in one of the films that marked his career. Hanks is a renowned actor. Attentive to detail and emotional when it has to be, she shone once more, earning another Oscar nomination for Best Actor (though attributed to the equally remarkable Roberto Benigni, in one of the most hilarious and emotional moments the Academy ceremony has ever seen. in many decades). The supporting cast is equally good, containing names like Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Matt Damon, Paul Giamatti, etc. Actors who, as we can see, are established and generally have solid careers today.The film shone equally on the technical details. It's a Spielberg movie, and we couldn't expect anything else. Let's look at the careful way in which the historical details were mostly recreated. The uniforms, military equipment, combat tactics were all carefully studied, and despite some flaws (such as the predominance of the Americans and the absence of other allies in the theater of war), all went well. I especially liked that they used the German language for the German soldiers. I also highlight the excellent photography, with breathtaking scenes and original camera angles (one moment we are looking through a sniper sight, and the next moment a bullet crosses that same sight towards us, to name but a few). an example), as well as the sound effects, with all those absolutely realistic bullet sounds and shots. The characterization, the special effects, the soundtrack ... all meticulously well done.Personally, I liked this movie a lot. It's one of those movies that I like to see again after a few years, but which has disappeared without a trace of the television circuit, perhaps because of its length and the fact that it is no longer a new movie. It also has some minor flaws, such as some concessions to sentimental lamechas and scenes of strong emotional appeal, but I confess that I handled it very well. The scene that seemed to me the most out of context was, in fact, a passage involving a French family with their young children. Another problem with this movie is that, with the exception of the character of Hanks, most of the characters have been underdeveloped and the actors have little to work with, just playing wars.This movie has garnered several awards. Of all, I highlight his good performance at this year's Oscars, with five statuettes collected in the technical categories (Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Edition, Best Sound and Best Sound Effects). He also won the Golden Globe for Best Dramatic Film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"It's not history, although ambitious","Spielberg set out to make a realistic depiction of the Omaha Beach landings to kick off  his film, which is about a fictional mission of a squad to rescue one Pvt Ryan, of the airborne, dropped inland behind the beaches. One glaring idiocy of the film is why they would dispatch soldiers from the Omaha sector to rescue someone droppedbehind the Utah sector, especially when 4th Infantry Div soldiers arealready in contact with a large portion of the airborne troops. The answer is, of course, because that gives Spielberg his opportunity to display the Omaha landings rather than the Utah beach landings next door, which were too easy and lacked any bloody combat. If the only thing anyone knows about the V Corps landings at Omaha came from this film, then they would have been better off skipping the film, or at least the opening scenes of battle. Read a book and learn what happened at Omaha. You'll find that it wasn't anywhere near as bloody as Spielberg's film leads one to believe. Omaha Beach was considered bloody only because of comparison with landings at the other 4 beaches, which were virtually walkovers. The rest of the movie is not much to see, with many errors in the combat sequences, especially with respect to tactics that would have been used. Spielberg's film is badly flawed as history, and the story is downright unbelievable - why not radio the 101st  and order Ryan off the line? Why send a few guys to walk thru the entire German 7th Army and search in a 400 square mile area for some guy named Ryan? The US Army wasn't always the most efficient, but they would never have sent off a squad on such a cockamamie mision.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great battle scenes in an otherwise average movie,"Maybe my summary line was a bit harsh. Saving Private Ryan is not an average movie, but I don't think it's as great as the rest of the world seems to think. Yes the various battle scenes are gut-wrenching, but the movie overall was slightly disappointing.Firstly, the film is completely US-centric. I think one non-American character (a German soldier who is begging for his life at the time) gets a speaking role in the film. There is no indication that soldiers from other countries took part in the D-day landings. The American soldiers die horribly, tragically, heroically, dramatically. The German soldiers just die. Bang, grunt, thud: another dead German.We see all of the tension and fear experienced by the Americans, yet none of that which must have been felt by the opposing Germans. They were, after all, one and the same, merely servants of opposing political masters. Yet the movie completely misses the chance to humanise the enemy, to show that they too are just ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.Saving Private Ryan is, in short, a Hollywood blockbuster, with gory battle bits. The American soldiers are the human good guys, the German soldiers are the inhuman bad guys, war is Hell, but we're better at it than you.I didn't *hate* this movie, I just didn't think it was worth all of the plaudits which it has received. Tom Hanks is, of course, always watchable, the story rolls along nicely, the battle scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat (or possibly under it), and the anti-war grittiness does outweigh the pro-American good vs. bad slant. For the record, I thought the spin-off TV series Band of Brothers was marginally better.",,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing movie about a important topic!,"Amazing movie about a very serius topic! One of the things that makes Saving Private Ryan so special for me is its realism.

The conection to the caracter and the raw storytelling will probability leave you breathless.The movie showing the reality of war in all its messiness, following young men unsure of their decisions and mostly just full of fear!

Quite possibly my favorite WWII movie,"This movie was an instant classic.Everything about this movie was perfect. I could not find a single flaw in the acting, storyline, effects, etc.First, there's a perfect cast. Tom Hanks was the perfect choice to play Capt. John Miller. Tom Sizemore filled the part as Miller's ""side-kick"", Sgt. Mike Horvath very nicely. Edward Burns was very good as the antagonizing Pvt. Richard Reiben. Barry Pepper was great as the sniper, Pvt. Daniel Jackson Adam Goldberg was good as the emotional Pvt. Stanley Mellish. Giovanni Ribisi was excellent as the shy medic, Pvt. Irwin Wade. Jeremy Davies was actually funny and good at the same time playing the clutzy, peace-loving, nervous Pvt. Timothy Upham. Even Vin Diesel gave an excellent performance as the tough Pvt. Adrian Caparzo. Matt Damon was great for the limited time he was in the movie as Pvt. James Francis Ryan.The gore and special FX were first class. Everything looked so real. It was as if they were in the actual battles. D-Day landing at Dog One was particularly gory and well made. This movie must have had one hell of a huge budget, and it payed off big time.The sound score went excellent with every scene. It really made you feel for the events that were occurring.The story was also great. Usually war movies have a pointless storyline but Saving Private Ryan proves them wrong with a story of its own.This movie was perfect, Spielberg at his best. It deserves its place on the top 250.I recommend this to war/action movie fans of all kinds. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

I made sure to turn the volume up for the re-watch but it doesn't do it justice, so if you see that 'Saving Private Ryan' is playing at local art house theater, GO!The movie is a top-to-bottom masterpiece, and at this point there's nothing I can add to the discussion. It ranks 71 on AFI Top 100, which IMHO seems a little low, but it certainly deserves to be on the list.A couple of surprises which did not have meaning to me 25 years ago: Vin Diesel is in the movie, and he has a completely different voice. Also Nathan Fillion of 'Firefly' fame pops in for a cameo.If you haven't seen 'Saving Private Ryan', you should, because it's a cultural touchstone and a masterful piece of art.

Good war film but...................,"I'm usually a big fan of Spielberg,but in this film he comes across as a bit to anti-German,he may have his reasons and i think he has made them clear in Schindlers List,and i understand his feelings.But i think for a big epic like this it would have been better to have an unbiased portrayal of Germans so the film would have been universally admired,instead its coming across as anti-German propaganda especially when there is so much American flag-waving.Being English i have the same problem with Braveheart,Scots=good English=bad,this is really one dimensional character study,which just teaches people to live in ignorance,we all need to learn to move on.Surely its better to make films every culture is going to relate to,flag waving just promotes arrogance which leads to looking down on others.The other big problem i have with this film is that the Brits are not mentioned,or if we are i must have missed it,i must have blinked.This was a decisive battle and i know like thousands of other Brits we were involved,so whats the big idea?It would be like us making a film about the Somme or Ypes and not bothering to mention the Canadian and Australian involvement,that would be unforgivable.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
To the everlasting glory of the iiiiinfantry...,"I can't be the only person who thinks this is Starship Troopers with the Evil Nazi Scourge standing in for the Bugs.For one, the combat scenes are no more war-is-hell realistic and bloody than Starship Troopers.  It's nice to see protagonists who aren't superhuman, but this is only a (moderately) original take for big budget blockbusters, it's hardly ground breaking cinema.Just as in Starship Troopers, the characters barely qualify as one dimensional, and I can't be the only one who found them so irritatingly stereotypical that SPR almost qualifies as a parody.A particular point of interest is that Mr Spielberg's Evil Nazi Scourge are portrayed only slightly more sympathetically than the Bugs in Starship Troopers.  If you get your knowledge of history from Hollywood (which a lot of people do), then you'd be forgiven for thinking that every single German was a soulless Nazi who deserved to die, and that WWII was just USA vs Japan and Germany.  I do have a fair amount of sympathy for Spielberg's stance, but it's interesting to compare his sweeping generalisations with 1930's Nazi anti-Jewish, anti-Romany propaganda.  It's sad but not really surprising that Spielberg's audience accepts his skewed message just as unquestioningly as the German moviegoers did in the 1930's.The idea for SPR is actually sound, but the implementation is just so overdone that I really can't bring myself to care about any of it, other than to feel contempt for the brutal liberties it takes with history.  If I'm going to watch good-vs-bad fantasy, I'd prefer to stick with Starship Troopers which at least doesn't try to pass itself off as something significant and profound.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

The use of sound in this movie truly puts the viewer into the action. The sounds of bullets and explosions combined with the graphic, but true to life, reactions of soldiers being hit makes the horror of war seem very real to those of us who have never served in combat. Screams of soldiers for their mothers, soldiers in shock picking up their own limbs, and soldiers being vaporized by explosions are all too real.

Easily the best war movie ever made,"This is the quintessential war film. It is among the few that truly capture the impact and scale of war, while still managing to tell an amazingly put together story as well. The first 20 mins of this film is one of the most intense, insane, realistic looking things I've ever seen. Back when I watched this for the first time on Memorial Day of 2020, I don't think I'd ever seen anything quite like this before, and was not prepared at all for the sheer realism. I was still early on in my film watching days, so this really moved me. To this day, it remains my 2nd favorite movie ever. Steven Spielberg really did create a masterpiece out of this, and I'm very happy that he did. For being someone known for making all those nostalgic 80s kids type movies (like E. T., Indiana Jones, Jaws, Jurassic Park), this sure is a huge change.

Fair Review. Figured Out What Went Wrong,"The Good:
I watched this movie many times and I finally feel like I can write a fair and balance review. The first time I watched it, the movie visuals were spectacular and action sequences were compelling that kept you on the ""edge of your seat"". To Steven Spielberg's credit, the filmmaking and effects of saving private Ryan was revolutionary in that no past war movie had this amount of realism. Battle scenes were gripping and entertaining. Thats where 7 comes from.The Bad:
After rewatching it on HD, I realized what had bugged me. The German army is made up of complete morons, shouting and clucks about like headless chicken while getting shot. I will use the final battle sequence as illustration. The German army gets ambushed in a village, they get mowed down but machine gun positions and picked off by a sniper in a row, wave after wave after wave...In reality, do you really think Germans won't know to regroup after the initial shock of the ambush? You'd expect them to now see that there's an US machine gun position ahead or sniper picking your buddies off. There were plenty of buildings or rubble for germans to find cover. But no! Let's charge down the same narrow path where you buddies were gunned down moments ago and expect different results.I will admit that, the quality of the German army of 1944 was no longer the same as the German army of 1941. There were, however, still veteran troops, and they were not suicidal idiots as portrayed.In conclusion, movie visuals were spectacular. Script was lackluster. Portrayal of the German lack believability upon closer inspection. Just an expertly done ""propaganda"".",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Excellent WW II drama with tearjerker ending.,"All wars are different but some contain similar elements. I was in Tet-68 and can relate to many of the attitudes in this picture. I also had a father that was in WWII. So, we compared stories.Because of the nature of the movie and the Spielberg effects, this movie lends itself to all the latest resolution, color, and sound equipment of the day and will probably adapt to future presentation features. Many people are more fascinated with the movie's sound, resolution, and color than the story or acting, or message.I saw the streaming 4K version, so I am more fascinated with the extra information on the screen that tells a lot of the background of the making of the movie and how it fared in various countries. We find out where the concept of the story originated. We learn that the main town is fictitious but based on many other towns. We also get the filming locations and interest in the color filtering of the movie for artistic purposes.The basic story is that there are four brothers (Ryan) that go to war and three are killed. After reading a letter from President Abraham Lincoln on the same situation in the American Civil War it is decided that the fourth brother needs to be found and sent home. So, the over theme is about doing just that. However, in the process, we are given a lot to think about as each soldier on the mission grows with each step they take. Will they find Private Ryan and if so, what then?You can see Spielberg's hand in this and among the great actors is Tom Hanks giving a stellar performance.

Still-Powerful Effects and Performances Leave Us Knee-Deep in the Great War,"Gripping, horrific first-person experiences in the thick of World War II, as you're already, no doubt, keenly aware. It's held up exceptionally well over time, most likely due to the great lengths taken by Spielberg and company to stamp it down in a specific era and remain steadfastly historical. The Normandy beach landing that opens the action is still as powerful and haunting as ever, an effects showcase like none other that puts us right down in the middle of hell itself. I couldn't help but pontificate about the futility of ground warfare here, faced with row after row of doe-eyed teenagers, unceremoniously mowed down before taking so much as a single step on enemy territory. Which is part of its message, no doubt - though that's somewhat countered by the tales of bravado, camaraderie and character that sprawl out over the next two hours. A richly rounded war story, it enjoys a mess of acting performances even stronger than the work of the effects team. Tom Hanks is at the top of the mountain as Captain Miller, a demanding role that he owns from moment one. Supporting faces pop out of the woodwork at every corner; most of us remember Vin Diesel and Adam Goldberg in early roles, but quick shots from Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Bryan Cranston and more left my jaw agape. How did I miss spotting these guys the last time? A true epic, profound and moving, with plenty of action but just as much character-building and adventure also in the mix.

"Absolutely among the greatest war films ever made, with just a few unforgivable mistakes.","As a die-hard Steven Spielberg fan, I find it difficult to give such a tremendously powerful film like Saving Private Ryan anything less than a 10, but there were a couple of things in the film that caused huge problems for me, mainly because they could have been avoided so easily. For example, whose brilliant idea was it to cast a teenage heartthrob like Matt Damon (and yes, I realize that he is not a teen himself, but he is extremely popular among junior high school girls) in the role of a private in a World War II film?! Tom Hanks was perfect, but only because he is one of the best actors working right now, and he can do a great job in virtually any role. Furthermore, Ted Danson literally stops the film in its tracks.However, Saving Private Ryan, despite these superficial problems, is a truly timeless film, and is an extremely powerful depiction of the brutality of World War II.

Brilliant war epic,"Five years after ""Schindler's List"", director Steven Spielberg delivered another powerful motion picture drama, ""Saving Private Ryan"". This movie (set during WWII) tells the story of a group of soldiers (led by Army captain Tom Hanks) who go into France to find a private who's three brothers were killed in action, and send him home. The opening 30 minute D-Day sequence is one of the most harrowing movie scenes ever filmed. The story is exceptional, the directing is brilliant, and the acting is excellent. Tom Hanks is terrific as usual, and is supported by an outstanding cast which includes Matt Damon (""Good Will Hunting""), Tom Sizemore (""Black Hawk Down""), Edward Burns (""She's the One""), Vin Diesel (""The Fast and the Furious""), Adam Goldberg (""A Beautiful Mind""), Jeremy Davies (""Twister""), Barry Pepper (""61*""), Giovanni Ribisi (""subUrbia""), and Ryan Hurst (""Remember the Titans""). Some of these actors have gone on to bigger things since this movie but they're all good here. Popular TV star Ted Danson (TV's ""Cheers"" and ""Becker"") and veteran character actor Dennis Farina (""Midnight Run"" and ""Get Shorty"") even turn up in cameos. ""Saving Private Ryan"" should have won the Best Picture Oscar for 1998 because it's a war movie that's harrowing and powerful. It did go on to win 5 Oscars including Spielberg's Best Director win.

Very Overrated,"Yes, ""Saving Private Ryan"" has very graphic action scenes which are more realistic than the average war movie, but there are other aspects in which it fails in being authentic: the attitudes, behaviors and values of the people in the time period which the movie depicts. In particular, some of the major and minor characters of ""S.P.R."" exhibit very self-absorbed characteristics which would have been very uncommon among regular troops during World War II. Sure, people have some of the same feelings and other characteristics throughout history, and soldiers frequently grumble and are cynical, but the people shown in this movie tend to reflect much more what 1990's guys were like rather than 1940's men. For a war movie which does a better job of showing 1940's troops, try ""Battleground.""Like many others here, I like war movies to be authentic in depicting things like uniforms, equipment and tactics, and ""S.P.R."" is successful in some of this, but to me it is more important for a movie to be accurate in depicting character, attitude and the actual events that occurred, and in this ""S.P.R"" is very lacking. It does a better job of demonstrating Spielberg's 1990's limousine-liberal biases. This is especially seen in the character depictions. Another kind of example which is comparatively minor is how the German troops' haircuts in ""S.P.R."" tend to look more like those of late-20th Century skinheads than what German SS and Wehrmacht troops usually wore.Also, I think that the reviewer James Bowman makes a good point about movies such as ""S.P.R."" and ""Flags of Our Fathers:"" ""...perhaps showing too much respect for the suffering is not to show enough respect for the man. For if we suppose, as some of us still do, that these men suffered for something  to wit, their duty, their honor, their country  don't these thing deserve just a little bit of respect as well?...""To get an idea of what the Normandy Campaign was like, you would be much better off reading non-fiction accounts of it, and listening to comments by actual men who were there. It takes much more than gushing blood, flying body parts and the message ""War is hell"" to constitute a great war film. If you want to see cinematic movies which do a better job than ""S.P.R."" of depicting some of the general look and feel of war, and the characters and attitudes of people of the World War II period, try ""Talvisota"" and ""Der Untergang."" Also, ""A Bridge Too Far"" is very good, especially for a blockbuster-type movie. ""A Bridge Too Far"" has a few very minor inaccuracies, some composite characters and some simplifications of the real events, but it does an excellent job of showing the characters of troops and civilians, and it is mostly factual. ""The Longest Day,"" while it includes some Hollywood flourishes, also is very good. It doesn't have the special effects and combat realism of ""S.P.R.,"" but it is almost completely based on facts, which counts for a lot with me, and for which I rank it much higher than ""S.P.R."" ""The Longest Day"" also has one of the most impressive large-scale depictions of combat in any movie, showing the storming of a German position by a Free French unit.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Instead you have some lame Shakespeare in Love get that honor that no one in this century even remembers. You don't see SiL getting re-played on cable all the time like SPR does. You don't have a great half hour opening scene like in SPR with the Normandy scene which is one of the best scenes in motion picture history.Spielberg and Hanks with this and then followed up with the miniseries Band of Brothers and The Pacific basically reinvented what a depiction of war should look like on film.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Replaced the british waterduck operators with americans.,"One of the most crucial things to get right is war movies or documentaries, if you get it wrong and forget soldiers that died in that war then that's what people will interpret when they see the movie if they don't know any better and that erase the memories of the soldiers that died in that war.Saving Private Ryan did exactly that and sadly it's not an accident either, they meant to replace those british waterduck operators with american ones and it isn't exactly the first time they try to reap all the glory through movies.After such a tragic and selfish decision i can not give the movie more than a 8, it's not a realistic war movie if it thinks its acceptable to forget soldiers that died for their country, it's criminal.I'm not british but had i been i probably would have sued for twisting the truth to their own favour.

Saving Private Ryan!,"Matt Damon one of my favorite actor! The epic scale and action set pieces alone make this film 5 stars. The brutality and emotional toll of war is captured well in the settings and acting, especially the opening 20 minutes.

War is hell,"In the late-90s there were two particular films that redefined their particular genres. Saving Private Ryan was one of them (the other, unfortunately, was The Matrix). Almost every war movie that followed SPR, right down to 2008's Rambo, seemed to be no more than a pastiche of Spielberg's hectic style.SPR proves what an inconsistent filmmaker Spielberg can be. The man has had his fair share of misfires (Hook, anyone?) but this was his last truly great effort. War of the Worlds and Munich were good, though hardly as revolutionary, but The Terminal, Catch Me If You Can, and the movie that called itself Indy IV were all just too gutless and inoffensive. You'd never believe they were from the same director if you didn't know better.A lot of critics have repeatedly praised SPR over the years, but they all praise the same things (the documentary style, the realism, etc.) Simultaneously, a lot of people have dismissed it as shallow, badly-written, and void of any thrills beyond the 30-minute mark. But look beneath the surface and you'll find that SPR does actually have a tight screenplay, despite going through the motions on few occasions. The wide and diverse cast (including Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Dennis Farina, and Dale Dye) do good with the material. It's refreshing for a war movie to move beyond the 'point of view of one man' cliché.Janusz Kaminski's desaturated, gritty, high-shutter-speed photography is full of deep blacks and high contrast. This look has been imitated to death over the years, but coupled with Spielberg's hurried, almost unscripted approach to the action it adds an element of authenticity to the film that the copycats have not been able to emulate.You really have to feel for all those poor soldiers who were massacred on Omaha Beach (all men, I should point out). But what a badly planned mission. No flack jackets, no smoke screens to cover their landing...warfare has come so far in 65 years, it would be insane to send so many hundreds off to die like that now. Many of them were pure cannon fodder and the Military knew it. The film certainly does not hold back on the bloody carnage. Most WWII movies up until that point were sanitized and bloodless. Hardly realistic at all!The 169 minute running time passes fairly quickly. The film certainly doesn't deserve the criticism that nothing interesting happens after the beach invasion. As it has been imitated many times since, some of then innovative moments (such as the silent 'war is hell' amid battle chaos - which this film does three times!) have become clichés, but don't judge SPR for it.The film won 5 Oscars, but lost the Best Picture award to Shakespeare in Love, which is absolutely insane. I mean...what were they thinking??? SPR is most certainly a classic, and one of the most innovative and important war films of the past two decades, while Shakespeare in Love is largely forgotten.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the Greatest War Films of Its or Any Other Time,"Within the opening 30 minutes into Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg simply rewrote everything there ever was about warfare filmmaking, destroyed many Hollywood clichés in the process, completely redefined the combat genre & permanently cemented this film's place amongst the greatest examples of war cinema.The movie opens with the devastating but successful invasion of Normandy by Allied powers during the Second World War & the main plot surfaces after that. It concerns a band of soldiers who are assigned a new mission to go behind enemy lines in order to retrieve a missing soldier whose all brothers have been killed in action.Steven Spielberg's direction this time challenges & breaks every barrier of action filmmaking as this film is his all out assault on the film audience' psyche & takes them right into the battlefield with all the blood, bullets & limbs flying around. Add to that, the camera-work with its desaturated colour & point of view shooting gives the plot a heightened sense of realism too.Just like any other Spielberg's movie, Saving Private Ryan is pretty much fine tuned in its technical departments as the editing, visual effects, sound & everything is top-notch although John Williams' score doesn't have much to contribute to the whole film. The performances by its ensemble cast are also very good with Hanks impressing the most with his swashbuckling performance.Yet, in spite of all the praise & it putting up perhaps the most harrowing depiction of war on- screen, it isn't a flawless work & comes with its share of disappointments. The biggest drawback about Saving Private Ryan is that after its unforgettable opening sequence, the film is never able to reach the same height for the entirety of its runtime & even drags in the middle of its story only to rise again in the end.Another major problem I have with it is the film's relentless emphasis on glorifying America since some real-life events depicted here completely ignore the aid US received from other allies during the D-Day landings plus the extremely biased manner in which it portrays the German soldiers is absolutely insulting. It's specifically made for American audience & doesn't have a universal appeal like many other films of its genre.On an overall scale, Saving Private Ryan presents its esteemed director at his brutal best and with its unflinching take on the horrors of war delivers an extremely intense, powerfully moving, brutally realistic & truly unforgettable cinematic experience. It may not be the greatest war film ever made but its contribution to warfare filmmaking has been immense. And for that alone, it will forever be remembered as one of its genre's finest works.",,Anonymous,Drama

An impressive story,"Saving Private Ryan is an impressive war movie that does a great job at portraying the bitter sweet line of events in WorldWar2. Not just because of the story itself but also on behave of the director. They did a great job at using the music, colour, camera angels and motions to portray the complex emotions and chaos. In this story it comes forward that war isn't a heroic thing to enjoy and laugh about. It effects everyone in another way. You can see that in the characters they brought forward in this story, you see that there's no such thing as evil and good, it's only chaos. The story focuses on how people react and act in war without leaving important details about the it. The movie keeps it personal. They did an absolutely great job at showing ( and not telling ) the story in realistically feeling way. Despite the durance of the movie it didn't feel like to much information or time.

The battle scenes are chaotic and intense, with the sound design effectively adding to the overall sense of huge chaos and danger. The film's score, by the legendary John Williams, is also of great note and effectively adds to the film's emotional impact.The acting is also superb, with Tom Hanks in particular delivering a standout performance as Captain John Miller. The supporting cast, which includes veteran actors such as Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, and Barry Pepper, is also excellent and really helps to flesh out the film's ensemble of characters.This is one of the films that really helped to solidify Spielberg as one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation in my eyes. The film's realistic and intense depiction of combat has made it a war movie fans like myself.Overall then, Saving Private Ryan is undoubtedly a powerful and intense war film that is sure to captivate with its stunning cinematography, excellent performances, and emotionally impactful storyline.

This film is a perfect resemblance of what war is. Not the flashy heroic way that some films and modern video games depict it. Onto the film, it is truly spectacular. The cinematography and lighting, sound effects and acting are all brilliant. I'm extremely shocked and furious that this film didn't win Best Picture and Shakespeare in Love did. Tom Hanks is astounding in this film along with a fairly new Matt Damon as Private Ryan. The whole cast (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns ect ) are all really really good. I admit that the film does contain bloody moments but such is needed to depict the emotional and mental impact that this movie has.Overall, this is one hundred percent 10/10 and a much deserved Best Director for my favourite Steven Speilburg who always puts in the best quality for all of his films.If you liked this film I would recommend other war films like Fury with Brad Pitt or if you don't fancy the blood and guts then Dunkirk is just as good.Another with a more darker tone and I wouldn't exactly class as a ""war"" film is Schindlers list which is also by Steven Speilburg.

Tripe,"I think this film is terrible.  The war scenes are gimmicky, especially the flanging, shakey camera work.  Some scenes are outrageously unrealistic, such as when those American soldiers shot the Germans using the mirror. Also, studies have been done showing that only about 1/3 of American troops landing during D-Day fired their rifles.  Not all of these soldiers were hardcore killers like the movie makes them out to be.  It's laughable that people call this film ""realistic.""The audience is given very little credit.  The dialogue sounds like it is cut out of newspaper articles which editorialize the mission.  It's as though Spielberg thought his audience was so stupid that the moral dilemma of the film had to be spelled out for them in detail.It also overused action sequences.  Those in creative control of the film tried to make up for the lack of depth with gritty, excessive scenes of violence.  All in all, this is one of the worst films that I have ever seen.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Nothing but American rubbish..,"Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg's continued descent into narrow, arrogant, low-brow revisionism, is at best a languid patriotic trump-calling movie with nothing better to do than applaud the ""glorious, morally superior American armed forces"", who were in actuality nothing but teenage thugs who beat German prisoners and raped French women and looted European cities. He starts off with Kleenex totting bravery and then leads us into brutal images that have no other point than to entertain the violent video game minded geeks of American malls, he then regresses into heavy handed sentimentality that leads the viewer to conclude that Americans were all ""good guys"". This is not the case, history has shown us so. Americans, for all their good intentions in World War 2, were just as loathsome as the Nazis, they had a deep segregationist attitude in the States which killed people because of skin color, arrested and imprisoned innocent, hard working Japanese people and locked them in concentration camps, kept black soldiers in separate units which often were the lowliest positions, fire bombed non-tactical European cities, most notably Dresden, hired former Nazis to combat the communist threat and finally, dropped two atomic bombs upon an innocent Japanese civilian population. And after the war, things got even worse, the ""Red Hunt"", which resembled the trials in Nazi Germany in the 1930's occurred under a madman named McCarthy. So if you want to be blindly led by Spielberg's glorious war message that is simply propaganda, then by all means do and watch this film which has no redeeming qualities.",,Anonymous,Drama

Spielberg Directs Your Eye,"I've seen this movie, probably, a half dozen times or so. I'm a fan of the HBO series ""Band of Brothers"" which Tom Hanks and Spielberg were both Producers on, so, already knowing the story and setting fairly well, I figured I would put this on and get some emails done, balance my accounts, and maybe do some drawing.That did not happen. Even the opening sequence which takes place in modern day as an old man walks through fields of graves, marked with white crosses and stars of David, drew me in, and before I knew it we were halfway up the beach, the French countryside, and eventually defending the bridge.Try as I did to get other things done, there is something about the way Spielberg directs that captures the attention and eye of the viewer.I love a good WW2 movie, but when Spielberg makes one, it makes every other one I've seen feel like a staged reenactment or kids playing war in the back lot of the neighborhood.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the most beautifully crafted and scripted war movies to date,"One of the hardest tasks in life is dealing with the death of someone close. For some, even losing just one loved one could be impossible to handle. Unfortunately, WWII propelled very young men directly into the heart of stressful and gruesome violence, defining the survivors as some of the most emotionally hardened people to walk this earth.Saving Private Ryan delves directly into the story of a young man, Private Ryan, who because of the rules regarding death of family members in war, needs to be found and taken out of combat. Opening with an older Ryan, as he grieves the loss of a fellow soldier, instantly defining strong emotion and foreshadowing the tone of the movie. The scene quickly changes, however, throwing the viewer directly into heart-pounding action as an extremely historic and defining battle takes place, D-Day. Stress, anxiety and extreme suspense come over the viewer as bullets, explosions, and life-threatening events overcome Ryan. The movie is no stranger to strong emotion, as it quickly shows death, destruction, and gripping violence that is familiar with the soldiers on the field. The main character, Ryan, is not portrayed to be some valiant war hero either, but rather more vulnerable, and life-like. Ryan is a character people can relate to, feel for, and become much more connected to, making it much easier for the emotions to be shared between him and the viewer.Throughout Saving Private Ryan, an overall sense of urgency and looming danger is felt. Whether it be directly in the middle of heart-pounding action and excitement, defined by loud explosions, blood-curdling screams, and sounds of bullets whizzing by. Or where suspense is heavy, in the most quiet of times, where silence seems all too bliss. Visual demonstrations of intense action and perfect recreations of life-like scenes help the viewer become immersed in what is happening, almost smelling the fires burning and the gasoline filling the air.The movie does an excellent job at creating realistic and accurate scenes. Since the movie is based on a historic event, it's crucial that everything that happens needs to replicate the time that it was set in perfectly, or massive reductions in the immersive nature of the movie would be felt, and many parts would feel dull and unrealistic. However, the attention to detail is shown, as everything from the vehicles, to the technology, even down to the way people talk, using slang terms and real conversations that people in the 1940's might have, is spot on. Saving Private Ryan is an amazing, immersive and jaw-dropping movie that easily has the potential to be regarded as one of the greats for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Overated,"I remember when the hype when SPR was first released: "" Gawd it`s so realistic , it shows the true face of war , it`s like being there man"" I also remember that these claims were made by civilians with no experience of the military or combat ( Maybe the next time a film audience wants to experience the horrors of war, the cinema might like to stick a sniper behind the screen to pick off sundry filmgoers. That would be realistic ) To this day I haven`t heard a single D-Day survivor comment on the realism of this film.Yes I agree that the opening 20 minutes of SPR are outstanding as is the final battle at the end but the outstanding visuals fail to disguise the very average script that is no different from a John Wayne or Errol Flynn star vehicle. There`s very little depth to the story which seems at odds with the anti war visuals.I will defend the film slightly from the allegation of pro American bias. It`s an American film , made by Americans , with American money for a primarily American public. For a more subjective view on the Normandy landings see THE LONGEST DAY , or better still read the book. But the comment on Monty was uncalled for , Bernard Law Montgomery spent 4 years on the western front ( 1914-18 ) he was disgusted by the slaughter he saw there and made needless casualties his main concern. I bet the red army wished for a general like that on the Eastern front. Oh and Monty won the battle of El Alamein , thought I`d just mention it.So just to sum up SPR has some graphic battle scenes overcoming a flawed script. It`s a good film but nowhere near being a masterpiece. Maybe if it`d been set during the Korean war and been a lot more cynical it`d might have been a true classic. But as it is it`s a case of a B movie script saved by a brilliant director",4.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Spielberg constructs this cruel atmosphere, which makes use of viscerally to make it clear that war is not about heroism and bravery, it is about chaos, terror and violence","The Second World War has already been represented in several films, but Saving Private Ryan has one of the most realistic and agonizing sequences that cinema has ever made. In its first 30 minutes, the film portrays the Normandy landings, more precisely on Omaha beach in June 1944. We follow Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) as he and his companions arrive on the continent surprised by the attack of Nazi rivals. We don't know the characters, we don't even know their names yet, but we soon care. We are coldly shown the situation they are going through; we see the bodies falling shot, soldiers crying, begging for their mothers, their homes, and the captain trying to deal with that situation while asking for his help.The graphic power of these opening scenes is translated into the impeccable sound work that bet on the diegetic sounds, the shots, screams and supplications of the combatants. After the opening shots, the pace of the film calms down a bit. Now with the situation already under control and the battle over, the captain (Tom Hanks) along with his group receive a mission, to find the soldier James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), youngest of 4 brothers where 3 died in combat, and guarantee his return home. The captain then follows, accompanied by seven men for the mission. Now they find themselves on a journey facing the enemy and some allies in search of the soldier. We watched the dramas of those men, their fears, their doubts about the mission, after all, ""why risk the lives of eight men to save one?""... The captain's determination is what moves the group, his quest to complete the mission and at the same time protecting the soldiers, even in times of disagreement or loss, is what guarantees the unity of the team. Until finally we reach the final confrontation with the Nazis, as grand as the beginning.In ""Saving Private Ryan"", Steven Spielberg does not try to create a story of heroism or anything like that, he seeks to highlight the horrors of war, how monstrous human beings become in the midst of such terrible situations and how much each one fights to keep what's left of his humanity, to endure the endless trials in order to finally be able to return home. We can see this clearly already in the long second sequence of the film, which depicts the landing in Normandy, with the Allied forces being shot by the Nazis in their fortified positions. Such a scene already clearly defines how visceral this Spielberg work is, which does not spare the viewer at any time, using violence as a central element to shock and, of course, immerse us in this merciless plot. Following the example of what he himself had done in the aforementioned Schindler's List, the director chose not to use storyboards in this emblematic sequence, thus creating an extremely natural portrait, a recreation so impressive that, in order to work, it needed the situations guided the camera and not the other way around.Dispensing with this idealization, we clearly see the fragility of all the characters there, whether soldiers, sergeants, captains. Upon receiving the mission to rescue James Ryan, the last of four brothers, all killed in combat, the members of Captain John Miller's (Tom Hanks) squadron do not hesitate to question such orders. ""What makes him better than us? We also have mothers"" - ask the soldiers, who are answered with a simple ""those are our orders"". The choice of word is essential here, it is constantly spoken of in orders and not in duty - morality is not in question, but the military hierarchy - they carry out the mission out of obligation and not because they are just, good men, concerned with the shattering of the American dream of that lady who lost her children. There is no romanticism here, just raw reality, which, little by little, makes us identify with the characters and their reservations in relation to this task. It doesn't take long before we feel a certain dislike for Ryan and all that it took to rescue him.This does not mean that they are, in fact, bad people or anything like that, they are simply people, like any other. Robert Rodat's text does not hide the personality of these soldiers behind ranks or military protocol, quite the contrary, the more time we spend alongside this squadron, we see that there are salespeople, mechanics, teachers, all in uniform in the hope that one day they will be able to see their families again. The objective is to win the war, says Miller at one point, showing that words like ""end tyranny"", ""return justice to the world"" are reserved for politicians and the like, those who try to sell the reason for entering the war (not that it was optional for the US, considering the fuse, Pearl Harbor) and of course motivate the thousands of young people who risk their lives there in foreign lands.Tom Hanks commands the action and transforms his Captain John Miller into a very believable figure. Without giving too many details of his past, the reluctant war hero has only one idea in mind: find that soldier Ryan and get him to safety so he can return home and be reunited with his wife. Stressed by the effects of war, Miller tries in every way to keep his platoon together, even if he doesn't fully believe in the mission he's following. He is the sane figure, who guides the group. But this balance is not permanent, since the loss of one of his soldiers almost throws him into an abyss. In his first partnership with Spielberg, Hanks proves to be a perfect actor for the role, as he uses his persona as an ordinary man in an extraordinary situation to the full benefit of the film. In one of his first high-profile roles after Good Will Hunting (1997), Matt Damon proves to be an interesting actor as he touches on the pain of a man who lost all three of his brothers in the conflict and who, as a result, receives a return ticket. To the house. He is reluctant to return and does not intend to do so by letting his teammates down. A good performance, albeit notably from a green actor, but on the rise. Edward Burns, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper and Giovanni Ribisi are outstanding names in a practically infallible cast.Although it is very remembered for the first 25 minutes of non-stop action, showing in a raw and violent way the invasion of Normandy by the Allied troops, Saving Private Ryan manages to go further. With an almost episodic plot, it gradually reveals the anguish of war and the men who fight in it. There are several points to highlight. The sequence in which a battered Caparzo (before fame Vin Diesel) tries to save a child in a house in ruins demonstrates the soldier's emotional imbalance - ""she reminded me of my niece"" - as well as the despair of the population that was in the center of combat, who would rather see their young daughter in the hands of an unknown soldier than with them. Or the drama of unprepared men who are sent into combat and find themselves completely frozen in moments of stress - Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) being the best example. And what is right or wrong when an enemy is in your hands and you can choose between killing him or letting him go, knowing that this same person may turn against you or your companions in the near future? Spielberg is very happy to fill his feature film with moments like this, which make the viewer put himself in the shoes of those characters.If the thoughtful moments are interesting, the action moments are even better. The aforementioned opening sequence is a great example of how to film a conflict correctly. Spielberg knows how to tell his stories on camera, and although the scenes are fast and bombastic, the audience is never lost. There is great control of the mise-en-scene by the director, who manages to put us in the middle of that conflict and try to sensorially emulate what those characters are feeling. When Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) tries to reach the shore on D-Day, all hell breaks loose. Close explosions take him out of the moment and we see, with a shaky camera and the different sound design, how that character is facing that moment. Saving Private Ryan is a true lesson in how to build action scenes that are far from the ""blink-lost"" so used by low-caliber filmmakers. Each and every misdirection used by Spielberg is thought to have such an effect. And this is something salutary in his filmography. Less cited, but equally potent, is the final sequence, the stand against German forces at Ramelle. Not only are the moments of action well executed, but the plans and strategies used there draw attention to detail.Spielberg creates a war epic like few directors could, making a perfect blend between the viscerally of the battles, immersed in horror, with the human drama of the soldiers. Within this proposal, the first half hour of the production is dedicated to the landing on Omaha beach, where the filmmaker immerses the viewer in the terrifying experience that is war. Still on the technical side, it is necessary to mention the Oscar-winning cinematography of Janusz Kaminski (The Post), which emphasizes the gray tones in the image and, sometimes, ""bursts"" the white of the sky, almost making it seem that the characters are inside a nightmare.""Saving Private Ryan"" is not just any movie about war, it is a work that transports us into it, makes us suffer and vibrate alongside this group of soldiers who received the most unexpected mission. Even with a hesitant narrative at times, Steven Spielberg hits the mark in the tone and construction of this cruel atmosphere, which makes use of viscerally to make it clear that war is not about heroism and bravery, it is about chaos, terror and violence, elements that were fought by that distant hope of soldiers finally being able to return to their homes.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

They can't honestly say that this is how they thought WWII was, can they?? All Americans and not a Brit, Frenchman or anyone of another nationality in sight.This movie was made for an American crowd and to make money at the box office.

"I only have a few things to say about this famous, mostly great war movie","I'll keep this review brief because Saving Private Ryan has been discussed to near death, and there's little new or interesting one can say about it. It's over 20 years old, and for as long as I can remember, it's always been held up as one of the greatest war movies of all time. The first time I watched it, back in about 2011, I wasn't super enthusiastic about it. I thought it was excellently made, but overlong, a little sappy as far as the ending was concerned, and bothered by it seeming to show both the horrors of war and the heroics.With that last point, I still feel it does this to some extent. Most of the time, it makes war look pretty horrible, most famously in that opening sequence (as a note: the rest of the film suffers a bit in general coming after that scene. And as great as it is, it doesn't have a huge impact on the rest of the story; we get an introduction to some characters, and a sense of Hanks' character being a good leader, but such things could technically be conveyed in a more succinct manner, so the scene does feel a little tacked on to the rest of the film. Still, what a scene though). But then the other big action sequence near the film's climax is kind of too entertaining. There are moments of grit and horror within it, but not as frequently as the opening sequence. It's not as disorientating or stomach-churning. War doesn't look fun exactly, but now war looks heroic.I can't say for sure, but sticking to one side of this might have been better for the film as a whole, rather than sitting on the fence and saying war can be heroic while also being horrifying. Maybe it's that the connection to the characters is somewhat lacking, because while I did mostly want them to succeed, I wasn't hugely attached to them in an emotional way. I prefer Gallipoli and the recent 1917 because I cared for the characters more. I respected them as individuals put into a horrible situation, while also getting the sense that the films they were in were putting forth a strong anti-war sentiment.Saving Private Ryan is anti-war, but not in as strong a manner as it could be. The second large battle scene should be as horrifying as the first battle scene to argue this in a stronger way, or otherwise, action should be avoided (look at the infamous Come And See for a go-to example of how to do an absolutely terrifying war film). But those critiques aside, there's little else to fault here, particularly on a technical front. Spielberg does an incredible job directing, and the cast is overall solid. The music was a little disappointing I guess, considering it's John Williams, but then again, the lack of music does help make that opening scene all the more effective.It's a mostly great film, and I liked it a lot more on my recent rewatch, compared to 2011. There are still a few little things here and there that bothered me, and kept me from counting this among my favourite war films. But there is also so much that's done well that I can't help but be in awe of most of what ended up on screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

The legendary war film,"Saving private Ryan is one of the few experience that opened my eyes on the ugliness of the war I never imagined it like that how the humans can be bloodthirsty like that how humans are the main reason for the corruption how it's hard to be a soldier physically ,mentally and emotionally
I'm happy I wasn't born back thenStory
Is kinda wired and doesn't make sense even the main characters objected on the mission but we'll understand what that means for the war itself the movie reflects the main reason for the war how precious the life isCharacters
The characters are very realistic the dialogue is the main engine to build and develop our characters everyone here have his persona that affects his decisions through the journey and I loved and hated (upham) in the way how the humans beliefs vanish in wars there are few moments in your life if you didn't do the right thing you're gonna regret the film reflects that perfectlyActing
Everyone here deserves an Oscar nomination the actors blended in Thier characters and they succeeded at reflecting the horrors of war for half of them this is the greatest performances for me those are my favorites
Tom Hanks in captain Miller
Jeremy Davies in upham
Giovanni Ribisi in Wade

Steven Spielberg won an Oscar for that movie and it's really deserved as I mentioned before the filming is great the 2nd scene is the longest scene I've ever seen in my whole life and the most effective he also cared for characters and lightened them with the greatest war scenes are I knew later that video games like call of duty had built Thier gameplay on that movie as a main reference so the movie affected the entertainment industry and for the first time I love the shakey camera in movies because it's clear and reflected the soldiers emotions and the war in general and in some scenes there's no soundtracks only guns sounds that was super awesome and horrible at the same time.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The Sacrifices of War,"Like so many of his generation, Steven Spielberg's father served in World War II. Therefore, the director had spent countless hours listening to Daddy describing his war-time experiences. Many years later, when Spielberg received a script about the battles on Omaha Beach in 1944, he therefore became enthusiastic. Making a film about the fight against the Nazis seemed a good way to pay tribute to Dad.The movie takes place on D-day, during the Allied invasion of Normandy towards the end of the war. It follows eight young American soldiers, struggling to find a certain Private Ryan behind enemy lines. And bring him back to the United States. Alive!Steven Spielberg hired a retired marine captain to prepare the actors for the grueling shoot. His ""boot camp"" lasted six days, with extremely tough military exercises. There was intensive weapons training, close combat drills and endless, individual maneuvers. The only thing the guys got to eat were K-rations of the same type that was used on the battlefields during the Second World War.Despite all the controversy regarding the amount of brutality portrayed, the film became a worldwide hit. It ultimately grossed over $500 million at the global box office. The movie also inspired a lively media debate about the increasing violence in popular culture. After winning a number of prestigious international awards, ""Saving Private Ryan"" collected eleven Academy Award nominations.Surprisingly, ""Saving Private Ryan"" lost to ""Shakespeare in Love"" for the best picture Oscar. Something that was considered one of the great controversies in the history of the Academy Awards. However, Steven Spielberg didn't go home empty-handed. For the second time in a few years, he won a best director Oscar. And, as in the case of ""Schindler's List"", it was for a film set during World War ll.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Best war story since The Best Years Of Our Lives,"I find it hard to compare war movie of different wars. All Quiet On The Western Front, Full Metal Jacket, and Platoon are some of my favorites. Glory an Braveheart are also extremely good. Saying this is the best war movie ever is tough. Apocalypse Now, FMJ, and Platoon are all great movies but don't have as great a plot or anything approaching the cinematography of this movie. The cinematography of the opening battle scene is by far the greatest 15 minutes in the history of film technique. It has to be experienced on a theater screen and up close to get the full feeling of the sheer insanity that takes place in the midst of a battle. The story that follows the super impressive opening is no less genius. It's a great Dr Strangelove feel of conflicting morals, interests, and sanity. Tom Hanks,Tom Sizemore do wonderful acting jobs and I'm not quite sure who plays the sniper but he steals the movie from everyone. Great writing and attention to detail including actual Panzer tank sounds rack up more points for this movie. The violence much like any real war has quite a humbling effect. And the backdrop of D-Day (often called the greatest battle in history) provides the perfect opportunity to show how horrible death really is.

Fantasy reigns supreme,"Spielberg just about had it here, at least for the first half hour or so. He looked at the bone-crunching, grisly history of D-day and had the movie to put it on the screen with some respect for honest reality. Then, with his Hollywood sellout lack of vision, Spielberg decided to throw it all away on patriotic fantasy. The 'true' story the film may be based on has some chaplain in France discovering Ryan after word was passed along that his brothers had all been lost and the lad should be shipped back to America so his mother still has one child to work the farm. Or, the story could be straight out of the writer's head but it hardly matters. The premise itself strikes the viewer as utterly ludicrous after a half-hour of complete slaughter, the seas red with human blood and gore. We are expected to believe that an army chief is sitting in his office and worrying over Private Ryan and his family while the assault on Normandy is costing thousands upon thousands of lives, while the allied bombers are missing their mark up and down the coast and Hitler's machine guns are just mowing down allies like grass. What romantic rubbish and so typical of Hollywood. And the portrayal of the German prisoner is morally offensive. The German people have never been less human than Americans, even when they were lead by an evil leader into a war.  To portray them as Spielberg does the prisoner, a bumbling idiot who later becomes a murdering snake, hissing shhh as he slowly sinks a huge knife into an American chest, is low-brow, hateful stuff. But nobody is going to notice. Believe me. In fact, we love to see the world in black and white, simplistic terms.  Here come the Oscars for Spielberg. Americans (and my own Canadians too) are generally not prepared to see the truth about themselves. Capital 'D' Denial reigns supreme, especially at the box-office. Spielberg's big budget is spent to further anesthetize us while claiming to be trying to do justice to the truth. If he'd stayed on the beach at Omaha, he'd have a nine out of ten. Instead, he rates several points less for this updated version of that old T.V. series called Combat. Please see Amy Taubin's review at the following URL.

One of the best films of the year,"The opening 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan are some of the most brutal images put on screen. I don't care what you've seen before, this is absolutely shocking. There were times when it was difficult to watch these events flash in front of my eyes. War is not pretty, and Speilberg shows you this in a way that will grab you, a man holding his intestines is crying for his mother, another man who loses an arm confusingly tries to pick it up with his other hand. You know that this is not gonna be a pretty ride.Saving Private Ryan is Speilberg's follow up to last year's highly underrated film, Amistad. Tom Hanks is Captain Miller, who gets word of Private Ryan (Matt Damon), who lost all of his brothers in the war (he still doesn't know it yet), Private Ryan is therefore granted a safe trip back home, and it's up to Captain Miller and seven others to make sure that he makes his return home as soon as possible. The only problem is that they don't know exactly where he is, just somewhere behind enemy lines. The eight begin their journey and on their way each of their characters are revealed, we find out that Captain Miller, as tough as he is, wants nothing more than to get out of the violence and tragedy that he has to deal with everyday. He just wants to return home, as does almost everybody else.Speilberg is in top form again, and although it's not as perfect as his masterpiece, Schindler's List, it does rank as the best film of 1998 (so far). The performances are top-notch and incredibly real, especially Tom Hanks' character.So what can you say? Speilberg has done it again. Never before has war been shown so realistically before. If there is one film that can show the atrocities that soldiers had to go through every day, SPR is the one. Is it the best war film ever made?... I don't think so.

Underwhelming,"Not Steven Spielberg's best film by a long shot (ET or Schindler's List anyone?) but certainly his most graphic, Saving Private Ryan is pretty much summed up by its tagline ""The Mission is a Man"". The film is simple, almost to the point of frustration and possibly Spielberg wanted it this way to highlight some of the themes running throughout the film (war is, um... bad). However what it amounts to is poor storytelling. Coming from Spielberg, a man who prides himself for storytelling, this is a disappointment.Tom Hanks plays the everyman, again, as a reluctant schoolteacher wanting to help his country. Matt Damon plays Private Ryan, the young soldier that Hanks and his crew have been sent to find. Beginning with one of the most memorable scenes in recent cinema and ending with one of the most sickeningly sentimental scenes, Private Ryan is an uneven work. What people like about this film is the simple message juxtaposed with, what I guess, brutal violence. Oliver Stone managed this better in Platoon (even the brilliant opening scene in Private Ryan does not compare to the scene in Platoon where the soldiers burn down the Vietnamese village).That said, SVP still features decent performances from Matt Damon and Tom Hanks with excellent support coming from Tom Sizemore and a surprisingly touching performance from Vin Diesel, in a small role as an Italian-American soldier. The direction is also solid as is the script. However mundanity and Spielberg's safety net, sentimentality frequently come into play making this a lesser entry in the war film and the Spielberg cannon.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Dirty Dozen for the 90s,"There was a time when Spielberg felt the film-making fraternity had overlooked him. Those days may be over, but the reasons why it happened, sadly, are not. The lesson seems to be, make a film about the holocaust and be magically transformed into a critical heavyweight.The sad fact is that Schindler's List is (in my opinion) a very good film, but not a great one  it is too heavy handed. I am in a minority. Likewise, bolt on 20 minutes of startling cinematography (which was not part of the original Spielberg grand plan) and transform a fairly pedestrian, unoriginal war-is-naughty-but-devilishly-exciting flick into a major cinematic event.Can someone who loves this film as Art (I choose capitals for its ironic effect) explain how it was that the film managed to spawn a whole series of computer games? Were Spielberg's motives so noble, so pure and so righteous that he had to further propagate his ""war-is-naughty"" message to the fans of first person shoot-em-ups? Now you may argue that it is hardly Spielberg's job to worry about such things. This may be true  but you have to wonder why it was that Saving Private Ryan is so eminently suited to such a transfer. It is difficult, for example, to anticipate a Thin Red Line or Apocalypse now video game. It would also difficult to paste scenes from Thin Red Line onto, say, Star Wars (the Millennium Falcon coming out of the sun, for example) and not be able to spot the difference.At best Saving Private Ryan is a lukewarm, melodramatic, overly sentimental paean to good ole America, good ole family and the importance of killing nasty Germans before they kill you.

The best WW2 film and one of the best films I have ever seen.,"This film is absolutely brilliant, it is a must watch for anyone who likes war films. Even if you aren't too keen on them, you should still watch it; it would be a mistake to miss it. It has some very good action scenes that hit hard and leave you wanting more and some extreme tension later on in the film. The opening scene on Omaha Beach still stands as one of the best openings to date. It manages to make you care about almost all of the characters it follows, it will even make you care about Vin Diesal! That's an achievement right there. If you have seen Band of Brothers but not this film, you owe it to yourself to watch this. If you have seen this film and enjoyed a lot much like I did, check out HBO's Band Of Brothers mini series, it is fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

This movie, with its' phenomenal cast, brings the characters in the movie to life, and sends a message to the audience that war is, in fact, unpleasant. This team of Army rangers set off to save the life of one man; tells the story of their journey and how hope is a driving force that keeps the team alive.

Typical saccharine pap from Spielberg,"The greatest war movie ever?  Come on, folks, who are you trying to kid. While SPR is certainly a technical tour de force, in emotional, spiritual, historical and narrative terms it stinks, for the same reason most of Spielberg's films (with the exception of Schindler's List, marvellous) stink:  the man has no vision, and little or no artistic integrity.  (Why else does he churn out rubbish like Jurassic Park II? I'll tell you why - money.)SPR is dishonest, silly and trite, an insult to the men who died in the real D-Day landings.  The story premise, as others here have pointed out, is risible, the framing device unnecessary and stupidly sentimental.  How anybody over the age of 9 can rate this film higher than genuine masterpieces such as Paths of Glory, All Quiet on the Western Front or Cross of Iron is beyond me.  Still, a lot of people who visit this site think Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are the greatest films ever made, which probably explains something.Watch the first 20 minutes, and then switch off.

THE war movie of the last 20 years,"As the bullets thud into the still falling bodies of the men on Omaha Beach, Spielberg had already sold me.The sheer finality of every bullet - no men miraculously surviving fatal shots, no people dying honourably, but the very real and palpable horrors of war.""Saving Private Ryan"" does what all films movies have strived to from then on: creating dread, a sense of impending doom, a hopelessness in a war they have no control over, and yet still building a brilliantly human cast.Tom Hanks, for my money, is at his best here, a dryly funny man who the company will follow to the ends of the Earth, but who fully understands the brutality of war. The supporting ensemble is full of faces you'll have seen since - particularly that of Private Ryan himself, Matt Damon - and there's good reason, given the ubiquitous nature of strong performances.War often feels contrived and unrealistic in this adaptations, but here it feels gritty and real; the fight scenes are beautifully crafted and varied, and some of the cinematography is deceptively excellent.There is a definite 'patriotism' angle, but the surrounding quality is so high that I can forgive this normally cringeworthy pandering. Frankly, only the equally superb ""Band of Brothers"" can rival this movie in terms of accuracy, emotion and beauty.""Saving Private Ryan"" is the last true war epic that has been produced, and I can only hope to see another.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

This is one of the greatest movies ever made.,"To think that this movie did not win Best Picture is a crime. Director Steven Spielberg uses all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever made.Though it's true that this is not the type of movie you want to sit down with the family and eat popcorn, the emotional drive of the picture, the story's poignant messages, and the fantastic acting of the cast draws you into a world that is both dangerous and unpredictable.Spielberg is able to take you into action and make you feel as if you are a participant in the movie and not just a viewer. This is Tom Hanks' best movie he ever did. Forget his performances in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump (though they were also good); he should have received another Oscar for the role of Capt. John Miller, a leader who must act strong in front of his men, but must also hide his emotions from them. It would have been well-deserved if he won again.I give this movie my highest recommendation. Saving Private Ryan is a movie that makes you realize how life is precious and how honor and duty, though they are deep philosophical concepts that are praised in war, can put you in jeopardy of losing your life for something you may not believe in.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Spielberg's genius and a very talented cast make history of history,"Without a doubt the greatest film about WWII ever made, and perhaps the greatest war film ever made (rivaled only by Platoon and Apocalypse Now). And while the opening Normandy beach scene is gripping, the final battle scene where the soldiers attempt to defend the bridge in the French town is so stunningly realistic, so brutally real and full of pathos that it is the best battle scene yet put to film. What an amazing, intense reminder of the depth of the sacrifice those who've given their lives in the horrors of combat have truly given to the rest of us.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Weak plot and uninspired characterisations betrays special effects and cinematography,"I've been put off writing this review for many years because I feared it would turn out to be a negative pile of invective directed against a man whose work I have largely admired for many years. Now though I've mellowed and with the film coming up to 20 years old and there being already more than 2000 reviews already on this website I'm confident nobody is going to waste time reading this review anyway.So, what can you say about the first 25 minutes? Probably the finest piece of action film making ever. This opening ruined every war film I saw before and every war film I've seen since; nothing comes close (apart from BoB of course). Exceptional! And for me that is the strange thing about this film – part of it fills me with rapture, while other parts make me cringe and irritated.But let's get onto the story. Well I'm no military expert but sending a handful of men, some of them high value experienced soldiers, out into the French countryside to find a Unit with a certain individual in it – well I'm not sure I buy it. No, the story is weak and disappoints, as do the over familiar characterisations.Alright then we move onto the inevitable, and the source of all the carping from all the other non-US reviewers of this film - the lack of representatives from other allied nations. Well the answer the great man gave is very much the same as many defenders of this film provide on this website – that this is a war film concentrating on the US sectors and their German adversaries. Sounds reasonable enough – doesn't it? It's also sound film making as well as keeping it simple ensures audiences don't get confused with all those different uniforms and dodgy accents.The only problem, well only if historical accuracy of real events bothers you, is that Historians tell us the demarcation between the sectors wasn't that clear cut. As James Holland of CNN states by quoting the actual resources provided respectively by the US and the British, if you were a GI there was a very good chance you would leave the English coast in a British Royal Naval vessel. You would more than likely transfer into a British Royal Naval Landing craft. If you needed air support it would be almost definitely provided by the British Royal Air Force or Royal Canadian Air Force. While the night time air drops apparently deposited paratroopers all over the place and not necessarily where they should be. (Remember, this was the reason given for not knowing where Ryan was.) The statistics tell us this, these are facts. So, although it is possible a 'Yank' could fail to encounter a 'Limey', 'Canook', or 'Free French' on June 6th 1944, it would be very unlikely.I'm reminded of an interview the great man did to promote the film in the UK for the BBC. When he was challenged about this point he gave the example of 'The Dambusters' as a British war film that just concentrated on the double header of Brits versus Germans. Sorry 'Steve' not a great example. Unfortunately the young interviewer either didn't know his war films or didn't fancy irritating his esteemed interviewee.The Dambusters features Australians, New Zealanders, South Africans, and Rhodesians along with the English/Welsh/Scots/Irish. There's a scene where they are selecting crews for the mission when Colin Todd, as Guy Gibson, exclaims: ""Hang on, don't forget the English!"" Even the jingoistic extravaganza that was the 1969 film 'The Battle of Britain' included a Polish fighter squadron in recognition of the brave and resolute contribution they made to the defence of the UK.There is also a plot problem with omitting allies from the story in that you have nobody to portray as inferior, incompetent, and cowardly (tick as appropriate) to compare with your own brave square jawed heroes (Think: The Hurt Locker and those useless Brit mercenaries). You don't want your enemy appearing pathetic, evil yes, but they have to be a worthwhile foe to legitimise the struggle towards victory. So this film tries to get around this restriction by including a dig at the British General Montgomery, the overall planner of Operation Overlord (D-Day), but not a man universally popular even within his own nation.While it is entirely realistic that troops from one Army criticise the performance of another the way it is done here – out of the blue exposition and with no supporting evidence, exposes this line for what it actually is: a cheap shot.So perhaps these facts explain why many reviewers have been disappointed about others nations' exclusion. In order to allow US audiences to identify with the film, and others around the world (Some French and Germans both have their own reasons for depreciating the role of the British, but that's another contentious point!), history has been bent for commercial purposes to produce what looks to some (including me), a mean spirited and self-centred production.This film gets so many things right, and gets them excellently 'right' so the areas where they get things wrong stand out as really, really wrong; and that is the chief problem with this film. It goes to great trouble and expense to present realistic events and situations for certain parts of the film, but in other parts it is lazy and dismissive.I wonder if Mr Spielberg was ever the slightest bit bothered by this international hoo-hah? I wonder on cold winter evenings when he's at home polishing his 'Knight of the British Empire Medal' for taking advantage of the lower production costs in the UK, erm I mean services to the British film industry, he feels the slightest bit guilty. Of course not, that is a ridiculous image; cast it from your minds immediately. He will have a professional come in and polish all of his awards!",5.0,Anonymous,Drama

SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (DIDIER BECU),"I saw this movie is included in the Top 250 and to be quite honest, I just don't understand why. The most realistic warmovie ever made? Perhaps because of the special effects (those first 20 minutes are indeed horryfying) but the sole reason why that is like that is just because ""Saving private Ryan"" is the kind of warmovie they don't make any longer, but believe me, if ""The longest day"" or any other warepic would have been made these days it would have been exactly the same as this Spielbergmovie. Surely not a bad movie at all, even worth your time (and even more than that) but Spielberg tries a bit too hard to make it an anthem to those who lost their live in one of the biggest tragedies the world has known, but then again every war is a tragedy (I see no difference in a soldier dying in France or somewhere in Palestina). Spielberg is not afraid to show the cruelity of war and if you are softhearted you will close your eyes more than once. Good movie, even a bit more than that but just don't overrate it as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A myopic, americentric view of the human side of war","When it came out, Saving Private Ryan was lauded for it's ""realistic depiction of war,"" and for its ""attention and sensitivity to the common man caught up in the sway of forces far beyond his control."" It was supposed to be a story about the men more than a story about the war.Unfortunately, it was none of these things.The message of this movie seems to be that war is a very deeply affecting and moving experience, as long as you're an American. Common everyday plain old American Teachers, as shown by Tom Hanks' character, are sent into the fray and forced to become fighting men. We are shown, however, that the humanity of that Teacher is still there, even as he is fighting the ""Evil Bloodthirsy Germans.""And this is where my problem lies. How can a movie that uses cookie cutter Nazis, that treats German soldiers as simply ""the enemy,"" even make the claim that it is a realistic depiction of war? Somehow, only the Americans in Saving Private Ryan have a human component, the Germans conveniently having lost theirs. Compare this with the Japanese soldiers shown in The Thin Red Line and you'll see that Saving Private Ryan's praise for being an understanding and sensitive picture of that war is little more than a joke.Now, I'm not saying i do not understand why the Germans are depicted as so flat. If I were Jewish and had family members who had been in concentration camps, I probably wouldn't be able to depict Germans in anything but a dehumanized capacity either. Having said that, however, the dehumanizing of the enemy, the labeling of a people and the flattening of their character and humanity, is what allowed the Germans to kill so many Jews.This movie is anything but a realistic depiction of the Second World War.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama
An excellent cinematographic work that perfectly portrays the pain of soldiers,"After Schindler's List and Empire Of The Sun, Steven Spielberg has made yet another portrait of World War II that is as amazing and moving as the previous two films. Spielberg is someone who has quite a bit of recognition in the world of science fiction, but his greatest skill is telling deep stories with very human characters and he manages to do that through any film genre. In the case of war films, he manages to do that while portraying the wounds left by the horrors of war.Saving Private Ryan already captures the viewer's attention from the beginning with a shocking combat scene. This scene takes up more than the first 30 minutes of the film and with that he manages to make the viewer enter into the story. After that very effective introduction, the film follows Captain Miller and his squad in search of Private Ryan. What we see is a much more realistic and dramatic story of soldiers in a war zone. There is a good balance between action and drama making the combat sequences spectacular and at the same time feeling quite tense when seeing the soldiers in danger. The action scenes feel like real, gritty, dangerous situations. They adequately recreate the carnage that was caused in the middle of the battlefield. We see how the bodies of the soldiers are torn apart in the explosions, making the fighting quite raw.The acting is so good that you can see the sense of horror and fear that the soldiers felt in such a situation reflected. Also, when the soldiers are not fighting, we see them having conversations that don't seem like much, but it shows that the soldiers are human beings with goals and hopes. The rescue mission happens because one of the high command began to reflect on what it is like for a mother to lose all her children in the war. While three brothers have died, saving the fourth brother who might still be alive is a humanitarian act that offers a sliver of hope that some soldiers will be able to survive to return home to their families. A dream that the soldiers themselves have and that is captured in the film. We even see that Ryan is willing to fight to make sure that some of his comrades can return home. While there are soldiers who fight only to follow orders, in this film we see that the soldiers fight for their comrades and for the desire for them to survive. War films have offered different facets of war and the soldiers who participate in it. Some in a heroic way, others as a torment that causes psychological damage and the rest focusing more on the humanity of the soldiers. Steven Spielberg had focused on the humanity of the soldiers with this film using what he had done in his previous war films. In addition, it retains some more common elements of American war films such as patriotism and American pride or the heroism of a soldier sacrificing his life to save another.All of this makes this a masterpiece of war cinema by portraying both the pain of the soldiers and the brutal battles with excellent precision. There is no doubt that Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war films in history that has managed to endure thanks to its good plot and special effects. It should not even be forgotten that the filming techniques for combat scenes influenced war films, action films and even superhero films long after the film was released. Although it has fictional elements and some historical errors, that does not erase the fact that Saving Private Ryan is a great film with an accurate view of war. It is ideal to know how horrible and painful it was to fight in war. My final rating for this film is 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good story,"It's hard not to agree with the opinion of those who consider the battle scenes of Saving Private Ryan to be the best in the history of cinema.

Historically Accurate and really Pacifist,"Saving Private RyanSaving Private Ryan is a good World War 2 movie based on a true story.The movie was directed by Steven Spielberg. The movie tells the story of a squad of men who where ordered to look for a soldier named private Ryan. The film is set in a war-torn France on June 1944. The main characters are played by Tom Hanks,Edward Burns,Matt Damon,Tom Sizemore.The movie starts when a world war 2 veteran walks into the cemetery and sees a grave of his comrade. He falls to his feet and then a flashback happens. Then the set changes and you see Omaha Beach for a few minutes before the assault begins. Then we see a landing craft on which the main character Ranger Captain John.H.Miller is getting ready for disembarkment. Then many of the men who landed on the beach were shot and killed and some got shot in their legs and had their hands torn off, but they got into the Nazi position and won the battle. Later in the movie captain Miller was issued an order to save a private from behind the enemy lines.I think film succeeded in showing its pacifist massage.

The great thing about this movie is the fact, the camera hovers around in such a manner, it places you right amidst the action. This is war, as it happened, bloody, brutal and relentless. The 27 min long, famous opening sequence alone makes this a must watch. It's technique was revolutionary when it released, and has been replicated many a times, but none so better than the original.

The master creates magic- One of the greatest WW2 films ever.,"Most World War II movies fall into one of two categories: heroic tales of glory and valor or biopics but Saving Private Ryan is neither. Instead, it's a condemnation of war wrapped in a tale of human courage and sacrifice. There's nothing especially complex about the structure of Saving Private Ryan. The film, which runs nearly three hours, is bookended by two major battle scenes. In between, smaller fights alternate with quiet, character-building moments that flesh out the soldiers, allowing them to escape the threat of stereotyping. Spielberg, along with writer Robert Rodat and the actors, ensures that everyone in the movie is developed into a multi-dimensional individual for whom we can grieve if and when they die. The action sequences are some of the best ever captured in any genre and the opening Omaha landing sequence which runs almost half an hour is a tour de force of filmmaking. This film is simply unmissable.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Much more than its opening sequence,"Steven Spielberg is the most effortlessly inventive technical director alive. He's placed shots in this film that move effortlessly from one subject to another, all the while each moment provides a new piece to the story. His inventiveness isn't showy or extraneous, but subtle and key to moving the story forward. In Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg uses his extreme technical proficiency to tell a very engaging story about the nature of war.The opening sequence of D-Day is the obvious standout in the film. As a dramatization of the landing in Normandy, it's terrifying in effect as it gives us perspective from the beginning of the action to its relative conclusion through Captain Miller. The physical reality of the movement from the landing craft to hiding behind the metal barriers to the beachhead up to the towers. Men get blown apart, and yet the mission has to continue. By the time a soldier deflects one bullet off his helmet miraculously and shot gets shot in the same spot again, but without his helmet, there's a certain desensitizing influence happening to the audience, and that is reflected in how Captain Miller just shrugs off that, and other, moments of extreme violence. There's no time to mourn the dead. There's a mission to accomplish and a beach to take.That effect is at the heart of the film, especially when Miller is given PR mission of marching dozens of miles into the fighting of France to find a single soldier who's lost all three of his brothers to the fighting. He doesn't understand why he should risk his own life and the lives of his men to save one. Their thoughts have turned inward, towards their own self-preservation, having lost sight of the war at large and the other men in uniform around them. This comes to its ironic height when Miller and his men find a downed plane and root through the dog tags of dead soldiers. It's a game to them, and it takes the outsider of their group, Upham, to reorient them real quick with a bit of shaming.Losing two of their number does not help Miller's troops in believing in the mission. Why should they have lost two guys to help the one? Ryan, though, hasn't lost sight of why he's there, and he refuses to go back home. He doesn't talk about the overall war, though. He talks about his fellow men and the bridge they've held for days. Even Miller has talked about how his primary goal in this war was to find a way to go home, and suddenly this kid he's supposed to escort away from danger and to his mother in Iowa is refusing to take even the first step back. He knows his place, and he's going to stay.That dedication reinvigorates Miller and his men, refocusing them. Gone is the antagonism towards Ryan. He couldn't help that his three brothers all died and that the military leadership wanted to help his mother over theirs by getting him home, but they can respect his insistence on staying and fighting.On top of all that, what sets this movie apart from most men on a mission stories is two things. The first is the small character moments. In a movie that has two fantastically large action sequences (D-Day and the Battle at Ramelle), its best moments are very small. The scene in the church at night, as the men talk to each other, each dealing with the loss of one of their men in different ways, is a marvelous look into the minds of men caught in the middle of Hell (my favorite being Wade's story about how he tried to stay awake for his mother), but there's also Ryan's story of home. He talks about how he can't remember the faces of his deceased brothers and moves to talking about the last time all four were together. It's happily nostalgic of what he's lost that ends on a melancholy note. It's a very nice way to really let us get to know this almost MacGuffin that we've heard about for nearly the whole movie.The second thing that sets it apart is the aforementioned technical acumen of Steven Spielberg. There's a shot late in the film that has stuck with me. It's not a dramatic shot in any way shape or form, but the way it evolves transfixed me from the moment I noticed it. We start with the shot of an M1-Garand clip that gets locked into the rifle. The camera pulls back slightly to look at the stern face of the soldier performing the action, and then it focuses out of the building to Upham who's running across the bridge out in front to hide in a crater. It's a shot that lasts about 5 seconds, but it's complex in a subtle way. It's all about showing different parts of the preparation for the upcoming fight, showing us tiny details that add up to a whole. It's also an almost throwaway moment that shows so much forethought and pitch perfect execution.The movie is a technical marvel matched with great performances and an interesting story about the numbing effects of war. It's a men on a mission story that rises above its genre to become truly affecting for the lost men. It is one of Steven Spielberg's greatest films.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Unearned,"Spielberg does to Kurosawa and Welles what Mark McGwire did to Roger Marris in the magnificently staged battle scenes that bookend this D-Day melodrama. His beach-storming opening pushes the how-much-can-you-stand? envelope about twenty feet farther than even the most daring moments in SCHINDLER'S LIST; he seems to have an unerring sixth sense for the audience's breaking point. And the climax--a cat-and-mouse game between the spottily armed American platoon and a series of tank-bound Germans--suggests a set piece from THE GREAT ESCAPE with nineties technology and Spielbergian horse sense.It was Spielberg's derring-do that made this movie a monster hit--not the star presence of Tom Hanks as the saver and Matt Damon as the saved. And it certainly wasn't the script, which affords Spielberg a few opportunities for nicely offhand, verite-ish, lived-in scenes, but consists mostly of Tom Hanks staring at a distant cloud and delivering the most sentimental ""unsentimental"" bromides in a war movie ever. Hanks is supposed to be a scruffier, more cynical and wised-up version of the Henry Fonda Good American. His monologues of common, simple decency have the numbing monotony of a centrist Democrat Senator dedicating a new high school. Hanks morphing into a latter-day Jimmy Stewart is dismal enough; the speechifying by members of his platoon, especially the unendurable Ed Burns commemorating his girl-back-home's mammoth breasts, take the movie to flatline status. (The script was uncreditedly rewritten by Frank Darabont, of the poor-man's-Spielberg SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.)",,Anonymous,Drama

I would love to see him use some creative material like his 70's movies such as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".

An accurate representaion of Brotherhood,"Saving Private Ryan captures the attention of viewer in a unique manner, it disorients them. The viewer is consumed by the troubles of war and is quickly thrown into battle. Saving Private Ryan follows the men who stormed the beaches of Normandy and end up on a mission to find Private Ryan and inform him of his brother's death on the battlefield. The film accurately demonstrates brotherhood and the life of a soldier in war at that time. It shows that there is no feat to tough for a U.S soldier and that they will do anything for their comrades.
Private Ryan is played by Matt Damon and the quest to find him is led by Captain Miller who is played by Tom Hanks. Captain Miller leads many men to find Private Ryan. Some notable key characters are Private Jackson, a deadeye sniper played by Barry Pepper, and Private Caparzo played by Vin Diesel, who teaches the viewers how soldiers had to deal with losing a brother in arms in battle.
Not many movies or series can capture the fear, emotion, and courage of men at war who will do anything in the name of brotherhood. The series, Band of Brothers, released 3 years after Saving Private Ryan in 2001 is the closest to this theme in my opinion.
The film establishes motif with correct angles, lighting, and sound to accurately show the cost of war on June 6th 1944 when the U.S stormed the beaches of Normandy. The angles used capture the animosity of war and the sound effects place you right in the middle of it. The scene that uses these techniques the best opens dark, gloomy, and unnervingly calm. You can sense the battle ahead. Angles show quick glimpses of the men shaking in the boats headed toward the shore. Some vomiting, and some kissing their cross. No one says a word, their nerves are choking them into silence. The time ""30 seconds"" is yelled to the soldiers as Captain Miller briefs his men, the camera starts from the rear of the boat and zooms out slowly to show the emotion on each mans face and in the trimmers of their bodies. Nothing can prepare them for what is to come. Nothing ever could.
The films use of all the techniques listed help the audience to learn more about the brotherhood of soldiers. Through death and perseverance, the film uses the correct lighting to set the mood and angles to capture the moment each soldier was living in. I highly recommend this film to anyone who would like to understand brotherhood and the trials of battle the U.S soldiers endured in 1944.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

No holds barred,"Spielberg returns to World War II and as usual, does not hold back from a chaotic and brutal portrayal of war. From the first scene, the viewer is assaulted with a realistically violent and gory battle that does not leave room for a break. As a way to involve the audience in an immersive experience of war, this is a perfectly mastered technique. However, the amount of disorientation can be excessive, as I often had trouble hearing the dialogue or distinguishing which soldiers were on which side. Other than that, the toll on the soldiers becomes the main emotional crux of the film although I felt that this pathos was quite forced at times - how many times can we hear a dying soldier cry for their ""mama""? And what was with the French family living in the ruins? Some of this seemed contrived just to play on the audience's heartstrings.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"The actual ""opening scene"" and it's impact on me","I am not really sure why I feel compelled to post my experience when watching this movie but after reading many of the previous comments it is apparent that the impact for me is quite different than most other people.I went to our local theater to see Saving Private Ryan with my teenage son and one of his friends.  I was fully prepared for the realistic beach landing sequence that had already gained so much attention prior to the film's release so what happened next is a personal experience I will never forget. The actual ""opening scene"" is NOT the battle sequence but the images of the elderly Ryan and his family visiting the American cemetery at Normandy, France.  In the span of a few seconds,  I was transported back in time and place to a raw spring day in 1982 at the beaches of Normandy, France. It was there, with my late Father and Mother, that we walked the same path along the cliffs as shown in the film. My wife and children were with me (as in the film) when my Dad turned and walked out among the sea of crosses and was overcome with emotion (as in the film). The horrors of war were never more apparent to me in a personal way than at that moment.It was as if Spielberg had been there 30 years ago and somehow filmed our family and then edited it onto the beginning of this movie.  I was so shaken that I barely remembered the rest of the movie and it was quite a while before I could get up and leave the theater. I am normally not prone to emotional outbursts and was embarrassed that I could not stop crying even as we left the lobby.  My reaction scared my son half out of his wits since he had no idea what had hit me so hard (he was only 2 years old in 1982).I have only watch the film once since then and the impact was just as powerful. I have often wondered if anyone else relates to this scene as I do since every other reference to the opening scene is actually the beach landing.For me, the cinematic faults or virtues of this movie are irrelevant in relation to the pain and sacrifice that this war inflicted on the world and I believe there is value in the way this film helps to assure that the pain will never be forgotten.",,Anonymous,Drama
flag waving,"Poor old mister Speilberg. He was so upset when he did not win the Oscar for this movie. Well if he stop shoving the American way down everybodys neck then maybe he would have done better. Those flag waving scenes at the start and end were some of the worst bits of judgment when it came to directing that I have seen for many years. Next time he should watch ""The Thin Red Line"" to see how not to be all happy about the cruelty of war.

Awful. Loathsome. Repellant. Unworthy of Spielberg.,"Here we have another in the series of Spielberg formula drek.  Mr. S. has stumbled on a great gimmick...  he makes films that may not be disliked because of some taboo or other.  To dislike Schindler's List is to not be sympathetic with the Jews who were killed by Nazis.  To dislike Forrest Gump is to not be properly respectful of retarded people.  Give me a break.  Now we're all supposed to like Saving Private Ryan because if we don't it means we don't understand that war is bad or appreciate the sacrifice made by all the people who died during WW II?  Spare me.Without all the emotional baggage, SPR is an awful movie.  The plot is trite.  The writing labored and formulaic and it in no way justifies the emotional bludgeoning delivered by the opening sequence.I will admit that the opening sequences is probably the most powerful half hour of film ever to be projected on a movie screen.  Spielberg know all the emotional buttons we have and how to push them.  He was a brilliantly manipulative filmmaker 25 years ago and he's only gotten better.  That being said, did Mr. Spielberg forget to actually add a story?  Lots of movies deal with the ugly side of humanity.  The Shawshank Redemption is a perfect example of how to show these things in the context of a riveting story.  I guess the most disappointing aspect of this is that we all know that Spielberg can do better.  He has done better.  He has made some of the greatest American films of all time.  He, of all people, should remember that and remember that every time he makes one of these ponderous abominations he is desecrating the memory of films like Duel and Jaws... and even The Lost World.

good,"Saving private ryan.
We have looked into the lesson saving private ryan here is our review.
Direction: the direction was well done because, some scenes were also running and you also saw the action that occurs sometimes they had also filmed it underwater to really show the action that happenedScript: the script was very realistic because some characters spoke different languages, for example when Germans wanted to surrender, they didn't speak German but a different language.
The people who were in the war themselves had said in advance how it had gone and afterwards also looked and approved.Editing: the editing was very aggressive, they started filming death by scene, making it appear that it is very aggressive and the organs from the body and medical help also came to help and the body parts were also taken off and that very quicklySuit design: the suit design was very clear they were wearing a helmet to protect their head and you saw a scene when a person took off his helmet and was immediately shot at his head. you saw that it clearly looked real army clothing and not bad.Set design: the start was very realistic they sail to a beach where the Germans were with a base and they had blockages for the boats so that the opponent had to swim to the other side, everything looked very realistic.background music: sometimes no music so it still seemed serious.
and when it was music, it was the right music, for example the horns in the background it was emotional.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Masterpiece in Two Acts,"I watched Saving Private Ryan for the first time in 20 years at the request of my 17 year old son, who was curious about it. I remembered the movie somewhat, but had to prepare myself for the intense experience that I knew was coming. The movie was even better the second time around.Saving Private Ryan is basically a movie in two parts. Most everyone focuses on the first 24 minutes, a dramatization of the horrific landing on Omaha beach that rightly can be said to have changed the history of film-making. I cannot personally tell you if it was realistic, but many veterans, including some who participated in the event, seem to claim that Hollywood finally got it right. If Saving Private Ryan had ended after this scene, it would already be a major achievement. Viewers should beware that Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944 is NOT anyplace that you would really want to be, and that this scene should be handled with care.What follows, however, is equally interesting, as we learn that a paratrooper is missing and that his three brothers have all been recently killed. We see a shot of General Marshall, who is Chief of Staff and therefore a sort of God of War, about to wrestle with history in an interesting way. He reads a letter written by Abraham Lincoln consoling a Civil War mother who has lost all five of her sons, and as he reads it he realizes that it is impossible for him to allow this event to happen again--it is too cruel. He then orders his own remarkable cruelty, a mission in which a squad from the first wave of Omaha Beach is assigned to go rescue him, and we and all the movie characters and everyone else in the theater are left wondering if it is either worth it or fair.I think what Spielberg is after here is a point about the arbitrariness of war, and perhaps even life itself. Some people live, and some die, and often for quite peculiar reasons. This makes for extremely intense drama, for it really is impossible to predict in the movie's logic what is going to happen next. The Omaha Beach scene is also put in context: for some people, life gets absolutely terrifying and unfair, but even this notion is ambiguous--it would be difficult to claim that the Omaha Beach soldiers who died did so for no good reason.For taking us to new heights of terror and new depths of ambiguity, Saving Private Ryan deserves much credit. Some have pointed out some of the unrealistic aspects of this movie, and there are some. All of this can be tolerated, however, because this movie takes us to new places and gives us new insights about our humanity.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Spectacular war-movie,"Saving Private Ryan is Steven Spielberg`s second world-war2-themed film(the first was the excellent Schindler`s List). We follow some American soldiers who are fighting against Hitler`s Wehrmacht in Normandie.  The opening scene is spectacular and extremely violent, but then that was how the Allies managed to get over the English channel and over to France. The movie is very good, it has both realistic war-scenes and great drama(although The Thin Red Line focuses more on drama). All in all I can honestly say that Spielberg has gone and delivered the goods again, and what we have here is yet another important movie.  I prefer this over The Thin Red Line, even if it doesn`t have the excellent soundtrack of The Thin Red Line. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

It revivifies the themes and the meaning of the film all over again and a perfect promotion for what upgrading the quality of films can do for them. This too happened with Apocalypse, Now: Final Cut.Saving Private Ryan is a film constructed to say so much with so little, the characters of the film follow the same rule, effortlessly watchable with no one painted with broad strokes and left, like comrades, with their depth and uniqueness just bubbling beneath the surface. The aural soundscape is second to none, overwhelmingly impressive and immersive.There's nothing sadistic about this film and yet it is brutal and pulls no punches.

Complete loss of realism,"When I read the first ten comments I was shocked how easily the audience accepts everything it gets served by names like Spielberg. The only positive exception I saw is Mark Welch.When I saw the first 40 minutes I was really surprised how realistic Spielberg's pictures and the plot were. After they took the beach he produced just another one of those average ""let 10 Americans beat the German army"" movies.Why did it have to be a set-up like that: It was not just 200 infantrists + 10 tanks vs 20 GI's (of course none was black!), but the WaffenSS, the German elite troops, which had quite some fighting experience from Russia. It was the same plot than hundreds before. Let the idiots take the main road, we attack from the sides.What would have happened: - the church tower would have been blown up before any Germans would have entered the town, as snipers are not that new - a small group of German soldiers would have checked the town - ...So, I probably saw 2 movies on the same day, the best and the worst war movie of the year. It doesn't surprise me, that the good part, was just a visually great set-up of a fixed plot, whereas when Spielberg was writing the story, it turned out to be worst rubbish.

A Movie We Don't Need,"The movie is nothing but a dummy package. Under the guise of a feigned authenticity - the construction of unreflecting patriotism, tear-jerking worship of heroes, a naive black-and-white portrayal and a pathetic ""good against evil"" mentality - it does not leave a doubt that only a dead German is a good German. Tom Hanks and the folks gathering around him may do a good job, but still cannot avoid the old cliché: Captain Miller's colorful troop is not much more than the regular bunch of war movie stereotypes who mutate to heroes. Where the Vietnam movies of a Oliver Stone (Platoon) or of a Stanley Kubrick (Full Metal Jacket) mercilessly condemn, do Spielberg's shocking pictures justify all committed atrocities in retrospect. Therefore this movie is rather a tribute to the US World War Veterans, than an anti-war movie. An absolution, which illustrates the horrors of war but not its senselessness.

I will never forget this overwhelming film,"I don't like war films. Definitely. But I definitely think ""Saving Private Ryan"" cannot be considered only like a war movie.

Not one, a bunch of steps far from the typical war film. It's not about the typical story of a ""how-strong-and-brave-I-am"" mercenary. The plot introduces us in the feelings, the experiences that a soldier has in a battle field: fear, agony & pain. And this message reached deeply in the audience, because you feel somehow uncomfortable when watching the film. And there's the power of the film, the way with which focuses the sensations and fearings of the character is overwhelming.Steven Spielberg has done a masterpiece, demonstrating that he can do any kind of genre in the film industry.

Save One People with Lives of EightPeople,"Saving Private Ryan, a film related to World War ll, directed by Spielberg, received critical acclaim upon screening. The upsurge of Saving Private Ryan is not only because it is realistic visual impact,what is more important, this film led to anargument about lives.

What else can we expect from Steven Spielberg, one of the best directors ever.Steven Spielberg seems to have a clear interest in making 2nd world war movies that are based on real events. He also directed WW2 blockbusters like ""Schindler's List"", ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" and ""Memoirs of a Geisha"". And let's not forget his involvement in the impressive WW2 shows ""The Pacific"" and ""Band of Brothers"".This movie clearly deserves to be named on a list that not only consists of the above-mentioned productions, but also top WW2 movies like ""Bridge over the River Kwai"", ""Platoon"" or ""Hacksaw Ridge"".

Stop with the idiosyncratic reasons why, exactly, the US simply joined an already successful enterprise. She didn't.

The great D-DAY sequence tells us about the insanity of war, and how awful and seemingly pointless it all is. But after two hours of walking around to further build on the whole insanity of war thing, the movie goes full circle right into hollywood. The ending attempts to justify all the madness, by saying that it's all worth it because you are fighting for matt damon and of course your country (as we fade out on the american flag). Mr. Speilberg and company, What exactly are you trying to tell us?NOTE: This movie pales in comparison to Terrance Malick's THE THIN RED LINE.Although I must say, if it came down to this movie and Shakespeare in love (perhaps the worst movie to ever win an oscar... oh wait thats titanic), I would have to go with this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
The most realistic view of war yet,"Firstly, this film is not 'entertaining' in the way war films like Pearl Harbour tried to be. This film attempts to re-create war as realistically as possible, and, although I've never been in one myself, from what I hear it is the best representation yet. By definition this means you cannot 'enjoy' it like you would most films. The opening scene at the beach during D-day was harrowing rather than enjoyable to watch. You don't find yourself on the edge of your seat as bullets fly, you find yourself cringing and wondering why on Earth people get driven to this. After this scene the film becomes less miserable and slightly more watchable as an entertainment mechanism, but it never loses its realistic touch. Hanks delivers a memorable if not slightly flawed performance, whilst the script is interesting to listen to. In general, this is the first film I have come across that truly played on my emotions and affected me, which is what it's meant to do. It is a fantastic achievement in the sense that it finally begins to show people just how real the horrors of war are. If you're looking for a nice night in with an action film, don't watch this. If you want to see closer to the truth, and appreciate truly great filmwork, watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Normandy Invasion; Upfront and Personal - Saving Private Ryan,"This film contains two of the most memorable scenes from any film I have ever seen. One scene, of course, is the landing on Normandy Beach. It affects you on a visceral level. The other scene, however, affects you from a deeply emotional level; and that is the delivery scene that includes the death of three brothers. One cannot even begin to fathom the emotional horror that the mother must have felt. Tom Hanks and Matt Damon are nicely cast as the commander in charge of retrieving Ryan and Ryan himself, respectively. After the invasion on the beach, the chills and thrills continue, as the soldiers have to go behind enemy lines to retrieve Ryan. This is one of the finest war films ever made. However, according to IMDB this film is not as good as Pulp Fiction or Fight Club according to its top 250 list.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

It's a FILM...,"It seems that those that are critical of SPR, they are all hypercritical for their own personal reasons.  Let's back up and look at this movie as a film- because that's all that it is, a film.  For those of you that see a representation of the Americans as the good ol' boys and the Germans as the bad guys, let's remember the scenes where the Germans were brutally shot at point blank range with their hands in the air to surrender.  Anyone who misses the point that the Germans were just as human as the Americans were, misses the point all together as I see it.I don't see where Spielberg makes them look any better or worse than we or any other soldier was in the war.As far as steering from the truth, anyone that has followed ANY historical movie knows that there are certain artistic licenses taken to embellish the depiction.  If historic films were depicted one hundred percent as they actually happened they would ALL fall under the documentary category.  This is NOT a documentary and shouldn't be judged as such.I purposely don't/haven't watched war films because I abhor violence and the use of violence as an ends to ANY means.  However I saw this film because I had heard that it is one of the best representations of what happened on Omaha Beach and the tragedies of war.  Never had I been so moved and truly felt how horrible it must have been to be there  or in any war.It is a film, and just that, a film.  An interpretation by Spielberg of what happened.  Be critical of what the film meant to you and how you feel, not of what was in the film.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Solid war movie, but highly overrated.","I know, I know: RYAN is supposed to be Spielberg's second SCHINDLER. But seriously: If you think about it, it's obviously not! Alright: The Omaha Beach scenes are really some of the most astonishing action sequences ever staged. However, the following story unfolds as a cliché-ed plot like any war story. It reminded me even of the pilot to TOUR OF DUTY. Tom Hanks leads a small platoon through enemy lines to save the last of four brothers, three were already killed in action. On this mission, some of the G.I.s get killed. The rest start pondering if this trip - if the war - is worthwhile. So far so good. To show that this movie is a deep one, Spielberg pulls the joker of showing the enemy in a humane way: ""Steamboat Willy"", a German officer doomed to get shot, who turns out to be just another nice guy, but from the wrong side. They let him get away. But when they encounter him the second time, the G.I. translator - who never before has killed anybody - has of course to shoot him, just to show that all Germans were demons after all. Hypocrisy! And all the discussions whether the effort was worth it are silenced, when Ryan turns out to be the bestest American boy ever! It could've been a far better film if Ryan was a) dead already, b) a cowardish and unlikable character, c) black, or d) just not to be found. THEN all the thoughts about the reason of war would have led somewhere. Now they are just a fig leaf to cover up a standard B-wartime flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A big disappointment,"I finally made time to see this film, expecting a visceral, emotional experience.  Instead I was (in order) bored, angry, sleepy, and bewildered. Is this the groundbreaking film that everyone was gushing over last year? From all the talk I expected a head-on assault at the beginning of the movie.  What I did see was a heavy-handed and frankly uninteresting battle scene.  From there the movie only got worse.  I didn't care a bit for any of the characters, least of all the Tom Hanks lead and the obnoxious Matt Damon.  While the film looked spectacular, that's all it was: surface. There was no depth whatsoever to any of the characters or situations.  I feel like maybe there is something wrong with me that I don't see what all the orgasmic gushing over this film is about.

"Saving Private Ryan: A sheer, hard truth about war","War is nothing of glory, prominence, or resolve. War is that of complete bloodshed and a reason that drives the motive to kill fellow man. War does not tell lies, nor do the bodies, wounds, and scars of the living and dead in a conflict between nations can hide from the truth. These same truths are what lead me to watch Saving Private Ryan, and how incredibly accurate the film depicts the monstrous and horrific nature of warfare. In the film, Saving Private Ryan, I will be examining how this true war story captures the true atmosphere of war and the many scenes that built up a character's development during this conflict in this amazingly heroic, action-packed, heartbreaking masterpiece of a film.War is man's worst nightmare, bringing horrible and disastrous acts of violence and mishap. However, one man, Steven Spielberg, delivers us one of the most convincing and realistic depictions ever in this insanely powerful and depressing film; ""Saving Private Ryan.""This courageous World War II film dives down deep and explores the struggle to keep the common soldier's sanity and humanity in the dead center of utmost hell. Showing the audience that Spielberg was very much on top of his game, as it truly conveys the sickening and heart-destroying emotions and feelings towards the audience, leaving them crying, shaking in their seats, or in an upward fetal position. And if this doesn't make you want to watch this film, I don't know what will. ""Sure."" You might say. ""But we've got really good films like Black Hawk Down and American Sniper."" But let me ask you this; ""did any of those movies cover the small details? Did they use specific scenes to visualize a character's development and emotions? And did they actually show gore and the true brutality that occurs in an actual war, in the film?"" To me, most other films seem to try to glorify and sugar coat over the truth, which is why I consider Steven Spielberg's work of art to be ""advanced"" for its time. A ""true"" war story never lies and it never should, which is why I recommend this film to you, even if it's genre isn't up your alley, you will find this movie to be absolutely groundbreaking and extraordinary. That I promise.Shortly after a brief scene with an elderly man at a WWII memorial site, we fade out into the perspective of Tom Hanks (Cpt. Miller) as it throws the audience right in the midst of the D-Day landings at Omaha Beach. Joining Miller on this slaughterhouse of a mission is a squad of loyal but mixed characters. There's Miller's shadow, Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), the cocky but confidential commoner from Brooklyn, New York, Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns), the upstanding Italian, Pvt. Caparzo (Vin Diesel), the tough, role model, Jewish kid, Pvt. Mellish (Adam Goldberg), the worrisome and sympathetic medic, T/4 medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), the Bible-quoting marksman, Pvt. Jackson (Barry Pepper) and the scared-as-hell interpreter, Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davis). As the ramp goes down, the crew is met with a hellstorm of gunfire. Different angle and panning shots shows U.S. soldiers getting cut down as bullets rip and tear through flesh and uniform, not even those who jumped over the side were safe, as it seen showing people drowning from the overhaul of gear that they were carrying. Even as the cast makes it to the coast, the camera continues to focus on the surroundings and the other grunts screaming, guts, blown off arms and legs, and even a caved-in face. Even though it takes up a good portion of the film, the scene does a phenomenal job at grasping the situation through Hank's perspective, as it doesn't try to hide anything from what the landings at Omaha were actually like, presenting us with realism like no other.On top of that, Steven Spielberg did an amazing job driving deep into character development, as I found that the most interesting parts of how the film and cast were presented and orchestrated, was the surreal fear and sadness that main cast acted out, including Cpt. Miller with his shaking hand, indicating towards the audience that he was just as human as the rest of his squad. Lighting also had a impact with depicting the character's fears, as one shot only shows Tom Hanks' face as the rest of his head and body is consumed by darkness, possibly to convey the theme of loss, as seen all throughout the rest of the movie. Other scenes include breaking down from the loss of characters, and the more human scenes and interactions of characters during the film makes it very irresistible to not want to smile.Overall, I enjoyed the film very much considering that I had never really seen such a vast difference in how war stories are told or how they play out, much like from video games and books. In my mind, I believe that this film takes the cake for its realism and atmosphere, amassing the audience towards a traumatizing but fateful story of heroes, not only laying down their lives for the sake of their country and its people, but revealing and teaching a lesson in it as well; that war does not lie, not until we as people find common ground, will the scars and wounds ever heal from our actions. In the film, Saving Private Ryan by Steven Spielberg, I will be examining how this true war story captures the true atmosphere of war and the many scenes that relayed a character's development and emotions during this haunting conflict in this amazingly heroic, action-packed, heartbreaking masterpiece of a film.",,Anonymous,Drama

One of the greatest movies ever made,"It's been more than ten years since I convinced my mom to take me to see Saving Private Ryan at the World premiere in '97. I was 16, and the movie had an R rating.Needless to say I had quite a surprise coming my way.Since I was a kid I've always been fond of War history and I have read countless books, seen documentaries and so on. Nothing however, have ever opened my eyes like Saving Private Ryan.In this masterpiece, Spielberg puts you right there on the beach. The excellent photography by Janusz Kaminski (for which he won an Oscar) and amazing sound effects in the breathtaking opening scenes is probably the best sequences in a movie ever. It really makes you feel like you're actually there in person.Where other war movies often glamorizes the soldier, gives war that romantic ""Hero"" touch, Saving Private Ryan hacks into your mind like no other movie. It is rough, chillingly brutal, and beautiful at the same time. It tries in no way to give you an illusion, it simply tries to give the audience the feeling of how it was like to be there.This is where Saving Private Ryan succeeds.I dare say that no other movie has managed to put a given scenario into such a breathtakingly good movie.As for the acting, Hanks does a fine job as Cpt. Miller. Even Vin Diesel - Mr. Testosterone - pulls of a convincing role as Caparzo. Giovanni Ribisi was for me maybe the biggest surprise of them all; I dare say his acting style was perfect for the role of Wade.All in all, I can't find any war movie better, and hardly any movie at all to compete from any category. As for war movies, Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece in itself but not even that comes close to SPR in describing the brutality of war.I used to love the idea of being a soldier.

One of the best,"Most of us will never know what it was like on Omaha Beach June 6, 1944. Saving Private Ryan has without a doubt been the most realistic war films ever made. This is as close as most of us will come to know what it was like that day on the beach. Every character in this movie is perfectly cast. Spielbeg shows us once again that he is one of the best directors of his generation. The way he makes every character in the movie seem like an everyman, is so realistic because after all these guys aren't superheroes. There normal blue collar guys who work for a living. This movie might just be the best war movie ever made, it is right up there with Patton, The Longest Day, and Stalag 17. Even if your not a war buff, watch it for the history.

"I did not like this movie, am I a gay iraqi communist?","Whoa, I have just read some of the other reviews and it seems that if you dont like this film you must be anti-american.Now dont get me wrong, the opening scene was brilliant but to me it quickly settled into being just another war movie albeit a well produced and shot war movie. You know, the good ol' USofA rising up above  insurmountable odds to save the day blah blah blah.I just could not accept the basic premise of the film that several men's lives were to be put at risk for the reasons given, I mean war is war, stuff like that happens.Having said that I could accept this scenario happening today, (re Jessica Ryan) with all the ensuing publicity.I think part of the problem was my expectation. I was expecting a real anti-war film, one that leaves you thinking, you know, that war is bad. This was just another good guys (America), bad guys (Germans) type film.If you want to see a real, and I mean real anti-war film you must see the 1930 version of ""All quiet on the Western front"". Ask me the ending of Private Ryan and in three months I wont be able to tell you, but our High School teacher made us sit through this when I was about 13/14 and to this day the final scene still jars me.Go see it, trust me, it will move you more than Ryan. (look it up on imdb it has scored 8.2 to ryans 8.3)But whats the use, people who gave Private Ryan a 10 will probably be bored with it because it is one war film that has little violence in it (and it is full of ""shudder"" Germans).",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
Think about the meaning of the second scene,"I went into Saving Private Ryan with high hopes.  As someone who has followed Spielberg's career since Jaws, I knew I would be put through the gamut of emotional responses during the movie.What I wasn't prepared for was the second scene.  I sat quietly through the recreation of the landing at Normandy, through the endless body parts being pitched into the air.  I was horrified at the sight of the armless soldier searching for his severed limb, the men trying to get out of the water before they drowned only to be cut down by bullets before they could.  I felt the tears well up in my eyes at the sights of these brave men, some of whom could have been my older uncles (my family fought there), giving their lives so that all of us could be free.Watching the screen fade from the shot of the dead soldier, sorrounded by dead fish in a red-hued sea change to the office of the war department.  Dozens of women typing letters to the families of those lost on the battlefield.  The tears didn't stop, they came on full force.  Luckily, my family was spared the horror of one of those letters, the visits by high -ranking men in uniforms coming to tell mothers and wives that their men wouldn't be coming back.  But, I felt for them.  All the battles, all the training, all the pride of having a family member fighting to keep the world free of evil meant nothing more than a letter home typed by a faceless secretary and passed along for signing.  Not that I'm putting down what these women did for the war effort.  They had their jobs to do as well.  It just touched me to no end to see this.  One minute a soldier is a brave man, fighting for his country and freedom, the next he is nothing more than a letter and a folded flag.I hope everybody, who sees this film, doubles their efforts in  making sure we as a species NEVER have to do that again.  Show this to future generations, along with Schindler's List, make them aware that the war did happen, that this kind of evil is possible.  We have had too many Rambos.  It's time we looked at the war the way it was; brutal, cruel and took the lives of too many men before they had the chance to live their lives.My hat is off to Mr. Spielberg once again.  Don't let us forget.",,Anonymous,Drama
Stop whining!,"I'm amazed at how much stupid some people manage to say...Let's just get a few facts straight. On Omaha Beach, Sector Dog Green, there were only americans. No brits, no canadians, no aussies, no russians, no polish, and so on. I know they all lost men, but on Omaha, and in Saving Private Ryan, there were just Americans. We have one story here, and it would be wrong to bring in people who weren't there. So if you want to see a movie about non-american soldiers in WWII, you should go and see something else, and not complain about this movie.And what kind of person can find the american flag in the end of the movie disgusting? 2500 men DID give their life on that beach in the fight for a free world, and here we have some b******(s) complaining about the flag. This movie is a tribute to the men who fought and died there. I say they should move to Cuba or China or Iraq, where those twisted ideas still live.It's a great movie that everybody should see. It's rated 18 (min 18 years old) here in Norway, which is a little high I think. It should be 15, so that schools could go and see it, so that we don't get more morons who takes freedom for granted.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

One Of The Cinematic Experiences Of My Life,"Watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" was one of my greatest cinematic experiences.The first twenty minutes of the film is truly astonishing. It's as if I was actually running up the beach, with bullets going all around me, slicing people to bits and bombs blowing off everywhere, tearing everyone to shreds. There was a feeling of total hopelessness of the existing and forthcoming carnage around me.I remember when I first saw the film, there was somebody left of me who was so traumatized by the Omaha invasion sequence, she covered her eyes and went out of the theater. There was a seemingly hardened old man right of me who said he has never have seen such horrifying experience in his life.Yes, this film has many flaws. I found the script to be very conventional and there were many corny cliches. The characters are not very well developed. Even the tank battle at the end, an amazing scene than matched the Omaha scene in tension, is pretty much Hollywoodized; it showed many military inaccuracies.  I had participated in message boards that many military analysts rightfully criticized the ending as being very unrealistic.However, it's still hard to not say this is a groundbreaking powerhouse of a war film that will (and had probably already) changed Hollywood war cinema forever. The intense violence of this film will teach generations of people that war is not fun and games. War really sucks.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Saving Private Ryan,"After the D-Day invasion of Omaha Beach, Ranger Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is tasked to put together a platoon of his choosing and find a paratrooper from the 101st Airbourne named Private James Ryan. With the platoon of his choosing (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies) sets off in treachorous wartime France to find Private Ryan amongst a field of full of enemies and a split up 101st Airbourne.World War I is often considering ""The Great War"" or ""The War to End All Wars,"" but few military conflicts have caught the hearts and minds of the American, and the world, consciousness the way that World War II has. For the first time during a war, films were made about the war as early as 1939. Some of the greatest war films and TV series have been based on World War 2 from The Sands of Iwo Jima to Flags of Fathers to Band of Brothers. At the end of the 20th century, with a career full of highly critically and commercially successful hits under his belt, Steven Spielberg took another turn at the war film (following 1979's 1941) with Saving Private Ryan.Saving Private Ryan is arguably the greatest war film ever made. The opening thirty minutes of the D-Day invasion is possibly the greatest scene ever committed to celluloid. But it's not just the harrowing scenes of war time that make this movie so great, it's the character building, the camaraderie between the soldiers, the devotion to duty, and the bravery of these men in combat. This movie truly depicts why World War 2 soldiers were possibly the greatest soldiers in US history.One of the great things about the casting in Saving Private Ryan is the fact that they chose actors that look like everyday men rather than picking men that look like action heroes, and because of that the acting in this movie is amazing. Tom Hanks gives a wonderfully authoritative and still understated performance as Capt. John Miller. Vin Diesel hasn't been this good since, and Barry Pepper as is sensational as religious sniper Pvt. Daniel Jackson. Even Jeremy Davies as the green Cpl. Upham makes you feel for his character despite his very obvious flaws as a soldier.The one thing that drags this movie down though is Spielberg's slavish devotion to sentimentality. The bookends to the film are completely unneeded and drags down what is otherwise an utterly great movie. Don't get me wrong, a former soldier's sentimentality for the one's who died to save him has it's place, I just feel as though that should have been more reserved for the former soldiers watching this movie remembering those who died with and for them then on the screen in this movie. Rather, the movie should have just been devoted to remembering the bravery and camaraderie of the men who fought in the war.Overall, though, in the scheme of things, despite the minor flaw that I have with this movie, it is definitely still the greatest movie in my mind dedicated to the men who have served our country. I don't just recommend this movie, if you haven't seen this you need to watch it, and now that it's out on Blu-Ray this is the perfect time to pick up this movie and watch it, or to watch it again.4.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing in Every Way,"From the invasions on Omaha Beach (D-Day), to the final battle in Ramelle, this movie was as action packed and graphic as possible. Anytime Spielberg and Hanks team up, it's pure gold. Especially this time. Personally, I was on the edge of my seat during the entire duration of this movie. If you're a war movie fan, I guarantee you that this will make the top of your list. This is as real as war can get on a TV screen. War movies completely changed after this film was released in 1998. It has influenced the film industry as much as any other movie out there. In my opinion, this is Spielberg's best work ever, as well as Hanks. There are so many realistic parts of this movie, it's insane. After all, it is based on a true story. People said that the D-Day scene was so accurate, it might as well had been real. When it comes down to it, this film is one of the most iconic films ever, and arguably the best war movie ever created.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

I expected more than a standard WWII movie with a bad Deus-Ex-Machina finale.The soundtrack is one of the worse Williams works and also the camera, dialogues and staging are not Spielberg's best.In addition, the tropes are known: The company leader who struggles trying to do the morally right things in war & to save his men's lives, the opponent from within the company who first speaks up, just to straight follow the lead a few minutes later, the hero who does not want to leave his brothers behind even if it cost his life and the pacifist (our identification) who struggles with the easiest tasks, is not ready to be in war, but luckily enough survives every encounter just to rise up at the end and avenge someone else's death. Nothing new, no morally intimidating questions or anything else. Just pure standard.I doubt that I will watch it again in the near future.

Everything from then on seemed a pale cliché of every other war movie I've ever seen, and I haven't seen all that many. Ooh the stars went through boot camp!

The Best Movie Ever Made..or not,"Laughable dialogue, hackneyed acting, war film cliches piled high (like Spielberg grafted on every single famous war movie scene he'd ever seen into a contradictory, muddled mish-mash: War is hell, war is noble, war is spirit changing, war is savage, war is uplifting, war is horrible, war is brotherhood, war is ironic, war is epic, war is petty etc. etc. this is how he cons the audience into concluding ""this is the best war movie ever made,"" that and the fact that many viewers are secretly titilated by the flying limbs and exploding bodies peppering this best war movie ever made.  I can just picture Stevie thinking 'I'll take this bit of Das Boot and combine it with Guadalcanal Diary and and then throw in some Apocalypse Now style irony and then...').Brilliant premise, as if the generals planning the largest sea-land invasion in history are worrying about a poor mother in Iowa. I like how all the characters are about as multi-layered as ""The Dirty Dozen,"" the cynical quipster Brooklyn, the clumsy rookie, the fast talking, Nazi hatin' Jew, the bible quoting expert-marksman southerner, the muscular guy, etc. etc.) Ridiculous monologues (Private Ryan: ""Picture a girl who took a nosedive from the ugly tree and hit every branch coming down. Haw Haw."" this from a character who symbolically represents America and has the movie named after him), banal bawdy soldier banter (Ed Burns ""She's a 44 Double E-who ah!"")My favorite part is when our heroes are behind enemy lines and then casually stumble around and tell jokes in loud voices-fitting with the film's total lack of military realism, especially the action movie ending where the plucky heroes take out a legion of tanks with Richard Dean Anderson-like ""sticky bombs"". Silly patriotism, maudlin and sappy John Williams score... and don't forget buckets of Sam Raimi style gore so critics think it's an art film (it's so violent, it must be important)! Still, nice photography by Kaminski and the opening bloodbath is effective though significantly overrated. As far as I'm concerned, Stevie peaked at ""Jaws"". Go see ""The Thin Red Line"" instead. It may be flawed and too slow for audiences who found ""The Matrix"" to be thrilling cinema but Compare Malick's believable portrayal of the confused Japanese soldiers (who by the way all behave differently to war's horrors and are individuals) with Stevie's portrayal of the Germans as evil double crossing villains not far removed from the kooky Nazis in his thrilling Indiana Jones trilogy. Unfortunately the world is more complex than as seen through the eyes of Spielberg or Frank Capra (although both excel at propaganda).  One of the most jingoistic widely acclaimed films in recent memory( and the seventh best film EVER according to the handy Internet Movie Database).",,Anonymous,Drama
Visually graphic and disturbing war epic.,"Saving Private Ryan is a WW2 film that begins on the Normandy beaches of France on D-day, June 6th, 1944. The first 20 minutes are the most intense and graphic depictions of war I have seen. The D-day beach assaults will never be recreated so elegantly ever again. The noise, carnage, and chaos overwhelms and deeply disturbs the viewer. Unlike anything I have ever seen.So far through the film you have been following Captain Miller(Tom Hanks) and his company on the beaches of Normandy. After the intense battle the US Army counts its dead. Three brothers were killed on that same day in Normandy. The 4th and youngest brother is James Francis Ryan(Matt Damon), and he is not reported dead but his whereabouts are unknown. Private Ryan is a paratrooper who jumped behind enemy lines as a paratrooper the night before the landings. He is the last of the sons that his mother still has. The army wants him found and brought back home to safety. Captain Miller is now given this task to find Private Ryan and bring him to safety.Captain Miller now travels across battle torn French country side to find Private Ryan. But he does not travel alone. He travels with seven of his own hand picked men from his company. On their journey they face hard struggles. The mission becomes deadly and now the question is why risk the lives of eight men to save the life of one? The men do finally find Private Ryan but Ryan does not want to abandon his fellow comrades who he has been fighting and holding out with. So now Captain Miller and his men stay with Ryan and the troops he has been fighting with in this bombed out town waiting to hold out until relief arrives. The Germans are advancing on the town with many more troops and with tanks. Captain Miller and the rest of the men are vastly outnumbered but are going to try to hold on. What develops is one of the most graphic and disturbing final stands I have ever seen in a war movie.Spielber masterfully directed the battle sequences. The battle scenes attacked your senses. The special effects were mind boggling to say the least. The scenes were so realistic and brutally graphic. So much blood and carnage that truly disturbs the viewer. War is shown as what it is. Nasty!!!!!!!!!The acting was very good all around except from I think Matt Damon. But Tom Hanks never ceases to amaze me as he turns out one great performance. The film also stars Tom Sizemoore and Edward Burns as part of the rescue mission. Throughout the film there are many great cameos from actors like Paul Giamatti and even Ted Danson. Overall the acting was very good.The dialog was for the most part realistic but at some parts not as much. Captain Miller's character seemed to know to much about all the other operations that were happening in France. And some of the lines, although not many, were a little cliché.I felt the film to be a little biased towards the Americans which I hate to see in movies. Spielberg seemed to convey the Germans as evil jerks. German soldiers were just like the American soldiers. There is a difference between the German Army and the Nazi SS. So I was ashamed to see the German soldiers representing evil. War should represent evil, not German soldiers. Both sides are committing unforgiving violence. Not just the Germans.Saving Privazte Ryan is a very good film. Everyone should at least experience it once, especially if you are a WW2 buff. Very educational! Not the best movie of all time but still very good.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Far More Than Just Another War Film,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is very rare to see a movie and truly be moved by it. From start to finish, you are so immersed in this film that you are feeling every emotion of every character as if you were them. The true underlying message is often hard for most people to pick out, but if you truly grasp what this movie is about, you will realize just how beautiful a movie can be.The audio in this movie and the gritty, unflinching realism grabs you and pulls you into the war that Spielberg has so incredibly painted on the screen. The opening scene of D-Day is perhaps the single most dramatic and immersive movie experience I have ever come across in my entire life.Unlike most films, every death you witness in this film stabs at your conscience. You truly feel the adrenaline of the killer, the pain of the soldier, and the sorrow of the soldier's friends every time someone dies.This is perhaps the greatest movie ever made, even beyond the war genre. Every piece of this masterpiece is a work of art. The terrifying and realistic sound effects, the emotional and beautiful soundtrack, and the flawless performance by the actors makes this movie unforgettable.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Unforgettable!,"I'm A huge War film buff, especially WW2 and this in my opinion is the best of them all.The thing that made this movie great for me was the realism and feelings for the characters. You actually feel for them, which IMO only a few war films seem to bring.The opening scene(Omaha Beach) I would rate up there as one of the greatest scenes in movie history!. The realism, the camera swaying all over the place going in and out of the water, the bullets whizzing past and the screaming. Its just bloody amazing and so full on that it can't be topped!.I have watched this movie countless times and it still never gets old to me.10/10 a memorable movie that is a must see",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Quite possibly the best WWII film ever,"Saving Private Ryan is quite possibly the best World War II-inspired movie ever.I know, it's not at all historically accurate. I know, there are plot points that don't make sense. I know and understand all these criticisms.As a film, however, and as a statement on what war is and how war affects people, this film is Top Notch and should have won the Best Picture Oscar the year it was released.This film has exciting, graphic, horrifying and realistic battle footage. The opening montage alone represents the best film-making possible regardless of technology.The cast is simply brilliant, not a lame or hackneyed performance in the bunch. Tom Hanks is again Oscar-worthy, and if they had an Oscar for Best Ensemble Cast this film would have won hands-down.This film is absolutely *nothing* like the cheesy WWII movies with John Wayne or Henry Fonda or Ernest Borgnine. This film is not all jingoistic patriotism, it is a real look at what real war is like, with heroic soldiers and cowardly soldiers and soldiers simply trying to do their jobs and survive. It shows the futility of war and the necessity of war. And it pulls no punches in showing the horrors of war.Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, terrifically written, truly an amazing piece of film-making.10 out of 10 for an inspiring film.Barky",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Glorious and nightmarish.,"Words cannot describe the greatness of this film. Hell, if I type a long review of this film, it might take away the film's credibility. So I'm gonna keep this review short, sweet and simple.ACTING: Superb. Likable characters and they put you, the audience, smack dab in the middle of the war. Tom Hanks is outstanding. Notable mention is Jeremy Davies who does a great job portraying the contrasting soldier, Upham.DIRECTION: Excellent. Frenetic camera movement, thrilling and extremely realistic action sequences. Spielberg is masterful, as always. He manages to show the audience how nightmarish war really is.STORY/SCREENPLAY: Storywise, it is uplifting and inspiring. And during historical moments, it is accurate and realistic. Screenplay slips into sentimental state during times, but we'd look over that.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Mesmerizing. At times we look at the horrors of war with the nightmarish (there goes that word again) display of a blood-drenched beach and war-torn cities. The color modification really helps the effectiveness of the cinematography.MUSIC: Is put into places where it should be. John Williams does a fantastic job once again.OVERALL: In short, definitely in my favorite movies list, and on the critical side, one of the greatest movies ever made. This film deserves to be owned and watched by film lovers.9.966/10Delton",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the best war films of all time.,"This is definetely one of my top ten. It includes a great cast, great action and a great story.

A Very Powerful. Moving and Brilliant piece of cinema,"Saving Private Ryan is probably on of the greatest war films ever made, along with Paths of Glory and Appocalypse Now.The way that Spielberg develops the characters throughout the film is very good. My Grand-Father along with many other people who fought in WW2 would say it is very very very realistic.Especially in the opening scene at the beaches and the final battle at the end.Tom hanks is brilliant in it as well as the rest of the cast, It's brilliantly shot and very very well made.It shows what the life was like for a WW2 soldier.And it shows the Absolute Hell of war and what is what like to be there.Many people would say they cried at the end, even men because it is just so moving to think how or why we do this and how could we have done this to each other, and Tom Hank's last words made it even more moving. It has Beautiful music and is a Gem of a film.I would definitely recommend it for 12 years and above, and it should be shown to every child out there to teach them the reality of war.If you haven't seen this already go and buy the DVD now! If there was a higher rating than 10 I would it a 100.Brilliant",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I felt used.,"I'm afraid that I hated every moment of this film. Spielburg overused emotional hokum to try to give his film wieght when we actually didn't care whether Private Ryan lived or died. The first twenty minutes, I accept are excellent, but they are just a rip off of someone else's hard work - and frankly I would rather see the original footage from the Second World War rather than the director's interpretation of it. Although it tried to be realistic and historical, it was neither. The history is faulty and the emotions of the rangers are not realistic. (I imagine that if it happened for real they would complain about having to rescue this mummie's boy and hide out somewhere safe until it was safe to go back to base.) I'd rather watch the notoriously bad, Objective Burma anyday. At least it doesn't pretend to be true.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Think What You May But Please Don't Miss THE Message,"It really does not matter what one thinks of this film as long as they catch the underlying message. Anyone who has been involved in combat or survived a catastrophe can relate to it. Having no psychological training, I refer to it as the 'Why Me' syndrome. The first and last 5 minutes along with one line towards the end of the movie depict the message's fullest impact on a person relate to it. Having been in NYC when the World Trade Center was hit, I do not doubt many who survived that catastrophe have similar feelings. What is it? It is the guilt, the sense of embarrassment, the confusion, the internal turmoil and the many unanswered questions associated with surviving such an event when so many you consider better or more deserving than you did not. Private Ryan in his later years experiences this in its fullest during the first and last five minutes of the movie. Tom Hanks dying words 'Earn this.' were said for those who never experienced such events. Those who have do not have to be reminded. There are a great many other messages that the uninitiated could pick up.If you ever wondered why your father, grandfather husband or more recently wife are the way they are or 'changed' after such an experience this is most likely why. When the World War II vets came home they were heroes. When the Korean War vets came home they came home. When the Vietnam vets came home However, although how they were treated after they came home had an impact on their psyche, what they experienced while they were 'there' left an indelible mark they will never be able to erase. These experiences come to mind while daydreaming, they hit you like a punch when they pop into your mind when concentrating on something totally unrelated and regardless of how long ago it happened one can not control their dreams. All I ask is that regardless of what you think of our involvement in Iraq, those who were there did not make our foreign policy. Believe me, if they had their choice virtually all of them would have rather been somewhere else. Just try to remember what they have been through and that they will relive those experiences for the rest of their lives.",,Anonymous,Drama
A necessary nightmare,"Magnificient. Simply. And horrible, even if a movie, so close to the hell it was on these days, is not close enough to what simple young men had to suffer. A great feeling of despair and the question : why should they have to get killed? at the end of the movie. Because, in a nightmare like this, there is no good purpose to die for, even for their country, as some generals, the ass in their office, would explain.The friendship those guys shared was beyond brotherhood in this time. think about those who died. those who suffered.but, more than anything, to those who survived and make us live. Soldiers who died deserve more than respect. They deserve a think sometimes, a sincere tear on their graves, not for what they won but for what they suffer, and they deserve a smile.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A war movie which in fact is poetry,"I usually watch and give credit to European movies and usually hate the Hollywood production. And I usually see a political statement in ""Schindlers list"" which is commonly quoted as ""his best movie"" and ""the best movie about holocaust"".However... after seeing S.P.R. I must agree that this is, if probably not the ""best movie ever made"", the most ""revolutionary war movie of all time"".The movie structure is like a poem. It shakes you in the beginning, it calms you in the middle and it destroys you in the end verses.First of all... the first battle on Omaha beach... the moving camera... the embed-ed reporter like camera... following the soldiers to the beach... the explosions, arms, legs torn apart, the fear on soldiers faces... the numbness... the on-and-off going sound after the bombs go off... MAN! After seeing it for the first time... I went out of the movie theater... and went to see it again for the second time! There has never been a movie that glued me to the chair... and made me stare for 25 minutes in silence! Well, that was a... romantic experience and I give Spielberg credit for that.The middle of the movie... is exactly the opposite of the first. It's not loud and disturbing... but silent and green. I must say it's the greenest grass I have seen in a war movie... the soldiers walk and walk and speak about stupid stuff... like they never went thru hell in the landing at Omaha beach. When I watched this middle section I almost felt good, but it felt very unnatural... and that's why after the assault on the MG-42 nest... I felt shaken again. The dying red cross soldier shot in the stomach... dying... in the arms of comrades... UFFF. Some disturbing images.And of course... the last part... the total destruction, the panzer's rolling thru the streets, the sniper... the self-made sticky bombs... the ruble of houses, the fights one on one... wow. Some serious sequences...I admired the photography, the clean pictures, however it is the moving camera that makes this movie revolutionary... I think no director is able to make again a credible war movie without the Spielberg's moving camera... and that's why I consider him a GENIUS. I haven't seen a war movie with static cameras after S.P.R came out.I must say that this movie can be judged in many ways... you can always see a ""shallow characterization"" or even a demagogic view on the Jew-German combat in the house... of course. However... if I exclude my political view of this movie I would say that this is probably one of the best I have ever seen.Only the Russian movie ""Come and See"" (orig. Idi i Smotri) made even a harder impact on my view on what war is. And that's why I consider Saving Private Ryan if not the best, then second best war movie ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Spielberg's best,"This is a war movie that is so horrifying and moving that it can't be anything else than the best.Everything is great about this movie, great actors, great battle sequences and a good ending.

A brutally realistic and emotionally powerful depiction of war,"I've seen my fair share of war films, but it's really surprising that I've waited this long to finally see (in full) what is probably the greatest WWII film ever made. There's probably no amount of words that I could write that would do justice to what I feel like having seen this for the first time. The only thing I regret is not having seen it on a bigger screen (although, to be fair, I was 9 years old when this first came out).The plot, as if anyone didn't know it by now, is that an Army captain (Tom Hanks) who just landed at Normandy Beach is charged with retrieving a Private Ryan, the last surviving of his mother's sons, and returning him safely home. Of course, as all of the characters point out several times throughout the film, they run into a lot of FUBAR (Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition) situations. And if there's one truth that this film gets at, it's that war is ugly (original, I know right?). Still, the call of duty is just as important to every single one of these men as is their devotion to each other. They face a lot of moral quandaries, and even make some questionable decisions, but when it all comes down they have each others' backs and the knowledge that completion of the mission will earn them the right to go home. I can't really think of a stronger motivation than that.Another thing which this film does right is with its selection of story, which also plays into the human element. The mission isn't to take a hill or some other landmark: it's to rescue someone. Using WWII as a setting for this story allows the average person to really connect with it on a deeper level than if it had just been a typical war film with a large ensemble cast. And by the way, the cast in this movie is pretty insane. Granted, there are many films before it (THE LONGEST DAY is one example that comes to mind) that did the same thing, but the attention to character in this one sets it apart from the rest. There are elements of cliché, but every main character is fully fleshed out.This film is also extraordinary for its cinematographic approach. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski utilized a hand-held style which puts you into the thick of the action and aptly portrays the chaos and confusion inherent in those situations. This is also enhanced by a gritty look partially achieved by shooting on film. Last, but not least, there is an emotionally resonant score by John Williams which punctuates the story at all the right moments yet is never intrusive or overbearing. I also appreciated the diegetic use of the Edith Piaf song, ""Tu es partout"" before a climactic scene, and which conveys to the audience the feelings of the people these men left behind in service to their country (even though it's a song about love lost, and to be sure there were plenty of people who never came back).Overall every single one of these elements, including some I haven't mentioned, combine to create a brutally realistic and emotionally powerful depiction of war, the heights of which has been reached by few. And not just that, it managed to do all of this without leaning too far in the direction of being pro- or anti-war. It presents it as is, the good with the bad, and doesn't demonize the enemy as so many films are apt to do. Hopefully this hasn't been too long-winded, but this is an incredible film that deserves to be seen by everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A 1940's War Movie Without the Hays Code Restrictions,"We saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" as a family. My husband, who watches the War Channels constantly to the extent that I walk by teasing him that I'll let him know the end - ""The Germans lose!"", thought it was a fresh spin on traditional war movies by showing the doubts of the soldiers.I thought it was just a color WWII movie as young 'uns refuse to see black and white movies these days. I could match that this actor was playing the William Bendix role, this one John Garfield's, this one Robert Ryan's, this one Montgomery Clift, etc.Those movies were restricted by the Hays Code and the need to spur war time spirit that they couldn't show doubts, though I remember some revisionist movies made after about the impact on Berlin, another with Robert Taylor vs. the Japanese on some island. Or even Bridge on the River Kwai. So they weren't all jingoistic.I walked out of ""Ryan"" saying ""Gee, war is hell.""Edward Burns was excellent.The cinematography was terrific and compelling.(originally written 8/26/1998)",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

The film is like a roller coaster of emotion and terror. Filmed up close and with the cast in every sense it was emotionally draining. I have since bought the dvd and seen it many times. I cannot fault it. I have also been to the D-day beaches, read the Ambrose books and visited the grave yards including the one in the film. It is exactly like it.It is hard to say what is my favourite scene but the sniper shooting the german in the church tower is brilliant and perfectly done.I've had enough of war films that show people getting shot and falling gracefully to the ground, in SPR they show it how it is, ugly and very cruel. If you want proof see the news clip of the Yanks executing the young vietnamese boys in the street. SPR brilliant.",,Anonymous,Drama
Best D-Day scene ever,"Saving Private Ryan rekindled an interest in the media about the Second World War, with the TV Series Band of Brothers, films ranging from the Great Raid to Enemy at the Gate to Pearl Harbor and computer games like the Medal of Honour and Call of Duty series. Saving Private Ryan is also noted for its use of realistic of violence and war combat, which has continued into further films and television programmes.Set during the early days of the invasion of Europe by the Allied troops, a platoon of American soldiers led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is assigned to find Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), an soldier who 3 brothers are killed in action. He has a ticket home. The mission sounds simple enough, but Ryan was in the 101th Airborne and dropped behind enemy lines before D-Day. Miller's Platoon has to go through enemy territory to find one man. The platoon who are assigned with Miller start to question the mission, especially when their men start dying.The war scene, especially the D-Day scene are some of the best committed to film. It shows that war was very brutal, very bloody, confusing and the need for good tactics and good men. The film makes an effort to show a mixed picture, that the Germans were a soldiers, not monsters or all Nazis, whilst some Americans can be arrogant and even committed war crimes, like killing surrendering soldiers. It is so much better compared to a one-dimensional film like Braveheart. Spielberg is a great director, and avoids shooting the film in a ordinary way. He uses a hand-held style, and his cinematographer Janusz Kamiński films in a washed out look, giving the film a documentary, gritty feel. He knows how to make a film visually wonderful. They is an excellent cast, Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon in leading roles, whilst even small roles were filled by established actors like Ted Danson and Paul Giamatti. Tom Hanks is the most well developed character, making you care about what happens to him and what drives him throughout the film. Many of the characters have backstorys like Private Ryan or character traits like the arrogant Jew or the sniper who was a committed Catholic.There are however problems with this film. The script and story are weak. They are character clichés like the wimp, the ultra good officer who is committed to the mission, the brave soldier, etc.... On the other side of the coin some characters simply disappeared off the screen because you couldn't care about them. The story is also ridiculous; could you really picture the American military risking a whole platoon to save one man, a private, a farm boy from Iowa? Especially with him being in the middle of enemy territory and not knowing where he was, not fighting on the frontline. It's hard to suspend your disbelief. The film is also a normal piece of American Patriotism, showing how great their were. I know it's an American story, but it ignores some of the darker elements which other writers and directors would have focused on, mainly non-American filmmakers. They was no mention of the British or Canadian forces fighting, and even Robert Rodat writes a line which pretty much an attack on Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, a British war hero. Rodat must have some issues with the British because he also wrote the really awful The Patriot. Saving Private Ryan also has the same problem that Gladiator has, that it's opening is so good that nothing else in the film can compare to it.Saving Private Ryan is a example of a director improving on the script he is given. Worth watching, a good Oscar win for Spielberg, but The Thin Red Line should have won Best Picture in 1998, over Saving Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"All I can say is ""WOW""!","I've read several comments and many people seem to agree that this movie is extremely patriotic.  I for one think that there is nothing patriotic about this movie, it simply shows a group of soldiers (that happen to be american ), on a mission of looking for a single soldier whose brothers have been killed in action.  I personally have no doubt in my mind that had this movie been based on a French, British or even Canadian squad, that not to many people would have been calling it patriotic.  For some reason the site of an american flag at the beginning and at the end of the film seems to make people think much less of the movie. I am not american myself but I sure as hell am glad they got into the war and all though there were many other countries in the war, this movie happened to be about an american squad.

One of the best portrayals of war,"The plot of this movie was based on fact, which means that the actual events that are depicted in the movie may not have happened exactly as portrayed, but represent real events that did take place. If many who saw this film complain about the lack of historical basis, lack of minorities, lack of whatever, then get over it. Some events took place in World War II that did not actually include members of all races or nations. As for those who say the film is boring, then I can only suppose that real life situations don't hold much appeal for you. If you're that disconnected from the real world, go back to your video game.World War II was a very grim time in the history of our civilization, and it would be difficult to find anyone who actually participated in battle during this period to disagree with me. I've known many soldiers, and I've never met one that wished for the awful, bloody, sickening carnage that is combat, especially the all-or-nothing circumstances that were all to real in this world between 1939 and 1945. Soldiers are simply people who are willing to fight for their country. In World War II, many of the American combatants were drafted, and some did refuse to fight, as is the case in any war, but most served, with or without distinction or recognition, but did what they felt was their duty. Infantry soldiers, even Ranger captains like John Miller were often ordinary people very much removed from the lives they wanted to be living. Every country that participated in World War II lost many John Millers, decent, ordinary people that were just doing their duty to the best of their ability.For those who complain about the stark portrayal of combat as being too brutal, I suggest you just live in your dream world where when a steel projectile strikes human flesh, the body just simply falls to the ground. You are living in a dream world to think this is so. Combat invariably involves gruesome situations. Body parts are blown away, blood and gore flies. ""War is Hell"" is not just a saying; it's the absolute truth.Saving Private Ryan depicts combat with more accuracy than most war films in the past have done. Watching this film will put the average person much closer to the actual feeling of being in combat than almost anything else.As for those that hate to be reminded of accurate depictions of history, there is a saying: Those who ignore history will repeat it. This movie, and the war it depicts hopefully have taught us some valuable lessons. I hope we never forget them.If you're offended by a movie that shows the American flag, then don't watch it. The realistic depiction of the USA as a patriotic nation in the 1940's might be a little too much for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The total and utter silence during the entire film except for the ending where quiet sobbing could be heard gives testament to the powerful imagery concocted by Spielberg.Having watched the opening beach scene being filmed in Ireland, I had no idea how dramatic it would appear on the screen.

A movie you won't remember tomorrow...,"This is another movie in the long list of overrated movies here in IMDB. You know, war has always been a favorite subject for movies, because it generates intense emotions. These emotions are there de facto: Just imagine a seriously wounded soldier, screaming, covered in blood, surrounded by fellow soldiers with pain on their faces. You see, it can't be too difficult to generate emotions when the subject is war. And so does this movie, but not in any particularly original way. The most serious problem of this movie is its storyline, which you know from start to end if you read the following sentence: ""A soldier has lost his 3 brothers in the war, and so we must find him and save him to soothe his poor mother"". That's all folks. The rest is the typical adventures you would expect from a war movie. The same predictable results, the occasional conflict between members of the rescue team, and so on. We have seen all of this, and much better. The only reason this movie will get a 6 out of 10, is the very good (as usual) Tom Hanks. All in all, a great movie to see if you want to forget it in the next 10 minutes after ""The End"".",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

A daily comment from Midget Emma: Saving Private Ryan (1998),"The best and most powerful war movie ever.Its been hailed as the best and most realistic war movie ever and it is.Thinking that war was this horrifying is unbelievable but it was like this and Saving Private Ryan shows it in every detail. This is one movie i would recommend for parents to show their kids. Kids need to know what war was really like. Instead of watching war movies where they portray it as bullet dodging - jumping through explosions fun. Overlooking the gore i think kids should watch it to understand and appreciate the war veterans more. It sure made me appreciate them more.The opening scene is one you will never forget. I am referring to the Ohama beach scene of course,which is the most powerful scene in the movie although it is the most graphic it still is a strong scene.After a mother loses all her sons except one. Eight men go behind enemy lines to save him and bring him back home to his mother. Guided by Captain John Miller the men journey into the heart of war and make it their mission to bring private Ryan home to his mother.Every actor did a great job. I was greatly surprised by Vin Diesal he did a nice performance. Tom Hanks was excellent and Matt Damon was good as private Ryan.I recommend this to everyone and i mean everyone if you don't have this movie i would run out and borrow it.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Work of Art,"In Hollywood war film tradition, epic warfare orbits on the actions of already acquainted heroes. In Steven Spielberg's judicial and exacting masterwork, thousands of horror-struck and nauseated men, most of them green to battle, are chucked into the grimace of devastating German fire. The opening sequence is as detailed as any war footage. In the blood-soaked opening steps, the landing forces and the enemy never connect eye to eye, but are just faceless clots of men who have been commanded to shoot at one another until one side is overwhelmed.Spielberg's camera makes no comprehension of the engagement. That is the function of his approach. For the individual soldier on the beach, the landing was a cacophony of clamor, sludge, gore, entrails and morbidity. The scene is filled with various nongermane fragments of chronology, as when a soldier has his arm blown off.This landing sequence is essential to form the remoteness between those who give the order that Pvt. Ryan be saved, and those who are dictated to do the saving. For Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men, the landing at Omaha has been a melting pot of crossfire. For the Army Chief in his Washington office, war feels more secluded and nationalistic. His advisors doubt the judgment and even the plausibility of a mission to save Ryan. That sets up the second act of the film, in which Miller and his men infiltrate spryly inflamed French terrain, while entertaining defiant ideas about the prudence of the assignment. All of Miller's men have served with him before, save for Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies), the translator, who speaks excellent German and French but has never fired a rifle in rage and is frightened nearly to the point of his morality's deterioration. The war was fought by civilians just like him, whose lives had not readied them for the brass tacks of combat.Steven Spielberg is often thought of as a throwaway name to refer to when speaking of the greatest directors of all time, mainly because his movies are often romanticized, Hollywood blockbusters and not hard, tough, cool grungy stuff. Spielberg, while he demonstrates a mastery of pace and story crescendo that should be taught in every film school in the world, proves with Saving Private Ryan, not to mention with the more recent Munich, that he is capable of true grit and shocking realism.The story begins with the most gut-wrenchingly violent battle scene I've seen in any war film. This prolonged sequence depicts D-Day in the most realistic possible way, not only with gore and violence but also with the ambient violence that must be dealt with in moments of hasty contemplation and desperate but emotionally diluted dialogue. The film then segues into a story that applies the deeply affecting theme of the mother. What makes the film so profound is its core drawing of sympathy from the audience for the common boy's mother and the pain and worry they endure in times of war that we can only imagine.His cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, who also shot Schindler's List, brings a newsreel texture to a lot of the footage, but that's rather elementary next to his most substantial stroke, which is to make everything manifest lucid. Following the meticulous pandemonium of the landing scenes, Kaminski handles the attack on the machine gun nest, and an extensive climax concerning the fortification of a bridge, in a way that keeps us aligned. It's not simply men shooting at one another. We learn the plan of the action, the subtle victory of optimism over despair, the spontaneity, the corresponding locations of the soldiers.Hanks has a subtle sense of drama in his personal commitment to the role of Capt. Miller, an English teacher who has outlived ordeals so overwhelming that he doubts if his wife will even place him. With a reserved, collected, and even exacting bearing, his hands nonetheless quiver. He is on the verge of breakdown, but he does his best since that is his duty. All of the actors, all the countless noteworthy faces, playing the men under him are compelling, somewhat on account of Spielberg defying the inducement to make them stereotypical caricatures in the custom of WWII movies, and makes them emphatically everyday.Everything approaches the third act, when Private Ryan is found, and the soldiers determine what to do next. Spielberg and his screenwriter, Robert Rodat, have done a penetrating and personally transcendent thing: They have made a philosophical film about war in effect thoroughly in circumstances of action. Their sweeping ode says things about war that are as intricate and demanding as any essayist could likely assert, and does it with expansive, forceful imagery, with brutality, with coarseness, with movement, with rapport. It is conceivable to get across even the most sensitive notions in the most elementary words and actions, and that's what Spielberg does with keen instincts, because he signifies his impressions in visceral reactions, not words. Steven Spielberg is as technically accomplished as any filmmaker alive, and due to his mammoth eminence, he has admittance to any asset he entails. Both of those facts are relevant to the punch of this seamless period piece. He knows how to express his emotional fervor about men in combat with utmost moralistic intensity, and he has the apparatus, the greenback and the running dogs to make it happen.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the greatest war movies ever made,"Normandy, 6 June, 1944. The Allied invasion to liberate Europe from the Germans has begun. Captain Miller is the commander of a Ranger company on Omaha beach. He and his men undergo a harrowing ordeal on D-Day before taking their objective. Days later they are given another mission: save Private Ryan. Private James Ryan, a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division, is somewhere in the interior of Normandy and the US high command want him found and brought back safely. In the last week three of his brothers have been killed and he is the sole surviving son in the family.Incredible movie by Steven Spielberg. As a war movie it is the most realistic and gritty movie you'll ever see. The Omaha Beach scenes are the most accurate and graphic depiction of battle ever committed to celluloid. Militarily correct in every way.Great plot, with a great message. Very emotional at the end.Great work by Tom Hanks as Captain Miller. Good support from Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Ed Burns, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Jeremy Davies. Ted Danson, Dennis Farina and Dale Dye appear in minor roles. Even has some big names in pre-star days: Vin Diesel, Bryan Cranston, Nathan Fillion, Paul Giamatti.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Not the best war film ever made, but perhaps the most realistic.","What Steven Spielberg has done with ""Saving Private Ryan"" is simultaneously craft an enormously successful depiction of World War II, and a touching story that places a platoon of bewildered soldiers in a world of frantic pacing -- a startling world of gunfire and proceeding death. The constant movement of the shaky hand-held camera acts as a first person perspective -- we are not merely viewing the movie, but participating in it. This is perhaps as close as we will ever get to realizing the unadulterated fear those soldiers must have felt as they drew nearer to the beaches of France. It is one of the greatest war films ever put on celluloid, its scope arguably larger than any other in the genre, its conflict superb.The movie, based on the actual events surrounding the Nilan brothers during World War II, is about a group of soldiers sent to rescue Private Ryan (Matt Damon), a young man who loses three brothers in the war, and whose mother is spared the possible chance of losing her remaining son after Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and his platoon are sent on a dangerous mission to find, and return, Private Ryan to safety.The men who fight alongside Miller have to question their own actions. What makes Private Ryan more important than any of them? They all have mothers, too. But they follow orders, venturing into the battlefields of WWII France in search of Private Ryan. The most reluctant of the soldiers is Private Reiben (Edward Burns), a pessimistic everyman who feels no need to risk his own life for that of another man.The battle scenes are ultimately what made ""Saving Private Ryan"" one of the highest-grossing films of the decade, and what enticed so many eager viewers into theaters. Many veterans of the war reportedly broke down in tears during one of the first sequences, the landing at Omaha Beach, which probably lasts about fifteen minutes -- at least.However, the movie also reaches a sort of emotional height that few other war films manage to capture. This is a fascinating account of war, packed with terrifyingly realistic scenes and some of the most disturbing images you will ever see in a mainstream film, but it also has a lot to say about friendship and selfless motivations. ""Earn this,"" Captain Miller tells Private Ryan at one point in the film.Spielberg has proved countless times that he is capable of abandoning his famously schmaltzy style of film-making to record touching stories that often times relate to his own life. Spielberg claims that he felt an internal desire to tackle this project, as much as he felt it was necessary to direct ""Schindler's List."" Both films work as a sort of documentary-style motion picture, but also contain fundamental emotional truths, which elevate them to higher ground.Tom Hanks, as Captain Miller, is not the first actor who comes to mind when one thinks of war picture, but Hanks' position in the film works (to great effect) primarily because he personifies the everyman quality of a soldier. As we too often forget, the men who fight wars are not always the Schwarzeneggers with huge muscles and a wealth of weapons and ammunition. The soldiers in World War II were fathers, husbands, brothers, sons. Hanks successfully embodies the image of a simple man who is thrust into a world war and tries his best to stay alive.Is ""Saving Private Ryan"" a better movie than ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Platoon,"" or other great war pictures in the genre? Not necessarily. But it stands on its own as an amazing achievement of pure film-making, and an ode to the thousands of men who lost their lives for the campaign against Hitler's armies. If you can stomach the violence and accurate depictions of brutal warfare, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the most moving cinematic experiences you will ever have.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"An utter masterpiece of visuals and sound, resulting in one of the most immersive war experiences ever created","The 90s is arguably the greatest decade for master filmmaker Steven Spielberg, with possibly his three greatest films emerging from this era. Saving Private Ryan is one of these three films, and once more shows Spielberg's versatility as a director.Saving Private Ryan consists mostly of a constant use of Steadicam shots, which is these days often confused with 'Shakycam'. When comparing Saving Private Ryan's camera movements to those of the modern action movies of today, what stands out is that it is seemingly only used to heighten the immersion of the scene ( Unlike shakycam ). For example, if there is an explosion, the camera will often move with the tremor of this, and the same is true for heavy gunfire. All of this makes the audience seemingly 'present' in the inhuman war setting that is displayed, and the result is that SPR is undeniably one of the most realistic and immersive war films ever created. This is why, even though the camera is shaking a lot, the situation is still clear, and the audience doesn't miss a whole lot in the overview of the battles. SPR utilizes a lot of long takes that frequently differ from being a complete wideshot to a medium or a close-up, which creates a great variety in shot compositions, and the long takes ofcourse significantly increase the immersion, as every little detail and every piece of movement is there in a single shot, while not having to adjust to the new image of an edit.Yet SPR is not just a constant stream of chaos, as there are also many reflecting scenes between the lines. Many of these 'calm' moments between battle sequences such as the conversations at night in the church, the discussions right before the final battle, Tom Hanks's speech after the bunker attack about his prior job result in a lot of fantastic characterization. All of these conversations will significantly enhance the audience's connection with these characters, as every one of the main characters in the SPR squad is fleshed out and developed, with all of them having defining traits, such as Miller's shaking hands, or Jackson's kissing of the cross. Thus a lot of reason is given to care for the fates of these characters, which ofcourse heightens the emotional core of this film to a high degree.Tom Hanks is, as usual, once again Brilliant as Captain Miller, from the slow motion reflection scenes during battles to his conversations between them, his acting is top notch and once again proves his versatility as an actor, since he has played roles varying from a very low IQ individual, a loner on an Island & a mobster with a lot of conviction. Be it Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Matt Damon or Edward Burns, there is not a single unconvincing acting performance in the film. The dialogue is ofcourse also a fantastic addition ( Particularly the Lincoln quote ) to a good script. John Williams's score is superb, and is one of the most American sounding scores ever created for a film, which makes you wonder if any other movie score could ever be more fitting to the subject in question.With all its technical marvels in the use of the camerawork, there is also a fantastic use of sound, and the battle sequences always feature bombastic sound effects which are usually pitched higher than conversations to truly make the audience hear the terror of WWII. The sound of bombs or gunfire is as terrifying as possibly in SPR, which truly makes the audience feel as if they were there with the characters. Even after all this mayhem, the film still feels as if you are going through Hell, which is ofcourse an extraordinary feat for a film so heavily reliant on extended battle sequences.Saving Private Ryan is a rare example of an action filled anti-war statement, and Spielberg's impeccable direction allows the audience to live and breathe the experience of it, all the while there is also a lot of characterization going on that makes the audience care significantly about what happens to the main characters.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Great Movie from a Great Moviemaker,"great movie.. from a great director but what else is new? I really like the movie and I will tell you why but let me first quote the even greater Charles Bukowski: ""You begin saving the world by saving one man at a time; all else is grandiose romantism or politics."" well lets emphasis on the romantism because romantism is the genre of this movie. why? What do the soldiers represent in the war - the simple man. The simple man in extraordinary circumstances - romantism, a genre in Literature. The war is the extraordinary circumstance and the ""one man at a time"" is private Ryan. Now most of the negativism about the movie comes from the grandiose story but Spielberg presents the story with historical facts so the film doesn't feel too distant or too Hollywood. The Camera follows the actors in the sand and the piles of dead bodies. We see guts, blood, limbs. We see from their point of view while the battle unfolds. Spielberg has always had ""an eye"" for the photography but here he puts it to the limit. His vision is undeniable because its personal and because its a movie, it brings out a world before the viewers eyes and they cant judge the characters who by the way are perfectly created by the actors, Tom Hanks in a blowing-our-minds-of-performance, because its an extraordinary circumstance in which the simple man tries to figure out a way to survive or to do the right thing.In the end the old Ryan ask if he has lived a good life, if he is a good person, if he has earned it as Capt. Miller aka Tom Hanks told him before he died. In a way the movie is philosophical but I think that it is more like a book, you read it and think about it - what it means and what it is about, in contexts means, because its a great movie, it does what a great movie does - says what it suppose to say.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great,"Well...as a girl i thought that as a war movie i would HATE Saving Private Ryan, however, it ended up being a very gripping and powerful movie. The cast, the directing, and everything is just amazing and o my gosh i love all the actors in it. Edward Burns and Tom Sizemore are my favorites personally bet the entire cast really went well together. It was jipped when it didn't win the best picture Oscar for 1998. I mean Shakespeare in Love is a great movie, but I think that the patriotism exemplified in Saving Private Ryan is far more worthy of an Oscar than a romance film. This is a great movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who can handle violence and would like to see war portrayed in its most realistic form.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
4 stars for realism,"I have read several critiques of this movie claiming that the opening sequence and continuing doctrine are ""unrealistic"". These ""Experts"" claim that the opening scene is far too bloody and doesn't accurately describe what the fighting would have been like, and that the standard operating procedures of the squad are ""Hollywood"".I challenge these ""experts"" to put aside their ideology and bias and look at how a military operation actually works and what is involved.The Normandy invasion was the largest movement of troops and personal in the history of the world, and that mere accomplishment stands with the building of the Pyramids or the Hanging Gardens. It was a classic case of ""being willing to pay the butcher's bill"" for a victory. Saying that there were only 10% casualties is accurate, but it is an insult to the bravery of the 34,250 men that landed on the most heavily fortified real estate in the world. And especially to those going in the first wave, where casualties were known to be the highest (in some cases over 80%). 34,250 men don't all step off onto the beach at the same time.""Saving Private Ryan"" opens with the first wave of troop carriers going on to Omaha Beach. The defenders are there waiting for them, and therefore the casualty rates among these units will be high. The opening scene accurately describes this. My grandfather was part of the second wave onto Omaha and his eyewitness testimony confirms this.The breakdown of US casualties was 1465 dead, 3184 wounded, 1928 missing (presumed dead) and 26 captured. In the Annals of American History, only Antietam ranks higher in American casualties suffered in a single day.Several Airborne Rangers I've interviewed (including my father & grandfather) remark on the realism of the squad's interaction. These were not people sneaking through a jungle afraid of being ambushed, these were men that knew that surrounding territory was largely abandoned or populated by French that are hoping to be liberated. Virtually any patrol they encounter would be mechanized and be audible miles away.As for being able to ""pick up a radio and contact Ryan's unit to get him out"", units in World War II were often out of radio contact for days, occasionally weeks, at a time and had to operate autonomously. There were no GPS satellites and no cell phones. Many soldiers didn't understand French or German. Getting lost was common and a wrong turn would mean hours of delay and confusion. While I can't say the mission made a lot of sense to me from a military point of view, once the mission was ordered this was about the only way it could have been carried out.And yes, rank insignia was displayed (in muted color) on helmets of officers, just as it is today.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Shakespeare in Love doesn't even begin to compare,"I was physically sickened when I witnessed the outcome of the Oscars this evening. When Steven Spielberg won Best Director honors, I was immensely pleased. I thought that Saving Private Ryan, the best film of 1998, and the best war film ever would surely take Best Picture honors. However, when Harrison Ford announced that Shakespeare in Love was Best Picture, I was on the verge of vomiting. While Shakespeare in Love may have been a decent film, it was resoundingly light, fluffy fare that didn't deserve to win Best Actress (that should have gone to Cate Blanchett), nor Best Picture.Now that I've put Shakespeare in Love down enough (not entirely enough, but as much as possible right now), I want to write about the virtues of Saving Private Ryan. When I first saw this movie, I was amazed at every single element. Nothing was flawed in this film. The sound was amazing, as was the cinematography, the editing, the screenplay, the incredibly subdued performance of Tom Hanks, and the tremendous supporting cast. With the bookends of the two extraordinary battles, and the framing sequences that mean say so very much about the meaning and loss in war with so few words, Saving Private Ryan was obviously both the best film of 1998, and the best film about war ever filmed. Because of this, it will be remembered long after Shakespeare in Love goes the way of Tom Jones, The Life of Emile Zola, and all of those other forgettable Best Pictures that have come before. Steven Spielberg did a great service to WWII veterans, and the movie-going public with this film, and I hope that it's remembered for much longer than the light, meaningless Shakespeare in Love.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A great war epic!,"September 18, 1998 (The day i saw this movie)Throughout the years,there have been war movies that brought back horrendous memories to veterans who fought in war; to movie buffs it showed how war can tear up an individual or showed why it was worth fighting for. In Steven Spielberg's war drama, it is not a division between what's good and bad, but to show homage to those who fought in the biggest war of the 20th century.The first 20 minutes of the prologue is one of the most gruesome battle scenes I've ever watched on screen. We see the boats boarding up soldiers as they are heading to the murky beaches of Normandy June 6, 1942, which will be remember to most people as the worst battle in history. Tom Hanks plays Capt. John Miller, who leads his squad in the terror battle and tries to find his team into the breach as hundreds of soldiers die. As realistic as it is, we see the carnage of soldiers getting ripped in pieces, crying for their mothers, and in one scene we see a man looking for his amputated arm.After the grizzly attack on the beach, Miller has been ordered another mission; a manhunt for the lost of one soldier after losing three of his brothers at Normandy, and throughout the film we get to see some of the most realistic battles since ""Platoon,"" where the violence and gore plays an important part of the realism; but also get a chance to see to recognize the characters during the non-violent parts which reminded audiences members of how these soldiers were like a family.""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the best war flicks I have ever seen on the screen. With a great all star cast from Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Matt Damon, Vin Diseal, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Rebisi, Paul Giamatti and more. This is one of Steven Spielberg's greatest work ever made",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Well-executed movie but the point is unclear,"Saving Private Ryan is well-filmed and well-acted. But it is thematically a mess, and on that count is wildly overrated.The complaints about this movie on these IMDb comments are two: one that it is properly speaking an anti-war film, and the other that it indulges in crude nationalism. Both complaints are on the mark, but it should be noticed that they are not quite consistent with one another. Saving Private Ryan, in the tradition of Vietnam movies like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, focuses on the human cost of war. But its moral, that we must earn the sacrifice those bold men made for us so long ago, sits rather uncomfortably with the focus on the cost. After all, how could we earn the loss of these men and the grief of their mothers? By living well? By being good people? It doesn't make sense. How could you make your life worth the sacrifice of so many others?Perhaps the point is that we ought to be grateful to the men who fought and died for saving our lives. But this doesn't make sense either. The war in Europe did not properly speaking save our lives. Wars are rarely if ever fought to save lives. They are fought to conquer and to defend against being conquered. But being conquered does not amount to being killed, and it might well save lives to surrender. Spielberg does obliquely refer to the Holocaust in the film. But he must know as everyone does that the war was not fought to end the Holocaust.Perhaps Spielberg is tacitly assuming some flag-waving boilerplate about how they fought 'for freedom', and we ought to be grateful for that. I don't deny that 'saving Europe for liberal democracy'however we understand that--was a noble cause. But it would be impossible to tell from this movie that this was the point of the war, and it might well be impossible to believe that such a cause was worth dying for once you had properly taken in its message: that war is the senseless destruction of mothers' sons.War movies traditionally fall into two types. One type focuses on the heroic cause the soldiers fought for, in which case you will want to glorify war. You will want to make your soldiers look strong, noble, and make our hearts melt with admiration for them. Otherwise how can we encourage others to fight for such (often abstract) causes? Most classic WWII movies fit this mold. And given that most of us think WWII was fought for a good cause, this makes sense. The other alternative is to focus on the human cost of war, as Vietnam movies and WWI movies typically do. But it isn't a coincidence that Vietnam and WWI are thought to be pointless wars. The idea of such movies is that nationalism and social habits can lead us to sacrifice our children for nothing. By shocking us with the horror of war, we are encouraged to mistrust martial impulses.Saving Private Ryan tries to take from both traditions, and ends up with a garbled mess. WWII was a noble cause that could not have been worth the sacrifice.It might be argued that each type of movie neglects some important truth that the other type captures. Perhaps some great filmmaker will successfully ennoble the causes of war and at the same time capture its horror. Perhaps someone already has. All I know is that Spielberg has not.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

outstanding,"The American army are about to land at the Omaha beach in France. The moment they land its a blood soaked fight to take the beach. In this fight is Captain Miller and his troop of men. After the Omaha assault, Miller is given a mission to find a man and take him out from behind enemy lines. The man is Private James Ryan. Ryan's brothers have been killed in action and to bereave his mother the American Army want him home. Ryan's location is unknown as his paratroop were miss dropped. Miller and his troop now have to go behind enemy lines to find Ryan, that is if he's still alive.Saving Private Ryan is an outstanding war drama from master director Steven Spielberg. The opening beach scene is so brutally violent and harshly real, yet it honestly conveys the horror of the war. This was the first movie I saw that violent, but accurately, portrayed the violent nature of war and the emotions of the soldiers. You are placed right into the battle; with people being dismembered and shot apart. The final fight at the bridge crossing is the most intense battle of the film. It doesn't have the sheer unrelenting violence of the opening battle, but it is so emotionally charged.Though the violence is confronting, but there is so much drama and character depth behind the violence. All the people of Millers troop are three dimensional, you can emotionally attach to them. They all are bonded too, you can see their comradeship between them. There is also that naivety to them; they will follow their captain not just on orders but they trust him without question. Captain Miller has so much depth to him. You don't find a lot about him, yet you can tell there is much anguish and longing to leave in his face.Spielberg has taken a more head first look into the second world war. Shinder's List was about the men behind the scenes and the politics, while in Saving Private Ryan we are taken to the view of the soldier. Spielberg's direction is flawless, getting you right into the battle and evoking so much emotion from all the actors. The acting is also flawless. Tom Hanks gives one the his best performances ever, he was brilliant. Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Jeremy Davies all bring great performances as the mix matched group of people, their friendship for all of them was so believable. Matt Damon though only appearing towards the end as Private Ryan does a great job also.Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made, it is a masterpiece of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

This is about the only war-movie that I have ever seen where you just simply become stunned, overwhelmed and shocked by a pandemonium of apocalyptic pictures, sounds and dialogs who ring nothing but true. This film doesn't shy away from stating a simple message, the message that war dehumanizes the human mind and bares open a bestiality that ponders on the verge of uneducated seaweed in terms of emotions. I congratulate you, Steven Spielberg, for being brave and courageous in your way of showing us that war is hell, that it is tedious, brutal, sometimes even boring but most important of all: definitely no laughing matter.

Not a very good (WAR) movie. Just a fiction.,"Many things are flawed in this fiction, which seems to be far away from reality. This does not touch at any point. Better than ""Saving Pvt. Ryan"" are ""the Pianist"", ""Downfall"", and even ""Apocalypse Now"". And even the TV series of ""The Pacific"" is a lot better. I am not a historian, so I may not be 100% correct in many of my thoughts. But in my opinion the kind of sentiments that have been shown in this movie by the military and Military General --- is unbelievable, and somehow ridiculous. Especially if it is related to World War 2, and when America is just getting up from the great depression. Why one boy is so important who had been admitted to the Army to serve his country. Now Army wants to protect this Baby!!! Funny. Every soldier has a Mom and Wife and family. At many times when the soldiers should shoot the enemy, they are letting him walk away in the name of POW. That kind of kindness never happens in reality. And I listened a lot about the opening 30 minutes scene, that it is really fantastic. But it was horrible. The opening scene of ""Shooter"" was much more realistic and exciting. Why the Army will land on the beach in such a suicidal way, for the massacre of their own men??? This is just a good action movie like Black Hawk Down, or Matt Damon's Green Zone.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clichéd,"I saw this movie in the theater when it was released almost 20 years ago. This is what I recall: The first 20 minutes were pretty powerful. After that, not a particularly interesting, innovative or witty script, but still mildly entertaining (considering it's length). What I remember most though, is that the characters (and some dialogue) were clichés....done over and over through the years in American war films. One guy is very scared, another is super violent, etc. I don't remember the details now (it's been too long), but I absolutely cannot forget sitting in the theater thinking, ""wow, this is pretty bad - is it going to get better?"" Strip out the first 20 minutes and the multi- million dollar price tag (mostly special effects, expensive sets and pricey actors) and what you have is an average 1950s war film.I'm not a Spielberg hater. I thought Duel was fantastic. I loved ET as a teenager and Schindler's List as an adult. I've seen many of his films. I can't say I'm a huge fan, but he's obviously talented. I just don't get the accolades given to this film.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
A squad of soldiers  hunt for a Private who is last son of his family to be sent home after three brothers died in the war.,"Just reading the public comments on Saving Private Ryan on this sight made tears come to my eyes. This movie captured my respect as a history lover in that it gave you just what is to be expected during an amphibious landing in WWII. Saving Private Ryan held no punches on war being ugly, sicking and horrific. The only thing that was missing was the smell of battle. The audio visual aspect was, it seems to me, beyond perfect that I was really there on D-Day extremely scared while trying to get off the beach. I recommend this movie to be seen by every U.S. president, senator, representative before taking office. I was told that this war epic was so influential it made potential cadets who viewed it, turn down their West Point appointments.

Looking back with gratitude,"Saving Private Ryan is such a powerful and necessary film and one everyone should watch at one point in their life.It's a simple story; a small group of soldiers are given a mission to retrieve the last surviving of four brothers from behind enemy lines in France. The symbolism of this story and of Ryan himself are profound and personal for all of us today who are partakers of the rights and freedoms given to those liberated by the allied invasion of Europe. The graphic depiction of what these men went through to establish that freedom gives us a difficult reminder of how much we each as individuals owe these men  veterans that are still with us actually went through this! I remember feeling so grateful for their sacrifice, and I left the cinema not so much entertained but shaken. The depth and accuracy of this film remains a testament and a tribute to those brave people, and not the filmmakers themselves. The acting is honest and superb, and the characters are as rich and interesting and ordinary as the real soldiers they could represent. The first time I watched this it was difficult to watch and there were several times when I had to just look away. A technical marvel, an incredible achievement for Steven Spielberg, who remains for me the greatest filmmaker ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the best movies...ever,"**Not known to many viewers: this is based on events that occured during WWII.  Try to find ""Into the Breach"" for more info.**To say that ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the best war films ever made is an understatement.  It might possibly be THE best war film ever made; right up there with other films like ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Platoon,"" ""The Deer Hunter,"" and ""Full Metal Jacket.""  (Yes, I noticed that I used only Nam films, but hey, they're some of the best around!)  And for today's Top 250 poll, it's at #27.  Even that is an understatement.  I believe that SPR should be in the Top 10, maybe even Top 5 best movies of all time.  That's all my opinion.  But here's a plot summary for this masterpiece.James Ryan (Matt Damon) has lost his brothers in combat.  All three of them. So, the government sends Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) with a team of an additional seven to find him and ""get him the hell outta there.""  These people are as diversified as the New Yorker Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns) to the Southern sniper Private Daniel Jackson (Barry Pepper;) the timid translator, Corporal Timothy Upham (Jeremy Davies) to the hardened veteran Sargent Mike Horvath (Tom Sizemore.)  Along the way they encounter various goose chases and German troops, and suffer losses that affect thoughts of how important one Private is.Every actor in this film is up to his element.  I say ""his"" because, well, to be honest, there are no women in this film, except for random typists and Mrs. Ryan, who don't have speaking parts.  Also starring Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Ted Danson.You have not truly lived until you have seen Saving Private Ryan.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Watch this with Black Hawk Down...,"...to see both the horrors of war and the evolution of warfare.But more affecting is the individual and group interactions of the ensemble in SPR - spoken and unspoken - and Spielberg's direction, which made war real, in its terror, ambiguousness, and heroism.Tom Hanks as Cap. Miller is the commanding officer you dream of, warts and all, and his command comes together around him loyally, even in FUBAR situations, in a group of outstanding and heartbreaking performances.The final scenes are among the most suspenseful in war film-making.

An important movie that brings the horror of war to the unfamiliar public.,"As a surgeon that treats wounded soldiers, I was shocked to see the concealed parts of my professional life totally exposed to the unsuspecting individual. This movie is indeed a landmark that exposes the true side of the ""romantic"" wars that have been part of our cultural upbringing for decades, shattering the notion that war is an exciting adventure. It is not ! Soldiers are usually 18-20 year old boys, that get ripped apart by metal objects that kill, maim and cause terrible pain and anguish to their families. Even though this movie had it's Hollywood side, it succeeded in conveying the true nature of warfare - killing in every conceivable way. The ghastly scenes of spilled guts, and blown off limbs are accurate to a point that brings back vivid memories to those that treat wounded soldiers. I sincerely hope that this very explicit movie will cause people to understand the true horrors of war. As Marlon Brando uttered in Apocalypse now: ""The horror, the horror"".",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Spielberg's War,"After the assault on Omaha beach, a group of US soldiers, led by Cpt Miller (Hanks), are sent on a mission to retrieve the sole surviving Ryan brother (Damon). Success will earn them the right to return home.After giving a definitive representation of the holocaust with the excellent ""Schindler's List"" and of slavery with ""Amistad"", Spielberg surprised the world again. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a synergy of old ""men on a mission"" style war films, yet completely redefined how conflicts are to be portrayed on film. The film set a tone of savagery, violence and futility that has marked all war films since (and was perfected in Ridley Scott's awesome ""Black Hawk Down""). As a visualist and action director, Spielberg can count this film as yet another resounding triumph. Whenever the tension goes up, as in the horrific opening battle (cinema's most visceral 20 minutes) or the closing siege, Saving Private Ryan surpasses almost any war film in existence.the film is sadly not without its problems, and it is truly regrettable that Robert Rodat's script isn't up to the standards of Spielberg's direction. Whenever the tension dies down and leaves room for character moments, the film comes dangerously close to silliness or sappiness, ticking many of the worst genre clichés in ways that could make it seem like a flag-waiver despite the obvious overall absurdity the film tries to convey. It is a tribute to the acting talents of Damon, Burns, Ribisi, Sizemore and especially Hanks that the film survives such moments, even if a lame last scene undermines the film's power.Despite its flaws, ""Saving Private Ryan"" has proved its importance and relevance through the considerable influence it has had on cinema action.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Technically amazing, but the story is just okay","Haven't seen this one since it played in theaters. I didn't think all that much of it then. It actually improved a bit on re-watch, though I still find that my problems with it back then have not at all disappeared. My main problem is (and was) that Spielberg really seems to think this film is some deep anti-war statement, some extremely important existential story, and it's just not. At heart, this is very much like the WWII classics The Story of G.I. Joe and Battleground (both directed by the great William A. Wellman), about a group of fairly stereotypical and not all that well defined soldiers who risk their lives for a greater purpose. Sure, they are constantly asking the question ""Is it worth it?"", but Spielberg's (painfully corny) wraparound story, with Private Ryan visiting Arlington National Cemetery, answer that question with a resounding ""DUH!"" Not to mention that the whole existential crisis (why should eight men be sent to die for one?) is a fabricated one, anyway, as it is, after all, fiction. And, during the film's release, we were told over and over again by everyone involved with the film and very gullible film critics that this was an anti-war movie (one of them who could see through that just saw fit to tell us how much more awesome Joe Dante's completely forgotten Small Soldiers was, so he seemed kind of like a crazy homeless person yelling at a wall). Yeah, it's so not that, either. The proof, twelve and a half years later, exists in the slew of WWII themed video games, all very clearly inspired by the film, that have ruled consoles in the past six or so years. I clearly remember Roger Ebert saying that this was the first film that did not make war seem fun, but damned if people aren't having a ton of fun shooting up Nazis on their TVs. I'd guess that Saving Private Ryan has done more to recruit new soldiers than any Army of One commercial ever has.So, yeah, it misses several of its main aims. However, while you can castigate Steven Spielberg for misunderstanding his context, you can't say a thing bad about his technical work on the film. Sure, the hand-held aesthetic that he uses in the battle sequences has inspired a lot of very dire copycats over the past twelve years (try not to laugh during the big battle at the start of Gladiator), but it was pretty brilliant at the time, and it really puts you right there. War might be fun, but it's also damn scary, and I found myself shaking with some tears in my eyes after the gigantic beach storming that opens the film (I try to forget the Arlington sequences exist) finally comes to an end. The slower, more personal moments aren't the best (partly due to the variable cast, which ranges from fantastic (Jeremy Davies) to acceptable (Tom Hanks) to terribly annoying (Edward Burns and Paul Giamatti)), but they're mostly fine, and always beautifully shot. I love some of the smaller moments of the movie, especially the slap that the little French girl gives her father when the G.I.s are able to hand her back to him, after the extraordinarily tense sniper sequence. All in all, while the film is kind of a mixed bag, I do think that the impressive moments far outweigh the overall ponderous nature of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A visual treat,"One of the best war films ever made, Saving Private Ryan is raw and shocking. Not only because of the gore scenes, but also because of the camera-work. Using a steadycam, combined with the absence of music soundtrack during the breathtaking battle scenes, gives a realistic and natural feel to the film. War films are hardly an opportunity for actors to showcase their talent, as more focus is set on the viewer's visual pleasure, but in this film time is taken to describe many of the characters.Generally Saving Private Ryan is almost excellent and highly recommended.My only objections are as regards the choice of Hanks for the main role (a role more suitable to Clooney or Crowe, if you ask me), and Damon's teeth; it's remarkable that a soldier that's been through hell for a long period of time could easily be the protagonist in a toothpaste ad. :o)9",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Great action sequences,Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men land in Normandy on D-Day. The group is ordered to find a Private Ryan after Ryan's brothers are all found to have been killed in action.Director Steven Spielberg creates some of the most thrilling action sequences in a movie. The D-Day landing at the start is some of the most visceral realistic war action ever. It is unforgettable. The movie is bookended with heart stopping war action. The final battle is just as epic. The hand to hand fight with Private Mellish is devastating. The goal doesn't have the same epic scale although it does have the sense of poetry which Spielberg often likes to inject. The only minor objection is the mission which strikes a different tone from the unrelenting realism of the opening landing.,9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Because I think that this movie is the most psychologically disturbing and shocking movie I have ever seen in my life on this planet. I read the revues about the realism of the war scenes and thought what the hell it can't be any worse than ""Platoon"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"", I'll give it a try... bad lapse of judgement.The movie is three hours long, and after maybe the first ten minutes I wanted to leave... but the thought was that sooner or later this assault on the senses must let-up... you wait and you wait and you wait, and it doesn't! The realism, the emotions, the atmosphere of war, are all there for the three full hours. Even in the quiet, I can't use the word peaceful, moments of the movie there are still the oppressive feelings of the expectation that this certainly can not last... and it doesn't. These moments are played to the best effects of the greatest suspense movies.My friend and I left the cinema after the final credits, we couldn't say anything....I don't know whether to think of Mr. Spielberg as the greatest movie maker on the face of this planet... or the most irresponsible manufacturer of shock horror movies ever... but this is really not the correct way to put it because, shocking it was without a shadow of a doubt, but, horror it most definitely was not... If you watched all of the news, or documentaries, that were ever made about the scenes and effects of war it would not be one percent of the preparation required to watch this movie.Anyone who sees this movie can not fail to be affected by it... consequently I tend to ere on the side of Mr Spielberg being a little irresponsible. War is a fact of human life, we can never escape some peoples urge to kill each other... but why show it so graphically on the large screen? At some point in the future, although I hope it never happens, some of our offspring will have to go-out and fight a war for us... why do we have to be shown what they will face?As you can see... I was just a tad affected by this film. But what can I say, Mr Spielberg has outdone Mr Cameron yet again... although my feeling is that this movie will not get the recognition of ""Titanic"" for three reasons: there is no love story, there is no Di-caprio or Winslet... and America does not come out of this movie with the flag of rationality and reason flying high... more like at half mast with no breeze...",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the most spectacular War Movies you will ever see!,"Where to begin? I have to say that 'Saving Private Ryan' is a modern masterpiece, and that negative criticism is basically aimed at opportunities which failed to make this the greatest movie ever made.The plot is simple - Captian Miller, played by Tom Hanks, and his squad of soldiers are given a new assignment following the Normandy Invasion: to find Private James Ryan, played by Matt Damon, who happened to be a paratrooper of the 101st Airborne.The War scenes, despite being truly upsetting and gruesomely realistic, are visually fantastic. The attention to detail by Spielberg is fantastic. The full frame is filled with explosions and whizzing bullets, not to mention with the main subject. However, there is not ONE British soldier in France. Not a single soldier. This definitely doesn't overshadow what I personally think is one of the best movies ever made.The movie has no message. The movie is more sentimental, acknowledging the past, and what our older generation went through in order to keep our country safe, as well as to protect our current, or their future generation. We all know we owe it all to those soldiers. All we can do is mourn our losses, and appreciate, with all of our hearts, the soldiers that made it back home. And, in a way, this film brings people together. Don't watch this with elderly family members otherwise you'll embrace a several sad, and soppy moments.The acting is brilliant. Watching soldiers cry is extremely disturbing in my opinion. They fight against their will to survive in order to complete their mission and fulfil a strategy. And when you are told to duck, you DO duck! Fantastic movie. If you liked Band Of Brothers and felt Thin Red Line could of been better, you'll faint by the effort poured into this excellent film.Pocket yourself with cash and Rent it now.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Upham's POW,"I commented on this in a different thread, but I thought that it deserved mentioning again.

Aside from that, all of a sudden for no reason Upham grows balls and decides to kill this one German and let all the rest go?

As the squad searches to find Private Ryan, they asked the inevitable question, why are they risking their lives to save one soldier.Saving Private Ryan is the best film to react the D-Day landing. It is both horrific and gruesome. It really shows how the landing took place. Unfortunately, the film never gets better than the first 20-25 minutes.The plot is good and is something I have never seen before in a war film. The characters are also very good, though it seems like Speildberg just threw in every military job there is in this film. The Motley Crue includes a sniper, a medic, a linguist, and many more.The directing and dialouge is very well done. It just seems like it takes itself a little too seriously at times. It also seems like some scenes drag on a bit to long.In my opinion, Hanks does a fantastic job, as does everyone else. The only one I thought didn't act as good was Matt Damon as Private Ryan. He has a fairly short role and didn't live up to it.All in all, it is a great war film with good directing, a good cast and a good premise. Its just too bad that it dragged on a bit to long and took itself too seriously. Other than that, it is a great movie to watch if you need a war fix, just don't expect anything revolutionary in the genre.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

(This is pretty much another story like that of the Brother's Sullivan, who are talked about in the movie)However - It has NEVER been depicted like this EVER! The first thirty minutes of this movie will have you glued to the screen. If there is popcorn in front of you it will NOT be getting touched let alone passed anywhere. It is brutal, real, amazing, shocking, TRUE and for a movie the most real battle scene ever put on screen. Spielberg puts you on the beach. The sounds alone envelope you. This is a movie for the big screen and surround sound. Also, I must mention the amazing John William's musical score is nothing less then brilliant accompanying the visuals on screen. That music alone tells such an emotional fantastic story!Actual War veterans who lived through this part of our history said for the most part that what you are seeing on screen by Spielberg is the closest thing ever depicted of that war besides actually being there. (Some could not finish watching the scene) So if you want to see a movie that is so much more then a movie. See this! It centers around one of the most important wars if not the most important for this country and the rest of the world. To be clear though, this movie is not just about that war. The story is told during that time period of our history centering on this one battalions search for a man.OK, how about the rest of the movie? The searching and hopefully the rescue of Private Ryan? Excellent! You will be interested and want to know what happens. A great cast and masterful movie making keep you glued to the end. Oh and Mr. Spielberg does a fantastic job in book ending this movie with two wonderful scenes that tie it all together.I original saw this with my dad on it's original release in theaters. After the movie I asked him what he thought. He literally could not speak for like twenty minutes. You walk away experiencing something so much more then a movie. A small glimpse of our history and US as human beings enduring all the horror, war, laughter, tears and ultimately family and love that keep us wanting to go on.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The best war movie of all time!!!,This movie is one of the best war movies of all time!!! The first 15 minutes are very shocking and there is a lot of blood but it's one of the best part of it. The directing was excellent;Spielberg couldn't do better;especially at the 15 first minutes. The story is quite good and shows you all the misery of the second world war. The actor were fantastic;especially Tom Hanks and Matt Damon.After watching this movie you will feel very lucky if you didn't go war one day.Watch it it's a beautifull movie!!!!!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The best and most realistic war film ever.,"This film has a very deep and personal meaning for me.  My dad was a WWII combat veteran. After seeing this film, I looked at my dad's army photo and metals hanging on our living room wall and I thanked my dad for fighting for our freedom then I cried my eyes out.This is the best and most realistic war film I have ever seen (ranking above PLATOON and GLORY.) Stephen Spielberg really deserved his best director Oscar, because of the great camera angles during the intense Omaha Beach scene. Terrific performances all around.Thank you, Mr. Spielberg for a powerful film that makes us feel even more thankful for the veterans on this Memorial Day.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Brilliant, despite simplified characterizatins","As of three years ago, I have made a point of watching this film on June 6th every year, so that the true meaning of this historic date will never be lost. I know it sounds trite, but with holidays such as Memorial Day quickly becoming an excuse for cookouts, I feel the need to reinforce the terrible and awesome sacrifices that have shaped the course of history. This movie does just that. For all of it's character development shortcomings, it still ranks as simply the most powerful cinematic depiction of war I have ever seen.And as a side note, the whole character development issue almost seems moot, considering the context in which most of these men knew each other. Ready to die for their brothers, many ironically knew very little of each other's personal lives, except for snippets learned during the calm interludes, when the soldier would share stories or letters from a world far away.That is why the betting on what Hank's character does as a civilian makes so much sense. To many, life at home was a carefully guarded treasure that served as a very personal and private link to sanity and hope. If you haven't seen this film, make it a point to do so. You will find a whole new appreciation for the ability of the common man who, faced with impossible odds and true terror, is somehow able to accomplish the extroardinary. It will renew your faith in mankind, while simultaneously horrifying you at man's folly.",,Anonymous,Drama
Powerful War Story.,"Steven Spielberg once again won a best directing Academy Award for this powerful film(based on fact) that opens with the D-Day invasion on Normandy France, and the battle to secure the beaches as the first step toward liberating France. The battle itself is the most realistic portrayal of actual battle conditions ever put to film, so authentic is the chaos, violence, and impact bullets and explosions would really have on limbs and bodies(no sugar-coating or censoring here!) that it is both fascinating yet disturbing as well. Tom Hanks plays Capt. Miller, who is in charge of the platoon, and once the beaches are secured, he is ordered to locate and return home a Private Ryan(Matt Damon) because he has just lost three brothers in battle, and the Army doesn't want the bad publicity of a grieving mother mourning all four sons. Though he and his platoon are astonished by the order, they obey it, and the rest of the film is their journey to find Ryan, and still fight the war.The first section of the film on the beaches is so powerful and realistic, that the search for Ryan almost feels anti-climatic, yet this film still works because of the realism and superb storytelling involved, though the prologue and epilogue lack the dramatic fireworks they were aiming for, they are still moving enough.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of Spielberg's finest.,"'Saving Private Ryan' is not meant to glorify war, rather, it tries to show the audience the pain and suffering of not soldiers, but people.Beginning with the fateful D-Day which has influenced popular video games and other war movies, a company of soldiers is given the mission of pulling a private out from the war front. Confused and annoyed at this objective, the soldiers travel across Normandy in search of someone they never knew, let alone cared about.The band of soldiers have a hard time coming to terms with such an obscure mission. However, they cannot bail out of the objective. After all, they are in the army. Obeying orders can be the difference between winning or losing.Steven Spielberg masterfully creates a duality in the characters: at once they are soldiers, yet at heart they are only civilians. The cast of characters are exceptional: Captain Miller (played by Tom Hanks), keeps the group together and just wants to get the objective over and done with. Pvt. Daniel Jackson (Barry Pepper) is the Godfearing soldier who believes his Lord has given him such talent with the sniper rifle. Pvt. Richard Reibens (Edward Burns) is the one who questions the authority, and feels the mission is unnecessary, and the rest round up the company beautifully. These men are not cookie cutter soldiers: They talk with each other, have feelings, reflect upon their actions; Spielberg brings out the 'other' side of the men at war, and this is what the audience (especially war veterans) can relate to.The direction is great. Spielberg's shots are moving: War is dirty and horrifying, and the bonding between the soldiers are sensitive scenes. The cinematography is excellent, some of the best I have seen from any movie. The sound aspects are just as good, if not better, in depicting the harshness of war.'Saving Private Ryan' is a movie not to be missed, partly because it is arguably the greatest war movie ever made, and partly because it will deter those from the idea of another great war.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing,The first time I saw this movie was at the cinema. The opening scene simply took my breath away. You could really feel the soldiers horror and I as almost crouched down in my seat seeking for cover. I had just eaten before the movie so I ended up feeling really sick when the soldiers where slaughtered on the beach. It is clearly the most realistic war scene ever.The film is brilliant. The actors are great. The story is thrilling. It is one of the best movies about war ever. I think the main purpose of the film is to honor those who fought and died in the struggle against the Nazis in WW2. We owe them a lot.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Raw...Powerful..Emotional,"Wow... I've seen this movie once before, and I decided to watch it again this evening and it had the same effect on me that it did the first time I watched it. Saving Private Ryan is a movie that stays with you long after you watch it.It is affecting and moving, gritty and powerful. You watch this film and you see the hell that is war.You see what it does to people, it dehumanizes them , it strips away their moral compass, their values.The movie is violent and sickeningly realistic, but its violence and graphic scenes are not numbing, you are never detached from the what the soldiers are going through. You watch the action unfold and you are there, you are there feeling the pain of the soldiers.Steven Spielberg has once again drawn us in emotionally to the story. Just as he did with Schindler's list, he uses his gift for compelling story telling and character development, to immerse us in the story,to make us care for the characters.The acting was top notch as well. Tom Hanks,as Capt. John Miller, did an amazing job,probably one of his best roles(besides Forrest Gump and Philadelphia) as did Matt Damon (Private Ryan). The whole cast was perfect and fit right into each of their roles. The underlying score of John Williams, one of my favorite score composers(E.T, Jurassic Park, Star wars, etc.),was used in the right moments,creating tension and at other times, tugging at your heart strings.One of the best movies by Spielberg and ONE of the best WWII movies(not the best but one of them).",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A hudge film !!,"Saving Private Ryan tells an interesting story: the rescue of a young American soldier because his other brothers have died during the second world war.
But this film seems too hudge : 2 hours and 49 minutes for telling the story !!
A great description of these first days of the Allied troops in Normandy and then the long research of the private Ryan.Steven Spielberg could have made a shorter film !!
About performances great names with good acting: Tom hanks, Matt Damon. Tom Sizemore.Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Gionani Ribisi, Ted Danson !!

Simplistic and Unrealistic,"A WWII movie for people who have never seen a real WW 11 movie. Gross oversimplification of the facts, highly unrealistic portrayal of the D Day landing, graphic violence to the nines{all in excruciating close-up shots} and the most stereotyped Nazis since Mel Brooks ""The Producers"". Film is good looking, but like Clint Eastwoods ""Flags of our Fathers"", it just doesn't ring true. But unlike FOOF which does have some truth behind it, this one looks like it was made up as they went along. Tom Hanks is OK in what basically is a no-name actors movie.

Can be an eye opener,"Being still a teenager, I realize that I am still relatively young and may not fully comprehend the true impact of war, if ever.  I know that many have criticized this movie for not truly giving the sense of war or whatnot.In my view, this was not the purpose of the movie.  Instead, I believe that this movie was made as a tribute for those lives lost in the war and to give the audience a more graphic taste of the battlefield.  The viewer may only begin to get a sense of the horror felt by those involved, but I hope that most will never have to know such feelings.Movie-wise, its terrific.  Superb acting, exciting and twisting plot, emotional moments, and edge-of-your-seat action.  I came away speechless with a better view of the true loss of war.While the feelings conveyed are not as realistic as some would like, this movie is also not exactly a light-hearted take on war.  I feel that Hollywood has a responsibility to accurately reproduce the historical subject being represented to the best of their ability, and this is achieved.  The costumes, special effects, sounds, and sets are virtually genuine.The bottom line:  While unable to truly portray the experience of war, the viewer still comes away feeling solemn and respectful with a true sense of loss for those involved.

Top 10 Movie of All Time,"I don't care what anyone says about classic movies, and I'm all for the classics, but this movie is definitely in the top 10 of all time. Seeing this movie in the theater was absolutely hypnotic. I felt as though I was going through everything the characters in the movie went through, and when I was walking home, I distinctly remember feeling a sense of what is probably ""Shell Shock."" I remember thinking, ""What's the point to everything?"" which is something people often struggle through after going to war. This work is more than a movie, its an experience. Sadly its not possible to get quite such an intense feeling when watching it at home unless you have a terrific home theater. The giant screen I saw this movie on added to the incredible effect of the movie which fully enveloped me in the world of the story.The opening scene is one of the best scenes ever put to film. If you don't already know what the scene is about, or even if you do, and you have not seen this movie, go out and rent it right now.

Great tense stuff,"I love this film to bits. Spielberg, Williams and Kaminski strike again with this great WWII front line drama. All actors were excellent in their roles, and I think Hanks was stiffed at the Oscars. I especially liked the beginning of the D-Day landing scene, with Hanks and co. in the transporter. At that point you can really feel the tension building up, mainly because of the shots of the soldiers faces as they waited to hit the beach. The suspense of the situation really built up when you could hear the bullets clanging against the ramp on the front of the transporter, and it was just sheer terror when the ramp fell and the guys at the front were riddled with bullets. The point is, Spielberg makes the audience feel like they're one of the soldiers on the transporter, and I was no exception. I got the real feeling of not wanting to be one of the soldiers there. The length of the landing scene was quite long, getting you into the feel of the time scale. The blood and gore was necessary to depict how horrible this scene was. The thing is, that's what it was really like.Granted, it does get a bit slow when they start looking for Ryan, but not to the point where you're bored enough to want out of the cinema. The bonding between the soldiers in the squad is also highlighted in the film, Corporal Upham for example, being excluded by the others at the start, and by the end is joining in with the lingo (i.e., 'foobar'). The ending tugged on the heart strings plenty, and it shows that Hanks' character was no hero, but a normal human being, hesitating to put his life on the line for another (cf. 'earn this'). The overall effect of this film is pure anti-war.John Williams' score was excellent as usual, and the fact that there was no music in the battle scenes was a good move, so that the audience can concentrate on the action. Kaminski's shots were just genius, his freehand style instantly recognisable, giving a real feeling of terrifying action and movement at the start and end of the film. This film was stiffed at the Oscars. Mark my words.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Wartime Grit with an Unlikely Premise  8 (Very Good),"This Academy Award Winning Best Picture of 1998 contains the grittiest, most graphic war scenes I've ever seen on film. On top of that, the film quality is pristine and the high-speed equipment used to shoot the movie is nothing short of groundbreaking in the war genre. That being the case, does the artistic quality of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN automatically overshadow/surpass the other movies of 1998 like American History X or Run Lola Run for example? Perhaps so.Still, as I attribute the entire 8 stars to artistic merit, the last two gaping empty stars must be addressed. The premise that the movie is based upon, namely the mission of bringing back one soldier to his mother mandated by the war department, is simply something I cannot swallow. What's the word I want to use to describe how I feel about the impetus for the movie? It's not cheesy, nor is it saccharine. I feel as if it's an insult to my intelligence. Let me spell this out word for word...First of all, I simply don't understand why history has been racked with so many wars. I'm not rabidly anti-war per Se. I just want to understand why the people of one nation collectively want to kill the people of another nation. IMDb is not the place to discuss such issues at length, so let's assume for now that wars are fought for any of a million reasons: defense, propagation of freedom, power, resources, territory, maybe the utter lack of something better to do.Now here is my gripe with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which otherwise is a masterpiece. If the war department is focusing all of its energy and machinery on the above mentioned war objectives, is it plausible for them to really care about one kid or his mother? I am curious how the parents of American soldiers killed in Iraq feel when they watch this movie. I just cannot for one second believe that the American defense department would go to such lengths for any single individual.Rather than swallow this implausible premise hook line and sinker, I would more enjoy a film that exposes the real modus operandi behind bloodthirsty war machinery. Platoon or Apocalypse Now are considered classics, and rightly so given the grimy mood each depicts. But despite is technologically phenomenal production, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is too heavy with the flag-waving patriotic Dreamworks score and tells a story you'd only find off the shelves of Disney Corporation -- one that is sugar-coated at the core and just plain fantasy.JYjimboduck-dot-com",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Years later, the propaganda emerges more clearly. . .","I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" in a theatre in its first release, and still watch it five or six times a year, for all sorts of reasons. Eleven years later, I'm starting to know more clearly what I'd like to say about this important film.First, the mastery of cinematic technique shown by Steven Spielberg and his entire production crew is still exciting, and moving to me. A viewer's sense of being on the Normandy beach, panic-stricken in the thick of the chaotic energy, has not been dissipated by ten years of other films' computer effects and three-second jump cuts. The randomness of events, on the beach and after, is a kind of nightmare in a ruined pastoral landscape, and clarifies each soldier's need to withdraw to a sense of what to do, right now, to stay alive - right up to the moment when the impulse to take care of a friend, or a child, overrules common sense and the discipline of self-preservation.Second, though, I'm more saddened every year by the myopic focus on American myth-making which Mr Spielberg embraced. He's made a wholly self-centred film about D-Day, and a generation of moviegoers will never know from this movie that the British, Canadian, Australian, and other Allied troops were landing up and down the French coast at the same moment. The Canadians, in fact, advanced considerably farther inland than the Americans that day, under equally heavy fire. Tom Hank's character mentions British Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery leading his troops toward Germany; Ted Danson's character says ""That guy's overrated!"" and Hanks's character says ""No argument from me."" That's the total mention of the Allied participation in the invasion, and Montgomery's stature in defeating the Germans in North Africa a year earlier is erased for a whole generation of film goers, even though his excellent leadership in North Africa earned him command of the British troops on June 6th. The omissions, and flip judgments reflect badly on the scriptwriter, and on Mr Spielberg.Third, the halo of sanctity which this film bestows on the members of the special mission has become cloying. The soldiers of this film seem to me to justify an American myth of charming immaturity, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" dodges completely the documented ways in which American soldiers' unpreparedness during and after the invasion was an acknowledged problem during the last year of the war, especially in the Battle of the Bulge, when American troops collapsed in the face of the German attacks.I'm realising that, for me, ""Saving Private Ryan"" clashes seriously with the historical record, and that in this sense, it's a meretricious fantasy, however grippingly filmed. I'll still watch it, and feel the adrenaline flow on the beach, below the machine-gun nest, and in front of the bridge, but I won't subscribe to the myths.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Dangerous, as we know.","Between hobnobbing in Martha's Vinyard, Spielberg has, as we know, been trying to claim the holocaust, slavery, war, and other ethical properties as his (American) own. Now there is an ambition.The message for this film can well be construed as Do What the General Says, Because It's the Right Thing to Do. Feel Good About Agonizing Over This Question, But Do What The General Says (AKA ""shoot and weep""). It's an old (my apologies) Fascist trick. Raise a genuinely important, painful issue, then sooth the pain with a quick, unambiguous appeal to both duty and moral recognition, the split between moral recognition and action here acts as the ethical seal of approval. Would we not all like life to be so simple...Sadly there have been other cases in more recent history where a similarly confident recommendation, Bear the Pain of Pulling that Trigger with Loyal Pride, seem to have landed everyone in serious trouble. History may never repeat itself, but Spielberg is out to prove us wrong.Rating should, perhaps, be, not quite ""1"" for ""awful,"" but rather ""10"" for inducing shock and awe.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Spielberg's Masterful, Unflinching Look At World War II","Beginning with his 1993 Holocaust epic SCHINDLER'S LIST, legendary director Steven Spielberg began a pattern, one that continues to this day, of alternating between making crowd-pleasing ""popcorn"" films and more serious, meditative, often historically based films that has continued to this day. And by and large, he has succeeded in ways that are extremely typical of him. One of the best examples of this was his 1998 World War II masterpiece SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. A film about the war in which Spielberg's father's generation fought to save the world and humanity from the worst of itself, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was unflinching in showing what the men who fought it had to go through. And yet, the film not only won five Academy Awards (and rightly so), it made nearly half a billion dollars at the box office.Framed at both ends by a visit to a French cemetery by the aging titular character, Saving Private Ryan begins with the D-Day landing at Normandy on the overcast morning of June 6, 1944. Tom Hanks portrays one of the leaders of a particular Army unit who leads his men ashore to be met by the enormous firepower pouring forth from the German bunkers high on the cliffs overlooking Omaha Beach. The battle, which began the liberation of Europe, is rendered in the most realistic and horrific way possible, true to the actual facts of history and the men who were there. Once the Allied forces are on the beach and take the cliffs, they begin their push towards liberating France and, subsequently, all of Europe from the Nazis.There, Hanks and his unit, which includes Edward Burns and Tom Sizemore, are assigned the awesome task of finding the last surviving member of an Iowa family, who had been a part of a paratroop squad that had parachuted behind enemy lines the night before the invasion, and who is now missing. Three of this man's brothers have already been killed in combat in other theaters of the war, and it is up to Hanks to find him and give him his ticket home. He and his men trudge through the rain-drenched and bomb-scarred French countryside, fighting off attacks from Nazi troops. They eventually arrive in the bombed-out village of Ramele to find the missing man (Matt Damon) still very much alive and with his company, but unwilling to be ""saved"" just yet for the fear of abandoning the only real ""family"" he has left, his own unit. It comes down to what it means to be a human being, and maintain one's humanity, in a world torn apart by war and genocidal insanity.Without question, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is yet another sterling example of Spielberg's great filmmaking and storytelling style, traits that are second-to-none in Hollywood. While SCHINDLER'S LIST was a tribute to his mother's Jewish heritage, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was a way of not only paying tribute to his father's generation, but also a way of reconciling with his father, from whom he had been estranged since the late 1960s. The opening Normandy landing and the battle at Ramele are both depicted with such a painful degree of realism and graphic specificity that many in the audience who otherwise wouldn't flinch at ultra-violent Hollywood action blockbusters found this all but impossible to watch. But Spielberg was only trying to tell the story about the war as close to the way the men who actually had to fight it remembered it. The truth about D-Day is that it was no picnic for the Allies; of the first 2500 soldiers who landing on Normandy, only eighty-three survived that horrific day before the bulk of Allied forces managed to overwhelm the German bunkers. If Spielberg's brand of realism upset the constitutions of certain audience members, then that was the price they would have to pay for seeing this enormously emotional and realistic movie.In terms of acting, there is much to be had from the performances of everyone involved, particularly Hanks, whose character's Everyman quality truly attracted both the actor and Spielberg, both in terms of that quality and as a composite of the combat soldier of the time. But SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is not a piece of gung-ho jingoism. Spielberg's view is that heroism can't be portrayed in mere shades of black and white or exploited for political gain, as has so often been the case in post-9/11 America, but with a degree of pragmatism and reality that is true to history and life itself. It is that kind of realism that makes SAVING PRIVATE RYAN an important American movie for the ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Realistic footage for sure,"I'm a high school student, and recently, before a trip to visit the D-Day beaches in Normandy, we had a vet who was a medic on D-Day come in and talk to our class. We asked him about his experiences AT D-Day, and he was disinclined to talk too much about it, but said that the first 20 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" were like a newsreel. He even told a story briefly about trying to save a man, dragging the man behind him, only to discover after a little ways that he only had the top half of the man, and that the rest had been blown off, which was actually depicted in the movie. I really appreciated the artistic qualities of the movie as well. The muted color added a somber atmosphere to the movie, and the way Spielberg used realistic equipment and sound effects really impressed me. His set for the invasion was incredibly accurate- when I first viewed the movie, I thought it had been filmed on location. Thumbs up, Steve!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Revisiting Normandy 3. Omaha Beach 4.Wade's Death Are most probably my favourites.

The movie got me interested in WWII.,"Before I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" I wasn't interested in anything WWII related. Every time there was a documentary on I would change the channel, I couldn't stand classics such as ""The Guns of Navarone"", ""The Eagle Has Landed"" and ""The Longest Day"", I even didn't liked ""Schindler's List"". And then I saw ""Saving Private Ryan""...""Saving Private Ryan"" is more than just an ordinary war movie. Its realism makes it important to watch for the entire world. It shows the horrors of war in a very direct way. It is mainly important to see for the young generation these days and those to come. Sure you can watch tons of documentaries and read dozens of books but watching this movie is the closest you can get to the real thing, it's that realistic.The first 30 minutes is a real wake up call. The Normandy invasion is really impressive and made very realistic with lots of noise and body parts flying around. The cinematography and the sound makes you feel like you are right in the middle of it. Yes, after that the movie becomes a bit slow but it never becomes uninteresting. The movie takes its time to build up the characters. As a result there follow some typical Spielberg sentiments but in this case I'll forgive him for that, I even forgive him for some of the American patriotism he puts in the movie.The D-Day landing isn't the only impressive thing about this movie. All of the battle sequences are filmed in an unique and very realistic way. The final battle is very tense, especially in the beginning when the tension gets build up right before the battle begins and you can hear the tanks approaching while the men nervously await. My heartbeat went at least 3 times faster than normal.I also like the portrayal of the German soldiers. In most other earlier movies they were portrayed as the ultimate bad guys that love to march and kill and follow every order they receive without thinking for them selves. In ""Saving Private Ryan"" they are more portrayed as just soldiers. Sure they do some bad things in the movie but so do the American soldiers, shooting surrendering Germans for instance. ""Saving Private Ryan"" show that there are no real good guys in war, which is very close to the truth I think.The characters are very realistic with real emotions. It also doesn't matter in the movie if you're a main character or the most interesting character of the movie, just like in real life everybody is vulnerable. The characters are wonderfully portrayed by an at the time and still relatively unknown cast, with the exception of Tom Hanks and Matt Damon of courseThe movie and its style set the standards for many later war movies to come but none of them comes really close to this masterpiece.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
War,"I can't claim that Spielberg has overwhelmed me on many an occasion. I tend to find his work somewhat sentimental and too bright and up-beat for my world-view. But here, he delivers. The first thirty minutes or so of this will pretty much tell you what you need to know(and I mean that in the most positive way possible), and few will manage to avoid being pulled in, right from the start in a grip that only really lets go when the credits roll. The production quality is rather close to setting a new standard for highest. The direction is spot-on(there's some beautiful underplaying going on here), and almost all of the emotional material is done exactly right(there was perhaps one bit near the end that just it is not quite there). The pacing is flawless, this never loses your interest(in spite of being close to three hours) nor moves so fast that the audience is lost. The acting is impressive(this thing's got enough acting power to fuel half a dozen of these), even Mark Vincent(even if he'd prefer we called him Vin Diesel) isn't bad(yeah, I know...I could kick myself, and no thanks, Amy). The realism is an accomplishment; the situations, the reactions, the people, everything, almost the entire way through is so close to the real thing you'd swear someone colorized actual footage or something. There is some Hollywood herein, however, but the scales are tipped so far in favour of the authenticity, it's a very, very minor complaint. Cinematography and editing are just amazing... they really bring the scenes to life, and give you a sense of what it must be like to really be there. This has got atmosphere to spare. There is a lot of violence and language. The writing is remarkable, and many details are magnificent. The story isn't the most engaging ever in an anti-war film, but it certainly is good. I recommend this to any fan of war movies, just do realize that this holds little back in its depiction. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Greatest War Movie Ever...No WAY!,"Heck, this is only the third best war movie nominated for Best Picture in 1998. The D-Day Invasion scene is amazing. The problem I have with the movie Saving Private Ryan is the whole Saving Private Ryan part. The tale seems trite and uninspiring. I want to care about a core group of characters or at least one. That's what draws me to The Deer Hunter (78) or this year's Life is Beautiful. There are so many war movies out there that were amazing. I will grant you that Saving Private Ryan is the most accurate telling of D-Day, but heck it's not up for Best Documentary. If Saving Private Ryan wins Best Picture, it will be the second Tom Hanks movie of the 90s that did not deserve the award.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

I can't figure it out the story was not good at all in any way. also it makes the enemies seem heartless and idolizes america.

I could name so many more that are better like the thin red line, paths to glory, glory, ran, Dr. Strangelove, lawrence of Arabia, the deer hunter, das boot, the killing fields, brave heart, stalag 17, and in my opinion the greatest apocalypse now.

God Bless America,"This movie has extremely high production values. Superb direction, great acting,magnificent special effects are all present here.It is only the script that is lacking.The story is contrived and slight with sentimental and unrealistic dialogue.The opening thirty minutes are breathtaking and the movie is well worth seeing for this sequence which is one of the most convincing battle scenes on film.However, the rest of the film,while good, is just too long.Black marks to Steven Spielberg for his unsympathetic portrayal of the German soldiers.Generation after generation of American film-makers have portrayed the Germans as cruel people in war movies.I would have thought a director with the distinction of Steven Spielberg could have seen the German Army from a more human perspective.It was not only US soldiers who suffered in the war.Despite the realism,this was another movie where America and good ol' American values win the day. This is one movie that suffers on Video and TV.Ideally should be seen in the cinema to get the full effect",,Anonymous,Drama
No ideology can resist such a piece of cinema triumph,"I visited the forums, read reviews in IMDb, read reviews of critics, talked to the people around me and as I see, people are not excited about the movie like me, it means that they don't see the greatness of the movie? or are there some other reasons? I want to give the example of The Terminator 2. If you have seen the movie, you know that, according to many people, it is the greatest action movie ever made. In IMDb, you cannot see an user easily who gives a low rating or says that it was not a very good movie. Firstly, I want to talk about that, why Saving Private Ryan is not appreciated in its genre, war like The Terminator 2? People are very cold towards this movie, as if it is just an usual but good or pretty good movie. Or they say that Omaha Beach sequence was cool (enough?) but the rest was bad. Now, at this point, I want to say that now I am writing a review on the movie which to me, one of the greatest movies of all time. This is pure cinema, maybe not a work of art, but a truly cinematic experience. Direction, the cinematography, editing, art direction, sound, sound editing and visual effects (briefly mise-en-scene) are great, the shots are great. You know, if a war movie includes action, people say that disliked it, because it was not an anti war movie and also it shows war artistic, but what if this is the style of the director? The Thin Red Line was also very artistic, but is this really a flaw? Returning to the content or the messages of the film, people say propaganda, militarist, one sided etc. As a person who got sick of hearing historically inaccurate or this movie is propaganda, I don't care about ideology while thinking about this movie. As for one sided criticism, always the same, it shows the enemy side as evil. Does somebody have to make two movies like Clint Eastwood if he makes a war movie? Well, if you ask me, No. By the way, the scene which the German soldier sings an American march is criticized, so people say Spielberg humiliates Germans. If you want to 'read' it like that, do it, but to me it was an unforgettable and tragicomic scene. The best (or the most horrible?) D-Day interpretation is here. At this point, as said before, a lot of people think that just Omaha Beach sequence was just cool. I think it is more than that. Also the structure of the movie is very different than many mainstream movies which is another success. Lastly, in the middle of the movie, there is a sequence, it rains and later they find a little girl, that sequence should be taught in cinema history lessons especially for the people who are planning to be a director.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Unique film,"Saving Private Ryan caused WWII vets to leave the theatre during the film. Sounds like a bad movie? Well that's incorrect, they left due to the emotions it made them feel and how real the movie seemed. This comes as no surprise since it is a Steven Spielberg movie. He is a much decorated film maker who is good with serious genres. He certainly did not let down in this instant classic.The movie does an excellent job at showing the terrifying reality of war. The opening battle scene might just make you cringe as it starts off in the blood bath of Omaha Beach. This lasts about 24 minutes but leaves a much longer lasting impression. While the blood and gore of the movie might turn you off, it does show a personal humanistic side. Tom hanks as the leading actor does a good job at making you feel what it was like to be in that situation. Tom Hanks who is also known to be a much decorated actor, had experience of acting out war scenes from the hit film Forest Gump.The graphics and design of this movie were magnificent. The designers studied many things about WWII and the way it looked in order to put together such realistic scenes. It's as close to war as you can get in a film. Everything down to the stitches on the uniform is done as historically accurate as possible. Also the animated portions were beyond its time. There is a scene where a soldier is trying to put his guts back into his body that is so detailed it kind of makes me sick. This movie broke many graphic barriers for the time is what made and really began a new era of historic war movies.The plot consists of a young Private Ryan whose three brothers were killed in action. Since he is the last of his brothers left, the marines feel the need to bring him back home to his mother. This mission is given to a small group of men led by Tom Hanks. This plot is based on historical truths so the concept of it cannot be argued by critics. That doesn't mean the idea of this real life issue can't be questioned however. The problem of this plot was seen throughout the movie in the soldiers' eyes. As the group started to lose men over one private, they began to question what they were doing. A scene in which the soldiers start arguing about it and one pulls a gun on the other really makes you feel this moral struggle. Audience members who became attached to these characters also started to question the idea of saving one man for the price of many. Tom Hanks settled down these doubts, however, in a heartfelt speech during the scene of argument and kept his soldiers focused.Being emotionally connected to the characters was a strong suit the movie showed. It made it better than just a bloody war film. It made you feel as if you were there and part of it. You grow to care for each member of the group as the film goes on. Which makes it that much harder when they start to die off. A scene in which they gave background stories of where they're from helped strengthen the connection.This movie is intense and is definitely not okay for kids. It receives an R rating for blood, gore, and language. Veterans of our military will be much more appreciated after a film like this. What makes this movie special is that it doesn't only show the horrible non-humane aspects of war, it also shows the morality and heroics these brave soldiers showed in order to protect a good cause. Saving Private Ryan is a unique film because of that.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Simply the best,"This movie truly deserves a spot on the top 10 best war movies. No words can express the feelings you get while watching this movie.Right at the start you're being thrown right into the heat of the battle, the starting 27 minutes are absolutely amazing, in the way that Steven Spielberg (the director) did tremendously good job at making his vision come true. The scenes were ""extraordinary"" sort to say, in the way that he tried to recreate that WW2 ""Battlefield Cameraman"" aesthetic. If you watch any footage from WW2 you can see the hand- held camera is shaky and when an explosion or something else happens nearby, the camera goes everywhere and the footage gets interrupted. Steven used this and made the movie feel chaotic. The scenes looked so real and felt so chaotic up to the point that REAL D-Day veterans who watched this movie had relived the horror of Omaha beach because of their PTSD, and when this movie was released they setup a hotlink for anyone who had received these horrible ""flash backs"". That is such a terrible thing, and my heart goes out to the veterans who had to relive this chaos all over again. Then again... as terrible as this sounds, this is quite the achievement for Spielberg in the way that he made it look so real, that it was too real.Never the less, the rest of the movie had you on edge, i'm not telling you how. You should know, if you don't. Then go watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the biggest upsets in Oscar history!,"'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN': Five Stars (Out of Five)Steven Spielberg's epic World War II film (from 1998) earned him his second Academy Award for Best Director although it failed to win best picture (being robbed by 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE') in one of the biggest upsets in Oscar history and certainly my lifetime (next to maybe 'CRASH' beating out 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' in 2006). It's still considered one of the greatest and most realistic war films ever made though, being praised most of all for it's opening 27 minute 'Normandy Landings' scene (which was named ""best battle scene of all time"" by Empire magazine). It's one of my favorite war and Spielberg movies ever and probably my favorite film of 1998!The film was written by Robert Rodat and inspired by a monument, memorializing soldiers killed in battle from the Civil War to Vietnam, which lists eight siblings killed in the American Civil War. 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' revolves around a soldier, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), who's three brothers are all killed in World War II. In order to relieve distress to his mother Army Chief of Staff, George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), orders eight soldiers to find Ryan and bring him home to safety. They're lead by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), who just survived the Normandy Landings. Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper and Vin Diesel play the other seven soldiers.The film was criticized by some, including filmmaker Oliver Stone, who felt movies like it helped influence the Iraq War (due to World War II being portrayed as 'the good war'). I don't really agree with that assessment but I can see their point. The movie is a masterpiece in my opinion and I think everyone should see it as a tribute to all the soldiers who've died in war. The first time I saw it in the theater was one of the most memorable film going experiences of my life. Who could ever forget those opening 27 minutes (it portrays one of the most nightmarish images ever caught on film)! I think this movie is Spielberg at his very best (in my opinion it's a greater achievement than 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' even). To say I like it more than his more fun movies like 'JAWS', 'E.T.' or the 'INDIANA JONES' series would probably be a lie but it is a more important film and one of the very best of 1998 (definitely better than 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE').Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne8a_WCFo3A",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Saving Private Ryan is a great film,"Saving Private Ryan is a great film. The film's second scene, which is based on Omaha Beach on D-Day really makes the whole film 10/10, as if it wasn't for that scene, I would have probably given it an 8/10. This is because of the action in the scene, as Steven Spielberg shows a good example of what happened to the soldiers that day, and what a struggle it was. Other than the D-Day scene, the film is still amazing, as it provides lots of drama, such as the scene with the tense sniper game, and the parents daughter being taken. Also the part in the destroyed town, which is a big part of the story. Altogether Saving Private Ryan is a spectacular film, and I would recommend it to anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Saving Private Ryan review,"Steven Spielberg Lived up to his legacy once again when creating this Powerfully moving film. By combining amazing actors, eye opening details, and an absolute genius plot, he creates one of the most iconic films ever. Try sitting through the opening scene of D-Day. Spielberg ingenuity when recreating this event is absolutely perfect. He puts you in the boots of brave soldiers who threw their bodies at the wall of German Nazis gunfire. This draws you into the movie and makes you excited, but nervous to find out what's next for this group of men. This type of plot creates a sense of attachment to Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and his 2nd Ranger Battalion as they go on what seems like a pointless mission to find missing Private Ryan (Matt Damon). As the film goes on you yourself might even question, is it really worth sending eight experienced men to find this one missing soldier? Spielberg hit the jack pot with his cast. Many of which were in their primes of acting or just starting to be known for their amazing talents. Such as Tom Sizemore (Sergeant Horvath), Vin Diesel (Private Caparzo), Edward Burns (Private Reiben), Matt Damon (Private Ryan), and of course the great Tom Hanks (Captain Miller). Tom Hanks (Captain Miller) is in short, a genius. His ability to be a ""utility man"" and play almost any role in a movie makes him one of the greatest actors ever, and he doesn't let us down with his astonishing role. Every line he gives draws you into his character, as a weary old Captain who has seen too much for any person to handle, and is ready to go home to his wife. The actors and plot aren't the only things that made this movie amazing. This film also put so much detail into locations, props, and people, and make it a life like war zone. With crumbling structures from constant attack, and overgrown vegetation, creating a sense of abandonment and eeriness. This detail is the most important factor when making such an emotional film. It allows the audience to get that much deeper into the scene and making it that much more believable.With such a great movie you must be thinking are there any setbacks to why I shouldn't see this amazing film? Sadly, there is one thing you should be ready for. If you can get past constant gore, and a bit of cuss words. I hope you have a lot of time on your hands. This film is 2 hours and 50 minutes. So I hope you're okay with giving up a large chunk of your day, but don't worry! It is beyond worth it. Despite this small complication, Saving Private Ryan is an amazing creation, full of action, drama, and tons of explosions. You will be involved with every second this film has to offer, and with no doubt will want to see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

He has terrible taste sometimes, such as Hanks shooting at the tank on the bridge which reminds us of 'Jaws' which wakes us up to the fact that it's only a movie.I watch it for the middle and end which are thrilling, although that may not have been the emotion intended, but that's Barnum for you. The middle section is more traditional and recalls the morality scene in 'Guns Of Navarone' where they have to execute the informer. It works there but is incongruous here, because of the verite style of the war sequences.",,Anonymous,Drama

This scene alone is a excruciating masterpiece. The film settles then in to a journey through hell picture, it still remains unforgettable. No matter how many times you are watching ""Saving Private Ryan"", it grabs you from the opening scene and does not let go this the very last image.

Greatest Tribute to the Greatest Generation,"Saving Private Ryan is one of the greatest war movies ever made. It's an unbelievably emotionally powerful film that inspires a horror seldom seen in the usual Hollywood movie. This has to be not only one of the greatest war movies ever made, but possibly THE greatest movie ever ever made. I would easily put it on the level of the Godfather movies. Why? SPR has infinite character depth. There are no GI Joes or murderous killers that every single war movie needs to have. Every soldier is just that - a soldier. I may also be one of the few who felt sorry for Upham. Keep in mind that he wasn't a soldier per se. He was an interpreter. Also, keep in mind that he hadn't really established a bond with the unit yet, which was something that they all shared.SPR has a realistic portrayal of WWII. They even portrayed the Germans and SS better than any movie I have ever seen. It also forces you to feel sorry for soldiers of both sides, like when the two American soldiers shot the two Czechs (I believe, as mentioned on the forum) who surrendered, and then taunted them. This was a subtlety that I only recently found out about. I always assumed that they were German.Tom Hank's character was truly great. He wasn't a stock character at all, and seemed like he could be a real person. This was actually true for all of the characters. I also, guiltily, felt a little sorry for Steam Boat Willie, who was probably going to be executed in a ditch for being the sole survivor of, you know. You know what happens in the final scene, and I couldn't feel sorry for him anymore, and was happy, as we all were, when the event after that happened. This was just one of the many amazing themes and subtleties that were involved with this movie. I have seen it over 15 times, and still notice new things every time.In conclusion, this movie is gruesome but beautiful. What greater present for Veterans Day is there than to watch this movie? They truly were the greatest Generation, and their gift of freedom to us keeps on giving.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An Incredible film,"Saving Private Ryan is one one of Spielberg's best movies, and that's saying a lot. It was an incredible experience and the first twenty minutes or so was intense, graphic, and completely realistic. It is known as probably one of the greatest scenes in cinema history ever. It was a great beginning to an incredible movie.Tom Hanks plays Captain John H. Miller. After surviving the attack at Omaha Beach (known now as D-Day) he and his platoon are given new orders to search for a private Ryan and bring him back home. You see, all of Ryan's brothers have been killed in combat, and since he is the last survivor, the higher ups in the U.S. military want him returned safely to his grieving mother who has already lost three of her boys.Miller of course takes the job. He doesn't much like it, but he is just following the orders of his superiors. When he tells his platoon about it, they are all against it. After all, why should they risk all their lives for one person. They gripe about it, but ultimately they followed their leader and go on the search mission behind enemy lines where Ryan's squadron was parachuted in.Along the way we learn about the characters, yet the pace never was drawn out. As the action is happening we are also learning a little bit about the characters. Vin Diesel had and early roll with this movie, and other actors include Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Mike Horvath, Edward Burns as Private Richard Reiben, Barry Pepper as Private Daniel Jackson, Adam Goldberg as Private Stanley Mellish, and Henry Thomas. All were good in their roles.This movie had excellent cinematography and editing as well as great sound. It was no wonder it won the academy awards for all of these, and I also believe that Spielberg's Oscar for Best Director was the right choice. Tom Hanks was the main star, but Spielberg's directing made all the characters seem just as important, and kept the pace of the moving going without any real slow up.My only question would be about the story which is told form a soldier's view. I have know problem with the story being told from that view, but what I do have a problem with is believing that our leaders would create a mission that would risk eight of their men to save one. I know that the grieving mother lost three of her boys, but would our military really go through all this for one man? I don't think so. But then it is just a movie. Overall I enjoyed it, and would highly recommend it to anybody.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Hands down the best war movie ever,"Not only the best war movie but probably the most realistic movie where man confronts death. I have seen every movie on the subject of violence, gore, war etc. and though this is not a gore fest just for the sake of showing blood, the blood and gut aspect rates up with any for realism. Such as it is war is bloody and this shows it.Let me make one thing clear. This does not mean the movie isn't top notch every where else. In fact that's the reason the bloody fighting is so real because the acting and directing brings it to life. Spielberg has to be totally commended as I can't think of one director aside of maybe Ron Howard who could have brought the realism to film that this winner does.Tom Hanks is absolutely outstanding. It is in his 3 top best and may be his finest. That's up for others to decide. Never the less he is superb. But he is not the only one. Tom Sizemore who I think never gets enough credit is fantastic as well as is Ed Burns. In fact I have to rate this as the best supporting cast in any movie I have ever seen. They are that good. They just feed off each other and it shows in every scene.Speaking of scenes there are literally dozens of outstanding ones in this but the one that really got me was when Jeremy Davies who plays CPL Upham (He played his character so good I wanted to strangle him for his cowardice) can't muster the courage to go up the stairs and help Adam Goldberg who played Pvt. Mellish (another outstanding acting job) in his fight with the German Soldier. I actually was holding my breath when the German was slowly plunging the knife into Mellish's chest and whispering to him to ""shh shh shh"" thus killing him.Without doubt a movie for all time. As far as realism and just plain great acting, direction production sets etc, etc, etc, this is as good as any there has ever been made. I rate it 5 out of 5...no make that 6 out of 5. Awesome is the only way I can describe it. I have watched it at least 5 times and never get bored.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Terrifying and emotionally draining piece which places the viewer at the forefront of chaos, angst and deliberation in 1944 France.","Saving Private Ryan is Spielberg's anti-thesis to the action movie, indeed the blockbuster ideology. From the man who made his name, indeed inspired a entire movement if you'd like to label the blockbuster so, in making 1975's Jaws; a film that skipped along the boundaries of comedy, horror and sheer action driven spectacle, comes a film that combines the latter two of those three and approaches them from a completely different angle. Whilst Spielberg-helmed; starring functional, friendly, relaxed and 'accessable' lead Tom Hanks; released in the summer month of July in America, but getting a more realised winter period release everywhere else and very much arriving as a genre film, Saving Private Ryan is anything but the usual summertime-Spielberg-Hanks led flick, instead turning a entire 'promise' into a thing of pure terror. In a summer that saw Deep Impact, Armeggeddon and Godzilla released in close proximity, Saving Private Ryan must have been quite the jolt.People have written in the past about the degrees of sentimentality and the nuisance to do with the unreliable narrator. I think it's impossible to look, or even think, back to the times of The Second World War without a sense of sentimentality. The notes that accompany the DVD state that Spielberg attempted to get across that orally guided sense of the father telling the child, ie; his father informing him of the horrors of the war. Such an approach, to some, might sound a little convention, indeed like a cliché, or something that contains a degree of sentimentality. Essentially, this is exactly what Spielberg does in Saving Private Ryan; he doesn't trivialise in rendering it TV movie of the week built around some harsh battle scenes, he delivers on a true-to-life narrative as told through the perspective of someone who wasn't there but is aware of the horrors, much in the way anybody born post WWII might attempt to re-imagine what it must have been like to fight under certain conditions.The film is, in fact, delivered by way of a flashback – a delving into the past a specific soldier does in order so that we may relive what occurred over the space of half a dozen or so days, echoing Spielberg's own relation to the war stories of old by way of his father. The film is about unity; teamwork and the risk of sacrifice those undertake for individuals they are yet to meet, for the platoon in Saving Private Ryan it is an individual they know is out there but in the grander scale of things, it is for people spanning a number of generations across a number of nations they will certainly never encounter.Following the flashback, Spielberg provides us with a few seconds of calm before the storm in the form of waves lapping up on a beach. The place is northern France, the event is D-Day in 1944. Much has been written about the landings, going into them would only repeat what has been said but it's worth noting that the first lines anybody ever says once all the vomiting and praying in the landing crafts has stopped arrives in the form of a load of military directions and ramblings which the viewer might not properly hear, enhancing confusion and a sense of disorientation just prior to the drawn out sequence of carnage. With this, and as pointed out in a review in a publication, the casting of Hanks as Captain John Miller gives the audience something to map onto amidst the chaos, as actors that do not carry similar weight to Hanks are either blown apart around him or placed in this Hellish cauldron. However, years later the likes of Pepper; Burns and Diesel have since established themselves as names and face thus threatening to dampen the intended purpose of anonymity Spielberg meant. Viewing it recently, I do not feel any of the impact is particularly lost.Their eventual mission to seek out the Private Ryan of the title, a certain Matt Damon, who's located somewhere pretty deep within northern France; deep enough so that the march there will last half a dozen or so days march for the troops. Miller's platoon is made up of the guys that survived with him on the beaches of D-Day plus a certain Private by name of Upham, a trilingual troop played by Jeremy Davies who does his usual scrawny; softly spoken; seemingly untrustworthy and somewhat ill-at-ease-with-everyone-else act which was fresher back then than it is now. Miller's professionalism is only enforced by talk of a highly dangerous, off screen mission he undertook; one that saw him and his crew knock out a number of German anti-air craft guns. Dennis Farina's somewhat impressed and therefore transfixed gaze locks onto a talking Miller, as the emphasis in his character's superiority in military activity is encored. He and his platoon's journey is punctuated by interactions with French families; German snipers; machine gun nests and conflicts with each other as they go in search.To say the film concludes with an almighty shoot-out between two sides in a bombed out and long since deserted French town, would be grossly misleading. In a sense, an action film might very well 'build' to an explosive and dramatic set piece but while Saving Private Ryan might conform to a series of heroic actions, followed by a twist in fate just as a fatal blow is about to be struck to whom we think is the 'lead', the lingering feeling is on the sense of loss more-so spectacle. One might argue the sequence comes across as more stark and more frightening than the opening beach landings simply because of the presence of the reason the platoon are even there; the fear of loss of life comes across as more prominent in a film that has thus far displayed a massive amount of loss. The film is a towering achievement, and one of the better films out of the decade that-was the 1990s.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An All-Time Classic,"A true classic. And honestly my favorite Spielberg and movie of all time.STORYLINE: The storyline starts during Omaha Beach. Were we somewhat meet are hero's. Around 30 minutes in the actual story comes into play. Private James Ryan's (Matt Damon) 3 brothers are all killed in the line of duty. So Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and all of his crew are set to find him and bring him back home.CHARACTERS AND ACTING: The movie itself is powerful. The characters are smartly written. Because they question the mission. Why would 8 guys go over and save 1 man? Tom Hanks is as powerful as he ever is. He portrays his character of a man who has suffered during times of war. And his ""That's my mission"" speech always moved me. In short everyone does a great job.OTHER: This movie is powerful. And after watching it you want to take a shower and sing ""The Star Spangled Banner"" Because it is patriotic and it makes you feel proud. And of course the first 25 minutes of the movie is so incredibly well done that it makes shaky-cam look like a masterpiece! And this film is a masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Sensational..a must see,"Obviously you don't need me to tell you that, you probably already knew. Everything about this film was spectacular...The realism, the plot, the production value, the acting..etc all amazing. The characters are all unique and likable..with the exception of Upham(AKA the good guy you hate more than the bad guys) Several reasons for this: He's idiotic and doesn't understand war, he talks all this ""humanity, and what's right BS,"" but when it's time to kill an enemy easily and save a fellow comrad, he's too much of a coward. He also fails in the field because he was cowardice..Though he finally shot someone, it proved useless..it only said he was willing to kill, but kill an unarmed person at point blank.(which ironically makes him more of a coward.) Other than that all characters are cool. The mysterious Miller, the tough guy Carparzo, the jolly Harvath, the defiant Reiban, the great medic Wade, the great yet unfortunate Mellish, and my personal favorite, the cool religious sniper, Daniel Jackson. You can't help but fall into the story..I mean everything is done so exceptionally, it's no wonder why this is remembered as an all-time great.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I think this movie is perhaps the best war movie ever made,"I grew up in a tight knit Italian family, my father and several close uncles who all saw action in the Second World War, in fact when I was born my father was in Europe fighting. They were in the Marines, Army, Navy and one in the 101 airborne. Although none of them would speak of what they saw and did in any great detail, as they grew older they would from time to time discuss little bits and pieces. I can tell you from what I gleaned from their various conversations and having seen just about every war movie, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is as close as we privileged citizens are ever going to get to what it was really like. However, I believe it reality it was worse, yes worse than movie could make it. Remember, this was a 3 hour movie showing one incident, the reality is far worse, as the survivors of each incident did not go home, they got to fight again the next day/week/month/year, and so on, until the war was won of you were killed or wounded. The greatest generation, you bet. They made the world free, they did give up their tomorrows so we could have ours. If you don't agree and therefore do not honer, remember and celebrate these REAL American hero's, Than I say KMA and drop dead you UN-American SOB and go back to whatever hole you came from.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Greatest War Movie Ever Made,"This movie is not only one of the most historically accurate war films ever made, but is one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all time. The opening scene displaying the invasion of Omaha Beach on D-Day completely immerses you in the experience of war like nothing I've ever seen. I am a military veteran because of this movie. This movie inspired me to join the military at a young age. I enlisted at the age of 18 and made a career of it and wanted to model myself and the type of service member I would become after Captain Miller (Tom Hanks). This movie not only captures the raw realism of war, but also the connection and bond that the brotherhood of soldiers share. In my humble opinion, it is the greatest movie ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Horror of war, never more brutal","I had heard about the near 30 minute opening scene, how graphic and scary it was. I had actually dreamed about these scene before watching this film, and there an all too haunting identity to it. This was D day, a.k.a the battle of Normandy, where those small navy boats came onto the shores, and the soldiers were picked off like chickens at a shooting gallery. Many didn't make it ashore, where others that made it ashore, became bloody graphic examples of what this deadly and horrific war was like. This is the most scariest and bloodiest scene I've seen in a war film, where it's near thirty minute duration as it violently depicted what went down, in depth, highly benefited, but made the rest of the other film drop, or seem standard, but I mean that, only in contrast, to the war sequence, which really set the bar high, in one sense. The scene prior to this, in the cemetery, which comes back at the end, makes this story only the more heartbreaking, as we view a sea of graves, just to show you, how shockingly easy the lives of these boys were lost. Now moving on, Captain John Miller (Hanks) assigns a squad to track down one Private Ryan, risking the lives of his squad for this one guy. There are more shockingly violent bits in this too, the atmosphere in the last thirty, resembling that of the ruins in Full Metal Jacket, which unlike that, this one remarkably dodged an R certificate. What surprised me, acting wise, was Vin Diesel as one of Hanks squad, who unfortunately buys it early in the piece, while Hanks wasn't bad, but I have seen better from him, while Barry Pepper again steals their thunder. I like Ted Danson's brief performance too, as another squad captain we bump into on our search for that one party, where his two other brothers didn't make it. I'll be frank, SPR has a very unsettling and frightening aura to it, like I've never felt in any other war film. Another way of saying this, is in the how ""easy to die"" scenario which which I've never felt stronger as in this. Spielberg, again, has pulled off something respectfully and undeniably brilliant, but as someone who's created the most scariest war film, I've ever seen, he should be widely commended, where this film should of walked away with the best film Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Among the top war films of all time...,"SAVING PRIVATE RYAN stands alongside SCHINDLER'S LIST as one of Steven Spielberg's greatest achievements as a director. And just recently, I had the pleasure of re-discovering his EMPIRE OF THE SUN, and realized then how well he captures on film the horror and brutality of war without going in for stereotyped characters.During the '40s, when war films were largely produced for propaganda purposes and for injecting much needed patriotism into all Americans while we fought Hitler and Mussolini and the Japanese, we had films like A WALK IN THE SUN or GUADALCANAL DIARY or SO PROUDLY WE HAIL. All of them were fine, in their own way, but often resorted to creating Hollywood stereotypes among the characters, the soldiers and nurses who fought during the war.Not true here. From the startling twenty-minute opening sequence on the D-day invasion, through the intricacies of inter-personal relationships among a disparate group of men, we never once feel we're watching stereotypes but real people. All of the performances are first-rate, beginning with TOM HANKS, whose everyman personality is put to excellent use here. Others too numerous to mention do great jobs in the large supporting cast.No cheap heroics here, just a compelling war story, extremely well done and holding interest from beginning to end. Recommended highly.Trivia note: John Williams' score is never intrusive enough to damage the stark reality of some of the most brutal scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

This movie shows such feeling and pain and love it is unbelievable.Im so glad i watched this film because it has made me feel emotions i haven't felt whilst watching a film since Band Of Brothers, another powerful war film/TV show.

Apart from the violence and 'oh my God look how real this is' of the beach landings, we have just another average, how America won the war flick.

a manipulative collection of war film cliches,"The hype surrounding this film has been nothing short of ridiculous, since the film is nothing more than a host of hoary old war movie cliches slapped on a cornball plot that would have been right at home in the 50s. Total lack of character, particularly in Hanks' performance, which relies more on the viewer's perception of Hanks as an all-American guy rather than any kind of flesh and blood human. The film tries to have it both ways; war is horrible, but hey, we Americans are great and kick butt, especially against those Nazi scum. Total manipulation from a master; not that it would take much to root against the Nazis, but let's have it one way or the other: shades of gray, or black and white. Spielberg wants it both ways. And what about the cheap tactic of using the old veteran, who we later find out is Ryan, linking back to Tom Hanks' character? How about basic continuity, Steve? And the American flag at the beginning and end? It's as if Spielberg thinks the audience is too stupid to know which side to root for. One of the best movies ever made? Hardly.

The most gut-wrenching war movie I've ever seen.,"I've seen lot's of war movies in my 32 years of life, but this one is by far the only one that really, really affected me emotionally.  Watching this movie in the theatre, I had knots in my stomach.  The emotional impact of the film is something I had never experienced in such intensity.  The visuals were absolutely the best, music (while sometimes too melodramatic) was first rate, and the acting was mostly excellent.  I will admit that the movie did drag somewhat in the middle stages, but I'm glad it did because I needed the break!Many people here have said that this movie was not an anti-war movie.  Far from the truth.  Spielberg has shown what war REALLY IS form a soldiers point of view (witrh some creative liberties thrown in to be sure).  He shows us war for what it is...bloody, ugly, violent in the extreme, and most of the time has us wondering ""why?""  If anyone wants to rush off to war after seeing this film, you have some issues to deal with.  And is there something wrong with Spielberg showing soldiers as ""heroes?""  I didn't see that very much anyway, especially at the beginning...I saw ""good-guy"" soldiers shooting surrendered Germans..not very heroic, but most likely true.  In my opinion, EVERY single person of that generation that went ""over there"" was a hero, ugly consequences aside.And to the European crowd who cry about how ther were other nationalities that sacrificed and bled just as much as the ""noble Americans"" did...we know that.  Thats why they called it WORLD war 2.  This movie, however, focused on Omaha beach...the most heavily defended beach of D-Day.  Americans were there and they were slaughtered by the hundreds.  The Brits were over on another beach (Gold) with very little resistance, not the kind that the Americans experienced at Omaha in comparison.  This is not to take away the valiant sacrifices of your boys, but to put this mud-slinging in context here.  If you want a movie made about your sacrifices specifically, then make one.  But don't take away the fact that it was predominatly AMERICANS who bled and bled hard at Omaha.  The U.S. flag waving at the beginning and end?  Whats the big deal?  Ryan was an American soldier in the 101st airborne...what the heck ELSE was Spielgberg supposed to show??  The Union Jack??At any rate, this movie should be ranked as one of the greatest war movies of this century.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  World War 2 is not all old black-and-white combat footage you see in documentaries.  It's sacrifice, death, struggling, and heroics and rolled into one and chances are there is someone in your family who was over there.",,Anonymous,Drama

Saving Private Ryan (1998) - Spielberg in Action!,"Steven Spielberg's biggest hit to date is the epic war film, ""Saving Private Ryan"". The film follows around eight men in World War II, saving one soldier, whose three brothers were killed, and is the only brother alive. The film has powerful scenes of war and drama that teaches us the horror and drama of the war. Only Steven Spielberg, and his brilliant cast including Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, & Matt Damon, can bring an amazing motion picture that takes a deep step closer and closer until the film has its reaching point. Tom Hanks delivers one of his best performances of his whole career, Edward Burns was pretty impressive for his role, and Matt Damon had the shortest scenes in the whole movie, but those were good scenes. Steven Spielberg always delivers fine directing in all of his movie, but this one takes the cake. Everything about this movie, from the incredible cinematography, the intense film editing, to the explosive sound, ""Saving Private Ryan"" was one heck of a thrill. Though the war scenes were long and graphic, that does not stop the film's power. This film happens to be one of Spielberg's best movies yet. Also, the movie felt like a moving bio-diary of the many soldiers losing their lives in World War II. The movie felt personal, moving, emotional, and there are so many things to say about this movie, that I don't have time to say it all. This movie will always be a piece of history to me. Steven Spielberg really knows how to make a dramatic, well-acted war movie with a heart.

Spielberg puts us in the midst of war!,"You know why this is one of the best war films of all time? Because Spielberg puts us right in the midst of the war! We experience the unvarnished, direct, and all the nitty-gritty details that went on in battle. I can't think of any other film of the same genre which has done this. He does this by using shaky POV camera shots, showing us graphic images of soldiers getting blown up or getting shot, brutal sound effects, etc. We also get a solid storyline with an actual plot. Our heroes have a goal and a mission to complete (besides winning the war). After a grueling 20-minute opening that depicts the horrors that went on D-Day, Capt. Miller and his crew of soldiers are assigned to rescue private Ryan, a paratrooper lost behind enemy lines. His three brothers have just been killed in action and the Army wants to send him home. This leads Capt. Miller and his crew to undertake a dangerous task with an uncertain outcome.Tom Hanks and company are excellent. They all give convincing and rather low-key performances. Giovanni Ribisi and Matt Damon are particular standouts. Another thing I loved about the film was the pacing. The balance between the ghastly battle scenes and the quiet scenes which gives us time to get to know our heroes is perfect. You hardly notice that it's a 2 hr and 50 min film. The photography by Janusz Kaminski is incredibly distinctive. It has this ""washed-out"" look which makes it look like an old war newsreel. John Williams' musical score is also appropriately effective. It's not his most memorable nor as haunting like the one he did for Schindler's List but good enough to appreciate. Without a doubt, all this wouldn't have been achieved if it wasn't for Steven Spielberg's expertise. Once again, he shows us his versatility and mastery as a director to let audiences experience a story rather than just see it. I can live with the fact that the film didn't win an Oscar for Best Picture but it would have been an injustice if he hadn't won for Best Director.

For accuracy, blood, violence and length they are unmatched as far as my experience can say.

If you love movie battles then this is the film you've been waiting for.Some might call this film porn for action junkies but it is more than that. Beautifully shot and orchestrated, Saving Private Ryan is ultimately a tale of the men in combat rather than the combat itself.

The all star cast is fantastic.Saving Private Ryan starts with a World War II veteran bringing his family to the American cemetery at Normandy when he is overcome with emotion when visiting the graves of fellow soldiers who he served with. The film then flashes back to the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks in one of his best roles) leads the 2nd Ranger Battalion onto Omaha Beach to secure the beach and overcome the German defense amidst heavy casualties. While the opening 25 minute scene is unforgettable and excellently choreographed, this scene is a perfect depiction of the brutality of the horrors of war. It is realistically graphic and in no way glamorizes nor glorifies war unlike other movies.Meanwhile in Washington D.C. at the U.S. War Department, correspondence is being prepared to send to the various families notifying them of the loss of their loved ones during the war. In one of the saddest scenes of the movie in which you can't help but shed a tear, Mrs Ryan receives three letters on the same day notifying her that three of her sons were killed in action. A decision is made for the fourth son, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), to be located and sent home immediately.The mission to find Private Ryan is handed to Captain Miller and his squad which includes his second in command Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), the cynical machine gunner Private Rieben (Edward Burns), Jewish soldier Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), the deeply religious sniper Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), medic Private Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), Italian-American soldier Private Carparzo (Vin Diesel in an early role), and a skilled translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) who has not seen combat and finds himself bumbling throughout the mission and also resented by most of the squad members. The squad members find themselves questioning their mission to find one soldier and bring him home, but continue in their quest to locate Private Ryan as well as battling through numerous encounters with the German Army and confusion reigns as to whether Private Ryan is missing or presumably killed in action.The screenplay by Robert Rodat is excellent and cinematography by Janusz Kaminski perfectly captures the desaturated colour imagery of World War II. Steven Spielberg's eye for detail as well as the ability to bring out the emotional side of viewers is highly admirable. The cast, particularly Tom Hanks as Captain Miller as an everyman thrust into action as the leader of men is excellent and he makes this role his own. Matt Damon as the young Private James Ryan must also be highly commended. The rest of the cast such as Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel and Jeremy Davies shine in their respective outstanding roles.Also in the all star cast, Dennis Farina (a well known character actor who sadly passed away in 2013), Paul Giamatti (another character actor known for comedic roles), Bryan Cranston (before his famous role as Walter White in Breaking Bad), and Ted Danson (best known for TV shows Cheers and Becker) pop up in small roles in Saving Private Ryan.Saving Private Ryan is one of the few emotionally powerful movies that is capable of making grown men shed a tear, despite many unwilling to openly admit it. There are a few scenes, particularly the ending that evoke the emotional side of many viewers.Saving Private Ryan deserved its widespread critical acclaim and success at the box office. It also garnered numerous awards and Steven Spielberg was a well deserved winner, but in a complete travesty was unfairly robbed of the 1998 Best Picture Academy Award. Why Saving Private Ryan missed out on the Best Picture Academy Award I'll never know.Saving Private Ryan exhibits Steven Spielberg's finest movie to date, and this is certainly a very memorable movie for Tom Hanks. I take my hat off to Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks for their fantastic work in this movie. A lot of people say that Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies of all time due to its realistic depiction of the horrors of World War II. I wholeheartedly agree that it truly deserves its recognition as the best war movie of all time, and rightfully so.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"This film rocks, closest i have seen to a 'in ya face' war experience.","This is a truly awesome film in terms of special effects and it really makes you feel like you are in the action. This is the closest i have seen to any war film in getting you feeling you are actually their, sounds special effects and visual experience is superb (although the video footage quality on DVD doesn't look so good on a larger screen for some reason).Excellent DVD demo disk, the landing sequence at the beginning is simply breath-taking and really shows you what they went through. The use of sound is amazing, with bullets whistling past you ..""Band of brothers"" is pretty much the same but slower in pace due to the TV series length.Verdict:- Fantastic, a must own Film to showcase visual effects and surround sound systems.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Best war movie ever...best movie ever?  I think so.,"There really is no need to discuss what goes on in this film, since all of the world has seen it 10 times over.  Tom Hanks is possibly the greatest actor of my generation, I being 26 when the film was released.  Thomas Sizemore is one of my favorite actors, despite always being a supporting actor.  No question, that this is the greatest war movie ever created, and it will take something VERY special to steal that crown away.  As far as I'm concerned it was the best movie that I've ever seen to date.  Obviously I gave it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tom Hanks outsmarts Col. Klink,"Tom Hanks and Co. sneak across battlefields to bring home the titular private, while staying one step ahead of Col. Klink and Sgt. Schultz.This has to be the most over rated film in recent history. The Germans are portrayed so flatly that they may as well have saved money on actors and used cardboard stand-ups. But check out how kind hearted those U.S. soldiers are! They spare the life of an enemy!! They risk a dozen men for the life of one, who may not even be alive!! What?? Are these tears on my keyboard as I type this?This film is one that *appears* to be portraying humanity at it's lowest and highest...but in reality it is a sham, perpetrated by a Spielbergian wizard, pulling his levers behind a curtain of propaganda. At it's best, this movie is a pro-war advertisement masquerading as patriotism for humanity. At it's worst...well, look around, you're soaking in it.I'd refer anyone who is interested to read Howard Zinn's essay in his book ""Howard Zinn On War"". He talks a bit against this movie in a way I could never do, because he was there.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tom Hanks at his best,"This is one of many of my favorite Tom Hanks movies and also Steven Spielberg's too. This is movie is rated as the best war movie ever made and I felt same after watching this movie.The especialty of this movie is the characters in the movie and all the actors played their part with par excellence. The movie is very much able to show the grief of the mothers and families. Major attraction of the movie also includes the combat scenes from the movie.Although people can say that Tom Hanks character as the lead or main role of the movie but I say that all characters were major in this movie and that was because Steven Spielberg distributed the screen space so well between all the characters of the movie that you never feel that any of the character is left out or suppressed.Tom Hanks character is filled of different shades where he shows his intelligence with some brilliant strategy to win the battle at the coast then at the same character can seen weeping in the middle of battle field remembering his life post the war.The dialogs in the movie are also very touching. I personally really liked the scene when the Army supreme (don't remember much about him) reads out a letter by president ""Abraham Lincoln"" showing condolence to the a mother who lost all of her kids in the war for the nation.If you have not seen this movie due to any reason then I would recommend you to buy a DVD and watch it with whole family.",,Anonymous,Drama
The ideal Memorial Day movie,"Whenever Memorial Day rolls around, I think of the countless men in this country who fought and gave their lives to liberate Europe from evil forces. This one movie is the perfect example of the sacrifices made, yet for all the excitement, it shows the consequences of war as well, as seen through the eyes of Captain Miller, wonderfully played by Tom Hanks, as he sees his fellow soldiers whether storming the beach at Normandy or partaking in a dangerous mission to rescue one man with a small group of skilled men after hearing the man's brothers perished already. As the mission unfolds, tempers flare, egos clash, priorities are challenged and of course lives are lost. You will feel the impact of war as you watch it and see the people you connect with feel pain or get killed. Will the mission be a success? That's for you to find out.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Owns,"This movie owns.. I've watched it over 20 different times, and every time, my heart is racing! They need to make another one like this! I really like the first part, the whole Rushing up the beach and all that is sweet as hell! but the best battle, by far in this movie, is the last battle, with the bridge and the Alamo and the sniper! Lol that one guy(the runner guy) is so scared all the time .. its great! and some information about the guys in here! they are all 2nd rangers, obviously, but, that runner is in the 29th Infantry Division ..

Wow. This is the best war movie of all time.,"This movies opening scene is one of the most brutal, horrific, yet accurate representations of war I have seen. This scene sets the mood for the whole movie. While the rest of the movie is not quite as intense, it quickly involves you in the characters and you sympathize with them because of what they have endured. You truly care for them and are interested in their well being. The realization that what they have experienced is only the beginning of the story is a grim one indeed. The war is not over, and thus it is not finished shaping the men in focus. They will be molded and formed in innumerable ways as the war takes a hold of their psyche and their lives. In conclusion, I believe this is the best war movie of all time and one of if not Steven Spielberg's best films.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A gripping and poignant war epic,"""Saving Private Ryan,"" directed by Steven Spielberg, is a cinematic tour de force that offers a harrowing and unforgettable portrayal of World War II. Set against the backdrop of the D-Day invasion, the film follows Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his squad as they embark on a dangerous mission to find and bring home Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers have been killed in action.Spielberg's direction is masterful, capturing the chaos and brutality of war with unflinching realism. The opening sequence depicting the Omaha Beach landing is widely regarded as one of the most intense and visceral portrayals of combat ever put to film.The ensemble cast delivers exceptional performances, with Tom Hanks anchoring the film with his portrayal of Captain Miller. The camaraderie and bond formed between the members of Miller's squad feel genuine and deeply affecting.Beyond its gripping action sequences, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a poignant exploration of sacrifice, duty, and the human cost of war. Its themes resonate long after the credits roll, making it a timeless classic that continues to leave a lasting impact on audiences.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Timeless,"The brilliantly directed, Spielberg World War Two epic, Saving Private Ryan(1998) completely redefines combat action films up until this point. Whether you are one for extreme realism, or just like to watch things blow up, this movie is the epitome of all things good and pure in war movies. There is no compromise in this film, it seamlessly joins drama and action to form a movie that mom and dad would like. It follows a rag tag but elite squad of Army rangers through their historical landing on Omaha beach in Normandy France, to their journey to find and bring home Private Ryan ( Matt Damon) of the 101st airborne. Their mission was to find and retrieve Damon, and send him back to the United States after the tragic news of his three brothers dying in combat. The army thought the loss too great for his mother to bear. However, this was a reoccurring point in the movie, is the life of one worth the lives of many? The squad leader (Tom Hanks) delivers an Oscar- nominated performance that is unforgettable while acting side by side with Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Mike Horvath and Edward Burns as Private Richard Reiben.The movie left me wanting more war movies of the same quality, immediately recognizing the world class directing, cinematography and editing. The emotion and intensity is captured by the shaky camera shots, to the low and high angle pans of the battle scenes and really brought home with the close up of the character's grief and pain. The directing really made this film; it not only enthralled the viewer during the movie, but powerful scenes left the viewer thinking long after the film was over. No matter how I describe the intricacies that make this picture great, none do more justice and give more description than just one word, Spielberg; the credibility is in the name. Sure enough, as credit is given where it is due the movie received five Oscars three of them being Best Director (Steven Spielberg), Best Cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and Best Editing (Michael Kahn). It also won Oscars for Best Effects and Sound Effects, as well as Best Sound.I would recommend this movie to anyone. If you're the ardent movie critic or just an average Joe, there is something that we can all appreciate about this film and leave with the same expression, ""Wow."" This piece of art is nothing less than the silver screen at its best; I give this film two thumbs up (more if I was humanly capable) and my full approval.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I'd rate it 12...,"Saving Private Ryan is the most vivid film watching experience I have ever witnessed. I have never been quite so impacted by a film.First and foremost, every actor from Vin Diesel to Matt Damon gives it their all in this film. I truly felt as if the soldiers were human and their experiences were literally being documented.Secondly, it is genuinely in the top 3 most well edited films I have ever watched. The gritty, dark, and especially gruesome bookended action sequences are very likely to leave a mark on you.Thirdly, it pays tribute to the courageous soldiers who fought during the war. Some may say that this is an
'anti-war' film. In my humble opinion, it is more of a film that dedicates itself to honoring those who fought on
D-Day and everything after.10/10 but I'd give it 12.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
My view on the film,"Phew, where do you start? A film that shows at last what bullets and bombs do to the human body. A film that shows that war is not about glory and seeing off a few of the enemy before getting home for tea. It makes me wonder how those men stayed sane when they got home, IF they got home. I found the film compelling and very, very disturbing. All too many American blockbuster films show people blazing away and the nasty men meeting their fate,but this one I believe is as close as a film has got to getting anywhere near the truth, if the vets accounts are anything to go by. And if it is, then I'm bloody glad I wasn't 18 in 1944...The most moving part of the film for me was when the troop attacked some kind of radar installation, on the way to finding Private Ryan. After the attack one chap lies there with bullet holes in his chest, whilst his mates try and help him. Slowly he starts slipping away, and cries out for his mother, and his home. It's a scene that's still with me, weeks after seeing the movie. Another splendid side of the film for me was that there wasn't a clean cut, gung - ho, invincible hero to be seen...just normal, ordinary, and very scared men.Any flaws? Well, for me personally, the very end was a little too sentimental, but that's the directors trade mark, I suppose. All in all, a terrific, pulsating, horrific and terrifying film from my point of view. I don't think I'll ever look at an old man in quite the same way again.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A visual experience 10 years later,"I saw this when it was first released in 1998 and wrote a review which for some reason never got posted. 500 films later, and seeing Tarantino's very idiosyncratic war movie, ""Inglourious Barsterds"" I was reminded of this one, where the story is played absolutely straight in a way to give the average American patriot goosebumps. Yet the rescuing of Sergeant Ryan (Matt Damon) is actually a cynical effort by the High Command to boost morale which puts eight brave men into jeopardy. Spielberg's battle scenes are really something – ten years later I still vividly recall the first 20 minutes on the Normandy beach – the audience is put right in it. Other than that I remember a vivid fire fight in a ruined French village and the final scene 40 years later. I had to be reminded that it was Tom Hanks who led the rescue team (I do recall Vin Diesel in it too), so the acting didn't leave much impression. The actors were overpowered by all the action.Perhaps comparing this blockbuster with Tarantino is not fair, Both films entertain in there own way – Spielberg, who gives us splendid visuals, is utterly conventional and offends very few viewers and Tarantino does things his own way and doesn't care who he offends (though he does not make light of atrocity). Has the second world war movie run its course? Even if the answer is ""yes"" we have not seen the end of war movies in general. As long as there are wars there will be movies about them. ""Ryan"" at least tells a coherent story, and survival stories are usually both pretty gripping and mildly uplifting. Tarantino, on the other hand is inclined toward nihilism, but he does have fun getting there. Spielberg is more hard work, but ""Ryan"" has to be one of his better films.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Righteous, Embellishing, and slightly Jingoistic","Any movie that opens with a lengthy shot of the American flag has got problems.In general, I thought it superficial, poorly written and poorly directed. Spielberg has a penchant for thrusting his movies upon his viewers, spoon -feeding them morality in doses of banal righteousness. I personally don't go to the movies to be treated like a schoolkid and taught a lesson so elementary, vague, and though ultimately true, trite.Those who see Saving Private Ryan as a revelatory view of war obviously slept through High School History. War is gruesome, war isn't fun, war sucks. Glad to see the truth Spielberg, but dizzying freehand camera shots, pointless music (the music sucked throughout), and timed successions of loud booms gave me more of a headache than visceral enlightenment. About 5 minutes into the D-Day scene, when the cacophony of camera shots and dead bodies reached its apogee, I asked myself:  ""Why did Spielberg put this in? Did he have any real reason except to embellish the gruesomeness of war? Does this really contribute to the movie?"" I found the answer to be no.Then there's the plot and characters ... wait, what plot and characters? Here are 8(?) men meandering through French territory wondering why they are all such damn stereotypical and superficial characters. There's the bookworm, the Italian, the Southerner, the Jew, etc. In the end I can't feel very much for any of these characters  cause they're not even human to me; they're typecasts. Even Tom Hanks (who does a worthy job), remains distant and emotionally inaccessible (due to poor writing). (So we know that his hand shakes and he teaches English. BFD) Spielberg could take a lesson from, say, John Sayles, about character development.Then there's the plot. From the title, I expected there to be more focus on Saving Private Ryan. Instead, the group wanders through Normandy and the hunt for Ryan becomes unimportant and adventitious. The movie's impetus is seriously lacking, and I accredit this to poor directorial focus. Spielberg had problems finding a point to direct the energy of the war to, and instead directed it towards some vague moral standard. Unlike, say, Apocalypse Now, where the search for Brando has a singular focus on him, the soldiers wander aimlessly and haphazardly stumble upon Ryan in the most obtuse and anticlimatic fashion possible. On their way they go through a perfectly crafted sine curve of battles and traumas, discoveries and enlighenments. And as soon as I saw Ted Danson I couldn't help but drift to place where everybody knows your name and guys in pasty blue uniforms named Cliff down Heneiekens. Now THAT'S poor focus.In the end I could predict flatly what would happen. Yes, it's a true story, so Spielberg was limited, but the presentation was just too flat. The ending  is so utterly pitiful and righteous I wanted to puke. ""So, this is what the movie came down to?"" I thought as the American flag waved me goodbye. ""War is bad. America is good. Death is bad. Life is good. "" Drink Bud.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
"good opening, goes downhill from that","Well, the movie starts off with a credible depiction of D-Day, not shying away from the insane violence and carnage. very shocking and puts you right in the middle of WW2 combat. Unfortunately the movie goes downhill from there. The production quality is still on a high-level,but the story itself isn`t. Spielberg is too fond of his hollywood-type heroism, and spices his otherwise gritty tale with unecessary blandness. The worst part is the display of the german troops. They are displayed as mindless thugs and not as humans. Even much older movies like ""Battle for Arnheim"", portray germans in a more acceptable way.Enemies like the Japanese,Germans,Vietkong and later on the Russians (former WW2 Allies !) are always shown in US-Warmovies as pure Cannonfodder for the Americans.Back to ""Ryan"". Spielberg has a fixed mindset about germans, probably heavily influenced by the comic-book nazis of his own ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". (which is a good and entertaining movie btw.) He doesn`t trust his story and thinks he has to pump it up with some patriotic music and ""heroic"" dialogue.Just terrible. I was very dissapointed. Why is it not possible to make a movie at least trying to show both sides, from a soldiers perspective ?ah well...",,Anonymous,Drama

A necessary lesson.,"I won't summarise the film or talk about its technical and artistic brilliance. It is a brilliant film which depicts WW2 as it was, not the sanitised versions we were used to seeing from the 50s onwards. But, to me, there is a more important lesson to be gained from this film...I went to see this film in a suburban cineplex here in Australia. On the night there was a huge audience and a large group of teenagers who'd wandered in because the film they wanted to see had a full house (I overheard them saying this...). They were boisterous and noisy and sometimes obnoxious as kids can sometimes be at cinemas. But after the first five minutes of the film they were dead silent and they remained so for the rest of the film.I looked at their faces as they exited the theatre at the end of the film. All were ashen-faced, drained...some clearly close to tears. I was happy about this because a film had hammered home to a bunch of modern kids the reality of war without them having to experience it first hand, thank God. All at once they learned that war is horrible, sometimes necessary and best avoided. I'm sure they learned to look at the elderly survivors of this time in human history with a new-found respect. In short, they grew up considerably and without any physical pain as a result of watching this masterful film. And for that, I thank Spielberg profusely. Bravo, Sir.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
