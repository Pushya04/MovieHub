Great,"I realize this movie came out 18 years ago, but I wasn't on IMDb then. Did IMDb even exist? I don't know. But as I'm sitting in the barbershop right now, this movie is being played on the tv right now, and I'm reminded how much I love this movie. In my opinion, one of the best comedies ever made. I know it's not for everyone (I have friends who hate it), but it's a classic to myself and some others I know. Excellent writing and acting.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Master Storytellers,"Those Coen brothers' movies really do grown on you. I had just seen Fargo when I rented this. It is one of the most creative, off the wall films I have ever seen. As these characters bumble their ways after a prison break, they are embraced by a series of the most unconventional personages ever to hit filmdom. And one gets turned into a frog--sort of. their flirtations with fame, the Klan, a cyclops, and all the other episodes, make this a hilarious romp. George Clooney's Ulysses is an obsessive, full speed ahead, damn the torpedoes, coupled with the charming half-wittedness of his fellow travelers, works at every level. Like Greek poetry, he is butting heads with the gods, but despite setbacks, keeps moving. It is story telling with charm and a load of bull. Everyone is some kind of philosopher, but the words come out of gap toothed, shaved headed hillbillies. And, of course, Clooney has hell to pay. I could watch this over and over again. And then there's the really cool music. I didn't even mention that!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
This film brought back memories.,"We lived through the depression and related to some of the conditions portrayed. We have watched it perhaps a dozen times. Each time we see it we pick up on something we had missed because we were still laughing at, or discussing, an earlier scene or line. The entire film was a collection of photographically great faces. We are still asking ourselves whether the entire cast were professionals or whether some were individuals found on location. The film was rich with subtle tie-ins like the children tied together with twine, as the prisoners were connected by chains. We still think the cow may have been hit unintentionally. Fords of that era had mechanical brakes. The driver of the car may not have been accustomed the longer stopping distances required. The many allusions to Ulysses Odyssey inspired us to do an inter-net search. We found a modern text version and discovered more sly references. We appreciate blue grass and country music as originally American and found it thoroughly enjoyable, along with the authentic ""Go To Sleep Little Baby"" and ""Down from the Mountain."" We were emotionally touched by this film because of our age, and find it totally entertaining every time we view it. We are still amazed that someone not of our generation could have captured the essence of that period of United States history.",,Anonymous,Crime
"surprising, refreshing and hilarious","Thank goodness for the Coen Brothers. Their success has brought them bigger budgets,but hasn't rid them of their creativity. I had planned on seeing another movie, but it was sold out so I went to this one instead. By the time it began, I had forgotten what movie I was there to see. I was surprised in more ways than one. This movie is hilarious, but they don't make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs. The writing is brilliant, and delivered with great skill by George Clooney (after this, nobody can say he's just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. It can be appreciated on many levels, whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was this clever. I've seen others I would describe as beautiful, intriguing, funny and charming, all of which also describe ""Oh Brother,"" but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end. You can feel that their journey is building up to something, but you can't tell what. And the Coen brothers do not fail us, the end is certainly not disappointing. It's surprising, and ties up all the loose ends neatly, without wearing the story out.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Serious Comedy with wonderful characters,"The Coen Brothers have truly outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts. Though it is based on ""The Odyssey,"" the ancient work of Homer, you do not have to have read ""The Odyssey"" to be able to follow the story. The brothers Coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights! The soundtrack is intrinsic to the film, indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper. Each character is wonderfully exploited and harkens back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness, texture and authenticity. George Clooney is magnificent as the grease haired Everett Ulysses McGill, a honest con on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing. O Brother, Where Art Thou is easily the best Coen film to date as well as Clooney's best effort. Clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of the dimwitted friend Delmar, while the film itself is deserving of a Best film nod.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hillbilly hi-jinks. Bluegrass music. Laugh out loud funny!,"The Coen Brothers have done it again. Three depression era convicts(George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson)escape a Mississippi chain gang and head off in search of buried treasure that will fund their new lives. Along the way, they sing on the radio and become much sought after stars as well as escapees. Great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson/introduction to bluegrass music.Clooney is outstanding as the fast talking, quick witted Ulysses Everett McGill. Holly Hunter plays his estranged wife. Turturro and Nelson are flawless stumblebums. Also in the cast are John Goodman and Charles Durning.Dan Tyminksi provides the singing voice for George Clooney on ""I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow"", the Soggy Bottom Boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, The Whites, John Hartford, The Cox Family and Gillian Welch. Toe tapping, knee slapping fun for the whole family. You'll be surprised with how relaxed and funny this movie is.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pretty darn good,"Having seen most of the Coen Brothers previous films I expected something different and slighty off centre. OBWAT is certainly those things, but it also has a heart as big as..well..as big as Mississippi. It is one of the most plainly enjoyable movies to have come out in recent times, intelligent, well-crafted, clever and superbly acted.Characters are delivered in their myriad shades by a group of marvellous actors. George Clooney winning me over completely with his Clark Gable-ish looks and character. Having only ever seen him in Three Kings and his Thin Red Line cameo, I am now a fan. More comedy please George.John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson ably assist, especially Nelson. If ever ""The Simpsons"" is made into a movie then he must be a natural to play Cletus the slack-jawed yokel. I don't think there is a performance that falls short of excellent from the entire cast. My special favorite is Stephen Root as the blind Radio Station Man.Great old-timey music, a jiggy type dance by Clooney that I am trying to learn, and a feel of depression era southern US enhanced by sepia-like photography make this the best movie I've see  so far this century. The only drawback to the film is that it has almost sent me broke buying the soundtrack, the DVD and a DVD player to play it on....it's THAT good!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Looking for logic where there is none.,"There is a line in O Brother, Where Art Thou? that sums up not just the consensus view of this movie, but also that of nearly every Coen Brothers production. George Clooney says to his chained counterpart John Turturro, ""It's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart."" Indeed, there may never have been a better and more meaningful statement uttered. For that sums up the total outlook Joel and Ethan have given to us ever since their stunning debut in 1984 with Blood Simple.Although this is not a new concept for them, I think these themes work really well with the setting of this movie, one of the most original in remembrance. Here, we get the story of Homer's The Odyssey set in the 1930s of the American South as three bumbling ex-cons search for a treasure while encountering many obstacles along the way. However, like many a Coen Brothers movie, the plot is just a spot to hang up the arc of the story in order to give way for the really interesting aspects; here being the idiosyncrasies of the characters, the gorgeous wide-screen photography, and the overall crass view of human existence.Through all this, there is a great amount of fun and joy in this story. Clooney is the fast-talking, slick leader of this weirdly likable trio and despite many believing he is too good looking and polished for the role, I believe that only adds to his repertoire, for this Everett needs to be a fast-talker in order to be taken serious because of his looks. Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson add comic support but also depth with their portrayals of Pete and Delmar, chained to Everett and loyal followers the whole way. Even with the clever writing and shifty characters, there is something of a heart behind this story as well as the typical cynicism of the Coens.This is certainly the type of movie that grows on you and multiple viewings are needed not necessarily to understand the plot but to capture the tone and message of the movie; if there is one. Still, if nothing else, one can certainly appreciate the intelligent/stupid mixture of humor the Coens are capable of mixing together so well. Clooney, Turturro and Nelson are wonderful in their respectable roles and of course, Roger Deakins perfectly captures the feeling of the old South with his colorful and rich cinematography. Here is a great looking, fast talking, clever movie with not much of a message. With the Coens in charge, what is the problem?",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great Music, But Drags A Bit","I know I may get a bit of flack because this is a Coen Brothers film and it is an interesting take on The Odyssy, but I couldn't help but find myself checking the clock from time to time.

It will grow on you,"I have walked out of a Coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that I had to like it. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Still, I liked the film and now own a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics, sometimes I wasn't sure why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry, but nonetheless I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but upon further investigation, they were really just real people talking about real situations. That is why the man with the shovel ( or was it a broom ) was so side-splittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. And that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. (I own a copy of this film too) The Coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. But if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany, you will always find that in some strange way, they all ring true. That is what is quite exceptional about O Brother Where Art Thou? This is a film that is out there. I mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. I reviewed the film Shaft this past summer and in it I said that Shaft was an okay film that I have seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Coen Brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one.This film has everything in it from a jail break, crooked southern politicians, muses, references to what I can only assume are historical figures, riverside baptisms, bank robberies, violence towards animals, singing flocks of religious fanatics, KKK, lynch mobs and so on. There are obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey in here as well, but I wouldn't know that because I have never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spoof-like quality towards it makes the film that much better. Well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it, I can tell you that it is still an entertaining film. There were times when again, as is usual for a Coen film, I wasn't sure why I was entertained or laughing, but I was.This is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates. He has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape.I like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are Coen cronies. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in every Coen film. It's too bad they didn't find a place for Steve Buscemi but that is a different story all together. But back to Clooney. The man just has charisma. He is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is quite awesome and I really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character.Now after heaping all this praise on the film, let me just say this as well. I didn't really enjoy the film at first. I found it to be quite tedious and a little boring. There were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth. But then the film began to grow on me. It took a while but it did grow on me. I don't think this is their best film, but it is still a good one and I am giving it a 8.5. But the reason that I do recommend this film is for one reason only.Every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself, seen it, seen it, oh, seen it last year, that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film. Most films have been recycled in some form or another. Not the Coen's films. They have not been recycled and if they have I don't know about it. That is reason enough to see something that they put out. Originality counts for a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And that is not common in todays cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make films. Because you don't get vision like this in many films, so when you do, enjoy it!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Handsome production, but awkward, detached serio-comedy isn't too funny...","Terrific production and a good comedic performance by George Clooney can't save curiously detached, occasionally clumsy quasi-comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen. Depression-era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain-gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune, and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process! The film meanders along but never builds any momentum. It does get a big boost from Clooney's charismatic, Gableesque mugging, and also from the art direction and T-Bone Burnett's lively music. Otherwise, the screenplay (by the Coens) is seriously lacking in humor and interest, supporting cameos by John Goodman and Holly Hunter fail to add any lift, and the second-half of the movie slides precariously into self-indulgence. ** from ****",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
You get it or you don't,"One of the finest pieces of story telling ever to hit celluloid.  The performances are so perfect and dead-on, and the nuances so subtle, that this movie defies description.  It is no wonder that the reviews you read run the gamut from ""piece of junk"", to ""superb"" to just plain confused. This is a must-see movie, and from there you're on your own, you have to decide for yourself.  Note, however, that this film follows its own course -- *loosely* based on Ulysses, and with its own symbolism, characters, and themes.  To spot them all you will need to watch carefully, think constantly, and, in all likelihood, see the film many times more than once. Not to worry, it improves with each viewing.",,Anonymous,Crime
My Favorite Coen Brothers Film,"As I write I find myself wondering why this one gets me laughing so hard and I think it's for a lot of reasons. The first is that there is something hilarious to me about adapting a story like ""The Iliad,"" a Classic (in the Greek foundational principles sense of the word) High Myth Hero's Journey, and setting it in the deep south during the great depression. There couldn't be anything less grand than that.The other thing I find so funny are the characters. Between the three of them, Everett (George Clooney, ""Burn After Reading"") Pete (John Turturro, ""Barton Fink"") and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson, ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"") are each one of them hilarious on their own but the interplay between them is priceless.Everett is the fast talking knowledgeable man of the world, always scheming and angling for what will give him an edge. He may be knowledgeable but he's not always right or even trying to be right. He's just trying to get his own way and facts, exaggerations, stories, and quickly spoken half truths are his way of doing it.Pete is easily out matched by Everett because while he may have a better sense of what is just and looks out for what is fair and right, he is also dumb. As such, Everett almost always gets away with whatever he wants and Pete is left continually frustrated in his attempts to make sure he isn't getting the short straw.Delmar is dumb as well but sweet. He wants everyone to just get along and is always looking to be helpful. Of course, as Everett, Pete and pretty much any other person they run into is always looking to pull one over on each other, this puts him in the awkward position of never really knowing whose side to be on, since he's on everyone's side.This trio of silliness leads to some of the funniest back and forth conversations, shouting matches, and name calling I've ever seen on screen.The last thing that makes this movie really funny to me, and I know this is controversial, is the southern drawl of every character in this film. My Grandmother was originally from Arkansas and while her accent has much diminished over the 35 years I've known her, it was very strong to me when I was younger. I always thought it was funny that she referred to Meijer (a local grocery chain) as 'Maars."" For me, a southern accent is both funny and fond when I hear it so I know some people may not get the same feeling from this film as I do but for me it is a perfect combination to go with the themes of the movie.The themes in this film are certainly Coen Brother classics. The values of brotherhood, family, sacrifice, and hard work, with edges of fate, the supernatural, or karmic justice are ever present in their films but the way they blend it with that southern gospel and dry dust working man mentality cuts through strong in this film. It isn't lost on me that the three leads in this film form a close bond, the film is called ""O BROTHER, Where Art Thou,"" and it was directed by the Coen BROTHERS. As a brother myself I can attest to the spirit of camaraderie that can form between siblings and this film oozes with it. There is nothing like the bond that can form between people when they journey together and seem to meld into one person in three bodies almost.The last thing I will extol in this film is the music. I leave it for last because it is the best. Old time twang and southern gospel in its many forms. Upbeat and praise filled, down low and mournful, and wistful longing for a home that is not yet ours. It is used for good and evil alike and the solace of those broken by life and their fellow human beings as well as the joy in the hearts of children still ignorant of life's troubles. There are many songs in this film that feels as if you might have been able to hear them on any summer evening as you drove by the porches of families all gathered outside to enjoy the cool breeze accompanying the setting sun.Perhaps that is what I, actually, love the most about this film. The sense of coming home after hard times away. The belief that, while family is worth everything, close friends are often the crucible through which we are refined and make us better people for our families when we do get home and join them. The journey is not the destination, but it does change us and make us into the people who will arrive there.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Masterful...,"Not being a fan of the Coen Brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see the skepticism I took into the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something different. This time it was those zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) Coens doing ""their thing"" to one of the great works in literary history. Who would've ever thought Homer had this in mind? I don't know where this film is going to fit in the history books of Hollywood, but it will be in both mine and many others DVD or VHS library. It is one of those films that you can watch over and over. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and entertaining, with a couple of Gumpesque brushes with fame, great performances by Clooney, Turturro, Nelson, and a brief but hilarious Holly Hunter.

"Mixed Emotions Message-Wise, But Extremely Entertaining","This may be the only film that is blatantly anti-Christian that I still give a high rating, simply because it was so entertaining. Hopefully, some of the religious digs were tongue-in-cheek and not meant in a mean-spirited way, but I'm not sure, especially considering who made it.I DO know this was fun to watch and hear, except for the excessive usage of the Lord's name in vain with George Clooney as the main culprit. The music in here is super, led by the catchy ""Man Of Constant Sorrow,"" performed by Gary Tyminski. I also loved ""Soggy Mountain Boys"" humorously sang and presented by the three main characters: Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. Those three guys were hilarious, particularly Nelson with his rubber-faced looks. Audibly, the entire soundtrack is outstanding, under the direction of T-Bone Burnett. I wound up buying the CD as millions of other people did. Fantastic music.The way this was filmed makes it visually fascinating, with scenery enhanced by computer graphics and all-time great Roger Deakins in charge of the photography. All the people in this movie are wacky, as are the people who made it: the unfortunately clever-but-biased Coen brothers.

20th Anniversary!,"""O Muse! Sing in me, and through me tell the story of that man skilled in all the ways of contending, a wanderer, harried for years on end.""Sirens, cyclops, oracles, villains, and heroes from ancient Greece assume new forms in 1930s Mississippi in this whimsical, brilliant, funny, and deeply American Odyssey.Three prisoners on a work crew escape into the countryside. While the iron chain that binds them is soon broken, it is replaced by a stronger bond, friendship. This new link is tested repeatedly and relentlessly by a diabolical sheriff, Klansmen, con men, scheming relatives, alluring women, charred gopher, bad hair and other monstrosities, but luck, desperation, a talent for music and the inveterate resourcefulness of the trio gets them out of much of the trouble that their impulsiveness leads them into. Deeper problems are their own demons. The unlikely companions travel across Mississippi in search of a treasure that proves illusory, but a much more valuable fortune awaits.O Brother, Where Art Thou is a thick slice of Americana. Much of this comes from the bluegrass soundtrack. I fell in love with the sound along with singer Gillian Welch. Cinematographer Roger Deakins is at the height of his creative powers as he brews something modern and antique at the same time. His images are a little grainy and blurry, which gives them the historical feel, but the composition and quality do not suffer for it. One of the best things about the writing and directing of the Coen brothers is balance. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, good and bad, flaws and noble aspects, and this is in accord with human nature. The stories told by the Coens are drenched in truth and authenticity. Actors George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman and Holly Hunter are perfectly cast and amazing in their roles. I laughed so hard I lost my breath when Delmar (Nelson) was convinced the sirens turned his friend into a toad, and when Big Dan (Goodman) squishes it. There is satisfactory depth to the film with its references to the Odyssey, the themes of racial harmony, love and politics, the beautiful images and more.

The film includes characters or places with the stereotypes of the regions they take place in , as the Southern accents and dust-bowl landscape from Mississippi . The whole concept is loosely based on author Howard Waldrop's novella ""A Dozen Tough Jobs,"" which recounts the labors of Hercules in a similar Mississippi setting , albeit ten years earlier ; another possible link comes from the William Faulkner short novel, ""Old Man"" . Sympathetic acting by main stars accompanied by a magnificent plethora of secondaries as Charles Durning , Thomas King , Ray McKinnon , Lee Weaver , Ed Gale , Stephen Root , Musetta Vander , as well as Coen regulars as John Goodman and special mention for John Turturro .

"A great sound, a great look, and a great story.","I was into the movie right away.  I've seen the other Coen movies, with the exception of Raising Arizona, and I've noticed that each of their movies has a color.  Fargo is gray/white, Lebowski is bright orange, and this movie is a pleasant yellow.The bright pleasant qualities of this movie start right away.

Has moments,"Earnest effort which achieves some success to adapt the classic Odyssey story to a '30's nostalgia period piece. The adventurers this time are escaped convicts, wandering about the Depression afflicted South bungling their way into trouble.The greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack, effectively evoking not only the era that this is set in, but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film. Besides its value to the tone of the movie, the music is just plain fun to listen to.What cripples the film is that the characters really aren't that likable. In a comedy, you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their misadventures. Instead, we have a bunch of selfish, arrogant, soulless, mean spirited nobodies who really have no positive points at all. They're not imposing enough to make you hate them either, so it's hard to relate to them at all. They're offered up as clowns, but like people who put clown makeup on and march in parades, they just aren't funny.Like the story that inspired it, the movie takes these guys on an ""odyssey,"" encountering a variety of symbolic (some even mystical) characters. Everybody is stamped with offensive stereotypes, the operative word being ""stupid."" People are mocked right and left, and consequently, no one is left being particularly interesting or appealing. The movie doesn't like its own characters, and it doesn't let you like them, either.Riverside baptisms, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fistfights, radio preachers, people being whipped with sticks; all are thrown at you in disjointed fashion. Some evoke a few laughs, others confuse or bore you. I did laugh when a nerdy guy beat the snot out of an especially obnoxious lead character. But there were a lot more pointlessly gratuitous scenes; an example: some '30's Dillinger-type guy strafes cows with a tommy-gun. Comedy? Symbolism? No; just mindless violence, which detracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story draws upon.Other adaptations of the Odyssey are much better.

"Forget Owen Gleiberman's review, this movie's great!","First, for those of you who don't know who Owen Gleiberman is, he's one of Entertainment Weekly's movie critics. From what I remember reading in his review when ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" came out, he said it was just stupid stereotypes and gave it an F. Now that I've actually seen this movie (I got it for my birthday a few months ago), I realize how stupid I was to trust the opinions of a man who also had the nerve to give ""X- Men"" a C.""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is an excellent film in all senses. I'm normally not a George Clooney fan (Until then, the only movie with him I liked was ""From Dusk Till Dawn""), but his performance in this film was perfect, and he truly deserved that Golden Globe he won for it. I also really liked the actor who played Delmar. His realistically amusing facial expressions and hilarious lines (""We thought...you was...a toad!"")kept me happy all throughout the film. The frightening Sheriff  made an effective villain, and the equally intense scene with the KKK rally was really exciting to behold.The references to the Odyssey were charming and well- done, although I still don't get who George Nelson was supposed to resemble in the ancient Greek story. However, the Siren scene and its aftermath were quite funny, and John Goodman is creditable as the one- eyed Big Dan Teague. Easily one of the best scenes in the movie is when the Soggy Bottom Boys sing ""Man of Constant Sorrow"". That song quickly brought a smile to my face, and should have won that MTV Movie Award for Best Musical Performance.So, you can forget about what the ""professional"" critics at Entertainment Weekly said about it, and just enjoy this hysterical, light- hearted and worthwhile film.",,Anonymous,Crime

An Odyssey Through Mississippi,"George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro star as 3 Mississippi escaped convicts in 30s Mississippi where they run into all kinds of adventure on the way
back to Clooney's home and hearth and aa 'treasure' purportedly buried there.
There's a gubernatorial race going on in Mississippi at the time and that's woven
into the plot.As this film is based on Homer's Odyssey and that work is a few thousand years
old I think the Coen Brothers took the point of view that this is already a few
thousand years in the future and the mythology of the times is being explored
So who will know or care that Pappy O'Daniel did this thing in Texas and Baby
Face Nelson never did his criminal deeds in Mississippi.Speaking of which Charles Durning as Pappy O'Daniel and Michael Badalucco
as Baby Face Nelson are having a ball overacting in their outsized performances. In fact this whole film has everybody overacting like crazy.
Nothing subtle here.The tone however is set by George Clooney as the leader of the three escaped
convicts. His droll style is nothing short of marvelous. Nelson and Turturro
are a pair of brain dead followers who probably did something along the lines
of what Paul Newman did to earn his place on the chain gang in Cool Hand Luke. As for Clooney when we find out what he did his gift of gab is explained.As we know Ulysses was just trying to get home to his Penelope here is Holly
Hunter with her seven daughters. She hasn't exactly let grass grow under her feet, but married to Clooney who could blame her?What Clooney did might be considered white collar crime. But Mississippi had
no minimum security prisons then. Not sure the state has one now. As he sees
it a man like himself is wasted on a road gang and his choice of companions
is dictated by who he was chained with.You will have one rollicking good time watching O Brother Where Art Thou? It's a film that could use several viewings to get all the humor out of it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"O Coen Brothers, Where Were You?...","Praising a Coen brothers' movie because it has style is like praising an ice cream because it's cold, there's got to be more. ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" has all the style a fan of the directing siblings can ask for, but a little more substance wouldn't have hurt the film.Talent is a double-edged sword, the more you prove yourself capable to surprise the viewers, to mesmerize them, to please their eyes and challenge their intellect, the more they expect from your next creation. And after ""Fargo"", perhaps the most universally acclaimed Coen brothers' movie and ""The Big Lebowksy"", a bizarre take on the noir genre whose brilliance sprung lately in our minds, came ""O Brother Where Art Thou"". Watching it, I want to ask the two Coens ""O Brothers, Where Were You?"" A Coen brothers' comedy is an offer you can't refuse, but there are many ways to play comedy, goofy and borderline-parody like in ""Raising Arizona"", surrealistic and over-the-top like in ""The Big Lebowsky"", bleak and engrossing like in ""Barton Fink"" and ""A Serious Man"", or dark and atmospheric like in ""Fargo"", even in the so-called dramatic movies, there was also a few scenes to channel their wicked twisted of humor. But as far as comedy is concerned, the case of ""O'Brother Where Art Thou"" is puzzling, it obviously tries to play on the ""Raising Arizona"" level with the atmosphere of ""Sullivan's Travels"" in the background, but the humor never really manages to hit that special chord so that you can follow the story with the confidence that this is going to be one hell of a belly-laugh ride.And it's even more puzzling because the film actually got the casting right, the first shot with the three fugitives from a chain gang running and ducking in the midst of a cornfield is like borrowed from a 30's cartoon, it successfully sets the tone, something in the line of ""Of Mice and Men"" and Tex Avery. George Clooney is a 'clowny' version of George crossed with a Clark Gable wannabe, his name is Everett, John Turturro is Pete, a sort of Lenny without the good heart, and Tim Blake Nelson is Delmar, a pint-sized Lenny without the strength, and none of Turturro or Nelson even tries to steal Clooney's thunder, which leaves him enough space to display his comical abilities. But there's not much given to him. For instance, there's one part where Pete asks Everett why he's the boss, Everett proposes a vote. Pete proposes himself so it all comes to Delmar, there's no time for him to come with a funny line, their first encounter: a black blind man driving a handcar on a railway.And this is only one of the many colorful tropes of the Great Depression era, a time, full of pastoral melancholy immortalized by so great classics, interestingly many road movies: ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Bound for Glory"", a time made popular through bluegrass music, the sounds of banjo, sepia tones and so many visually appealing details that it's no wonder the Coen brothers decided to venture into this chapter of America and where else than Mississippi could they complete the picture with pies, long railroads, hobos in freighters, a governor who look like the KFC old man and Klan rallies? A Depression film is no depressing premise, not when it is tackled by the Coen brothers and cinematographer Roger Deakings. So what went wrong exactly?Well, the film is said to be adapted from Homer's Odyssey. While it gives the film a certain edge, it doesn't really add much to the story as the Coen brothers reckoned they didn't read the book, so why handicapping a great premise with a needless framework. Are the Coens so uninspired they couldn't make a story of their own? In fact they did, because nothing really evokes the Odyssey apart from the Sirens' encounter, Penny, the wife, played by Holly Hunter is obviously Penelope, with her knitting habit, but what do they add up besides simply 'reminding' of the Odyssey. Take the sirens part, what does that part offer except from the recognition that they are the Sirens? I believe the film would have been more interesting had they stuck to an original screenplay, with so many great characters, they could. But the film was just so busy loosely imitating a never-read book that it created a series of events, enjoyable in their own terms but so inconsistent that even the resolutions feels a bit artificial and unconvincing.At the end, we enjoy it for the stars, the atmosphere (some religious moments are haunting), the performances of John Goodman as Bible salesman and governor Charles Durning as Papy O'Daniel and naturally, the defining song of the film ""A Man of Constant Sorrow"". I would lie if I said the film wasn't enjoyable, every single department is well done but something is lacking in the whole. %aybe if it was made by other directors, we would have been less critical, the fact is the film was made after ""The Big Lebowksy"" and it just didn't compare. Still, as a minor offering, ""Brother' is never as good as when it takes departure from the whole Odyssey's outline and its homage to ""Sullivan's Travels"", a film I didn't even like in the first place. Maybe that's why I'm so critical?Nah it's precisely because I have been so admiring of most of the Coen brothers' works that I allow myself to say this one made me a viewer of constant sorrow.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""O Brother"" is righteous","The Coen Brothers may just be cinema's greatest crackpot auteurs-they deliver sly, ironic stories that generally consist of several weird and wild subplots that all collide in an ending that always leaves a few loose ends for the audience to ponder. Bless them. In the midst of the blockbusters franchises and hipster road movies, seeing a Coen Brothers movie is like inhaling a breath of fresh air. This one is no exception. 'O Brother Where Art Thou' is an adaptation of Homer's sprawling Greek tragedy 'The Odyssey', retold in a new setting-Dustbowl-era Mississippi. George Clooney stars as Ulysses Everett McGill, a slick, suave greaseball of a man who was arrested for practicing law without a license. When he hears that his wife(Holly Hunter)is getting re-married to another man (the hysterical Ray McKinnon), Ulysses busts loose from a chain gang to set things right. However, he must drag along the two men who are chained to him; violent, confused Peter (John Turturro) and ditsy, dim Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson is witty without being one-dimensional). Along the way, the Coen Brothers find time to pack in a run-in with real-life criminal Babyface Nelson, a group of bewitching she-devils, a huge flood, and a KKK rally attended by a hopeful politician and a malicious one-eyed Bible salesman (John Goodman plays him with what could only be described as beastly allure). Through it all, the film (photographed ravishingly by Roger Deakins) is set to a glorious soundtrack of roots music. John Hart, Chris Thomas King and Allison Krauss all deliver excellent tracks, but the real highlight is when Clooney and his co-horts burst into a toe-tapping version of ""Man of Constant Sorrow"", not for the sake of the plot, but for pure enchantment. And that's what 'Brother' is all about-not story (although it has a great one), but serving up a great slice of unadulterated folksy bliss.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Wonderfully odd comedy!,"Coen movies are easy to spot. They have that feel, the feel of originality and oddity, the crazy story lines and characters. Oh Brother has all that. The toned down dustiness of the movie feels less like a gimmick and more like it's supposed to be there, adding to the already thick Southern filter the movie's viewed through.The storyline is imaginative and totally impossible to predict. Giving credit to Homer is a bit silly, since the references to the Oddessy are made for fun and could easily have been discarded without changing the story.Characters are the usual bunch of misfits and crazies you expect. George Clooney does the role of his life-time. Remember the usual, smug, to a varying degree annoying Clooney you see in every movie he's in? Forget him. This is another person. His two companions are good support and fodder for his clever remarks and half-baked plans.Since this is set in the 30's South, there are tons of things to use as comedic elements. KKK, crooked politicians, religion, rednecks... amplify that with Coen's script-writing talent and you will laugh. A lot. There is even one of the trademark hallucination scenes, kind of.What more can you say than: ""Thank you Coens!"" I wont tell you to enjoy this movie. It's very simple. Just watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining,"I can't say I enjoyed this as much as ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""Raising Arizona,"" and felt a little slighted, but ""O Brother"" is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the Coens' brisk, twisted sense of creativity.  The DVD edition contains the featurette, and I was interested to find out that the Coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques.  That surprised me!  Of course, this movie is not the best example (and I'm only saying this in comparison) and it wasn't worthy of any Oscars (many feel it was robbed), but maybe it depends on the appeal.Though I enjoyed the Coens' previous work, I've never been a fan of old westerns or ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" or any of that stuff they show daily on TNN.  I guess that's why I didn't feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie, seeing that it revolves around Southern folk.  For all those from the South who are reading this, I don't mean to offend ANY of your people!  I'm sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like ""A Bronx Tale.""  When you live in the city all your life, it's hard to get accustomed to films of this nature.  But all apologies aside, I found the characters fun and quirky.  I think John Turturro nailed the accent perfectly, and seeing the way he talks in real life I find that amazing.  Tim Blake Nelson was also good.  Of course, George Clooney--who I assume is not the best at feigning accents, judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a New England accent for ""The Perfect Storm""--naturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent.  His performance was good, though. You can also spot Coen regulars like Holly Hunter (in a short but sweet role) and John Goodman (also on screen for a short time, but steals every minute of it).Though I don't normally dig country music, I liked the title song ""A Man of Constant Sorrow.""  The DVD also contains the music video for that song.Overall, I found the film entertaining and original, but it doesn't have that in-your-face quality that the Coens have shown to us in the past.  It's a slighter effort, but a good one.  I still suggest you check it out.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
I really don't get why audiences enjoyed this....,"Oh brother where art thou is a very strange film. I wonder if I'm just not the right kind of person to watch and enjoy this, I know lots of viewers like this movie, but I absolutely hate it. I think George Clooney is a very talented actor and I usually like him both on the big screen and in real life, but he just really annoyed me here. His acting seems way too over the top funny and it's all just too obvious. What I mean by that is that I don't really like it when actors deliver comedic lines so obviously that it's not funny, I prefer more dry/witty type humor. But it's not just the way the actors say the lines, it's also the writing, it's too over the top and obvious. When comedic dialogue is written in that way, in my opinion, they lose their appeal and amusement factor. It drains the funny reaction out that the audience is supposed to experience. And the issue is that it's not like this movie drops lines like that, it's all the time, I could forgive a few moments like that, but not all throughout the whole thing.... So really since the comedy didn't work for me and actors that I normally like were held captive to this bad writing, the whole thing just doesn't work. Also I really hate bluegrass music so whenever that would occur it would just make it that much worse. 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Another gem from the Coens,"Based on homer's Odyssey, we follow Everett Ulysses McGill and his companions Delmar and Pete as they escape from a chain gang so that McGill can get home to his family.  Along the way they must deal with sirens, a bible selling Cyclops, Babyface Nelson, a campaigning Governor, a Klan lynching party and a blind prophet.This is another of the Cohen brothers `different' projects - basically meaning that nothing will make a great deal of sense and won't always follow logical paths but will be full of imagination and energy.  The story won't always be gripping unless you know Ulysses' original adventure.  If you do then the story will be a joy, as you recognise the parallels between the two tales.  Even if you don't there is plenty to enjoy here, the story is so full of funny, imaginative and original characters that you can't help but be drawn in.  From Badalucco's Babyface Nelson (`Oh George, not the livestock'), to Durning's Pappy, everything is handled with such an edge of surrealism that it's captivating.Clooney has never been better and is truly excellent here with his eccentric hick character with a taste for hair cream.  Turturro is also excellent, but Nelson's childlike Delmar is the best character and a great performance. Hunter is as good as she usually is in Coen stuff and the support cast of Durning, Goodman, Badalucco etc are all great.  The music is fantastic, even if you not a fan of this type of music it still fits so totally with the mood of the film that it all works well together.This is a wonderful film - yet another from the Coens.  It has it's slow moments and the episodic nature of the story can sometimes give it an aimless feel, but overall this is significantly better than the sum of it's many great parts.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Good, but maybe just a little too uneven","We can all count on the Coen Brothers giving us an offbeat presentation, and this is no different. There were moments in this film where I felt like a smile was glued to my face.

Perhaps they were sticking to the formula in Homer's ""The Odyssey"" by juxtaposing the pleasant with the horror. But I always felt that Homer's book had more horror than pleasantness to it which made the transition more welcome. Still, it is an interesting film to sit through if only because you will not be able to predict what will follow from one scene to the next. And Clooney is very good here as well.

A Collection of Comedy Sketches,"This the Coen's weakest movie that I've seen. It's not really a movie in the traditional sense, more like a series of sketches strung together rather tenuously.

You could leave during the screening, return in 10 minutes and it really wouldn't matter. Perhaps if I'd seen this before some the Coens' more accomplished recent films I wouldn't have felt so let down. The scenarios that our 3 protagonists find themselves in grow more surreal and ridiculous as the film progresses, and then, bizarrely, for the last half an hour it's extended into a kind of boring melodrama before fading out with a whimper.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

For you see, and I know you'll find this hard to believe, but this here picture show features escaped convicts as its main characters. Now, I know that there are those among your humble and pious ranks whose first reaction is to find this offensive. And to you I say, bless you, kind madams and sirs. Bless you. You are the salt of the Earth and yours is the kingdom of Heaven. And yet to you I also say, open your hearts. For these are the most likable dirty chainbreakers you're ever likely to witness on this good Earth.I might go on to praise the acting of these gentlemen three. Especially that of Mister Clooney, slipping into the guise of Ulysses Everett McGill, a man of words if there ever was one. Why, this man could charm the feathers of a singing bird. He could talk to rain and make it dry. He would don you his hat, flash a smile and become your most trusted friend before dinner.Alas, if we are to talk about this picture show, and talk about it we must, it behooves us to also talk about the mistakes that have slipped in. For you see, and I must ask those weak of heart in the audience to praise themselves, this here picture ain't perfect. I'd dare even say it's flawed.Now, I hear you crying. Mister, what could possibly be wrong with this picture. It's directed by the Brothers Coen. It has Mister George Clooney in it. Its story is based on Homer's The Odyssey. It even has the honour of being the first feature film ever to be fully digitally colour corrected. What possible fault can be found in it?And to you, good sir, I say that the fault lies in its attempt to be a Grecian epic. It's precisely its attempt to imitate art greater than itself which reveals its flaws. Certainly, there are scenes within it that are lifted from the pages of Homer. But they're pale imitations and unwieldy in the setting of Deep South during the decade of 1930. I dare say, they don't fit. They're out of place. They're misaligned, out of whack, purposeless. They are an ill fit.Nevertheless and despite my misgivings about certain aspects of storytelling as they pertain to the general cohesiveness of the cinematic grandiose this picture represents, I did enjoy watching this film. It was a lark, a gay old time. Why, I even find myself recommending it to my friends. Can you imagine?",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Just go see it,"One commenter said that he could tell the people who enjoyed this movie don't get out much.  That's pretty arrogant.  The Shattuck theater in Berkeley was full of people who must not get out much then.True to Coen form, the movie exemplifies what I like about indie films. It's quirky.  It doesn't conform to an ""approved"" plot formula.  It's experimental.  I can pay $8.00 for a movie like that, absolutely HATE the film, and still feel that the chance was worth taking.  Turns out I thoroughly enjoyed O Brother, so that's like getting a bonus.But the next friggin' Mel Gibson historical whitewash, or the next tom hanks 2-hour cliche or the next billy crystal meg ryan syrupy romantic comedy had better be on-the-money or I'll feel I got ripped off.So if you want to go see what everyone else is seeing so you can like what everyone else liked and jabber about the same stupid characters reshot ad nauseam, then you probably want to stay away from anything like this movie. Go rent Sleepless in Seattle for the 100th time and stay in bed.

Oh how it ""rattles one's cage,"" i.e., the KKK, yet beautifully depicts history and tradition that was locked in, and intractable to a certain way of life.The music is haunting, and cleansing at the same time.

By Far the Worst Movie the Coen Brothers Have Ever Done,"Like many people, I first became associated with the Coen brothers through Fargo. They might have been the first filmmakers whose entire body of work I searched out and watched. And I liked every one of them. And then I was the first person in line to see their next film (their previous film now) The Big Lebowski. And that one just added to their shining reputation.And now, some three and a half or so years later, comes their next film, O Brother, Where Art Thou? It has all the marks of a Coen brothers' movie, but, for some reason, it doesn't work at all.And I know why, or at least I think I do. What makes a Coen brothers' film distinct from a film of another director? Some would say quirkiness. This is certainly part of it. But people can copy quirkiness, and have. Take Being John Malkovich. It is possibly the quirkiest film ever made outside of the Coen universe. But no one would mistake it for a Coen brothers' film. Why is this? Well, in my opinion, which, of course, is informed, it is the Coen brothers' sense of perfection and meticulousness both in the technical aspects, the performances, and the script. Technically, O Brother is a match for any of their other films. The cinematography, mise-en-scene, sound and editing are great.The script is the biggest problem. It is bad. Not that there aren't good ideas in there. In fact, any one of the episodes could have turned out to be hilarious. Possibly, its just that there are too many episodes. Therefore, each episode runs for approximately two minutes before it is over. Each episode comprises about one sequence, and each sequence is composed of about two or three scenes. Take a look at Miller's Crossing, for example, to compare. The pace is slow. O Brother is not a short movie, yet it feels that way.And because of the sloppy script, there are no performances to speak of, really. I like any one of the actors on screen, but their characters, even the character of George Clooney, are all one dimensional. It isn't necessary to flesh out every character of a comedy, but I think some of the more colorful supporting characters should have had more screentime, more development. John Goodman should have had a more substantial part, for instance (although his Southern accent is not very good), and Charles Durning's part should have been better. In fact, the whole gubernatorial race part of the plot should have been more in focus. I would have based the plot more around it, rather than having it taking place in the corners. The way the Coens get rid of Durning's opponent is just bad.The only thing the film did get right is the music. The main song that the escapees sing is just marvelous. And all the other songs written by T. Bone Burnett are excellent, also. In fact, it would be a travesty if at least that main song didn't get nominated for an Oscar. It completely deserves it. I would have given the film an all-time Coen brothers low score of 4/10, 7/10 being the former low (The Hudsucker Proxy), but I have to give it at least one point for the music, so final score = 5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Meandering Comedy,"The Coen Brothers ought to be applauded for attempting to make a film out of ""The Oddyssey,"" but it goes about as well well as one would expect of a film made out of an ancient epic poem.

The songs are tuneful, particularly ""The Man of Constant Sorrow.""

Pleasantly suprised,"Headline says it all really. I was a bit sceptical about going to see the film. Firstly the location was an 'Arty' cinema house and that sort of gave me the impression of an 'arty-farty' concept film, not made for the pleasure of the mass public, and a film to establish Clooney as more than a hearthrob. However, I read the review of the film, and according to the review the film would need to be watched more than once to be able to appreciate all the humour, as it came thick and fast. I think that comment was meant for the Dutch, originating from the UK I had no trouble with following the film.To my delight I was delighted with the film. Clooney played his part excellently as did the rest of the cast. The humour was great, at times very stereotypical, at times very subtle.

"The References honoring LOUISIANA, Texas, MISSISSIPPI and the rest of the SOUTH.","The movie seems to contain more references to more things than just about any movie I have ever seen or heard about.The many references to Homer's ""The Odyssey"" are well-known and mentioned in many places on this fabulous site (thank you IMDb).But the references to the south come in a close second to Homer's epic, though they aren't noted as often. I'd like to help change that, and invite others to add their comments.The movie takes place in MISSISSIPPI.The character Charles Durning plays - Pappy O'Daniel - was the actual governor of Texas (1938-1942), was in fact a flour baron, and toured with a band (that's STILL playing together, albeit with new members as well as some of the original ones) called the Lightcrust Doughboys, who specialized in Texas Swing and other old-Tyme music.One song that shows up twice - at critical junctures in the movie - is ""You are my Sunshine,"" the official state song of LOUISIANA, that was penned by a real LOUISIANA governor: Jimmie Davis, who lived to be 101 years old and lived in THREE different centuries ! As Durning's character walks into the radio station in the movie, one of his assistants mentions "" . . . every parish and precinct . . ."" involved in his election campaign for governor.The ONLY state where there are ""parishes and precincts"" is LOUISIANA - all of the other 49 states have ""counties and precincts"" as their political subdivisions.The flooding of the valley recalls the TVA in Tennessee.There must be more references that others know about concerning their state or area.

Brilliant Witty Quasi Musical,"Any semi-intelligent person should be reasonably amused with any production by the Coen Brothers since incredible care is placed into mocking the specific characteristics of common ordinary people. O' Brother Where Art Thou is another success which, like other Coen Brothers films, has a number of messages for the viewer in the course of a film that has several, oddly connected and hilarious scenes.The dialogue is witty and in this film, a good amount of bluegrass music is interspersed with the theatre-like dialogue. Initially it takes a little getting used to in sliding into the concocted dialogue. But what really takes the cake in this film are the incredible performances by all the actors who each have their moment to shine.Clooney is remarkably good as Ulysses, the leader of the pack of convicts who escape a chain gang and wander into the wild, crazy, and mad world of the early 20th century. They come face to face with a number of characters that are included not only for the comedy, but much for the messages that the characters seem to give to the audience through their dialogue. What is wonderful is that the audience, if semi-intelligent, gets to put together the pieces of the moral vignette rather than having it spoon-fed in typical Hollywood style.The running hair joke in this film is hilarious. Even more remarkable is the great performance by comedic Tim Blake Nelson, a relative unknown. Turturro, Goodman, Hunter and Durning are all special as well but we've come to expect excellence from that group. Some may not care for the Coen brothers style but that is most unfortunate since you would be missing out on a collection of the world's greatest non-commercial films ever made in the face of pretentious Hollywood.

Charming and Masterful,"""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a beautiful movie with vivid, endearing characters. The storyline is broken neatly into episodes, apparently much like its source material. I haven't read Homer, so other than a few obvious nods to the classic author (the cyclops, for instance) I missed many of the parallels I'm told are there. It's difficult to pinpoint what makes this such a magnificent movie--probably because there are so many details that add up. The first thing that sold me, like so many others, was the music. The album sales alone stand as a testament to the quality of the soundtrack (I realize album sales don't always equal good music, but here they do). It feels like the movie was made during the Great Depression. If you watch movies made during the time, they were all ""feel good"" flics. Several reviewers here have drawn the savy comparison between OBWAT and ""It Happened One Night"", and specifically between Clooney's and Gable's performances. There are so many things that make this movie worth seeing. My only complaint that sticks is that it could so easily have been made PG. As it stands, it is one of the most harmless PG-13 films in a long time, and I wish the filmmakers hadn't opted to put in the extra ""dammits"" to elevate the movie into the more profitable bracket. Even the famous siren scene seemed tasteful, and sweetly seductive rather than racy. My point? This movie has the potential to make you smile.",,Anonymous,Crime
""" It's  a  Fool  who  Looks  for  Logic  in  the  Human  Heart ""","The Film is called "" O Brother, Where are Thou ? "" is directed by Joel Coen and having been written by his brother Ethan Coen. The story is a Hy-bred cross between a Depression era saga and Homor's ancient epic 'The Odyssey.' Three convicts escape a Chain gang and set off on a journey of discovery during the 1930s'. Though a bit confusing, the Characters more than explain their philosophies and their thoughts on life, each concluding that their suffering and predicaments are part of the natural order of things. Indeed, the stars of the movie more than anything else, give life to the escaping prisoners. George Clooney plays Everett McGill, an educated con-man with family troubles. John Turturro is Pete Hogwallop and Tim Blake Nelson are his two inmate followers who share his trek across the countryside. John Goodman, Michael Badalucco (As Baby-face Nelson) and Charles Durning join the cast and are credited with the spark of Good Ole southern Boys found throughout the story. Escaping from their captivity, the boys search for a buried treasure and are warned by a blind man that what they'll find is not what they hope for. In the meanwhile during the country election they find that their musical talents promise more than they know. What is a complete surprise in this film is the singing talent of George Clooney.

Distinctive and daft,"Whether or not you actually like them, no-one could accuse the Coen brothers' films of not being distinctive. 'O Brother Where Art Thou' is a zany, indeed stupid (although still highly enjoyable) comedy about a hair-gel obsessed prison escapee (played by George Clooney), set in a lovingly created bastardisation of the depression-era American South, underpinned by the music of that time (and the music, surprisingly, is treated with some reverence, however farcical the other elements of the movie). To its credit, it's funny, and quite unlike any other film you'll have seen before. To its detriment, as with a lot of other Coen films, it's not especially emotionally engaging, and there's little in the way of coherent plot, just a ramble through the brothers' strange imagination. As for the claim in the opening credits that it's based on Homer's odyssey, there are some nods in this direction, but don't expect anything too literal; just remember that 'Fargo' was ""based on a true story"" in the same fashion.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Best Coen Brothers Film Yet,"Just seen this film at an NFT preview, and I was blown away by it. It is very funny, gorgeous to look at, has a stunning soundtrack and absolutely impeccable comedy performances. Sharing a similar meandering storyline with the Big Lebowski, it succeed where that film fails by still having a coherent storyline running through and a satisfying resolution. As I've come to expect from the Coens, the visuals are striking but they've never been this beautiful before, and at no time - unlike - in previous films, do they seem merely to be there as an exercise in cleverness. But what makes this film is the excellent comic performances from even the smaller roles (several of whom are Coen regulars) - Even though the characters, as in many coen films, are (slightly irregular) stereotypes the performances give even the shallow characters a depth and makes the scenes even more funny.

It's just that I personally enjoy many of the other Cohen films more than this one, many of which are some of my favourite movies in general, 'The Big Lebowski' to be specific.I can appreciate the clever writing that parallels Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, and places the story right in the middle of hillbilly haven.It's a film I would have no problem recommending, but I would just add that it's not my favourite... for reasons I can't quite explain.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Faulknerian Odessey,"O Brother is, simply put, a spectacular tour-de-farce that has all the elements required for a great movie in the style of old Depression era Hollywood. Before seeing this for the second time, we rented Sullivan's Travels by Preston Sturges. It was really cool to see the references the Coens did to Sullivan's Travels in O Brother!Now, a few comments about O Brother: The visuals were stunning. From the antique cars to the grimy clothes to the brilliant yellow fields, this movie gets an A+ for visual depth and brilliance.  Likewise, the soundtrack is great. I'm personally a fan of hillbilly music, but even my husband and friends who aren't could get into the great music. Also, the dialogue was hilarious! There are some great, ludicrous gems in this movie. Also, the characters were truly brilliant, Faulknerian in their tragic comedy. After seeing this movie, I wish the Coens would do a film adaptation of As I Lay Dying, IMO one of the greatest epic comic/tragedies Faulkner ever wrote!The characters brought this movie to life. Ulysses Everett McGill, the fast-talking, inventive ""Paterfamilias"", played by George Clooney was both likeable and ridiculous with his schemes.  John Tutturo's flashing eyes and fierce expression, coupled with his gravelly voice and molasses-thick dialect, stamped the role of Pete on my heart. And Tim Blake Nelson played the innocent, empty-headed, big hearted Delmar with charm reminiscent of Evell Snopes in Raising Arizona.  It was no wonder butterflies flocked to the childlike, charming Delmar- if an ex-con may be called charming.The secondary characters were also terrific. McGill's estranged wife, Penny played by Holly Hunter, the seven little Wharvey gals, the acerbic Pappy O'Daniels played to the hilt  by Charles Durning, the malefic Big Dan Teague, Bible salesman-cum-mugger, hilariously played by John Goodman, George (""NOT Baby-Face"") Nelson, Tommy Johnson and the Devil, just to name a few.By the way, does anybody else think that the prison warden was the Devil? Think about how Tommy Johnson described the Devil at the crossroads, then look at the warden...All in all, to those to complain that this movie is ""pointless"" or just a ""bunch of stuff strung together"", I humbly suggest that that is what an odessey IS. It is a journey in which the journey itself is more important than the outcome. O Brother is an epic farce which brings together a rich stew of elements of Depression era history, politics and nostalgia, mixes it with some truly outlandish humor and mythic storytelling, and brings it all together to create one of the most heart warming, feelgood movies I have ever seen.I give this movie a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

I usually enjoy movies set in the depression era and I sat down in eager anticipation to watch this one. The 30s backdrop and the atmosphere conjured up by the bluegrass soundtrack were perhaps the film's only saving graces. But the plot (such as it was) and the characters were just awful.

The cinematography is beautiful, and following around these three escaped convicts is interesting to watch.

They go on several long adventures, sing a few songs, and more than anything, try to avoid the police. All 3 of the leading actors are very good, and have an odd (but great) chemistry with each other. Tim Blake Nelson, especially, stands out acting wise as the confused convict who wants to be erased of all his sins. The movie has no real plot or center, which is fine, but some of the sub-plots are dull, and bring this movie down a level from where it could be.

A worthy and successful effort.,"Any film director who decides to try to use material of Homer, Ovid or another classic immediately deserves congratulations for the courage. Even if his effort wasn't positive he tried. I say that because I read Homer and I know how heavy this author can be. Its a kind of literature extremely difficult to adapt. The Coen Brother's went a step further: they took Homer to the cinema in a way that hardly resembles Homer. They put old Greek story into a new context, giving it a different shape. All done with the usual touch of sarcastic elegance that is the signature of these directors.The plot's main idea is simple but takes time to show itself: Everett Ulysses McGill is a convict who decides to flee his labor camp and try to prevent his fiancé from marrying another man. He takes two other prisoners who were fortunately chained together with him. Some moments of the film are very funny and the irony is always there. Sometimes we wonder where are the logic but the film quickly explains most of the illogical moments (except, perhaps, the hundreds of pomade cans that appear throughout the film, which I honestly don't quite understand). In contrary to some critics, I don't think reading ""Odyssey"" is important to understand this movie, although it helps us to notice some nebulous scenes. The work of the actors is well done but no actor overlaps George Clooney, almost unrecognizable, with an intense southern accent. Well, maybe Tim Blake Nelson is as good as Clooney, thanks to the naive way he played Delmar. Finally, a word of appreciation for the costumes and scenarios, absolutely faithful to the period in which everything happens, as well as the enveloping and animated soundtrack, that gives life to the story.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"O Brother, tell me when to laugh!","The gangs of rock-cracking prisoners in the opening scene, all singing a dirge in harmony was a great way to start and promised some startling entertainment to follow.   But no! This contrived comedy with music just went down-hill after that.  Oh dear! just tell me when to laugh. The Ku Klux Klan scene was quite striking though it did not go anywhere, the ""sirens"" in their wet clinging garments were nicely seductive, the idea of carrying around a friend (turned into a toad) in a little box was intriguing and a furious escape from a barn all ablaze was exciting enough, but.... May be it was the melodramatic delivery of the lines and the strain of trying to understand the assumed southern accents that got at me.  No sir, this was a wasted evening for me and one of the worst films of the year. My advice, brother, is...forget it!",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"boring, unfunny","I was really ready to enjoy this movie. After reading some very positive reviews for it and hearing it was weird and funny I decided to rent it. It had competition from the likes of Space Cowboys, Meet the Parents, Crouching Tiger, and Nurse Betty (all of which I could've rented) but I felt confident somehow this movie was going to be worth my money. But it was quite a mistake I made. Although this movie looked beautiful, it was boring and often made no sense. I didn't laugh once. It was definitely weird and unusual, but not worth the money to see. It was completely pointless. Maybe I just didn't ""get"" it.

Mrs. Hogwallop up and R-U-N-N-O-F-T.,"Fargo. No. O Brother Where Art thou. Yes. O Brother Where art thou is the Coen Brothers best picture. This movie is filled with great comedy and great music. The movie is based on Homer's The Odyssey. I'd personally would rather watch this adaptation of the book than read the book itself. The movie stars as George Clooney stars as Ulysses Everett McGill, John Tuturro stars as Pete and Tim Blake Nelson as dim witted Delmar O'Donnell. All of them play escaped convicts looking for the treasure that Everett had buried before going to jail. So when they bust out out of jail it is a whole new adventure waiting for them. When they record a song to get some cash they end up recording a hit song. Everyone is looking for these new found musicians but they are trying to hide from the law. This whole movie is filled with hilarious one liners from Clooney. The move also stars Holly Hunter, Charles Durning and John Goodman as a greedy bible salesman. This movie is a success in in every aspect and it is the Coen brothers greatest film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Did you like Homer's the Odyssey?,I thought this movie was great! I saw this when it came out in the theaters so I do not remember all the details. I remember it being based on Homer's tale on Odysseus. Names places and events are changed but you can still see the resemblance to the tale.I found it funny how they would get themselves into trouble and how they would get themselves out of it. I really enjoyed this version of modernized old tales much better than the Romeo and Juliet with Clair Danes.I will agree that in some parts of the tale it does get a little to silly at times but all in all it is a great adventure with some big name actors.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best movie I have ever seen,"It is simply the best movie I have ever seen. The entire cast is superb. Excellent acting: not only George Clooney is fabulous as Everett, but so are the supporting actors (Tim Blake Nelson, John Turturro, John Goodman, Michael Badalucco, Holly Hunter, Wayne Duvall, Ray McKinnon etc.). The cinematography is brilliantly composed, magnificent pictures by Roger Deakins. The soundtrack is excellently chosen, no wonder it became a tremendous success. The story of Odyssey by Homer is paraphrased with care, it captivates you from the beginning to the end.

Non-stop side-splitting laughs.,"If laughter's good for the soul, I've had a spiritual cleansing just watching this movie.  Then again, if laughter's also the best medicine, then my health must be perfect after watching this Coen brothers masterpiece of dark humor.  How can such a depressing location with such a downcast group of individuals be funny?  Just have the Coen brothers touch it with their unique brand of humor!  My [grown] son, my brothers and I all loved Raising Arizona.  We laughed till our sides ached, and it was without doubt the most hysterically funny movie we had all seen... until O Brother Where Art Thou? was made.  Now we have TWO fabulous comedies from which to choose whenever we are down in the dumps and need a GUARANTEED LAUGH! A BIG PLUS in this movie was the excellent music.  The sound track alone lifts the spirits -- even with the Soggy Bottom Boys' big hit having such a ""downer"" title:  Man of Constant Sorrow. Out of a rating of 1 through 10 I'd give this [and Raising Arizona] an 11.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Quirky comedy from the Coens,"While not as well-known as some of their other films, 'O Brother' is another great film by the Coens - a unique comedy/adventure with an enjoyable storyline and some genuinely hilarious individual scenes.

It's clear that this film wants the audience to have fun, and it definitely succeeds.'O Brother' is put together really well. It looks great and is beautifully shot, making the most of the rural setting and stunning scenery.

"O Cohesion, Where Art Thou?","I haven't seen many of the Coen Brothers' films, although one of the two I have seen is one of my favorites (""Fargo""), and the other I've seen is one I don't care for very much (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""). One of the films has a lot of humor, the other doesn't. One of the films is extremely entertaining; the other is just sort of boring.""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a retelling of Homer's ""Odyssey,"" or ""Homer's Odyssey,"" since you never see the title without the name preceding it anymore; Homer's name is practically part of the title, now. Am I digressing?It starts with three runaway convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmer (Tim Blake Nelson). Everett - as his chumps call him - has a strange fascination with his own hair, and Dapper Dan hair cream. ""I'm a Dapper Dan Man!"" he proclaims after being offered another brand of hair cream by a store clerk (who unfortunately doesn't carry Dapper Dan but looks as if he couldn't give a hoot either way). And, in another one of the film's few funny scenes, we see local police picking up a trail on the threesome after a bloodhound finds a tin can of Dapper Dan and a hairnet lying by a diminished fire.The trio has escaped from jail in hopes of finding an ancient treasure not delved into by the film so very much. Along the way they meet an odd assortment of characters, including a black guitarist who sold his soul to Satan so that he could learn to play guitar; a baby-faced criminal trying to make a name for himself; and a bulky thief (John Goodman) who steels what little fortunes the men have achieved by singing on the radio under the combined name of The Soggy Bottom Boys.Along the way they also encounter Everett's wife (Holly Hunter), who claims he was hit by a train, tells her seven children this, and refuses to acknowledge him as her husband. With the law in hot pursuit of them, the boys have only their brains to fall back on - and they don't have much of that available for use.The plot's not the problem with the film (per se). It has fun with itself; the bluegrass music is perfect for the film and makes you feel like you're in Mississippi. The problem is the way the film has a million different ideas going on that it never seems able to make sense of. The film takes spiritual detours that pay off at the end, but nothing is ever truly resolved. In one scene towards the overdue finale, Everett gets down on his knees and prays to God to deliver them from their doom. Suddenly a gigantic tidal wave roars through and demolishes their surroundings, leaving them alive and bobbing on the water's surface.I've read ""The Odyssey,"" but even with all its weirdness in mind I don't remember it being this weird. It's been a while, yes, but I don't remember a giant tidal wave and I certainly don't think it belongs in a feature film with enough wasted ideas. At least `The Odyssey' was weird for a reason  `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' could certainly do without the strangeness.Every time George Clooney is on-screen you'll be having some minimal amount of fun at least, but when he's gone and the film takes its time rooting through some unimportant sub-plots, it gets to be a real bore. It's not even two hours long but it feels like it's three.The plus side? Depression-era Mississippi comes alive, and in some scenes the dry filming makes you thirsty for a glass of cold water. Not only that, but just as in ""Fargo,"" the Coen Brothers are able to make us feel a sort of attachment to the characters - but even with Everett's funny infatuation with hair gel, he's not in the same league as Marge Gunderson, and he never will be.The first time I saw this movie in 2000 (the year of its release), I absolutely hated it. Back then, perhaps I was expecting something too close to ""Fargo."" Maybe I just wanted something better. So with last night's repeat viewing, I made sure I wasn't expecting anything. I made sure I put away all pretensions. It still didn't impress me.""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" does have some good parts, but for being a comedy it certainly doesn't have very many laughs, and for being a lightweight, uplifting drama it seems too caught up in darker ideas that don't need meddling with. And, apart from everything else, it's just plain weird. It's a whole lot different than ""Fargo,"" which might sound good since change is often welcomed from director(s). But whereas M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" was different than ""The Sixth Sense"" in a delightfully splendid way, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is sort of like George Lucas' latest installments into the extended ""Star Wars"" series. They may be different, but they're definitely not any better.2.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

From the ""crossroads"" tales of Robert Johnson, the Bible belt gospel of Alison Krauss, and the other songs which still today defy categorization, such as ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" and ""Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby"", by an array of artists who themselves easily fall outside the pigeonholes.

"O Brother, where were thou?","After two years of World War II movies and Roman spectacles, I found myself at the local video store's new release' section recalling Yogi Berra's quip :'It's déjà vu, all over again'.Fortunately, Joel and Ethan Coen, weren't  suffering (entirely) from déjà vu when the musical epic `Oh Brother, where art thou?' sprang from their heads.At first glance, I thought I was watching an intellectualized `Three Stoogers' slapstick. At least until the three heroes meet John Goodman, and in an instant, I found myself wishing I was paying more attention to this so-far-out parody of Homer's eternally classic epic, the Odyssey. And long before the end of this classic-to-be had ended, I was already planning to watch it again and scrambling and digging for my English translation of ancient Greek literature.The cast and performances and humor have depth, and the music will hook your ears as if it came from sirens of bluegrass.By folding in eternally beautiful bluegrass, slightly tempering the entire mix with the premise of the epic ancient Greek poem, whipping the entire mix with the absolutely great performances by George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Nelson, the Coen brothers have served up an epic of cinematic Homeric proportions, that actually may be enjoyed more than once.If you are becoming tired of seeing one time wonders, see this for the first, second or third time, or just get it again for the music.",,Anonymous,Crime

"O Muse, what have they done?","I read on the trivia page that the Coen brothers hadn't read TheOdyssey before working on O Brother Where Are Thou, and I reallybelieve that.  If they had, this could have been a really smart movie.As it is, it vaguely refers to parts of The Odyssey, without muchthought being put.  The few scenes that are inspired by TheOdyssey are clustered together and late in appearing. I got theSirens' part, but why mix that with Circe?  Why does the KKKmeeting represent Hades (Hades in not hell and is not limited to'bad' people)?  What the heck is Cyclops doing there anyway?These elements are too randomly included for the movie to ""bebased"" on The Odyssey.One huge difference between O Brother and The Odyssey is thecharacter of Odysseus -he wasn't a thief, he was a king!  Hetraveled 10 years to reach his home and lost all his men on theway.  His outer beauty reflected his nobility and wit.  In a word, hewas perfect.  Although Clooney's character is a smartass, he's notexactly smart.  Penelope is of course the other great character inThe Odyssey, where she patiently waits for Odysseus's return,who , upon his return, kills all the suitors who abused thehospitality they were offered.  O Brother also forgets Telemachus,their son. If this movie intended to transpose scenes from The Odyssey ontothe rural American South, it could have done so in many differentways, but I guess reading Homer should have been the first step.Magic could have been out of it then.I failed to find this movie 'hilarious' but I did find the photographybeautiful, as well as the incorporation of music.  I am not veryfamiliar with the Coen's films -I only saw Fargo and that was 2weeks ago- but they seems stuck on idiocy, and I have a hard timeappreciating that.  Another thing they seem to do is open with ageneral appeal. In O Brother the opening lines of The Odysseyappear, and in Fargo we are told that the following story is true(which isn't because there's a disclaimer with the end credits).  I'mnot sure what the point of these openings is since they're bothdeceptive.

"O Creativity Where Art Thou? Oh, I see, you're here.","Ah Coen Brothers - you can expect a step up from the humdrum with these two and this movie is no exception. It's about three escaped convicts off to get some hidden treasure in the Deep South of the 40s, and based loosely around the Greek epic `The Odyssey' with George Clooney playing Ulysses Everett McGill. They have a series of adventures of course, including creating a hit musical single (that they're unaware of) and meeting a variety of colourful characters like John Goodman in the delightful role of Big Dan Teague.Is this movie hilarious? Not to me, no. It's more in the Wes Anderson vein of being bizarrely `quirky'. Some of the jokes are quite dumb, and others come from the characters themselves - both in their actions and the reactions of others. Ulysses' constant chatter is a very amusing counterpoint to his companions' near inability to speak word. Indeed the characters here are, unlike many comedies, fairly well built and become quite likable, rising above the general shallowness of the genre. The actual plot starts off with them going through a series of seemingly unconnected adventures, but concludes, somewhat obviously, with them all coming to a head. Nevertheless you can't help but recognise the strangeness, and humour, in the coordinated dancing of a Ku Klux Klan crowd (it's just very, very, bizarre).Acting is all solid here and Clooney once again proves he's not just a pretty face (although he's proved himself to me already by now). His side kicks - John Turturro and Tim Blake - are all fine too, playing congenital idiots, and they're all backed up by a fine supporting cast, including Goodman in one of his finest ever roles.The cinematography is, as I would expect from the Coen brothers, excellent. There's a lovely feeling of the Deep South of the times, captured in long shots throughout the movie and an excellent attention to set and costume design. The music, the most famous component of the movie, suits the flavour of the movie though the genre, not being in anyway my favourite, grated on occasion (although the main song of the movie almost made up for it in a toe-tapping way). But once again the Coen brothers have pulled off a polished little package (I've never seen a bad movie by them), that's humorous (without being hilarious), quirky (without being down right weird), well acted (without being outstanding) and generally entertaining (without being a `Best Movie Ever' type).

His perfect Hollywood face, dirty as it was, still seemed out-of-place among the 'real people' cast. He delivered a much better performance than I was expecting of him, though.

"O Barf Bag, Where Art Thou?","Oof! This terrible movie, which I regret having wasted any time on, is built around racist stereotyping of the lowest sort, except the characters are white Southerners, so I guess that makes it okay.  According to ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", everyone in 1930's Mississippi was either a dancing Klansmen, a  dumb cracker, or a generic black victim (who gets virtually no lines in the film).I think the low point (and there were many in this horrible movie) had to be putting Ralph Stanley's sublime masterpiece ""O Death"" into the mouth of the Klan Grand Dragon as the prelude to a lynching. For old-time music lovers, this is roughly the equivalent of what a Catholic would feel watching a porn actor belt out ""Ave Maria"" right before a big sex scene.George Clooney proves once again that he can't act, John Turturro reminds everyone how well he can, Charles Durning gets a few laughs, and Gillian Welch, Emmylou Harris, and the rest of the singers get a paycheck at the expense of their immortal artistic souls.How could the Coen Brothers, makers of some of the best movies of the last 20 years, be responsible for this travesty?",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Coen Brothers Triumph Again!,"'O Brother, Where Art Thou' is a gleeful retelling of Homer's 'Odyssey', set in 1930s Mississippi and rampant with splendid quirkiness that is the trademark of the brothers Coen. Three hapless convicts make their escape to find treasure--and more than their share of adventure--in this delightful film. George Clooney is in fine, ingenuous form as the chatty, amiable leader of the trio; but the real acting kudos go to John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as his goofy but lovable cohorts, dubbed the 'Soggy Bottom Boys' by Clooney's character after they receive baptism by full immersion in a river. The three cut a record under that homespun nom-de-plume for the cash, and unwittingly become overnight sensations with veritable 'rock star' status. The film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical. And there are some incredible feats of film-making here: the scene at the KKK rally is a real doozy, and is so similar to the scene when Dorothy's friends rescue her from the witch's castle in 'The Wizard of Oz' that it almost amounts to cinematic plagiarism. And what an amazing work of plagiarism it is! Without giving away the ending, I must say the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking sequences put to film in recent memory (on a par with the spectacular finale of 'Magnolia', another one of my favorites).

The Odyssey with music and laughs,"The Coen brothers present a reasonably entertaining comedy very loosely based on Homer's Odyssey. The hero of this film's journey is Everett, whose first name is actually Ulysses, and whose story parallels that of Homer's hero. But Everett's story is very much unique, the Coens take a rough outline from Homer and then make the story all their own. The story unfolds in rural Mississippi in 1937, a unique and, as we will come to see, rather strange place. Everett is an escaped convict who has two companions on his journey. Pete and Delmar were chained to Everett at the time of his escape, he convinced them to go along with him by filling their heads with a story of buried treasure. They lose the chains, will they find the treasure? The first person they stumble upon after their escape tells them they will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. Interesting. What will fate have in store for our trio at the end of their arduous journey?This is a comedy film which has its funny moments but the film is rather uneven. The laughs don't come as consistently as you would like. It is music more than comedy which really sparks the film to life. Everett, Pete and Delmar end up unwitting radio stars, the Soggy Bottom Boys. Their hit song, Man of Constant Sorrow, is a treat. The film has a good, lively mix of folk and bluegrass music throughout. So, the music is fun. The story doesn't quite match the music though. There are times where things move a little too slowly, times where things get a little too weird. At one point Delmar is convinced Pete has been turned into a toad. Yes, weird indeed. Delmar is a bit of a dim bulb, Pete isn't much brighter. Everett is the brains of the operation but, while he's got a quick wit, he's surely no genius either. There are times when the dimness of the trio is endearing, but there are times where it wears thin too.Everett, Pete and Delmar are certainly the focus of the story but they meet plenty of interesting characters on their Homer-inspired journey. And, keeping with the offbeat theme of the entire film, many of these characters are exceedingly odd. This really is a strange film but the Coens pull it all together reasonably well. George Clooney, playing Everett, is a good star to build around. Clooney brings real personality to the role. John Turturro, as Pete, and Tim Blake Nelson, as Delmar, complement Clooney well. There may be times the story drags, times where the comedy misses the mark. But it is not the fault of the performers, everyone suits their role very well. John Goodman and Holly Hunter are among those who pop into the film, portraying characters who take the story in some surprising directions. It seems a simple story, that of Everett and friends on an ordinary journey. But there is nothing ordinary about the world of this film. The Coens have populated this world with some supremely strange people. And that makes for a decent bit of fun. Maybe the film doesn't always work as well as it should but it perks up enough here and there to keep you interested and entertained. Things get a little bizarre at times but there is some fun in that too. And the music keeps things lively, you'll be clamoring for more of the Soggy Bottom Boys. This is certainly not the greatest comedy the Coens ever produced. But it's good enough to satisfy.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
One Of The Best Comedies Ever Made,"Arguably the best Coen brothers film ever (and that's saying a lot), this work of genius would be in my Top 10 great movie comedies of all time, if I had such a list. The script is brilliant, as is the story. Then add the off-the-charts performances of so many top-notch actors starting of course with George Clooney (who puts in a bravura performance that brings to mind the brilliance of a Cary Grant), John Turturro (who was never better and never more endearing, stealing many scenes in fact as the backwoods Pete Hogwallop), and Tim Blake Nelson as the lovable but terminally dumb Delmar O'Donnell...but then there are the exceptional performances of so many great character actors it's almost impossible to give everyone credit. Charles Durning puts in perhaps his funniest comic performance ever (you have GOT to see him dancing!) as Gov. Pappy O'Daniel. John Goodman...what a performance he delivers, as Big Dan Teague! You have to see this film just to see the incredible job Goodman does here (one of his best roles ever)! Even vignette-player and fine character actor Stephen Root impresses as a blind radio station guy - what an imagination! He creates one of the most memorable comic characters you'll ever see in a movie. He leaves an indelible impression, one of the highest points of a film with many high points. He will have you in stitches. I'm not a fan of Holly Hunter usually, but here even she puts in a brilliant performance as Clooney's quirky and quixotic wife. Ray McKinnon as Vernon T. Waldrip and Frank Collison as Wash Hogwallop - both bit parts - shine brightly as well. The music's incredible too - I had to buy both the DVD of the movie and the CD of the score, the music was so endearing. This movie sizzles on every level and the cast and crew all were on the top energy level in synch and with a chemistry rarely seen in film. Can't top this.

A masterpiece,"Being a true cineatic since my early childhood I have discovered that most films generally either move you AND end up tragically or make you laugh though not move you very much.

Maybe even the crown-jewel of my shrine.Just taste the essential idea of it: A travesty of Homer's Ulysses located in the hot south of the United States, that takes place at the beginning of the 20th century - surely this must stimulate your curiosity, mustn't it? Three prisoners escape their captivity, together (they have to, as they happen to be linked together by their balls and chains) aiming to find the golden loot from a robbery .

"Confusing, but pretty to look at.","Touted as a version of Homer's Odyssey, this could-have-been-great film is beautifully photographed, but makes no sense.  Forced inclusions of Homer's famous characters (The Sirens and Polyphemus being the most broadly recognizable) don't help prevent this oddment from ultimately failing to meet its own goal of being about... well, what?  It's the comic evolution of three men escaping from a Depression-era chain gang.  Clooney, playing the overeducated leader, has some witty lines, drawing their laughs from the misfit way he rambles polysyllabically (sp?) at simple folk who neither know, nor really care much, what he is talking about.  Finally, neither will you, as it turns out he has no real mission.  The character himself turns out to be confused, despite his vocabulary, even to the point of flatly ignoring the severe beating a friend receives while sitting next to him. The ""Odyssey"" metaphor ultimately fails, too, as he is not quite rewarded with his archetype's deserts, gaining nothing of any great consequence in the end.

"Should Be Called ""Oh BrotherS, Where Art Thou?""","`Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?'  is ostensibly based on Homer's `The Odyssey,' but I have no reason to doubt the Coen Brothers when they say that they've never actually read it.  The film really has nothing to do with that epic poem other than the fact that the filmmakers throw plot elements from the original haphazardly into the mix every now and then.  Need a Cyclops? Dress John Goodman up in an eye patch to no point or purpose.  Sirens?  Have the main characters stumble across three beautiful women singing and washing clothes by a riverside, even though the scene seems totally contrived and arbitrary in the context of the story.  The Coen Brothers' lack of familiarity with the original is only too apparent.Actually, this is one of their worst films, no doubt about it  slow, arch, disjointed and heavy-handed in both its plotting and its humor.  The original `Odyssey' was an epic tale filled with adventure, high drama and great themes involving issues of courage, pride, commitment and love.  `Oh Brother' is none of these.  It is, in fact, silly, cramped and trivial.  The role of Ulysses has been assigned to George Clooney, as the leader of a trio of convicts who escape from a chain gang in the Depression Era Midwest.  As they roam the countryside, they encounter a myriad of bizarre, eccentric characters, some derived loosely from `The Odyssey' and some not.  None of it really works, partly due to the arbitrariness of the plotting and partly due to the fact that the humor is not very well executed.  In fact, most of the wit consists of having the actors overplay their facial expressions and accents.  As a result of these two factors, the strain never ceases to show.So are there any good things to be found in `Oh Brother'?  Well, the movie does look good, thanks to fine cinematography and art direction, which beautifully capture the look of the dusty rural countryside of the 1930's. And there is, of course, the occasional joke or idea that actually does work despite the fact that the film as a whole is a major disappointment. Perhaps, in the case of this particular Coen Brothers film, the title is inadvertently symbolic.",,Anonymous,Crime

Hilarious and clever.,"I saw this film years ago, and afterwards I named it as my favorite film on several occasions. Then I forgot why. Now I saw it again and remember.The plot is simple enough: Everett (wonderfully portrayed by Clooney), a handsome, vain man whose lines undoubtedly contain over 70% of the film's vocabulary, gets the two prisoners chained to him, Pete and Delmar, to join him in seeking a treasure he buried after an armored car robbery before a river is dammed and the valley in which he buried it flooded with water. Meanwhile they are chased by a cold-blooded Sheriff Cooley (at one point in the film subtly likened to Satan) and have to overcome various obstacles ranging from Pete supposedly being turned into a toad to being seduced by three blatant references to the sirens of the Odyssey. This all becomes amusingly tangled into the electoral campaigns of the two men running for governor, 'Pappy' O'Daniel the hotheaded old man who is striving for re-election and Homer Stokes, who is secretly a Ku Klux Klan leader.There are few films that stand out to me as being 'perfect', ones where there is nothing I can nitpick on, but this is one of them. It is neither too long nor too short, the humour is golden, the characters are endearing, every scene would detract from the film if it weren't there, and the ending is very satisfying but not sappy.

Clooney & Turturro head an entertaining cast,"Entertaining if somewhat ultimately silly picaresque tale set in the rural South of the 1930's.

The photography is wonderful, the characterizations generally very good. Along the way they become unexpected recording stars when their spontaneous performance at a rural radio station strikes a chord with listeners. For those who might doubt John Turturro's credibility as a rural hick, check out his performance here. Holly Hunter has a minor role as Clooney's wife who has told their kids he was dead. Charles Durning is a hoot as the Governor of Mississippi. One scene that struck me as somewhat strange was the Ku Klux Klan scenario toward the end of the film.

"Bizarre, yet highly entertaining","Whether you like the Coen brothers or not, there can be no debating that they make extremely interesting movies that aren't by the book. There's no question that ""O Brother"" doesn't deviate from that formula. The film has many scenes that don't make a whole lot of sense to me, but I suppose if you've read the Odyssey (I have) and actually remember it (I don't) then you might comprehend it completely. The cast is solid, especially Clooney and Turturro. However, don't listen to Clooney when he tries to tell you he did his own singing, because he didn't. And it's obvious, because if that was him singing, he'd have had a few albums released. The film's strongest asset is its soundtrack, and I challenge anyone who views it to just try and not have ""I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow"" stuck in your head for days afterwards.

George Clooney over-acting,"I was disappointed when i watched this movie because i had heard so much about it. I found a couple of bits slightly funny but it seemed to drag a bit just after halfway through so that i fell asleep while watching it. For the first half hour George Clooney over-acted so that his character was just irritating. The dim-witted redneck boys were a racial stereotype, as were many of the characters - why was that acceptable while racially stereotyping an African-Caribbean man was self-consciously not? I think more could have been made of Don Goodman's character, which was larger than life and comical. I was intrigued at how the directors handled the race issue (since it was set in a historical context) & i think they just about passed but tackling it was just asking for trouble.

I have known people like the three convicts central to this story.. this makes the story somewhat plausible.

Fantastic,"I actually didn't watch this movie for several years after it first came out, because I wasn't a George Clooney fan and it just didn't ""sound interesting"" to me--which is another lesson why not to judge by the title. This movie had incredible humor, fantastic acting, a great plot with excellent foreshadowing (you'll have to watch the movie twice to appreciate this) and is a fun wild ride. Anyone who has read Homer's The Odyssey will also find extra humor, like turning the Cyclops into a one eyed Bible salesman. Fantastic.

the dog's wotsits,"Speaking as an Englishman, I cannot comment on the film's authenticity, but as an evocation of my impression of the ""Deep South"" of the Twenties, only two movies compare. Cool Hand Luke, and the title I can't remember with Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier. What it does have (that they don't) is a sense of humour. It has no equal, it is one of the best films I have seen in years. George Clooney shows a talent I have never seen before, as do his two co-stars. Charles Durning has always been wonderful, but if I have a criticism of the film, he is a bit OTT. See it, and think about it.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Oh yes, this oozes charm...","Perhaps a little too much, in fact.  It's fun, it's sweet, it's sometimes inspired, the bleached, golden landscapes owe a lot to a nostalgia that for a non-American audience is instantly recognizable and therefore (I assume) pays a debt to fiction than historical reality, the music is great (clocking both Alan Lomax recordings from the period & intelligent country greats like Gillian Welch, Alison Krauss & Emmy-Lou Harris in the sirens' song) and the performances are fine: Holly Hunter is never less than a delight.  But 'O Brother, Where Art Thou' displays very little of the sardonic humour of 'Fargo' or 'Raising Arizona', or the technical perfection of the comedy in 'The Big Lebowski' (surely one of the absolute best comedies of the last decade).

Listen to the Soundtrack and Skip the Movie,"""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" features some of the best and worst tendencies of the Coen Brothers as they reexamine another movie genre.The cinematography is lush -- where ""Fargo"" was visually about white, ""Miller's Crossing"" visually about dark and ""Barton Fink"" fascinated by the look of fire, ""O Brother"" lingers over golden and amber waves of grain. ""In Fargo,"" I thought the Coens had genuine love for their home turf underneath the satire and cruelty, but here we have a South of yokel myth, that makes Preston Sturges' magical ""Sullivan's Travels"" --which this is close to a remake of--seem like a documentary. The Daughters of the Confederacy who walked out of ""Gone With The Wind"" for showing that the South lost the War Between the States would surely walk out of this one.Like a humorous counterpoint to ""Dancer in the Dark,"" this feels like a European musical's look at the South of the Great Depression, from corrupt politicians, to chain gangs, to river baptisms, to KKK rallies, road kill BBQs, and bank robberies.But it comes alive through the overpowering music selected by T-Bone Burnett that becomes the central focus of the movie (complete with a pilgrimage to a radio station as in ""American Graffiti"" but with a commercial and political exploitation angle: ""Hey a man there will pay you for singing into a can!""). Few other than public radio listeners will feel disconcerted having the very distinctive voices of Allison Krauss, Emmy Lou Harris, Gillian Welch, the Fairfield 4, and Ralph Stanley come out of actors' mouths, like in ""Pennies from Heaven,"" because the music is the basis for mesmerizing, highly theatrical set-pieces.It must have been at the directors' direction that John Torturro gives the worst performance of his otherwise exemplary career and Tim Blake Nelsonis worse, as their faces are frozen in Ma and Pa Kettle stereotypes. George Clooney tries a Southern accent for 30 seconds then gives up, which is ironic as he was born and raised in Kentucky. His container of Dapper Dan hair pomade becomes an ongoing leitmotif like the hat in ""Miller's Crossing"" with no significance other than the visual.I did miss the opening minute or so due to strong hunger pains and a slow refreshment line, but I don't think seeing the opening quote from Homer would have changed my impression. I recommend the soundtrack rather than the video.(originally written 12/30/2000)",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

That means, singing live bluegrass, hitchiking, jumping on and off trains, and meeting women with strange powers, encountering the Ku Klux Klan, plus more.This film is one of the funniest, most hilarious comedies I have seen in a very long time.

The Odyssey  according to the Coen brothers,"The Coen brothers are probably America's most creative minds in recent years as shown by the many projects they have brought for our benefit in order to entertain us. As with all creative persons, some films are extraordinary, some are excellent, and a few miss the mark. Having seen the film in its original release, we were fortunate to see again in DVD format recently. With ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"", the Coens are at their best.Joel and Ethan Coen gathered one of the best group of performers to be in the film. George Clooney is seen as Ulysses, or Odysseus in the Greek epic, the man at the center of the action. Never has this actor been given this great opportunity and he has responded in ways that bowled us in watching him portray his character on the screen. To say this is his best work in the movies, is perhaps not saying anything at all! Mr. Clooney can thank the Coens for trusting in him and giving him the role of his career.The rest of the cast is perfection. Most of the players are part of the Coen's troupe of talented players at their disposal to give life to their characters in film. John Turturro, John Goodman and Holly Hunter have been in other films by the brothers and shine in this movie. Tim Blake Nelson, Charles Durning, Del Pentecost, and Daniel Von Bargen, among others do extraordinary work for the Coen team.The musical score by T Bone Burnett is what makes this movie unique. The use of the music works so well with the film as does Mr. Clooney's singing. Roger Deakins' cinematography also adds a rich texture to the story.A must see for all Coen brothers fans!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Don't expect Homer but plain sympathic Humor,"I did not expect too much of this movie, but it's often these movies that give you a really good time watching them - so did O Brother Where Art Thou.OK, I have to admit, you can hardly consider this film a ""big one"", as the jokes are often on a really low level, but that's just the kind of humour the Coen Bros intended to use, and it makes the movie, as for me, really really enjoyable.Well, that Homer- and Odysseus-thing in the marketing seems way too emphasized to me, as I could only find some parallels to Homer's ancient poems that you could find, with a little effort, in dozens of today's films (the siren-scene even seems to be taken into the movie only to justify the use of this big poets name, as it does not really fit the rest of the story...), but, well, I didn't except to watch a literature adaption, but an entertaining, funny movie, and that's what I got - and much better than I expected.The concept is not a new one, Clooney as the educated rascal with the heart in the right place and tons of rustical sayings that relativate his educated impression, but it is put into practice in an ironic, sometimes naive, but always sympathic way - and that's what you watch movies for, the impression that they leave, not a consistent story or a moral realization (which this movie does not claim to transport).After all, you are left with a movie that is just fun watching, not only for the jokes, but also for the beautiful pictures and the bizarre characters. It's hard for me to tell what this film told me, but I liked the way I was told it. Why aren't there more of these films?",,Anonymous,Crime
Puzzling...,"O Brother, where art thou? seems to be a combination of two different movies.1. A hilarious ridiculous account of three escaped stumblebum convicts searching for mythical treasure2. A dull boring tedious short pastiche of southern governors and spin-doctors.The fact that the two stories collide at the end is really rather irrelevant.I loved the first movie. It was hilarious, clever, beautiful and starred George Clooney in fine form, John Turturro and the wonderful Tim Blake Nelson.The second movie was, as far as I could see (maybe I missed the joke) boring, pointless and unfunny. No disrespect to the actors, but to the writer.O brother is essentially a good film, if it were not for the sub-plot. Nevertheless, it is bearable the first time and the three leads almost make up for it entirely, making the incredible credible. Also the cinematography is beautiful and the plot quirks are worth an essay of praise in themselves.7 out of 10:Don't see it at the cinema, rent it on video, if only for the use of the fast-forward button.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
You're gonna love this movie,"This depression era period piece is simply a delight. The music is wonderful; the fanciful, on the road story of lovable escaped convict country bumpkins, who pratfall their way through numerous scrapes invites hilarity; and the beautifully dove-tailed script by the Coen brothers is marvelous.That script was nominated for the Oscar for Best Screenplay based on material from another medium for 2001, but didn't win. (Stephen Gaghan won for Traffic.) But never mind. The writing is just so clever and that is part of what makes this movie so much fun to watch.That won't surprise viewers who are familiar with the work of Ethan and Joel Coen. Those guys are strikingly original talents who can write comedy and noir with the best of them as in, e.g., Raising Arizona (1987), Blood Simple (1984)--their first, and in some ways, their best--and of course Fargo (1996). Their work is characterized by irony, satirical intent, and sly plotting in which later events are foreshadowed by previous events. O, Brother, Where Art Thou? is especially replete with clever foreshadowing. Characters appear, as they are wont to do in road movies or epic wanderings, and then they are left behind as our heroes move on. Here however, the first appearance of a character is probably not the last appearance. When John Goodman first appears as a morally and ethnically-challenged Bible salesman who welds a mean stick, we may think he is gone, but (I'll keep this vague) when he reappears we are not surprised; in fact his reappearance is just right.One of the highlights is George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill whose sweet-smelling Dapper Dan hair pomade plays a bit of a role in the plot. He is perfect as a slick-talking, hairnet-wearing country wordsmith who could charm the birds out of the trees. With the slicked-back hair and the thin moustache, he reminded me a bit of Clark Gable, which is only right since Gable was a thirties film star whose style was much imitated.Clooney is supported by John Turturro, who has played in at least two other Coen and Coen movies that I have seen. He is one of those non-glamorous actors who is at the top of the profession. It may seem a bit of a casting stretch to play him as a Mississippi bumpkin, but he pulls it off. This is the same guy who was just perfect as a New York Jewish writer gone to Hollywood in Coen and Coen's Barton Fink (1991).This is the first time I've seen Tim Blake Nelson, but he was also very good as the third country musketeer. As usual the alluring Holly Hunter gives a solid performance as Everett's estranged wife about to marry another man, the mother of his six daughters. But make no mistake about it, Clooney clearly steals the show, and I am surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor. He was really that good. (He did win a Golden Globe award.) And the music: country, bluegrass, hillbilly, gospel, traditional--and I know not what else--is really at the heart of the flick. When the ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" come on with their ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" it really brings the house down. The Coens know this, and so later in the movie when the boys appear on stage, looking a little like ZZTop on a budget, they reprise it to the delight of the Mississippi folk at a political rally and really get the joint to jumping--and of course it all figures in the plot. And how appropriate is that lyric for a depression era song: ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow""! See this for both the Coen Brothers who know how to have fun with a movie, and for George Clooney, who puts on a mighty good show.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

There were so many character actor roles in this, that at times it got a bit tiring to watch. Kinda like The Grinch Whole Stole Christmas, but nowhere as bad.The movie picks itself back up from Clooney's bootstraps and he and Holly Hunter (who had a way too small role in this) show us how these types of roles are done.

"One of the worst movies released in a long time; pointless, and absolutely moronic. * (out of four).","The Coen brothers are very gifted filmmakers. Considering some of my all time favorite movies, including ""Fargo,"" ""Blood Simple,"" and ""Raising Arizona,"" were products of their excessive capability of making good productions only contributes to the enormous disappointment of their latest effort, ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?"" It is as if they took several bad actors to play bad characters thrown in a bad script with bad dialogue and bad situations. Everything about this movie is bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. The movie is a complete waste of 106 minutes of your life. It makes sitting on the couch watching ""Survivor"" look good. I am sorry to say this but I may hold this one against the Coen brothers for some time to come.""Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?"" is your standard road/buddy comedy, but missing comedy, laughs, insight, and interest. The story feels tedious, yawn-inducing, slow-moving and ridiculously stupid. It takes place in 1937, in Mississippi where three convicts escape from a pretty chain gang. They are Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Delmar (Time Blake Nelson), and Pete (John Turturro), who quickly find themselves discussing their dreams with a crazy blind seer. This man explains the three escapees must travel a long and difficult path before they find a treasure at the bottom of a lake in four days. Being the absolute idiots they are, Pete, McGill, and Delmar find themselves following the advice of this clearly eccentric drifter.The three idiots are pursued by various other characters, including a local sheriff (Daniel Von Bargen) who's bound and determined to bring the criminals to justice, a young musician (Chris Thomas King) who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for musical abilities, George ""Baby Face"" Nelson (Michael Badalucco), a manic depressive bank robber with machine guns up the wazoo, Big Dan Teague (John Goodman), a deceptive one-eyed bible salesman, and incumbent Governor Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning) in a close campaign with Homer Stokes (Wayne DuVall), whose manager (Ray McKinnon) is married to McGill's ex-wife, Penny (Holly Hunter).""Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?"" is a moronic shadow of ""Of Mice and Men,"" minus the legitimate plot and defined character intentions. This film contains the most annoying of characters; they are bland, boring, dual, dumb, negative-adjective inspiring. What is that you say? The movie's intentions were to induce laughs through the stupidity of the characters? Well, if that were the case I think I would have laughs, or even smiled at that. I found myself moaning and groaning in disgust and agony. Not a single character is the least bit intriguing. That is one of the biggest problems the movie makes, finding a character in which audiences can relate. Maybe if the characters were introduced or developed, or had the slightest interesting personality, then there may have been some involvement.albeit not much.The dialogue is typical redneck blahblah, wooden and straightforward. There is little creativity or sharpness in the writing. The screenplay, by Joel and Ethan Coen, based on a poem by Homer, puts you right to sleep, especially in the scenes where the outlaws sit around campfires exchanging depressing, meaningless gibber jabber. The soundtrack is equally as painful, consisting of irritating old-fashion country music, and even some numbers sang by the characters themselves. Those scenes, dragged on way too long, are irrelevant to the story. All of these horrible qualities precede an ending that is not satisfying and inconclusive.""Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?"" is just a really dumb movie; there is no other way to explain the quality. It is just really dumb. Not in a funny way. Not in a slapstick way. Not even in a bad movie sort of way. It is inexplicably dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Oh, yeah, did I mention that this movie is dumb.

"Come on, it was BETTER than ""Fargo.""","I guess I'll be different, and say that I don't usually like Coen Brothers movies, but I liked this one.

A Top Notch Flick,"Alright, folks... here's your riddle of the day: Whaddaya get if you cross the Three Stooges with the Greek poet Homer?""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" that's what!Here is another superb comedy finely crafted by screenwriters /producers/ directors Joel and Ethan Coen. Starring George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro, it features a brilliantly written script, superb acting by a wonderful ensemble cast, and a musical score that's simply second to none.""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a simple story really... set in the Mississippi delta region during the Great Depression, it's the tale of three petty criminals who escape from the chain gang in quest of buried treasure and experience a series of misadventures along the way. Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) is the silver-tongued, self-appointed leader of this odd trio, a man who claims to have stolen and buried over a million dollars in cash. Delmar O'Donnell is the docile, sweet-tempered dimwit (played to perfection by Tim Blake Nelson). The third member of our little gang is an irritable, acerbic fella named Pete. Together they set off, chained to each other, in search of McGill's treasure, which is buried somewhere about to become a man-made lake. Our heroes have only four days to find the loot before it's lost forever at the bottom of the newly created reservoir.As they begin their journey, the run across an old blind seer who prophesies that they will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. with a posse of law enforcement officers and vigilantes hot on their heels, Everett, Pete and Delmar ditch their chains and prison garb and continue on their quest.Our trio's journey is anything but quiet and uneventful. They continually run into strange people and situations... At one point, soon after stealing a car and picking up a guitar-playing hitch-hiker, they stop at a local radio station and, posing as an ""old-timey"" music group called the ""Soggy Bottom Boys,"" they cut a record that's soon all the rage throughout the region. Later they encounter a Baptist congregation at river's edge, singing a beautiful song, lulling our heroes into sweet forgetfulness for a few brief moments. They happen upon three washer-women, also at river's edge, whose siren-like song ensnares our three miscreants... George Nelson, a bank robber on the run, who nearly co-opts our heroes into a REAL life of crime... the one-eyed, fast-talking Bible salesman Dan Teague (played by John Goodman) who offers Everett, Pete, and Delmar a hard lesson on economics and life in general in the Depression-ravaged Deep South... and other characters as well: Governor Pappy ""Pass the Biscuits"" O'Daniel, running for re-election against a reform-minded candidate named Homer Stokes... Everett's ex-wife Penny, soon to me re-married to a real drone named Vernon Waldrip... and a whole gang of fellas dressed in white sheets and hoods who take exception to our heroes' intrusion into their ceremonies.One of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou's?"" greatest strengths is its musical score. As the Coen brothers point out, nary a scene goes by without some kind of music in the background. The songs - 19 of them by my count - are all wonderful. It's a sublime mixture of old-time gospel and country music and African-American spirituals. From James Carter and the Prisoners' ""Po' Lazarus,"" through Alison Krause's sweetly simple and reverent ""Down to the River to Pray"" (with brilliant harmonies added by the First Baptist Choir of White House, Tennessee); the old-time country classics ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" and ""Hard Rock Candy Mountain,"" and ""You Are My Sunshine;"" to the old-time Gospel classics ""Keep On the Sunny Side;"" ""I'll Fly Away"" and ""I Am Weary (Let Me Rest),"" (and many other songs as well), the music adds an extra dimension to this already multi-faceted film. (By the way, all these songs can be found on the ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" soundtrack compact disc... but that's another review!)I've now watched ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" about a dozen times. Each viewing has been a genuine pleasure for me. This film is clever in its conception, extraordinary in its execution, sublime in its storytelling, and masterful in its music. In short... wonderfully entertaining in every respect. A definite ""must-see"" for movie-lovers everywhere!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The most accessible and enjoyable Coen brothers movie to date,"I have yet to see a Coen brothers movie I didn't like, but I can see how some of their work can be a little too esoteric for some (e.g. the wonderfully strange 'Barton Fink'). 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' however, is their most accessible and downright entertaining movie to date, and should appeal to a wide range of viewers. A typically eccentric Coen premise - Homer retold as a Depression musical comedy - it manages to be consistently funny and warm without losing any of their trademark quirks and wit. George Clooney steals the show with one of his  best performances (equal to 'Three Kings' in my opinion), and is wonderfully backed up by Coen regular John Turturro ('Do The Right Thing') and relative new comer Tim Blake Nelson. The three make a classic comedy team ala The Three Stooges. The rest of the first rate supporting cast includes many familiar faces from previous Coen films (John Goodman, Holly Hunter, etc) as well as the underrated Daniel von Bargen ('Lord Of Illusions, 'Desert Blue') and 'Wild At Heart' weirdo Frank Collison. This movie is a joy from start to finish. I loved it and would recommend it to anybody who is looking for a genuinely funny and clever comedy.",,Anonymous,Crime
Not really Homer,"The Homeric parallels are very thin, very over-hyped, and don't go much further than calling the main guy Ulysses and his wife Penny. The real Penelope didn't get engaged to anyone else while Odysseus was away. She knew he would come back, and wanted him to come back. The film is more a picaresque tale in the didactic style of Voltaire.Look, say the Coen brothers, here is this aspect of the Depression, here is another; here are Baptists, here is a rough gubernatorial campaign, here an early radio station, here a bent Bible salesman, here the KKK; see how wittily we touch on each and make it quaint by stringing them along our loose little tale of convicts looking for treasure, using very old and rather wonderful songs that we didn't write, but which are well out of copyright, so we didn't have to pay for them.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"One of a kind, a ""must see"" movie","O Brother where art thou? is one of my favorite movies, it has a story like none other. From the very beginning of the movie it catches your attention and never lets go, the movie does not have any ""slow periods"" where nothing seems to happen. The movie twists and turns and introduces small stories within the story, you will never be able to guess what happens next, unless you already have seen the movie. The characters all have their own well defined personality, and seems very vivid in the hands of the talented actors, many of the characters has small lines you remember long after you have seen the movie, such as ""I'm a Dapper dan man"", ""care for some gopher?"", ""Damn, were in a tight spot"" and ""she R-U-N-O-F-T"".The movie is not a musical but it is ""song rich"". Throughout the movie songs appear, many sung by the main actors, and done so very well. Personally I think it boosts the movie making it more fun to watch. The movie is a modern version of homers ""odyssey"", and in many scenes  you will recognize things from homers book, I will not mention what, you will have to find them yourself.All I'm really trying to say is, ""watch this movie because there are none other like it and it is excellent"".",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Ulysses on the road, again!","Though The Coen Brothers admitted that they have not read Homer's The Odyssey, there are conspicuous references in the film which makes you question if they did indeed read it or not, one of them is the representation of Poseidon, the sheriff, as they both continuously work to defeat Ulysses/Odysseus. In Coen Brothers' adventure- comedy film ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Ulysses (George Clooney) flees his hard-labor sentence in 1930's Mississippi with his fellow criminals, Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), and Pete (John Turturro). Their adventures begin as they come across a blind seer who encourages them to take the journey to find a treasure which is the adventure itself. With its captivating soundtracks, chaotic energy of the characters, and its take on race discrimination it makes you want to keep on watching. Although I liked the film for aforementioned reasons, comparing to the epic I expected it to be a drama movie. Its accuracy is surprising given that the Coen Brothers have not read the epic but if we were to take it as a strict adaptation of The Odyssey, a much accurate version could have been made changing either the setting or the plotline. Altogether, labeling it as a loose adaptation, I would recommend this film if you wanted to have some quality time spend laughing.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"And You Thought ""Planet of the Apes"" Was Bad!","This is an awful film.But first, an historical note:  The Confederate battle flag is the centerpiece of an ugly scene in this film involving the Ku Klux Klan.  For the record, the Confederate battle flag was NEVER associated with the Ku Klux Klan during its heyday.  If you take the time to look at any of the news reels from the 1920's and 1930's, including film clips of the thousands of robed klansmen marching down Washington, D.C.'s Constitution Avenue, the only flag you will see is ""Old Glory.""  The Confederate battle flag was MISAPPROPRIATED in the late 1950's and in the 1960's by groups opposing the integration of the public schools and, later, by the handful of ""yahoos"" in this country who claim to be sepratists and Aryans, ad nauseum.  The point is that Hollywood's fixation on the Confederate battle flag as a symbol of evil is a continuing slander on the memory of millions of Americans who fought for independence.But, back to the film.  I dislike the Coens because they are not just mannered, they are pretentious.  Come on, folks.  Be honest.  The Coens are indulging themselves.  And we, that small slice of the movie-going public with the brain cells to write a review, are letting them get away with it.The story?  What story?  It's just a series of scenes.  Unless you know something about Southern American history, the movie makes absolutely no sense.  Even then, it's a reach.  The ""story"" takes place in Mississippi, but the real Governor Pappy (""Pass the biscuits, please"") O'Daniel was a Texan, and the film's theme song, ""You are my Sunshine,"" was written by Louisiana's Depression-era governor, Jimmy Davis.  Symptomatic with the way Hollywood views the South, I suppose the Coens are trying to cover it all in one film.The characters?  George Clooney is laughable as Ulysses Everett McGill. This man obviously never spent one day on a chain gang, or one day in the South, pretend or otherwise.  Burt Reynolds would have been better, but then the art house crowd would never have gone for it.  Holly Hunter?  Her pained expressions were all too real, I am afraid.  She has no direction, no scenes, no lines, no personality, and no interest in the film.  And what a waste!  She's a real Southerner with a real Southern charm and attitude.Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar O'Donnell is just too painful to watch.  He had me wishing the witches had turned HIM into a toad.  But, on the other hand, he represents the Coens' view of Southern people, so his performance is not atypical.  Charles Durning is completely wasted as Gov. O'Daniel.  The man has some range, but here he is just a one-note blowhard.  (Remember him in ""The Sting"" and in ""Tootsie""?)  John Goodman?  Oh, please.I did not care about any of the characters.  I thought the Coens were going to do something with Tommy Johnson (played by Chris Thomas), thinking perhaps that he would be the Coens' version of ""Leadbelly,"" but he makes no contribution.  We know nothing about him.  In the end, he's just a black guy with a guitar.  Michael Baldacci's turn as ""Baby Face"" Nelson is filler.Not surprisingly, it is hard to like ANYBODY in this film, which is characteristic of a film by the Coens.The film did win a couple of Oscars, including one for cinematography. But how?  Many of the daytime scenes are hazy and desperately in need of a filter, and those outdoor shots that are attractive, are no more attractive than the outdoor scenes you see in a typical episode of ""The Crocodile Hunter.""I wonder what Tim Burton is up to these days?",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Needs Rewatching,"Every time I watch a Coen Brothers flick I walk away feeling unsatisfied with my initial viewing (with the exception of Fargo, the brilliance of which is explicit). In the case of No Country For Old Men and The Big Lebowski I recall being very eager to start over, almost immediately as the final credits rolled. With O Brother, Where Art Thou? however I don't feel so ready to rewatch right away. My enjoyment of my first viewing was lacking somewhat compared to Lebowski and NCFOM. Nonetheless I will ensure I give OBWAT a second chance at some point to see if my initial rating can be boosted.I didn't particularly care much for the soundtrack, which is getting a lot of praise amongst other reviewers. I've read comments suggesting the film grows on you as it progresses, which I agree with but must note it takes over an hour of runtime before this takes effect. Before Clooney's revelation about the truth behind his ""buried treasure"" (which with some prior knowledge of Homer's Odyssey would not come as a shock or twist at all to the viewer) the film presents itself as one disjointed scene after another. I would actually recommend researching a brief summary of Odyssey before watching OBWAT, as I feel this could make certain scenes and characters seem less random and therefore more enjoyable. For instance John Goodman's cameo does not seem so bizarre upon reflection, having now garnered some awareness of Odysseus' foe the cyclops.Credit where it's due, O Brother, Where Art Thou? does serve well as a comedy and I did find myself laughing throughout. And kudos to the Coen Brothers for managing to tie up every loose end of their rambling sketch show-like story. My overall enjoyment of the film is reflected in my rating however, and until I get round to rewatching O Brother, Where Art Thou? I must stick with 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Most memorable movie experience!,"Like the rhapsodes who stitched together tales to form the Odyssey, the Coen brothers have brought together Homer, blues and bluegrass, George Clooney, and digital photography to create a modern-day epic-comedy. The first 12 minutes feature the memorable opening scene (which I understand uses the soundtrack from a real chain gang), the highly amusing song ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"" and the train scene which makes me laugh out loud every time I see it. In fact, this is all I saw the first time in the theater, due to a power outage. My husband and I received a voucher and couldn't wait to see the entire movie the next day -- based on only the first twelve minutes! I saw the movie in Louisiana, and ""You are my sunshine"" was written by our former Governor Jimmy Davis. I got a lump in my throat when the entire audience began singing ""You are my Sunshine."" O Brother is based on Homer's Odyssey, and it's a fun parlor game to see how many episodes from the Odyssey you can recognize (John Goodman playing the Cyclops is the most obvious). The one thing missing: they need a voodoo priestess to play the role of Circe to try and change the frog back into Pete! One word of warning (not a spoiler): There are two instances of animal brutality that are hard to watch (but it's obvious what's going to happen).The DVD is a must-have... it shows how they took the verdant Mississippi countryside and digitally enhanced it to make it look like the dustbowl of the 1930s.Film buffs will recognize tributes to Cool Hand Luke and the Wizard of Oz, among others.

1st Rate Coen Humor!!,"I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers' work and was therefore quite anxious to view their latest project.  I was first hooked with their 1987 cult-classic, Raising Arizona, and this was right up there with it.  I will admit that with the Coens, you either love them or you don't, and if you didn't enjoy their past projects then you will probably not be amused by this one.  I must say that this film was done a great unjustice by the Academy Awards this year  Nonetheless, I found it hysterical and this is one I will definately pounce on when it hits DVD.Doctor Ross no more, George Clooney has found his niche.  He has an incredible nack for humor and comedic timing and he kept me laughing at every turn.  His very Clark Gable-ish character was impecable!  Perhaps the best performance in the movie was that of Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar.  He was a scream!!  His facial expressions alone were enough to put me in stitches and when he opened his mouth he only got funnier.  Clooney, Nelson, and John Turturro made and excellent on-screen team.Other notable actors in supporting roles include John Goodman as the archetypical Cyclops character, ""Big Dan"" Teague, Charles Durning as Pappy O'Daniel, Holly Hunter, who is always superb)plays Penny Wharvey McGill (Clooney's wife), and Ray McKinnon as Vernon T.

John Turturro Tim Blake Nelson do a wonderful job of playing affable dimwits, and Clooney puts in a top-notch performance as a flim-flam artist who's about as dumb as his two fellow escapees . . . he just knows more high-falutin' words that make him sound smart.  The other cast members are equally impressive -- Charles Durning, John Goodman, and Michael Badaluco all put in some stunning performances as well.Like most Joel and Ethan Coen movies, the story is both bizarre and highly entertaining, with some memorable one-liners punctuating some equally memorable scenes.  (""We're in a tight spot!"") Where the movie falls short of some of their other efforts is the overall plot -- ""O Brother"" is more a mishmash of loosely related scenes than an actual story; as such, it sometimes drags or otherwise fails to grab your attention.

"CU Film Critic Takes on ""O Brother, Where Art Thou.""","Looking back on my freshman year of high school, I probably would have enjoyed Homer's `Odyssey' a sight more had it featured a character named `Wash Hogwallop.' The Coen Brothers, Joel and Ethan, have once again busted out the big guns. `Raising Arizona,' `Fargo,' `The Big Lebowski' (quite possibly the funniest film ever made) and now `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' Starring George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson, `O Brother' is a 1920's take on `The Odyssey' by Homer, albeit with wagonloads of artistic license.  Absconding from the chain gang to which they were sentenced for various trivial crimes, Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney), Pete (Turturro) and Delmar (Nelson) are on the trail of hidden loot from a bank heist years previous.  In the tradition of Joel and Ethan Coen, they are beset on their way by sirens, a cyclops, the Ku Klux Klan, Baptists, and a young guitar player who has recently sold his soul to the devil.As we've come to expect from the Coens, they've thrown out all vestiges of conventional plot in favor of glorious, off-center characters.  Clooney's McGill is the goofy, but philosophical father figure, seeming to possess an educated mind uncharacteristic of a habitual criminal.  His will to live is proportional to the amount of Dapper Dan Pomade remaining in his can.  John Turturro is probably best remembered for his role as Jesus Quintana in `The Big Lebowski,' (though, to be fair, I feel he was overlooked by the Academy for his work in Blockbuster Video's `Beginner's Guide to the Internet'). He adds yet another nut-bar character to his repertoire with Pete, who at one point may or may not have been turned into a toad.  Delmar, probably the film's least memorable character, was nonetheless given a healthy injection of hick charm by Nelson.  When it comes to supporting actors, you can't go wrong with John Goodman.  I'll give you the joy of meeting his character on your own- no need to give everything away. I've been waiting for weeks to use the word `stupendous.'  It just rolls off the tongue.  The soundtrack was stupendous. I think I'll go buy it now. Probably the most important thing to note about `O Brother' is the fact that in the hands of any other filmmakers, it would have been a complete disaster.  The Coens have mastered the art of leaving their audience unfulfilled, while ensuring at the same time that their audience is content and even gratified to be feeling that way. While `O Brother' is nothing groundbreaking, it's a pleasant diversion from the tried and true formula.  The Coens undoubtedly are able to go to sleep each night knowing that they've accomplished new things for film, which is more than I can say for most directors today.  `O Brother' may not be a popcorn blockbuster.  That's all right.  I'll even say that whether I enjoyed it or not, it may not be your cup of tea.  If you didn't like `Fargo,' you probably won't appreciate `O Brother, Where Art Thou?'For fans of Joel and Ethan Coen, however, there is much to be appreciated here.  `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' gets a'B+.'  It's no Lebowski, but I'd sure watch it again.  And again.  If you're a newcomer to Coen fare, keep this in mind.  As the film opens, Ulysses, Pete and Delmar come upon an old prophet.  He tells them that `you will find a treasure, but it is not the treasure that you seek.'  How true.",,Anonymous,Crime

"O Brother, Where Art Thou is a rather unusual offbeat road picture that is somewhat entertaining.","I'm not entirely sure how to review this flick. Don't get me wrong, it was enjoyable but something was missing that prevented this from being great. Essentially three chain-mates, who crush rocks on a prison farm, escape in an attempt to find buried treasure. But, in typical Coen fashion, the group go from one crazy scenario to the other. Constantly. From recording a country song for some cash, to getting robbed by a one-eyed Bible Salesman. From being seduced by sexy sirens, to being disguised in KKK uniform. It's just crazy fun. But there is just something about the narrative that seems...off. Like I wasn't fully connected with this biblical journey that's filled with religious connotations. I mean heck, the main character is named Ulysses. I just...didn't get the purpose of the biblical context. As a road caper, it's extremely enjoyable with plenty of humorous moments. Boasted with energetic performances by Clooney, Nelson and Turturro. Great supporting cast as well with dependable performances from Goodman and Hunter. The scenarios that our characters are put under are also hilarious and instantly memorable. As simple as falling from a train is, it still produces a good laugh. Hence why I admire the simplicity that Joel Coen was going for. It's not over-the-top slapstick humour, it's all in the dialogue. The Coen brothers pump out scripts that are consistently witty for every film they produce. They are known for damn good dialogue and this film is no different. I just...couldn't get on board with the context and subtext that was conveyed. Just didn't work for me. But as a hilarious adventure road flick, it works on every level.

Not sure what to make of it...,"The Coen brothers continually astound me... and I'm not sure if that is a good thing. Every time I think I've figured them or their films out, they pull one over on me. The Hudsucker Proxy had some great humor, but was mostly a homage to old comedies. Fargo was somewhat weird and oddly repetitive, but had plenty of great humor. The Man Who Wasn't There is an excellent noir film. Intolerable Cruelty was very funny. All of them had great writing and dialog. Then, around comes this... what is it, anyway? A fresh interpretation of The Odyssey? The film revolves around Everett, a man on the run from the law with the other two thirds of his chain gang. He goes through many trials and tribulations throughout the just over 90 minutes the film lasts, until the conflict is finally resolved. The plot is fine, but there seems to be a nearly unlimited number of characters that just show up, serve their purpose and disappear. The pacing is daft. The characters are fairly well-written and credible. The dialog and script is well-written, as is expected from the Coen's. The acting is very good all-round. The humor works some of the time. The quirkiness of some characters makes for some good laughs, but that's about it. All in all, a fairly forgettable Coen brothers' film.

Best Of Legendary Roger Deakins,"Hands down the best shot movies. Coen Brothers surely knows how to make south funny. By far one of the best films I have ever seen. Have you ever been asked the question, what movie could you watch over and over again? For me, that movie would be O Brother, Where Art Thou?",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Good Time,"O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? is a well balanced, good time flick.The action/adventure is balanced very with the comedy, with a little hint of romance tossed in.  The story (loosely based on Homer's epic poem ODYSSEY) is very entertaining.  The music was outstanding.I only had two complaints.  First, the Coen brothers tried to hard to make this picture ""cute"" or ""off-the-wall.""  By setting the adventure story in the depression-era south the way they did, they did not have to expend all that effort and energy.  The nature of the idea alone could have carried it off by itself.Second, George Clooney's acting was terrible.  He portrayed his role as a charicature as opposed to a character.  And that was completely out of step with the whole rest of the movie.But in the end these complaints are trivial in comparison to the final result which is an overall good time.Now it is time for me to go out and buy that soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Funny, and evokes an era","I've always liked this Coen Bros. production - the fantastic folk music, the Americana applied to an inverted version of The Odyssey, and those three lovable convicts on the run (George Clooney, John Turturro, and good old Tim Blake Nelson as dimwitted Delmar). The moment they become the Soggy Bottom Boys singing into a ""can"" always makes me smile, as do all of their little idiosyncrasies, like the loquaciousness of Clooney's character and his penchant for Dapper Dan pomade. I didn't care for the subplot involving the politician quite as much, but it does allow another dimension to the satire of racism, showing the Reform candidate to be a part of the Klan, and the incumbent to then gleefully take advantage of his missteps, without really caring for people of color in the slightest. The film has a great look and feel to it, and even though the story is contrived, the comedy comes through and it evokes an era.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fun to watch!,"The first thing that struck me about O Brother, Where Art Thou? was the locations. The Coen brothers did a stellar job of portraying the Mississippi of this time period as I have always imagined it would look. It makes me want to seek out these parts of my state myself, just to see what true rural Mississippi once looked like.The second thing that caught my attention about this movie is how over-the-top it is. That will automatically make it unpleasant for some, but it became endearing for me after only a short time. Yes, George Clooney's accent doesn't work nearly as well as John Turturro's or Tim Blake Nelson's, but after a while it all seems to fit and just seems right.The third element that stands out about O Brother is the songs. Awesome. Every scene is highlighted by some of the most kick-ass, old-timey tunes known to man. Anyone who doesn't want the soundtrack after seeing the movie is just being contrary.The fact that this is loosely based on The Odyssey is only occasionally apparent, but the story that is here is more than enough to entertain. Every new character is captivating, no matter how long or brief their screen time.The movies starts off brilliantly, sags a bit toward the middle, and then finishes fairly strong. It's not quite consistent enough to be a classic, but I definitely would like to see it again. O Brother, Where Art Thou? is just a lot of fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Coen Brothers do it again,"What a movie, I saw it at the Film By The Sea festival and fell in love with it. It starts with a black screen while hearing a song (one might instantly recognise a chaingang song) and is we get a picture it is a chaingang, singing and hitting rocks. The picture looks authentic, a bit vague, the mood is set. And that is what this movie was to me, a good mood. I LOVED the soundtrack and I wish and I hope that it will be available. I ( as America in the movie) was crazy about the song of The Soggy Bottom Boys, if anyone knows where I can find it and if there was an original by whom it was, drop me a line.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""You guys are dumber than a bag of hammers.""","Adapting the epic Homer poem ""The Odyssey"", the Coen brothers refashion it as a tale set in Mississippi in the 30s. Three unlikely comrades - the very talkative Ulysses (George Clooney), the bad-tempered Pete (John Turturro), and the easygoing Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) - escape from a chain gang and take it on the lam. Their primary aim would seem to be recovering a ""treasure"" that Ulysses squirreled away a while back.While the Coens' story does tend to be very episodic, the segments are always colorful, always lively, and often offbeat and *very* funny. The film-making brothers devised a truly witty script, with plenty of florid dialogue for Clooney to utter. The various episodes include the boys being enticed by sirens, victimized by a shady Bible salesman (John Goodman), befriending a guitarist (Chris Thomas King) who says he has sold his soul to the Devil, later saving King from a lynching by the Klan, and even becoming recording stars with a soulful rendition of the traditional ""I am a Man of Constant Sorrow"".Clooney, Turturro, and Nelson are hilarious, and make an ideal team of oddballs, and they receive superb support from a typically eclectic Coen brothers cast: Holly Hunter, Charles Durning, Michael Badalucco, Wayne Duvall (Robert D's nephew), Ed Gale, Ray McKinnon, Daniel von Bargen, Royce D. Applegate, Frank Collison, Lee Weaver, and Stephen Root. The late Durning is particularly fun as a blustery politician.Creative through and through, gorgeously shot by the always reliable Roger Deakins, and barely pausing to take a breath, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" remains one of the Coens' most ingratiating yarns. The irresistible soundtrack is just the icing on the cake (and, in fact, was an even bigger hit than the motion picture).10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Love it or Hate it,"My favourite Coen Brothers film to date is the Big Lebowski.  I thought Fargo, their most acclaimed movie so far, was a waste of time.  And that's usually the way it is with their movies.  You either love 'em or hate 'em. But this time, with O Brother, I found that I don't love it or hate it; I just like it.  I give it a 7 out of 10 so far.  I say so far because I've only watched it once, and watching a Coen Brothers movie is like reading a Kafka short story---there's so much there that you can't pick up on all of it the first time.  Greater appreciation comes from repeated viewings. And some people will never really get it; it's not for the immediate-gratification crowd and never will be.  That said, having watched O Brother only once, my summary is this:  There's virtually no narrative to the story; it's just a bunch of stuff that happens.  Therefore it's not as engaging as could be had there been a stronger narrative pull, and some people will think it's boring; there are some slow parts.  But when it is funny, it's hilarious, especially George Clooney's character who cracked me up just about every time he opened his mouth.  At the moment I wouldn't put it up there with the Big Lebowski, but the laughs, when they come, are so strong that it easily worth the price of admission/rental.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Easily the most enjoyable movie I've seen in years,"The earliest memory I have is hearing my mother sing, ""You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. . .

Go listen to the samples at amazon:  If you find this stuff hopelessly cornpone, then save yourself the aggravation and see a brain-dead action thriller instead.

It has everything from the movie and more.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great movie,"Since I loved ""The Big Lebowski"" so much I felt the urge to buy this movie as well, and it might not be as great as ""Big Lebowski"", but it sure is great! The Coen brothers just make excellent movies!George Clooney delivers a load of funny lines throughout the movie, and can't seem to stay serious for 5 seconds. John Torturro and Tim Blake Nelson aren't quite as funny tho, its basicly up to Clooney and the characters they meet to keep the comedy feel up. But the scene where Nelson discovers the toad is just a killer!On their journey to stop a marriage they encounter many strange people, and lots of other stuff. Klu Klux Klan for example... Or George (Baby Face) Nelson. John Goodman also plays a role here, but he's not that funny, compared to his role in ""Big Lebowski"", but its always fun seeing Goodman around!The soundtrack, as with all other Coen movies, is great!

Good film but not the Coens at their best.,"This film is not of the same class as 'The Big Lebowski' or 'Fargo'. However, the period recreations are excellent and the lead performances, especially John Turturro's. The link with Homer is interesting but the film tends to drone on and I don't feel caught up in the usual Coen brothers intrigue.An excellent musical soundtrack carries the film along, but sometimes the displaced and surreal personal viewpoints that the Coen brothers project in their films fails to captivate in this instance. Hilarious KKK choreography, but the 'irony' of Everett being an astute social commentator as well as a convict has become an annoying cliche in Coen movies, where the most unlikely people talk in sociological language i.e. Lazar in 'Miller's Crossing'. I was slightly disappointed with this movie but with the Coens another masterpiece may be around the corner. The cinema would be a duller place without them.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Second viewing no better than the first, crude and lacking appeal","First saw this Coen Brothers movie around the time it came out, or shortly after it was released for rental ... I can't remember. Wrote it off as a disappointing film, one of several from the brothers whose work is inconsistent: sometimes great, but all too frequently fair or nothing special.However, some friends kept mentioning it, quoting lines from it, cracking each other up saying that - like Monty Python's Holy Grail - it grows on you. So I gave it another chance.Oh well.The second time around I found it worse than disappointing; I found it offensive. The movie should be rated R for the number of times it takes the Lord's name in vain. I almost turned it off but, as I'm apt to do no matter how bad a movie is, I stuck it out until the bitter end, which means I had to suffer through the blasphemous KKK scene.O Brother Where Art Thou doesn't work as a comedy (I know I didn't laugh, and am not even sure I smiled) or as a drama. It lacks a sympathetic character (Tim Blake Nelson comes the closest, and it's hard not to like Holly Hunter in anything) or even any memorable scenes.Yes, there are the typical Coen Brothers' eccentric characters and references to classic stories (Homer) and movies (like Cool Hand Luke) but, instead of enhancing this film or honoring the past, they just don't work. I suppose - as my friends mentioned - there are some repeatable lines (smugly delivered by George Clooney's character, no surprise there), but why would one want to be reminded of this forgetful film?",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
A long Journey Home,"""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Movie Review
by Brooke Dupree
Directors:
Joel Coen, Ethan Coen (uncredited)
Writers:
Homer (epic poem ""The Odyssey""), Ethan Coen
Stars:
George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman, Holly HunterAnyone who has read Homer's Odyssey knows that Odysseus's journey is wracked with obstacles. Odysseus's internal battle with his ego and his desire to go home to his family is the inspiration for the Coen Brothers successful portrayal of the journey of Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), and his two fellow escaped convicts in ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" (2000).Everett's obsession with his hair and his know-it-all tendencies lead he and his two dimwitted jail mates, Pete (John Torturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) as they search for a secret treasure through the deep south during the Great Depression. Just like in The Odyssey, they come across their fair share of hurdles, the ultimate of which being the Lawman, hot on their trail, which leads the audience through their ridiculous pitfalls, narrowly escaping the law, accompanying bank robbers, and losing one of their friends to the Sirens.There are two ways one could view this film and be either disappointed or delighted. If the audience is expecting to follow a more modern story that closely relates to The Odyssey, she will be disappointed since the film is very loosely based on Homer's classic poem. However, if the expectation is to just find a story about three escaped convicts searching for treasure, then she will see some of the connections to The Odyssey, but appreciate the turn of events as its own story, somewhat from The Odyssey's characters and plot line. The obvious liberty that the Coen brothers took with depicting Homer's Odyssey does not veer completely off base; instead they offer the basic nuts and bolts of some of its most epic characters and scenes. Cyclops makes an appearance as a smooth-talking Bible salesman, played by John Goodman, and the Siren scene, is sexy and mesmerizing, as it should be. Since the Coen brothers left some of the most ultimate parts of the Odyssey in the film, we are able to make the connection, but view each scene as its own separate contribution to the journey of Everett himself.Some of the most important characters from Homer's poem are missing, however, one of them especially, the character of Telemachus. Although we don't necessarily need his character to tell the whole story, his absence is felt by the necessary plot moving specifically towards Odysseus's journey, which is, in part, to get home to his son and wife, and helps to portray the time lost in Odysseus's absence. Without his presence in the movie, the audience may lose this detrimental part to the story. We are also missing the overall stakes. Throughout the film, the connection between Everett and his ultimate goal is lost. This could be because the focus on the possibility of losing his wife and daughters to another man (the suitors) is not very well established as the most important motive for Everett's escape from prison. The way Southerners are portrayed is also a bit problematic, in my opinion. Some of the characters are seen as being redneck hicks, dumb, and foolish. Although this portrayal is mostly done as a backwards humor, I think it is a mis-portrayal, since, the Coen brothers have admitted (per other film critiques) that they have never even been to Mississippi. That being said, I find it a little jarring that the South is chosen as a background to represent the foolishness and stupidity of some of The Odyssey's most famous players. I am biased, however, as I have lived in the south my entire life.I think ""O Brother where Art Thou?"" was an attempt by the Coen brothers to remain true to the story of Odysseus's journey, but not stick to it as a form of storytelling. I believe it is successful as its own story, not as it relates to The Odyssey, but as it stands alone by itself. In other words, the characters and the scenes can be considered something completely different than The Odyssey, as more of a journey to ""get the girl"" and find religion, since from the beginning, Everett argues with his cohorts about religious validity. And speaking of religion, the film seems to be using religion, or Everett's question of it, as a way to question the difference between right and wrong and the basic human struggle to stay on the right path, resist temptation. As Everett continues his quest to get home, he begins to ""suffer"" and asks God for mercy.I would compare this movie to a ""road trip"" film such as ""Smokey and The Bandit,"" a rendition of which is complete with southern sass and culture, bluegrass and country singing, and travelers who are constantly evading the law, without a heavy influence on the ultimate objective of the journey itself. ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" may not be lacking in humor and good ole southern religion, but its attempt to stay true to the Original Odyssey is, in effect, not going to make it home.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Just perfect,"I can't think of a more enjoyable film I've seen in the last 10 years or so. It's a feel good movie that does just that. Others have said it's a film that can be watched over and over.

I never read a thing about the movie before I saw it except it was a Coen Bros film. That's all I needed to know.

"o bill monroe, where art thou?","Until The Big Lebowski I did not know who the Coen brothers were. Fargo was interesting but blood is not that much of a turn on for me even if it is tongue and cheek. But when I saw Lebowski I thought it was the best movie I had ever seen. So I had to see everything that the Coen's did including Fargo again. Seeing Blood Simple for the first time and knowing who the Coens are and what they had to go through to get into the movie industry was an education in how talent can overcome political connections in the movie industry. I didn't think they could top The Big Lebowski so I didn't see O Brother, Where art thou? until now. In fact I have to admit that O brother now is the best movie ever made. In fact they don't even make movies they make works of art. I know that reviewers like Rodger Ebert are not that impressed but that's only because they have to take the movies seriously and not as just entertainment first.

Fine Cohens Modern Fairy Tale,"This is one of the rare examples where good story telling and good execution alone are enough without a strong morality at the end or guiding principle. This is ""just"" a well-told Cohens film, therefor special and setting itself apart from other productions of its time in the world of cinema; a modern fairy tale set in the early century deep south, with all sorts of crazy unlikely events, zany adventures, particular characters found along the way and along the miles traveled by the protagonists, miles of fun had by the viewers. This is cinema in its most gratuitous form - a simple experience of taking in the produce from the minds of film-making creators and enjoying it to the fullest, without any exercised effort to determine a particular goal within the plot or deeper meaning of the story.

in fine--if different--form again,"the most astonishing thing to me, as i read over the comments on this film, is the incredible range of opinion it has elicited.  people seem to react with polar opposite feelings about the same aspects of this movie, which is enough to make me wonder sometimes if we all saw the same one, but without dwelling on complex matters of interpretation, i'll just stick to the film.for whatever reason, i find myself drawn to films which drastically divide audiences in their reactions, and this one is no exception--i loved it and thought it was a nice comeback from the (to me) good-but-uneven ""The Big Lebowski.""  things that are pretty safe to assert about ""O Brother"":  1) it is the Coens' warmest, most sentimental film since ""The Hudsucker Proxy."" 2) it continues certain recurring themes/obsessions in the brothers' milieu, most particularly in that the plot revolves around crime (often rebelliously championing the ""little man"" against the power of big money) and that the film as a whole focuses very specifically on a particular time and place.  i have thought at times that the coens are doing a region-by-region survey of the greatness and lunacy of the united states, but maybe i am reading way too much into their work.be that as it may, here is what i loved about ""O Brother"" as i saw it: it did a beautiful job re-creating the look and feel of a certain era that is long gone and forever lost to us now--the depression.  there is much that is terribly romantic about the 30's (and never more so than here), in particular the fact that hobos and bank robbers and even convicts were not widely looked upon as dangerous elements of society but rather sympathized with, sometimes even admired and immortalized in song and story as folk heroes.  hard luck times then had the effect of making people depend upon each other and trust each other more, while reviling big money and banks. by setting this film in that time and place and by making the heroes escaped convicts, the coens are being at least gently subversive toward our current ""gilded age"" of vast wealth for the privileged few of the technocracy and bread and circuses for the rest of us.  any doubt about this fact is erased by the use of harry mcclintock's ""big rock candy mountain"" over the opening credits, arguably the quintessential outlaw folk anthem of the time. that being said, the film becomes a generous and hearty parable about the triumph of the flawed but noble common man over the devious, manipulative, and corrupt forces that seek to exploit and control him.  if that is not your cup of tea, then this film may be deeply unsatisfying to you.  for me, though, it was occasion to stand up and cheer.  viva la coens!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wonderful movie - deep and meaningful,"This movie really had it all - meaning, humor, great acting, wonderful writing. I was very impressed with the quality of the direction and the screenplay, both of which brought out a uniquely adapted ""Odyssey"". The film's cinematography captures the essence of the '30s, and, contrary to its slapstick front, makes some very important points about US history, social circles, and cultural heritage. O Brother, Where Art Thou is one of the 15 movies I own simply because of how effective I found it. Watching it reminds me of the first time I saw Gladiator and the way I questioned my world-view, seeing deeper meaning to the mundane things around me. In Gladiator, the mundane was represented by the feel of wheat shafts on one's palm vividly represented in Russell Crowe's dreams of his home; in this film, the simple landscape that forms each scene brings to mind how important it is to just stop and appreciate the little things.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

not one of their better efforts,"Ok - so I caught on to the loose parallels with the Odyssey. The sirens, John Goodman as the Cyclops, Holly Hunter as Penelope. Maybe I missed something, but the whole Odyssey thing seemed like forced cleverness.The movie came across as a collection of hollow stereotypes that managed to expose the Coen brothers' obvious contempt for the culture of the rural South. Because they are so out of touch with the people about whom they wrote, the lines often came out lifeless and flat. Particularly with Turtorro who was totally miscast as a hillbilly. He sounded like he picked up his Southern accent from watching episodes of Foghorn Leghorn. Also - I though hillbilly music literally came from the hills - Appalachia - not the Mississippi Delta.I would be interested to see the Coen brothers turn their vicious parody machine on a culture with which they have some familiarity - say Jewish culture. Could you imagine if a couple of Southern boys had made a film that brought to life all of the negative stereotypes associated with New York Jews -- perhaps set against the musical stylings of Gershwin's tin pan alley??The movie came across as slightly too mean-spirited.Not one of their better efforts, in my opinion.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

I love movies like these that have a very dark crude humor and it's hard to find historical movies like this one that have that kind of humor. This movie is unique and unlike any other which is why I think so many people like this movie. Overall this was a great movie and I would definitely watch it more than once!,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Coen Brothers: Cinematic Crackerjacks,"The only other Coen Brothers film I've seen is ""Fargo"", and I fully enjoyed that movie. When I saw commercials for ""O Brother"", I had NO CLUE what the movie was supposed to be about. But seeing that it was a Coen Brothers film, I decided it was worth a watch. I was extremely pleased, watching this film on an airplane, then on home video. This movie is an extremely fun fare; not serious in the slightest. If you want a realistic fun-filled journey, watch this film.",,Anonymous,Crime
Engaging but still a bit dry,"Recently I have been watching a lot of the Coen brothers' films, and consequently I saw this film. 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is loosely based upon the Odyssey by Homer, and that is what drew me in to begin with, not to mention the three brilliant actors as the protagonists (George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson). All three are talented and really portrayed the characters (Everett, Pete and Delmar respectively) in a fun way that I don't believe any other actors could have done. With all this praise, it may seem like my rating of 6 is unjustified, so let me break it down in the paragraphs below.Firstly, although the plot was based on the Odyssey, they only loosely followed it, with certain plot points (some being quite important) from the original tale being omitted. For example, John Goodman's character represented the cyclops in the story, yet in the sequence where he appeared his part was completely different from that of the cyclops in the Odyssey. I'm not going to spoil anything here, but hopefully those who have seen the movie will recall what I'm talking about, and those who haven't yet will eventually see it.Next, I want to mention that I didn't laugh or chuckle at all throughout the entire film. I just didn't seem to find much funny. You might say that I just didn't get some of the humor, but the truth is I did. It was just a bit dry for me. I understand that some other people may disagree with me, and they might think this film was incredibly hilarious. That's fine. I'm just saying that in my opinion, the film was a bit dry.Finally, I didn't care for the part from where Everett (Clooney) arrived in town with Delmar (Nelson) until the wedding sequence. I don't know why. I wasn't offended or anything, but this part of the film did not capture my interest.Overall, looking at the film from an objective perspective, the film is well-shot, has an interesting inspiration, has three great actors as leads, and portrays America during the Depression in a unique way, with figures from the era appearing in the film (Baby Face Nelson, for one). From a subjective standpoint though, the film is a little dry and has segments that didn't interest me. When going into a comedy film, I expect to at least let out a chuckle, but really, the film didn't do that. Still, I do appreciate it when viewing it objectively, so it gets more than a 5 (which is 50%, which in turn should represent a standardized pass). Still my subjective side deters me from giving it more than a 6. Even though I didn't love this film doesn't mean it isn't worth watching. If you get the chance to see this, please do so. You might enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Coens' best film ever.,"Having gone through a horrid dry spell for good movies recently, which hit rock bottom when I found myself, out of desperation, watching Vertical Limit, the Coen Brothers have come through once again, and have they ever.Let me start by stating that I'm biased - about 4 months ago I fell in with a few fellows playing old time music, so it's been on my mind lately. And what made this movie for me was definitely the music: The obvious hit is the Soggy Bottom Boys doing I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow, but the high points for me were the baptists singing Down to the River to Pray, The Siren Song, and Ralph Stanley providing the voice for O Death. The presence of Jerry Douglas on dobro in a few scenes ain't too shabby neither. For a fan of old time/mountain music, this movie is like a shot of heroin - you will be back again and again.But even without the music, the movie features that Coen Bros touch, a little bit odd without descending into overt weirdness, and somehow true to life - there were some truly hilarious moments, and moments of such beauty that I was shaken.I have only one complaint that I can make about this movie, and it's a petty one: during some of the musical numbers, you could clearly hear instruments being played that weren't being ""lipsynced"" onscreen, and sometimes the lipsyncing was a bit off. However, that didn't bother me enough to keep me from giving this flick a well-deserved 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Lackluster,"O Brother, Where Art Thou? 6.5/10I didn't laugh out loud once. The Coen brothers should've went back to the drawing board on this one. Or, perhaps, they should have actually READ Homer's Odyssey rather than Cliff Notes, or not relied on it at all. The whole acknowledgement to Homer is just insulting.The characters were simply too weird even for a Coen brothers film. How many blind men were there? Three or four? While I admit that Clooney had the best dialogue, he was simply too handsome--or out of place--for this film. I wanted to laugh whenever he went into one of those pseudo-intellectual riffs, but I couldn't. Something was wrong about them. (The film tried to explain it away later--Everett went up for practicing law w/o a license--but I wasn't convinced. That was just way too convenient storywise.)The only genuine thing I saw in all of O Brother was the Klan scene. When it came, I couldn't believe it. I was right at the edge of thunderous laughter, but after 2/3rds of squat, just I couldn't do it. I did, however, rewind the scene. It's probably the only thing I'll remember about the film. I'm not counting the backward trio's engaging song ""I'm a Man in Sorrow"", though. While I certainly liked it, it was an obvious plot device at its introduction.Everything felt haphazard, truncated, predictable. I just couldn't get into it, which is unusual, because I'm a Coen Brother's fan. So, I don't think it was me. They (the Coen Brothers) were simply off the mark this time. Go see Blood Simple or Fargo instead.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Okay, this is epic!","The Coen brothers adaptation of Homer's Odyssey is a masterpiece, and I love how creatively they adapt the story to Great Depression Era America. It is genuinely one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. The casting is great, Of course George Clooney stands out, he plays Ulysses Everett fantastically. It's a perfect dark comedy, with a good bit of drama too. I recommend this movie to literally anyone, it's that good. It's wonderfully weird and a great watch.My only real complaint is that the story is structured a bit strangely, and it can be, at moments, hard to follow. Besides that it's JUST SO GOOD! Pure kino.

"Enjoyable 30's nostalgic ride, with characters you care about","This movie is based on the classic story of Homer's 'Odyssey' set in the 30's in Mississippi.  3 convicts escape on a quest, and the adventure takes them throughout rural Mississippi in classic scenery and memorable characters.  I am not familiar with the Odyssey story at all, but I really enjoyed this nostalgic romp.Clooney is great in this role as Ulysses Everett McGill, a wise cracking, brylcreme addicted personality, who goes on about the state of his affairs with a huge smile and a rambling southern accent.  It was a real treat to watch him in this role.  The cinematography is also quite good, and it had that great 30's nostalgic feel and captured the era perfectly.  I am a big sucker for nostalgia in movies and this film handled it perfectly.  And Turturro is great as always, he's definitely another favourite actor of mine.I suppose being familiar with the original story I would have gotten more out of it, but still it was a fun ride.  It is not perfection, but it is a refreshing change from the same old same old, by placing a spin on a classic story in an interesting setting.Rating 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The soundtrack is the star of the show,"Depression era American South is given the Odyssey treatment in this crafty, beautifully shot and at times enjoyable fable from the Coen brothers. The film looks to have been a lot more fun shooting than it is watching. It's got an unmistakable meta-level quality to it that makes it almost impossible to get immersed in - except strictly intellectually. It's a film which appeals more to your senses than your sensibilities. The story plays out as constructed as you'd expect from a reinterpretation of Homer's ""The Odyssey"", but there are abundances of fine observations of bygone customs and mannerism which in particular will please those who remember them. The star of the show, however, is the soundtrack, which consists mainly of bluegrass and folk music from the relevant era, produced by T-Bone Burnett, most notably the unlikely hit ""Man of Constant Sorrow"".",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The sirens are there as 3 woman singing sexually. They were also evil just like the sirens. Even the cyclops is there by how he looks and behaves. The cyclops was so intresting to me since he was not quite the same. He had vioalnce tendecies and ruthless behavior which represented the cyclops the most. A person who would read the Odyssey would love the representation of it visually. Their surviving journey is similar to how Odysseus was surviving all along.

I'm just looking for my brother,"The movie ''O, Brother Where Art Thou?'' directed by the Coen brothers is a real-life Odyssey. They adapted the story into a movie and of course, it has parallels in it. I liked the movie, but it was a little bit complicated for me because you need to look for similarities between the Odyssey and the movie. The adaptation could be clearer. When I started to watch, I thought that is boring but after 30 minutes, I started to see Odyssey features then the movie became an adventure for me. I think it could be better because it seems like they scattered Odyssey to the film like pieces of a puzzle. You have to watch carefully and collect these puzzle pieces to see the Odyssey. Also, I like the Delmar and Pete character so much. They represent the pureness, and foolishness of the Odysseus crew super well. In anyways this movie was enjoyable.

Brilliant adaptation of Homer's epic poem the Odyssey!,"Another thoroughly enjoyable Coen offering. The Coen's have become, as an Italian might put it ""master del loro mestiere"" (Master's of their craft). In the Coen adaptation of Homer's epic, Clooney's character, Ulysuss Evert McGee, faces the same obstacles as Homer's hero Odysseus encountered in an effort to return to his wife and children (Evert's goal as well)! The cyclops, the prophet, the sirens, captivity, suitors for his wife's affections, Charybdis (more or less all the parallels are there) and are all interwoven in this compelling, amusing, and must see film! Kudos to the Coen's and their cast! By the way the music ain't bad either! You won't regret spending roughly 110 minutes of your life I predict 'enjoying' this film!

Depression Era South Nightmare,"Althoug many details are extremely far fetched, this story of rural Mississippi ca. 1935 has many realistic elements reminding of the ""dark side"" of life ""down South"" in the years prior to WWII. George Clooney is convincing as the street-wise and ""worldly"" self-appointed leader of a 3-man team escaping from a chain gang. The trio encounter a series of situations, including a recording-session at a make-shift studio owned by a blind radio station DJ, encounters with a bank robber, a shifty crook posing as Bible salesman, and several near-lynchings. Inbetween scenes we see a rivalry between the incumbent Governor and his radical challenger.Several scenes are powerful testimony to the social injustices of the day. A secret nightly KKK rally is awe-inspiring. To see how an innocent man was to be ""offered up"" due to nothing other than his skin color is a shocking thing to view. Another vivid reminder of ""how things used to be"" is the sadistic prison official, who has a keen interest in ""law enforcement"" (namely lynchings).Several critical moments turned out OK for our heroes, right down to the ""act of God"" towards the end, which gave a satisfying conclusion to the story. I appreciated the many historically correct details, yet the entire story was quite unlikely (as in ""The Green Mile""). It's like getting struck by lightning AND winning the State Lottery both on the same day (and living to enjoy the fortune!).",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not your typical movie,"I wasn't sure what to expect from ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Homer's Odyssey set in the deep South during the Great Depression? A premise like that screams ""arty film,"" and an ""arty film"" usually equates to ""bad film."" Look no further than ""The Avengers"" to see a what I mean. On the other hand, it was the product of the Coen brothers, and I was quite entertained by ""The Hudsucker Proxy,"" so I thought I might like it. And if anyone can pull off an ""arty film,"" it's the Coen brothers.The story revolves around chiefly around three men who escape from a chain gang and rush to collect a hidden treasure before the place where it is hidden is flooded by a dam project. Along the way, they have a variety of interesting and amusing experiences.George Clooney plays the head convict, Ulysses Everett McGill, a man obsessed with having perfectly slicked-back hair (with nothing less than ""Dapper Dan"" hair gel), to the point of wearing a hair net while sleeping. He is accompanied by the rather dull (mentally) Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro) and the even duller Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson). Their on-screen exploits are, to say the least, hilarious.One of the funniest parts is how Ulysses, as described in one review, ""manages to pull ten dollar words from a five-cent brain."" My favorite scene was when the three cons, still chained together, attempt to hop a moving train. Ulysses hops on and faces a group of hobos. As the second convict climbs aboard, Ulysses says, ""Any of you boys smithies? Or, if not smithies per se, were you otherwise trained in the metallurgic arts before straitened circumstances forced you into a life of aimless wanderin'?"" During this, the last con trips and falls while trying to board the train, dragging the other two off with him.The cinematography is, as usual, gorgeous, and the music compliments the story and location nicely. Particularly good was the number performed by the three convicts in the story to earn some extra money.The storyline does wander somewhat, but, considering the topic, it's actually rather appropriate!

Superbly Entertaining,"This is absolutely one of the most fun and entertaining films I have ever seen, easily ranking up there with the Adventures of Baron Munchausen.Somewhat like Terry Gilliam and his cohorts, the Coen brothers have a knack for creating a wacky story with colorful, odd-ball characters and odd events in a surreal manner that is utterly compelling and convincing. They achieved all of that in this film, providing a surreal and very fun take on a stereotypical movie-land version of the South combined with many ideas and characters certainly based on the Odyssey and Aeneid. Although they supposedly claimed never to have ""read"" the Odyssey, and some have criticized this film as incorrectly claiming to be inspired by the Odyssey, it is quite clear that that inspiration is there. Numerous characters and events are clearly taken from the myths of Odysseus (and, in fact, Aeneas), but they are simply dressed up in a wacky Southern guise. The events may not happen ""exactly"" as they did in the Odyssey, etc., but that is irrelevant. The fact remains that the parallels are undeniably there and that everything in the film works beautifully.The cinematography, visuals in general, soundtrack, and the acting are all excellent. The result is, in my book, certainly one of the Coen brothers' best achievements, although not quite the equal of The Hudsucker Proxy, which is simply incredible. It is possibly their most fun move ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Musical ecstasy.,"This film is incredibly well cast, I can't praise the actors enough... The three main protagonists are extremely amiable. The likes of John Goodman, who I've never been a particular fan of to date also deserves praise for his part, as do almost all of the cast list. By the end, you'll truly find yourself attached to the protagonists, and you'll be invested in their well-being. Indeed, the cast plays an imperative role in this production,but they aren't the only aspect that requires praise.The whole concept of the plot being centered around Greek mythology is genius, and works astonishingly well. The whole production is very original, honestly there are few films like this one.But of course, the best aspect of the whole film is by far the musical contribution. Picking a favorite song is hard, every single one is naturally catchy. Truthfully, even if the casting was below par and the Greek mythological dimension was absent from the film, the music alone could probably carry it in my opinion. Indeed, from the very opening scene the musical dimension is ever-present and never fails to deliver on the next hit. I'm surprised to see myself write that, as someone who has never been a fan of musicals.Give this one a watch for sure, I haven't heard a bad word about it to date and I can't imagine I ever will.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Dapper Dan,"It is always difficult to see what the Coen brothers will come up with next. Always shrouded in secrecy, the public have no choice but to be surprised by their next project. In this case, O Brother Where Art Thou does not fall short.In their latest project, the Coen brothers have given the film the same kind of dreamy atmosphere that was hinted at in the wonderful The Big Lebowski. The washed out but warm colours give a very hazy feel to it all, providing a loving background to the humourous situations our 3 escaped convicts find themselves in.The performances of our 3 main characters steal the show - so much so in fact that the film tends to suffer when they are not on screen, although thankfully these moments are both short and rare.Praise must also be given for the fantastic soundtrack. I must admit I am not a big fan of country music, but the songs in the film did raise more than a smile from me.If you liked the Coen brothers' previous work, or more specifically if you loved The Big Lebowski, then you will love this. However I can see that for just as many of those who will love this film, there will be those who hate it.

Amusing rural Mississippi odyssey in the 30s,"During the Depression, three guys escape a chain gang in Mississippi (George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro) to experience many misadventures with a blind prophet, a gifted musician (Chris Thomas King), a radio station, baby-face Nelson (Michael Badalucco), baptism in a river, ""sirens,"" a one-eyed Bible salesmen (John Goodman), an ex-wife (Holly Hunter), the KKK, corrupt politicians and an area with hidden treasure about to be flooded.A Coen brothers film, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""

It's quirky and amusing augmented by its setting and locations, not to mention one of my wife's favorite movies (possibly because Clooney was in his prime). In ways, it's like ""Deliverance"" (1972) if it were a comedy, just mixed with ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967) and a dash of Homer's Odyssey.I like it, but don't love it; it's fun, no doubt, but also kinda forgettable.

Attractive and entertaining,"Though the story is not all that special - we have seen numerous stories of convicts on the run - this film is ultimately attractive for a number of different reasons. The interpretations displayed by the three run-aways is always acceptable or better, the photography is excellent, and a few songs from country' and negro spirituals add fine-tasting ingredients to the proceedings. Together with some handsome cars from the 1930's, the whole is an entertaining result - as long as you are not looking for anything too deep, philosophical or otherwise intellectual. Thus religious references - including the Ku Klux Klan - should not be taken seriously. Indeed, that is part of the point the Coen brothers - Jewish in origin - wanted to make: being neutral or non-believer often allows you to open your eyes to other points of view and not be critical of those who profess other religions. Which is perhaps the best religion of all .............I cannot think of any other film at this moment in which George Clooney as Ulysses communicated to me better than in this film ......... or even John Turturro, come to think of it. The three escaped convicts played really likeable characters, which overode any shallowness the story-line might have had. Whether the original Odyssey by Homer really has much to do with this film is up to you: obviously it is with no disrespect nor by fortuitous accident, that the rotund politician went by the name of Homer, as well as the evident connection with the use of Ulysses. However, all that Mississippi countryside was filmed lovingly, with exquisite care playing with the sunlight.I certainly found this film more attractively entertaining than the other famous film by the Coen brothers, `The big Lebowsky', and is worth the high side of 6½ on my scale.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

And the eyes don't have all the fun: the soundtrack is even better, with ""The Man of Constant Sorrow"" only one of a dozen excellent tracks.But in terms of writing, directing, and acting, O Brother is a disappointment.  Structured loosely around Homer's Odyssey, the tone remains cynical and detached.  Clooney, awarded a Golden Globe for his starring role, should be applauded for trying something different, but his performance seems like it was pulled from an extended bit part.  His two dim buddies, likewise underdeveloped and played as two-dimensional buffoons, embody the sneering jests the Coen brothers make about Southern culture.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Coen brothers have used many actors from their usual team (Johns Goodman/Tuturro etc.) and have mixed them up with a varied bag of others to produce a very fine character driven cast. The action rarely dwindles and there are some fine set pieces to remember, many of which are punctuated by the type of visual gags that are seldom witnessed outside of a Zucker/Abrahams film. The storyline is apparently based on Homer's odyssey, but as both brothers have admitted to never having read it the plot is not constrained to any level of accuracy, and their splendid imaginations are able to run rampant. This film is a visual and comic treat, more focused that the Big Liebowski, funnier than Fargo, and as those are the only other Coen brothers films I can remember now I will end my comparisons there.

However, the treasure turns out to be bogus and the three men end up discovering hidden musical talents which win them a repreive. The three men go on a journey which allows the spectator to view the idiosyncracies of life through the eyes of three idiots, covering everything from politics through racism to love.A dramatisation of Homers 'Odysey,' O'Brother renders a time and space with such poignancy that you feel as if you are viewing the film through the same sandy gauze as all that romantic frontier photography.

Journey Through A Bad Dream,"Three not-so-smart convicts escape a chain gang in Depression-era Mississippi and in three stooges fashion, go from one disaster to another. The semi-humorous plot is like a bad dream that goes on and on, each segment brief and with little or no continuity to the segment that went before. Along the way our stooges encounter interesting, oddball characters, most of whom represent some stereotyped persona from that era in American history. Probably the most interesting of these characters is ""Radio Station Man"", a blind one man outfit that records and plays corny songs to a local hick audience.Given the surreal storyline, lack of scene continuity is not a problem. But some segments and some characters seem like unnecessary filler. Character exaggeration works well for some characters, but not others. Toward the end the plot gets a little silly and the climax seems tacked on.Except for the wide ratio, letterbox screen format, color cinematography is terrific. The brownish yellow sepia toned images, which exist throughout, convey an appropriately dry and old look, consistent with the story's bygone era. Overall mise-en-scene design adds emotional support to that visual feel.I could have wished for less screen time for George Clooney, whose character dominates the plot. Aside from that, casting and acting are acceptable. Possibly the best element is that harmonic music, a down home type that generally has gone out of style, though it remains popular among mostly rural Americans.A splashy, big budget, in-your-face satire of some elements in American history, ""O Brother ..."" holds your attention as we journey dream-like through a world of three guys whose collective IQ may be limited but whose capacity to find trouble is not.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The ODDyssey of Humour,"This is perhaps the strangest version of Homer's Odyssey I have ever seen. Set in the rural south of the 1930's, George Clooney plays the character who is just trying to get back home to his wife and daughters (The Wharvey Gals and Penny Wharvey, played by the three cutest kids I've ever seen on film and Holly Hunter,) who are about to be whisked away by their ""new daddy"". The odyssey is very loosely referred to throughout the film. John Goodman plays the ""cyclops"" (a one-eyed Bible salesman who mugs our hero and his friend,) the incredibly beautiful and erotic ""sirens"" are three luscious women washing clothes and singing by the stream, and there's even some divine intervention.  Through it all, George Clooney searches for ""hair pomade"",  manages to inadvertently cut a hit record, and finds himself in more ""tight spots"" than Wile E.

Paterfamilias,"This film is a spectacle of sorts.  Y'see there's these three soggy sonsubitches by the names of Everett (Clooney) Pete (Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), who escape from a chain gang and embark on a journey acrost the state of Mississippi in the depression era 1930s.  Loosely following Homer's Odyssey, they jump from one frying pan into the next fire, and over again.  They get lost, get saved (a marvelous baptism scene) and manage to squeeze themselves into the strangest musical renditions and dance sequences imaginable.  Clooney gives a classic performance as a character I can best describe as the humanized version of Foghorn Leghorn: a know-it-all who loves to hear himself speak.  Then there's Pete played by John Turturro who's a grumpy guy along for the ride.  At the bottom of this food chain gang is Delmar played by Tim Blake Nelson.  Ole Delmar is a simple fellow with a good heart who's trying to keep a clean spirit in leu of the events these characters become involved in.  Woven into this deep South motif are a black blues singer who sold his soul to the devil, two shady candidates for the guvna's office, and a one eyed Bible salesman played by John Goodman. There's so many things to notice in this film.  There's a looney tunes quality, but also a very realistic quality, portraying the Depression era politics and poverty to a T.  There's also a three stooges quality, and the at the same time a very Preston Sturgess humanist thing.  It's the perfect balance for me but quite possibly the coolest thing about this film is the music, topping off that old timey look the film has.  It's awesome bluegrass, delta blues, and gospel music and it's a character of it's own in the film.  Long live the Coens and O Brother, I will be in line to see this again.",,Anonymous,Crime
Welcome back John Turturro,"Inspired by ""The Odyssey"", three escaped convicts from the South in the 1930's set out to find hidden treasure, a rumor told to them by an old man.I was very entertained by this film. It has a realistic depiction with a touch of fantasy to it, one that will really skew into some goofy scenes. It's a film that plays with your suspension of disbelief for a little, but stays focused nonetheless. The cast was well picked out, with George Clooney and John Turturro as the lead, as well as Tim Blake Nelson, all of which do an amazing job. The tone is one of the best parts of the movie. It should be a drama, given the source material and the setting, but it plays off as a light comedy, with several over the top scenes that set up for an excellent music score. The songs in this had me humming for days, T Bone Burnett really did a good job in capturing the tone and time period for the film, and it pays off.The film at times feels a little clustered, with some big stars that don't get as much screen time. Holly Hunter is pretty top billed, but isn't around until three fourths of the movie. The film is adapting itself into The Odyssey, so there are some appropriately added scenes that are there to be symbolism, and even though it's well done, it kind of slows down the adventurous pace. With that, the fantasy element of this film is strong, I feel like anything can happen in this movie, and that anything is possible, a free feeling I don't get in movies very often.Not one of my favorite Coen's, but entertaining nonetheless, with some great characters, interesting storytelling, and a fun tone and excellent music.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Funny, but don't expect it to be typical","The Coen Brothers are weird.If you take this as a known going into the movie, it will certainly help you know what to expect. That is, expect the unexpected.O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a tale about three escaped convicts who are racing against time to get to a treasure. On the way, they encounter all sorts of colourful characters and do all sorts of interesting things. It is loosely based on The Odyssey, but since I've never actually read The Odyssey it would be difficult for me to draw parallels.Parodies of everyone from Robert Johnson to the Carter Family show up at some point. There are hillbilly rednecks, a political election, a blind prophet, religious fanatics, some hooded KKK members, and a bunch of pyromaniacs with a penchant for killing.Somehow in this hodgepodge, a plot (and I use the term loosely) gets strung together. However, this movie isn't about the plot, nor is it about the acting, even despite George Clooney's golden globe award. Each time his accent slipped I questioned how well he deserved that one. But none of that was the point. The bottom line is, this movie is very, very funny.Of course, being able to pick out some of the references helps. I admit that I probably missed most of them, since many were very obscure, but there was still enough humour in there to entertain almost anyone.Just don't go into the movie expecting something typical, because O Brother, Where Art Thou? is anything but.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"'O Brother' Is Enjoyable, Entertaining & Quirky","The Coen brothers have created another enjoyable film.  While O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is definitely not their greatest work, it is certainly enjoyable, and is likely better than 70% of the movies being released today.Loosely based on Homer's epic poem, The Odyssey', O Brother' is the story of three inmates who've escaped from a 1920's prison chain gang in Mississippi.  They're running from the law and soon meet up with several adventures as they try to regain a million stolen dollars hidden nearby.Despite O, Brother's' origins in the classics, the movie is actually rather shallow.  There's not a lot of character development, and the plot, while entertaining, is somewhat thin.  O, Brother' did not set out to change the world or to tackle any important social issues.  But what seems to make this movie enjoyable is a fun script combined with good old-fashioned movie making--along with a variation of non-standard filmmaking techniques.  The Coens use music, and lots of it, to help move the movie along.  I was surprised to hear full versions of well-done folk and gospel songs.  The soundtrack for this movie is wonderful, and worth a separate purchase if you like folk or acoustic music.  Additionally, the movie's cinematography is effective.  Hues of yellow and brown fill many of the scenes, and it is fitting.  The colors and scenery effectively place us in a dusty 1920's Mississippi setting.  The Coens also cleverly vary the pace of the film. Slow deliberate moments are followed by well-paced action sequences.  It has the effect of luring you into a scene, and then cranking things up again with a new adventure.  Some may think that scenes are ill placed or do not fit well with the rest of the film.  But to me, this is the movie's strength. . . a quirkiness.  (This is not standard Hollywood fare.)The acting was fine.  I wouldn't expect any awards here due to the fact that the characters were not written with any real depth.  But both Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are hilarious as sidekicks to George Clooney. Their characters and accents couldn't be goofier.O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is not a great movie.  But it has enough fun, and enough innovation, to entertain and impress.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fantastic movie,"It takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it. O Brother does that and then some. The first time I saw it, I have to admit I had never seen anything like it. Then I wanted to see it again, and now I'm up to double digits with this great movie, the Coen brothers' finest movie they've ever done, with Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy coming in a tight second and third for me.George Clooney gives the performance of his career playing Ulysses Everett McGee, a fast-talking know-it-all escaped convict who really doesn't know that much at all. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are the perfect sidekicks for Clooney, particularly Nelson and his portrayal of Delmar, a loyal albeit uneducated fellow escapee. John Goodman is my favorite bit character as Big Dan, perfect. It reminds me of his part in Raising Arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. Coen brothers' favorites Holly Hunter and Charles Durning also provide memorable performances.Joel and Ethan Coen are masters of their trade. It's not like they try to win Academy Awards every time they make a film, they just try and tell a story that they want to tell, and it's entertaining. It's a loose adaptation of the Odyssey, and I mean loose for all of you Homer fanatics. It's just great.The most amazing part of this movie though is the coloring. I've watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and I am still in awe just thinking about it. The coloring does become an important part of the movie. Great great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Baffling collection of disjointed inane vignettes,"Perhaps the fact that this film has received such high ratings (in the IMDB) from so many reviewers is more a statement about their short attention span than it is about any (alleged) cinematic value of the film.I watched the film with a small group of friends, so I felt compelled to sit through the entire thing. Otherwise, I would have left. And while I have certainly turned off a few VHS / DVD films at home, I have never walked out of a cinema in the middle of a movie. (And that includes 'The Flintstones' film!) I can find absolutely nothing redeeming about this film.While the film does boast a nice array of well-known actors, none of them can do anything in this film to save it because the script is so damned awful. As another reviewer put it, it should be called ""Oh Cohesion, Where Art Thou?"" It is just a string of isolated vignettes that do not add up to any kind of unified plot. The only constant is the inanity.And while I have liked Clooney in a few things, his performances can rarely be described as multi-layered or nuanced. He tends toward the wooden, in my opinion, and here he is both wooden and flat.Of course, different strokes for different folks. So if you like it, then vive la différence!

"Jon Monsarrat review:  Accessible to non-arty types, best of Coen brothers","I'm an action movie buff and typically don't take a hankerin' to arty films. I just don't have the sophistication or film school training to appreciate the cinematography or makeup or score if the plot is bad.But I was really dazzled by ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"", which comes with a big dose of arty, but it's not overwhelming. Rather, it's accessible, with a fast, intellectual plot, lots of comedy, and lots of wonderful bluegrass music.What a wonderfully original film. And unlike many musicals, where the characters just say, ""Oh, I think I'll break into song now,"" there are real plot reasons for the singing to occur everywhere. If you are familiar with Homer's ""The Odyssey"", there are some in-jokes as well. There are a number of wonderfully clever plot gimmicks, too such as the ending.My only concern would be that bluegrass music is sometimes so religious it's overkill... but that's just the culture and the music is great.

O Brother Where Art Thou is a very enjoyable modern(ish) twist. Being set in the great depression you can make a comparison of america to ithaca after the war.

Anyone notice Clooney played Clark Gable?,"Just saw the film last night, and was struck by how much George Clooney seemed to be playing his character as Clark Gable would have. So much, from the mustache to the cadence and tone of his speech, had Gable all over it. Watch ""It Happened One Night"" and you will see what has to have been Clooney's inspiration.Having seen Clooney in so many other roles, and never like this, means this had to be an intentional impersonation. It actually fits with the story -- many a fellow in 1937 would no doubt, from pomade to manner of speaking, have liked to emulate Gable, the consummate leading man of the day.I have searched through many reviews and comments on this film and have been surprised not to see this mentioned.",,Anonymous,Crime

One of the Coen's Brothers Very Best!!,"I must say at the outset that I am a TOTAL Coen Brothers fan and have seen ALL of their projects. This ranks right up there as one of their crowning achievements.This is a re-telling of the ""Odyssey"" by Homer and after viewing this, I finally got a handle on just what the ""Odyssey"" was about. In a nutshell, it follows the exploits of a man and the exotic characters he meets along his journey. The way the Coen Brothers personified such stalwart literary characters as the Cyclops (John Goodman) and the Furies is most creative.Excellent performances all around from the likes of George Clooney (in one of his most endearing roles), the incomparable John Goodman, Holly Hunter, John Turturo, Charles Durning and a wonderfully strong supporting cast.However, one cannot mention the merits of this movie without a mention of the soundtrack. It is most obvious that the Coen Brothers invested an enormous amount of research to make sure that the music adequately accompanied the mood and tone. A wonderfully indelible example is the use of an acapella song (that utilizes no words, only moans) still used in African-American churches that is beautifully realized.The music in this project is positively spellbinding, regardless of your particular musical preferences - there is something here for everybody.

Here is my niece Ethel and her story.We lived through the depression and related to some of the conditions portrayed. We have watched it perhaps a dozen times. Each time we see it we pick up on something we had missed because we were still laughing at, or discussing, an earlier scene or line. The entire film was a collection of photographically great faces. We are still asking ourselves whether the entire cast were professionals or whether some were individuals found on location. The film was rich with subtle tie-ins like the children tied together with twine, as the prisoners were connected by chains. We still think the cow may have been hit unintentionally. Fords of that era had mechanical brakes. The driver of the car may not have been accustomed the longer stopping distances required. The many allusions to Ulysses Odyssey inspired us to do an inter-net search. We found a modern text version and discovered more sly references. We appreciate blue grass and country music as originally American and found it thoroughly enjoyable, along with the authentic ""Go To Sleep Little Baby"" and ""Down from the Mountain."" We were emotionally touched by this film because of our age, and find it totally entertaining every time we view it. We are still amazed that someone not of our generation could have captured the essence of that period of United States history.My niece is mentally unstable and you should not take her seriously.

A bona fide Classic and a sensory experience all its own,"The Coen Brother's O Brother Where Art Thou is just a rush of pure originality, musical genius and inspired storytelling, situated outside the box of used conventions, and rooted deeply in a whimsical realm of absurd, charming characters on an epic odyssey across the American south during arguably the most eccentric time period, the 1930s Great Depression. It's the Coen's second best for me (it's hard to top the Lebowski, dude), and a film that I watched so many time growing up that it's almost now a piece of my soul. It's loosely based on Homer's The Odyssey. Three bumbling convicts escape from a dusty chain gang in a delightful opening romp set to Harry McClintock's The Big Rock Candy Mountain. Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) is their silver tongued, trouble making leader, on his way to reunite with his estranged wife (Holly Hunter, reliably stubborn and sassy) and little daughters. Along with him is short tempered Pete (Coen regular John Turturro in top form) and sweet, dimwitted Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). Together they get in just about every kind of trouble that you can imagine three hapless convicts on the run in depression era south getting into. They briefly share paths with musician Tommy (Chris Thomas King), cross the radar of a boisterous bible salesman (John Goodman, stealing scenes as usual with his effortless, booming charm), become involved with duelling governor candidates Homer Stokes and Pappy O Daniels (Wayne Duvall and Charles Durning), and have run ins with sexy sirens led by Musetta Vander, the KKK, notorious mobster George Babyface Nelson (Michael Badalucco has to be seen to be believed as the lively, likely bi polar suffering wise guy) and more, all the while pursued by mysterious Sheriff Cooley (Daniel Von Bargen, RIP). It's quite al lot of goings on for one film, but the Coens are masters of telling zany, eclectic stories that deviate into all sorts of unexpected subplots without ever derailing and losing us. This one flows along wondrously, a wild, funny and haunting fable that almost feels like a dust bowl Dante's Inferno at times, albeit of much lighter subject matter. Roger Deakins spins poetry with his lens, capturing every chaff of wheat, every ray of southern sun and brown hued set design with painstaking expertise. What really holds it together though, is the absolute knockout soundtrack. There's so many moments of now iconic musical storytelling that we feel we're watching a strange bluegrass lullaby that just happens to take place in cinematic vision. The Coens have always known their music, but they transcend to another level of intuition here, gathering an incredibly evocative group of songs and artists together that stir the collective ancestral memory of historical Americana. Off the top of my head there's You Are My Sunshine, Keep On The Sunny Side, I'll Fly Away beautifully warbled by the Kossoy Sisters, Didn't Leave Nobody But The Babe sung by the slinky sirens, In The Highways by the adorable Peasall sisters, Jimmie Rodgers's In The Jailhouse Now, Lonesome Valley, Ralph Stanley's two eerie pieces O Death, and Angel Band, also by the Peasall Gals, and the classic Down To The River To Pray, which sneaks up on you and leaves you in rapture from its inescapable grip. My favourite by far though is I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow, an endlessly catchy hobo tune of jangling melancholy and highway humour, sung by John Hartford but cheekily lip synced by Clooney and team, an original piece made up on the fly by the three characters that goes on to make them ridiculously famous under the pseudonym the 'Soggy Bottom Boys'. It's all an intoxicating wonder to take in, the period authentic screenplay and production a feast for the senses. The Coens seem to be adept at whatever they try; sly satire, period piece, stinging violence, dark humour, and even touching drama when they put their minds to it. This is a career high for them, a totally unique piece of art that demands multiple viewings and a spot in any avid movie collectors pantheon.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

On my Top Ten,OK. I completely love the Coen Brothers. They can do no wrong. They are the scoundrel analysts of the human soul. The world is not to be taken too seriously and they know it. And they can persuade actors to be as great as they can be. But they don't make funny ha-ha movies. You will cry as much as you laugh. From the deep empathy they show to every creation. And all of this this happens in Oh Brother. George Clooney who already has that glint in his eye that a leading man needs is now granted humility and desperation. Which his jail suit complements perfectly. Are there not at least ten 'characters' in this movie you will never forget? People you will see on the streets from now onwards.

delightful!,"This movie is wonderful for anyone who's looking for something fun and whimsical.  Check it out if you enjoyed movies like ""Raising Arizona"" or (of course) ""Fargo"" or if you enjoyed the TV series ""Northern Exposure"".  The genius here is in pairing slightly warped, very clever and sharply defined characters with the thick cultural essence and stereotypes of depression era Mississippi.Another reason 'O Brother' is so great is that one really begins to root for the success of the characters. White-trash never looked so good! These characters capture you. George Clooney further strips himself of his pretty-boy image as he fantasticaly becomes the smooth talking trickster and allows himself to be the very lucky fool.  Tim Blake Nelson (as Delmar) is a gentle and innocent addition allowing us to not only find this bunch interesting, but endearing as well.

Only the Coen brothers could create something so magical AND wacky,"Most people would probably never imagine transposing ""The Odyssey"" to 1930's Mississippi, but the Coen brothers pulled it off perfectly.

"One of the Best, No Question","In the deep south during the 1930s, three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while a relentless lawman pursues them.Saying this is the Coen Brothers' greatest film would be hard, as so many of their movies are among the greatest made in the last few decades. Does this surpass ""Fargo"" or ""The Big Lebowski""? Some would say yes, but how do you decide that? ""Lebowski"" is one of the biggest cult films of its generation.What is great about this film is... well, everything. Solid acting, beautiful cinematography (particularly the sepia tones) and a great adaptation of the work of Homer. Classic literature does not always come across as fresh to modern generations. In this incarnation, it certainly does. A special nod must go to Tim Blake Nelson.

George Clooney's only truly memorable film and a definite masterpiece,"Let's get one thing straight-- I despise the classics. I groaned through ""Romeo & Juliet"" *both* times I had to read it for school. I thought ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was ridiculous. And I absolutely loathed ""The Odyssey"" (which I also had to read twice). Fortunately, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" successfully updates the story and makes it accessible, enjoyable, and an absolute delight.George Clooney is Odysseus (actually, that's Ulysses Everett McGill), trying to get back to his wife Penny (Holly Hunter), who's told their children he got run over by a train. Instead of war, he's been working on a chain gang, and instead of some kind of vengeful force, he now has to elude a sinister Sheriff (and a cyclops bible salesman, played to perfection by John Goodman). I can't begin to spill all the hilarity that happens within this one dreadfully short movie. There's some doozies, believe you me!

"O Plot, Where Art Thou?","Greetings again from the darkness.  Another quirky experience from the Coen's, who have provided some of my favorite moviegoing moments.  ""Blood Simple"" and ""Fargo"" are classics, and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""Barton Fink"" are right behind.  I was never a fan of ""Raising Arizona"", but this similar film has some really great touches.  No one casts more brilliantly than the Coens.  Not a fan of George Clooney, but he is outstanding in his role.  Many Coen regulars make their appearances (Holly Hunter, John Goodman, John Turturro) but I loved Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar. My favorite bits include the spoofs on legendary guitarist Robert(called Tommy in the film) Johnson selling his soul to the devil at the crossroads, and infamous bank robber George Nelson's (wonderfully played by Son of Sam actor Michael Badalucco) reaction to being called ""Baby Face"". As a film lover, I trust the Coens to push the envelope every time out.  Weak story in this one, but truly enjoyable nonetheless.

an original movie by the Coen brothers,"I liked ""O Brother, where art thou?"" although I've never been a fan of the Coen brothers. It is a funny idea to transpose ""the odyssey"" by Homère in America during the Great Depression in the thirties. This movie is a rather successful parody of Homère's story. Here, for instance, the three women by the stream replaced the mermaids and Penny (George Clooney's former wife) is a derivative of Penelope. Moreover, John Goodman took the role of the cyclops. The Coen brothers also obviously aimed at parodying several episodes of the Bible, notably in the last sequence with the flood.I also thought that the personality of the three main actors was very similar to Candide, the famous character created by the French writer Voltaire in the eighteenth century: they go through all kinds of adventure, either funny either dramatic in which they don't learn their lessons.If the humor isn't always well used in a relevant way or sometimes in a clumsy way, a few sequences are particularly successful: the Ku-Klux-Klan one. The music is also judiciously chosen and lends itself perfectly to the setting of the era. It's the same thing for the costumes.An original movie in which the directors don't think twice before laughing at their trio of actors. They're laughing at their credulity.",,Anonymous,Crime

One of my Favorite Movies of all Time,"Over the years, i've watched this movie maybe 20 or 30 times and every time I find something new to laugh about. The Coen Brother have crafted a hilariously dysfunctional buddy movie in O Brother, Where art Thou? which never ceases to make me smile. Loosely based off Homer's epic ""The Odyssey"", the story follows 3 men who, after escaping from a chain gang in depression era Mississipi, set out on a search for buried treasure left behind by George Clooney's character Ulysses Everett McGill. Along the way they meet all sorts of quirky characters which include an unscrupulous Bible Salesman, a horse eating redneck, a bank robbing lunatic, an ornery flour tycoon(who also happens to be Governor), a young man who sells his soul to the devil and a very peculiar blind man who owns a recording studio. It's safe to say the Coen Bros. took their time fleshing out the minor roles in this film and every new character you encounter feels very original. Credit is also due to the actors for performing these roles, but the writing in this movie is simply fantastic.Which brings me to my next point. The dialogue in this script is some of the funniest, most entertaining in films today. Everett McGill(played by Clooney) is the smooth talking, seemingly over-educated convict who self appoints himself leader of the escapees and is easily the bright spot of this film. Clooney's character is as hilarious as he is flamboyant and is definitely one of his best acting performances to date. Tuturro and Nelson are also quite funny as the bumbling idiot companions to McGill as they set out across Mississipi looking for the treasure. Some of the funniest moments in this movie involve simple conversations between the 3 and seeing the clearly uneducated companions try to make sense of McGill's over expanded vocabulary. Holly Hunter is also great in this movie as McGill's estranged wife and adds an extra dimension to the story that is quite interesting.The Coen Brothers are known for writing fleshed out, quirky characters in their movies and this one is no exception. The writing is witty and the acting is exceptional by everyone. The theme is meant to be light hearted while also maintaining a sense of realism for the time period in which it is set. I give them a lot of credit for staying true to the accuracy of the period but also keeping the feel of the film lighthearted and fun(Tough to do as depression era Mississipi was not a lighthearted or fun period in time at all). I also have to add that the score of this movie fits perfectly, mixing old time county/bluegrass to perfect effect. Overall, this is not only one of the best Coen Bros. films but, in my opinion, one of the best 50 films of all time. The humor is(mostly) clean as well so it can be enjoyed by a wider age group than many modern comedies. A can't miss film by some of the best Writers/Directors of our time.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A solid movie, though certainly not a 10","I watched this movie on recommendation of a reddit post calling it the best movie they had ever seen (in their opinion). It's a solid movie, delivers a few good laughs, a rotating crew of great, unique characters.For reasons I can't coherently articulate, this feels like the film Hail, Caesar! wishes it were. I think it's just because the Coen brothers have some visceral cinematic signature in all their films that I can't place. Any other parallels to draw between the two films would be solely placed in both Lead roles being played by George Clooney.Anyway, if there were two things to commend this film on, it would be the seesawing motif that juggles between religion, superstition, intellect, and coincidence and the musical choices. The Big Rock Candy Mountain is a perfect fit for the film. Like actually perfect, no exaggeration. It feels like the movie is sculpted around the song.Great solid movie, though I'd hardly put this as a top 10.

"For America, this is cultural Kudzu.","Following Fargo, and The Big Lebowski, writer, director, producer team Ethan and Joel Coen created a film no one could have expected. Viewers will enjoy the performances of Clooney, Turturro, and Nelson. As implied, the cinematography is lush and CGI is skillfully interwoven into the decidedly analog time and place represented herein. Solid and memorable musical performance and soundtrack add an integral sonic dimension to this barnstormin' hoedown.Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? is nostalgic psychedelia. The story and scenes float as if suspended in a lava lamp, or in the calm aftermath of flooded river valley. The picture is ""show"", not ""tell"" (there is literally no ""telling"" in the film). The plot is steeped in thick Christian revelry, but it's literally basis, Homer's Odyssey, pre-dates the Gospels by hundreds of years. Again, its not a matter of complete comprehension, what you see is what you get what you want to see. The music group R.E.M. comes to mind, with their speaking-in-tongues folklore. For America, this is cultural Kudzu, for the Coen brothers, rococo. Trials and tribulations. Lush. An once the film is both frivolous, but then again profound. In Greil Marcus's book, The Shape of Things to Come, he begins by expounding the ideology of America as an ideal / idea. That can be applied to the film.

I'll give it that much.  However, the subplots lead nowhere and don't add up to anything.  The main plot is just as shallow, as only parts of it are revealed, hidden within the different and, to put it nicely, ""unique"" characters.The characters are shallow and flat.  You know nothing about them except that they have run away (or R-U-N-O-F-T) from their prison.Conflict.  Every movie and book has one.  Every great story has a conflict that leads up to a climax and resolution.  However, O Brother, Where Art Thou? lacks this trait and tends to rely on subplots, such as the Sirens and the Ku Klux Klan rather than staying with its central plot.  This gets really annoying twenty minutes within the film, when the viewer is left behind just like the three escaped convicts were left behind the train.The movie is classified as comedy.

It's the only way I substantiate paying $30 for a movie (twisted, I know, because I plop twenties for music without blinking). I'd name my other films, but I hate subjecting myself to that employee hot-pick type of pigeonhole--although I'd be kidding no one to say that, yes, my picks are rather stereotypical. I enjoy dizzying rides through undulating plots without a fastened seatbelt. I expect all tangibles to be perfect. Humor is a pro--no, it's more than that, it's a prerequisite. Hell, it may be the only way to truly understand things like Depression, self-absorption, illegitimacy and other s**t-luck stories about ignorant people with cruel hearts... In short, as I always try to be, I prefer quality movies. And O Brother is certainly that.

His two friends in the movie, Pete and Delmar, were a couple of countrified hicks, and their acting was very convincing.  Then there was George Clooney's character.

An average Coen brothers presentation,"As fun as O Brother, Where Art Thou? can be, it has an overlong, dragged-out feel. There seems to be less material than a 105-minute feature can support. And, as is often the case in Coen Brothers movies, there is minimal character development. We learn a little bit about Ulysses, but almost nothing about anyone else. In large part, we're willing to stick with these three individuals because the actors playing them do a good job. Clooney radiates charisma as he slides into character.

I like it!,"This movie feels like a full-on Coen Brothers musical, reminiscent of the rich musical tapestry found in ""Inside Llewyn Davis."" It's got that classic Coen style with sharp, witty dialogue that really brings out the cultural vibe. Clooney, Nelson, and Turturro bring their A-game, adding tons of charisma against the backdrop of a meticulously crafted southern setting.Sure, there are some moments where CGI feels a bit out of place, but the use of Deakins' color palette really saves the day, keeping the visuals on point. There's this one scene with a car hitting a cow that looks so real, it actually made the American Humane Association take notice.

I'm right here.,"First off, if you haven't seen the old movie Sullivan's Travels, try toscare up a copy before watching this.  There's a real connection,and being aware of it just makes your appreciation of this moviethat much deeper.This should have gotten the Oscar for Best Picture last year.  Andafter giving it to this film, they should have stopped giving it forabout ten years.  It's that good.I love everything the Coen brothers have done, but this filmtranscends.  It's the best film I've seen in years.  It just may be theGreat American Novel.  High school English teachers say HuckFinn is, but it was too early:  America hadn't happened yet.  Highschool English teachers say Huck Finn was based on theOdyssey just like this film is.It's very easy for me to wax mystical about this film.  It's a mysticalfilm.  By setting it in a mythical version of Mississippi--a land thatexists in its purest form in old country blues and protobluegrasssongs--the Coens have tapped into the motherlode, the jugularvein of American myth.  This is the real America--the absurdity, thecruelty, the violence, the beauty, the deceit, the Dapper Dan.  Thisis the best America--the America that gave birth to Robert Johnsonand the Carter family.Critics used to say that the Coen brothers were technically brilliantand emotionally cold filmmakers.

The soundtrack is an utter headache... when it doesn't grate on your ears it puts you asleep.  The so-called ""comedy"" bits are way too subtle to get any entertainment out of it.  The plot makes no sense if you're not familiar with the Odyssey... and if you are, it just strikes you as a rediculous substitution.In its defense, any moment on the screen is good to look at... but the movie has no movement to it.

A colossal misjudgement,"What on earth were the Coen brothers thinking of? Why base a story about 1930s escaped convicts in Mississippi on Homer's Odyssey...?

Clooney plays an astonishingly annoying guy who prattles on in high falutin' language. Yes yes, we get it - but we still have to listen to him right through the film. The characters and the situations are not funny. There is not one memorable line in the whole movie (perhaps the biggest sin of all). The fantasy elements just make us care less. Scenes creak from one to the next with little meaning or continuity. The quirkiness is too smug and self-conscious. The in-jokes that presumably are meant to keep us nudging our neighbour and justify our time are too obscure and pointless. The clichés pile up: Chain gangs breaking rocks... Big Daddy figure running for governor... KKK shenanigans. All caricatures of caricatures of caricatures... Yawn... Soon we are begging to be shown something original.

""" . . . and the Oscar goes to . . . HOMER!""","Java Man Reviews ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000, PG-13). Directed by Joel Coen. Written by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen. Starring George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman and Holly Hunter. Running Time: 103 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW:During the 1930s, Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) and two of his prison pals, Pete and Delmar (Turturro and Nelson) escape from a Mississippi chain gang and embark upon a Depression era odyssey. While their primary goal is to locate an elusive buried treasure, Ulysses is also eager to return to his long-neglected wife, Penny (Hunter). Along the way, the trio's exploits parallel those of the hero of Homer's hexameters: They meet a blind prophet who guides their journey, a one-eyed brute (Cyclops) who thwarts it, and seductive sirens who pleasantly divert it. As the journey continues, ancient Greek mythology merges with modern American myth, with the landscape yielding up fabled characters from our own time, including outlaw George Nelson (""Don't call me Baby Face!"") and blues legend Robert Johnson (who sold his soul at the crossroads in exchange for guitar-playing genius.) Like the Odyssey, this movie moves magnificently toward an action-packed conclusion.REVIEW: 4 STARS OUT OF 4"" . . . and the Oscar goes to . . . HOMER!"" Though the Academy doesn't give out awards to 2,800-year-old epic poets, this film was nominated for best-adapted screenplay, with the ""material previously published"" being Homer's Odyssey. In earlier years, the Academy has given awards for original story, and once engraved a statuette for George Bernard Shaw for 1938's Pygmalion. (A bit of trivia: Shaw is the only person to have won both a Nobel Prize for Literature and an Oscar.) Whether it's Homer, Shakespeare, Shaw or the Coen Brothers, great stories make great movies.But the Coens ransack more than just Homer. The title of this film comes from Preston Sturges' 1941 classic, Sullivan's Travels, in which the title character wants to make a serious film, and has titled it ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" And of course, Sullivan's Travels, pays homage to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, which in turn looks back to Homer's Odyssey. The performances also run back and forth through time. At the center of it is Clooney who plays Ulysses like the reincarnation of Clark Gable, even down to the well-trimmed mustache. One of today's big stars plays one of yesterday's big stars playing a character whose first name is the Latin version of Odysseus. Again, it all comes back to Homer and his seminal story.Coen regulars also portray a parade of quirky characters. Goodman is intimidating as the one-eyed Bible thumper who parallels Homer's Cyclops. (Look for him too in a hilarious Ku Klux Klan scene where his sheet has only one eye hole.) As the poet's Penelope, Hunter embodies a more modern, less constant version of wifely virtue, with seven daughters and little patience for her absent husband. Turturro is completely submerged in the pensive character of Pete, while Nelson's deadpan Delmar is performed with perfect comic timing. Even cameos were played to perfection, such as Stephen Root's blind radio station owner.Roger Deakins' Oscar-nominated cinematography provides generous views of the Mississippi countryside, adding to the film's epic quality. The music, which both the characters and the filmmakers take seriously, accounts for much of the movie's spirit. The twangy tunes were put together by a collaboration of some of today's finest folk musicians, including T-Bone Burnett and Gillian Welch.Like epic poetry, film can carry us beyond the horizon, beyond hard times, to a place where the spirit of the Odyssey and the spirit of the American dream become one.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Truly Lamentable.  A Waste of talent.,"One of the worst films of the year.  The humor (or lack thereof) is lowbrow, the acting mediocre.  The script is jumbled, discontinuous, and inaccurate; the acting talent (Clooney, Goodman et. al) is wasted.Clooney takes on another one of his trademark leader-of-the-pack roles, searching for a large sum of money he stole away before being carted off to the penitentiary.  He and his two southern sidekicks nose their way into a number of odd adventures on the way.Perhaps the defining (read: worst) moment of the film is when the three attend a KKK gathering.  The scene´s topic is too serious to be funny, but too poorly done to be convincing.  The resulting scene leaves the viewer unsure of how to react - usually eliciting a hesitant chuckle, followed by a long, confused silence.I saw this movie in Spain, and the entire theatre agreed in a hearty unison when I concisely and audibly summed up the movie as the credits started to roll: ""Mierda!""",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""An old-timey harmony thing""","America is a young country, but it is not without a rich mythology. We may not think of it in this way, but the modern era has its folk tales, and they are defined in literature, theatre and of course cinema. In recent years some of the best American folk tales have been woven by that eminent fraternal writer-director team, the brothers Coen. O Brother Where Art Thou? was among their most profound yet playful.In writing this picture the brothers weave together numerous cultural motifs, many of them from the movies. The title itself is that of the fictional movie in Sullivan's Travels. We see depression-era legends such as the good-natured bank robber and the blues guitarist selling his soul alongside cinematic references as disparate as The Wizard of Oz and Doctor Strangelove. All this is loosely structured around Homer's Odyssey, drawing together the strands of this modern mythology with that of the ancient world.And as a directorial team, the Coens have a mark of simplicity and gentleness which allows the best elements of the movie to shine through. The pacing of each scene is considered and languid. This doesn't make things boring; it allows us to savour each glorious country scene or earthy expression. There is so much packed into each moment, showing us a rich world beyond the storyline. The Coens bring out period details, not through the wider shots but through seemingly inconsequential bits of background business, like the copy of Ward's catalogue that props up Hogwallop's boy on his seat.The resultant movie is both witty and meaningful, but also beautiful and human. The brothers Coen show us a people whose peculiarities are just as beautiful or as harsh as the landscapes around them. Filled with deliberate anachronism (""You Are My Sunshine"" for example was not written until some years after it's set) and broad stretches of logic, O Brother Where Art Thou is not so much a historical movie as a mystical yet familiar dream of America's past.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The plot was pedestrian and predictable and boring. There was no clear direction in the movie. To compare this piece of garbage to Homer's Odyssey is ludicrous. I think the Odyssey has not been produced on film because of its complex structure and Hollywood's general ignorance of this classic epic. People who have not read the Odyssey will be mislead by the film's advertised similarities to Homer's timeless work. Unlike Homer's brilliance in content and presentation and organization of his long poem, this waste of viewer's time is a below-average attempt to be funny and entertaining.

An Overall Fun Film,"Retellings of ancient fiction and writings are always an interesting genre - What do they keep or change? How does the story now present itself to a modern audience? It's interesting how this movie presents itself as a comedy, and how it twists the ancient myth into a setting in the 1930's. There's a window to tell this story to new audiences, and I think they did a pretty clever job of translating characters and ideas from the original text in this film. Overall, I found it to be a good comedy and the characters dynamics to actually be quite interesting. I thought the camerawork was pretty nice, and the pace of scenes was well done - for the most part. Sometimes they could move quickly, and that kind of goes into one of my few gripes - the main character. I know he's supposed to be very flawed, and that's fine for him and his character development (which honestly didn't feel like he changed much). It's really probably a personal annoyance that I find he's a bit annoying - not even in just a ""he's a sleazy guy"" type of way, which his character is supposed to be, but it was done in a way where it was a bit annoying to listen to. My only other thing wrong with this film is how they handled the wife. I know in the original text she has an...interesting character, but especially the way the whole story with them was resolved: it was just a bit strange to me, and the ending seemed abrupt. But I do think this was a fun movie and an interesting one to watch especially after reading the Odyssey itself and seeing the parallels.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

American cinematic masterpiece,"This film hits every mark needed to qualify as a true classic. I'm not a slapstick comedy fan and i don't enjoy the juvenile situation comedies, so this film was indeed a curiosity to me when it was first released since it was based on ""The Odyssey"". But I had no earthly idea that its purely American themes of prison convicts on the lamb, stumbling/singing ones way to instant fame, seeking an imaginary fortune and political opportunism would meld into a story that is both charming and, thanks to Homer, intricate. The Coen Brothers were extremely fortunate to have cast George Clooney as the quick-talking philosopher Everet and Tim Blake Nelson as the simple-minded but revolutionary Delmer. John Turturro's Pete is Oscar worthy, enough said. The much glorified soundtrack is pure inspiration and deserves much credit for making this film so remarkable. The Three Stooges never had so many wonderful discussions nor displayed the innocence that the Soggy Bottom Boys put into their efforts. ""Being steeped in old timey"" is one of this film's best qualities for the cinematography is remarkably characteristic of the Depression laden South and the Coens use Dixie's traditions and its institutions to their full advantage.

A good comedy adventure set in 1930s Mississippi,"I first learned about this movie years ago, possibly around the time it was first released, and first heard ""I am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" from the soundtrack soon afterwards. However, it wasn't until just over a year ago that I finally actually saw ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (I guess that was because I didn't watch many movies during the early 2000s). With my first viewing, I wasn't amazed, but it was still enough for me to give positive feedback, and I don't think that changed with my very recent second viewing.The story is loosely based on the ancient poem, ""The Odyssey"", by Homer, but takes place in Mississippi, during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete, and Delmar are three convicts who escape from a chain gang. After doing so, they set out on a journey to reach the buried loot that Everett speaks of! Along their way, they encounter many people who influence their trip, and may cause them trouble, including sirens, a crazy bankrobber named George ""Babyface"" Nelson, a Bible salesman named Big Dan Teague, a Ku Klux Klan lynch mob, etc. Trying to avoid being caught is not the only challenge that these three convicts have to face!I'm not sure about the first time I watched this, but while I watched it a second time, I had trouble staying into it early in the film, and trouble seeing the motion picture as much of a comedy. However, I eventually found myself more into it, and started laughing more, even though I may not have found any of the gags absolutely hilarious. Overall, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a good comedy adventure (not great, but good), with the memorable ""I am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" song, as well as some crazy characters (which is mostly what makes it funny), for those who want that.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The story wants to ramble, but the direction is sloppy and clumsy. The film's only asset is the music. I am not a Coen brothers fan; I find their work cold, mechanical and lacking simple humanity. That is fine for a stylish film noir like Blood Simple, but cruel, almost sadistic in films like Raising Arizona or Fargo. They are akin to Kubrick (not necessarily a compliment) in that they have neither the desire nor the talent to explore human nature or emotions in anything but the most superficial manner. Thinking about O Brother, I can't help but think that Robert Altman, in his prime, could have made something fascinating and wonderful out of this material.

If you are the type of person that gets stuck on the story without recognizing the subtle nuances presented visually, symbolically, and verbally then don't bother.  You will miss the point entirely.

The Coens done good.,"Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, the Coen Brothers' 'O Brother, Where Art The hou?' is the saga of Everett, Pete and Delmar (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson), three bumbling criminals on the run in the deep south, hoping to dig up a hidden stash of treasure before the valley where it is buried is flooded. At the start of their journey, they meet a blind man who prophecises that they will find a fortune, though it will not be the one they seek; indeed, life for the trio takes many strange and unexpected turns before fate smiles upon them, their adventure involving encounters with many unusual characters (including three sirens, a Bible-selling conman, a bluesman who has sold his soul to the devil, infamous bank robber Babyface Nelson, and the KKK).Combining smart witticisms with superb slapstick and American folklore, the Coens have crafted a sparkling comedic delight, helped no end by excellent performances, not just from the three endearing leads, but everyone involved, the superb supporting cast including such wonderful talent as John Goodman, Holly Hunter, and Charles Durning. The film also benefits from stunning photography (much of it sepia-tinted to add to the depression-era ambience) and a superb soundtrack bristling with 'Old Time America' bluegrass and country music (if you're not already a fan of the genre, you might well be by the end of the film), making it a treat for both eyes and ears. If only the film had smell-o-vision, so we could appreciate the odour of Ulysses' Dapper Dan pomade as well...",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Feels like a walk through a fairytale-forest,"I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers and I think this is one of there best films. Well at least it is the one that is the most fun watching. If you compare the different Coen brother films you'll see that every film has its own style and use of colours and no two films are the same. Because of this every Coen brothers' movie is a surprise and this one certainly is.The story is about three prisoners who escape and go on a quest to find the treasure one of them as hidden before he ended up in prison. From the moment they escape the most strange and amazing events start to happen. At least that is how the viewer and the three main characters experience everything. In reality nothing strange happens, but the Coen brothers succeeded in making every little thing that happens seem very mysterious. For example: three women who are washing their clothes in the river, sounds like nothing mysterious, but the Coen brother make you believe the three women are sirens. The movie is full with little things like this, which makes it some kind of eerie, thrilling, fairytale, in which everything seems and is possible.The events occurring are not solely eerie end thrilling, as told previously, but are also good for a lot of smiles. Yes, smiles not laughs it is not a comedy, but it is a feel good movie and a good one. If the film ends you will have a big smile on your face, which will not disappear for quite some time. The movie feels like a walk through a fairytale-forest and that feeling will stay with you for some days.Like in the Coen brothers' movie Fargo the most important colour was white, this movie also has one most used colour, this time it is brown and yellow. In every shot these colours are present and dominant. Also there is a lot of use of filters. Those two things together give the movie the dreamy, mysterious appearance. Because of this the movie is full of beautiful shots and even that alone makes it worthwhile to see the movie.To conclude: if you want to see a movie which is fun to watch, gives you a happy feeling, has a good and unpredictable story, gets you thinking, has great actors and sublime directing, than this is the movie you want to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Authentic southern culture of the depression era,"One of the many reasons that this film and story was so successful, is that it offers a true depiction and glimpse of part of depression era life in the deep south. It also offers a taste of that culture, social mannerism and behavior that is very interesting. As opposed to sliding by with approximating the southern personality, the director was able to pinpoint and authenticate the southern character and mannerism almost perfectly. It shows that everyone in the production either did their research, or came from that region of the country originally.Homer's Oddessey was well adapted to the time and place depicted here. Just the right amount of pathos, irony, comedy, hard luck, and hard times give the principle characters something to really work with. And all of them have accomplished this in excellent fashion. John Turturro, particularly, has accomplished the quintessential down on his luck southern boy so well that he is almost the standard prototype of all time.In addition to showing a historically accurate picture of southern rural life in the 30's, the film also deals briefly with the then condition of the Ku Klux Clan and its psychotic cultural behavior. We see, in this adaption, that the average African American was not hated and hunted down by all white men, but only by a small percentage of fanatical tribesman. It also suggests in a more masked way, that the Clan's behavior was highly influenced by a gangster mentality. Many of the participants in this behavior would not behave that way on their own, but only when masked, and in a large group. Sort of like sheep. For the most part, people of all colors were willing to get along at that time. But like today, race relations still had a ways to go.Another treat was the depiction of the prison chain gang. Although not shown quite as hopeless and harsh as in Cool Hand Luke, Oh Brother does touch on the helplessness an inmate must feel, albeit done with a humorous slant. In this film, inmates are observed getting along well with each other, accepting their state of affairs, and working away without too much worry, frustration and fatigue. In real life, the chain gang was brutal, to the point where many of the inmates were on the verge of collapse almost everyday.Finally, since this observation is mostly about the depression era south, it was very enjoyable to experience the progress of the music of the region and the period, when the bluegrass style was in its infancy. The ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" were great, as was the audience they played for. This was simply another feature of this film that was done precisely as it was when the story takes place.For anyone who has not read the Oddyssey, or has not been in the deep south, or just wishes to enjoy a story well researched and well presented, then this is the story for him. It is an enjoyable film from start to finish, with flair and creativity to spare.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

In this sometimes weird and uneasy trip, they find a saucy Governor (Durning), a thief (Goodman) and even Baby Face Nelson, the famous gangster.

"O Brother, How Silly","""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" is just the Coen Brothers riding the success of ""Fargo"", and I think the ride has to stop.  Though this movie isn't as bad as the truly awful ""Hudsucker Proxy"", it has the same queasy elements, worst of all being the Coen brothers penchant for trying to recreate the cinematic style of the 1930s, as they did in Hudsucker Proxy.I did enjoy the three characters played by Clooney, Turturro, and Nelson, and really enjoyed watching them perform as the ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" (I hope have that right, it's from memory).  The movie would have been much better if it had been about the group and a musical tour of the South they do, instead of the whole lame ""Odyssey"" thing.

a rollicking good time,"The Coen Brothers (them being Joel and Ethan) have a pretty good film here; recommendable to say the least. If it's not one of their very best it might be because it goes for so much within the framework of the Odyssey that it threatens to run off the tracks. But there's a great deal of originality here too, from the KKK musical number to the tommy-gunned cows to the horny-toad mystery following the ""sirens"", to a great final hoe-down involving men with fake beards. It's crazy, and it works most of the time. It's an odyssey inspired by Homer, though it isn't exactly ""based"" on it; from what I described up above it's really a jumping off point, as if the brothers took what they remembered from the story after reading it in school, and then put on their own ideas for the characters based on who could best play them. The film takes place in 1930's Mississippi where 3 convicts (Tim Blake Nelson, John Tuturro and in a Clark Gable-like face, George Clooney) escape to go look for a hidden treasure, but, like in the original Homer odyssey, there are their sidetracks (sirens) and villains (John Goodman does a good job as this villain).

"Golly, Toto, I think we're in Mississippi","OBWAT is extraordinary fun, as a 1937 Depression-era comic retelling of the travels of Odysseus.

""The Odyssey"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" both have main characters obsessed with getting home, and the Coens have built a richly layered entertainment that call upon a range of cultural allusions to make a point.By the way, the movie within OBWAT is ""Myrt and Marge,"" an undistinguished Broadway-backstage movie that features the Three Stooges singing . . . much like the Soggy Bottom Boys.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
O Brother Where Art Thou?,"O Brother Where Art Thou? Is a comedy satire based on the historical writing of Homer's Odyssey. Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, the film stars George Clooney (Everett) John Turturro (Pete), Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar). The movie is set in the Deep South during the great depression. The three main characters are trying to break free from the Mississippi State Prison. The ring leader is Everett and he convinces the other two to break free in hopes to find a buried treasure that they must get to in four days before it is washed away. The movie provides plenty of different adventures for the trio all the while they are being chased by Sheriff Cooley and they must stay one step ahead of the law while still maintaining their moral. The characters hope the blind mans prophecy will come true!This movie offers a new and exciting way to view and interpret. The film offer a wide variety of angle shots and uses panning often to show the events that played out earlier to show how and why the characters end up in the predicaments that they do. Music and transitions are used in comparison to guide the audience thorough rough and rowdy scenes, to naturally flowing scenes. This is done in such a way that the audience doesn't even know, giving more attention to be paid on the film itself. During the trios adventure they are constantly being followed by Sheriff Cooley. When such scenes are present in the film, the transition and editing is tenser and the music reflects. Also in happier times in the film, the trio performs as the Soggy Bottom Boys with much popularity.The music reflect this as well. The lighting and color are used in such a way in the film to represent the sepia tone feeling that was popular during that time period.This movie is very fun and exciting to watch. It offers a modern day twist on the odyssey and the Coen Brothers keep you guessing at what will happen next. I recommend this movie to anyone! It offers a great storyline for young and old alike!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Smartly captures the mythology of the Deep South through music,"The Depression-era Deep South comes alive like mythological Ancient Greece in Joel and Ethan Coen's ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""An adaptation of Homer's ""Odyssey,"" the Coen brothers came to the realization that the folklore of the Deep South is the heart of American myth and tales of long journeys and they marry Homer's epic to this aesthetic in a way that respects the original story and American folklore while imbuing them with a semi-silly tone.The 1930s Mississippi setting also makes a difference; post-Civil War and pre-Civil Rights, the South is caught between past traditions and forces of change and the American Dream feels well out of reach yet not impossibly beyond grasping. The trio of escaped chain-gang convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) are in search of more than a million dollars that Everett has hidden back home, money that will change their lives. Their long journey takes varying episodic twists and turns as they encounter all manner of characters, good and evil.The heart and soul of the film, however, is its music. Folks songs, hymns, spirituals and more have both a pivotal role in the film in terms of plot, in addition to providing the mythical tone. Songs are often tied to strange turns of events in the story, such as three mysterious women singing along the river and enchanting the runaways (obvious parallel to the ""Odyssey""). The gang even picks up Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), who went down to the crossroads and sold his soul to the devil to play guitar, the very legend that started blues music.The film's arrangement ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow,"" the song that the trio plus Johnson sing into a can for $10 under the pseudonym ""The Soggy Bottom Boys"" when they come across a blind radio producer (Stephen Root), proves strangely key to the story and is unbelievably catchy to boot. Music in the film, as it so often did in the South, brings people together and makes a difference. The Coens' film has as much to say about that notion as it does anything else.The Coens' irreverent, silly but whip-smart humor also pervades ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" The dynamic of the loquacious and self- absorbed Everett along with hotheaded Pete and the clueless optimist Delmar has endless appeal, even when it's clear early on that it's not a healthy one. The oddball characters along the way, especially George ""Don't Call Him Babyface"" Nelson (Michael Badalucco), John Goodman's Big Dan Teague and rival politicians Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning) and Homer Stokes (Wayne Duvall) provide a similarly intriguging effect to the many creatures Odysseus and crew meet in their travels.""O Brother"" stands testament to the power of American folklore, that even for a country barely 200 years old, there's a certain magic in it that the Coen brothers tap into with the appropriate use of magical realism and narrative technique that resembles Greek mythology. Its concept and music may be more exciting than its plot, but ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a special film to behold of a genre all its own.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The most fun I've ever had watching a (relatively) non-violent film...,"If nothing else, this film proves just how short-changed we've been by the music industry since about 1985 or so. When I was told the film relies on numerous American musical numbers from the 1930s, I was expecting to spend a lot of time squirming in my seat from sheer agony. Surprisingly, I almost felt compelled to sing along with whomever dubbed the vocals, a radical difference compared to the mood that the crappy synthetic drum-machine garbage of such films as The Corruptor and The Replacement Killers puts me in. If I could put the music of this film in the same boat as one that is set in modern times, it'd be Desperado. The reliance upon musical talent rather than trendiness to sell this component of the film works well in its overall favour.That is not to say the film's only plus is the music. The cinematography is beautiful, and it will teach you why television screens are being made wider with the advent of digital television. If anyone tries to tell the distributor they want a panned and scanned version of this film, I'm going to kick their butts into the middle of the 22nd century. Even when there is nothing going on outside of the central focus of the shot, the wide, sweeping plains of 1930s America keep one's eyes focused upon the entire picture, not just whomever happens to be speaking. This is why 16x9 Enhanced DVD is the ONLY way to view films.George Clooney is delightful in his role as Ulysses Everett McGill, while John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson provide wonderful comic fodder in their roles. Chris Thomas King is delightful as Tommy Johnson, the guitarist who sold his soul to the devil at the crossroads. Their recording session was delightful to sit through, and it is a hilarious reflection on the times that they could cut a record while on the run, and then travel across the state, blissfully unaware that they have a number one record on their hands. Contrast this with modern pop ""stars"" who can't get enough of themselves or their record company's attempts to make them out to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. There is a moral to this part of the story: truly good music only needs word of mouth to make people want to listen to it.Oh, and the Sirens scene... now that was worth watching the entire film for, even if it was quite bizarre. In five minutes, we have a more pleasant image to look at than the entirety of Sirens, the meandering (not to mention ugly) film of Norman Lindsay's story that was filmed not far from where I live.

Clooney rises to the challenge of playing a period character with nice touches of slapstick enhancing his characteristically slick delivery.Clooney is ably aided and abetted by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, who play hayseeds ""dumber than a bag of hammers"" who accompany Ulysses on his quest. Turturro, who made his name playing more modern urban characters, does particularly well as the most ornery member of the group.The characters may not be that deep, but then they never are in Coen Brothers' films. They exist only to serve the film, and in this case, they serve quite well. The Coens are not taking things too seriously this time around, as if incorporating the highbrow structure of re-doing Homer freed them to concentrate on entertainment and audience immersion instead of arty flourishes.You really feel like you are back in 1937, with the attention to detail in look and sound. When Ulysses curses about his favorite hair pomade not being available in a general store, the proprietor admonishes him this is ""a public place"" and he won't stand for such talk. The ""old-timey"" musical score put the film on the map, and you get a rich gumbo of bluegrass and Jimmie Rodgers-era country music, with some blues and gospel thrown in. It's such a throwback, it comes across as exotic. Then again, you could say the same of the whole film.Some of the bits work better than others. John Goodman, great in the otherwise erratic Coen Brothers film ""The Big Lebowski,"" is a weak link as the film's version of Homer's menacing Cyclops, and Holly Hunter is a bit one-note as Ulysses' adamantine wife.But any weaknesses are easy to overlook when you get such wonderful bits as the campaign of Gov. O'Daniel (Charles Durning, never better), a bank-heist spree with George ""don't call him Babyface"" Nelson and Stephen Root's deliciously goofy turn as a bug-eyed music promoter who re-directs Ulysses' fortunes. The music is very cleverly integrated throughout the film; even the Ku Klux Klan gets to perform a pretty cool number.Watching ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" you'll wonder where the time went, and want to see it again for all the clever bits of Coen business you missed the first time. And if that last image of the film isn't forever burned in some corner of your mind, there is something serious wrong with your soul.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Leaden,"When the trailer for ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" first came out, I remember watching it and thinking that the movie looked like it was supposed to be quirky and funny but the quirky and funny parts had been left out of the preview.  I felt pretty much the same way once I saw the actual film. Clooney is fun to watch, and the bits about his hair cream made me chuckle a few times, but, I'm sorry, I need more than hair cream jokes.  It was one of those movies where a lot transpires on the screen, but nothing really happens.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
You'll laugh!  You'll cry!,"The Coen Brothers do it again!  This is their best movie since Raising Arizona!  This movie was based on the tale of Homer's The Oddessy, in a 1930's setting in the Deep South.  Three bumbling and inept convicts escape from a chain gang to find a treasure.  They get into a lot of mishaps, and they meet a variety of characters who bare resemblence to the characters from the original Oddessy.  (i.e. the singing whores were supposed to be The Sirens.)George Clooney gives an outstanding performance as Ulysess.  George Clooney is great in whatever movies he makes, which is probably why he has captivated so many fans (like me) since his role as Dr. Ross on ER.  O Brother Where Art Thou is a heart-touching, riveting, and uplifting movie. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again.  I give it 4 stars!",,Anonymous,Crime
