North by Northwest and then some,"Hitchcock at his sharpest. Art and commerce in a delicious salad with all the right ingredients. A brisk screenplay by Ernest Lehman a Cary Grant that is just pure delight, Eva Marie Saint fresh out of her Oscar from ""On the Waterfront"" is an icy blonde with a brain.

I finally get how great it is: Hitch infuses his wrong-man caper with ironic movie language and reality-be-damned escapism and suspense.,"Its Hitch's most briskly entertaining movie, and one of his most comic, adventure-caper type movies, largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant. But its also one of his most suspenseful - in the fact that Grant is being recognised as someone else, and that he may be put in jail for someone else's crime.I've finally come to realise just how great North by Northwest is. The reason you should love Hitchcock is he put entertainment upfront.  Hitchcock was not interested in whether this or that would happen in real life: he was interested in what would make the most entertaining scene for the movie. North by Northwest is a peak in this regard. The dialogue and situations intentionally throw reality to the wind - the double-entendre dialogue in the love scenes is not supposed to be the way people talk!If you said to Hitchcock ""as if he'd keep driving"" or ""as if she'd do that"" - he would just laugh at you and say you've missed the point. This is 100% movieland, and once you get used to the fact, and that this is not a fault in the film, but done intentionally, you'll love it. Its expressionistic - everything happens in movie language: the people laughing at Grant in the elevator, the way he keeps driving drunk near the beginning, the way he grabs the knife and everyone stares at him after someone's been stabbed.It flirts with the idea of identity. I thought it was interesting how Grant first is dismissing, then incredulous that people should be calling him by another name; then, as the tries to find out who this guy is, he enters the hotel room of this new identity, then he puts the suit on, and finally he identifies himself as George Kaplan.A succession of fantastic, memorable scenes, a great leading man in Grant, and one of Hermann's essential Hitch scores make for a movie i can put on at any time.10/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enormously entertaining film from Alfred Hitchcock!,"My favourite director, Alfred Hitchcock has directed many classics like Psycho, Rear Window and Vertigo, and I will say that this deserves to be up there among his best. I absolutely loved it! The best aspect of this movie is the always charming Cary Grant in a brooding and entertaining performance as Roger Thornhill, a man wanted for the murder of a diplomat. Solidly supporting him all the way are the lovely Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendell and oily James Mason as the villainous Vandamme. They are further advantaged by some excellent camera-work and a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The script is focused and suspenseful, and Hitchcock's direction ensures the film rarely slips, even if some of the complicated plot does fly over people's heads. The climax though is simply the icing on the cake. Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, which I will give a 9.5/10. Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of my absolute favourites!,"North by Northwest will need no introduction to most movie-goers. It's a classic, greatly admired by audiences and critics alike. The story about a befuddled ad-executive fleeing from spies and the police (the spies want him dead because he knows of their plot, the police want him captured because they think he's behind a murder) is done at a breakneck pace and deals with Hitchcock's most frequently used theme: an innocent man on the run.Cary Grant is urbane and smooth as the hero. James Mason oozes silky menace as the principal villain (Martin Landau also plays a villain, giving his character a seriously nasty toughness). Eva Marie Saint is simply fabulous as the woman whose loyalties seems torn between good and bad.The set pieces are rightly considered to be moments of cinematic genius. Grant's escape from a crop-duster; the fight atop Mount Rushmore; the auction house bluff; the drunken car journey; the murder at the UN building.... each scene is brilliantly devised by script writer Ernest Lehmann and just as brilliantly filmed by director Hitchcock. Everyone should see this movie... it's a masterpiece.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Strangers on a train,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is one of the best films in his long and distinguished career. Part of the success of the movie lies in the screen play by Ernest Lehman, one of the best writers of that era. Also, the haunting music by Mr. Hitchcock's usual collaborator, Bernard Hermann, adds texture to what we are seeing. Together with all the above mentioned qualities, ""North by Northwest"" was photographed by Robert Burks and was edited by George Tomasini, both men did outstanding jobs to enhance a film that shows a mature and inspired Alfred Hitchcock.The film works because of the witty dialog Mr. Lehman wrote. This has to be one of the riskiest projects undertaken by Mr. Hitchcock because of the sexiness Eva Kendall exudes throughout the film and the repartee between her and Roger Thornhill. The film mixes adventure and romance that aren't put ons, as one feels what one's watching to be really happening.Much has been said in this forum as to the values of this classic, so we shall only add our pleasure in seeing this masterpiece any time it turns on cable. In fact, the film hasn't dated, the way some others of the same period have. The highlights of the film are the sequences involving the crop duster, the train ride to Chicago where Eve and Roger first meet, the auction, and the Mount Rushmore climax.This is one of the best contributions by Cary Grant to any of his work with the director. Roger Thornhill is one of the best roles Mr. Grant played, during his long career. His chemistry with Eva Marie Saint is perfect. This young actress added class and elegance to the picture. James Mason and Martin Landau played villains convincingly. Jesse Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll, and the rest of the supporting cast is excellent.""North by Northwest"" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best crafted films thanks to the brilliant people that came together to work in it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Top-notch suspense /adventure film still looks great after 40 years!,"For Christmas this year, I received my first to-own DVD: Hitchcock's classic, NORTH BY NORTHWEST. After over 40 years, this rip-racing adventure-thriller still packs a punch and looks great on widescreen. This movie came along during a renaissance period for the Old Master, between masterpieces like VERTIGO and PSYCHO, but this excursion into the world of suspense is so different from anything else Hitchcock had created up to that point. Never did he challenge our endurance to keep still in our seats for such a long period of time, and yet the film's 135 minutes go by so fast it could only be explained by movie magic itself.Cary Grant is one of those actors that a filmgoer either falls in love with or deeply envies. His debonair manner is displayed to the full in this film, even though the peril that his character goes through would cause any normal dude to break into a maddening sweat.  The dialogue Roger Thornhill delivers alongside Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) in this film is sometimes too hilarious to be true, but wouldn't any woman fall for it? (I'm merely guessing here)  Ernest Lehman's screenplay is so lighthearted and yet very ominous. With all the traps and pitfalls Grant goes through in this film, you would have to find comedy in it. Grant does and to great appeal. I absolutely love the sequence at the auction when Roger tries to get himself arrested by yelling out flaky bids and accusing the auctioneer of selling junk worth no more than $8.  I also admire the scenes with Saint on the train to Chicago; I was tempted to jot down some of his pick-up lines, but then I realized it's just a movie (or is it?)Hitchcock was famous throughout his career of setting up death-defying sequences with major landmarks as backdrops. Here, Mount Rushmore will never be looked at the same again afterwards. We may never enter the United Nations again without peering behind our backs for a notorious knife-thrower. And, I dare say, I will never walk alongside a highway where a cropduster could swoop at any minute. I love the line during the Rushmore incident when Grant says his two ex-wives left him because he lived too dull a life. Go figure!It has been said that Hitchcock's many films each contain a personal side of the director inside them. The archetypes of the Master of Suspense are here amid the chasing and running across the U.S. The mysterious blonde, played to a tee by Eva Marie Saint, is a common fixture of many Hitchcock jaunts. Saint joins Grace Kelly and Tippi Hedren in this feature. The protagonist is again awkward when faced with  the opposite sex, but unusually casual when wrapped up in danger. The hero has an attachment to his mother, continually under his nurturing wing. And of course, the macguffin has fun with us again (government secrets my foot!)Whenever I see action-packed epics today like ""The Fugitive"" or the James Bond series, they all seem to quiver in comparison to this film. It amazes me that Hitchcock is able to hold the audience in the palm of his hand throughout the whole length of the journey. We become Grant as he runs away from the police and the secret agents who have chosen him as their dupe. But throughout the squabble, we sense that Grant is getting off on the whole jaunt, just as we want the chase to continue, not looking at our watches for a minute. However, it's fascinating to note that Roger Thornhill is not a born adventurer, nor is he an archeologist with a flair for escaping impossible situations. We are experiencing the Cary Grant in all of us, running away from an enemy we do not know they are or what they want. Is this symbolism of some kind? I say who cares; just watch the film and have fun!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A towering achievement.,"This is Hitchcock's best film  quite an accomplishment, considering how many great films he created. And after half a century, ""North By Northwest"" holds up beautifully. This film has it all: suspense, glamour, humor, and images that capture the imagination and remain etched in memory. The legendary crop-dusting sequence alone is a master class in the art of pure cinema. Like the rest of the film, it's brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed. All the elements come together to produce the finest form of entertainment. Bernard Herrmann's frantic fandango captures the complexity and pace of the action. Ernest Lehman's script is full of sophisticated dialogue. Performances are spot on. Has Cary Grant ever been more engaging? Is James Mason the ultimate in charming villains?

From The Master of Suspense Came the Daddy of the Modern Adventure Thrillers,"Many feel this is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest American movie, and I agree! NORTH BY NORTHWEST is the Hitchcock film to end all Hitch films, with all his pet themes covered with maximum wit, panache, and suspense, as well as a romance between Cary Grant and a soignée Eva Marie Saint that's as tender as it is sexy. Grant has never been more engaging and dashing (literally and figuratively :-), though the smoothly villainous James Mason nearly out-suaves him. My husband and I have joked that if Mason had played Thornhill, the film would have been over in mere moments. With all due respect to Grant, if the imperious, unshakably confident Mason asked the Glen Cove police, ""Do you honestly believe that this happened the way you think it did?"" they would immediately reply, ""No, sir, you must be right, you're free to go, sorry we bothered you."" :-) Also boasts a great early performance by a reptilian young Martin Landau as Mason's possessive henchman, as well as one of Oscar nominee Ernest Lehman's best screenplays (in fact, he borrowed liberally from it for his script for the film version of THE PRIZE starring Paul Newman) and one of Bernard Herrmann's finest scores.

Okay....But It Seemed A Lot Better When I Was A Kid,"When I started collecting videos in earnest (by the thousands), I was excited to get this film. I had such fond remembrances of seeing it on the big screen when I was young teen. I remember being terrified when Cary Grant was being chased by the crop duster and then awed at the end with the climactic scene on Mount Rushmore. I saw it maybe a decade or so later on television and enjoyed it again.Well, seeing the film again five years ago on DVD as a 50-something-year-old turned out to be a major disappointment, mainly because the first hour was so boring. The beginning had scenes that looked too dated and worse, were drawn out too long, such as Grant's drunk scene and the romance between he and Eva Marie Saint.Once Grant goes on the run, the story improves noticeably and mixing in some comedy with the drama was a good move. From that point, it's still the fun film I had remembered but, overall, didn't have the suspense anymore and, to this day, I believe is an overrated Alfred Hitchcock film. The more I see of Hitch's old films, the more disappointed I am, with the exception of Psycho and Rear Window.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A perfect film for a rainy, cold October day","I saw this film for the first time when I was a freshman in college as part of an english class I took entitled ""writing and the movies"".  Little did I realize that I would be seeing a film that would stay with me to this day and in essence become one of my all time favorites.  Then, a few years ago, I caught it on the big screen at the Fine Arts theater in downtown Chicago. I remember that it was a rainy, cold October day.  Perfect weather for a Hitchcock film I thought to myself.For me, half of the fun of North by Northwest is its incredible story.  This film has something for everyone within it: a little comedy, a little romance, great snappy dialogue and more action than any Bruce Willis Die Hard film combined.  Hitchcock was a master at this and in North by Northwest he lets his genius shine through totally.  It seems to me that whenever I watch it, everyone who made this film from Cary Grant on down had nothing but sheer fun making it.  Perhaps my two favorite scenes are the infamous ""crop-duster"" sequence and the last twenty minutes or so at Mount Rushmore.I must give special mention to Ernest Lehman who yet again managed to write a screenplay that totally knocks your socks off.  How he came up with the idea, I've not a clue, but what an idea it is.  The screenplay itself was nominated for an Academy Award that year, but lost to Pillow Talk.  North by Northwest was also nominated for Best Set Decoration and Best Film Editing, but lost to Ben-Hur in both categories.All in all, what a film. If you haven't seein it, do so ASAP. North by Northwest just reinforces my belief that Alfred Hitchcock was one of the greatest directors of all time. Period.My rating: 4 stars",,Anonymous,Mystery
Superb Hitchcock Thriller!,"""North By Northwest"" is another of Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers where an ordinary man is put into an extraordinary situation. As in most of these movies, the hero has to quickly adapt to his situation or perish.This time it is Cary Grant who is thrust into a world of international intrigue when is mistaken by villain James Mason for an American operative named George Kaplan (the film's ""McGuffan"" by the way). Along the way he is seduced by Mason's mistress (Eva Marie Saint) while being pursued by Mason and his cronies from New York to Chicago to South Dakota and ultimately to Mount Rushmore for the film's climax.""North By Northwest"" is full of classic Hitchcock moments. First,there is Grant's frustration and fear as he tries to explain to Mason that he is not the person they are seeking. Next, the scene in the cornfield where Grant is isolated and attacked by a plane is pure Hitchcock. Then we have the art auction where he cleverly escapes Mason's henchmen and finally, the finale at Mount Rushmore in a scene reminiscent of a similar one in ""Sabotage"" (1942) (which took place at the top of the Statue of Liberty).The cast, as in most Hitchcock films is excellent. Grant is understandably confused and frightened as the the hero, Eva Marie Saint has never been sexier as the femme fatale, James Mason is suave and sinister as the villain and Martin Landau in an early role, is good as Mason's chief henchman. Hitchcock regular Leo G. Carroll is cold heartedly sinister as the ""professor"". Jesse Royce Landis as Grant's mother (she was about Grant's real age) is wasted and unnecessary to the plot.The only problem that I have with this and other Hitchcock films is his over reliance on back projection and soundstage ""exteriors"". Other than that. ""North By Northwest"" has to be considered as one of Hitchcock's best. Watch for Hitchcock's hilarious cameo appearance at the end of the opening credits.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

They said I led too dull a life.,"One can argue about is 'North by Northwest' the best movie in the long list of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, but it is definitely his most entertaining one. Escapist and unrealistic, sure, but all the characters, their motivations, actions and events depicted on the screen are believable in their own universe that Hitchcock directed based on Ernest Lehman's screenplay. The dialogue is witty and filled with amusing innuendos, and although it might seem that it is all game for the characters, the imminent threat is always present, and doesn't give the viewer (or the characters) too much time to rest from head spinning action. One aspect that is truly amazing (especially for a film like this) is that none of the characters were irritating, especially those who were totally ignorant for the obvious - the police officers and main character's mother (Jessie Royce Landis - what a wonderful performance), who didn't take seriously one single word that Roger Thornhill said about his situation.Cary Grant, who mostly played himself in his later movies (he did that wonderfully, I might add), gives one of his best performances as Roger Thornhill, a man who is mistaken as government agent and later falsely accused of crime he didn't commit. Eva Marie Saint equally shines as Eve Kendall, a woman whose intentions are unclear. Chemistry between the two leads make the screen sizzle (take that implication how you want) and it is pure enjoyment to watch these two playfully overcome all threats and obstacles. James Mason is perfectly intelligent as the lead villain and Martin Landau as his cruel and cold right hand.Not many movies can be so easy going and edge on your seat entertainment at the same time, and with such perfection. Timeless classic that has aged graciously without any wrinkles.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mr. Thornhill's Thorny Ordeal,"Wedged between the making of two very serious, psychological suspense films, ""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho"", director Alfred Hitchcock created a very different kind of thriller, one consisting largely of comedy, both subtle and obvious, thanks in part to the talent of scriptwriter, Ernest Lehman. Hitchcock and Lehman started with three seemingly unrelated ideas, (1) a mistaken identity, (2) a chase scene through the United Nations, and (3) a spectacular finale at Mount Rushmore. They then wove these three events into one cohesive story, a fascinating creative process by itself.As to the acting, I have seen Cary Grant in many movies, including a number of mediocre items and even worse than that, but he provides the perfect Roger Thornhill with his dry, natural wit and suave, elegant appearance. Whenever I am faced with life's adversities, I only need to recall how Roger would approach the situation with his coolness and muted sense of humor. The fact that Grant did not understand Lehman's script only authenticates his genuine state of confusion as he is pursued from New York City to Rapid City, South Dakota by way of Chicago and some very dry Indiana cornfields. As the mysterious Eve Kendall, Eva Marie Saint is a very different woman indeed from her Oscar winning performance as Edie Doyle in ""On the Waterfront"", and she never ceases to intrigue us as a woman who is far more independent and sexually assertive than we would normally expect in 1959. And who could deliver those caustic, cynical lines as well as James Mason in the part of the deceptively ""respectable"" villain, Philip van Damm? Grant and Mason are an outstanding match, and they bring this film to a high level (no pun intended when you consider the ending) that it may not have achieved without their dynamic interaction.Throughout the film, subtle undercurrents flow beneath the surface, including Thornhill's curious relationship with his undermining mother (Jesse Royce Landis), which may by itself explain his previous two divorces. Then there is the quirky jealousy of van Damm's assistant thug, Leonard (Martin Landau). When I first viewed this film at the innocent age of ten, I didn't appreciate the symbolism of the speeding train through the tunnel at the end, but I was nevertheless very impressed by the overall visual power created by Hitchcock, not only here but in many of his other productions as well.There were many memorable cinematic moments in this film, including an extraordinary aerial shot of Thornhill escaping from the United Nations building, a sudden showdown involving a man, a speeding oil tanker, and a menacing crop duster, and several, breathtaking shots from atop Mount Rushmore, both real and manufactured. As was the case with the Statue of Liberty in ""Saboteur"", the power of the monument is enhanced even more by the director's dramatic camera angles as it stands as an invincible symbol of the freedom that the evil elements in the film want to destroy.The success of ""North By Northwest"" is shaped by a combination of winning attributes, including a very gifted director, a sharp, snappy screenplay by Lehman, superb cinematography by Robert Burks, an effectively moody musical score by Bernard Hermann, and some first-rate acting.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock keeps popping out the classics...,"When you thought that he's all out of ideas and last minute rescues, Hitchcock comes back with more eye candy and great action. North by Northwest is sometimes called Hitchcock's last great film. Carey Grant and Eva Marie Saint have very good chemistry and the inclusion of not one, not two, not three, but severa plot twists makes this film one of Hitchcock's best.One thing not focused on in this film is the use of camera angles. When Roger is taken to make the telegram, the camera slides from a foreground view of Roger's lunch buddies, to the two standing men in a background view. Also, when Roger awaits George Kaplan in the field, there is a great establishing shot of Roger where there is total silence and calm until the eerie plane is spotted. One last camera technique that Hitchcock perfected was when, in the final moments of the Mount Rushmore chase, Roger Thornhill and Eve Kendall were saved by the sniper. The body of the person shot was shown and then a tilt up to the sniper showed the detectives. Little snipets like these were just a few things Hitchcock did well.Overall, this movie was one of the best I've seen ever. For a 1950s movie, it is ahead of it's time and paved the way for future films to imitate many of the innovations that the flick brought to the screen.

Hitchcock once again,"Cary Grant was certainly an excellent actor, he was able to lead some thrillers without loosing his acting humor, and ""North by Northwest"" is an example. Interesting that the film starts with the presence of the director Hitchcock in its first scene. Then Cary Grant became for unknown reasons a man (spy) called Kaplan, he was kidnapped at the restaurant and brought to a big house where the punishment was to get him drunk with whiskey and then left driving a car in the evening. I have no intention to give the whole story of the plot, but you may guess that after these first scenes the rest was very much complicated and if you leave the screen you risk to loose the coherence of the film and not to understand all tricky reasons given by Hitchcock. Grant had a good partner in then beautiful Eva Marie Saint, and to a lesser extent from experienced James Mason. If you wish to see an interesting film, I advise you to see this one, another Hitchcock's jewel.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Please excuse me while I commit cinematic sacrilege,"As it is clearly demonstrated even in this forum, many, many people love this movie. I just finished viewing it myself for the first time, and frankly, I can't say that I agree. Am I nuts? Maybe. All I know is I'd like to put my two cents in, for what it's worth.For an espionage tale like this, I would have preferred an approach  more based on grim realism. Instead, the narrative seemed a bit too convenient and contrived, as if Old Hitch was trying to make the ends meet at the last minute. Somehow, I never felt the `taut' tension of his other films that I've immensely enjoyed (Dial M for Murder, Rear Window, Psycho, The Wrong Man, Vertigo, to name but a few). It certainly doesn't help that the film contains too many scenes that verge on the `fantastical' level. For example, there's a scene in which a gun goes off in the living room of a house. Eva Marie Saint comes out of her room and asks, `What was that noise,' to which James Mason replies, `We were just wondering about that.' Martin Landau just gives a little shrug and all is forgotten. I mean, come on! I'd say it's pretty hard to mistake a gunshot for, say, somebody dropping a glass on the floor. As I mentioned, there are many more scenes like this during the course of the movie, and every single one of them acts as a decelerator' of the narrative. Also, the overall performance of the cast struck me as rather underwhelming, especially when we're talking about some of the finest actors ever to grace the silver screen. James Mason, in particular, sleepwalks his way through, though I can't blame him, given the fact that his character was so painfully underwritten. The bit when Cary Grant acts like he's drunk was pretty difficult to sit through. Humor is fine when it works on, again, a believable level.I like the idea of having a normal Joe get tangled up in a case of mistaken identity/international espionage. Also, it does feature some memorable scenes, especially the famous crop field/airplane sequence (it really does deserve all the praise it has received) But again, it just proves to me that even a seemingly sure-fire combo like Ernest Lehman-Alfred Hitchcock can still come up short on the goods.The second 007 adventure, `From Russia with Love', received some hounding because people thought it was basically a rip-off of this movie (there are some obvious similarities), but in this madman's humble opinion, `From Russia with Love' is the one that achieves a better telling of a spy story.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Wonderful comedy thriller, not Hitchcock's best but his most sheerly enjoyable","North By Northwest is not an artistic masterpiece like Rear Window and Vertigo, but it is probably the most purely entertaining picture Hitchcock ever made. It's essentially a rehash of many of his earlier films, with a plot partially derived from The Thirty Nine Steps and the very similar Saboteur, while there are borrowings from Foreign Correspondent and Notorious, among others. However, it is all done with such style and confidence that it doesn't matter if it's essentially just a greatest hits package.Very few other films of this kind attain the near perfect tone of this one, precariously balanced between seriousness and silliness. Sometimes this film manages the very difficult trick of being both suspenseful and comical at the same time, as in the auction house scene, or the wonderful scene in the lift when the hero's mother turns to two heavies in a lift looking menacingly at the hero and says ""you gentlemen are not REALLY trying to kill my son, are you?"".Of course the famous crop dusting plane scene and the Mount Rushmore chase are terrific. The former is really more notable for the amount of time taken to build up to the action than the action itself, while the technical work on the latter still looks pretty good. In a totally different vein is the astonishingly frank seduction sequence on the train. Hitchcock takes his time here as with many of the other scenes, but the film is so crammed with memorable passages that one hardly notices it's 136 mins long.Ernest Lehman's script is full of wonderful lines, many of them delivered so well by chief villain James Mason that at times we almost want to root for him. ""Has any one ever told you tend to overplay your various roles Mr Kaplan....it seems to me you fellows could stand a little less training from the FBI and a little more from the Actor's Studio"". Cary Grant is so smooth one almost forgets he's over 50, and of course there's also Bernard Herrmann's vibrant score.Endlessly enjoyable even with repeated viewings.

"""I don't like the way Teddy Roosevelt's looking at me.""","Top entertainment from the Master of Suspense, ""North by Northwest"" is one of Hitchs' finest thrillers. Cary Grant, in his final collaboration with Hitch, is aces as a Madison Avenue adman who, by sheer chance, is mistaken as a spy by nefarious types including a debonair James Mason and a creepy Martin Landau. He's also framed for murder, and therefore pursued by the cops, while trying to locate the elusive ""George Kaplan"" who can supposedly help extricate him from the mess. Grant also finds the time to fall in love with a classic elegant blonde Hitchcock leading lady in the form of Eva Marie Saint.Hitch was truly firing on all cylinders here. Assisted by another great score by Bernard Herrmann, his picture begins with typically stylish Saul Bass opening credits. The enticing script is by Ernest Lehman, and for once, it's the kind of scenario where things add up by the time the story finishes. Hitch wastes no time getting the story underway, with a standard little cameo by himself after the opening credits have concluded.Even at two hours and 17 minutes, ""North by Northwest"" never feels as long as it is, due to masterful filmmaking and that twist-laden story. It has the appeal of a scenario wherein an ordinary type of guy ends up way over his head in intrigue. Grant is often scrambling for his life, whether he's pursued by a plane ""crop dusting"", or hanging on by his fingernails from the faces of Mount Rushmore (two very iconic sequences).The cast is wonderful all the way down the line: Mason, Landau, Jessie Royce Landis (playing Grants' mother, despite being just a few years older than him), Leo G. Carroll, Adam Williams, Robert Ellenstein, Edward Platt, Edward Binns, etc. That great English character actor Carroll is a delight as the savvy ""Professor"" who will ultimately have to give Grant some pretty potent exposition. Grant is lots of fun, and Lehman gives him some pretty funny dialogue to savour.

Don't Miss the Bus,"North By Northwest is classic Hitchcock and is a moive not to be missed.There are only a few minor mishaps--> I rank the movie a little lower than perhaps it deserves because the video version has some faded colors.  This may be fixed if re-released in a remastered version.  However, it may also be due to film deterioration (as color movies shot on one real of Kodak) rather than 3, fade over time).The other minor goofs are caused my the time period of the 1959 and the recent jumps is special effects technology.  The actors over blue screens are very obvious in parts.This mistakes cause this not to be a perfect movie, but it is still a classic.  There is great acting and a great story.  You should be engaged and intrigued, and always surprised and what will occur next.  It is also very non-predictable as nobody is safe at anytime, so basically anything can occur in the story.At the same time, the story flows easilly and logically from place to place. (unlike Hitchcock's earlier ""Secret Agent"" were locations are not fully explained, North by Northwest fully utilizes the locations and uses them to add to the story).Other little idosyncronsies further add to the story as art, airlines, the UN, Mt. Rushmore (plus the fact that 100 pines were planted on an MGM sound-lot to make it look like the surrounding ""Rushmore"" woods), and a reference to Shakespeare (the title) all add to the story.Originally known as ""The Man in Lincoln's Nose"", North By Northwest will not disappoint.However, don't miss the bus as Hitchcock makes his appearance before the appearance of Grant, whom the role was written for and whom shows valid reasons for why the James Bond producers wanting him for the James Bond role. (he did not get that role because he would only do 2 or 3 bond movies)Rating: 8Viewed: on tape",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great script and Hitchcock's genius direction makes this film interesting even today,"Today, when technology is getting advanced by every new day, movie scenes like the one on Mount Rushmore in ""North by Northwest"" looks very funny, but I must admit that this movie is great even from todays perception. One of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies has his favorite actor Cary Grant in it, blonde girl Eva Marie Saint and excellent actors like James Mason & Martin Landau. So to say long story short; I enjoyed in this movie and I'm 'only' 19 years old (this movie was made almost 50 years ago!!!). Why? Because of great scenes coming from genius Alfred Hitchcock, brilliant script that makes this movie a great thriller, with twists, good performances and some comedic parts (coming from Cary Grant and Jessie Royce Landis). So if you have opportunity, watch this movie cause it's a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best Hitchcock Movie,"If anyone has doubts about the power of mistaken identity and its place in fiction, look no further than this film. The many hokey takes on it through the years have diminished its very real power as a storytelling device. As a comedy trick, it is cheap and dull. But as a dramatic trick... there is real force behind it. Everyone dreads being alone in the time of a crisis and not having anyone believe them and feeling like they are sinking further and further into a pit that's growing ever deeper and deeper. A good filmmaker can use the idea of mistaken identity in a tense situation to tackle these fears. And Hitchcock most certainly is a few steps above a good filmmaker.In fact, he is at his best here. Vertigo may be his best shot film from an artistic point of view. Rear Window (which I would have done a review of for this series of critical takes if I had seen it in time and is quite excellent) is his most interestingly shot movie perspective-wise. But this is Hitchcock showing his truest colors. All the tropes of his directorial style are on full display and are in fine shape. I often joke to myself (I'm alone a lot) about Hitchcock's love of his use of his specific style dashboard cam no matter the situation, but it can be an effective cinematic tool to increase tension, make the area feel more claustrophobic, and increase focus on the characters.To give a one-sentence synopsis: An advertising executive is mistaken for a secret agent from the authorities and must go on the run. What follows is a wild yet deft 136 minutes of what I believe to be Hitchcock's most obviously entertaining film. Pulses pound as the characters move like chess pieces around a well-written, twisting and turning storyline that causes many iconic scenes, the most famous of which being when Thornhill (The protagonist) runs from a crop duster craft. It is everything an action scenes should be, and the isolation kicks every element up a few notches. It is the favorite scene of many, including me.Every element, from the action to the mystery, is well-executed. The dialogue is interesting, as it is in many Hitchcock movies. In fact, one of Hitchcock's most underrated talents is writing-dialogue. He may not be a Sorkin or a Woody Allen, but he knows that dialogue is the key to making interesting characters that are more than just pieces in a puzzle. He may have believed that actors are cattle, but one can tell from watching his films that he knows the importance of characters. His dialogue is natural yet profound, and while depicting catch phrases and fads from that era would make the movies seem dated, the intelligent, understated way he talks about the issues of his time here and there make the movies seem like they are proudly representing their time. The difference is the difference between decay and grandeur, between the many ephemeral leaders of Rome and the never-fading Roman culture.The acting is more than fine. Cary Grant, one of the legends, puts on a believable and thorough performance. In some of the quieter scenes, it is what makes the film work. Eva Marie Saint, another legend (and a blonde, as most women are in Hitchcock movies) adds spice and edge to a role that would have been ordinary had it been performed by a less actress.On a side note, I don't think I'm the only one who finds it just a bit creepy to watch someone act on the screen when they're now dead, like Grant, and even more bizarre when they're still alive but have aged quite a bit since their role, like Ms. Saint, who is alive and in her nineties at the time of this review.Hitchcock is known as the Mater of Suspense and this film shows you why; it takes all sorts of twists and turns. One of the trademarks of Hitchcock films is their ability to appear like they're one type of film before seamlessly yet starkly transitioning to another. The Birds went from a screwball Pythonesque comedy to a horror film, Psycho from a heist film to a dark twisted thriller. I have seen no other director that can pull off this trick so well. In this film, we go from a more mysterious psychological movie to more of an espionage adventure tale; it's not as jarring of a shift, but it is a shift nonetheless.The score represents Hitchcock's best on that front. Scores like this are the reason why an unscored movie like The Birds or a softly scored flick like Rear Window come as such a shock. This score is big and booming and dynamic. Yes, the fifties were riddled with over the top scores (it's actually one of the best ways to identify a film as being from that decade) but Hitchcock knows how to use it in a way that cuts the through the inherent cheesiness of the idea (though I still can't stifle a chuckle every time it gets real intense) and turn it into an impressive cinematic tool the underscore the many important moments of the film. Give the soundtrack a listen; it is perhaps even more impressive when give a listen away from the film.If I was given one word and only one word to describe this movie, I would choose iconic. This is the sort of movie that deserves to be watched, to be passed down from generation to generation and held up as one of the hallmarks of great cinema. Watch and take in what has been honored for generations and has, like landmarks of many other sorts, affected the lives of many, including me, during that time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A Hitchcock classic, but not among his best","`North by Northwest', written by Ernest Lehman and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, stars Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who finds himself embroiled in a particularly nasty case of mistaken identity. He finds himself being mistaken for a gentleman who is wrapped up in some dirty dealings with Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), his henchman Leonard (Martin Landau) and various other unsavory thugs under Vandamm's employ.  He also meets up with Hitchcock's requisite blonde femme fatale, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) and surrounded by this cast of characters makes a cross-country adventure where his life is threatened several times; all the while with Thornhill having to depend on his wits to keep him alive.While `North by Northwest' is a good film, I don't consider it to be one of his best, which, at least in my small circle of rabid film friends/relatives, is fairly sacrilegious.  I enjoy the vibrancy of the script and the lush cinematography, but there are a couple of things that cause the film to fall short of excellence on my personal Hitchcock scale. Mainly, there's the matter of James Mason as the villain.  Mason is a great actor, and has been in some really good films, so his talents were wasted as the tepid Vandamm.  There simply really wasn't a part for him in the film; rather, most of the relatively `juicy' bits were relegated to Martin Landau. It seemed that the concentration was solely on Grant's character, which in most cases is adequate, but in a suspense film, I personally like to see the villain have a more pervasive presence.Of course, there are some masterful elements to this film.  The infamous cornfield scene is truly masterful.  It isn't even the shot of the crop duster chasing down Grant  the image that gets me every time is the very quick shot of Grant standing across the dusty road from the gentleman waiting for the bus.  As he is sizing him up, trying to figure out if he is the man that he has traveled a long distance to see, Hitchcock frames the shot much like a classic western.  There are many shots like this that, if frozen, would make a compelling photograph.  I can also acknowledge, while I am not as much a fan of Hitchcock's comedic moments as I am of the more dark or horrifying ones, that the comic timing with which Grant delivers his lines is excellent.  His charisma certainly adds a spark to the film, and there are times when he is so smooth that even if something was completely unbelievable I had to laugh and say, `Hey, it's Cary Grant  what do you expect?'`North by Northwest' was made in 1959 and is more akin to the whimsical and much-eschewed `The Trouble with Harry' than his more story-driven films of the 1940's and his horrifying masterpiece a year later, 1960's, `Psycho'. While I acknowledge that `North by Northwest' is a good film, it doesn't even make my personal `Hitchcock Top Ten' on which his darker films dwell. However, it's kind of the way I feel about the Coen Brothers  even a simply `good' film of theirs is usually much better than the average film, so a slightly above-average Hitchcock film like `North by Northwest' garners at least three stars from me.--Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fine set pieces, but little sense of pacing or structure","The opening sequences are superb, but, for me, it all goes wrong after the scene in the UN lobby. Just when Hitch should have been tightening the screw, he inserts a scene where a committee of FBI agents reveal to us that they know our hero (Cary Grant) to be innocent. This robs much of what follows of any real tension. Just when the pace should be hotting up, Hitchcock slows things down with that long sequence on the train, which, surprisingly, lacks any sense of danger. As so often with Hitchcock in the 50s, he seemed more interested in glamour than with anything else. And glamour doesn't mix very easily with menace.The famous scene where Cary Grant is attacked by a plane is fine, but it isn't integrated with the rest of the plot. (If someone wanted to kill Cary Grant, why didn't they just hire a gunman instead of a plane?) The plotline is perfunctory: Cary Grant makes his way into the villain's house, and instantly discovers what one of the best FBI agents has failed to uncover in years. The scene at the auction and the final chase on Mount Rushmore are, once again, memorable. But overall, this film appears to confirm my view that while Hitchcock was superb with individual set pieces, he never gave much thought to the overall structure or pacing. Even at his best (e.g. ""The 39 Steps"" or ""Rear Window"") Hitchcock doesn't give an impression of having an artistic vision to impart, which makes his reputation as a great director rather puzzling. No doubt his admirers see more than I do.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Classic thriller - I love it!,"Roger Thornhill is an advertising man.  However when he is kidnapped it is clear that he has been mistaken for someone else.  When he tries to find out what's going he is framed for murder and sets out on a cross country run to survive.  Along the way he meets danger, adventure and beauty in the shape of the mysterious Eve Kendall.  However when he finds the truth he is drawn towards a final showdown with the dangerous Vandamm.Rightly regarded as a classic and can more than compete with today's thrillers that too often rely on special effects to make up for the lack of genuine suspense.  Here the plot requires a great deal of faith, but it is brought off with such style and energy that it is totally absorbing.  The action is great and the several main scenes have become part of popular culture and are regularly spoofed on TV etc.  The romance works as well and Thornhill and Kendall exchange plenty of good scenes.The dialogue is great and the direction is faultless from Hitchcock.  Many thrillers run over 2 hours - but only the good ones can stand up to repeated viewings.  Northwest can take back to back viewings it is so good.  The plot may have been put together as shooting went (as was the case with at leastone key scene) but it all stands together well.  The acting is also perfect, Grant's rebirth as a thriller man is brilliant and is one of Hitchcock's best everyman characters.  Marie-Saint is yet another dangerous blonde but is very good. James `The Voice' Mason is excellent, while Landau adds great homosexual subtext to his character.  The ever present Leo G Carroll IS Mr Waverly but is still enjoyable and even support roles like Landis as Thornhill's mother is perfection!Over 40 years on this film has barely dated. Hearing the music is enough to make me want to see it again, while the direction, set pieces, dialogue and performances are all pitch perfect.  A wonderful thriller for young and old - no sex, no swearing, all thrills.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Wow, one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen","I bought this on a whim, after someone made a joke about a drawing I'd done (of a man running away from something in a field) striking of Hitchcocks famous scene. After watching it, I am ashamed that I didn't see this instant classic sooner.The film starts off and instantly you are hooked, the snappy dialogue (the brilliant Taxi skit), the comedy (pretty much any scene with Mrs Thornhill Sr) and the thrilling ambiguity and intrigue. The answers come in just the right places, so you're never wondering longer than is reasonable, apart from the scenes where Hitchcock has dragged it out to an amazing edge-of-seat effect.Another thing I loved, apart from the great writing, story and direction, were the characters, a compound of the above three. All the actors do a brilliant job of filling the characters shoes, and Cary Grant is nothing short of irresistibly charming and brash as the troubled hero. Most film-makers nowadays would portray the characters as psychological train wrecks given their circumstance, but they exhibit the cool and likable persona's (even Mr Van Damme is a charming villain) that are sadly missed in most modern films.In fact, a lot of things in this film are sadly missed from modern thrillers, the charm is irresistibly and I've no qualms about giving it a 10 and saying it's one of the coolest films I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the best good movies I've watched in a while,"Personal Rating: 7.5/10This movie is a fantastic good movie. Will it leave you thinking about it days on end, no. But my goodness will you enjoy the time your butt is in your seat watching this film.If Hitchcock can be used as an adjective I'd describe North by Northwest as one of the most Hitchcocky films he made. The imagination and talent behind each shot is suburb. This movie was shot during the wild west of movie making and Hitchcock used the camera in many outstanding and creative ways during this film.Cary Grant, my goodness, I couldn't tell if I was watching acting or if that was just him. Grant truly embodied his character and had fun with it, pulling the audience further into the compelling plot.Talking about the plot, this movie tells a story where if I was to describe any bit of it, it would spoil everything. So I'll just say that it felt fresh, new, and exciting. Even 60 years after this movie was released.Now my beef. The female protagonist isn't introduced until almost an hour into the movie. It felt as if this film had been holding in all the romantic commentary and substance-less conversation and just exploded as soon as the female character was introduced. Though a lot of it plays into the plot, boy was much unnecessary and dragged on for an eternity. Adding to the already too long run time of 136 minutes.Overall, a fantastic movie that keeps you quite engaged throughout the run-time. Cary Grant and Eva Saint playing their characters very nicely, and Alfred Hitchcock pulling out all the stops.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Grant + Hitchcock = Fun,"Cary Grant never ceases to amaze me. Though I haven't seen a whole list of his movies (Only two: This and Charade), his wit and cool demeanor makes me realize that if I was a movie go-er in his time I'd pick him as the person I'd want to be like when I grew up. The movie's only downfall was that it seemed kind of on the long side, and once or twice I caught myself closing my eyes about 15 minutes from the end, but Grant's ability to keep me interested in this movie surpasses the idea that this was even a Hitchcock film. By the middle I'd completely forgotten, because the style seemed so different from all of Hitchcock's previous films I've seen (Psycho, Rope, Vertigo, et-al), and I was happy with the end result. A must see for fans of Bond movies, because this is the completely implausible way of telling the same kind of story.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Personal Favourite,"North by Northwest is a personal favourite of mine. It is Hitchcock's most light and purely entertaining film, a smart change of pace after the darkly psychological 'Vertigo'. It takes his signature wrong man storyline and simply sees how much fun it can have with the idea. It makes the characters as charming as possible, the action grander than ever before, the locations exotic and the situations as exciting as you could want them to be. It's a film that succeeds in its aim magnificently, give the audience a thrilling adventure.It revolves around suave advertising executive Roger Thornhill who is kidnapped after being mistaken for 'George Kaplan' and interrogated before almost being killed by the shady Vandamm. Nobody believes Thornhill's story so he sets out to find Kaplan himself. However he has to go on the run when he's framed for murder, which draws him into a world of deceit, spies and simply trying to stay alive. This story is not only brilliantly entertaining, but it twists and turns all the time. You don't know who Thornhill can trust or what's waiting around the corner for him, making him a vulnerable hero. A good example being when he meets Eve Kendell, we don't know whether she's a kind stranger, a spy herself or working with the enemy. It is great at keeping you guessing like that.What always impresses me about the film is how it blends genres so easily. It is a thrilling adventure at heart of course. Yet there are smatterings of mystery, action, romance and comedy throughout. It leaps between all of these without any feeling out of place and without losing sight of the plot. Most of the characters actions drive the narrative forward in that sense, what we initially think is only loosely connected may end having a larger bearing. Almost everything that happens on screen has leads to something else. In fact the humour in the film is something that really stands out. The situations are dangerous yet they can also be wonderfully absurd and the film finds genuine laughs with the idea of a normal person being forced to risk his life in such a way.The performances are great all round. Cary Grant is delivers one of the most stylish performances of all time as Thornhill. He makes the character so debonair and charming, seemingly unfazed by the deadly situations he finds himself in, with a sharp wit and wisecracks at the ready. He's clearly enjoying himself and is a magnetic screen presence. Eva Marie Saint is effortlessly appealing as Kendell, probably the most humane of Hitchcock's icy blondes. James Mason is just wonderful as Vandamm. He's the perfect villain. Subtle, mysterious, cunning, strangely charismatic, all with a smooth voice and expressive features. The notable supporting performances come from Martin Landau as creepy heavy Leonard and Jessie Royce Landis as Thornhill's sardonic mother.The film is filled with memorable sequences and imagery. The romantic playfulness of the scenes aboard the train. The brilliant scene where Thornhill deliberately sabotages an auction. The truly spectacular climax that takes place atop Mount Rushmore. One of my favourite sequences in all of film is when Thornhill waits for 'Kaplan' on a stretch of road in the middle of nowhere. The way Hitchcock manages to build a sense of tension and isolation is simply masterfully. It also leads to the noteworthy crop duster sequence. This is how you do action. It might not seem like much, but we really do feel as if Thornhill's life is at risk and that gives it so much more impact than any fancy effects or choreography could.Hitchcock's direction is as good as ever. The camera-work is very fluid here, it moves gently around the screen at times, almost as if it's surveying the area. His staging of the action sequences and moments of important dialogue help immensely in giving the scenes the weight they need. This is also a handsome looking film. Everything from The hotel interiors to the train carriages to the UN building looks fantastic and is lit well. Ernest Lehman wrote the screenplay and it is a brilliant one, full of witty dialogue that roles off the tongue exquisitely. Apparently he was attempting to write the ultimate Hitchcock thriller, I think it's fair to say that he succeeded in doing so. Bernard Herrmann's dynamic score, and its wonderful main theme, is just the icing on the cake.In many ways North by Northwest is like the prototype Bond film, except it's unrestrained by any formula and contains Hitchcock's trademark thrills. We have a dashing main character, the beautiful female for him to latch on to, a diabolical but charming villain, a surging plot and visually interesting locations. Of course the difference maker is Hitchcock himself. He has a plot and script that allow him to do what he does best to the most unrestricted level he's ever done. The thrills, the suspense, the action, the excitement, not to mention the subtle comedy and romance. It's all here and it's even grander than before. This is Hitchcock's exercise in escapist fun. It gives us pure thrills without any pretensions and I wouldn't change a thing about it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

There is a lot more romance and talking than chasing bad guys.Like most films, however, its not without it's good points. Cary Grant is , as usual, quite dashing in the lead role, even though he is obviously aging by this point in time.

duplicity as a game...,"Why can't we do that kind of movie anymore? ... a lot of tension, many humor, a little violence and great but simple story, a recipe we seem to have lost!There is a lot of Vertigo tension and some idea of the futur humoristic ton he will use in Marnie, but there is especially one great couple of actors.

Cary Grant excels as Roger Thornhill and Eva Marie Saint is ravishing as the romantic interest. Originally written with Grace Kelly in mind, Alfred Hitchcock is at the top of his game from planting a McGuffin (a device in a movie to serve as the catalyst for the plot) to the side winding twists and turns that keeps the audience guessing and on the edge of their seat.
The visuals are equally as impressive from the crop dusting plane chasing Grant or the ending leading us on top of Mount Rushmore.

Another Hitchcock's Masterpiece,"In a business lunch in a hotel in New York, the advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) is wrongly identified as being the American spy George Kaplan by the foreigners' agents Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) and his right arm Leonard (Martin Landau). Roger is kidnapped and Vandamm's men try to simulate an accident for killing him. Roger escapes, but soon is accused of murdering a diplomat in the UN building. With the police and the foreigners' spies chasing him, Roger meets and has a crush on Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). Later, he will be advised that George Kaplan indeed does not exist, and he agrees to act like a bait to rescue Eve from Phillip and his men.This movie is another masterpiece by Alfred Hitchcock. The story, full of comedy, action, thriller and romance, is delightful. Cary Grant is amazing in the role of Roger Thornhill and Eva Marie Saint is extremely beautiful and sexy.

More Hits than Misses,"North by Northwest is a highly touted Alfred Hitchcock film.  Ranked among his classics such as Vertigo, Rear Window, and Notorious, N.b.N. is generally thought of as one of the suspense master's all-time greats.  It is an overall appealing film but is not on the same level as the aforementioned flicks.  There are terrific moments, but the film doesn't come together as well as these other Hitchcock thrillers.  The ending is not quite up to par, either.The movie deals with Roger Thornhill(Cary Grant) as a cool, witty advertising executive in Manhattan.  He is wrongly identified as an agent for the government by a crime organization.  He is setup and narrowly escapes his first brush with danger.  The police do not believe his story, and everyone, including Thornhill's own mother, thinks he is out of his mind.  From here, Grant goes on a wild ride to clear his name and find out what the hell is going on.This ride involves planes, trains and automobiles and he meets up with Eve Kendall(Eva Marie Saint) who is very forward with him, and we can tell right away that she's up to something.  Their conversation reminded me of a conversation Frank Sinatra has with Janet Leigh in The Manchurian Candidate. Unlike the latter, which can be seen as having several different meanings and subliminal messages, Grant and Saint have chemistry in their teasing, but it stays rather one dimensional and more formulaic.Scenes like the one where Grant intentionally gets arrested at an auction to escape a couple henchmen are comical and clever.  Even now with computers and high-tech special affect the cropduster and Mt. Rushmore scenes are exhilarating, to say the least.  The cinematography is wonderful throughout the picture, and except for the 50's automobiles and attire, looks remarkably fresh and modern.While Vertigo's ending was one of the most shocking, Rear Window's the most suspenseful, and Notorious' perfectly fitting, N.b.N.'s didn't thrill me quite the same.  Perhaps I am being overly critical because of my expectations.  The three Hitchcock movies I've compared to North by Northwest are all 10's in my book, while this one gets an 8.  I enjoyed watching it and recommend it to anyone, especially suspense/thriller or Hitchcock fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Far-fetched action-packed Hitchcock starring Cary Grant,"The main criticism one could have for this film is that in the midst of such action and secretive James Bond like intrigues, the viewer may very well at some point feel like the protagonist is just too naive and his adventures seem a bit too unlikely in that particular succession of events. The point of the film was obviously non-stop action, a genuine sense of entertainment throughout, and for the time very impressive visuals, as the ending scene is an absolute token of; and while the dialog is very good and in parts superb, and there is enough to keep the viewer's attention with the various characters, the stakes, the mystery, the action and very good performances given by Grant, Mason, Saint... the film still feels a bit 'far-fetched', like it really wants to go somewhere and stops at nothing to, even if it may've benefited from strengthening the 'how' to get there. Overall the plot is quite clever, and again it's very well executed and a fun ride, but it's fairly long and perhaps counts on the candor of its protagonist a bit too much, and slightly on the overcomplicated side of the action-crime spectrum.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A contrived and unbelievable piece of swill that somehow became a classic.,"Now, I like Alfred Hitchcock as much as the next fellow but I can't for the life of me, figure out why this is such a tremendous success and so highly rated. This movie does not make a lick of sense and every bit is so contrived and unrealistic that I was constantly taken out of the film. For example, Cary Grant is in the middle of a dirt road near some crops when out of nowhere a crop duster appears and tries to fly over him and kill him. This is a classic scene but makes little to no sense. Wouldn't it have been easier to run him over with a car or something?Another scene where he meets the heroin is simply laughable. The dialogue is corny (""whenever I meet a beautiful women, I must tell her I want to make love to her"" PLEASE!) and the plot twists are nothing short of offensively stupid. The movie has great sets, like the Mount Rushmore set, but seriously, if a professional knife thrower has a knife, why would he jump at you? Especially on a steep mountain.This movie is contrived and laughable the whole way through, the problem is that its a drama, not a campy 60's batman show. I wish I could be clever with this review but it seems unfair that I should have to put in effort to be clever when its obvious Alfred Hitchcock didn't put in effort to make a decent film.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Paging Mr Kaplan!""","After a couple of financial disappointments Hitchcock triumphantly bounced back with which if not his greatest film film is certainly the most entertaining, and marks the apogee of a series of chase thrillers dating back at least to 'The 39 Steps', and also marks the culmination of The Master's journey from Britain to the United States and from black & white to Vistavision and Technicolor. That it didn't collect a single Oscar the year 'Ben-Her' won thirteen is yet another reason it's impossible to take the Oscars seriously.In an immaculate cast James Mason shines in what is effectively the first of his later career dominating the supporting cast, while Leo G.

Spectacular!,"Just like ""Citizen Kane"", it's not exactly THE best movie ever made but still a very revolutionary and important one and above all, a real classic!I think that ""North by Northwest"" can be compared to an early James Bond movie and can be regarded as one of the most early 'modern' action movie. Some sequences are really spectacular and are shot and edited in the same way as most action movies are these days. Of course the crop duster sequence is a classic but I like the spectacular finale on Mt. Rushmore even better.The music by Bernard Hermann, is just as Hitchcock's directing ahead of its time. There also is some lovely cinematography by yet again Robert Burks.The story is really exciting and it has all the elements that makes a movie a spectacular adventure to watch. Is there anything wrong with this movie? In my opinion not. The movie certainly isn't the most exciting or thrilling Hitchcock movie but it might very well be the most entertaining one also thanks to some well scripted humor.Also look out for a young Martin Landau as the henchman Leonard.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"The best of Hitchcock's ""conventional"" thrillers","I always say Hitchcock mostly made two different kinds of films. Hitchcock had masterpieces of horror and suspense (Psycho, Rear Window, etc.), but he also had a run of more conventional thrillers with less artistic suspense and ""big swings"" in unique directions. Torn Curtain, The Man Who Knew Too Much, etc. Of these, I believe North by Northwest is the best of the bunch.While a more conventionally told, presented, and depicted story -- linear, conventional love interest, conventional twists and turns in just the right places, big location shifts, and tentpole scenes, etc. -- this is just a cracking thriller up there with the best of the breed in any era. It's marvelously cast and acted, and a truly fun watch. There's a reason it's so beloved, and it's all on display here, as is the obvious influence it had on later films, similarly beloved.I like the lightness in the film, most of all. It adds something tonally you don't always get (even in similar Hitchcock films like The Man Who Knew Too Much). For this I credit Cary Grant, who brings all of his charm and then some, and knows exactly how to deploy it for this story.Martin Landau and Hitchcock's decision to play that character as gay and in love with his partner has very little effect on story, but adds another layer that is just exceptional in the film, that makes the world feel real. Kudos for that decision, as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I don't get it.,"I simply don't. Perhaps someone will explain to me how did this film get to #20 in the top 250 films list, because I can't see why. I'm not complaining that the film is dated (1959 ... nope, no problems with that) or that the film is full of plotholes (only a newspaper film critic will complain about that), but I can't see how the film is interesting. I take it that Cary Grant is playing an unrealistic character, someone who's ordinary but thrown into extraordinary situations, but still doesn't flinch when a crop-duster comes after him or when he's escorted out by strangers with guns. Fine - but where's the charm? Where's the suaveness? Where's the style? I don't feel it. In fact, it came across as VERY fake. I don't see Roger Thornhill - all I see is Cary Grant. I can't understand why the cropduster scene is so memorable - is it because it's the first time there was a movie with a man being chased by a plane in it? I take it that the Mt Rushmore scene is memorable because it's the first time it's been done and no other film has really gone to do it again, but didn't think that was outrageously original (not saying it's not a creative idea, just don't get the hype). Eva Marie Saint is pretty and plays the complicated Eve subtly well. But I don't see Hitchcock's 'master' direction - I can't see what's so unique ... or ... or incredible about it. Can somebody point the way, cause I don't think age has anything to do with this (I'm an 18 year-old movie geek).",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Hitch's better flicks,"Somewhat overblown suspense thriller has exciting plot twists and Cary Grant's unique screen presence to recommend it.  Well directed, tells the story of an advertising man mistaken for a decoy created by the CIA, who is hunted across the nation and ends up falling for the CIA's undercover agent -- Marie-Saint.  The ""Open paranoia"" scene in the cropdusting field is a great sequence.  Here Hitchcock succeeds often in not being obvious, remaining playful, and pleasing the audience a lot.I must respond to the comments I read on here by user ""tedg"" -- I did not find them illuminating.  On the contrary, they seem to be the products of a confused mind, and someone who has not paid much attention to what he's saying before putting it in print.  First of all, as to his complaint about the quality of the sets, they are not as he claims ""junk"" but actually well-made sets.  I'd like to see him, or anybody, given a lot of money create a duplication of the monument in question that would look better -- it just can't be done, because the monument itself is made of stone and took decades and millions of dollars to make.Also, ""tedg"" comments on the character played by Marie-Saint (hardly my favorite actress) -- he notes that she plays a ""prostitute"" who is turned patriotic, but he doesn't seem to have been paying enough attention to the film to notice that in the end it is revealed that she is an undercover CIA agent, and not a prostitute at all.Users like this should definately not turn off their vcrs before the end of a movie if they're going to try to post thoughtful comments on it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock's Most Entertaining Film!,"Over the course of his career, Alfred Hitchcock has made many highly-regarded works and every film of his was treated like an event. After a very successful decade of the 1950's which includes famed works such as Rear Window and Vertigo, Hitchcock closes out the decade with perhaps his greatest work, 1959's North by Northwest. After the dark erotic film that was Vertigo, Hitchcock decided to make something more fun, action/adventure-oriented, and something light-hearted in general. This film is essentially the first James Bond film, even though the first James Bond film would be produced several years later. This is an incredibly tense and suspenseful spy thriller that boasts two of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history-the crop duster scene and the dramatic rescue upon the rocks of Mount Rushmore. This film has lots of incredible talent working on camera and behind the scenes. In addition to Hitchcock, we have great acting from the likes of Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. The film was written by one of the greatest screenwriters of the era, Ernest Lehman. The film has a distinctive look because of Robert Burks's camerawork and texture is given to the sound of the movie because of the eerie score of Bernard Hermann's.This movie is a tense spy thriller, a screwball romantic comedy, and a tale about the Cold War/paranoia/government spying all in one movie. Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a successful Manhattan advertising agent who is abducted by two strange men at the Plaza Hotel. Thornhill is taken to the mansion of a foreign spy Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) where he is believed to be an undercover federal agent named George Kaplan. Thornhill denies it, and he is forced to drink bourbon and to ride in a car down a twisted, winding road. He escapes the planned execution, and the police refuses to believe his story. He eventually gets framed for murder and now is on the run. He takes a cross-country train to make his escape where he runs into the mysterious, cold femme fatale, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). It is unclear at first why she wants to aid him, but we later learn she may be more than meets the eye. From the train, we then head to those famous scenes involving the murderous crop duster airplane in the cornfields of Illinois and the harrowing escape from Mt. Rushmore.The acting is very good, but that really should not be a surprise given the names of the cast. To this point, Cary Grant had a very long career. This might be his best performance. The contributions he added to the film is wonderful. Eva Marie Saint, who made an impression acting opposite of Marlon Brando in 1954's On the Waterfront, adds elegance and class to the role of Eve Kendall. James Mason plays a convincing villain and he does seem like the prototypical James Bond villain. His henchman, Leonard is played by the wonderful Martin Landau. Landau would go on to have a wonderful late-age career, but let's not forget that he was in an Alfred Hitchcock film.There are so many Alfred Hitchcock films to choose from when it comes to naming his best film, but I can say without a doubt that North by Northwest is his most entertaining film. In addition to making the spy genre more accessible to the audience, Hitchcock and Lehman added a little bit of everything. We have quirky and funny dialogue, great action/chase scenes, and some lovely romance. Also, I really need to discuss the crop duster scene. That scene was made so well, and my heart wanted to explode because of how tense that scene was. I felt scared for Cary Grant's character. I am quite amazed at the technical achievement that went to making that scene, and even by today's standards. Are there themes/motifs behind the film? Both Hitchcock and Lehman said no. However, given the time of the film's release, there are some central ideas regarding Cold War paranoia and government spying. If you like James Bond films, you have this movie to thank. Come for the (multiple) twists, stay to see an entertaining spy thriller.My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best directed thrillers of all time,"Roger Thornhill (Grant) is mistaken for another man by a group of foreign spies and after a few unfortunate events, finds himself on the run.North by Northwest is recognized as one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest films and with the adrenaline soaked narrative and a great central performance it is easy to see why.Cary Grant (Charade) delivers a sensational portrayal of advertising executive Roger Thornhill, a simple man who is mistaken for someone else. Thornhill is wonderfully sarcastic, very charismatic and plaudits must go to Grant who has created an original hero, an ordinary man who turns himself into an action hero within a short space of time in Alfred Hitchcock's wonderfully realistic world.Hitchcock's action styled direction is picture perfect for this fast moving thriller. The British director cements the realism down to the ground with his cutting edge close shots and the fast sweeping direction, most noticeable in the landmark plane scene in the fields.It is easy to overdo action in modern day films and Hitchcock has expertly managed to balance the action alongside the everyday events of the protagonists.This film is close to resembling a Bond styled genre, though obviously was made before Bond films were. The cocky yet sophisticated Thornhill is well directed by Hitchcock to create the ultimate action hero in a sharply written narrative that is more realistic and entertaining than the Bond spy genre.The reason this 1959 thriller works is down to all the genres it covers. Through Hitchcock's action and realistic direction, viewers are thrust into action sequences, romantic moments and crime sequences to, providing viewers with the ultimate adventure. Covering different genres is not a stroll in the park as recent films show and can be appreciated here with Hitchcock's wonderful balance.The balance of the action and romantic genres works well with the whole mystery concept of what is happening to the central character.The settings are well executed and further add to the intensity of the plot, particularly the field and the climax on Mount Rushmore.North by Northwest is a top notch action thriller, made so by Hitchcock's direction, great writing and a fine central character.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Terrific Entertainment From the Master,"With everything you expect from Hitchcock and more, ""North By Northwest"" is terrific entertainment from the master.  There are interesting characters, an exciting story with intrigue and suspense, lots of fine photography, and some of Hitchcock's best-known set pieces.  It's capped off by a fine Bernard Herrmann score that is almost as good as the one he wrote later for ""Psycho"".Cary Grant may be the ideal Hitchcock actor, and he is a big part of making this such great fun.  As one of the man-on-the-run characters that Hitchcock loved to make movies about, Grant is entertaining and believable, maintaining good humor even as he tries to work his way out of a series of desperate situations.  The other stars, James Mason and Eva Marie Saint, also are very good, and the supporting roles are all filled by good character actors.The story is one of Hitchcock's most exciting.  It's slightly longer than usual, and it occasionally stretches credibility, but it all goes by quickly because there is always something interesting going on, and there is also plenty to look at.  Whether using the famous landmarks or using more everyday settings, there is always lots of good detail, and the settings complement the story nicely.  At times the plot becomes somewhat fanciful, but probably deliberately so, for it only emphasizes Hitchcock's mastery of technique that he can have his characters do almost anything and make you believe it at the time.With everything that characterizes Hitchcock at his very best, this fully deserves its reputation as one of the finest films by him or any other director.

"""War Is Hell, Even When It's A Cold One.""","Following up on his two previous masterpieces, The Thirty Nine Steps and Saboteur; Alfred Hitchcock put together his ultimate chase film with elements of both coming into Ernest Lehman's screenplay. I've seen figures that show in terms of box office and later video sales and rentals, North By Northwest was Hitchcock's most successful film financially.At this point Alfred Hitchcock's name over the title could sell a movie, but I'm sure he didn't mind having Cary Grant in it to draw the movie going public. This was Cary's fourth and final appearance in a Hitchcock film and I think it is his best performance in one.Like in the two films I cited, Cary is innocently caught up in a web of intrigue and he got there by just answering a telephone page at a hotel dining room. He took a call right after someone paged a George Kaplan and the bad guys think he's Kaplan. And he gets grabbed.It's a devilishly difficult situation for him because there ain't no George Kaplan. He's a fictitious guy who was invented by one of our spy agencies (that's never identified in the story)to take the heat off an agent very close to masterspy James Mason. Mason tries to murder Grant by getting him drunk and putting him behind the wheel of a car. Later on Grant gets framed for murder while trying to find out what's going on and he's on the run from New York to Chicago to Rapid City and the Mount Rushmore monument.James Mason plays the cultured villain Philip Van Dam. Mr. Mason who had some of the most precise diction heard this side of Ronald Colman on screen, could play villain and hero and a lot in between equally well. Among other things he's a bi-sexual and his henchman/boyfriend Martin Landau is jealous of his involvement with Eva Marie Saint. With the Code still firmly in place, it was quite daring for Mason to refer to Landau's suspicions as his 'woman's intuition.Eva Marie Saint joins the list of cool and fiery blonds Hitchcock was so partial to for his films. I'm surprised he never used Eva Marie again, she seemed the perfect successor for Grace Kelly who if she hadn't become a princess would have been playing this part for sure.Bernard Herrman who wrote the acclaimed score for Hitchcock's Vertigo followed that up with an equally good score. Especially during the moments of Grant's tangle with a crop duster plane and the chase across the Mount Rushmore Monument, Herrman made great use of music to help the audience feel the tension. It's a great instrumental piece, violins that seem to pound with a drum counterpoint. The best kind of film music.And why wouldn't it be because North By Northwest is some of the best kind of film making.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An epic thriller from the great Alfred Hitchcock,"North by Northwest is my favorite movie - in a long list of favorites - from the great director Alfred Hitchcock. Also no doubt this is Cary Grant's best film. This is an epic thriller about a man who becomes a victim of mistaken identity, must go on the run from both the law and the bad guys, meanwhile trying to prove his innocence.The way this all happens is kind of absurd. Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) keeps finding himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Things - bad things - keep happening to him that are beyond his control. He winds up going on a cross country journey from NYC to South Dakota. Along the way he meets a beautiful woman (Eva Marie Saint) who may or may not be on his side. Watch also for James Mason as the shady character Vandamm and Martin Landau in an early role as the mysterious Leonard. Most of the time Thornhill can't really be sure who's a friend and who's an enemy. There is a lot of tension and a lot of thrills.This movie has similarities with Hitchcock's earlier classic, ""Saboteur"" (1942). I highly recommend that one also.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Easily Hitchcock's best,"Businessman Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistakenly thought to be a Federal agent. He is kidnapped by an evil man (James Mason). They soon realize they've captured the wrong man and try to have him killed. But it doesn't work and Thornhill finds himself a hunted man...OK--this is not perfect. There's some lousy back projection (but all Hitchcock films have that) and I was never really sure WHAT the bad guys were doing (something to do with microfilm). Also I've never believed Grant's actions when someone is killed in front of him (WHY did he grab the knife?). But the film is so incredibly entertaining no one has ever cared. This has some of Hitchcock's most famous scenes--the infamous ""crop dusting"" sequence and the climax on top of Mount Rushmore--but the whole film is just as good. There's a tense auction sequence and Grant's harrowing car ride down a treacherous road while dead drunk.There are some amusing parts in the film: Grant's mother appears to be a few years YOUNGER than him; the main villains last name is Vandamm; the romantic sparring between Grant and Eva Marie Saint is full of sexual innuendo; Martin Landau (one of Vandamm's henchman) is gay (he says he has a woman's intuition and has slightly exaggerated mannerisms--but it's not offensively done) and get a load of Vandamms mountain house at the end! Grant appears a bit old for this but he pulls it off; Eva Marie Saint is incredibly beautiful and pretty good as the love interest (sort of); Martin Landau is so young and handsome with blazing blue eyes and James Mason is just perfect as the evil Vandamm--his lines seem to come so effortlessly and he's so suave...but you also see the cruelty hiding underneath. Probably one of the best Hitchcock villains ever.So--excellent script with incredible dialogue; rich, bright Technicolor; shot in VistaVision (a wide screen process); great score and Hitchcock's always great direction with several astounding camera shots.

"Better than most, but not Hitchcock's best","This is acclaimed by many as one of Hitchcock's best films, but it is also known as one of his biggest blunders.  It is generally agreed that `The Master of Suspense' stumbled badly by revealing the identity of George Kaplan early in the film, in the scene where the CIA members discuss what to do about Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant).Thornhill is a heady advertising executive who is abducted at gunpoint and taken to a man named Vandamm (James Mason) who asks him cryptic questions and keeps calling him George Kaplan.  Thornhill responds that he doesn't know George Kaplan and that they are confusing him with someone else. Through this entire sequence, we are never sure whether he is Thornhill or Kaplan.  The film would have been far more intriguing if this were left a mystery until the end, rather than having it cleared up twenty minutes into the plot.It is thought that Hitchcock believed that the introduction of Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) would replace one mystery with an even better one. However, Eve's motivations are too transparent and even of the dullest of viewers can discern that their meeting on the train is no chance encounter. Eve is far too forward and obvious, especially for the 1950's.  It is hard to believe there is anyone who wouldn't be a tad suspicious at her behavior. Though we are left with more than a few questions about Eve after the love scene, imagine how wonderfully confused we would have been if Kaplan's identity weren't revealed so early in the film.  We would know only what Thornhill knew about why he was being pursued and seduced, which is next to nothing.Despite these flaws, the film is still intriguing, with a number of unpredictable twists.  The second half of the film is much tighter, and the chase scene on the face of Mount Rushmore is one the classic suspense scenes in the history of film.  Hitchcock tried to get permission to shoot the scene on the real Rushmore, but he was refused.  Not to be deterred, he had his own Mount Rushmore set built that was indistinguishable from the original earning an Oscar nomination for set decoration.The acting is excellent.  Cary Grant is at his debonair best as the acerbic ad executive who is beguiled by Eve's beauty and charm.  Eva Marie Saint is best known for her movie debut as Edie in `On The Waterfront', but she is every bit as good in this film.  Hers is a very complex character, duplicitous and devious, yet vulnerable and torn, and she handles it with facility.  James Mason is enigmatic and elusive as VanDamm and a youthful Martin Landau does a nice job as VanDamm's tough lieutenant.I enjoyed this film, but I don't believe it attains the level of excellence of Hitchcock's other renowned films (`Psycho', `Vertigo' and `Rear Window'). I rated it 9/10 with a point deducted for blowing the Kaplan question. Even so, a bad day for Hitchcock is like the best day for most directors.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

There was enough going on that I wanted to know how things were going to turn out, and there were even a few situations in which it was impossible to know who's side a particular character was on. All that worked very well for me.I was also impressed by the performances from the three primary leads. Cary Grant was quite good as Roger Thornhill, a New York City businessman who through a case of mistaken identity ends up on the run as apparently Eastern bloc agents try to pull off some sort of scheme (that isn't really revealed until close to the end of the movie.) Thornhill is maybe a little too good at times - your normal businessman who seems to take too readily to the undercover espionage business. But Grant did well as the character. James Mason was the villain Philip Vandamm and was able to offer the perfect combination of menace and charm - just enough to make his character (who could have been quite one dimensional) interesting. And, of course, there had to be a beautiful woman - in this case Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall, who becomes involved with Thornhill but is actually working for Vandamm.I'm not sure that I'd agree that this was Hitchcock's finest performance as a director. He made a movie that was engaging, but not really spellbinding, although he managed to do a good job of gradually building the suspense.Certainly,. this is a very good movie. I'd argue, though, that it's a wee bit over-rated. Still very good, though. (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Hitchcock's Best,"I am a huge Hitchcock fan, and compared to some of his others including the mind-numblingly dull ""Suspicion"" or the messy ""Rebecca,"" this one shines, along with ""Psycho"" as one of his best films.Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, a New York businessman who is suddenly thrust into a conspiracy that plots him as a killer. With no one to trust, and no one who believes him, he goes on the run, fleeing deeper and deeper into the mystery and the peril. On a train to Chicago one night, he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a steely blonde who he becomes involved with both romantically and in this plot against him. The lives of the two intertwine continuously through the rest of the chase, where the characters and plot twist like a winding mountain road, which is a perfect analogy for this movie, which climaxes on Mt. Rushmore, in one of the most gripping, suspenseful climaxes Hitch has ever directed.This truly is a great movie, in all ways. The music is appropriate and extremely well-fitting, and is in second to the theme of ""Psycho"" as the best music in a Hitchcock film. The acting is totally on par, especially by the two stars. The chemistry between the two of them on the train is perfect, and adds to the list of memorable pieces of this movie, along with the famous cropduster scene (which had me cringing in fear) and that gripping, edge-of-your-seat, breathtaking climax on Mt. Rushmore. Hitchcock has never directed a climax as good as that. This is his best, second being the gasp-inducing climax to ""Psycho."" I loved the way the character of Eve Kendall changed so many times, and twisted and turned. At first she appears to just be that girl that will end up by Thornhill's side the whole movie, then she becomes the double-crossing spy, but then she double-crosses the enemies, and we realize so much more about her, that she becomes the most versatile character in the film, played to honest perfection by Eva Marie Saint. And also to mention was the very creepy-looking Martin Landau in a smaller role as one of the spies. Just the look in his eye made him a great antagonist.This really is a great movie, and as I said, one of Hitchcock's best. Hitch really came a long way from his minimal British productions, all of which seemed to look and feel the same. This is definitely one of the best chase movies around, and has remained as powerful as it was when it first came out.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"""I'd invite you to my bedroom if I had a bedroom.""","Allow me to add my voice to the overwhelming praise for this classic Alfred Hitchcock thriller; one of the legendary director's best. Cary Grant stars (in the last of four collaborations with Hitchcock) as an advertising executive mistaken for a spy and chased cross-country by foreign agents, as well as the police. What follows is one classic scene after another, including the famous scene where Grant is chased by a crop duster. James Mason and Martin Landau make excellent villains. Eva Marie Saint is the sexy double agent who shares some sizzling scenes with Cary. The two had palpable chemistry. Healthy doses of comedy help make this such an enjoyable watch. A great cast, a rousing score by Bernard Herrmann, and flawless pacing by Hitch are among the many elements that make this one of the most fun and exciting movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

MASTERPIECE!!,"It had to be Alfred Hitchcook, one of the best directors of all time. I simply loved this film, I think it was all very well constructed and the story is very good. The chase scenes are very good, considering the year the film was released (1959) and the suspense scenes too, it's no wonder that people call Hitchcook the ""Master of Suspense"". The soundtrack is also very good and is a good accompaniment, as are the performances, which I think are some of the best of their time. I wanted to highlight Alfred's genius, because not just anyone can make a film like this, and also because of the uncertainty that the film transmits to the viewer, who never knows what will happen next. The conclusion I can draw is that I loved this film and that it is without a doubt one of the best ever, and, in my opinion, Alfred Hitchcook's best film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not So Bad...,"I had high hopes for North By Northwest. Frequently regarded as a film among the greatest thrillers ever produced. Especially if they were directed by the master of suspense.If one desires to watch North By Northwest, merely watch everything before the Mount Rushmore scenes. That is the actual good portion of the film.I honestly couldn't get invested in any of the characters. Maybe I cared for Roger here and there. I didn't particularly care for the so-called 'plot-twist'.Visually speaking, it must have been extremely exciting for audiences back in 1959. Who could blame them?

"""Now you listen to me, I'm an advertising man, not a red herring.""","NORTH BY NORTHWEST is an adventurous spy thriller that impresses with an exciting story, delicious romance, excellent dialogue, rich characterization and fresh humor. One successful, suave, married and divorced expert on advertising is accidentally involved into an international spy network of intrigue and conspiracy. He has been replaced for an international spy. His quiet life has turned upside down...One nonchalant character is exposed to a serious spy game. He was pushed into a series of shocking and confusing situation at the beginning of the film. These situations are enriched with a large dose of a fresh humor. Hitch has presented a serious life situation or perhaps intriguing drama on a very entertaining way. The main character is not aware of the fraud. He is simply the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time.After that, Hitch has moved his protagonists to an exciting game between a search and pursuit. It is a strange game between cats and mice. An extremely rich scenery comes to the fore in these parts of the film.There is also an eight-minute scene, which I would describe as a masterpiece of cinema. The scene representing expectation through fear of the unknown, tension and excitement. It ends with the climatic action.Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill is a puppet, a charmer and a hero in this film. Mr. Grant is one of the most versatile actors of all time. It can be noticed, when he has created his own rules of the game. He is a somewhat clumsy, self-confident and foolhardy character. Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall is a seemingly fragile, mysterious and dangerous woman. Her character reminds of heroines from James Bond films. The chemistry between the main protagonists is quite good. Their interplay and romantic dialogues with sexual connotation are very favorable.Their support are Jessie Royce Landis (Clara Thornhill) as a silly Roger's mother, James Mason (Phillip Vandamm) as a smooth villain, Martin Landau (Leonard), who has a homosexual trait in his character and Leo G. Carroll (The Professor) as the voice of reason.Mr. Hitchcock has, as a proof of his mastery, toyed with the audience and censorship at the end of the movie.This is an exciting and very entertaining movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Excellent albeit a bit confusing thriller, but the end justifies the means","No spoilers here but simply by stating that the film was directed by one of the top ranked directors in Alfred Hitchcock and stars the attractive Eve Marie Saint and Cary Grant, how could the film miss? Well, it couldn't miss being a hit, and it does not disappoint.Although I found the initial misrepresentation of Ad Executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) being mistaken for a guy named George Kaplan more than a bit far fetched the rest of the film flows nicely.The interaction and gradual romance between the Ad Executive Roger Thornhill, and the mysterious lady Eve Kendall, (Eve Marie Saint) who aggressively and unapologetically chases Roger Thornhill during a train ride over dinner leaves little to Ms. Kendall's intentions, or does it? As with any good Alfred Hitchcock film look for a few twists and turns figuratively and literally.This is a Thriller worth watching at least twice. I give the film a solid 7 out of 10 IMDB rating.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hasn't Aged Well,"Hitchcock was likely a genius in his day, and many of his films extraordinary. But at least this one has aged poorly. I was prompted to revisit it because I'm making my own Shakespeare film festival, and the title of this ostensibly comes from Hamlet. He is mad north by northwest as a ruse. There is nothing remotely as sophisticated here.What this film has going for it is Grant's suave composure in adversity, which must have been rare 40 years ago. But this has been played to death in recent decades.What it has against it:--the sets, even the monument are obviously fake junk--the story is unbelieveable. This is normal in film, but in this case there are assumptions about the cold war which even in historic context seem offensive.--there are huge logic holes: for instance the bad guys are spies who on the one hand must hide microfilm in a statue, but at the same time fly their escape plane into one of the most popular national parks!--Eva just isn't that charming, and what's up with her motivation? She's a prostitute that turned good at risk to her life because of patriotism?--If Grant is to be killed, why lure him to a remote location so he can be run down by a biplane? Why does the plane run into the gas truck?--If the spy is so smart, why kidnap Grant and take him to a house illegally borrowed from the head of Intepol? Recall that they knew (or thought they did) that Grant knew who he really was, and they intended to kill him anyway. Why the charade?--Hitchcock was a clever user of the camera, with scenes well framed. But that was in the era of largely stationary cameras. A moving camera was so rare as to have been then a noticable effect. Not so today. Hitchcock's camera is just plain primitive now.--Grant was already an old man. His curvature of the spine is noticeable as well as his stiff gait.--Any tension felt by prior generations was lost on me, and I'm a pretty old guy myself!Lord Edward Bulwar Lytton was highly regarded in his day too. Now, he's a joke, of interest only to historians of the novel. To me, this film is only of historic interest.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"A funny, compelling and enjoyable ride definitely worth taking","North by Northwest is a funny, compelling and enjoyable ride definitely worth taking. Hitchcock always knows how to reel in an audience with his intros. The bombastic symphonic soundtrack mixed with the graphics and the shots of hustling bustling New York get you ready. Another beautifully filmed film by Hitchcock. Again Hitchcock uses some fantastic filming locations. Some of which are interiors that feel quite cozy. That was cool how they filmed on location at Mount Rushmore. The architecture and design of that big house by the monument was gorgeous. The dialogue is compelling, clever and funny - very well written material right here. I would even say it's what drives the movie forward. The performances as well, especially by Grant, also propel the movie forward.Cary Grant talking to his mother on the phone at the police station while drunk was pretty damn funny. ""No they didn't give me a chaser!"", was a good one. The delivery of lines from Cary in this movie is just perfection. The line ""Naughty, wicked, up to no good, you ever kill anyone?"" got me, I laughed way too hard. Cary's on his A-game in this movie. Both hilarious and charming. There's a lot of quotable and memorable lines in this movie. The blonde girl, Eve, is something else. She has an alluring seductive charm to her as all Hitchcock female leads do. Hitchcock has this incredible way of filming romantic kissing scenes that always come off steamy and sensual. The chemistry between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint (Eve Kendall) is fantastic.I thought this movie was going to be a bit more on the serious side but I was pleasantly surprised with how comedic and lighthearted it took itself. I actually really enjoyed it. The build up to the crop field chase scene was done so well. The use of wide shots to show the arid lifeless Indiana fields. I always love how Hitchcock can subvert expectations. Like I wasn't expecting the airplane to collide into the tanker, that was crazy. I was laughing because it was so out nowhere. The idea popped into my head for a brief second but I didn't think it would actually happen. Hitchcock has a very cheeky sense of humor too and you see it in the way he makes a brief cameo in his movies. I love Hitchcock.It's quite the interesting and clever case of mistaken identity. It's quite amazing how he gets roped into something that's way bigger than him unintentionally and by accident and goes on this grand espionage/man on the run journey. It's almost like this is Hitchcock's way of fulfilling his fantasy of becoming a spy in real life and it plays out sort of like a daydream that someone has at work. I wonder if 'Richie Rich' got the idea of climbing down the monument from this movie. The sexual innuendos in this movie are great. Namely the ending with Thornhill pulling Eve up to the bed and then the camera cutting to the train going high speed into the tunnel lol. Overall, fantastic film. Another great addition to Hitchcock's collection. I highly highly recommend watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film that will always be able to hold its own against modern adventure thrillers,"There's something so timeless about ""North by Northwest"" and it's not necessarily that it will echo with any generation. Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill, for example, feels a little foreign among today's thriller protagonists (accent aside) as a 50-year-old everyday man thrown into a mess of a government situation. The action is certainly not big- budget like modern films either with the exception of one explosion. The ""it"" that ""Northwest"" has is something more unique and a lot of it stems from great thriller writing and of course the direction of Sir Alfred Hitchcock.""Northwest"" follows the story of how Thornhill is taken against his will and accused of being a man named George Kaplan. These men try and kill Thornhill and have concocted elaborate cover-ups, to the point that Thornhill has no choice but to do whatever he must to prove his innocence, which actually leads him deeper into the mystery of George Kaplan. The writing of Ernest Lehman is absolutely terrific and it seems a shame that Hitchcock never collaborated with him again. The dialogue is not only very pointed and helpful to the plot, but also the plot movement with its twists and turns and clever way of revealing information to the viewer is simply classic Cold War spy thriller stuff, the skeletal structure that would later become synonymous with someone by the name of James Bond, despite ""North by Northwest"" predating Bond by three years.Although Roger Thornhill has nothing on James Bond, ""North by Northwest"" gets to boast Hitchcock's signature directing. No one seems to choose better moments to employ certain shot techniques than Hitchcock. He knows how to turn the best parts of the film into highly memorable and often times unforgettable scenes. The crop-duster attack is easily one of the greatest scenes in thriller movie history, specifically the shot where he's running as the plane gets larger and closer in the background. The difference between Hitchcock and the rest when it comes to a cross-country thriller like this is largely editing and length of takes. Hitchcock creates intensity by letting things build, like lengthy takes of the cars driving down the highway or the plane circling around to make another pass.From Thornhill's drunken escape to the cropduster sequence to a finale on Mount Rushmore, so much of ""North by Northwest"" remains unique, even to this day, even after all the Bond movies modeled after it and despite archetypes like Eva Marie Saint's femme fatale character. It has a certain inventiveness (and a certain director) that will always allow it to stand out.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"The greatest Hitchcock film, stunning and perfect","This film is probably where Hitchcock's genius rose to its greatest height. I have seen it several times over the years, and it keeps getting better and better. Now we have a Blu-ray remastered version, so I have seen it again, all crisp and new. A large part of the success of this film is due to Ernest Lehman, who wrote the screenplay. He was one of Hollywood's top screenwriters and his skills were crucial in making this story work. The film is gripping from the first scene to the last, and never loses its tension for a moment. Cary Grant's somewhat weird personality was perfect for the lead role in this tale of mysterious intrigue. The combination of his droll insouciance and dry humour with his expressions of continually surprised astonishment is just the right mix. I can't think of any other actor who could so perfectly have compounded the variegated tinctures of ambiguity into this sublime decoction of suspense. (What do you mean, that last sentence was affected?) As for Eva Marie Saint, never was she so glorious as in this picture. She has just the right mix as well. And those two mixes went well together, and are the very opposite of oil and water. Or to put it another way, everything gells. And then there is James Mason as the unctuous smoothie bad guy. He really knew how to be convincing at that, and the way he puts his hand on Eva Marie Saint's shoulder in the auction room, to say 'you are mine', is done so delicately but so emphatically. He was always the master of understatement, Every gesture, every grimace is perfectly planned and plotted. Hitchcock was passionate about story-boarding all his films, and this one is a living story-board. Not one thing is out of place, the film was perfectly executed according to plan. It ticks better than any Swiss watch in history. Tick, tick, tick, and the wheels go round and things happen relentlessly, all precisely timed. The most famous episode in this film is probably when Cary Grant gets off a bus in the middle of a corn field in absolutely nowhere and a crop-spraying plane comes after him, trying to kill him. Who says such things never happen? I saw it with my own eyes, in a Hitchcock film, so it must be true.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Games . . . must we?""","There are so many iconic elements to North by Northwest, from Bernard Herrmann's complicated score, to the chase scene between Cary Grant and an airplane, to Eva Marie Saint's come-on, ""I don't particularly like the book I'm reading,"" to the location of the end action scene. While everyone has their favorite parts to the movie, mine are not the most famous. My favorite scene is when Cary Grant drunkenly phones his mother from the police station. It's easily the funniest scene in the film, and I happen to adore Cary when he's in his humorous element. My favorite line in the film has become a frequently used household phrase of my family's: James Mason, in one of his iconic villainous roles, smirks at Cary and asks, ""Games . . . must we?"" in his imitable accent. It's hilarious, and we frequently say, ""James . . . must we?"" instead when we joke about him or his movies.I don't really like North by Northwest, even though I've seen it over a dozen times. It's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films, and everyone in my family really likes it, so it was one of the classics I was raised on as a kid. In general, I find Hitchcock's movies to be a little slow, and I don't think Eva Marie Saint is as appealing as her role necessitates. If it weren't for Cary and James, I'd probably never watch this movie, but their energies together are great fun to watch. They were friends in real life, and when they verbally spar, it almost feels like they're playing a-dare I say it?-game.The plot is always a very intriguing one: an innocent misunderstanding leads certain people to believe Cary Grant has a different name, and he becomes implicated in a very dangerous situation. Since Cary's entirely innocent, it's easy to root for him, but since James is so charming and funny, it's incredibly easy to root for him, too. Aren't the best stories the ones where you're torn between rooting for the bad and good guys? If you think so, you'll probably really like North by Northwest. If you don't end up liking it, then you can ask the screen, ""James . . . must we?""",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Influential spy epic,"North by Northwest, which has horrible translations to French with La mort aux trousses and German with Der unsichtbare Dritte, is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movies. This vivid action-thriller and spy epic has influenced franchises like James Bond and many others. Despite a certain nostalgic charm regarding clothes, lifestyles and settings, the movie has aged quite well and is still very entertaining sixty years after its initial release and beyond.The story revolves around a charming advertising executive who is mistaken for a secret agent, kidnapped, poisoned and left for dead. He survives by chance but nobody seems to believe his story and he is instead charged with driving under the influence. The ambitious young man desires to clear his name and starts investigating. Soon enough, he is in the middle of a dangerous conflict between a shady businessman and his associates and the real government agents he has been mistaken for. Along with a mysterious woman who befriends and helps him on a train ride, he travels northwest through the United States of America to figure out what he has been involved with.North by Northwest convinces on numerous levels. The story is twisted, mysterious and dynamic as it will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The iconic action sequences have stood the test of time and are still breathtaking to watch. The unfirgettable locations are chosen with care, intellect and precision. The camera work is very precise and still an example to follow by contemporary standards. The acting performances are charismatic and especially the lead character is truly unique.There are only two minor elements that need to be criticized. The female lead character feels somewhat superficial as she almost instantly falls in love with a perfect stranger despite her pivotal role in the story. Another thing that bothered me was the abrupt ending which could have been a little bit more fluid without overstaying its welcome.Still, North by Northwest is a movie you should watch at least once in your lifetime if you like crime films in general and spy movies in particular.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A king of movies,"Not only is this the best Hitchcock, this is one of the best films ever made.  Don't let the date, 1959, scare you off, this has everything possible for a movie: great, believable acting from all(Grant, Saint, Mason, Landau, and even the minor players); stunning cinematography(decades ahead of its time), fantastic stunts(the air-duster scene, and the Mount Rushmore finale), a brilliant score by Bernard Herrmann, and the perfect mixture of action, humor, and a dash of romance.One lesson that all modern film makers could learn from this movie is timing.  With some rare exceptions, many of today's movies have good story lines, but waste several minutes on meaningless scenes (Lost Souls, or Traffic, to name a couple).  Hitchcock proved a movie can be over two hours and still keep you in suspense. Do yourself a favor and rent this, better yet, own it. You'll want to watch it more than once.",,Anonymous,Mystery

So Many Surprises,"""North by Northwest"" is gripping and enticing from beginning to end. A classic film, too many things have been written about this one. I'll try to fill in a few of my own observations.The viewer is hooked into the world of Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) instantly. We see him getting abducted very early on in the film, and from that point plunged unwillingly into a twisted plot of corruption and deception. The viewer is fed bits of information to piece together throughout, but it's often at a much later time that Mr. Thornhill is able to grasp these revelations, which really shows Hitchcock's mastery of tense and suspenseful filmmaking and storytelling.A small negative for me personally is the hokey romantic dialogue. It is fitting for its time. Most of the dialogue and acting in this movie is stellar, especially from Grant's female co-star Eva Marie Saint, who plays the beautiful and seductive character Eve Kendall. The romantic subplot is nice, it adds to the overall intrigue, but I just have a very small and minor nitpick over the dialogue. It's a personal taste though, it doesn't detract from the overall objective quality of the movie.Highest accolades and recommendations for this most monumental and influential thriller masterpiece, ""North by Northwest.""",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Why not Hitchcock's best?,"To summarise, let's just say this is over two hours long and yet seems to last only minutes. You just wish it were longer.And all the clichés in it were there for the first time: we've just seen them so many times since. I think it was in his conversations with Truffaut that Hitchcock said that, when a character is on the run in a film, he is always shown as walking down rain-washed cobbled streets, hiding in the night, but Hitchcock wanted to change all that and make it as light as possible, hence the crop-duster scene ... as every director has done ever since.Back-projection has never been that good in Hitchcock's films, I'm sorry to say. I think that film-goers were just expected to accept it at the time. But I think the special effects in the finale (now where was it set?) are superb, and I really feel that the actors and stand-ins are really there (I was surprised it wasn't actually filmed there) ... apart from the studio inserts, that is.But the plot is entirely original (or so I believe, but you always find something in the archives ...); Lehman's lines are very witty (and sexy!); the casting is superb (Grant never turned in a bad performance, and Landau, Mason and, especially, Carroll, setting himself up for his long-term role in his later acting career, are outstanding); and, like all Hitchcock's films, it's a fine comedy (and Psycho is the biggest joke of all). So why do all the critics always favour Vertigo, Rear Window, Strangers on a Train, The Trouble with Harry or Psycho?Well, North by Northwest is my favourite Hitchcock anyway.And I'm sure I don't have to mention Herrmann's massive contribution.In fact, my only objection is James Mason's cardigan.

Still, I'd change that pair of gray socks for a pair of black socks anytime.The plot is full of surprises and it's quite hard to predict anything until much later in the movie, so be prepared for quite a few twists along the movie.

The Crop dusting chase, the Mt.Rushmore sequences would give any Bond movie or any other pretentious Big Budget Actioner a run for their money.My only regret was that the protagonist was played by Cary Grant. He may have been a looker, but he looked plain old here.

Play It Cool,"North By Northwest -On watching this movie as a sixteen year old, I was thrilled at the scope of the chase unfolding before my eyes. When I watch it again last night, I wasn't as impressed due to paying more attention to the corny exchanges between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. The crop duster episode still seemed the most enthralling sequence of the film; not only as a result of masterful suspense, but also because there's no opportunity for cringeworthy innuendo.A few films from the 1950s, such as this one and Anatomy of a Murder, had daring scripts, but now seem too forced. If a man used Thornhill's lines on a night out in this day and age, he'd be shunned and laughed at no matter how handsome he is.SB",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock's Best,"One of the most interesting elements I found in ""North by Northwest"" was the way that Alfred Hitchcock toyed with the audience with the role of Eve Kendall. Here is a strong, sophisticated, and independent young woman that is neither played as a bitch nor merely eye candy for the hungry male audience. I have found that the crucial weakness of many movies of the 1950's and 60's is the fact that the strong woman must be punished for her independent instincts. In fact, this could easily be argued of many films today. A strong leading female character is just as rare in Hollywood today as it was fifty years ago. If the times have changed, many of the movies surely haven't.One of the many things that I found intriguing by the character of Eve Kendall was her ability to show empathy while, as the same time, staying true to herself. For example, take a look at the scene in which Roger Thornhill tells Eve, in a heartbreakingly real speech, just how much her deception has betrayed him. Even in this scene, where Eve is the ""bad guy"", she is able to show just how much she deeply cares for this man. Maybe it's a sign of great acting or exceptional directing (the close up shot of her just as he leaves is incredible) but, either way, this is a character that we rarely see in movies today.Here is a character that is not only sexual but innocent. She is neither exploited for her actions nor is she looked down on for being a female of carnal needs. If Roger is unsure and wary about sex, Eve knows exactly what she wants and what she shall get. In this aspect alone, ""North by Northwest"" was a movie years ahead of its time.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Perhaps Great for its Time - But Acting Not Convincing,"Well i always try to check movies off my ""Must See Before Dying"" list and so i turned this one on. The movie has a great premise and story... my only problem was Cary Grant.I thought he was great on the train scenes with the girl... but as far as the drunk scene, and a normal person who's life is in jeopardy multiple times he just didn't seem real to me... like he didn't take any of it seriously. Just not convincing for a good part of the movie.I think this movie would have been great even now had there been someone more convincing in that role someone who was really concerned with living/dying rather than a regular citizen trying to portray a 007 veteran coolness.Again the part on the train (witty exchanges with the woman) were great and you could really pick up on the innuendo of the times.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Slow, dated and boring","Cary Grant, who lived with Randolph Scott for twelve years from 1932 to 1944, was far too old at 55 to be playing the romantic lead. It's hilarious that he looks the same age as the actress playing his mother - horrendously bad casting. This movie is a slow, overlong, dated and boring and it certainly cannot be compared to any of the Bond movies. In contrast to what some other reviewers here have claimed, Grant was never offered the Bond role, because he was far too old at 58. If this rubbish had been half an hour shorter, filmed on location instead of on fake-looking studio sets, and if it hadn't been so slow then maybe it would be watchable. William Holden would have been far better as Roger Thornhill.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitch's Best,"I agree with so many of the comments here---and I too feel it's Hitchcock's very best.  All the elements are perfect.  It's hard to pick a favorite scene, but I think it's the sequence at VanDam's house at Mt. Rushmore.  I would love to know about that house.  How much of this was a set piece?  Was it really at Mt. Rushmore?  That kind of thing.  Email me if you have any info.  Also, does anybody agree Grant may have blown a line when he said, ""He's assembling the General Assembly this afternoon""?  Should that not have been, ""He addressing the General Assembly this afteroon""?  I've seen this movie more times than I can count and that has always seemed curious to me. And its always to fun to see the boy stick his fingers in his ears before the gun fires in the Mt. Rushmore cafeteria.  A classic for Gaffe Squad addicts.  And, I've always felt the chase over Mt. Rushmore is one of the very best illusions created in the movies.  A superb achievement in Art Direction.  And if you really want to put this film under a microscope, count how many quick cuts are made after Thornhill gets off the bus at the prarrie stop and is taking stock of where he is out in the middle of nowhere.  Finally, if you are a Hitchcock fan you know how good he was with scary faces.  And NbyNW is loaded with them.  Would love to hear from other fans of this great film--my alltime favorite without question.",,Anonymous,Mystery
The Midpoint Movie,"The great ""North by Northwest"" comes at the mid-point of entertainment film history.  When Alfred Hitchcock made it in 1959, it was the culmination of thrillers he had made:  30's British spy chase thrillers like ""The 39 Steps"" and 40's American World War II spy chase thrillers like ""Saboteur"" and ""Foreign Correspondent.""   ""North by Northwest"" was Hitchcock's greatest chase, part self-homage, part self-parody.All those chase movies came BEFORE ""North by Northwest,"" and then this midpoint movie influenced every action thriller that came AFTER it: ""North by Northwest"" led to James Bond which led to Indiana Jones which led to ""The Matrix.""But besides being historic, ""North by Northwest"" is as good as a classic gets:   three classic action set-pieces (the car, the crop-duster, Mount Rushmore), some of the wittiest dialogue in the history of movies;  Cary Grant at his best, James Mason at his best, Eva Marie Saint at her best. Spectacular modern fifties credit sequence by Saul Bass with Bernard Herrmann's exciting score (launched by the MGM lion's roar.)It's not ""The Matrix,"" but take a time machine back to 1959 and enjoy the most influential chase thriller of all time.And remember Cary Grant, as Roger Thornhill, delivering this great line:  "" I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives, and several bartenders waiting for me, and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting myself slightly killed.""",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock's Most Entertaining Thriller...,"The 1950's was an amazing decade for Alfred Hitchcock.  Year after year, he churned out some sort of a classic: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, etc..  He capped it with the most exciting film he ever directed. NORTH BY NORTHWEST is sheer escapist entertainment, a non-stop ride across the country, with Hitch dealing out his usual cards.  Innocent man (Cary Grant) in a crazy situation which he is wrongfully drawn into, and the beautiful leading lady (Eva Marie Saint), who always seem to be blonde.  I also have to say that musical composer Bernard Herrmann has produced one of his top 3 scores (the other 2 being TAXI DRIVER and PSYCHO).  Right from the opening title sequence, we are souring into this story of international intrigue, decoys, and constant pursuit.The film barely lets up as Grant, in his own dashing manner, plays it cool as an advertising exec who becomes surrounded by the bad guys before we even get settled into our seats.  This is the mother of all modern action/chase films, with pitstops at the UN building, Grand Central Station, Chicago, a vast cornfield, and finally, Mount Rushmore.  Grant's scene on the field has become one of the most famous sequences of all-time.  That dust-cropper definitely had a mind of its own.  The great thing about the scene is that about 90% of it was shot on location.  Again, listen to that music.  It explodes with the suspense of the scene.You never know what side of the fence Hitch's characters are on at times. Is there a real ""Kaplan""?  Why did the bad guys pick Grant as their target? Eva Marie Saint is not so saintly as the alluring blonde who has some kind of angle on the events herself.  You're never really sure what she is up to. This is the greatness and originality of the ""worlds"" Hitchcock and his writers create.  Things are never as they appear.  It is up to the viewer to pay attention or let him play you like a fiddle.  Either way, you come out satisfied.This is not his 'best' film.  It is his most thrilling flick, and it also has the refreshing sense of humor that enlighten Hitch's best pictures. In terms of action and adventure, this has no equal within his library of films with perhaps the exception of 1940's FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT.  Great dialogue, slick and stylish directing, and a sense of pure fun makes this one better.RATING - 10 of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
North by Northwest proves that great art can also be entertaining.,"Alfred Hitchcock made this film at the height of his genius and also at the height of his popularity, when his television show gave him the kind of exposure and face recognition usually reserved for only the biggest stars. Hitch always maintained that great films should also entertain, North by Northwest being presented here as our star witness to prove his assertion to be correct.Cary Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill as the slick Madison Avenue advertising man who is mistaken to be George Kaplin, a spy hot on the trail of Phillip Vandamm, played masterfully by James Mason. All we really know about Thornhill is the statement he makes to Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) on the train from New York to Chicago that he has a mother, several bartenders and two ex-wives dependant upon him for support. The ""O"" used to initial his middle name stands for ""nothing"" and his initials, R.O.T., sum up his life. These details are revealing and the scene is beautifully crafted, showing us the apparent emptiness of his life prior to this adventure. Ernst Lehman's script is loaded with these types of gems throughout the picture.If you're really not into excellent dialogue and clever acting and prefer that the story get on with it, this also is the movie for you, as it has two of the most memorable action sequences in the history of motion pictures. Of course I'm referring to the crop dusting sequence and the finale on top of Mount Rushmore. Those are enough to put this movie near the top of anyone's must see list.Kudos are also due to Leo G. Carroll in one of his best character roles as The Professor, who's humble appearance belies the fact that he is the one who is responsible for manipulating much of the action behind the scenes. A young Martin Landau, as Leonard, Vandamm's ""right arm"", shows us in the few scenes that he's in what a capable actor he was. The music by the great Bernard Herrmann is one of the classic pieces that made him famous, starting from the clever opening title sequence to it's conclusion.If we view this movie in its historical context of 1959, we see that it was made in the middle of the Cold War, and much of the suspense is reliant upon the audience's reality of living with the knowledge that everything could end with the press of a button (I know this is too simplistic, but many people's perception at this point in history was just that). The Professor, Vandamm, Ms. Kendall, Leonard and others are Cold Warriors, and it is Thornhill's misfortune to become swept up in it's intrigues, but our very great fortune to be able to get swept up with him and let Hitcock, the ""Master of Suspense"", be our guide in one of his masterworks.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock's Ninth Symphony,"Action and suspense: A hapless New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies,
Asking which is the best Hitchcock is something like asking which is the best Beethoven symphony, but if pressed to the wall I would call NBNW Hitchcock's Ninth (and Psycho, his Fifth).
The coolest of Grant and the hottest of Marie Saint is simply
the coolest film ever made from every angle you can think of.
Few people would contend that Cary Grant was not the coolest leading man of Hollywood's golden age but this pic is the peak of his coolness, along with that the coolest James Mason ever as the smoothest polite villain of all time and the slinkiest Eva Marie Saint ever, all adds up to one of the most satisfying pieces of celluloid entertainment ever conceived.
Most Hitchcock movies have one unforgettable white knuckle cliff hanger sequence but NBNW has two -- the chase out in the wheatfields by a poisonous crop duster biplane and the final chase across the faces of the four presidents at Mount Rushmore, which ends up literally ... as a cliffhanger.
Even a third if you include the comical auction scene where Grant keeps making outrageous bids to attract the police and thus escape the clutches of the killers lurking in the room waiting to get him.
So much has been written about this picture that there is no need to recount the plot other to say that it is a towering masterpiece of the romantic suspense drama genre with all players at the top of their game - and don't forget a young menacing Martin Landau as Mason's cold blooded sidekick, another great actor who just passed away on July 15, 2017 at age 89.
NBNW is frequently rerun on TV so it's not hard to catch up with but it never gets old or fails to make you hold your breath even when you know what's coming next. An ultimate classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""Tease a man to death""","North by Northwest, among the best-known of all Hitchcock pictures, was in fact begun with the specific intention of creating (in the words of its writer Ernest Lehman) ""the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures"". And to this end it does seem to tour faithfully round all the familiar stops on the Hitchcockian trail – the falsely accused man, the espionage backdrop the exact details of which are not elucidated, the showdown on a famous monument, the dry wit and the sharp innuendo. This may make it the most archetypal, but does it make it the best? One thing that really stands out about North by Northwest is that it is one of Hich's more comedy-laced scripts. Or more accurately, the comedy is more tightly interwoven, rather than being kept as a standalone feature for certain scenes or characters. And while there are some good laughs here, such as Cary Grant's nonchalant wisecracking when he is first kidnapped (which really makes us warm to the character), it seems to be at the expense of the action. You see, although there are certainly a lot of speedy chases, narrow escapes and cunning getaways, not a single one of them is up to Hitch's best standard. The drunk-driving chase for example is more awkward than nailbiting. There is simply no material for Hitchcock to do some grand orchestration of suspense, like say the concert hall scene from The Man Who Knew Too Much or the finales of Rear Window and Psycho. All in all this wrong-manhunt seems more like a case of annoyance rather than something to inspire the old ""it-could-happen-to-you"" fear factor.That is not to say there are not good things about North by Northwest. In fact there are plenty. Hitch's direction is on-the-ball as ever, with lots of set-ups where the characters are walking (or running) towards the camera, coupled with moving point-of-view shots, which places us somewhat forcibly within the action. This, coupled with a tight editing scheme, at least makes this 130-minute picture move at a considerable pace. Grant is perfectly suited to the resourceful but unassuming hero, and his laidback approach to comedy makes the most of the witty screenplay. It provides a great role for James Mason too, the suaveness and good looks that made him a desirable lead man in his youth now make him the perfect devilish villain in his middle age. Then there is the hard-hitting main theme by composer Bernard Hermann, the sparseness of which prefigures his stabbing strings for Psycho.However the fact remains that, while this may be very much the tailor-made Hitchcock classic, the finished product is more of a Hitchcock mediocrity. It lacks the sense of showmanship, the shock value and the spiralling tension that really made his finest pictures stand out.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Quite entertaining although not that solidly built,"The story's basic premise is quite nice, especially for the era of the 1960s. It has since seen many other movie productions using the similar basic premise of ordinary people being mistaken as spies. The screenplay development isn't really that good, though, considering there's too much talk compared to significant spies work or fugitive hunting or avoiding capture, which what the movie is perceived to be offering. The technical things rather annoy me, like there is a strange and imbalanced lighting all over the movie, and the user of too much backdrop for background video. Yes those are maybe tolerable for those era, but for the later times like such as now, they seem quite stupid. The acting is quite nice, the actors try their best not too overact the scenes, yet they still do in a greater part of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Great Action Film,"I really enjoyed North by Northwest, it was refreshing to see a Hollywood action film with so little blood shed.  When in the right mood I definitely enjoy some good and gory fun; but these days all the good guy/ bad guy films seem to have the same theme: bigger guns and more blood equal success.  Yet here is a film that made me tense when Mr. Townsend and his entourage appeared and had me cheering for Eve Kendall.  More film makers ought to follow Hitchcock's style of film making; subtle and calculated art sometimes makes for a more entertaining experience.  The guns were small when they took Mr. Thornhill to see Townsend for the first time, and the crop duster scene  was rather simple.  This film shows that having a big budget and lots of special effects does not make a great movie; using music, camera angles and great actors with 1950's means can create something much more inspired and fun to watch.  Sometimes things in life do not have to be made complicated, you do not have to utterly dazzle the public every time.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Now, quite firmly my all-time favorite Hitchcock movie","I watched my first Hitchcock movie, Psycho, in my last year of high school and I immediately became a fan. Over the following 25 years though I have noticed that my favorite Hitchcock movie has continued to change. It was Psycho for many years, but sometime in the mid- 1990s, it became Vertigo (coincidentally a time when a new restored print of that came out). Apart from the beautiful new print (which I also saw on the big screen), I was probably somewhat also swayed by the Sight & Sound critics poll where Vertigo had just displaced Citizen Kane as the greatest movie of all times.But, for the past ten years or so, North by Northwest has become my favorite Hitchcock movie of all times. It is the one I find myself watching over and over again (just caught it on the big screen, for a change). It is also the one I find myself recommending to others, when they ask what Hitchcock movie should they start with.I guess the reason for this is that it is the most ""perfect"" Hitchcock movie. It has all the elements: the Macguffin, the wrongly-accused leading man, and the blonde woman who may or may not be who she claims to be. More than that, it has in one single movie everything that you will find in separate Hitchcock movies: a great screenplay (by Ernest Lehman), fantastic score (Bernard Herrman, obviously), great title sequence (Saul Bass), crackling dialogue and humor, and great chemistry between the leads (similar to 39 Steps). The interplay between Cary Grant (at his best - and more than Jimmy Stewart, the perfect Hitchcock lead) and Eve Marie Saint when they first meet on the train is an exercise in great writing and acting - it could be from any great romantic movie.But most of all it has some of the great set-pieces assembled in the movies - the crop-dusting and Mount Rushmore sequences are already classics. Yes, it doesn't have the psychological complexity of Vertigo, the shock and horror of Psycho, but it is what it is: the most ENTERTAINING movie that Hitchcock ever made, and the one I can watch over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Music,"This is a great movie and while the direction, locations, acting and editing are fun they are second to one of the best film scores in movie history. Bernard Hermann is a musical master and genius and there has not been anyone before or since that compares to his consistent creativity and this is one of his best. Listen to the music from the first opening credits to the scene on the streets and you will hear some of the best compositions since Stravinsky and Beethoven. (He also did ""Psycho"", ""Twilight Zone"" and so many other fabulous scores.) You may think that John Williams music is great, and he is, including all the latest Harry Potter films, but the only thing that he did that comes close to Bernard Hermann is his music for ET, the motor cycle chase in Indiana Jones III, Duel of the Fates and the Droid battle in Star Wars I. Hans Zimmerman, another great film scorer, has tremndous creativity, often more than John Williams, but anything he did and, for that matter, anyone else to date, has never been better than Bernard Hermann; and this movie is one of his best. An essential ingredient to every great movie is an even better musical score and this one of the best examples of this. Musically, previous to Bernard Hermann was Max Steiner, who wrote the score for ""Gone With The Wind"", and before him was the most creative genius in all of film history, Charles Chaplin (who wrote, directed, acted, and scored all of his films! An unheard of feat these days!). See this movie but also listen to the music and you will hear one the best scores of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock Goes Mainstream,"'North by Northwest' is not as experimental as 'Psycho'. Nor is it as confined as 'Rear Window' or as disturbing as 'Vertigo'. What it is, however, is a mainstream Hitchcock presenting an endlessly entertaining effort. One of the most satisfying spy thrillers, this case of mistaken identity plays out like an intelligent and explosive cat and mouse chase.Hitchcock was always one to maintain tight control over every set, every shot. He loosens his reigns in 'North by Northwest' by making the United States of America his playing field. From New York to Chicago to Mount Rushmore, this captivating thriller is a grandiose and ambitious picture from the master of suspense. The result is a brilliantly realized picture whose entertainment value could rival today's Bond.Cary Grant is electrifying as Roger Thornhill, an unsuspecting man mistaken for a mysterious Kaplan. His journey to keep his life becomes a mad dash to escape the hands of the law, and around every corner Grant faces a looming threat. Eva Marie Saint is fantastic as Grant's romantic interest who has much more invested in Thornhill than he ever suspects. The chemistry between the two is unmistakable, making every twist and turn along the way a brilliant sleight of hand only Hitchcock can deliver.From a heart pounding chase in the middle of a cornfield to a thrilling climax on the face of Mount Rushmore, 'North by Northwest' provides many memorable moments that make this classic a wild ride from start to finish. Sweeping cinematography and vivid imagery only adds to this thrilling, funny, and romantic adventure that span across amber waves of grain and purple mountain majesties. 'North by Northwest' may very well be Hitchcock's most mainstream effort, and you'll savor every moment of it.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not the greatest, but still a good film","Alright so today I watched North by Northwest, my first film from Alfred Hitchcock, but that doesn't matter much as this film is considered to be the most different from his other movies. I'd also say it's one of the lesser acclaimed ones. The plot was always moving along, the characters were interesting, and it had a lot of nice suspense in there. Despite this, the movie felt very long for me. I wasn't necessarily bored, I just wasn't incredibly invested. I'd give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Eva Marie Saint: ""Why did your wives divorce you?"" Cary Grant: ""They said I lived too dull a life""..","I am always amazed at Hitchcock's inventive, resourseful ways. Watch how he uses colour to great effect, as most everything is light blue and white: cars, trains, lighting, etc. to match Cary Grant's shirt and tailored suit. Also, how red appears everytime Grant encounters danger, as when he's abducted in a taxi, a red bus slowly passes by. And at the Mount Rushmore cafe, as Grant slowly walks around the room he passes a man in a red shirt, at the entrance, then a lady with a red blouse cuts in front of him as he buys coffee, and lastly when he sits down right next to a blonde girl in a brilliant red sweater. Of course, he gets shot by Eva Marie Saint a few minutes later. The best is when at the auction, when Grant is avoiding James Mason's henchmen, a red carnation is clearly hovering around his head, convieniantly worn by a lady a few rows in back of him.. Very clever.. As an American actor/ screenwriter who once had the pleasure of working with the lovely, talented Eva Marie Saint, I find this film an all time classic...

Grant and Hitchcock's best collaboration,"Cary Grant is just so darn charming! In everything he does, he creates a memorable character, but none of his roles are better than the ones he has when he works with the great Alfred Hitchcock. North by Northwest is arguably Grant's best role, as well as one of the best from Hitch. It is a case of mistaken identity that leads Roger O. Thornhill, played by Grant, from Manhattan all the way to Mount Rushmore. Two goons are lead to believe that he is a Mr. Kaplan, and this mistake leads Thornhill to a meeting at the United Nations where he is framed for murder.Besides the leading man, the best part of this film is the engaging script. The story came out of a few interesting ideas that Hitchcock wanted to use for a film. A screenwriter was hired to put the scenes together, which is how we get this film that moves quickly and travels through major monuments of the country. In spite of all the fantastic settings, I consider the scene at the auction to be one of the most impressive scenes in the film. Thornhill confronts the villain, Phillip Vandamm, in which neither of them can fight.Eva Marie Saint does a great job as Thornhill's romantic interest with a secret, Eve Kendall. She is a classic Hitchcock female foil, with blond hair and an icy stare. Even before her identity is revealed, the audience senses that she is more than just a woman sitting at a table on a train. The sexual tension between Thornhill and Kendall is palpable in every scene, which makes the finale all the more climactic.I highly recommend this film to anyone. It has action, romance, suspense and humor and is crafted by arguably one of the greatest directors of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the Coolest thriller,"It has the signature of a cool thriller all over it, right from its cool opening credits followed by Hitchcock's cameo. Movie has good background score as always and stylish technical elements. From locations to its camera movements or Cary Grant's drunk driving sequence. Everything stands out. The best thing about the film is its screenplay. It is very exciting and full of twists. I felt surprise at every moment just like Cary Grant's character. Romantic sub-plot isn't as striking as Hitchcock's other films but everything is overshadowed by its engaging story. It is kind of thriller you can watch with ease, it keeps entertaining you. About the cast Cary Grant was quite convincing and so was James Mason. But I really loved Eva Marie Saint. I'm a big fan of her and this time also she stunned me with her fantastic performance. She was just perfect for the role. Such a bold and spellbinding woman. Overall, North by Northwest is one of the coolest thriller I have seen in recent time.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Best Alfred Hitchcock Film,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This was the first Alfred Hitchcock Film I had seen and I am very impressed. Cary Grant and James Mason do a brilliant job and should have got Oscars.

Up And Upwest,"Alfred Hitchcock dished something up more then fifty years ago that would change the way cinema looked today. North By Northwest was that film, and whilst at the time I can only imagine it was fantastical, it still holds up today, trumping most films that come out in the twenty first century. It's fast paced action, it's mystery and twists and turns and all the charm from its actors are what carry this film into cinematic history.North By Northwest is one of the greatest films ever made, both for its historic placement and it's utterly great story. It proves to be something more then a film, it's more of an adventure for the audience; we travel with Roger through this fantastic thriller, becoming apart of his venture. Possibly the greatest action adventure film ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Frankly, my dear, it's disappointing","What I liked: The acting was good. Some of the dialogue was good. The Mt. Rushmore shots were fun, by and large, and the final shot of the train barreling into a tunnel is just too hilariously suggestive not to like. What I didn't like: well, there sure are a lot of far-fetched a-goin's on, aren't there? Thornhill does precious little objecting in regards to his kidnapping. And attempting to get rid of Kaplan by pouring bourbon down his gullet and crashing a car? That's the best they can do? And Vandamm and company simply commandeer the Townsend manse? Is it that easy to do, to just waltz into the home of UN diplomat and take it over? Thornhill gets on the train to Chicago without a ticket too easily. And why not just do a drive-by while Thornhill is waiting in that Indiana cornfield? Killing him from a plane is easier than that? And the final sequence of switching from the scene with Eve dangling from Mt. Rushmore, to Thornhill pulling Eve up into bed - at first I thought it was awfully hokey. But I can also see another side to it: Hitchcock perhaps snubbing his nose at the usual damsel in distress being saved finale that everyone was expecting. Oh, and the laughter of everyone in that elevator to the line ""You aren't really trying to kill my son, are you?"" was bizarre and nonsensical.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
groundbreakingly gripping,"Ever notice how Oprah is trying to pile great life-changing TV-moments on top of one another, time after time? This is exactly what Hitchkock was doing for cinema. The great thing about North by Northwest though, is that he's trying to do it all in one movie.I challenge the reader to name any other title that has so many groundbreaking suspense scenes: the abduction, the drunk driving, the UN-building scene (He has the knife: he's the killer!- oh no!-the paranoia!), the crop duster-scene, the crazy auction (Cary Grant bidding ridiculously high and then claiming the crap isn't worth a buck) and of course the very slow and gripping Mount Rushmore chase-scene.Watching this movie today, it feels easily as fast-paced and gripping as, say, Casino Royale or MI3. It's not overstating to claim that this movie is, in fact, the first Bond(-type) movie, still waiting to be topped.Of course, you have to love Cary Grant, you have to love Technicolor, you have to love the now firmly outdated cardboard characters. If you don't, it's your loss; I beg you: get over yourself!(you don't have to love Oprah) Having said this, I would like to end saluting Eve Kendall and Cary Grant: a match made in heaven. This may not be Hitchcock's finest film, but I think these are his finest leading actors. Eve Kendall is everything you want from a Hitchkock-lady. Women who, under the pretense of ladylikeness, are in fact a tad trashy. So matching the fifties.And Grant is the ideal Hitch-hero: fragile yet masculine, dull, but somehow fascinating.Go watch!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It has its points of interest, but any 60's Bond flick is a better choice","When an ad executive in Manhattan (Gary Cooper) is mistaken for a government agent by a foreign spy & his cronies (James Mason, et al.) he finds himself a fugitive traveling by train to Chicago wherein he meets a woman that seems to have his favor (Eva Marie Saint). After a curious encounter with a crop dusting plane everything culminates at Mount Rushmore, South Dakota.""North by Northwest"" (1959) is an adventure/thriller by Hitchcock with a huge reputation. It obviously influenced the James Bond flicks of the 60s, which started three years later with ""Dr. No"" (1962), but it's very toned down by comparison because the hero in this case is not a trained spy. It's entertaining to a point, but also seriously overrated due to some glaring problems...Jessie Royce Landis plays the protagonist's mother when she was only a little over 7 years older than Cooper and it's too obvious; the story drags too much at this point (when he's hanging out with his mother); his chance meeting with a key character on the train (Saint) is too coincidental; their make-out sessions are premature, unconvincing and painfully dull; what happens to the plane is stupefying; the crop dusting encounter supposedly takes place in rural Indiana when it's clear that it's nowhere within a thousand miles of Indiana (actually it was shot at the southern end of Central Valley, California, outside of Bakersfield); speaking of which, the geography is too noticeably disingenuous: e.g. during the drunk driving episode there are no cliffs like that on Long Island (it was actually shot at Potrero Valley, Thousand Oaks, CA, and obviously so).Still, there's enough good here to enjoy if you favor Hitchcock & the cast and don't mind quaint movies.The film runs 2 hours, 15 minutes (unnecessarily overlong).GRADE: B-/C+",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Old equals good?,"One of the big IL' movies. Hitchcock. Cary Grant. 8.6 here at IMDb! This move, along with a lot of other ""golden oldies"", are given much too high ratings at IMDb. I argue that the reason for this over rating is that people review movies as if it was sports and not art. Let me explain ;) When you review a world cup soccer match from the 50:s you must take into consideration that the game was much slower, the tactics simple, and that the players were not very well trained, compared to today that is. The world cup final between West Germany and Hungary in 1954 was top quality entertainment, performed by world class artists, if you looked at it 1954. If you look at it today the first thing that strikes you is how much everything has improved. Put simply,the world cup winners of 1954 would not win one match in any division two series in Europe today. But still we can look at the cup final from -54 and say, yeah that was a great game, considering it was played 50 years ago. With art, it's another story. You don't consider, or rather, shouldn't consider, age as a factor. You won't hear anyone say - Yeah, Picasso painted some good shiit back in his days, but he could never compete with today's artists. The same goes for Mozart, Beethoven, Leonardo, Michelangelo etc etc. My argument is that the movie art should be treated as any other art form.Let's apply this to the movie in question. Acting: I would like anyone that gave this movie a rating over 6-7 to look at the car chase scene one more time and tell me what they think of Cary Grants acting in that scene. I can tell you all that one of my friends, at age 15, acted drunk better than old Cary did here. (And nobody even believed that my friend was drunk.) It pisses me off when someone says that the acting is superb in this movie. It is an insult to all actors of today.Plot: I won't bore you with an analysis. Lets just state that the plot is unbelievable and some scenes ridiculous.Script: Hitchcock is said to be the master of suspense. In North by Northwest the suspense level is so low that not even a ten year old would get a pulse from watching it. The dialogue is however smart and funny.Conclusion: Bad acting. Unbelievable plot. Pretty funny. Extremely overrated. 4/10. If you are hungry for a Hitchcock flick, watch Rear window instead.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Classic Hitch.,"A classic film of a classic 'Hitchcockian' case of mistaken identity, this is essentially a remake of THE 39 STEPS - but considerably expanded to make use of glorious technicolour and to emphasize the paranoia that can develop from a man feeling pushed to his very limit by events and circumstances maliciously controlled by others. As usual, Hitch has a cameo in his own film: #Man Missing Departing Bus, at the very beginning!Overgrown mummy's boy but successful advertizing executive Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for 'George Kaplan,' a CIA-created 'legend' (the intelligence community's jargon for the name and biography invented to hide operatives' real identities) designed to decoy Van Dam (James Mason), agent provocateur of an unspecified foreign power, away from their genuine agent's activities. To prove his innocence, Fairburn must be 'Kaplan' so as to draw Van Dam and his men out and expose them. Nevertheless, 'the memorable scenes' are indeed memorable: the cropduster and the dénoument dangling off Mount Rushmore.Glamour is provided by the very fine Eve Marie-Saint, who demonstrates that 'they just don't make 'em like they used to' ... women simply do not have that glamorous mystique anymore (nor do cameramen have soft-focus lenses, apparently); nowadays, what you see is what you get: very little subtlety, but a lot of bare flesh and squelchy kissing. Come on, film-makers, do leave us something to the imagination - that's what the nickelodeon chaps made films to be all about, remember!I first saw this film when I was 13, in a hotel in St. Dogmaels in Wales. A boy & girl combo came into the TV room and the film managed to desist their squelchy kissing. An elderly couple entered during the ad-break and the chap rather pompously asked if we could switch over for The News. The rest of us thereupon trooped down to the cellar-room, where, unheated (this was still Britain in the 1970s), the remainder of the film was viewed and thoroughly enjoyed. In fact, the cold probably added to the film's atmosphere ...Stalwart and calm Leo G. Carroll, the 'professor,' played this same sort of rôle again the followed decade, as 'General Waverley,' stalwart and calm commander of the United Network for Communications & Law Enforcement - ""When one has manners, one need never apologize ...""

MR. THORNHILL'S INTERESTING WEEK...,"There's a heck of a lot of debate over NORTH BY NORTHWEST as to where it stands among Hitchcock's greatest films. A multitude of classic scenes that have gone on to be Hollywood legend. That much we all can agree on.A gemstone of a movie, meticulously assembled and cast by the master of suspense, an inspiration to present and future film makers. Best thing about any of Hitch's productions is the storyline, generally pitting the main character against all odds and just watching what happens next... In this case, Cary Grant is mistaken, rather simply --if not humorously -- as a gentleman who some international spies are very much interested in. The rest is up to him to prove otherwise and hopefully survive the ordeal.Dark comedy at its best with some excellent characters to give him a run for his money. James Mason co-stars as Grant's unrelenting adversary, and lovely Eva Marie Saint plays the ""mystery woman"" with a few skeletons in her own closet, perhaps needing him more than he needs her.Complicated, yes, but entertaining. Notably, and as can be expected, there are a few outstanding supporting roles; Jessie Royce Landis playing Grant's wise-cracking mom, still treating him as if he were in high school. Martin Landau is spot on as a cold-blooded associate of Mason's (who you know is going to get his!) and Leo G. Carroll as the ace man with a plan.For architechts and art lovers, the house on the edge of the hill is a dream. Just love those huge support beams and the long gravel driveway up to the place. Stunning. Don't forget that classic '59 white Lincoln.After decades of watching this adventure, the cornfield chase scene is still a knockout and one you never ever get tired of, particularly Grant's arrival, stepping off a bus in the middle of nowhere. Hitchcock got it just right and that about sums it all up. One for the film history books.Bernard Herrmann's music score, once again a star in its own right.

Fine suspense triller with some iconic moments,"Pretty much everything you want from a Hitchcock movie is here in North by Northwest.A great plot, interesting twists, suspense, good vs evil, strong characters, fine acting, sharp dialogue, humour - plus the almost obligatory blonde, and a bossy meddling mum for good measure. All wrapped up in a well paced and entertaining film.Cary Grant takes the lead role, as Roger Thornhill - an innocent man minding his own business who is mistaken for secret agent George Kaplan and finds himself the enemy of a spy ring. He's soon in trouble not only with the mobs, but the police as well.We follow Thornhill as he tries to stay one step ahead of his adversaries, while at the same time trying to prove his real identity. Along the way he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) and becomes even more entangled in a web of deceit and double identities.There are some truly iconic film scenes - none better perhaps than the 'crop dusting' scene where Thornhill fights for his life at a remote and dusty crossroad - but these are more than matched by the film's lower key moments. The script is really on point, ensuring that a simple conversation in a train is just as engrossing as the more ambitious set pieces.This is one of Hitchcock's more ambitious films - in terms of scale and grandeur - and he succeeds in delivering fine entertainment while retaining many of the subtleties essential to his films.Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Even Eva Marie Saint seems to relax here (she's quite sexy and saucy; her best line--an early one aboard the train about making love on an empty stomach--got dubbed over, which hopefully will be corrected someday).

"137 minutes of ""Huh?""","Had I been alive in 1959 and capable of seeing ""North by Northwest,"" I probably would have gotten up and left the theater halfway through--not because it's a poorly made film, but because it exists, to this day, for no other purpose than to jerk the viewer around to the point of cold indifference.Alfred Hitchcock enjoyed playing his audience like a piano, and while I have no problem with that, all his notes are out of tune here. One part vanity piece, one part spy thriller, ""North by Northwest"" has innocent Everyman Cary Grant on the run after being framed for a diplomat's murder; Eva Marie Saint is the femme fatale who may or may not be playing both sides; and James Mason is some sort of vaguely-defined heavy masterminding everything. Unlike Anthony Perkins in ""Psycho"" or Jon Finch in ""Frenzy,"" Grant is filled with too much winking, boyish charm to ever convey a sense of consequence for his character; Marie Saint is presented as more of a plot device than a character; and Mason brings a fair amount of class to his limited scenes.Maybe I was expecting something different, and therefore kept waiting for ""North by Northwest"" to turn into the tense, gripping thriller it has been hailed as. Ultimately, only a director with Hitchcock's pedigree could get away with a project so flagrantly self-indulgent and impossibly plotted and still earn a slew of sycophantic raves. Perhaps I took it too seriously, but ""North by Northwest"" is an incredibly empty romp that's high on style, but precious little else.4.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is one of the best films in his long and distinguished career. Part of the success of the movie lies in the screen play by Ernest Lehman, one of the best writers of that era. Also, the haunting music by Mr. Hitchcock's usual collaborator, Bernard Hermann, adds texture to what we are seeing. Together with all the above mentioned qualities, ""North by Northwest"" was photographed by Robert Burks and was edited by George Tomasini, both men did outstanding jobs to enhance a film that shows a mature and inspired Alfred Hitchcock.The film works because of the witty dialog Mr. Lehman wrote. This has to be one of the riskiest projects undertaken by Mr. Hitchcock because of the sexiness Eva Kendall exudes throughout the film and the repartee between her and Roger Thornhill. The film mixes adventure and romance that aren't put ons, as one feels what one's watching to be really happening.Much has been said in this forum as to the values of this classic, so we shall only add our pleasure in seeing this masterpiece any time it turns on cable. In fact, the film hasn't dated, the way some others of the same period have.

Greatest Hitchcock Movie EVER!!,"I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie.  This movie has everything.  It has action, drama, comedy, lively music(thank you Bernard Herrmann), great costumes(thank you Edith Head), and of course outstanding performances not only by Hitch in directing, but in acting with Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Jessie Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll(He was in every Hitch movie it seemed), and Martin Landau(in his first film role--he was brilliant as Leonard).  I love the way Cary Grant says things in such a deadpan way like when he says early in the movie, ""Don't tell me where we going, surprise me!""  Although long, you will not be bored for a single second.  It is really hard for me to believe that Ben-Hur was that great. This movie should have won several oscars.  The end is very memorable as well although I won't give it away.  This movie had several memorable scenes although without question Cary Grant running from the plane is probably the most famous and one of the most famous in all of movies.  One curious note is that Jessie Royce Landis, who also appeared with Grant in To Catch a Thief, plays Grant's mother although Grant is 10 months older than her! Also, make sure you pay attention to the kid in the cafeteria who sticks his fingers in his ears a tad too early!  It is a shame that when people mention Hitchcock's name, they think of the horror stuff like Psycho or The Birds or they think of the taut thrillers like Vertigo or Rear Window.  Not that there is anything wrong with these movies, it is just that nobody thinks he can direct such a non-stop action picture like this.  It may have been the most atypical Hitch movie ever in terms of style, but I feel it is his greatest ever.  If you have never seen this movie, you got to go see it now--you'll be glad that you did.

Great film,"""North by Northwest"" from 1959, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is a masterful blend of suspense, action, humor and adventure, featuring Cary Grant in one of his most iconic roles as Roger Thornhill, a charming advertising executive who is mistaken for a government agent and embroiled in a dangerous conspiracy. Grant's performance is complemented by Eva Marie Saint as the lovely but enigmatic Eve Kendall, while James Mason plays the calculating villain Phillip Vandamm with a chilling restraint. The supporting cast includes Jessie Royce Landis as Thornhill's sharp-witted mother, and Martin Landau as Vandamm's sinister henchman, Leonard. The film's stunning cinematography by Robert Burks showcases breathtaking locations, including the dizzying heights of Mount Rushmore, where one of the most famous sequences takes place. Bernard Herrmann's score is arguably his best, expertly enhancing the tension, with its dramatic brass and strings, adding an unmistakable pulse to the film's atmosphere. Shot on location across the United States, including the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York and the rolling landscapes of the Midwest, this is a real treat that employs Hitchcock's trademark use of suspenseful set pieces, including the iconic crop duster scene. The film also represents a technical triumph, as it pioneered several groundbreaking cinematic techniques, including the use of the now-legendary ""wrong man"" motif. The famous opening title sequence, designed by Saul Bass, was one of the first to feature abstract imagery and was groundbreaking in its visual approach. Hitchcock also made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence, and the film's dynamic pace and razor-sharp dialogue set it apart as a quintessential example of mid-century American cinema.

That crop scene...,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's Hitchcock movie review Is North By Northwest (1959), an action thriller where we the story has the same elements as previous Hitchcock flicks - an advertising executive gets mixed up as a wrong man and soon is accused of a crime he did not commit. This New York executive is Roger Thornhill, played brilliantly by the suave Cary Grant. Thornhill is pursued by a pack of thugs after he is mistaken for a government agent spy known as George Kaplan and we movie goers found ourselves on a cross-country journey. But the question begins on who really is Kaplan and maybe Thornhill is Kaplan?The story of the movie is smart by keeping you on the edge, constantly giving us guessing games yet provides you a few answers here and there in a timely fashion while providing you a comic, adventure-caper type flick. And that is what Hitchcock does very well in this entertaining suspenseful flick, he balances out between seriousness and silliness. All this is largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant who not just plays your everyday man but also gives you his trademark jerky movements and exasperated facial expressions. Whether Grant is forced drunk and driving a car to get away from the goons while trying to avoid driving over the cliff's edge, or his expression when his mother asks the would-be assassin whether they want to kill his son which leads to the other people in the lift laughing hysterical - you see his expressions that summarises the film's atmosphere while beginning to question whether this bloke is who he says he is. It flirts with the idea of identity.The plot's MacGuffin allows the Thornhill to move seamlessly across iconic American landscapes by means of plane, train and automobile. There are so many great and iconic scenes in this film - the crop duster chase of course and also those at the United Nations and Mount Rushmore. Coming to the that crop duster scene...before this scene we see a man who comes across as slightly clumsy and under his mother's thumb, but he evolves once it is clear that he's been marked and is a target for a sinister plot. So what happens? He becomes more assertive in taking matters into his own hands.The crop duster scene...have to chat about it folks. As soon as Thornhill is off the bus, stood in the middle of nowhere, the music stops. The audience is alone with him in the vast space of this landscape which is in the middle of no where, which is a clever decision made by Hitchcock as it effectively boxes the character in with four shots; an invisible wall. And then you have the crop duster plane...what happens is a game of cat-and-mouse. When the plane turns its attentions towards him and attack and when Grant turns to the camera with the stuttered movements, you see his survival instinct kicking in is one of Hitchcock's strongest moments. Grant's performance is perfect in his change of running style. Throughout the film, his run has still been comedic, lanky, wide-eyed. Here it is an expression of bare-faced fear as he runs and takes brief cover in a crop. I wont tell you what happens next but wow oh wow.Another great element in this flick is Hitch's musical maestro partner, Bernard Herrmann whose score drives the flick's constant momentum. Smart as it reflects the tone of the flick. The femme fatale played by Eva Marie Sant is performed brilliantly as this alluring woman with a dubious and enigmatic nature - again you question who is she really?? I could literally chat about this flick on and on - do yourself a favour a have a crack, overall 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cary Grant made a great involuntary James Bond,"When seeing an older ""classic"" film for the first time, it is difficult to not see the many films and genders it influenced. Purchased the DVD because it was rated so highly on IMDb and was on sale. Time hasn't deteriorated this gem too much, at least where it counted in the performances of Cary Grant and Eve Marie Saint. This classy duo and their coming together seemed to be a Bond film in the making. And despite the espionage element, it was the humor and double entendre dialog that carried the action. The espionage in itself, didn't age well, but knowing the actors James Mason and Martin Landau, added some recognition excitement where the fake sets failed to stir a reaction. ""Roger... Pay the two dollars.""",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What is this doing in the top 250 films,"This film is a poor mans James Bond. Hitchcock might be the master of suspense but he sure ain't the master of spy thrillers as this film goes from bad to worse. This may have been mildly interesting in the fifties/sixties, however a modern viewer must find this film very boring. This has no place in the top 250, let alone the top 20.

Iconic Action Thriller,"North by Northwest: The feeling I got during North by Northwest initially wasn't a great one. I couldn't focus on what was being shown to me on the screen, something about the story was off-putting, even the directing didn't settle with me at first. Once I relaxed into my chair and gave it a go, I had no regrets and enjoyed myself. As I watched it I realized how much of an impact this single movie had on the industry at the time of its release. Some of the stunts are incredible and the magnitude is just bigger and better than what was in movies at that time. It's Hitchcock's biggest film; it's not bloated, but it covers the territory necessary to best an iconic action thriller. Hitchcock stages everything well here, making the action feel innocent enough to not fall into the ""Action Movie"" stereotypes of today clichéd blockbusters. The roots of the action pieces are in suspense and timing. North by Northwest had great scope with unexpected instruments in the plot to further the film.Rating: AGrade: 9/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
One curve ball after another just doesn't give this movie a chance to be boring.,"This movie is great because for the majority of its run we know just as much as our protagonist, Roger Thornhill, played by the late Cary Grant. Finding out bits of information while great action instances, saboteur plots, and plot twists lead us by the hand makes the movie feel really fresh as it flows like a smooth river, taking us unexpected turns along the way. The juxtaposition between Mr. Thornhill not understanding what the hell is going on and dealing with the situation like an experienced spy is a joy to watch and experience as Cary Glant's performance is exceptionally good. I praised movie from this era for having wonderful dialogues before and the witty remarks Mr. Thornhill throws out every other scene is no exception - he uses words to great effect and when you add Eve Kendall, played by Eva Marie Saint (who is still kicking and is three years away from turning 100 years old), to the mix, you get the James-Bond like charisma before James Bond and Bond girls even appeared on the big screen. Overall, Albert Hitchcock did a marvelous job creating a confusing situation that only got better by the minute, and let's take a moment to appreciate his little cameo in the movie too.It's no surprise that I really enjoyed the movie. It makes me want to watch the original James Bond movies from the '60s and see how they did spy thrillers back then. If they're at least half-as-smartly written and witty as North by Northwest, I'm going to have a good time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
My personal favorite of Hitchcock's films!,"It's all too simple really.  Hitchcock used this plot device before in many of his films; the innocent man caught up in circumstances beyond his control (""The Wrong Man"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"").  However, never will you see Hitchcock use this device more cleverly and stylishly as in ""North By Northwest.""Cary Grant plays the innocent man like, well, Cary Grant.  Add James Mason as the villain (Mason has a great voice... close your eyes sometimes when watching...chilling!), Martin Landau as his henchman, and Eva Marie Saint as the cool blonde equals a great film.What other Hitchcock film can boast of not one but two famous suspense scenes?  Cary Grant being chased down by a dustcropper will be talked about and studied in film schools for years to come.  The chase across Mt. Rushmore is a perfect way to climax the film as well...There are smaller things to look for too.  Watch for the famous kid in the snack shop who covers his ears seconds before a gun is shot and why did Hitchcock use THAT image over ""The End""??? Hehehe...",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Well done Mr. Hitchcock!,The only negatives that I have with the film are how abruptly it ended and how it lacked showing the main character's life coming back together after his whole ordeal/adventure.

"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" (1959)","In Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" (1959), Hitchcock's creates possibly his most unique film to date. At the time, Hitchcock's films, while great, were beginning to be considered a little stale and repetitive. That is, until ""North by Northwest"" (1959). In this film, many different genres come together to create a film that goes down as one of the all time classics.

Another Hitchcock Masterpiece,"Very few movies have reached the level of sophistication found in Hitchcock's masterpiece North By Northwest.  Many critics believe, myself included, that the entire James Bond series owes a debt to North by Northwest for showing the way to make a spy themed story with a bit of the tongue in cheek.  However, no Bond film comes close to North by Northwest for brilliance and sheer thrills.This movie is epic in scope and you can feel it the second the opening titles begin.  It starts at a kinetic pace and never lets up.  Many before me have described the plot outline so without rehashing, let me just say that believability is not the movie's strong suit.  In fact, it is about as ridiculous a storyline as you can imagine.  That's not the point.  The experience, the rollercoaster of an adventure it takes you on -- as so many great Hitchcock pictures -- is the point.  If you haven't seen this picture, you are in for a real treat.

North by Northwest,"""Thornhill"" (Cary Grant) is your typically fast-talking advertising executive who is meeting some folks for a drink when he is mistaken for a ""Mr. Caplan"". Whisked off at gunpoint to meet ""Vandamm"" (James Mason) and his henchman ""Leonard"" (Martin Landau) his protestations of innocence just get him pumped full of booze and put behind the wheel of a car, the likely suspect of a murder investigation. He has to stay one step ahead of the pursuing police now as he tries to get his life back, a task made more difficult by his encounter with the charmingly enigmatic ""Eve"" (a rather static Eva Marie Saint) whom he is not entirely sure he can trust. What Hitchcock delivers now is a slowly unravelling adventure mystery with loads of red herrings, plenty of well written and executed humour from Grant and a gradually accruing sense of menace as we finally realise just what is going on. The photography is intimate one moment, all-encompassing the next, the crop dusting scene is the stuff of cinema legend and I challenge any non-American to name the fourth bloke atop Mount Rushmore at the end. To be fair, that denouement wasn't my favourite - it's a bit rushed and rather convenient, but this is still a stylishly produced thriller, with an exciting score from Bernard Herrmann that still stands the test of time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Master at the top of his game.,"For those who love Hitchcock, this is the pinnacle of the Master's power. A story written to specifically be the ultimate ""Hitch"" film.

Great,"North By Northwest (1959)**** (out of 4)Cary Grant has the police and killers chasing him from NY to Chicago to Mount Rushmore in this Alfred Hitchcock classic that's certainly among his best films. I'd probably put this at #5 on my list. I personally see this as a greatest hits collection from Hitchcock and it's certainly one of the greatest adventure films out there. Grant is amazing in the role and nails the comedy and delivers in the action scenes. I didn't really warm up to Grant until last year but he's quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. The grace he shows floating from scene to scene is great to watch and that British humor comes off perfectly in the film. James Mason and Martin Landau are great as well.Once again I was at the Louisville Palace to see this with a crowd of over 2300 people!!!! The first showing had around that number as well so I'm sure the manager is very happy as well. I have a certain friend who can identify himself if he wishes that says younger folks don't enjoy these older films but you certainly wouldn't be able to tell that from these screenings. Black, white, young, old and even a blind person was in attendance, which is great to see. What I really love about seeing older films in theaters is those there seeing it for the first time.

Very entertaining,"A hapless New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies, and is pursued across the country while he looks for a way to survive.Quite reminiscent of Hitchcock's own The 39 Steps, though this one's on a much greater scale. It's a bit of a messy film, and maybe also a tad formulaic, but it's a lot of fun to watch, and is probably one of Hitchcock's most entertaining movies.

North by Northwest,"Pure movie magic: Hitchcock at his pulpiest, an exercise in sheer entertainment. Comparisons to James Bond here are not just pertinent in regards to the genre and characters, but all the more so in style - this exists on the same plane as Raiders of the Lost Ark in its elevation from any semblance of reality. On this level, Thornhill being forced to drink a bottle of bourbon and then to drive a stolen vehicle is not out of the ordinary. A plan to kill him involving a deserted road and a crop duster is perfectly logical. His dialogue with Eve Kendall, mostly consisting of explicit innuendo, is completely natural in this heightened world exclusive to films. Led by a charming Cary Grant performance, an ecstatic Bernard Hermann score, and plenty of Alfred Hitchcock's visual flair, North by Northwest is designed solely as a moviegoing experience. At 136 minutes, this lacks the sleekness of his earlier spy capers (e.g. The 39 Steps) but more than makes up for it in craft. Any pacing issues in the second act - and occasional instances of clunky exposition - are paid back tenfold with a dazzling final half-hour. A suffocating masterwork of suspense in Vandamm's house (note the ""fake gun"" reveal used here, successfully, *three* times), an iconic chase scene down Mount Rushmore, and a sudden cut so perfectly suited to the tone that one smiles just thinking of it. And, of course, that marvellous final shot. A climax indeed. This may not be as artful or as flawlessly executed as some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, but I'll be damned if it isn't his most fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
North by Northwest,"North by Northwest is a sharp and diverse film, and one of my favorites I've seen from Hitchcock so far. Hitchcock incorporated comedy, action, and romance, with a heavy dose of action. He transfers between scenes very smoothly, and he seems to cut at just the right moment. The cinematography uses lots of zooming shoots, that come into focus on one thing. One of my favorite shots of he film was when the main character was walking through a packed train station. Even though there were tons of other people, the camera seemed to track the main character perfectly so you stayed focused on him.

ahead of its time,"It's interesting for a younger generation to watch movies such as ""North by Northwest"" to see just how much recent movies rip off original ideas.""North by Northwest"" is a spectacular suspense movie (I would not classify it as a thriller or action), with a keen script and even keener delivery of the lines. Cary Grant is commanding in his role as a fugitive from the law, while Eva Marie Grant is captivating as the femme fatale.I did have my problems with the film. As with most movies of the period, it dragged on at points. While Grant and Saint have a nice on-screen chemistry, Hitchcock at times dwells too much on the duo and not enough on the intriguing storyline.Plus, the movie has unnecessary exposition. There is a lot of emphasis on making the viewer realize Grant's character is a fast-thinking businessman at the opening of the movie, but the story never gets back to that. Grant's character never really has the chance to evolve, he just simply changes.But overall, this movie triumphs because of the pace at which the viewer learns interesting details. Unlike most current Hollywood flicks in which the viewer has to wait until the end to learn anything (and the rest of the movie is spent trying to guess its secrets), ""North by Northwest"" lays down all its cards well before the movie's climax.

perhaps the greatest Hitchcock movie ever,"Having just received the DVD for my birthday, I have spent many hours watching this classic movie.  Listening to the ""making of"" documentary and the commentary by Ernest Lehman dubbed over the movie it is hard to believe that this film was largely forgotten because of the new wave of action movies ie Mr Connery and friends.  Even though nearly every secret is revealed on the DVD, this only helps to enhance the impact of every scene and visual.  Incredibly, Ernest Lehman did not know how to end the movie at Mount Rushmore until he came up with the idea that Eve shots Roger in the dining room area.  Cherish every scene and every line of dialogue as Cary Grant delivers some very funny lines at the expense of the bad guys.  By the way, it's true, Martin Landau was a very strange looking guy at the time and an absolute perfect piece of casting in the role of the sinister and some would say homosexual Leonard.  The very last ""train zooming into a tunnel"" scene may be a little corny, but you've probably had enough suspense (in the cornfield?) thanks to Hitch and Bernard Hermann's rousing score (that tune just gets to you after a while).Sit back and enjoy the master at work.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

North by Northwest,"Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest is regarded as laying the footprints for the modern spy action thrillers such as James Bond.The movie is well known for its iconic action scenes. Cary Grant being chased by a crop duster plane and the scenes on Mount Rushmore.Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is a suave advertising executive in New York who gets mistaken for George Kaplan during the cold war.The villains who trade in secrets with a foreign power want to kill Kaplan. The trouble for Thornhill is that Kaplan is a made up operative. He has been created to expose the bad guys led by smooth but deadly Phillip Vandamm (James Mason.)After a death at the UN building, Thornhill is wanted for murder and is on the run. On a train he meets Eve (Eva-Marie Saint) who helps him out but she seems to have her own agenda.Thornhill has no idea what is going on, why the villains are trying to kill him and what is Eve up to.If you actually miss the early portion of the film and see the scenes between Thornhill and Eve. You would think you have walked into a romantic comedy rather than an espionage thriller.North by Northwest effortless switches genres to take advantage of Grant's forte for light comedy. At its heart, this is an escapist action movie.The villains motives though seem hazy. While Vandamm is urbane, his henchman Leonard (Martin Landau) hiding a gay subtext is chillingly cold. They go through some convoluted lengths to finish off Thornhill. Maybe this was another inspiration for the Bond movies.The Professor (Leo G Carroll) tries to provide an explanation as to what is going on. MGM the studio who made this film were right. The film is too long and needed some judicious snipping. There is too much blue screen, at one point during the train journey the background is in sepia.

Doesn't live up to the expectation,"North By Northwest starts pretty well: it's intriguing, tense, captivating. Not for long unfortunately, because after barely about 30 minutes, the pace, suspense, tension, drop significantly and the movie becomes totally convenient and linear until the final outcome.Hitchcock piles up overlong passages such as the train trip and the romance between Roger and Eve that seemed endless, and questionable ideas like the plane scene or the final chase at Mount Rushmore, unrealistic and ending the film in the most abrupt way. And that is only a small part of the conveniences and incoherences that badly discredit the script.Under these circumstances, how can this movie be considered an all time classic ? Yes, the direction and mise-en-scène are good, if you put aside the dated special effects and extensive use of matte paintings, but that hardly compensates for a mediocre scenario.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""How does a girl like you get to be a girl like you?""","I'd like to kick myself in the seat of the pants for just now getting around to watching North By Northwest. I've been meaning to sit down with it for years and finally got around to it this week. It's a case of too many movies and too little time. Anyway, what a treat! It's Alfred Hitchcock and Carey Grant doing what they do best and treating us to one of the most entertaining pieces of film I've ever seen. I don't throw 10/10 ratings around like candy. Over the years, I've taken the time to rate 2,575 entries on IMDb. Of those, I've only given 52 (well, now 53) 10/10 ratings. To me, a movie has to be really special to deserve a 10. And North By Northwest is a very special movie.I've read more than a few of the North By Northwest reviews on IMDb and many cover the positive aspects of the movie much better and more intelligently than I ever could. Instead of trying to write a real review, I'm just gong to make a few comments on the film:1. I've read a few reviews that complain about the unrealistic aspects and situations in the movie. I hope no one thinks that Hitchcock was ever going for a realistic look at crime. In an interview I read, he calls the movie, ""A fantasy of the absurd"". I'd call it a PERFECT fantasy of the absurd. The movie flawlessly mixes action, suspense, and comedy to create a wonderfully entertaining experience. And as I've said any number of times, I watch movies to be entertained.2. Apparently, Hitchcock selected Grant in the lead over James Stewart. No offense meant to Stewart, but I cannot imagine anyone in the Thornhill role other than Grant. His comedic touch, mixed with his good looks, his acting ability, and his ability to play a put-upon wrong man type role make him ideal. He may not have been the ""everyman"" Stewart was, but there's still something in his character that makes him eminently relatable.3. Like any movie fan, I was aware of the crop duster scene. It's an iconic movie moment that has transcended the movie. And it's just as good as I could have hoped. But I wasn't aware of the auction scene. That has to be one of the best moments I've experienced in a movie. It's just so perfect.4. As much as I enjoyed North By Northwest, there are a few moments that, if they could be changed, the movie would have been even better. Chief among these is the scene fairly early on in the movie where The Professor and his cronies are sitting around a table, discussing the Thronhill situation. I feel they give away too much of the plot's twists too soon. I would have preferred to have discovered George Kaplan's secret when Thornhill does. Playing along with the character might have made a fantastic movie even better.I'll stop. I could literally write pages. I'll sum it all up by saying that if you've never seen North By Northwest, do yourself a favor and check it out. It's not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock's most iconic film,"In a case of mistaken identity, a harmless New York advertising man, Roger Thornhill, becomes the target of foreign agents. After trying to kill him they frame him for murder. He escapes the police net by boarding a train bound for Chicago. On the train he meets beautiful, mysterious blonde, Eve Kendall, who helps him escape. He's still not safe though.Possibly Alfred Hitchcock's most iconic movie. Not his best movie - that honour goes to either Rebecca, Rear Window or Psycho, in my opinion - but it contains some of his most indelible scenes - Cary Grant running from the plane, Mount Rushmore, to name but two.It's not all about memorable scenes though. The plot is quite intriguing and interesting, though maybe a bit too convoluted for its own good.Hitchcock's employs his usual tension-building tricks to great effect and actually outdoes himself in that respect as the complexity of the plot can make things quite confusing at times, limiting the tension. In spite of this Hitchcock whisks you along for the ride, whether you understand everything that is going along or not.Cary Grant is great as Roger Thornhill, delivering his lines with his usual charm, wry humour and crispness. Eva Marie Saint is great as Eve Kendall and doesn't take a back seat to Grant.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sometimes the truth does taste like a mouthful of worms.,"Roger O Thornhill is a harmless and amiable advertising executive who is absurdly mistaken for a government agent by a gang of ruthless spies. Forced to go out on the lam, Thornhill lurches from one perilous scenario to another. Can he survive to prove his innocence? Is the gorgeous blonde who is helping him really a friend? All will be revealed in Alfred Hitchcock's majestic thriller.If deconstructing it you find that this isn't a perfect Hitchcock movie, for it under uses James Mason's coolly vile Phillip Vandamm (which is a crime), and it also doesn't have a female lead acting with any great urgency since Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall fails to fully fulfil the promise of Kendall's arrival in the movie. Yet this film rightly earns the right to be on any critics top 100 list, to be a favourite amongst the legion of Hitchcock fans (of which I'm one of that number), for it is escapist entertainment in its purest form, Hitchcock's most accessible popcorn entertainment piece.From the moment at the film's opening when you hear Bernard Herrmann's wonderful music, it's enough to send goose pimples all over the body. For it is a musical portent that signifies we are about to get a fusion of thrills, mystery, and some cheeky Hitchcock humour, accompanied by heroes and villains all condensed purely for our enjoyment. Fronted by a diamond Cary Grant performance as the man wrongly mistaken for another that leads to him being pursued frighteningly across the states, the pic is never found wanting for genre high points. Coming as it did after the darkly brilliant and soul sapping Vertigo, Hitchcock clearly wanted to hang loose and enjoy himself.Working from a fabulous script by Ernest Lehman, North By Northwest's very reason for being is purely to entertain those wanting to invest a frame of mind with it, with Hitchcock cunningly putting us on side with what is ultimately a shallow character in Grant's Roger O (the O doesn't stand for anything) Thornhill. It's a neat trick from the master of trickery and devilment. Some of the scenes on show are now almost folk lore such is the esteem in which they are held by movie fans and makers alike. A crop dusting aeroplane attack (the prelude to which has those goose pimples popping up in anticipation), a pursuit on Mount Rushmore and the often forgotten drunk car on a cliff sequence, these are all trade mark pieces of work from Hitchcock.North By Northwest is in my humble opinion one of the true greats of cinema history, where as bleak and as unnervingly brilliant as Vertigo was the previous year, this is the polar opposite in structure and fable, but the result is most definitely equally as great. One of the reasons I fell in love with cinema in fact. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Greatest Mystery/Thriller Of All Time.,"Alfred Hitchcock's speciality is thrillers. Some are straight thrillers, some conjoin with romances, horror, this conjoins with mystery. Hitchcock has combined these two, but has never done a better and more exciting film. Nobody has ever or will ever do a better, more exciting film. Having said that, is this better than, say, Vertigo or Psycho? Arguably. But Vertigo is a romance/thriller, Psycho is a horror/thriller and NBNW is a mystery/thriller. This does surpass other movies of its kind like Rear Window and The Maltese Flacon. The general story is a classic case of mistaken identity where a complex, top-secret government plan is under wraps. The movie grabs you by your collar the in the first two minutes and never lets go as the thrills and curves never stop coming at you full force. The main character (Cary Grant) careens to different ends of America as he must keep up with the game of cat-and-mouse he dies to get out of. Unlike Rear Window and The Maltese Flacon, NBNW features chase and danger sequences that add more excitement to its already mammoth exhilarating plot.Screw running, screw the gym. This movie can get your heart rate going in a much more enjoyable way.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
not Hitchcock's best,"i've decided to see all the films i haven't already seen that are listed on imdb's top 250 list.  so it was inevitable that i would end up watching 'North by Northwest'.either i'm wrong, or the thousands who voted this movie a '9' or '10' are...but i think this is not Hitchcock's best, and i don't even consider this a worthwhile movie to spend $5 renting.  and i clearly don't see this film as one of the 250 best ever.  [the most recently released spy movies i have seen, 'Spy Games' and 'The Recruit', were abundantly better than this disappointing film, and they are not ranked nearly as high up.]why?  (1) in today's age, this movie's special effects (and plot) are sorely dated; (2) the plot is implausible, whether you look at it from a 2004 antiterror or 1950s Cold War perspective; (3) what some would argue are the film's strongpoints (i.e., the romantic interactions between hero and heroine, Cary Grant's numerous wisecracks, etc.) really contribute to its flaws (see (2)).  saying anymore would spoil the surprise for those who are still planning to see it.want to see the quintessential Hitchcock film?  see 'Rear Window'...i rented it only the day before seeing 'North by Northwest', and its superiority is immediately evident.  even the romantic chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly is better; in fact, i dare you to come up with a better pairing. but it's obvious that 'North by Northwest' isn't even comparable in quality, beyond the fact that it, too, is a Hitchcock production.from my interpretation of this website, anything rated above a '7' is worth seeing, and anything above '8' is a ""definitely see, now!""...for that reason, i have to give this movie a '6'.  this flick is a poor man's James Bond movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The first Bond film ""avant la lettre""","In hinsight the films Alfred Hitchcock made between ""Vertigo"" (1958) and ""Psycho"" (1960) are the pinnacle of his career. At the time of release however ""Vertigo"" wasn't such a commercial success at all.For this reason Hitchcock wanted his next film, ""North- by Northwest"" (1959) to be of a very different nature. All psychology is gone and instead we have a very complicated plot with lots of action and unexpected twists and turns. We all know the scene with Cary Grant having a date alongside a lonely road through the desert and being attacked by a little airplane.The film became a commercial hit. Hitchcock had not only achieved his business goals, he had also made the first Bond film ""avant la lettre"". A few years later, in 1962, Terence Young would make the first official Bond film (""Dr No"").Guillermo del Toro once called lead actor Cary Grant the best James Bond that never was. Reasoning further along these lines, Eva Marie Saint is the first Bond girl ""avant la lettre"". She sure looks beautiful, but she is a serious actress as well. Five years earlier she was best supporting actress alongside Marlon Brando in ""On the waterfront"" (1953, Elia Kazan).",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Hitchcock film except for the abrupt ending,"This is one of the best thriller movies I have ever seen. Hitchcock has succeeded again in creating suspense and thrills for everyone to enjoy. The film is mainly about a advertising man who is mistaken for a government agent and is relentlessly chased around the world. Apparently the Oscars liked the film considering it gave it three nominations. I can see why this film is regarded as Hitchcock's best work. The only problem I have with this film is the abrupt ending, thinking it would be climatic it changes to a completely different location and it ruins the suspense for me. If you are going to have suspense and thrills throughout the film, don't ruin the ending by having it change and completely destroy the suspense that it builds.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
i mean come on!,"Before watching this film I have to say that I was anxious to see what many refer to as 'Hitch's best work' and with James Mason and Cary Grant I could hardly see how it could go wrong. But as with so many other 'classics', so many other pieces of 'perfect' film making I was horribly disappointed, and why? The film had so much going for it, but the fact of the matter is that by the end of the film I had lost 2 hours of my life that I will never get back and what is even more tragic is that Hitch lost months.It is easier to list the few good points than the masses of things wrong with this film so I'll start there: Cary Grant; James Mason; the direction (possibly; certainly not Hitchcock's best); the message that if you (the audience) value your masculinity you too will take the first opportunity to drink drive your way out of a perilous situation and let's not forget possibly the greatest moment in ANY Hitchcock film; train through the tunnel metaphor.But now for the rather more in depth list of terrible elements: I'll begin with the most prominent; the cheese, this film has cheese flowing out of the screen, and people argue that it spawned the stereotype rather than is part of it, but is that a good thing? Really? To have created a strain of films not only containing James Bond, but ultimately Tripple X. The direction, save for the crop duster scene is average at best. The ridiculous plot that has Cary Grant conveniently pulling a knife out of a man's back - i mean come on! The list goes on and frankly I don't have the time.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pleasant and Entertaining,"No, they don't make them like this anymore, but fortunately you can still rent a copy or better yet go see it in a theater somewhere.  Cary Grant is very good as the baffled ad exec being chased by, and chasing, international spies in a case of mistaken identity.  He never loses his cool and manages to shift effortlessly between comic and serious, making it all look easy. Good casting all around except maybe for Jessie Royce Landis who plays Grant's mother - not that she's bad in the role, but she doesn't quite look the part owing, perhaps, to the fact that she was actually younger (by 10 months) than Grant.  Movie audiences back then took Grant to be ageless, I suppose, and perhaps he was.  James Mason is good as the suave villain.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitch's best,"Hitchcock always called PSYCHO his ""fun"" picture.  It seems to me this film, which is my favorite of his, would fit that term better (though PSYCHO, a great film, may have been more fun for him, because it was probably less of a hassle physically to shoot, and because it appealed to his warped sense of humor), since this basically kids the genre he helped invent, the suspense thriller.  The plot, when you think about it, is a remake of his own THE 39 STEPS, and although I'm not a Hitchcock expert, others could probably point out echoes of other of his films in this one.  At the same time, it still manages to be quite suspenseful.Cary Grant was one of Hitchcock's favorite actors, and it's easy to see why; he lends a class and glamour to the film, yet allows himself to be put in all sorts of sticky situations which he is able to escape from, no matter how narrowly.  Eve Marie Saint is one of the best leading ladies he ever had, generating not only sex appeal but mystery.  Leo G. Carroll is quite good as The Professor, and I wonder if he was an inspiration for George Smiley.  Martin Landau is slimy as Leonard.  But besides Grant, the best performance here is by James Mason, who avoids going over-the-top to just ooze malice.  I especially liked his last line; ""Not very sporting, using real bullets.""  There are so many classic scenes it's hard to list them all, and Bernard Hermann's score is excellent as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Monumental,"A timeless classic, one of the all-time great motion picture achievements. Cary Grant is an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down in the most bizarre way when he is mistaken for a mysterious government agent. Throughout an exciting adventure across America he must contend with spies, romance, betrayal and, in one famous scene, a murderous crop duster pilot. The genius of North by Northwest is that, despite imitations and the countless thrillers that followed it, one never knows quite what the next plot twist will be, or even what is real and what is not. Even nearly five decades later, the astounding finale at Mount Rushmore remains an amazing feat. North by Northwest is the perfect merger of all that was great about Hitchcock and all what is great about film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Hitchcok's best movies,"This is probably the best loved of all Hitchcock's films and it is also one of his finest. It is a particularly daft comedy-thriller in that the plot hinges on a series of improbable events and it is hugely entertaining, full of classic set pieces. Cary Grant is the suave, debonair hero who finds himself clinging to a man with a knife in his back in the lobby of the United Nations Building. When he goes on the run, determined to find out who framed him, it isn't just the authorities who are after him but the villains as well. When he meets a leggy blonde on a train, (what is it with Hitchcock and trains?), she is not all that she seems. Eva Marie Saint plays her with an easy-going sexiness that makes her character very likable. And Grant has so much charm he gets away with playing Jessie Royce Landis' son when, in reality, she was only eight years his senior.The villains are James Mason and Martin Landau but they aren't given enough to do and as villains they don't feel threatening. What is threatening is the crop-dusting plane that appears out of an empty blue sky to chase Grant around some vast open spaces. And later, when Grant and Saint are chased over the faces on Mount Rushmore, it's our familiarity with the locations that heightens the tension. In the end the McGuffin, as Hitchcock called the device that held the plot in place, hardly matters. His genius is that he makes you care about the inconsequential things. This is a great comedy-thriller.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Suspenseful Spy Thriller by The Master of Suspense,"""North by Northwest"" is definitely one of my favorite movies by Alfred Hitchcock. He is a pretty darn good filmmaker who knows how to tell a story and where to point the camera at. The movie is about Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive, who has been kidnapped by Phillip Vandamm and his men by a mistaken identity George Kaplan who doesn't exist. So Thornhill has been wrongfully accused as a fugitive and pursed himself across the country. I thought the cast in this movie did wonderful. Cary Grant does a remarkable job for his performance for being funny, confused, and being likable. Eva Marie Saint was lovely in this movie and she was fascinating. James Mason and a young Martin Landau were terrific for playing their roles as the villains. Bernard Herrmann's score was outstanding for creating music for suspense, romance, and excitement. The cinematography in this movie is beautifully shot, and the cornfield scene where Thornhill is being attacked by an airplane is well done. Give thanks to the Master of Suspense for making such an exciting movie. I give ""North by Northwest"" a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fun,fast paced and entertaining Hitchcock ,but don't expect depth,","North by northwest is the 5th Hitchcock movie that i've seen,and knowing it's in the top 100 of the best movies ever made,i've had really high expectations..well i wasn't disappointed but i admit that it wasn't what i expected.the direction and visuals are grandiose,the camera angles and the photography,simply beautiful,especially the mount Rushmore final confrontation.

Masterclass Cinema!,"I have seen all those iconic scenes in snippets but have never seen the film in its entirety. By iconic I mean the scenes where a plane swoops down to attack Cary Grant like a hawk to a prey and the climatic foot chase at Mount Rushmore. Nowadays, the weak CGI might cause a frown on your face and they would probably feel too familiar, but you must remember they are first done here; this is the genesis. It's because of Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest that so many action scenes are possible. This is where it happened. I knew all that plus the taut suspense, the economically drawn characters, and the music score, but I never counted on such an awesome screenplay. The dialogue is simply amazing. Just the foreplay dialogue between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint is the stuff of so much conversations. It is erotic and playful enough to make me grin like a monkey. It is filled with eroticism, yet subtle, never high-brow, with a cheeky know-it-all tone. The suspense coupled with the comedy and romance is almost a template for movies of this type nowadays, but no one can direct like the master. The film may be 1959 but it feels so on the beat even today. This is masterclass cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fun thriller done with aplomb,"I went to see this movie with expectations. After all it's bouncing around (currently) at #20 in the IMDB website. Surely that says a lot? Well, yes it does and I did enjoy this piece (although not to a #20 extent).Plot? As usual with Hitchcock we have our bit of intrigue and shenanigans. Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill who is, alas for him, mistaken for a spy (when in fact he's a businessman). He starts having to run across America for his life, aided only by one Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) in an effort to understand what's happening to him, who is pursuing him, and whyThere's a certain taciturn nature to the performances in these pieces. It obviously reflects the mood of the day, and the reserved-ness of the people, but at times it seems to lend a `stiff' nature to what we see, when compared against the more fluid acting we see today (among those actors capable of actually acting). Still Cary Grant and Saint are perfectly good here and are able to show chemistry that doesn't need to have bodies mauling one another  their conversations can be particularly suggestive and they play off one another well. The rest of the cast, villains and whatnot, all hold to form well and are convincing in their roles (never falling to one-dimensions).The story is good. It's probably why the script got nominated for an Oscar. Just when you think you've got it all figured out, something shifts and you're forced to think again. My only complaint is that a major plot element of what's going on is revealed to the audience far in advance of Grant's own character. This spoils a fair bit of the tension, and I can but imagine that it was added solely as a concession to producers fearful of alienating audiences. Still there's enough action in here and good lines that this detractor does not spoil the movie itself.The direction is, again with Hitchcock, good. We get to see `tunnel vision' here (done well), and play the usual game of `spot-the-Hitchcock-cameo'. I also got to admire Hitchcock's other abilities  such as some great shots, which perfectly framed the moment, in particular his incorporation of the background into the moment. In fact there's no real complaints with his work here, and Hitchcock shows how he's able to achieve a good balance of intrigue, action, and romance without compromising the movie's integrity.And yet, for all this, I was left somewhat disappointed by `North by Northwest'. Perhaps I had too lofty of aspirations for it. Perhaps I missed something. I enjoyed it, it was good, but the tidied ending of it, plus a few other glitches, made me feel ultimately not entirely moved by the experience. To me `Vertigo' is a much stronger piece of work. To this end I award the movie a 7.8/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Hitchcock's World: Glamor and elegance have never been so spectacular, exciting and moving","North by Northwest is a maximum exponent of a way of filmmaking, of a type of film that can never be made again, that creates a world of emotion that more than simple escapism enriches our lives. A planet where you can reach north by northwest is Hithcoks's planet. It is a planet that can reveal our world, but that turns out to be substantially different, decanted, filtered, intensified by the most exquisite art, and as a result everything is more impressive, there is more color, more emotion, more rhythm.Our visual range is fuller of simultaneous information, the different visual planes of the image interact generating more tension, infinite details are revealed to us, gestures are more expressive without being deliberate, more plastic without being affected.In this world, strong emotions sneak in, like in our dreams, into the most anodyne of our routines: a man can be kidnapped when he responds to a notice addressed to another person in a hotel restaurant; you meet murderers in a crowded elevator and a few minutes later without knowing how, you are holding a dagger stuck in the back of a man you have just met; there are mysterious appointments in the middle of spectacular and lonely rural landscapes, and when you least expect it you are chased and shot down by crop dusters.With our hearts in our fist we see how a man has to climb a stone wall to the room of the woman he is in love with to warn her that her life is threatened, and he has to be quick because at the same time we see the girl up there, through the windows, in the illuminated room, finishing packing her suitcase and we know that as soon as she finishes that task she is going to leave the room and irrevocably hand herself over to her murderers.The emotional level and the situations in which life puts you are a couple of degrees above normal. You may have to try to kill the person you are falling in love with (and fall even more in love because you have no choice but to kill him) or fall in love with a person who you know is going to try to kill you again without you being able to understand why.In this world, a love scene is accompanied by a beautiful violin melody by Bernard Hermmann and a vibrant percussion fanfare accompanies you as you flee descending Mount Rushmore.Like other Hitchcock films, it is a film in which many exceptional talents come together but is dominated by the magical trio formed by the director and his two stars: in this case Hitchcock, Grant and Eva Marie Saint. It is a glamorous formula that already worked in Spellbound, much more so in Notorious and Vertigo, and that will be a failure in Torn Courtain.The film is unimaginable without its two protagonists. Eva Marie Saint is possibly Hitchcock's definitive sophisticated blonde, with all the haut couture beauty of Grace Kelly but giving her character much more flesh and weight, and the ability to reflect complex emotions. She brings that plus of being an absolutely exceptional woman, not simply an American socialite. And of course the hairstyle of that blonde hair is not to be forgotten.Grant represents what comes after 30 years of being an absolute star. His personality, his natural elegance is striking even in the way he looks at his watch. The expressive adjustment to achieve the ideal effect to awaken in the viewer the exact emotion that the scene requires. Again a perfect balance between the glamour of the star and the emotional capacity to build an unforgettable character. And naturally the suit helps.Hitchcock populates his world with many other fascinating people: James Mason, Jessy Royce-Landis above all, or the menacing Martin Landau.The locations are wonderful (in this case even the reconstructed ones): exquisite hotel lobbies, crowded New York streets at rush hour; the bustling Grand Central Terminal that contrasts with the silent and desolate plain of cornfields and straight roads that stretch to the horizon, where you can barely hear an infrequent bus or a small plane spraying in the distance; Mount Rushmore that we will be allowed to visit in ways we could never have dreamed of; the modernist house on the cliff that allows you to see through its enormous windows the exciting plots that unfold inside, or the classic and luxurious country mansion that surprisingly serves as a temporary refuge for a gang of criminals; and of course the 20th Century Limited express, in whose limited spaces the protagonist has the opportunity to fall in love with a mysterious and fascinating woman while managing to hide from the police.The ""plot holes"", which there are and many, would be considered so in our routine world, on Planet Hitchcock they are justifiable and even necessary poetic licenses, that is, they serve to increase the visual or emotional impact of the scenes or streamline the plot. The plot could develop without them, but the scenes would be much more bland or too many boring explanations would be needed.This plot does not stop insisting on many classic themes of Hitchcock's films, and is basically a kind of Notorious revisited (although in North by Northwest the viewer identifies mainly with Grant, and in Notorious with Bergman), but preserving its intimate side, it now gives rise to a great show of totally new dimensions.A miracle of a film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pure first class entertainment!,"Together with ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds"", ""North by Northwest"" is among Hitchcock's most famous and praised films. It has been said that this movie marks the beginning of the action/thriller as we know it today, and not without reason as this film takes Hitchcock's favorite plot (ordinary man in unbelievable adventures) to the extreme in an epic adventure across U.S.Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, an ordinary man who is mistaken for a spy and suddenly gets involved in a series of intrigues and adventures that will take him from Washington to Mount Rushmore as he tries to put an end to his problem. James Mason plays Phillip Vandamm, the international criminal who believes that Thornhill works for the U.S. government and desperately wants to kill him. Eve Marie Saint is Eve, a mysterious woman who helps Roger but has a secret agenda of her own.It is obvious that Hitchcock wanted to pleasure his audience after the mixed reviews he received in ""Vertigo"", as he gives thrill after thrill in this roller-coaster but always with class and elegance. Thornhill goes from one peril to another and the suspense is always on the rise. Also, his dark humor returns and Cary Grant definitely is the best man to deliver it.Cary Grant is perfect as Roger Thornhill, and it is probably the role of his lifetime. It is very well known the fact that James Stewart was the first choice but was rejected after the failure of ""Vertigo"". Even when personally I consider Stewart a better actor, Cary Grant was the perfect actor for the lighter Hitchcock; with his suave persona, good humor and classy elegance, Grant shines here as well as in ""suspicion"" and ""To Catch a Thief"". On the other hand, Stewart was more apt for the darker side of Hitchcock in films like ""Rope"", ""Rear Window"", and the masterpiece ""Vertigo"".Eve Marie Saint joins the ranks of the icy blonds in the Master's films, as the beautiful and mysterious Eve. There was clearly good chemistry between her and Grant, and the sexual innuendo is brilliant. One can really believe that they are a couple of lovers in the middle of the international intrigue. Martin Landau and James Mason complete the cast as the villains and they surely give brilliant performances. The young Landau was set for a bright future and he demonstrates it in this early role.Many things can be said about ""North by Northwest"", but one thing is true; while this movie is basically a series of scenes of danger and adventure, Hitchcock's masterful touch separates it from the rest and puts it in a superior place. His perfect camera-work and the score by the always effective Bernard Herrmann created immortal scenes. Sure, ""Vertigo"" is a superior movie, but it is easy to see why this one succeeded where ""Vertigo"" failed: ""North by Northwest"" was designed to please the audience.Honestly, ""North By Northwest"" is not a perfect movie, it has its flaws and it is definitely not Hitchcock's best film. However, it has a lot of something special that can only be classified as ""magic"" that one can't help but enjoy the 136 minutes of thrills and adventure that the Master of Suspense prepared for us. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"War is hell, even if it is a cold one.","Although it is one of his most famous it may not be considered among his best, which I think it deserves to be. North by Northwest is more than a cross-country trip across America to solve a case of mistaken identity, it is also a send-up of all the old detective and spy movies Hollywood made in the 1930s and 1940s. What Hitchcock has done here is take a similar premise from one of his earlier films, Saboteur, and create a funny, intelligent and wonderfully entertaining story filled with great visuals and one-liners.Cary Grant gives perhaps his best role for Hitchcock in his last as Roger Thornhill, a man caught up in the web of espionage and deceit as he tries to convince a group of men that he is not George Kaplan. Eva Marie Saint is quite a saint as the beautiful and tough Eve Kendall. Perhaps the true reason to this great success is due to Ernest Lehman's fully entertaining script that has many tart one-liners as well as enough twists to screw up even M. Night Shyamalan. Of course, Hitchcock was at the top of his game here, working between his two greatest pictures, Vertigo and Psycho. Here, he is just having fun, playing with us as we try to follow all the action and suspense. Truly, this could be considered a prelude to all those other action movies made today. Some are good, most are pathetic, but Hitchcock pointed the way and it is a path worth going down again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The coolest movie ever made: Hitchcock's Ninth Symphony,"image4.jpegAction and suspense: A hapless New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies.Asking which is the best Hitchcock is something like asking which is the best Beethoven symphony, but if pressed to the wall I would call NBNW Hitchcock's Ninth (and Psycho, his Fifth). The coolest of Grant and the hottest of Marie Saint is simply the coolest film ever made from every angle you can think of. Few people would contend that Cary Grant was not the coolest leading man of Hollywood's golden age but this pic is the peak of his coolness, along with that the coolest James Mason ever as the slickest polite villain of all time and the slinkiest Eva Marie Saint ever, all adds up to one of the slickest pieces of celluloid entertainment ever conceived. Most Hitchcock movies have one unforgettable white knuckle cliff hanger sequence but NBNW has two -- the chase out in the wheat fields by a poisonous crop duster biplane and the final chase across the faces of the four presidents at Mount Rushmore, which ends up literally ... as a cliffhanger. Even a third if you include the comical auction scene where Grant keeps making outrageous bids to attract the police and thus escape the clutches of the killers lurking in the room waiting to get him. So much has been written about this picture that there is no need to recount the plot other to say that it is a towering masterpiece of the romantic suspense drama genre with all players at the top of their game - and don't forget a young menacing Martin Landau as Mason's cold blooded sidekick, another great actor who just passed away on July 15, 2017 at age 89. NBNW is frequently rerun on TV so it's not hard to catch up with but it never gets old or fails to make you hold your breath even when you know what's coming next.

"Ode to Hitchcock, part two","It doesn't matter how hard we try to explain to somebody something that we know the other person would not believe because he perceives everything through his own point of view - they hear what they want to hear. But sometimes they get it right even if at first they were wrong.I'm talking of course about the case of the false identity in ""North by Northwest"". The movie stars dashingly handsome Cary Grant as a somewhat Cary Grant-ish character who is being taken for a spy therefore must be killed by the enemies. I have to admit after writing the premise of the movie I think of dozen of movie examples with the same formula but what differs this one from the rest and stands high above it are those who had created this remarkable movie.Beautiful cinematography, impressive special effects and excellent music score by the genius of Bernard Herrmann alone make this movie a milestone in the thriller genre. Cary Grant is as charming as ever but he rarely gets the chance to be serious hiding behind his big smile and a charisma of a comedian and there are not so many moments in the movie when he gets to show his dramatic side also which he delivers well nevertheless. The female lead, Eva Marie Saint, on the other hand, shows drama exclusively and is one of the main reasons I fell in love with the movie since the first time I watched it. The villains are a bit dumb and not evil enough in my opinion and it always was the weakest point in Hitchcock's movies but it doesn't spoil the movie anyway because even at 130 minutes the story flies by very quickly when one action scene changes the other and you are not able to leave until the ending.""North by Northwest"" is a legendary movie full of iconic and suspenseful scenes for which Alfred is best known for.

Probably the best mistaken identity film ever made, the film with the most exciting chase sequences (Man vs. plane!), the most awesome set pieces made (Mount Rushmore!) the funniest ""goof"" on screen (kid holding his ears when the gun goes off!) and probably my favorite Hitchcock movie ever. Cary Grant is just amazing in this totally insane plot of mild-mannered ad executive getting thrust into a ridiculous game of underworld espionage, where he's forced to run from planes, gets tied up in a drunk driving rap, is nearly run over by a semi AND has to fight off James Mason and Martin Landau! Ah well, if you're gunning for a blonde as smoking as Eva Marie-Saint, wouldn't you? A lot of this is so over the top to be taken totally seriously, and mostly it's just pure popcorn fun.

I was really disappointed with this , especially because it was a Alfred Hitchcock film. At times i was confused by the plot and at others i was just bored. Cary Grant's acting seemed wooden and the relationship with Eva Marie Saint was never convincing. The loves scenes were very cold and the 27 year age gap seemed very apparent.

An Absolute Gem,"A timeless masterpiece and (to me) Alfred Hitchcock's finest work. There are some movies that age brilliantly, where story, acting, dialogue, and presentation defy time, and endure for generations to enjoy and appreciate. North by Northwest, like Casablanca, is one of those rare films.This is also Hitchcock's most fun movie. Dapper ad-man Roger Thornhill, mistaken for a government agent, finds himself in a web of intrigue and danger, hunted by foreign agents, yet he remains suave and witty. More than 60 years after its release, the humor remains intact, the banter still sharp.

A one of a kind Hitchcockian experience,"Having seen most of Alfred Hitchcock's works I must admit that North by Northwest has quickly become my favorite, even though it may not possess the typical Hitchcockian motives. What's more, It could as well be placed in the same box as the James Bond franchise, because it may in some aspects remind of the well-known spy movies (Cary Grant could have been a perfect 007, with his elegance, handsome face and fantastic overall presence). However, I must say that it combines a better-developed structure, more wit in its dialogues and greater suspenseful sequences than any Bond movie does. Also, personally I thought that Eva Marie Saint was much more appealing than all of the Bond girls combined.The main plot introduces the whole movie as a serious and thrilling mystery of a man, who is mistaken for an agent and embarks on a journey to clear his name. Still, apart from that, there are various comedic aspects of the film, along with my favorite scene in the first few minutes, when Roger Thornhill (played brilliantly by Cary Grant) is being held captive, forced to get drunk and then ride a car. As for the romantic section, there is the ongoing chemistry between the devious Eve Kendell and Thornhill.All those aspects make up for an amazing and most enjoyable plot. The ideal mix of all the conjoint, yet rather opposing, factors marks the true genius of the director himself. Even though all of Hitchcock's pictures are undisputed masterpieces, North by Northwest captivated me the most. I haven't really seen a movie that offers so much - perfect plot-subplots combination, intelligent script, memorable scenes, many distinct sceneries, tremendous acting (great supporting roles by James Mason, Leo G. Carroll and Martin Landau) and, most importantly, the building of suspense until the very last minute. It is also the best Hitchcock- Grant collaboration you will find.Even though the picture didn't win an Oscar in any of the three categories that it was nominated in, it surely could have won an Award for the best picture of the year. Or the decade. Or the century. Because every time you watch this fantastic movie you will be able to find a new part that will catch your attention. That is the true genius of Hitchcock. He made a movie that brings out everything that is the greatest about the motion picture industry, that is the ability to develop a masterwork that can be interesting to every single person in the world.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Many ways to enjoy,"North By North West was made in 1959. You can enjoy it many ways. Let me enumerate: 1. It a predecessor to the James bond films with oily villains with interesting accents, and questionable sexuality out to kill in imaginative ways, always toying with their victims rather that simply shooting them outright. Cary Grant plays a character who likes brave clever repartee with his captors, though he has none of Bond's lethality, just his confidence.2. it is a love story, with lots of clever repartee.3. it is a comedy. Grant's cleverness and unrestrained originality at getting out of scrapes is amusing as is the existential strangeness of the predicaments.4. It is a period drama. It was filmed in 1959 with a cast of tens of thousands, all in accurate 1959 period costumes, and accurate period cars, in accurate period hotels, restaurants, streets and taxis. All this was much cheaper to do then. It is a treat for the eye.5. It is an adventure story with a car chase, explosions and the famous crop dusting scene, but because the special effects are somewhat dated, this aspect would not have the punch it would originally.6. It is a mystery with all manner twists and terms making you guess who is working for whom. It would probably take at least three viewings to begin to figure out the motives for each character at each point in the film.It is an oldie but goodie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Silliness Abyss,"Despite Hitchcock's penchant for perfection on two occasions (Rear Window & Psycho), this is an absolutely imbecilic excursion.

More interesting works like 'Rope' and 'Birds' have daring elements that make them stronger.Cary Grant is a block of wood.  Heck all the acting is simple by today's standards.  The plot, too, is nothing remarkable since there have been so many other ""running man/conspiracy"" movies since this one.

Hitchcock at the top of his game!,"I cannot believe it has taken me so long to watch this famous film by one of my favorite directors. It was never at the top of my 'to see' list, but I can say that this is another incredible film by Hitchcock.The story of North by Northwest starts off pretty simple, but make no mistake, this is probably Hitchcock's most unpredictable film (apart from everyone knowing Psycho's big twist). There are so many twists and turns in the screenplay that I could barely keep up, and it's because Hitchcock doesn't let us breathe for one second. We think we know who the bad guy is, then we are wrong. Fantastic screenplay by Ernest Lehman, with fantastic performances from Cary Grant and James Mason. Every time I saw Eva Marie Saint on screen I thought it was Betty Draper (January Jones from Mad Men) running around with another man. I'm telling you, January Jones looks just like her. Now if they make a remake (hopefully not, but we never know) they know who to cast.Overall, fantastic film. Probably a masterpiece in it's great story- telling, and possibly Hitchcock's 2nd best after Psycho.",,Anonymous,Mystery

I really like the direction Hitchcock took with this film.,"North by Northwest is a breezy espionage thriller, much lighter in tone than Hitchcock's later cold war spy movies, Topaz and Torn Curtain, and a whole lot more enjoyable as a result.Cary Grant plays Madison Avenue advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill, who is abducted by ruthless spy Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) and his cohorts, who have mistaken him for an FBI agent named George Kaplan. Unable to convince the enemy of his real identity, Roger escapes and goes on the run to look for the real Kaplan, aided by a beautiful, mysterious blonde Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).The action moves along at a brisk pace, with charismatic lead Grant making for a likeable protagonist and Hitchcock delivering a couple of his most iconic scenes-the crop duster attack and the finalé on Mount Rushmore-both of which are excellent. It's not all perfection-the moment where Thornhill is framed for murder is laughable, the poor sap grabbing the knife buried in a man's back and then turning towards a news photographer who just happens to have his camera at the ready-but for a couple of hours of pure escapism, North by Northwest is a good way to go.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock's finest hour,"North by Northwest is my favourite Hitchcock film. Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is a clean cut Mummy's boy with few vices.

Thornhill is the ordinary guy that is thrown into an extraordinary situation. Eve Marie Saint is the beautiful blond Eve Kendall who falls for Roger and ends up in grave danger. Vandamm is the sinister bad guy who gets his sidekicks to do the dirty work.The set pieces in this movie are truly memorable.

An American classic,"A film from the Golden Age of Hollywood that is almost as famous as its director: Alfred Hitchcock. Whilst I thought this film was good, I also thought that it was a little overrated. Sure the writing was subtle and nuanced, the performances were strong, particularly James Mason who was very scary as the villain, and not over-done and the crop-dusting scene was wildly entertaining, something for me just felt lacking from the film.Perhaps it was the ending which for me felt rushed and anticlimactic.

Not in Hitchcocks top 15 films - but that doesn't mean it's bad.,"North by Northwest blends a spy thriller ( with his trademark wrong identity) with romance, comedy and adventure. This film was important as it proved that Hitchcock was not only a master of suspense but a master full stop. We also need to remember that this film was prior to James Bond. Where it doesn't reach the heights of his best is I didn't feel an intensity/ fear for the protagonist unlike in say Notorious or Rear Window. It's lighter here- which is fine but I think Hitchcock was at his best when there was a darker/ sinister tone. Having said that there are some great iconic scenes and it is pretty enjoyable and well directed.

Hitchcock at his zenith.,"""North by Northwest"" is undeniably one of Hitchcock's best movies - not to mention one of my ten personal favorites in general. A brilliant script, full of well-planned twists, Hitchcock's energetic and vivid direction, the constantly clever dialogue, the first-rate production values, an incredible score by Bernard Herrmann (who pretty much ripped-off himself the following year when he wrote the score for ""Psycho"") and several memorable sequences (the often neglected auction scene is extremely amusing) are only some of the ingredients that make this thriller so terrific. I have two minor complaints, though: the film is SLIGHTLY overlong (maybe it could have been 15 minutes shorter) and Eva Marie Saint just isn't a particularly attractive woman, compared to Grace Kelly or even to Tippi Hedren, so she is kind of miscast in the role of a ""femme fatale"". And her performance isn't in the same class with the delightful ones that Grant and Mason give. But this is still a superb movie, and it is far less dated than the early Bond films, which it probably influenced.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best of Hitchcock,"The 1950s was a mixture of successes and failures for Alfred Hitchcock. Most of his successes are classic thriller films such as Rear Window, Vertigo and Strangers on a Train. Hitchcock did have some failures such as I Confess and To Catch a Thief, but I think by the end of the 1950s, his successes definitely outweigh his weaker pictures and he finished off this decade with the critically and commercially acclaimed thriller, North by Northwest.North by Northwest follows Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), a 'Madison Avenue', advertising man from New York, whose life is turned upside-down when he is mistaken as a government spy by the name of George Kaplan. He is mistaken for being a spy by a man named Lester Townsend (James Mason), who also seems to be a spy and is paranoid that this so called Kaplan figure has secrets about Townsend's organization. Along with his bunch of thugs, who are led by Leonard (Martin Landau), they attempt to turn Thornhill's life upside-down.Now a man on the run, Thornhill runs off to Chicago to find the real George Kaplan, who he thinks knows what is going on. However, Thornhill realizes that even when he is on the train, he is being chased. However, a beautiful blonde named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) is willing to protect him. However, is Thornhill safe with Kendall? Just watch the movie.Like all Hitchcock films, there are hundreds of things that aren't realistic though set in the real world and lots of highly improbable stuff going on everywhere, but if you give it a chance you'll enjoy it and won't care. North By Northwest keeps the winning streak going, and enjoys a well cemented stay in IMDb's Top 50",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"I rank it as Hitchcock's 19th best, myself","Let's get one thing straight: this film is tremendous fun.  Don't lose sight of this fact because of anything I say.  It's fun ALL THE WAY THROUGH, even when it creaks.  Moreover I can see some of the things that lead people to the ridiculous conclusion that it's a masterpiece.  Several scenes are classics in miniature - I can't really say which ones, but I suppose you already know about the crop duster sequence - then there's the priceless line Cary Grant delivers as he runs to the aeroplane on the slopes of Mt. Rushmore, so carefully led up to - and Bernard Herrmann's score is brilliant.And yet ...That damned Eve Kendall: SHE'S the McGuffin, not the ""government secrets"" the baddies are trying to smuggle out of the country.  (Clearly the film wants us to think she's so much more important than they are; but if it refuses to tell us what the villains want and why, how are we in any position to make a comparison?  Hitchcock's McGuffin theory led him astray here, I fear.)  The heroine of ""North by Northwest"" can't hold a candle to her vibrant counterpart in the original cross-country Hitchcock, ""The 39 Steps"" (1935).  Watch the original to see what's missing from the remake. The later film has a tendency, just a tendency, to fall asleep on its feet: it needed more poetry in its quest, more humanity in its hero, more vigour in its man hunt, less tedium in its exposition.  If I didn't know better - if I hadn't seen ""Vertigo"", released the previous year, or ""Psycho"", from the subsequent one - I'd say Hitch had ossified.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Looks great, but is a confused, less than shallow film","They had great cameras in those days, and from this comes the best points about this film - the cameras and how they were used. Very atmospheric, the cinematography is very well done and the visual editing very good.It's possibly better today at home in its excellent transfer to digital. (I rented the streaming film in SD, which was great quality on a computer monitor which is not large.)For me, though, that's nearly as far as it goes. The acting has a lot to commend it at times, and Cary Grant pulls off well what is very demanding - trying to tie the script's lack of conviction and film genre identity together.North by Northwest must be the most contrived of all spy films.It also fails as a typical Hitchcock entertainment piece, I think because the subject is always on the verge of real seriousness. But the film can never devote itself to such seriousness in the way that classic spy films do and in the way these subjects really deserve actually.Too far away from Sunday apple pie movie land to be endearing, too bitty, flimsy, theatrical and unsatisfying to be effective in basic thriller terms, and too unserious and kid glove hewn to be worth its salt amongst the lexicon of classic spy films.North by Northwest was a probably an impressive showpiece for cinematography and the potential of atmosphere and brilliance in the track from camera to cinema screen. But, like a beautiful damsel agent who flirts but is getting paid for her rehearsed attempts to win you, the film has little else of merit beyond its looks and moves.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Cinema Buff's Delight,"Cary Grant, kidnapped in the opening frames of the film due to a case of mistaken identity, is actually a red-herring in a cold war spying game.The game goes awfully wrong, and to set the matters right in comes the sultry blonde Eva Marie-Saint,an avatar of Mata Hari.After some cat and mouse games in a train , a crop-duster tries to mow down Grant in a widely acclaimed and much written about sequence.       But to my mind the auction sequence,in which our hero makes a perfect ass of himself inorder to get arrested and shake off his pursuers, takes the cake.It is top class hilarious stuff. This counterpoint between suspense and comedy is in fact  the tenor of the film.      The  tempo of suspense is heightened and maintained with the help of appropriate music and through shadows and sinister camera angles. The finale on Mount Rushmore is both literally and figuratively a cliff-hanger. Grant is poker faced and takes his series of misadventures stoically - a la 007. Eva Marie, though icily menacing on the outside , shows a vulnerability deep down which is alluring. As Grant aptly describes her ""she is a big girl, and in all the right places too "". The film is replete with such enjoyable one-liners. Cinema buffs would also love the editing wizardry - look out for the cut from Mount Rushmore to the upper berth in the train at the very end of the film. While not definitely the greatest of Alfred Hitchcock's oeuvre , is is nevertheless a cinema buff's delight. Rating - 8/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
My favorite and perhaps the most entertaining Hitchcock film,"This is certainly my favorite from among the director's many movies, and probably the quintessential Alfred Hitchcock film, I think. It employs all the successful elements of his previous films including the use of Cary Grant, as Roger Thornhill - ""the innocent man, unjustly accused, being chased cross-country while trying to prove his innocence"" and yet still manages to excite, surprise, and amaze with incredible imaging and suspense which is thankfully punctuated with humorous relief (some provided by Jesse Royce Landis, as Thornhill's mother Clara).Eve Marie Saint plays the cool blonde Eve Kendall excellently, but not quite as well as James Mason and Martin Landau perfect the villains, Phillip Vandamm and Leonard (respectively). Leo G. Carroll (appearing in his last of six of the director's films), Josephine Hutchinson, and Philip Ober (among others) also appear.So many memorable scenes, but to list just a few: the drunken drive by Grant, the return to the (now changed) mansion with the police, the murder of the U.N. diplomat, the auction scene, scenes on the train(s) especially at the end, the crop dusting chase sequence, those at the Frank Lloyd Wright house, and (of course) the ones at Mount Rushmore.The film received three Academy Award nominations: Color Art Direction-Set Decoration, Editing (George Tomasini's only Oscar nomination), and for Ernest Lehman's original story and screenplay; Hitchcock earned a Directors Guild of America nomination. It was added to the National Film Registry in 1995. #40 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list; #4 on AFI's 100 Most Heart-Pounding Movies list.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock in Peak Form,"Probably no director has made such masterpieces back to back as ""Vertigo,"" this film, and ""Psycho."" Although a bit long in the tooth, Grant is terrific as a man mistakenly drawn into a game of wits between the CIA and a group of spies. Saint is the ultimate icy blond, Mason makes an urbane villain, and Landau is creepy as Mason's sidekick. The dialog between Grant and Saint is surprisingly risqué for its time. Hitchcock keeps the action moving at a frenetic pace while building the suspense, helped by Hermann's marvelous score. The crop-dusting plane scene is justifiably famous, as is the finale atop Mount Rushmore. A masterful blend of action and comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining thrill-ride from start to finish,"Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of films, many of which are very good; and a select group of which are out and out masterpieces. His 1959 spy thriller, North by Northwest is undoubtedly among the man's best work; yet it stands out as something of a black sheep among the great director's other works. While the likes of Vertigo and Rear Window pull the viewer into the story by way of an intriguing and mysterious plot line; North by Northwest goes completely the other way, and draws you in with simple, old-fashioned entertainment value. It's true that there isn't much substance here, but at the same time; you can't doubt North by Northwest's credibility for a second, as Hitchcock has laid on the style and his story telling is as sharp as ever. The plot is typically Hitchcockian and sees a man kidnapped by a group of gangsters; on the mistake the he is someone else. After narrowly escaping, our hero goes on the run; from both the gangsters and the law. As he is drawn deeper and deeper into unfolding events, he finds himself more and more unable to stop them unfolding.By today's standards, North by Northwest could be seen as clichéd. Hitchcock has thrown in all the common spy thriller elements; from femme fatales and a British villain, to car chases and even an overblown finale; but Hitchcock implements all these elements in such a way that the film never feels old hat and, even now, nearly five decades on; North by Northwest is still an entertaining thriller, and that is testament to Hitchcock's endearing talent, as many of the recent films that are entertaining now, probably wont be fifty years down the line. Every set piece in the movie is beautifully engineered, and as the plot is perfectly paced; nothing ever seems like it shouldn't be there, and North by Northwest flows excellently. The film is best remembered for stand-out sequences including the famous bi-plane scene, but even those scenes, that have been seen separate from the movie many times, don't feel like they've been tacked on when viewing the movie in it's entirety. Many movies these days have instances that are there merely to be in the trailer and such; but here, Hitchcock is as restrained as ever, yet he still manages to insert scenes like this into the film.To be honest, I think Cary Grant got the short end of the stick with Hitchcock's films. While James Stewart got Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much and Rear Window, Grant only got gifted with Suspicion, To Catch a Thief, Notorious and this film; and while this one is very good, the rest of the Grant-Hitchcock collaborations are not among either man's best work. However, fans of both of these cinema legends can be thankful for North by Northwest, as both are on top of their game and in that instance; only a fine film can ensue. This isn't Cary Grant's best performance; sometimes he looks a bit out of place, and he's definitely spent too long on the sun beds - but his charm and charisma lifts even his most disappointing performances, and the one here certainly isn't one of those. Hitchcock's direction is flawless, and the film never feels clumsy or gets boring at any stage. If I was going to nit-pick, I would perhaps say that the film could have been streamlined a little bit more; but overall, North by Northwest is an entertaining classic that all fans of cinema need to see!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another excellent film by Alfred Hitchcock.,"Personally, this is not one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films, although it is one of the most acclaimed and one of the most interesting. The script revolves around a confusion of identities, where an ordinary citizen is mistaken for a spy and ends up in a tremendous confusion with gigantic repercussions on his personal life and national security.The script is quite good and the story has no dead moments. It entertains the audience in a perfect way until the end and makes us curious to know what is really going on, curiosity being an important part of what keeps us stuck in the film (and one of the reasons I prefer to hardly talk about the plot). The main character, played by Cary Grant, was so well thought out that we quickly established an affective and sympathetic link with her, caring about what will happen to her. It goes without saying that, although the cast is very good, it is really Cary Grant who stands out here. Eva Marie Saint is good, but she never leaves the shadow of the male protagonist. Another actor that deserves a positive note is Martin Landau.Technically, it is an impeccable film, to the taste of director Hitchcock. It is full of symbolic scenes or with more than one meaning, some of them bordering on the dreamlike. Some of the scenes are truly striking, like those that were shot on Mount Rushmore. The camera and film work is excellent and cinematography perfectly harmonizes color, light, shadow and contrast, resulting in a visually elegant film, although with the characteristics of a film of its time, of course. The soundtrack is also quite good, as are the sets and costumes.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Disappointment. But still a good movie to watch,"When he went to Hollywood, Alfred Hitchcock made the movie Rebecca, which cost just over $ 1 million, and had a good box office run. Alfred Hitchcock just wanted to sell a ticket for the people to enjoy a good movie in a good section. After Rebecca, Mr. & Mrs. Smith also had success with the public, however it was with Strangers on a Train, Dial M for Murder, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Vertigo and obviously Rear Window that Hitchcock had its biggest hits in his Hollywood career until the mid-50's.With that Alfred Hitchcock gained a lot of strength within Hollywood, and he got a big budget for this movie, North by Northwest. North by Northwest was another commercial project that Alfred Hitchcock embraced in focus in the espionage. North by Northwest was successful at the box office, but it was not on the same wavelength as his previous projects, which I mentioned here, especially Rear Window, and the film did little more than double its own budget. So Alfred Hitchcock returned to Psycho on a more modest budget.North by Northwest, it's a good movie. It has a good suspense, the direction is very good by Alfred Hitchcock, and the performances are solid, especially Eva Marie Saint, who is perfect here. The great sin of this movie, for me, are the characters of this movie. Considering the important ideas and techniques that Alfred Hitchcock developed that could fill some books. I always expected more from this project. The problem with this film is how some of these characters were written, in this department I particularly blame Ernest Lehman. Ernest Lehman, wrote the characters in an amateur way, in which these same characters do not look anything like humans when confronted with the same situations that appear in the film. Particularly the scene with the mother of the main character, when she confronts one of the ""supposed"" hijackers in an elevator. From this moment, I completely lost the notion of a film with a serious focus.And to be honest, the characters surround the comedy tone many times and in many situations, particularly in some situations with the main character at a mid-train station. From that moment, I completely lost interest in this film, and I just went to look at the movie just to pass the time. And waiting for the movie to end. For a film that wanted to be serious, and this was its initial proposal with the public, the movie was loses much coherence as a film. It was a disappointment, for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Go North, Northwest or any direction to see this masterpiece","Yet another masterpiece from the master, Hitchcock. Sure, I've seen very few of his films and I'm really partial to Psycho and The Birds, but North By Northwest is no short of a classic.Granted, this movie may seem dated now, 50 years later, and furthermore, I doubt, if remade, like Psycho, any of the events of this movie couldn't even be remotely possible today, given its time and shape of cinema in the late 1950s, this was a perfect movie. It had absolutely everything: adventure, mistaken identity, comedy, romance, spy and the everyman charm of one of the greatest actors of all time, Grant. He was absolutely perfect in his role, an instant charisma that made you believe in, root for and be like at all times. No one could do it better.As for Eva Marie Saint, she was wonderful too. It's funny. I'm a huge Superman fan (since age 3) and during this updated viewing of the classic, I kept trying to picture her nearly 50 years older in Superman Returns as Martha Kent. I couldn't do itthey just didn't look like. Despite that, she was great in her seductive role.Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill, a thriving ad-exec, who is mistaken for super-spy George Kaplan and gets thrust into a world he's unaccustomed to – the other side of the road. See, he's a self-proclaimed liar (advertising) and now that the shoe's on the other foot, he must adjust.Not before long, he's accused of drunk-driving (which, as I pointed out before, most of these scenes wouldn't work today; here, the DUI's all but comical), murder, eluding the police, etc, etc. He's trying to solve the mystery, survive and romance a stranger (oooorrrr, is she???) on a train, Saint.As in most Hitchcock classics, I'm always drawn to the intrigue, suspense, originality and acting, but I think overall – the dialogue. Here it's pristine. Sure, Grant is responsible for 90% of it, but Saint also delivers some zingers. And to this day, again, 50 years later, is still fresh, funny and moves the story in a perfect rhythm. I can't even think of many movies today that develop such a punch for such witty and sharp dialogue.I think all should see this: young, old, people that first saw this in theatres, or to those who need to put the Wii down for a few hours. It's a fun, extremely family-friendly film that has tremendous depth, layers, adventure and allows the audience to pretend (or I would as a kid) to be someone else, this Thornhill/Kaplan character.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"An excellent, first-class thriller - thrilling, chilling, and funny; one of Hitchcock's best","""North by Northwest"" may very well be one of the most entertaining and highly enjoyable thrillers ever made by a major Hollywood studio. I mean that, really. Expertly directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the film fires an arsenal of thrills, chills, first-rate performances from a first-rate cast, spectacular action set-pieces, and humor. Even with the humor, you can forget how profoundly disturbing this movie can be at times, but it's all part of the fun of ""North by Northwest.""I'll be the first ever to admit that I'm no Hitchcock fanatic in even the slightest sense, but there is one reason to believe that he was one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived. The man knew his way around films in a way few filmmakers today will ever be; today's wannabe directors, take note. The way he composes his scenes, his actors, and the on-screen action with expert precision and style shows that he always knew what he was doing when he was behind the camera, and he rightfully earned the respect as a master filmmaker.The film toys with the idea of identity. ""North by Northwest"" begins with a kidnapping, and a case of mistaken identity: a hapless Manhattan advertising executive, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is taken hostage by hired goons and brought to the lavish estate of one Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Here, he is harshly interrogated by his captors, who believe that he is really a secret agent of the government named George Kaplan. Thornhill tries to prove his innocence to them to no avail, and is soon plunged into a series of harrowing events of escalating danger, adventure and magnitude, culminating in him dangling for his dear life from Mt. Rushmore with the would-be love of his life Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), the mysterious woman he met while on a train trying to elude his would-be captors.""North by Northwest"" may very well be one of the greatest chase movies ever made. The movie itself is a slow-burn of escalating danger and suspense, as Our Hero Roger Thornhill finds himself thrust into events that he can neither understand or comprehend. And we identify with the confusion he has over the surreal turn-of-events that have taken over his life. Cary Grant infuses his character with enough confusion and witty one-liners (many of which are actually quite funny and earn some much-needed laughs to alleviate the suspense) that he earns our sympathy as an Everyman who is forced to take the reins of being a hero to fight for his life against an unspeakable evil.Of course, this film is also noteworthy for its groundbreaking and suspenseful action sequences, the most spectacular of which is the infamous ""crop-dusting"" scene, which has to be seen to be truly believed. That scene alone is worth the price of the admission. Rather than waste time on special effects and explosions and things of that nature (today's filmmakers, again take note), Hitchcock instead relies on the tension and the slow build-up so that he lets us have it with a one-two punch to the gut. Hitchcock also makes expert use of wide open spaces during this scene, and the wide-angle lens of his camera, so that even even when an airplane is the only thing we see in a wide-angle shot of a corn field, there is still an ever-looming sense of danger that something else could jump out at us from anywhere on the screen.""North by Northwest"" is an expertly directed thriller from the ""Master of Suspense"" Alfred Hitchcock. Today's filmmakers should definitely take note of this film and look for the many reasons for why it is as good as it is. His next film after this was of course the granddaddy of today's slasher flicks (and my personal favorite Hitchcock movie ever), 1960's ""Psycho.""10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A top notch Hitchcock film...score: 9 (out of 10),"I am not much of a Hitchcock guru as some people are mainly because I find most of his films as being the same type of scenario - human chasing something or someone, or human being chased by something or someone.  No where is this more evident than in this movie.  The film opens when Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) comes out of his Madison Avenue office to attend a social gathering at a local bar.  While he is in the bar, two thugs mistake him for a double agent and, of course, he is abducted.  He is transferred to the whereabouts of a certain Mr. Lester Townsend (James Mason).  I am not going to give out any more details except from there on out, Thornhill winds up being chased and chases the culprits, who want to see his demise, to the final scene at Mount Rushmore.  Along the way, he finds time for romance with a certain lady friend (Eva Marie Saint).  The best part of the movie happens when Thornhill is pursued through a cornfield by a crop duster - a classic Hitchcock scene.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Cross-Country Adventure.,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this highly entertaining adventure film that stars Cary Grant as advertising executive Roger Thornhill, who, while in a New York hotel, is mistaken for government agent George Kaplan by a foreign spy ring led by Philip Vandamm(played by James Mason) who refuses to believe Roger when he insists it is a case of mistaken identity, after having him kidnapped. Roger manages to escape a deathtrap, but is thought to be a reckless drunk driver, and so goes on the run to prove his innocence, and fight the spies. On a train, he meets Eve Kendall(played by Eva Marie Saint) who helps him, but may not be all she seems either. Roger must dodge repeated assassination attempts, as he eventually makes it to their hideout atop Mount Rushmore. Leo G. Carroll plays a key role late in the film, and Martin Landau is fine as henchman Leonard.Grand scale adventure is wonderful entertainment, with memorable action scenes, performances, and a breathless pace. Contrived and far-fetched to be sure, but so well made that it doesn't matter.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
one of Hitchcock's experiments in timing,"Just as Hitchcock used the elements of suspense and timing in Psycho, they are at work here again in North by Northwest. Grant, the lead character, is in the middle of some giant spy thriller adventure, running all over the country ( scope the different venues - the UN building, an auction house, farm fields, trains, and the thrilling climax at an American landmark...) In Psycho, what the audience thinks is the lead character is killed off early in the movie... here in N by NW, it's a different kind of timing experiment - the hero of the movie (and the viewer!) are kept in the dark, caught up in the intrigue until three quarters of the way through the movie. When Cary Grant (and the viewer) are filled in on what is really going on, it's an easy transition to complete the rest of the movie, and the plot sort of changes over to a ""will the good guys beat the bad guys ?"" plot, and the viewer has to be able to buy into some of the things that happen... I think this is another of Hitchcock's experiments in timing. As usual, there are the usual inside jokes planted here & there through-out. The love/hate relationship between Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant makes for an interesting love story, and what a spectacular ending!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of My Favourite Hitchcock Films,"""North by Northwest"" gets off to a mysterious start. Roger Thornhill, a New York advertising executive, is kidnapped and taken to a luxurious home in the countryside. He is interrogated by a group of men who believe that his real name is George Kaplan, and refuse to believe him when he says that he has never heard of Kaplan. The kidnappers attempt to kill Thornhill in a staged car accident, but he manages to escape. He discovers that the real owner of the house is Lester Townsend, a diplomat accredited to the United Nations, and goes to the UN building to speak to him, hoping that this will solve the mystery. Thornhill discovers that Townsend is not the man whom he met in the house, but almost immediately Townsend falls dead with a knife in his back.Hitchcock liked to tease his audience, and this film is a good example. At this stage we are as much in the dark as Thornhill. We do not know why he has been kidnapped, who Kaplan is, why the kidnappers want him dead or why Townsend was killed. These things gradually become clearer as the film progresses. We learn that the man behind the kidnapping is named Philip Vandamm and that he is the head of a spy ring betraying America's national secrets to the Russians. Thornhill is forced to go on the run, both from Vandamm and his associates who wrongly believe him to be a CIA agent and from the police who wrongly believe him to be Townsend's killer. He manages to escape with the assistance of a mysterious blonde named Eve Kendall, who may be in league with either Vandamm or the police.It is interesting that James Stewart was considered for the role of Thornhill but rejected in favour of Cary Grant because he ""looked too old"". Grant was several years older than Stewart, but was perfectly cast because this is an older man's film. Thornhill is (like a number of Hitchcock's heroes) an Everyman figure, a man who has hitherto led a prosperous but uneventful life in a routine job. He has no middle name, but has taken to calling himself Roger O. Thornhill. He is well aware of, and makes a joke of, the fact that this set of initials spells ""rot"", but is perhaps unaware of the symbolism of placing a meaningless zero at the centre of his name, with an implication that there is also a meaningless zero at the centre of his life. He has twice been married, but both marriages ended in divorce because his wives found his life too dull. Now, in middle age, he finds himself confronted with the possibility of adventure and of romance with Eve, with whom he has fallen in love.Eve is rather older than the normal Hitchcock heroine. Eva Marie Saint was thirty-five years old when she made the film, a decade older than, say, Kim Novak had been at the time of making ""Vertigo"", Hitchcock's previous film. Although Ms Saint's looks could have been those of a woman ten years younger, her voice and mannerisms were more suggestive of a sophisticated older woman than of a young girl. (She gave what must have been one of the most seductive performances ever given in a film with no overtly erotic content). Eve was originally Vandamm's mistress but, on learning of his illegal activities, agreed to help bring him to justice because, as she puts it, it was the first time she had been asked to do something worthwhile. For both Thornhill and Eve, the entanglement represents a chance to make a fresh start in life.Another excellent performance comes from James Mason as Vandamm, an outwardly suave, debonair English gentleman. This characterisation may owe something to a notorious case some years earlier when Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean, two young Britons from privileged establishment backgrounds, defected to Moscow after being exposed as part of a Communist spy ring. This impression is strengthened by the implication contained in the film that Leonard, Vandamm's henchman, is homosexual, as were both Burgess and MacLean.The film's most famous scene is the scene where Thornhill is menaced by the crop-dusting plane. Hitchcock may have included this sequence as a deliberate challenge to his ingenuity. The normal convention in thrillers is that suspenseful scenes exploit one or the other of two common phobias, claustrophobia or vertigo, and take place either in an enclosed space or high up where there is a danger of falling. (Hence the expression ""cliff-hanger"" for any tense situation; the film also contains a good example of a cliff-hanger in the literal sense, the final scene on Mount Rushmore). The crop-duster scene, however, is set in flat open country, but still generates great tension as Thornhill races for the cornfield, which provides the only cover in an otherwise featureless landscape.The film contains a number of elements which had become familiar features of Hitchcock's work- the man wrongly accused of a crime, espionage, a train journey, a glamorous blonde heroine, a chase sequence, an element of comic relief (especially the auction scene) and a cliff-hanging finale at a famous landmark. Despite this familiarity, however, the film never declines (as do some of his lesser works) into mere film-making by numbers; Hitchcock was able to use a tested formula to produce something fresh and exciting. Evidence of the film's success is provided by the fact that a number of other directors pay homage to it in their works; the nudist colony scene in Mark Robson's ""The Prize"" is a direct reference to the auction scene, and Stanley Donen's ""Charade"" borrows the device of the villain using another man's identity. (In that film too the victim is a diplomat). Apart from its immediate successor, ""Psycho"", ""North by Northwest"" remains my favourite Hitchcock work. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Probably the most comedic Hitchcock,"While it doesn't quite reach Rear Window/Vertigo levels of greatness, there is still plenty to be enjoyed from this one.

Hitchcock and Cary Grant at the top of their game.,"One of those great flicks you don't mind watching over again every year or so. Top drawer suspense, all wrapped up in sophistication and some of the best man/woman chemistry ever captured on film. Definitely the highlight of Eve Marie-Saint's career. (I'm betting she'd agree.) Cary Grant was never better. And Alfred Hitchcock, some of whose work made me wonder why he was so celebrated, truly got it right in this movie. Some of the more memorable scenes: Cary Grant creeping along a ledge, high above street level, and slipping through an open window into a sleeping woman's hotel room. ""Stop!"" she cries out when she sees someone coming through the window. Then, as Grant hurries through the room toward the door, glancing at her and apologizing, she more entreats than commands, ""Stop!""

Makes me wonder what they could have done with a more effective beginning, specially as it gives a lot of time for ""questionable"" behaviour from the lead. But once it gets some speed, it is well paced and executed. Witty liners, charming acting. Some rather predictable twists (for someone in modern times).

Cary Grant steals the show,"""North by Northwest"" is one of Hitchcock's best movies. A funny, adventure-filled thriller about an advertisement executive, played by Cary Grant, who is mistaken for a government agent by some powerful unscrupulous characters and kidnapped. Eventually framed for murder then, he goes on the run, with the police, FBI and the criminals whom he has invariably crossed all hot on his tail. Cary Grant is fantastic. He delivers so many witty and sarcastic lines throughout the film, one of my favourites being ""I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives and several bartenders that depend upon me, and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting myself slightly killed."" He was in good shape in this for a man over fifty. Hitchcock's direction is evident and as powerful as it ever was; the Mount Rushmore scenes are highly applaudable and were a fitting backdrop for a story that took us to many places and mad scenarios. Ernest Lehman is the one we have to thank for the story and script. Grant, Hitchcock and Lehman's work together help ensure that ""North by Northwest"" maintains a perfect balance between serious, high-octane thriller and comedy.""Something wrong with your eyes?""

It seems long and has a number of scenes that are clunky and unnecessary. All the Mother stuff is corny and contributes nothing to the story and goes absolutely nowhere and is frankly frumpy when meant to be funny.Talk about slick.

Essential Hitchcock...great mixture of humor and suspense...,"Ernest Lehman's screenplay for 'North by Northwest' must have caught Hitch's eye from the start--it's so typical of the kind of film he loved to make (a man on the run from unseen or unknown enemies). He milks every drop of suspense and along the way injects a lot of humor and sexual innuendo with the usual blonde femme fatale (Eva Marie Saint) providing a good number of delightful moments. Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are perfect in the leads and James Mason and Martin Landau are highly satisfactory villains.It's all great fun, with Grant mistaken in the opening scene for a Federal Intelligence agent who doesn't really exist. He is soon swept up in a an amusing and suspenseful twist of plot complications involving spies and counterspies with an unpredictable series of nail-biting scenes that never let up until the smashing climax at Mount Rushmore. The dust-cropping scene is a highlight, skillfully edited and photographed for maximum effect.As usual, the suspense begins with the opening credits as Bernard Herrmann's staccato notes of music prepare us for what follows.

It's impossible to praise this film too much,"Arguably director Alfred Hitchcock's best-loved film, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is an insanely skillful blend of action, romance, comedy, and intrigue that never feels contrived or strained. The film was almost instantly embraced by critics and audiences as a film masterpiece, and it has since only grown in reputation as one of the all-time great films of any era. Amazingly, this is certainly one case where such high ended praise is completely deserved, and, in fact, this is one of those rare films that have been heralded as a ""classic"" for decades that truly meets such impossibly high expectations. As a matter of fact, it very well may be impossible to say too many good things about this picture.Alfred Hitchcock is always a director that typically placed technical film craft over the importance of such necessary dramatic devices such as plausible plot twists and significant character development. As a matter of fact, the 1946 film Notorious (which gets my vote as the master's best film) is probably the only truly character-driven film of his career. However, the artificiality of the plot and strictly two-dimensional nature of the character is absolutely not a problem in this film, and may even be one of its strongest assets. This is because NORTH BY NORTHWEST, as with Hitchcock's 1955 picture TO CATCH A THIEF, is a total farce from beginning to end, and typically strong storytelling elements such as a clear narrative and believable characters would have only bloated the picture.Further cementing the film's status as an unquestioned masterwork is the jaw-dropping number of eye-catching set pieces that retain in the memory even years after the picture has ended, yet somehow manage to gel into a coherent whole. Hitchcock was in the absolute peak of his technical prowess here, and each and every scene plays out with the seemingly impossible professionalism that only a truly skilled and inventive filmmaker can achieve. Sure, the now-landmark crop duster scene and the Mt. Rushmore finale are now as permanently etched in the public's collective conscious as the Nation Anthem, but virtually any other scene in the film (no matter how minor it's significance) is nearly as stunning. And Hitchcock also pulls memorable performances from Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Jessie Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll, Phillip Ober, and Martin Landau  all whom are perfectly cast and play their intentionally thin roles with an alarming exactness.Yet even more than Hitchcock's film-making mastery, the real reason the film is an absolute gem from beginning to end is none other than Cary Grant. At age 55 and still unnervingly handsome, Grant is perhaps Hitchcock's perfect on-screen hero as he jump-starts even the most under-developed roles with magnetic charisma, dapper humor, and an disarming sex appeal that remains absolutely effortless even in his third decade as actor. The film basically calls upon Grant to venture into practically ever screen personae that he had personified up to that time, and the dashing actor impressively never misses a beat. Although NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a film that has completely earned the title of masterpiece for many reasons, watching one of the silver screen's ultimate stars work his uncompromised magic is reason enough to hold it in high esteem.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The plot is pretty solid too.Roger Thornhill gets roped into all sorts of unexpected activities, firstly reacting with indignation but then gradually adapting as he comes to accept the circumstances and understand his role.Hitchcock uncovers the plot twists on a gradual basis instead of confusing us by going in too heavy or too deep, inviting us into the film by gently pushing forward the intrigue and not bamboozling us by making us think too hard. I didn't second guess the plot at all though, which is a sign of a really great film, afterwards feeling as though I'd witnessed something worthwhile, feeling happier with my day and overall disposition in life.An unexpected film with strangely subtle James Bond, albeit action-free undertones and a few minor implausibilities, but which grabbed me within the first few minutes and kept me there throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Hitchcock's ""blue"" movie","Picasso had his ""blue"" period, and blue figured prominently in some of Elvis Presley's recordings (""Blue Moon,"" ""Blue Moon of Kentucky,"" ""A Mess of Blues,"" ""Moody Blue,"" and so on).  But I don't recall hearing much about Alfred Hitchcock's blue period.  Yet, the great director's ""North by Northwest"" is awash in that color, so much so that it must have been a deliberate, and, therefore, significant move.Blue, and a rather unattractive pale shade of it at that, is everywhere in ""North by Northwest,"" so damn prominent that I found myself annoyed when watching what was once one of my favorite films on video.  Yes, there was so much blue that ""North by Northwest"" may not be one of my favorite films for long.  Blue, especially that pale shade, is not my favorite color.  But there's Cary Grant in a pale blue suit; the interior of the train he boards when fleeing the police is blue; the sky, of course, is blue; and, well, there just seems to be blue--that sickening pale blue--everywhere.  What was Hitchcock thinking?  The master of suspense was famous for planning his films down to the smallest detail, so unless I saw a bad video transfer, he must have had a reason for emphasizing that color.Well, ""North by Northwest"" is still one of Hitchcock's greatest films, although what stands out after repeated viewings is not that crop duster scene, or the escape from enemy agents across the faces of Mount Rushmore, or the naughty image at the conclusion, but the music:  Bernard Herrmann's score is one of the composer's most thrilling and unforgettable works.I must say that after my most recent encounter with the blue hues of ""North by Northwest,"" I appreciate all the more the fact that Hitchcock made his next film (""Psycho,"" of course) in black-and-white.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Nothing special,"In the good old days of movie making,the fifties and sixties, thrillers and horror were reliant on suspense and incinuations rather than the gore and hide from the killer type formula of today. This is, what the 'master of suspense', Alfred Hitchcock did so well. Not so with this film I'm afraid.Cary Grant is the leading man who is mistaken for somebody else. Causing some crooks to pursue him for, err a while. Grants love interest comes in the form of Eva Marie Saint. A rather implausible and predictable twist rears its head. If you think about it, you can probably guess it without even having seen the movie.Talking of suspense this just lack suspense. Compared to hitchcock movies such as vertigo. The bad guys just aren't threatening. They're just like cartoon monsters, they chase but they don't kill. This being pg entertainment and for the films time its understandable. Though bad guys shouldn't have been drawn in this way anyway. Surely Hitch realised that? I think that the films main downfall is that the bad guys are shown to much. Early on we know they're not threatening pursuers. Theirs no suspense damn it! The thing Hitchcock does so well in other films is disguising the miscreants, rather than showing them so much, which leaves little room for incinuations and the classic who done it question. Also the fear of what we the viewer do not know.The fact also remains that Cary Grant isn't that good an actor. He may have been good for romantic roles but here he feels out of place. Sure, he has some good lines, Which inject humour into his character, but unlike hitchcock regular James Stewart he can't do serious that well. He just comes across as bumbling, stupid and unable to solve the films final resolution. Making things more implausible.To conclude I'm surprised that the film is so highly acclaimed, as it really isn't a patch on the likes of psycho, vertigo or rear window.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thriller that interests me more than it thrills me,"Out of all the different types of movie, the one I'm continuously mystified as to which angle to hold it from and examine it, is the brainless action film, the one that shuns using our brains to think about it for not having used any in the making. And out of all the different types of movie that want to entertain an audience, this one entertains me the least, the James Bond type of spy adventure that stages spectacle in an elaborate ever-increasing scale, that takes us on a tour through exotic locales to introduce us to exotic characters, where at some point we find ourselves on the top of a Monte Carlo casino or the French Riviera or Mt. Rushmore. This one seems like a prototype of sorts. To the extent that it wants me to be excited by climaxes where people hang from cliffs or find themselves chased by planes, I'm left cold. As usual for Hitchcock, the movie must stop dead in its tracks for two people to fall in love. In Notorious at least the double-entendre played by the two love partners is intriguing because they're saying idle things in place of meaning important questions, am I being loved, am I appreciated as a person, here they're saying things around actually saying ""I want to hump you on the carpet"".What excites me in North by Northwest is synchronicity, things happening by an act of fateful chance or as an agent for it. The fates conspiring to play a game in the chance raising of a hand in a restaurant, entire worlds changed from one moment to the next. Like a film noir hero, indeed one who is later seduced into the web of a wily femme fatale, the hapless puppet dangling on strings pulled by an unseen puppeteer, doing this with a smile like the dangling and the pulling too is part of the chance game that is meaningful for only as long as it lasts. I like how Cary Grant is at once bemused and irate that he can't prove he's not George Kaplan. At the same time it seems absurd that he can't. I like the atmosphere in the hotel room scene, characters walking in on Grant and identifying him as Kaplan although none of them has seen him. Kaplan is at once a persona non grata and a tabula rasa. There's no built-in mental content in the idea of George Kaplan; once Grant becomes identifed the name, through external experience and perception associated with the name, he is the name.But then, this is a film that doesn't quite have the time to focus on that. It needs to get moving. I like how the cropduster scene begins, Grant getting off a bus in the middle of an anonymous flat wilderness, fenceposts jutting out from sodden earth. How he eyes warily someone he thinks is George Kaplan on the other side of the road, like a western shootout is about to erupt except the two of them are wearing dusty suits. I don't like how the cropduster goes on, and I don't like the Mt Rushmore conclusion. Or any of the minor scenes where Grant is not acting a part.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining old film,"I'm feeling a certain amount of pressure to write a review worthy of what is apparently one of the greatest films of all time. Unfortunately, I'm not a cinematography graduate or anything...It's just a great old Hitchcock film, one that is still enjoyable to watch 55 years after it was made. One thing I liked in particular about the movie is how it showed a 1959 America that is sparkling and cool, functional and beautiful. Everyone was dressed up to the hilt. It's like a time machine.I was delighted by the seduction scene between Roger and Eve, especially Eve's sexy forwardness. No wonder Grant's character was bowled over. Saint's performance here was astonishing.Grant's too actually. A real old-school movie star, Grant carried the movie really well. He conveyed a suaveness, charm and sense of humour you just don't see anymore. Times have changed!The film had a fast pace and good story that made you wonder where it was leading and what was coming next. The dialogue is snappy, so you have to listen closely.The movie lacks the naturalness or realism you'd expect in a modern film (that doesn't involve superheroes or giant lizards). Every character was a character. It felt staged, as if every scene was meant to be iconic. There was a certain mannerliness and at times even a campness to it. Not a bad thing at all.Did this movie entertain me? Absolutely. It was entertaining on every level, really. Did this film move me at all? No. Did it have any depth or shed any light on the problems of this world. No.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitch at his best,"The Bernard Herrmann music, the Saul Bass titles and as those names hit the screen, Cary Grant, James Mason, Eva Marie Saint, of course Hitchcock himself, the hairs stand up on the back of my neck, as we begin the next instalment of our Lockdown Hitch Retrospective. I adore the energy of this film. Yes it's packed with classic suspense, but it's also a thrilling ride at quite blistering pace. We start in the hustle and bustle of the city as Ad man Roger Thornhill (Grant), gets caught in a case of mistaken identity as the wanted spy George Caplin, wanted by Phillip Vandamm (Mason), he of most wonderful voice. In fact all the voices here are rather special. Right from the get go we're thrust into the murky world of Cold War espionage. Thornhill gets chased by goons, turns out to be an excellent drunk driver and in his attempts to figure out what's going on, only digs himself deeper, with one suspenseful scene after another.
The scenes, oh boy! That aforementioned cliff side night time car chase, the murder at the United Nations building. Literal back stabbing and all before we get to the Prairie stop. The crop duster scene is a stone cold classic, a beautiful contrast of starkness against the otherwise majestic backdrops. Like the cafe at Mount Rushmore, Vandamm's gorgeous home and Rushmore itself. I suppose the chase scene finale over Mount Rushmore is considered the centrepiece, but truthfully any number of locations here would be fitting of such praise. That they're all packed into one film and so cohesively is astonishing. It does feel like it relies a lot on the stunning locations, but the plot really is fantastic. Add to that some classic 50s dialogue and genuine stars delivering it, it's clear to see why this works so well. You forget how funny and charming it is too, Grant delivers some wonderful lines and his chemistry with Saint is pure Hollywood romance. Martin Landau as the sinister and rather bird-like Leonard, personifies the dangerous world this slick production inhabits and in any other film would steal the show. I can't find a single flaw and nor would I want to. North By Northwest makes you want to love it... and I do.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"I have a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives and several baaahtenders dependent upon me.","Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill is caught up in a most-absurd set of mistakes and blunders that a super-spy like Phillip Vandamm ever made! Roger is kidnapped, forced into drunk-driving and left for dead by the cell of profit-oriented commie-sympathizers headed by James Mason's Vandamm. This gets our hero good and mad, and he's determined to get to the bottom of things. When he gets chased into a cornfield by a machine-gunning crop-duster pilot, it provides us with one of the greatest SPFX of the 1950's! Wouldn't THAT tick you off, if it happened to you?? Roger eventually learns that not only are the bad guys pulling strings on him, but his own government is manipulating him as well, he wants out! Roger doesn't intend on disappointing his string of dependents by ""getting myself SLIGHTLY killed."" But, beauty gets this Madison Avenue advertising exec back into the spy game when the glorious Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) becomes vulnerable to ""detection and elimination"" as the CIA puts it. Like Gilda, Eve is a very immoral girl who's sacrificed her honor for a comfy life as Vandamm's mistress...in reality, she's a good girl who fights for truth, justice and the American way. The principals end up almost defacing a famous monument (somewhere near Rapid City) toward the end of this flick. Hitch's funny-bone is working well, as the very-drunk Cary tries to save his life while careening down a twisty mountain rode in a convertible...it's actually a very scary scene as Cary narrowly escapes injury and death several times, but it's also hilarious. The morning after, in police court, Roger's lawyer states publicly that he knows his client to be a reasonable and logical man, only to be publicly contradicted by Roger's cynical mother. Like Arabesque, it's all very unlikely, but still tremendous fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Harder to love than to solve a mystery,"This is, to me, my second favorite Hitchcock movie, next to ""Vertigo"". Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is kidnapped by two thugs working for a crafty criminal, played by James Mason; Grant is mistaken for purely someone else. He finds himself soon taken with Eve Kendall, a beautiful-yet-cold woman played excellently by Eva Marie Saint, who is a double agent for all practical purposes, working for the CIA(?) and the crafty criminal who must be caught. Grant is his suave self, and Eva Marie Saint is very appealing.Yes, it is easier for him to solve the mystery into which he is unvoluntarily absorbed than to win Eva Kendall's affection. The three settings (New York, Chicago, and Mount Rushmore) contribute to the intrigue of the movie. The climb around Mount Rushmore is tense, though, of course, it is not the real mount itself, just a large, convincing replica. The South Dakota scenery, however, is beautiful, the comical aspects of the movie are entertaining, and the well-constructed a la Alfred Hitchcock plot maintains well the viewers' (viewer's) attention. An outstanding cinematic feat for Mr. Hitchcock.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Hitchcock,"Probably my favourite of the Hitchcock films I've seen to date, over Psycho, Dial M & Vertigo.Cary Grant's just brilliant as Roger. One of the most convincing & faultless pieces of acting you'll ever see, superior to James Stewart, in Hitchcock roles.I had problems with the casting though, not the acting or characters, they were all brilliant, but Cary was 54 when this was made, by my reckoning, yet played someone half that age, his Mum was a few months younger than him & Eve seemed far older than the character she played, which she was.Ignoring Cary Grant's grey hair which slightly belittled his role & two or three aspects of criminal behaviour which don't really hold up in today's world, (why didn't the villains drive past in a car & shoot rather than a plane?) and a story dragged on 10 or 15 minutes too long, it's still a pretty awesome film with the usual superb acting, music & cinematography you expect from Hitchcock, but also with some amusing humour thrown in.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly cheerful for a Hitchcock film,"If you had to name Alfred Hitchcock's two most influential films, you could not go wrong with Vertigo and Psycho. Both are dark psychological thrillers that delve deep into the human psyche, in which you can trust no one or anything, and even though, according to the customs of the time, the good guys win in the end, they're not what we would call clean victories.North by Northwest happens to be the film Hitchcock filmed in between these two monoliths. And it's clear he had decided that he needed a break, because by his standards this is almost a holiday film. But, it's still very much a Hitchcock film. The camerawork is superb and rather noticeable, but in a good way. The characters have that Hitchcock feel to them. And the plot is still a mystery story.But somehow it feels more lighthearted than usual. And I think it is the dialogue that's to blame. Plus the music that's almost frivolous in tone. This is a spy thriller where gorgeous men and women exchange witty one-liners over martini glasses, the villains twirl their mustaches and the death traps defy all expectations. It is almost like a proto Roger Moore James Bond film, over a decade in advance.And yet it is a Hitchcock film, with all the goodies that usual implies. Aside from the nail-biting corkscrew of piling tension, that is. Is it his best film? Nah, but it's a breath of fresh air if you've watched a whole bunch of his films and want something a bit lighter, but still in the same style.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Also, did he purposely tell the actors to act corny? I literally laughed out loud in multiple scenes because either the dialogue was terrible or the choreography was terrible.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Adventures Of Mr. Thornhill,"My opinion of this film is mixed. At times the dialogue is clever and amusing. And the final fifteen minutes offer some genuine suspense, together with excellent visual perspective. During this final sequence, the physically risky maneuvers of the main characters, ordinary and vulnerable, contrast thematically with the stone-cold lifelessness of past characters, grand and immortal.But oh my, the trial of having to sit through two hours getting to that last sequence. Highly contrived, the adventure plot is overblown with sequences that defy logic and scatter the location settings in a near-random manner. As such, the plot seems chaotic, disorganized, and unedited. Major sections could have been excised, or reduced in length. I think the film runs about thirty minutes too long.Color cinematography is acceptable for the 1950s. Today, the cinematography looks antiquated and clunky, with day-for-night camera filters in outdoor scenes, and lots of rear-screen projections.As advertising man Roger Thornhill, Cary Grant is clearly miscast, looking way too old for the role. I have no problem with the rest of the casting. And James Mason is always a delight to watch and listen to.There are some memorable visuals in this film, like the crop-dusting sequence. But overall, ""North By Northwest"" offers a poor script, until near the end. Hitchcock made some really terrific films in his day. But this is not one of them.",,Anonymous,Mystery
The Ultimate Hitchcock Film,"Ernest Lehman, the writer of North by Northwest, set out to write the ""ultimate Alfred Hitchcock film,"" and I think he succeeded. This is probably the most Hitchcockian movie Alfred Hitchcock ever lensed, the summation of a career of obsessions and ideas into one film. It's his Fanny and Alexander except with Cary Grant, spies, and a chase over Mount Rushmore instead of a Swedish family dealing with their issues.Roger Thornhill is an advertising executive with two ex-wives and several bartenders dependent upon him who gets mistaken for a spy hot on the trail of a criminal, Phillip Vandamm who's stealing, let's say, government secrets. Like I said in my Foreign Correspondent review, the MacGuffin in this film is probably my favorite, being a vague ""government secrets"" that's so far outside the point of the action of the film as to be pretty much meaningless. The meaninglessness of the central plot device though allows the audience to focus far more on Thornhill himself along with Eve Kendall, an employee of Vandamm's who may have more to her than meets the eye.What sets this adventure apart from Hitchcock's previous outing with Cary Grant, To Catch a Thief, is that Grant has more than just his own charm to run the show. There's an actual story of a man trying to clear his name and the obstacles in his way instead of the man clearing his name being an excuse to spend time on the French Riviera. The antagonist is clear from the beginning, his motives for pursuing Thornhill made clear as well. The case of mistaken identity comes up out of coincidence and drives on because of how characters see the world and those around them. Thornhill's continued insistence that he's not George Kaplan, government spy, just convince Vandamm all the more that he is the spy because his disavowals sound so unconvincing to a man expecting someone more attuned to the lies of the spy game than honesty.The other third of this triangle is Eve Kendall, Vandamm's mistress. She and Thornhill have an easy rapport, as one might expect from a pairing where half is Cary Grant in an Alfred Hitchcock film, and the attraction is palpable, but she keeps him at arm's length. She's playing a complicated game already as the government's mole inside Vandamm's organization, and the sudden appearance of the spy Vandamm's been looking for but who keeps insisting that he's not the spy complicates her situation. The balance that ends up playing out as Thornhill eventually takes up the mantle of Kaplan. It ends up being a rather plot heavy affair, but what makes it work is really the focus on the two characters at the core of the struggle against Vandamm.Thornhill as the innocent wrong man who becomes part of the game, wonderfully played by Cary Grant, carries the audience through the adventure with charm and humor. His cynical handling of the situation as an effort to cover for his own bewilderment and fear is both a humorous and fun window into the action for the audience, but because Grant plays it as a cover for fear, it never disassociates from the action at hand to become fourth wall breaking material. The audience's perception of Eve helps as well as she moves from innocent bystander to nefarious double crosser to an earnest woman both caught up in events and an eager participant on the side of the good guys. Both are sympathetic protagonists and great anchors for the audience.And the adventure that surrounds those characters is really just all kinds of fun in big ridiculous ways. Every major set piece of this film is really famous for a reason. The crop duster scene builds so perfectly as Thornhill steps out of the bus into the middle of nowhere and we watch as the scene quietly develop. Each car is supposed to be his contact, and each car simply drives on by, all the while the plane flies around in the background, the quiet of the scene building tension as we wait for something to happen before the crop duster turns on Thornhill and starts its run.The scene atop Mount Rushmore is great as well with clear action about where every actor is as Thornhill and Eve try to escape Vandamm's henchmen, climbing down the faces of the presidents in an effort to find safety. It's ridiculous, but just so well executed that it's purely fun to watch.The production is completely first rate with huge sets, wonderful uses of matte paintings, and a great array of locations. The music by Bernard Hermann is propulsive and energetic, helping to push along the narrative. It's bright and colorful and the most purely fun movie Hitchcock had made since The 39 Steps.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One crazy roller coaster,"North by Northwest stars Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, and James Mason and is directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The film revolves around an advertising executive named Roger Thornhill who is mistaken for another man named George Kaplan who is forced to go on the run from the government as well as a secret organization who is out looking to kill him. There are two ways of looking at this film. One is just looking at this picture as your standard plot with your typical protagonist and antagonist. But the second way is looking at this in a psychological way. Meaning did all of this actually happen or did he create this fantasy just to escape his boring mundane life? Or another way you can look at this is Roger Thornhill and George Kaplan the same person? And this movie isn't built or structured like a psychological thriller like some of Hitchcock's other movies. But this is Alfred Hitchcock were talking about here. And no other director can take this concept and turn it into a psychological film. Only he can turn a simple concept into something that will make you question your own sanity and have you dissect each frame and shot of the film. That's why this movie is so brilliant as we journey down the rabbit hole inside of Roger Thornhill's warped and twisted mind as he tries to solve the mystery that makes us never leave. I never found myself bored or irritated because I didn't want the journey to end as Alfred Hitchcock hypnotizes the viewer into joining him on this crazy adventure. And the adventure never stops as we have different genres like action, adventure, romance, and comedy all wrapped up in a nice bow. And all these different genres fit so perfectly together that you can sit back and relax without ever scathing your head in confusion. In the end this is one of those movies that will stand the test of time that it has become the inspiration for movies that borrow the same plot, but they will never live up to this. What makes this North by Northwest so brilliant to watch is that you forget your watching a two and a half hour and that the studio and everyone on board put in their sweat and tears to deliver an entertaining movie. And it's no surprise that this film is listed in AFI's top 10 mystery films of all time. So overall, this is by far one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies that is definitely worth watching if you haven't seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Patience is a virtue."" ""So is breathing.""","Yeah, love it. What Hitchcock fan doesn't?North by Northwest is generally considered one of Hitchcock's more agreeable works across his fandom, and one understands why. James Bond fans will certainly love it (in fact you'll recognise one of its scenes that was later used in 'From Russia With Love'!). It defies symbolic or metaphorical interpretation and invites you to enjoy a whirlwind of off-the-wall adventure.(The title is, after all, ""north by northwest"". North by northwest does not exist. Rejection of realism is the point of this film. This film is supposed to be escapist entertainment, no deeper meanings required if you are not so inclined.)Cary Grant is hilarious as the baffled everyman caught up in a spy network. Eva Marie Saint does not disappoint either as the feisty, calculating, double agent sidekick.

NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) - 18/10/2019,"I don't know if the film is busy enough to be a real wild ride, but for its time, and even now, it really is really fun, and while you shouldn't really expect the dramatic weight found in many of Hitchcock's other thrillers, style, intrigue and entertainment value converge tightly enough to make this one of, if not the legendary filmmaker's crowning achievement. When the run is done, the final product goes worn down by dramatic limitations, as well as tonal unevenness, believability lapses and, of course, an overblown structure, but through excellent score work by Bernard Herrmann, sharp cinematography by Robert Burks, thoroughly clever writing by Ernest Lehman, an electrically charismatic lead performance by Cary Grant, and a lively directorial performance by Alfred Hitchcock, all behind a grandly adventurous and intriguing story concept, ""North by Northwest"" stands strong as a thoroughly entertaining affair that may be Hitchcock's most realized classic.Mitchell Bulfin",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""North by Northwest","Watching ""North by Northwest"" is like taking a thrilling ride on a roller coaster that never quite lets you catch your breath. From the moment Cary Grant steps onto the screen as Roger Thornhill, you're drawn into a world of mistaken identities and relentless pursuit. I vividly remember the first time I saw it; I was captivated by the mix of suspense and humor that Hitchcock masterfully weaves throughout the film.Cary Grant's charm is undeniable, and he perfectly embodies the suave yet hapless protagonist who finds himself in a whirlwind of chaos. His transformation from a seemingly ordinary advertising executive to a man on the run is both entertaining and thought-provoking. I found myself laughing out loud during his encounters, especially the iconic scene in the crop duster, which left me on the edge of my seat. The tension was palpable, and I could feel my heart racing as he desperately tried to evade his pursuers.Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall adds a layer of intrigue and allure to the film. Her character is complex; she oscillates between being a potential ally and a source of danger. The chemistry between her and Grant is electric, and their witty banter is a highlight that showcases Hitchcock's knack for dialogue. It's a dance of deception and desire that keeps you guessing about her true intentions.James Mason, as the suave and sinister Vandamm, is a perfect foil to Grant's character. His calm demeanor and menacing presence create an unsettling atmosphere that enhances the film's tension. The supporting cast, including Jessie Royce Landis as Thornhill's mother, adds depth and humor, grounding the film amidst its more outrageous moments.The cinematography is nothing short of stunning. Each frame feels meticulously crafted, and the iconic scenes-like the chase on Mount Rushmore-are etched in my memory. Bernard Herrmann's score is the cherry on top, elevating the film's suspense and drama with every note. I found myself humming the themes long after the credits rolled.""North by Northwest"" is a masterclass in filmmaking, blending action, romance, and humor into a seamless narrative. It's a film that celebrates the art of cinema, reminding us that sometimes, the thrill of the chase is just as important as the destination.

You can never go wrong with Cary Grant, though (""How does a girl like you get to be a girl like you."").  A fun movie, with my favorite movie scene of all time (the crop duster).

"""North By Northwest"" is a classic efficient chase thriller full of unforgettable sequences filmed by the master Hithcock and being the inspiration to many other films","Counting on many of Alfred Hitchcock's classic narrative components, ""North By Northwest"" is an exciting chase thriller, which also features a curious sexual subtext, quite daring for the time. With the fatal blonde, the famous macguffin (in this case, the agent ""Kaplan""), the troubled relationship between mother and son and scenes filled with the purest suspense, the feature establishes itself as a remarkable work, although inferior to the works- cousins released a year earlier (""A Body That Falls"") and a year later (""Psycho"") by the master of suspense.Initially, we have doubts whether or not Roger is the wanted person, but we are quickly sure that it is a mistake, largely because of the good performance of Cary Grant, who convinces us of his innocence. Kidnapped and pursued by mistake, Roger finds himself in an unusual situation, wanted by spies and also by the police, living under constant distress while trying to prove his innocence. Among the actor's good moments, it is worth mentioning the scene in which Roger is left drunk in a car, in which, despite the lack of realism (the back projection has not aged well), Grant plays the drunk man well and saves the strange sequence. On the road. The actor conveys the security that the character requires, doing well in scenes that require physical effort and still showing charm in front of women. Another interesting aspect of the character is the deep respect that Roger shows for his mother, who does not believe him during the investigation of the drunkenness case, causing the character to lose credit before the police (another topic much discussed by Hitchcock, the troubled relationship between mother and son.).Meanwhile, Eve, the blonde on the train played with sensuality by Eva Marie Saint, plays the typical femme fatale role, involving Roger while she seems to be trying to save him. His spicy dialogues on the train have a clear sexual connotation, confirming the master's boldness already demonstrated in other films and wide open here. But her look after kissing him indicates something suspicious, confirmed by the note she reads next. Eve works for the fake ""Townsend"" and therefore avoids closer contact with Roger at the farewell, as she doesn't want to get emotionally involved. But, in the end, the girl was already in love with him, starting to help him while she is forced to sleep with his main persecutor - and therein lies the thematic boldness of the feature, which, as in "" Interlude"", forces the character to sleep with the enemy.During the first half hour of ""North by Northwest"", Hitchcock seems excited by the idea of remaking The Wrong Man, but in a different tone, as if he were trying to tell the same story in two different, if not antagonistic, ways. Cary Grant's ""wrong man"" reacts to all plots as a comedy character. Even the method used by Vandamm's minions (James Mason) in preparing the ""accident"" is stretched to the semi-caricature: with a liter of bourbon in his stomach, the hero is put in the direction of a stolen car and released on the road zigzagging a precipice. This type of suspense is the most elementary for any other director, but it works perfectly within Alfred's sense of humor, the sinister, which inserts in North by Northwest some quotes from chosen passages, such as that road where the same Cary Grant might have been with the intention to throw Joan Fontaine into the abyss, in Suspicion (Suspicion).The theme of the innocent who takes himself for a criminal (or secret agent, as it is now) - in the broadest sense: the mistake about the identity of a character - is one of Hitchcock's favorites, running through several of his tapes: the double of the murdered diplomat at the beginning of Foreign Correspondent; the vacationing bourgeois hero whom spies go after in both versions of The Man Who Knew Too Much; the two faces of Kim Novak, causing two misunderstandings, in Vertigo. The most serious moment of this theme came in The Wrong Man. Now he goes back to whatever comes his way - and drags Cary Grant across some of the United States. Evolving horizontally from the metropolis to the countryside, isn't the action of North by Northwest on The 39 Steps' itinerary? On the way, on the New York-Chicago train - chasing that Kaplan he continues to be confused by Vandamm, and having all the police in his wake - the stalker-chased bumps into a blonde, fascinating and unpredictable, so much so that she hides him from the police officers and betrays him (without his suspicion) to enemy spies. And so, in Eva Marie Saint's cabin, Hitchcock sets out to overcome Hitchcock: discovering in Eva a sex appeal that the actress had certainly lost at the Actors Studio, he forces her to undergo a metamorphosis that almost gives Eva the sensuality of Ingrid., Grace and Kim - in those kisses from Notorious (with Cary Grant), Rear Window and Vertigo (both James Stewart). And this Eva new look (or hitch look) throws herself at Cary Grant for a long kiss, with stages and interruptions (or suspense), in an almost balletic movement: if everything turned to James & Kim, in Vertigo's carousel kiss, now rotate the artists. Hitchcock has the title of master of suspense. But with four of the ""ten best"" kisses in movie history, he can't just go with that title.Cary Grant in red cap, as baggage handler in downtown Chicago - and the cops chasing all the red caps like silly cockroaches: anti-cop thriller. The sequence in which North by Northwest moves away from all models is already close, showing how Hitchcock, creator in repetition, is the same at the time of invention. On a deserted road, one man: Cary Grant, who has an appointment with Kaplan there. A car passes, another passes - little movement. The camera, following the character's gaze, examines the landscape: in the distance, spreading smoke, is an airplane. Absolute silence. On the side of the road, another man appears. Will it be Kaplan? Is not; he is waiting for the bus and notices before taking it that that plane, strangely, is wasting insecticide in a place where there are no crops. The bus leaves, Grant is alone again, the plane comes. The most unusual combat: plane vs. Men. The tension in a crescendo, the man throws himself to the ground, the plane passes; before he returns, the man runs to hide under the wheat field - the plane throws the insecticide cloud over the field. With a single character, pitting him against a machine (and reducing him almost to the condition of a grasshopper), Hitchcock has just built one of his most admirable exercises in suspense. And, as he is in a MMA, this mixture of surrealism and science-fiction ends with a gratuitous, but splendid (and euphoric) explosion: the plane crashes into a tanker truck.The courage of provocation, another Hitchcockian quality, cannot be better expressed than in the final movement of North by Northwest. Already in Chicago, placing Eva Marie Saint (lover of communist spy Vandamm) in the same situation (FBI & sex) of Ingrid Bergman in Notorious (wife of Nazi spy Claude Rains), he turns sharply when entering South Dakota, for the ""democratic"" epilogue"" by Saboteur. The last sequences, in the house so modern that it almost looks Martian, in the lights of the improvised landing field and in the hustle and bustle at the time of boarding the plane, Hitchcock moves from the realm of science-fiction to that of ""film-in-series""."". Who would have that courage? Who would do this provocation? The narrative's horizontal line becomes vertical at Mount Rushmore-""wrong man"" and ""false spy"" running up and down Washington's and Jefferson's noses or slipping through Lincoln's hair and nearly shaving Teddy Roosevelt's mustache. Them and the spies. And the suspense, which has gone all the way, ends with the heroine's suspension by the hero, in an ellipse-cut that takes the film from the edge of the abyss to the upper bed of the train cabin. The train enters a tunnel - ""it is a phallic symbol; but you don't have to tell anyone that"", revealed the author.This is one of several works by Hitchcock that feature the soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann and the opening credits sequence by graphic designer Saul Bass, which is generally cited as the first in film history to feature the extended use of kinetic typography. With the advent of cinema and graphic animation, the possibility of combining text and movement emerged. The first examples of letter animation appeared in 1899, in the advertising work of George Méliès. In early films, much of the text was static. It was from the 1960s onwards that the opening of films with titles with an authentic characteristic of kinetic typography began. Scholars acknowledge that the first film to make extensive use of kinetic typography was Alfred Hitchcock's Northwest. With credits texts that ""fly"" from top to bottom and bottom to top, and finally disappear into the film itself. A similar technique was also employed by Bass in the film ""Psycho"" (1960), which is also by Alfred Hitchcock.The film is also considered an inspiration for the official James Bond film series that would later be produced in cinema. Anyone who has seen North America knows that it is a film with a lot of espionage, several scenarios, surprising shots such as the classic scene of the plane in the cornfield sequence, the chase on Mount Rushmore. While not officially a spy, Cary Grant could pass for one. In North By Northwest, it is possible to perceive the aesthetic that would mark the official James Bond films. They start to be produced in 1962, that is, three years after Hitchcock's classic, the first being ""007 against the Satanic Dr. No"" with Sean Connery.With minor problems, especially in the realism of some scenes, ""North By Northwest"" is an efficient chase thriller, but it never gets to be brilliant. Alfred Hitchcock was known for meticulously planning every scene in his films. This stands out even more in North America, full of unforgettable sequences.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The most fun and entertaining Alfred Hitchcock movie,"I just got done watching North by Northwest (1959) for the first time ever and this is the most fun I've had with any of Alfred Hitchcock's movies.Positives for North by Northwest (1959):
This is a movie that was titled as ""the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures"" and this movie does live up to that tagline in almost every way possible. This is also the most entertaining spy thriller movie Hitchcock has ever made up to this point in his career. This movie almost feels like a parody of the other Hitchcock spy thriller movies from the last and I mean that in the best way possible. The dialogue and banter between these characters is at an all time great with this movie and even the actors themselves are having fun with this dialogue. The acting from the entire cast is phenomenal, but the standouts in this movie are easily Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill and Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall and their ""Will they, won't they"" dynamic is among the best I've seen from this Hollywood trope. All of the action and chase set pieces here are full of energy and these are the best set pieces in any Hitchcock movie. And finally, the big climax of this movie is by far the most cynically entertaining finale Hitchcock has ever done in his career.Overall, North by Northwest (1959) is a masterclass in filmmaking and the most entertaining Alfred Hitchcock movie I've ever seen in my life.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
North by Northwest,"The worst Donen film, Donen didn't make. Even the great ones will lay an egg on occasion and Alfred Hitchcock was no exception.

Costumer Harry Kress captures 1959's fashion with a flair, while leads Eva Marie Saint and, a Cary Grant who, per the pressed plot, can't seem to escape his gray suit, are at their physical peaks which does nothing to make the Mount Rushmore moment anything more than a campy Saboteur re-do (SoL).

Foreign spies are supposed to infiltrate another foreign country to collect classified information, and they didn't even know how to identify their opponent agent ? They got the whole itinerary of that agent, but didn't even know what he looked like?The whole scenario was just scripted for the later development, Hitchcock seemed to pay attention how ridiculous the scenarios were, just threw in lot of crap into it and made up a so-called Mystery or Thriller.

10/10,"""North by Northwest"" is a spy film directed by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. There are some elements of tension here, but they just appear. Ambientando in the first phase of the Cold War, the film tells the story of Roger Tornhill (Cary Grant ) who eventually becomes a government agent by accident, falls in love with another agent, and finally becomes a hero, yes, the hero's journey already existed in the 1950s, obviously is that the script is much more, after all we are talking about Hitchcock, we have many plot twists, many threads and great characters, it is an absorbing film and does not distract the viewer's attention, technically it is also great, nothing amazing, with raised camera angles and urban planning and great a soundtrack composed by Bernard Herrmann, as well as great performances, and for me the highlight is the practical effects of the film, which are spectacular for their time. Despite this, ""North by Northwest"" does not surprise with anything other Hitchcock films, but we have a great technical setting and a very attractive script. This movie needs something specific.With a great performance by Cary Grant, an intelligent story and some suspenseful and memorable scenes, North by Northwest is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best novels and an iconic crime thriller that influenced many great thrillers to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

NBNW -- Another one to the list of masterpieces,"It is easy to say that Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most notable, best film directors that have ever existed. His suspense-filled plots, daring situations, and twists were carried throughout North by Northwest. I absolutely LOVED this movie, but then again, it's hard to NOT like any Hitchcock films.Every time you think you know what is going to happen, Hitchcock works his charm and completely changes it. Throwing out twist and turns during the course of the entire movie, he keeps his audience on the edge of their seats. He installs fear into the average person, something commonly seen throughout a lot of his movies. Setting up the plot for an innocent man being wrongly accused for something he had nothing to do with.Hiring a great cast, Hitchcock wanted only the best. Cary Grant portrays his character very well to the fullest extent. Eva Marie Saint also held true to her character. Although this movie has an intense plot filled with suspense, the comedy evens it out pretty well. It is the one-liners from Grant and the predicaments he gets himself into that has the audience laughing. I believe Hitchcock does this in order to relieve the audience from thinking too hard into the plot.Overall, this was an extremely good movie!

My favorite movie!,"This movie is my favorite movie ever. I have seen it over twenty times, own a copy on video, and I never grow tired of seeing it. Ernest Lehman wrote an impeccable script, and the soundtrack of the film drew me into the movie music of its composer, Bernard Herrmann, who is a god, I think, officially. Grant and Mason are wonderful, and who could resist hearing their famous voices together in the same film. I love the way James Mason says, ""Rapid City, South Da-ko-ta."" The dialogue is quite funny. Hitchcock creates several great scenes besides the Mount Rushmore and the famous cropdusting scenes. For instance, the scene in which Roger Thornhill and his mother are on the elevator with Van Damme's henchmen, who are out to kill him. Only Hitchcock could make this so superbly. As the elevator descends, the music grows more intense and suspenseful, until the breaking point, at which Roger's mother says ""You gentlemen aren't really trying to kill my son, are you?"" To which the henchmen respond with side-splitting laughter, and are echoed by all the people on the elevator, including Roger's mother (played splendidly by Jessye Royce Landis), who laughs loudest of all.The house which Van Damme resides in at the end is quite architecturally unique, as much as the house in Glen Cove is elegant and done quite well. There are some character actors in this film who will remind you of other roles they had, like the guy who played ""Chief"" in the hit series, ""Get Smart,"" or the guy who plays one of the henchmen, who was the psychiatrist in a movie about a character played by Anthony Perkins who had a mental breakdown.I admire Martin Landau's work in this film, and think he is severely underrated. Thank goodness he got some recognition for ""Ed Wood."" The trick of rubbing a pad and paper to find out an address as employed by Thornhill in the hotel room amazed me as a kid. Notice Thornhill (Grant) whistles ""Singin' in the Rain"" when he pretends to shower. Also, notice Hitchcock's cameo at the beginning when the titles are being displayed, he walks up to a bus door right as it is being closed, and as he walks forward, his title, ""Directed by Alfred Hitchcock,"" disappears horizontally, left-to-right.This movie is best watched from the very beginning before Leo the Lion's roar, while eating coconut cake (with 3 layers and real coconut, not angel flake). I really have tried it that way, several times.The panic scene that ensues after the real Mr. Townsend is knifed by one of Van Damme's henchmen in the United Nations Building is great cinematography. The ladies standing up, in shock, the photographer, the person saying, ""He's got a knife,"" and Thornhill's protestations of innocence go together to make a great scene. I am reminded of the panic scene near the beginning of Hitchcock's ""Saboteur,"" in which the munitions plant begins burning down. You watch ""Saboteur,"" and you'll see what I mean.Eva Marie Saint is gorgeous in this and I wish I had been around back then in the wonderful fifties. Her red colored dress is particularly beautiful. All the dialogue in the love scenes is great, and of course, Hermann's musical number, ""Conversation Piece,"" is quite good. I have the soundtrack on CD.Of all the lines in the film, I like this one the best ""Did you know you overplay your various roles, Mr. Kaplan? First you're the typical Madison Avenue man accused of a crime you know you didn't commit, now you're the peevish lover, stung by jealousy and betrayal."" It goes something like that, and is spoken by Van Damme (James Mason).",,Anonymous,Mystery

Roger and out,"Talk about your change of pace. After making the dark, disturbing masterpiece that was ""Vertigo"" the year before, Hitchcock decided for his next trick to lighten proceedings with the playful and sophisticated ""North By Northwest"". For those who criticise the Master for only making the one type of movie, these two consecutive movies show that while ostensibly staying within the thriller genre, it's possible to extend your range and capabilities as a director without turning wholesale to period drama or sci-fi. Put it another way, they aren't two films to watch in a double feature. Which is the better of the two, well that depends on whether you prefer Mozart over Beethoven. Or do as I do and split the difference.Just like ""Vertigo"", ""North By Northwest"" starts with a dazzling title-credits sequence, courtesy again of Saul Bass, combined with a superb theme, once again from Bernard Herrman. Then the fun really begins as we're introduced to the affable ""Mad Man"", Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill, a handsome, middle-aged, snazzily-dressed advertising executive, twice divorced and if truth be told, with a bit of a mother complex. By innocently raising his hand during a meeting with clients at a swank New York hotel, just when a call goes out for an individual named George Kaplan, he is immediately swept up in an espionage plot concerning the secret exporting of state secrets to an unnamed foreign Cold War power.At the heart of these nefarious activities is the wealthy businessman Phillip Vandamm played with elan by James Mason who has in tow with him a number of besuited henchmen to do his bidding, particularly his right-hand man played with adoring devotion by Martin Landau as well as having a beautiful mistress on his arm, another classic Hitchcock blonde, this time Eva Marie Saint.The action moves along smoothly and easily, helped by sparkling, sometimes risqué dialogue especially between Grant and Saint and incorporating some of Hitchcock's most memorable set-piece sequences, especially of course the attack on Grant in the middle of nowhere by a cropduster plane and the vertigo-inducing climax atop Mount Rushmore.It's not only Hitchcock but all of his top-listed cast who are on top of their game here. Grant, still impossibly handsome in his mid-50s and wearing a suit better than anyone ever could, Saint sexy and sexually confident but with just an air of vulnerability in her compromised position, Mason coolly urbane, with a sinister edge and Landau as his homo-erotic bodyguard. Great also to see past Hitchcock supporting actors like Leo G. Carroll and Jesse Royce Landis on board for the ride with prominent parts.""North by Northwest"" brought Hitchcock to the end of the 50s, a decade where he had created a run of mostly outstanding features.

I have looked everywhere for a James Mason interview about his work on the film, about him working with Hitchcock ANYTHING and can't find it.Hitchcock always said the better the villain, the better the story. Mason's role was so smooth, elegant and seductive I think Vandamm is the ONLY villain who ever gave Cary a run for his money for the leading lady's hand. When Mason at the auction realizes Eve's real feeling for Roger his hand lifts a moment and flash of pain and understanding crosses his face. HE LOVES Eve Kendall and his pain on being betrayed is perfectly conveyed.Wow, poor Cary has one gray suit to wear through the whole movie (it is said there were a half dozen copies for all eventualities) but as male attire of the period goes James Mason looks INCREDIBLE suited out.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good movie but needs some work,"North by Northwest is a fine film, but hey, did you notice that it's over 40 years old?  I say it's due for a good ol' Hollywood remake!  Just think what can be achieved and how much better the movie can be with modern CGI and fresh, young talent.First off, casting is vital.  Cary Grant may have been an uber-stud back in the 50s, but he's way too Ward Cleaver for today's hip audience.  I recommend Will Smith or the Rock.  Replacing Eva Marie Saint would be an accomplished actress like Cameron Diaz or Jessica Simpson.  And for the villainous Vandamm, go with Agent Smith from the Matrix.  Also, I don't know what role they would play, but squeeze DMX and Jet Li in there somehow. Cause I mean, you put those two together and it's like gold every time!Now Hitchcock's plot is involving enough but it might be a bit too slow for today's kids.  Fortunately I have lots of great ideas.  In the drunk car chase scene, replace the pursuers' car with an M1 Abrams tank and instead of a convertible, Thornhill should be in either a hovercraft or a Hummer H2.The scene where Thornhill is being attacked by the cropduster is perfect; just use a stealth fighter instead, have it happen in Times Square, and have Thornhill shoot down the plane with a bazooka; oh, and it should be done all in slow-mo.

Very enjoyable and captivating.,"NORTH BY NORTHWEST is the story of a man named Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), who is mistaken for a government agent by a gang of henchmen. They kidnap him one night and drug him with bourbon, then leave him in a car destined to run off the road into the crashing waters below. Fortunately, he comes to and tells this story to the police, who investigate but find that the facts Roger give them are no longer true. He soon finds himself on the run from the police, and hides in a traveling train, where he meets the mysterious and glamorous Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), who ultimately leads him to trouble... though he does just fine getting into it on his own.This is a very enjoyable thriller, much different than most of Hitchcock's other films. The plot is pretty interesting if kind of confusing, and the execution is great. It starts off pretty slow-paced, but quickly gets very interesting and captivating with some great and classic chase scenes. The helicopter scene is unforgettable, as is the final chase scene on Mount Rushmore, which impressed me greatly.The acting is pretty good, if in that old-fashioned, melodramatic style. Cary Grant starts out kind of bland and stiff, but livens up and is great and very funny as the leading man. Eva Marie Saint is also great as the somewhat conniving, somewhat sweet Eve. The rest of the cast is good and wonderfully overdramatic in the way most actors used to perform. Of course, direction is great.NORTH BY NORTHWEST isn't quite one of Hitchcock's best, but it's very enjoyable, exciting, and fun. A deserved classic. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Definition of excellence,"I first heard about this film as I was attempting to watch the top 1000 movies of all time last Summer. I was apprehensive at first only because of the year made and the title was not appealing. After seeing that Alfred Hitchcock directed it, I was a bit relieved. Why do I think this is the greatest film of all time? (a) The plot is solid (b) The cinematography is eye candy (c) Not one hesitation in action. As I am watching the film I notice that every action sequence was original and therefore copied by every action film after 1959. Cary Grant dominates every seen. The dialog is brilliantly written and it's safe to say, no action film will ever come close to topping North by Northwest.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Suspenseful masterpiece!,"I think ""North by Northwest"" is great!  Cary Grant is his charming self as Roger Thornhill, and Eva Marie Saint is delightful as Eve Kendell.  I also think James Mason gives an excellent performance as bad guy Vandamm.My favorite part is the auction scene.  Roger knows that Vandamm's men are surrounding the place, and that he would never get out alive.  So the only way to escape is to create a disturbance, and be escorted out by the police. This is exactly what he does, and it's hilarious!Although everyone has seen the famous and climactic chase scene across Mount Rushmore, there is a great movie before and after that.  I think that this movie contains one of Hitchcock's best ""Mac Guffins"", which is an extremely slight reference to what makes the enemy so bad.  As the Professor says, Vandamm exploits ""government secrets"".  Hitchcock always said that this wasn't important to the plot, because we only need to know that Vandamm is after Roger.  I definitely recommend ""North by Northwest"" to any Hitchcock or Cary Grant fan, or someone who just wants to see an outstanding movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
North by Nor thwest,"The main thrust of the film is a deep understanding of the moral relativism and intrigue of the Cold War. But the biggest significance is that Hitchcock's film from this point on is different from his earlier works only around a suspense operation, but began to use multiple layers of suspense transformation and superposition to structure the development of the same story.At the same time, the humorous, relaxed, rich erotic style and comic temperament of the film is also an attempt by Hitchcock to distinguish himself from other works.From today's perspective, in addition to the suspenseful layers of stripping and reversing and beautiful photography, the plot of the silly and logical details of the loopholes are really regrettable.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Quick Reviews!,"Another Hitchcock classic, and further proof of his versatility, while keeping to his usual themes of deception, trust, and hidden personalities. This film has action, twists, humour, suspense, as well as great acting, and puts many recent movies which claim to 'have it all' to shame. Again, i cannot add anything which hasn't already been said, as this is a well loved classic. the set pieces that everyone knows are easily the best Hollywood produced before Bond, as are the double-entendres, and some of the dialouge is so sharp you have to rewind it to hear it again, write it down and wait for an opportunity to use it...Another film that it is difficult to find real fault with. 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A good suspense thriller,"I have been watching Alfred Hitchcock's movie nowadays. His movies are so different and fun to watch.This movie had everything a thriller crime drama should have. It was nicely made. The direction and the performances by the actors were good.

2.8.2024,"It wasn't really expected at all that Lolita star James Mason would shine in this classic, it's just that the traces of his performance in Lolita were so consistent that later viewers of North by Northwest couldn't help but instantly recognize the image of such a classic Hollywood villain.What I didn't expect was that Hitchcockian suspense would bore me so quickly; after all, such similar closed-carpet image spaces always have almost similar occurrences: a pair of love, a crime. After enjoying his excellent plotting many times again, I could not help but feel bored, and because of his outstanding lack of spirituality in his cinematic approach, I was not overly interested in adding to his work, after all, such an over-rated director to me, and then adding to him those ""psychoanalysis"" or ""phenomenology"" that he should not have had. After all, such a director, for me, has such a good reputation that adding those ""psychoanalytic"" or ""phenomenological"" labels to his work seems to be an overstepping of the bounds of their Hollywood counterparts.Unsurprisingly, Hollywood can't write any three-dimensional female characters, still so one-dimensional and thin, so attached to sex and beauty that even though we don't feel that way at the end, any previous performance seems like she's just a puppet on strings, as well as a ridiculously awkward performance at the end, which, if I were blind, I'd probably think it's okay to listen to the voices. The final clichéd to the point of being outrageously ripped off to bed is as good as giving every female character in Hollywood a set romanticized ending.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An exciting story from start to finish,"Cary Grant shines in his part as Roger Thornhill as he get mistaken for a government spy by the name of George Kaplan. Thornhill is a very interesting character as he tries to make sense of what the says do and are up too. The film is very exciting with thrills from beginning to end. Alfred Hitchcock knocked it out of the park with this film. The scenes when they were in the cars at times were quite funny though, because they were so clearly sitting in a non-moving car with green screens around them. Other then that the film is brilliantly made, and this film was one of my favorites I have seen all year",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"No Question, One of Hitchcock's Finest","A case of mistaken identity leads to kidnapping and more, in the suspenseful `North by Northwest,' directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Cary Grant.  Advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Grant) has his lunch interrupted by two men who think he's someone else, a man named Kaplan, and as they escort him from the restaurant at gunpoint to a waiting car, it's only the beginning of an adventure that will take the hapless Thornhill from New York to Mount Rushmore, and introduce him to the kind of intrigue few people experience except in the movies.  And before he's through, Thornhill will have scaled the famous monument, played tag with a crop-dusting airplane and fallen in love with a beautiful woman.  It's a classic case of an ordinary person getting caught up in extraordinary events, and with Hitchcock behind it all, you know it's going to be a thrilling ride.  And it is.With this film, Hitchcock proves once again that he is, indeed, the Master of Suspense.  With terrific foreshadowing, he has a way of tipping you off to what is about to happen, without letting you in on what's really behind the mystery.  It's part of that special touch he has that keeps it all exciting and moving along, while allowing the tension to build until the very end.  It's a precision balancing act-- keeping the story right on the wire while refusing to reveal any more than is necessary at any given point in time-- that few directors have managed to achieve so effectively. Hitchcock has an eye for detail, an innate sense of what works and knows just when to infuse some humor into his story; but a big part of his success is also that he knows how to exact the kind of performances he needs from his actors.Grant, as expected, gives a first-rate performance as Thornhill, using his natural charm and style to great effect; It's understated, and entirely credible.  His reaction to being kidnapped is totally honest, as he affects an almost naive sense of well being even with a gun stuck in his ribs.  As you can imagine it would be in a real situation like that, he simply doesn't comprehend what's really happening.  And the transition from that point to when he fully realizes the danger he's in is extremely well handled and developed.  It's a good bit of acting by Grant, and directing by Hitchcock.Also turning in notable performances are James Mason, suave and menacing as Phillip Vandamm, Thornhill's adversary, and Eva Marie Saint, as Eve Kendall, the woman Thornhill meets on a train and with whom he becomes quite taken, not only with her beauty, but by her candor, as well.The great thing about Hitchcock is that he sets you up so beautifully and never fails to deliver.  He consistently gives you that sense that something is about to happen, and it always does.  When Thornhill is standing out in the middle of nowhere at a crossroads, surrounded by nothing but fields, and you see a crop-dusting plane making a pass in the distance, and then you see it again-- but Thornhill is paying it no attention whatsoever-- you know something is up.  And from that innocuous lead in, Hitchcock develops one of his most memorable scenes ever, brilliantly conceived and realized.  The same thing happens when Thornhill and Eve find themselves at the top of Mount Rushmore; you know they didn't wind up there by accident.The supporting cast includes Jessie Royce Landis (Clara Thornhill), Leo G. Carroll (The Professor), Josephine Hutchinson (Mrs. Townsend), Philip Ober (Lester), Martin Landau (Leonard) and Edward Platt (Larrabee).  An exciting story, some engaging performances and the indelible images this film plants in your memory, all make `North by Northwest' one of Hitchcock's finest (and that's saying a lot).  Thoroughly entertaining, it's one to which you can return time and again and still be thrilled anew.  You can always rely on Hitchcock to give you a good show, and show you a good time; that's the magic of Hitchcock, and it's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enormously entertaining,"This may not be Hitch's greatest film, and it's shallow compared with, say, VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW or PSYCHO, but it is still terrifically entertaining.Continuing with a number of the ideas he used in THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS, but with a full-on Hollywood budget, this film was very influential on all the secret agent films of the sixties; from James Bond (many of the James Bond novels had been published when this film was written) via Flint and Modesty Blaise and the Man from UNCLE, right up to today's Austin Powers epics - films so dumb they don't realise they're spoofing a spoof.The world of the late fifties is conveyed in all its wacky optimism - all those clean, flat pastel surfaces - and hope for the future.  You can tell that these people - cold war or no cold war - just know that tody is better than yesterday was, and that tomorrow will be even better.Lastly; the film restoration and DVD transfer are exemplary - pin-sharp with great colour, free from telecine and digital artefacts and enhanced with excellent extra features.

"Silly by today's standard, but those standards were set by this film","I got tired of seeing all kind of references to North by Northwest in American movies and not remembering a bit of it. So I got the film and watched it. It was both exhilarating and completely goofy. I mean, it's 1959 , the clichés are different and many of the ones to come will be based on the ones in the movie.Cary Grant can't help but get the girl, his suit is almost spotless no matter what he does in it and how many days he is running by both police and bad guys in it and both FBI and baddies are pretty much ridiculous. Why did they abduct him in the first place? Why fake the death by drunk driving if they already knew he was a government agent? Why does the girl so blatantly, even by today's standards, hit on Cary Grant and he just doesn't get it's a ruse? How can one expect to successfully murder someone from a crop dusting plane using a machine-gun? Why all old guys in movies at that time come from education establishments?But at that time, it must have been great. I can imagine a remake with Ben Affleck and Scarlett Johansson. Vincent D'Onofrio as Vandamm, Martin Landau as The Professor, for continuity's sake :) Bottom line: is it the marvelously witty masterpiece of cinematography that I kind of expecting? Definitely not.

Pure cinematic perfection It's as simple as that!,"I always do something special for anniversaries, and since this is the 3.400th user comment that I write for this wonderful website, I chose to review one of the greatest movies of all-time! Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is a timeless landmark, an impeccable classic and a pure cinematic monument! Only a handful of movies are totally perfect in every tiniest detail and remain just as astounding by today's standards as when they were first released upon audiences; - more than fifty years ago in this case. Straight from the marvelous and already unforgettable opening credits, designed by the brilliant Saul Bass and provided with mind-blowing music by Bernard Herrmann, you know that this will become a highlight even in the overall magnificent repertoire of Alfred Hitchcock. The genius screenplay, written by the same guy who scripted ""The Sound of Music"" and ""West Side Story"" of all people, is a kind of James Bond story avant-la-lettre. It's a nail-bitingly tense and at times extremely grotesque conspiracy/espionage thriller in which an innocent man's identity is mistaken for that of a government spy who actually doesn't exist. The sly and overconfident advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill is abducted from a hotel lobby and taken to a fancy countryside mansion where he's forced to admit that he is George Kaplan by the foreign spy Philippe Vandamm and his rude team. Thornhill narrowly escapes a carefully planned assassination attempt, but subsequently finds himself framed for murder and pursued by the police as well as by his assailants. He travels to Chicago by train, meets the staggeringly beautiful Eve Kendall and battles for his life all across America, until the final confrontation takes place on top of the Mount Rushmore monument. Now, it's already immensely difficult to bring a genuine edge-of- your-seat suspense thriller, but this film is simultaneously also comical! The humor in the screenplay of ""North by Northwest"" is constant, subtle and dry. The dialogs between Cary Grant and Eve Saint Marie are a terrific example of this, but also the performances of Martin Landau (as the main villain's evil sidekick) and Jessie Royce Landis (as Grant's skeptical mother) are blackly humorous. The action sequences are phenomenal, with the legendary crop dusting airplane chase sequence as the absolute highlight, and the climax is unforgettable. ""North by Northwest"" is just downright perfect; it's as simple as that.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Suspense from Beginning to End,"There is something comforting about a Hitchcock film.  We know that no matter how serious the events are, there is a wonderfully complex plot, comic relief, and great actors to pull it all off.  The spoiled, inebriated Roger Thornhill, like so many of the master's everymen, finds himself thrust into a world he must escape, while, at the same time, trying to figure it all out.  His arrogance is what gets him deeper and deeper into trouble, but it is also what saves him.  Cary Grant is the only actor I could think of who is so suave and yet so combative and self centered.  As he realizes what is happening he must constantly face death, while being manipulated by the powers that be. He is being set up, he knows, but by whom?  Enter Eva Marie Saint, but knowing Hitchcock, she is to be watched carefully as well. Most of Hitchcock's ""victims"" reach a point where they won't take any more.  I love the way Thornhill has been put in a predicament where he has no confederates and must remain underground.  Everyone back home thinks he is the irresponsible drunk he truly is.  Even his mother isn't to surprised to find out he may be a murderer.  The use of settings around Rapid City, Mount Rushmore, all the Hitchcock signatures, make this one of the best, if not the best, if all his films.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Blueprint,"In terms of influence, there are few that can be looked at as more important to film than North by Northwest.

The visuals are far superior to most of its contemporaries but it isn't enough to blow the viewer away like in Vertigo, for example, and the acting leaves something to be desired.

Surprisingly Disappointing,"I didn't realize it was a Hitchcock film, discovering that it was, was disappointing. It should've been so much better! The cars were awesome, but the story was absurd in several ways. A poorly written concept that defies logic in numerous ways some completely absurd. Using a crop duster? This was stupidity on and amplified level, sending Gila monsters would've made as much sense. The Mount Rushmore scene was completely absurd. Still, it definitely had a nostalgic allure, but could've easily been so much better had some thought gone into the writing. All the rave reviews are completely mystifying to me, as is the case with much in this world. Still, it's well worth a watch in spite of the nonsense.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock at his zenith,"In my opinion, North by Northwest is the high point in Hitchcock's career, a Mt. Everest of film making with another high peak on each side - Vertigo and Psycho.This is one of the most perfect movies I have ever seen - full of plot twist after plot twist, the most interesting characters to ever grace the screen, and marvelous set pieces.As soon as the movie begins, we are thrust into the life of Roger Thornhill, who we spend almsot every scene of the movie with.  We know at once that he is a conniving adman, but under it all, he is a nice guy, and about the most sympathetic hero of any movie.  The bad guys are as evil as they come, and Eva Marie Saint may not be Grace Kelly, but perhaps that makes it better. Audiences may not have accepted Grace Kelly in that role.The setpieces.... so great!  the Hotel, the UN, the TRAIN!, the auction scene, and Mt. Rushmore are all great, but none are quite as superb as the cropdusting sequence.  I've seen the movie at least 5 times, and I never realized that it's kind of gratuitous until I read a comment about Torn Curtain and gratuitous characters/scenes.  That's how well this movie works - everything seems right and nothing seems out of place.  Even the one noticable blooper - the kid who put his fingers over his ears before the gunshot - it doesn't tarnish the movie at all.I understand why Ben-Hur won 11 oscars for the year 1959 - it was an epic film and it is done well, but North By Northwest was the best movie of that year, if not the entire 1950's.Cary Grant was the coolest guy ever and is the quintessential ""everyman"". That on top of every aspect of this movie being perfect makes it Hitch's most appealing work.  It doesn't break new ground, but it is so brilliantly conceived and executed, that it is no wonder it is on so many top 10 and top 100 lists.  Everyone should see this movie more than once.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock's Most Enjoyable Film.,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" (1959) is not his best film. It dose not have the intensity and thought provoking treatment that his ""Vertigo"" (1959) has. However, this is missing the point. ""North By Northwest"" was devised as entertainment, not art, which ""Vertigo"" is quite possibly is, so, trying to read meanings in this film is pointless. ""North By Northwest"" is the most enjoyable film the Master of Suspense ever created, finding the perfect hero in Cary Grant, who memorable encounters including the now iconic crop-duster scene and drunken drive along Long Island's coast. ""North By Northwest"" has echos from as far back as his ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Saboteur"", but it always feels fresh and exciting. A true masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Classic Hitchcock,"This is a very entertaining Alfred Hitchcock film, it has all the twists and turns you would expect from the director and is great escapist fun.

Still thats a minor quibble as this is film is excellent in every other way, James Mason and Martin Landau are especially good as the bad guys and the music is excellent. This film also contains one of the finest scenes in cinematic history as Grant waits by a roadside apparently waiting to meet someone. Also the Bond films seem to have been heavily influenced by this film especially From Russia With Love.

North by Northwest is an outstanding piece of filmmaking with well-written and executed nuances,"I recently revisited the Hitchcock classic North by Northwest (1959) on Tubi. The plot revolves around an executive kidnapped in a case of mistaken identity, accused of murder, and pursued by individuals who believe he is a spy. The executive strives to uncover the true target and clear his name.Directed by the iconic Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho), the film features stellar performances from Cary Grant (Charade), Eva Marie Saint (On the Waterfront), Martin Landau (Ed Wood), and James Mason (Lolita).This is a sophisticated Hitchcock film with impeccable attire, captivating dialogue, intriguing characters, and tense situations. It exudes a Hitchcockian Bond film vibe, with Grant delivering a charming and authentic performance, although some lines with Marie Saint felt awkward (I can't always see Grant as a womanizer). The action scenes, though a bit dated, shine, especially the iconic train and plane sequences. The stab scene is well-executed, drawing the audience in the film and keeping you glued to the events. Numerous clever twists and a somewhat predictable but satisfying ending contribute to the overall appeal.In conclusion, North by Northwest is an outstanding piece of filmmaking with well-written and executed nuances. I would give it an 8/10 and highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
North by Northwest (1959),"A film that surprises me every time I see it. This will constantly be one of my favorite films as it is a constant barrage of hits. The film perfectly matches screwball comedy, raunchy romance (without ever getting too sexy), action, and mysterious suspense. A trick in recent films is to confuse the audience until the very end, where needless exposition happens. Hitchcock was a master of mysteries because he knew how many unanswered questions to have on the go at any one time, and when to answer them. As the film progresses, new plot twists arrive, making it an interesting and intriguing film. At the beginning, we are as clueless as Grant, but as the film goes on, we see more and more , gradually making us more informed than Grant. This clever respect for the audience means we are never talked down to. The action scenes are as fantastic today as they ever were. The slow build up to the plane scene is the kind of patience lacking in today's shaky cam world. North by Northwest is a perfect movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Hitchcock brilliantly combines drama and thrills in the movie with no boring fillers that captivates the audience from start to finish. There is also humor in abundance, most notable being Cary Grant's quick comebacks and wit, which puts in added charm and laughter to this thriller.

An advertising agent Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a non-existent and virtual government agent George Kaplan and chased around the country by agents and he finds ways to survive them all with a bit of humor and an affair with another mysterious agent Eva Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).This Alfred Hitchcock movie has the typical stamp of all Alfred Hitchcock movies. It is fast paced, it is set in urban areas, it has mystery and suspense, it has good humor and it has some good sets.Some scenes are memorable, the first when Alfred makes his cameo in the beginning of the movie when he misses catching a city bus, the glider plane scene that comes to attack Cary Grant, and the final action against the backdrop of Statues of Great American Presidents. All of them make great viewing. I could imagine with Hitchcock and Cary in their prime popularity would have raked great reviews when the movie would had been released.Today, after 48 years  the movie still remains watch-able, pleasant, and over-all a good cinematic experience; but surely it does not give the same amount of classic mastery feel that some other Hitchcockian movies has.The drunken driving scene of Cary Grant is so poorly executed with Cary overacting to the hilt of affairs and looks so artificial, un-natural and over-dramatic. Otherwise Cary Grant has charming personality. Seeing Eva Marie Saint reminded me of Julia Roberts  Julia Roberts rise to fame must have to do with the type of looks she has  typical American Hollywood heroines.The music as in all Hitchcock movie is very Jazz and Mozart type  especially in chase and action scenes.A good movie, but I won't agree it being a great classic by the master.(Stars 6.5 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

No only is the music bad, but the dialogue is terrible, and Eva Marie Saint, who looks likes she has flashbulbs in her eyes, speaks so slowly and in such a monotone it's hard to believe Hitchcock would consider her for that role. The plot keeps getting stranger and stranger and all about two spies who don't seem to walk around with bodyguards or are armed themselves. Too many coincidences, and not enough intrigue. Sorry.
IN ADDITION, there is a point where Grant goes through Eva Marie's personal stuff and musingly finds her very small shaving brush and very small shaver. He later uses them in the bathroom of the Rail Road station and it seems to take him an extra amount of time to shave. Is this a reference to the fact that Eva Marie is such a hot woman that she shaves her ladies' parts and uses these small instruments? Does that make her hotter. Or is my dirty mind just rolling away with me.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A True Classic,"An advertising executive is unsuspectingly setup by intelligence to pose as a decoy to a spy who supposedly, but doesn't exist. The suspense and thrills are great. And I especially like that frightening sequence in the airport after Thornhill asks Townsend ""Do you recognize this man?"" And then Townsend's eyes suddently bulge... and - well, I won't spoil that scene just yet.I just wished that the fact that Thornhill was divorced by his ex's because of his living a dull life was foreshadowed more extensively. but I guess they couldn't have because as they say: START WHEN YOUR STORY STARTS. And I dont think it can count as a plothole or a flaw.You can see how Lehman crafts his story with care, precision and how he waits for that scene in the end where Eve reveals why she works for intelligence, and why she decided to cooperate. -- ""Has life always been like that?""Very interesting to see Thornhill's character arc. Watch how he pretends to have forgotten about Eve in the hospital. Watch what he does when CIA old man steps out to get him his drink. There's also a quick, funny scene where the woman in glasses goes ""STOP...... I mean.... Stop.""I especially like Bernard Hermann's thrilling score. It has such an exhilirating, and sometimes hypnotic mood to it --- It's played in the beginning, in the scene where the intoxicated Roger tries to drive thru the hills, and in the movie's finale in Mt. Rushmore.Nowadays, its often hard to find an action film that's can be very solid, plausible and maybe have a feel-good aspect at the end.10/10         or       GRADE A++A classic indeed.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"""War is hell ... even when it's a cold one.""","""North by Northwest"" is Alfred Hitchcock's film about Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who is mistaken for a secret agent and becomes entangled in a web of intrigue. The film shows the world of espionage as dangerous yet glamorous, making this in some ways a precursor to the James Bond films which would come soon after. However, ""North by Northwest"" has a stronger degree of intrigue and characterization than is seen in any Bond film.Cary Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill with all the necessary charm and Eva Marie Saint is likewise perfect as the enigmatic Eve Kendall and the chemistry between the two is extraordinary. The supporting performances are also strong: James Mason as the forceful Vandamm, Martin Landau and Vandamm's other lackeys and even Jessie Royce Landis as Thornhill's generally unimpressed mother. Leo G. Carroll also deserves note as his look and demeanor fit very well with his role as ""The Professor"".The story is effective at being enticing early with its tantalizing premise and developing with enough intrigue and characterization to keep it engaging. The action scenes, in particular two famous ones, are well-staged, tense and unorthodox to a degree that keeps them interesting. There is also a lot of well-placed humor injected into the film in between the moments of intrigue and action. ""North by Northwest"" should satisfy those looking for those seeking a spy film with a strong amount intrigue and characterization and those seeking a spy film well-paced with notable action scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An Excellent movie,"Always one of my favourite films of all time.Just watched it again on the digitally re-mastered Blu-Ray version and it looks absolutely brilliant! - like it was filmed yesterday.I love films with a bit of intrigue, excellent plot and script, perhaps some romance, and a journey. North by Northwest has all of these in spades.Classic images - from the magnificent Grand Central Station in New York, the iconic train, 1959 original cars and dress, to Mount Rushmore. It's just brilliant. Even the music - classic Hollywood style, adds to it all.Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill gives his best performance. He has an arresting script to work from and is able to show a refreshing dry sense of humour throughout;Roger Thornhill : My wives divorced me.Eve Kendall : Why?Roger Thornhill : They said I led too dull a life.Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall is beautiful; dresses superbly (particularly in red and black at the hotel in Chicago). How curious 1960's American audiences must have found it to see a woman playing the central role as a gun-toting spy-catcher.

The Popcorn Flick of Hitchcock Movies,"North by Northwest reminds me of Vertigo more than any of the other Hitchcock movies that I've seen. Both of them are his versions of ""blockbusters"", with the pacing and action scenes of a good summer movie. I enjoyed both of them to about the same degree, as well.It's a pretty thrilling ride, I must say. A case of mistaken identity leads Cary Grant into a web of narrow escapes, murders, espionage, chases, and general peril. He meets the requisite icy blonde along the way (who may be friend or foe), and most of the other Hitchcockian flourishes are present in some degree.North by Northwest is also pretty damn funny. I laughed more than a few times at Grant's pithy quips and his mutually aggressive banter with Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall. Who just happens also be another gorgeous woman in a leading Hitchcock role. Who could have guessed?This is a pretty good movie for anyone unfamiliar with Alfred Hitchcock to start with. It's entertaining enough in traditional ways that it will appeal to people who may have yet to become addicted to Hitchcock's style. I say ""yet"", because North by Northwest will probably speed you on your way to becoming hooked.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An almost perfect thriller,"Non-stop suspense, action and humour.  I gave this a 9 out of 10. Cary is at his best here and should have had an Oscar (hard to believe that that particular year it went to one note Charlton Heston!).  I would have loved to have seen Grace Kelly portray the Kendall role, she would have delivered the ice Eve Marie Saint tried and did not quite succeed in pulling off. All the support bits are great - I recognise so many stock players from this movie.  I have never seen it on the big screen and would love to, the Mount Rushmore sequence, the U.N., the train, the coast, and of course the crop-dusting scenes would look so much better on full screen.  James Mason is great and also Martin Landau in his first role.  Quite daring for 1959 in its implied sexuality - though I understand that one of Eve's lines on the train was dubbed over as being too risque - she apparently says ""I never make love on an empty stomach"" and that is dubbed to ""I don't discuss making love...."" one for the trivia books.

I am happy to say that my expectations were not only met, they were surpassed. This is another GREAT Hitchcock film. Cary Grant's talent is especially showcased here. His dry wit and delivery of his (well-written) lines made me literally laugh out loud in places.

A thrilling action/adventure whose reach somewhat exceeds its grasp,"While not quite Hitchcock's best, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is nevertheless one of his most thrilling, and funny, motion pictures. It stars Cary Grant as an ad executive who gets mistaken for a government agent and has to go on the run in order to survive. Sound familiar? That's because the plot is kind of similar to Hitchcock's own SABOTEUR and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (although you can be certain that Cary Grant's character didn't; the bad guys just think he does). This simple premise provided for a myriad of exciting set-pieces that exemplify the kind of suspense-building and thrills that Hitch's audience were most certainly used to by this point in his career. Cary Grant is quite a good replacement for the everyman character that James Stewart played so well, and Eva Marie Saint plays a nice twist on the femme fatale as this film's Hitchcock blonde. Still, what struck me so much was how funny this film was. At certain points, it was like watching a comedy of errors combined with a spy thriller. There was also a lot more obvious sexual innuendo than in any Hitchcock picture I've seen before. Signs of the changing times, maybe? Moving on, even though it wasn't as tightly written as some of Hitchcock's other films, being essentially a bunch of action set-pieces strung together, it was still rather inventive and the momentum was kept going at a pretty good pace throughout. In particular, the crop-dusting scene and the climactic sequence on Mount Rushmore stand out from the rest, as I'm sure they do to many others who've seen the film. However, what made this not quite as perfect as could have been has a lot do with Hitchcock's tendency to do a lot of shooting on sound stages. As a result, a car chase that takes place early on (with a drunk Cary Grant) was less thrilling and believable than it could have been, and Bernard Herrmann's score had to compensate (a little too much, perhaps). And, the villains this time around weren't as memorable, mostly because we don't really see them do anything villainous. Still, James Mason was a pleasure to watch, and we get to see Martin Landau play a heavy. Overall, I do think this is better than the previous Hitchcock films I mentioned, if for no other reason than that there's more of what worked in those films. Still, at 136 minutes, it is a little too long and, like many other of Hitchcock's movies I've seen, the ending was too abrupt and a little bit of a cheat. So, while its reach does somewhat exceed its grasp in terms of the action, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is still a suitably thrilling action/adventure that ranks among the most entertaining that Hitchcock ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"When It Comes to Thrillers, Alfred Hitchcock is Second to None.","Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest features a spellbinding first half which makes terrific use of clever humour, elevated tension & elements of mystery or suspense but is unfortunately marred by a lacklustre second half which bogs the story down with a dragged narrative & feels slightly overlong in the end although it does have one spectacular sequence that'll be etched in memory once it's seen.One of the first films to lay down the foundation of modern action thrillers in Hollywood, North by Northwest is a thrilling tale of mistaken identity which concerns an innocent advertising executive who is mistaken for a government agent by an organisation of foreign spies & is pursued by them. The story covers his journey of survival as danger & betrayal await at every corner.Although the film is nicely directed & does boast some high moments, it nonetheless ends up feeling like a mixed bag as the story ends up overstaying its welcome and the ending feels more extended than it was required. The screenplay is deftly written, camera-work is dynamic from its opening moments, editing could've paced the second half better & Bernard Herrmann's score is expertly composed.Coming to the performances, Cary Grant is absolutely professional in his role & dons the character's suit smoothly. Plus, he is wonderfully supported by other actors who deliver fine performances in their given roles. On an overall scale, North by Northwest is an intriguing & entertaining flick from Hitchcock that didn't work out for me as well as I would've liked but is still an effective example of its genre that's definitely worth a watch.",,Anonymous,Mystery

An enjoyable thriller,"In Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" an advertising executive (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a non-existent government agent and is forced to go on the run following a botched murder and subsequent framing. Along the way he meets an alluring stranger (Eva Marie Saint) but it remains to be seen whether she is friend or foe.I wasn't bowled over by the storyline, which is pretty standard thriller material. Of course, I'm not much of a fan of thrillers in the first place so you can take my lack of enthusiasm with a grain of salt. Still, it cannot be denied that the plot has several similarities with other, earlier Hitchcock films, making this a sort of 'definitive' Hitchcock film.The cast is solid with Grant & Saint ably handling the lead roles though it is James Mason as the suave, villainous Phillip Vandamm who gives the most memorable performance. Martin Landau, as Vandamm's right-hand man, is also notable though his role is a minor one. There was one odd bit of casting, though; that of Mrs. Thornhill, who appears to be about the same age as her son. Surely casting could have found someone more appropriate.Unsurprisingly, the direction is top-notch and there's also a tense Bernard Herrmann score to augment the action. I was surprised that the tone of the film was so sexually suggestive and I grinned when I recognized the connotation of the film's final shot. Sure, it's tame by today's standards but it all seems slightly risqué for '59.In my opinion this is an enjoyable film though I'm not sure that I'd label it as one of the greats of all time. In any case, it should certainly be seen at least once and then you can make your own decision.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Highly enjoyable but far from realistic thriller,"Greetings from Lithuania.""North by Northwest"" (1959) is more like an adventure with some mystery and thriller elements than a real thriller - it has this lightness that separates it from more serious approach of the material. And maybe that's is the strangeness and at the same time the weakness of this great and exciting movie. It is superbly photographed, features splendid cinematography (the scene with the plane in the fields is simply amazing, still after first time seeing this movie in 2015). Acting is very solid but not very serious, you won't believe for a second that one of the characters were experiencing a real peril, it is more like acting in front of the camera, not ""beeing there sort of acting"". While the story is intriguing at first, it becomes more or less intriguing by the end, and although i really enjoyed the last sequence on the monument, some acting in there weren't just that good or realistic.Overall, ""North by Northwest"" is a definitely a great movie, but more of its parts are great that the whole. It has great comedic moments, especially by Cary Grant. Eva Marie Saint is more powerful in dramatic scenes rather that in action scenes, she isn't convincing in those, she is dramatic actress, not an action heroines. Directing is solid here (by legendary Alfred Hitchcock!).

The 39 Steps/Saboteur/North by Northwest,"Hitchcock made this movie three times: the first was released in 1935 called ""The 39 Steps"", the second in 1942 called ""Saboteur"", and the third in 1959 named ""North by Northwest"".The basic ingredients are: (1) A lonely man wrongfully accused of something he didn't do. (2) His wanting to have himself in the clear. (3) His incapacity of turning his case over to justice. (4) His pursuit of the party who incriminated him. (5) His involvement in between with a blond girl that he can't trust.

What an Action Thriller Should Be,"'North by Northwest' must have caught Hitch's eye from the start--it's so typical of the kind of film he loved to make (a man on the run from unseen or unknown enemies).

Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are perfect in the leads and James Mason and Martin Landau are highly satisfactory villains.It's all great fun, with Grant mistaken in the opening scene for a Federal Intelligence agent who doesn't really exist. He is soon swept up in a an amusing and suspenseful twist of plot complications involving spies and counterspies with an unpredictable series of nail-biting scenes that never let up until the smashing climax at Mount Rushmore. The dust-cropping scene is a highlight, skillfully edited and photographed for maximum effect.As usual, the suspense begins with the opening credits as Bernard Herrmann's staccato notes of music prepare us for what follows.

Grant's nightmare is our gain,"***Nycritic has an interesting discussion comparing NXNW with the James Bond franchise (""What an Action Thriller Should Be"", nycritic, 11 April 2005). Also, Ian Harrison has a good discussion about identification with Cary Grant (""Top-notch suspense /adventure film still looks great after 40 years!"", Ian Harrison from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, 25 December 2000).***""North by Northwest"" (1959, Alfred Hitchcock), a travelogue, has inspired many. This includes Ian Fleming who created the character of James Bond as a derivation of Cary Grant's Roger O. Thornhill. Many young filmmakers have also studied this film to unlock its secrets. Despite its ludicrous plot (which is a Hitchcock characteristic), it is overflowing with style. NXNW is exquisitely fine art with strong appeal to the masses. Someday, Alfred Hitchcock may dislodge William Shakespeare in public regard.As with every film by the Master, each image was carefully designed before the filming. The sequences are dazzling with precision. The sublime crop-duster, auction, drunken-driving and Mount Rushmore scenes all reach a level of quality that is hard to believe. NXNW is of course, best viewed on the big screen. Since the Charles Theater has completed renovating its showcase theater this is a great opportunity to luxuriate in the new seats and experience a real gem.There are sight gags aplenty. We know from Francois Truffaut's famous interview with him that visually Hitchcock was mocking Grant's sexuality. Ergo, making Cary appear uninterested in women is a prominent visual leitmotif. (Although he always denied it, Grant was widely believed in Hollywood to be bisexual. He shared a house for a decade with fellow actor Randolph Scott, and the two were often observed relaxing as if they were lovers. It seems worth noting that the media of the 1930s largely let ""sleeping dogs lie""; i.e., Grant suffered little exposure in the press. It may be difficult for people living in this Peeping Tom era to imagine the privacy people in the 1930s enjoyed.)Here, Cary Grant is never better. The rest of the cast is noteworthy. Silky-voiced James Mason (as Phillip Vandamm) is wonderful to listen to. Hitchcock's villains are always charming, but Mason's particular voice is so sonorous it is the perfect antidote to Grant's mega-watt charisma. Eva Marie Saint (age: 35) is also very effective as a sultry spy. Martin Landau plays the obviously homosexual assistant to Van Damm. Leo G. Carroll, the actor with the most appearances in Hitchcock films (5), is the sympathetic spy master. Jessica Royce Landis, (believed to be) only 8 years older than Grant, plays his mother with comedic flair. Bernard Hermann provides another great film score.Studio executives quarreled with Hitchcock over NXNW's running time (136 minutes). The bean counters wanted to trim scenes, particularly Cary and Eva Marie in the woods. Hitchcock had his way because his contract granted him final cut. Good thing the brief hospital scene was not left out. When a startled female patient immediately falls in love with passing-through Grant, the moment never fails to bring laughter. Even today, Cary Grant will likely poll as the most handsome actor in cinema history.The last time I saw NXNW screened in a theater I was very surprised how much more thrilling and emotionally warm experiencing it is instead of watching it on a TV screen. The next time this appears at a movie house near you, do not hesitate to arrive by bus, cab, train and airplane to experience it; avoiding offensive crop-duster pilots on the journey.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"An answer to this finding a Hitchcock ""mistake""","I just saw the movie too for the 1st time and won't bother to spend time talking about its many memoriable moments or strong points. 10 out of 10. But I do want to talk about what some other IMDB members have mentioned about the possible error Hitchcock made by revelaing a movie ""secret"" too early in the film (SPOLIERS AHEAD!!!) After watching many Hitchcock films and taking a class at my college last year on classic cinema, I learned of a trm called HITCHCOCKIAN SUSPENSE. It's not suspense like that way you tink of where we're nervous if a character is going to sin the big game or survive a fight. It's where we the viewer know of a secret that one of the cahracters on screen has no idea about. It adds another twist to watching the movie because we know somehting they don't and we want to yell at the screen, ""You idiot! Can't you figure it out!"" By filling us in on the non-existant Kaplan early on in the film, we still undersatnd Cary Grant's obsession with finding the real Kaplan because we were just in the same boat as him. But now we're forced to see him try against in search that's in vain. You can see stuff like this in ""Nototious"" and ""Strangers on a train"" also. Also, I loved the scene where the professor explains the Kaplan truth to Thornhill, so we stil lget to see his expression when he finds out but the roar of the airplane covers it so we're spared hearing the same shpiel twice. Also, I think Hitch may be thinking ahead, knowing that he still has some great ""revelations"" to make later on in the film like revealing Eve is undercover, when the bad guys figure that out, and the whole Thornhill gets shot scene. Discovering there's no Kaplan at that point of the movie would have been overkill and too much info to handle right then.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Combining that element of chase, espionage and sheer horror combined with action; North By Northwest is a winner.","North by Northwest manages to cover just about every emotion you might feel during a good, old fashioned romp. There are scenes in the film of great, comic timing; there are sequences when you are frightened for the characters; there are times when you're frustrated or angry at certain occurrences and there are others when the film dips into potential romance and you experience the emotions that come with that. The whole film-watching experience is, of course, juxtaposed by Cary Grant's relaxed and somewhat methodical approach to everything – encouraging a certain ease on the audience, like a parent or guardian comforting a child with the words ""it's only a movie"" every so often.North By Northwest reminded me of a film from 1945 named 'Detour', a short, sharp and quite brilliant little B-movie. But Hitchcock knows what he's doing here, shooting and constructing North by Northwest as the sort of film you mightn't expect many people to turn up for; shooting and constructing it like the sort of film that, if a lot of people did turn up, wouldn't expect an awful lot out of. Hitchcock throws caution to the wind, dabbling in and out of a couple of genres; twisting audience emotion and redefining film language all at once.Very early on in the film, we are established to be on a busy New York street. Cary Grant's lead character named Roger Thornhill walks, talks and mingles with whoever he needs to as other pedestrians try to get the better of others on a minute scale by hogging the pavement as they get on with whatever they're doing. The opening establishes a few things, namely Roger's quick wit and ability to gauge scenarios in fast moving and bustling locations. This is put across via the incidence during which he manages to hail a cab amidst the chaos and acts as a precursor for things to come when his skills will be pushed to much further extremes. Incidentally, the beginning is supposed to get across this chaotic 'world' full of 'one-upmanship', in which the film will take place, further in which people exist to get the better of one another. The notion of a busy street on which you must keep your wits about you purely to be able to walk without hassle is Hitchcock fore-warning the themes of the film's narrative, a film in which there will be 'others' out looking to damage those un-alert, and it is Thornhill's own qualities that ultimately take him as far as he goes.The set up involves mistaken identity and Thornhill getting snatched from a prior arrangement by some thugs to meet a certain Phillip Vandamm (Mason), who mistakes him for someone else named George Kaplan. Through one reason or another, and an early example of Hitchcock deliberately veering off into some sort of realm of horror, Thornhill is dumped and left for dead by the thugs, but takes it on himself to figure out who Kaplan really is. What follows is a framing for murder and a 'A 3000 MILE CHASE . . . That blazes a trail of TERROR to a gripping, spine-chilling climax!'; at least according to the tag-line – but you'd be pretty hard pressed not to agree with the statement anyway.From here, North by Northwest doesn't really let up. Its countless inspirations since can range from anything from Three Days of the Condor, to the film THAT inspired ie; The Bourne Identity to a similarly easy-on-the-eye-and-mind 2004 B-Movie entitled Cellular. The cause and effect driven idea shoots from one location to another, incorporating all sorts of frightening but entertaining ideas and scenes. The film pauses for sexual tension, laughs and thrills in equal measure; never loosing sight of its Cold War era driven aura of espionage, politics, mistaken identity and chase.Following the framing for murder, Thornhill travels to Chicago for what should be a meeting Kaplan was due to attend. It is on the train travelling to this destination he meets Eve Kendall (Saint), a character Hitchcock brilliantly sets up by having her recognise Thornhill as the man wanted by police but refrains from turning him in. The very dangerous persona that is set up for Eve is confirmed when, in addition to not particularly flinching when she discovers who Thornhill is, she quite easily lies to police regarding Thornhill's whereabouts by hiding him in a her train compartment.As the film develops, particular narrative ideas to do with undercover agents and microfilms open up but I find it remarkable that this film, with all the elements of paranoia and mistaken identity with somewhat of a labyrinth of a narrative that opens up in due course, seems to be mostly remembered for its individual scenes: a crop dusting chase, an escape on Mount Rushmoor and a particularly eye-brow raising final shot. We all know about Psycho and the shower scene and who gets killed there and what the twist is; we all know about Rear Window and that a certain someone is in a helpless physical position as things tighten around them, but here, popular culture hasn't seemed to have ruined what is, essentially, a really well played out thriller with plot twists, turns and frightening set pieces. While always seemingly remembered for individual moments, North by Northwest is a truly wonderful picture that presents a genuinely likable lead; throws them into the firing line; develops other characters accordingly and rounds it all off with a brilliantly unravelled plot complete with current affairs for the day, surely one of Hitchcock's finest.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Master Of Suspense At His Finest,"If you've never had the pleasure of seeing an Alfred Hitchcock film (especially one of his best),this is the one for you to discover by the master of suspense,as he became widely known as. Cary Grant stars as a Madison Avenue executive who becomes a pawn by a spy organization,set up as a murder suspect,and skirts the country,hoping to find the answers to just why he's being set up. Toss in the requisite Hitchcock blonde beauty (Eva Marie Saint),and lots of plot twists, and you got yourself the formula for a white knuckled thriller. The film has some scenes that have become legendary,if not outright iconic (Grant being pursued by a crop duster airplane,the suspenseful scenes at Mount Rushmore,etc.). Hats off to musical director/composer, Bernard Hermann for crafting a music score that compliments the film nicely (as does his other musical scores for not just Hitchcock,but other films he wrote & arranged music for). The film is also a treat for the eye,filmed in the original Technicolor process & shot in the sadly now defunct 'Vistavision' process (another special wide screen process that Paramont seemed to have the copyright for,but allowed M-G-M to implement for this one film,only). If you hear of this fine film playing in your area (especially if it's an original Technicolor & Vistavision print), run, don't walk to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Stupendous Achievement and Highly Satisfactory Entertainment,"Just after the title sequence designed by Saul Bass, the opening shots immediately bring to mind the hallmarks of the movie's director, the Master of Suspense whose stories memorably imprisoned the characters in a world of wit, suspense, drama, erotic overtones and highly manipulative emotions. Along with the Expressionist influence on his movies and certain bases created within the walls of Hollywood system, the director's highly sophisticated, unique style pursued within a span of a few decades but, foremost, his frankness towards viewers made Hitchcock stand a test of time. And with his ""sardonic, mischievous wit"" and the ""magnetism of his casts"" (Carter B. Horsley), including Ernest Lehmann's witty and clever script, NORTH BY NORTHWEST appears to be Hitchcosk's milestone and ""perhaps his most fully realized film."" (Charles Ramirez Berg).All seems to be around an old Hollywood saying: ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl after all."" And although this saying appears to find its resemblance within the themes of many movies, when supplied with Hitch's suspense, it results in stupendous achievement and a highly satisfactory entertainment.To start with, it appears that most of the movie's charm and strength lies in the lead performance by Cary Grant as a ""man on Lincoln's nose,"" likable Roger Thornhill. Unlike James Stewart, Cary Grant, the prototype of the ideal man and a man-bridge of generations at the turn of periods, supplies us with the most crucial aspects of good performance. He is wonderfully witty, outstandingly skilled, almost an athlete on the screen, a perfect leading man as well as the actor capable of bringing about the very best thrills and putting emotional resonance into the story. His performance is so powerful that we, as viewers, simply skip certain flaws in the story. He is never too much overwhelmed by the role, never too easily taken with emotions and by that his role remains one of the most authentic achievements on the screen. Being his fourth role under the direction of Alfred Hitchcock, he proves excellent rapport with the Master of Suspense. The director's sense of humor goes perfectly well with Grant's comic skills, the director's style goes well with Grant's mystique, the director's psychological overtones and hidden meanings go beautifully with the actor's subtle, transcending acting abilities. The best moments include the drunkard's driving (which B Horsley rightly labels as ""pure buffoonery"") and the art auction, a typical Hitch-like scene of a public event interrupted. No wonder Pauline Kael once pointed out that Grant ""appeared before us in his radiantly shallow perfection and that is all we wanted of him.""FEMALE CO-STARS: Hitchock's preferences of beautiful blonds on the screen does not meet any exception in NORTH BY NORTHWEST. It is no Grace Kelly or Ingrid Bergman, but an actress who can perfectly stand a chance against lots of expectations and requirements of the more demanding audiences, Eva Marie Saint as a 26 year-old Eve Kendall. She manages to give a performance that initiates a true clash of senses: radiantly awesome whilst being a stranger on a train so much taken with the man's face, stunningly captivating whilst being a spy within a more organized institutionalized group, undeniably sexy capable of bringing all erotic thoughts to life whilst being totally dressed. The best moments include the train sequence, in my opinion. That sequence brings all to heights of witty intelligence and a great touch of climbing up and proving to him why she has been so good to the man. The two (Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant) appear to embody contrast themselves, contradiction of loneliness vs togetherness. ""Boy gets girl after all and loneliness happily leads to togetherness...Among the supporting cast, each viewer will surely be stunned by the performance of James Mason, ""deliciously pernicious"" with ""cool elegance and authority"" (B. Horsley) drawing parallels to James Bond's villains. His scenes are ostentatiously cold and innately captivating. The theme of a mummy's boy is developed by Jessie Royce Landis who plays the protagonist's mother in some hilarious moments. Martin Landau is also interesting in his early role as Leonard.Amidst the merits of the movie, two points need a special mention: excellent shots that Alfred Hitchcock was famous for and the score by Bernard Herrman. It's no need to say how beautifully the tunes correspond to the action, the whole storytelling, how balanced the score is and how strongly it teases our imagination, our assumptions, gently caressing our senses. The shots reveal grandeur at Glen Cove estate but reach the pinnacle at Mount Rushmore sequence which has revealed much of the director's haunting flair for Expressionism. So much as the Golden Gate Bridge is a silent character of VERTIGO, Mt Rushmore serves that purpose in NORTH BY NORTHWEST, being even more...an unforgettable crescendo of the finale.While seeing NORTH BY NORTHWEST after a few decades, you have this unusual feeling that you are watching something unique, something that may still entertain you, enthrall you, touch you, amuse you and, foremost, bring all the thrill of suspense to a unique scale of perceptions. Charles Ramirez Berg put it nicely in his article highlighting Hitchock's legacy that ""this quintessential chase movie is full of the things for which we remember Alfred Hitchcockl..."" What are the things? No need to enumerate them, just see the film and find for yourself/yourselves.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great opening, but otherwise unwatchable","I thought I'd catch up on this classic as I've never seen it. The opening sequence is fabulous, with the music of Bernard Herrmann and the manic streets of new York - look out for the Hitchcock cameo. But when it came to the scene on the train when he's kissing the woman who's hiding him - frankly, it was unwatchable, and I had to switch it off. I mean, he's old enough to be her father!There are some great location scenes in the opening scenes: Grand Central Station, and the UN building, all in glorious colour. The music by Bernard Hermann is of course a classic.So don't let me put you off, you might enjoy it, if you can stomach the kissing scene.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Go ahead, vote me down","My favourite film at age 10, I watched it again with mounting dismay. The whole thing now looks badly dated and Cary Grant is just too old and stiff for the part - his mother looked like his younger sister. Cotton or Holden would have done it better. The romance scenes are just horrible, and Hitch was never any good at comedy. The Technicolor (or whatever process it was) turns Grant's face bright orange and Eva Marie Saint's face bright pink, which is quite startling when they are in a clinch. Hermann's score helps but it's only James Mason who redeems things - he only has to speak to raise the quality a notch. But to be brutally frank, nothing was really working. The tension failed to mount. What action there was was arthritic. The gf actually fell asleep during the crop-duster scene - I kid not. Towards the end, the DVD jammed terminally, but I didn't mind. By then only the inertia of overfamiliarity was keeping me going. Sad, really.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Awesome.,"There is one problem with this movie and that's the storyline. It is too convenient and far-fetched. Characters are a little too stupid for the sake of the plot, especially the main character. There is a scene where the main character gets attacked by an airplane, which make it look very cool, like a James Bond film, but the occasion does not call for such an attack at all, except for the purpose of showing off a cool scene.Some movies like L. A. Confidential have several layers of subtle narrative that may end up losing the viewer, while this film goes the opposite direction, as far as to make its characters clarify out loud what had just occurred when it is not at all necessary.Having said that, you may not care about the contrivances because the general structure of the film is so nice. It is so well shot and the performances are so great that the issues with the screenplay fade into the background.The tension can be cut with a knife, and once it starts, it continues with barely a break until the end. Even though the movie can be predictable, you cannot wait to see what happens next anyway.This is one of the more original and better looking movies. There are neat little tricks with the camera that keep surprising and this is all done in the 1950s, may I remind you. The vibes of each location are conveyed with excellency, like the vast middle-of-nowhere shot from a height with long perspective lines.Perhaps a minor note, but this film also has quite a few good-looking night scenes for the time. There are no obvious day-for-night techniques used, which always look fake. North by Northwest does this much better, through a variety of other techniques.Perhaps one visual issue is that it tends to use a lot of matte paintings to fill out the background, and unfortunately, they are quite noticeable.A brief word on the music: it goes a long way to help the movie feel tense. You hear those careful brass tunes pulsating and keeping up the pressure.This film has good actors all round, especially the villains, who aren't full of anger or fake laughter, but are polite, intelligent and sharp looking. Especially the young Martin Landau has a brilliant expression on his face, which can turn very devious while hardly changing at all.North by Northwest is, despite its plot issues, is a captivating movie. This is the sort of film that makes a person want to find and watch every Hitchcock movie there is out there.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
classic & typical hitchcock,"This was one of Hitchcock's best. It was also one of his typical films-a am is framed for a crime (read:murder) and trapped by the circumstantial and other evidence. There were several classic scenes in this movie, like the chase scene on Mount Rushmore, the diner scene (watch for the little kid to plug his ears BEFORE Eva Marie Saint reaches into her purse pulls out her gun and shoots Cary Grant-classic mistake in a classic scene in a classic film), and the crop duster chase scene. I loved it when they dumped alcohol into him, made him drive, and when he returned they hid and staged everything. Pierce Brosnan referred to this in Remington Steele. Watch for Hitchcock's cameo at the very beginning. This was representative as to how Hitchcock did his films and how good filmmaking should be done, even if the camera-work and other stuff is obviously severely outdated.

"its an action movie, a road picture, a romance with espionage thrown in...this is a movie with universal appeal","Alfred Hitchcock has certainly made scarier movies (Psycho, The Birds), and he's made more suspenseful movies (Notorious, Shadow of a doubt), but I don't think he ever made a movie that was as purely entertaining as North by Northwest. What I mean by universal appeal is this; you could put anyone (who likes movies) of any age and sit them down in front of North by Northwest and they will likely enjoy themselves. This movie has something for everyone, it has excellent pacing and sceneryand of course it has the old master at the helm.North by Northwest certainly doesn't look like it's over 50 years old. That's something that a master like Hitchcock adds to a film; his expert use of lighting, camera positioning and sound give this movie a crispness that defies its age. This adds to that universal appeal I mentioned, alas many movies from the 1950s don't look near as good as North by Northwest. It amazes me how many recent movies have forced me to abort due to inferior camera techniquesexcessive camera movement (this can actually make me dizzy), too many close-ups and weird angles, and poor lighting and editing. Heres the deal; many of todays film directors have NO CLUE how to make a truly watchable and lasting movie...and the bigger problem...most of the dumbed-down audience of today can't tell the difference.Speaking of masters, does any actor today really carry a movie with such grace as Cary Grant? Grant plays Richard Thornhill in this movie, a wall street exec who has been mistaken for someone else by a group of international Art collectors who are also into espionage (what secrets they are transporting is irrelevantwhat Hitchcock called the 'Mcguffin'). Grant moves through the film with his typical easy charm that maybe today's young actors should study, indeed Cary Grant is a natural and this is a perfect role for his style. Thornhill is befriended by the lovely Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint, also well cast) on the 20th century limited, but Kendall may or may not be what she appears to be.The story takes us to Chicago where Thornhill is supposed to meet a man at a dusty crossroads in the middle of corn country as (in case you don't know) one of the most famous scenes in movie history unfolds. Eventually we end up at the Mount Rushmore memorial for one of Hitchcock's patented climaxes in or around some famous, exotic locale.It's a wonderful ride... I think the best test of a classic movie is the test of time. I first saw (and fell in love with) North by Northwest in a hotel room in Utah while on vacation when I was about 15 years old. I've watched it many times since and it always seems fresh. When a master is on the mark it is something to relish a gift from the movie gods.Hitchcock was once asked what he did for a living to which he replied ""producer"", when asked what he produced he answered ""Goosebumps"". Enjoy the ride!update: -3 thumbs-down and no 'likes'?

Masterpiece,"One of Hitchcock's very best and the epitome of Hollywood at its best, perfect casting and acting, excellent photography by Robert Burks, brilliant production design by Robert Boyle, and a magnificent score by Bernard Hermann. As in ""Citizen Kane,"" there are many special effects, but they are not obtrusive and serve to tell, rather than distract from, the story. The scenes with the crop duster and on Mount Rushmore are so brilliantly conceived and executed that they have become iconic. In a revival house showing double features, the other movie could be ""Notorious"" (1946), with Ingrid Bergman as the female lead and Claude Rains as the villain. Here, as then, the suspense is gut wrenching.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's Age And Influence Has Impacted This Film's Strengths,"Hitchcock is highly praised by critics and the general public as one of the most influential directors of his time and they are not wrong. I have not yet seen all of Hitchcock's work but I have seen most of his films that are commonly regarded as ""essential"". North By Northwest is one of those ""essential"" films and it was the one that I felt was the weakest. I am sure that most people will disagree with me but this is how I perceived it after viewing the film three times.North By Northwest is written by Ernest Lehman, who has worked on highly regarded films like The Sound of Music, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and a personal favorite of mine Sabrina. Lehman has written very ambitious films, showing off things that other writers have not yet thought of. North By Northwest is a prime example on how grand his vision was for the action thriller. The film's premise is quite funny and it does get you intrigued. The film starts small, then it gets bigger and bigger as the film progresses. The set pieces in the film are daring and at times ridiculous (though not entirely in a bad way). My main issue with the script is the way the protagonist is written. Roger Thornhill is too self-centred and at times cocky for his own good which many may appealingly engaging, I found it to be difficult for me to show any empathy or sympathy of his unfortunate conditions. Towards the end of the film there is a moment where Thornhill and Eve Kendall discuss about being together and this is the first time where Thornhill showed some sort of emotional vulnerability and had me caring and started to see the side of him that was not shown earlier.Alfred Hitchcock is not shy in pushing the boundaries once in a while, and this one is definitely a huge push. This Hitchcock film has definitely inspired many action/thriller films in the future and still being used as inspiration in modern filmmaking. I do admire the fact that Hitchcock wants us following a man who in most situations is helpless to do anything. North By Northwest is a film that contains the most memorable action sequences, but ironically the main reason that these set pieces lacked the impact for me is the influence it has made on contemporary films. These scenes have time and time again been replicated and taken inspiration from it that when I actually give this a watch, it loses the magic that these scenes can give off. The effects that are used in this film are very ambitious, and because of this ambition it has aged poorly as time passes. Though these is heading towards late Hitchcock, he still has not lost his touch to create mystery and suspense.Robert Burks is a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock starting from Strangers on a Train and ending with Marnie (The only film between that he did not work in was Psycho). The relationship between Hitchcock and Burks are an example where both members are in tune with one another. Burks understands Hitchcock's vision, this is why the films they work together are very different from one another and each one has their own style. North By Northwest may be the biggest film that they both have worked on, second being To Catch A Thief. Burks has chosen very wide and huge shots of the environment that the action is taking place, which is one of the key factors that makes this film feel large and ambitious. The crop duster scene or the climax are the key moments where his photography shines. Personally, I much prefer Burks' work on Rear Window and Vertigo but North By Northwest is a force of its own that it cannot be dismissed.Bernard Herrmann is a legendary composer who has worked on the most iconic of films delivering the most iconic of scores. North By Northwest's score is an example of that brilliant craft with an upbeat and tense composition that sticks with you throughout the movie. The score often builds up throughout and then the action and suspense occurs then it comes in full force. It adds on to the sense of desperation to survive which is something Roger Thornhill constantly has to go through.Cary Grant is the protagonist of this film and I'm just going to say that currently I am not a fan of him. I am not sure whether it's the roles he picks, or that I just haven't seen enough of his films. Grant comes off here as a hero or invincible even though he is meant to play a man who is very vulnerable and lacks the skills to survive in the face of danger. Grant constantly has an answer for everything and has a sarcastic joke to say with every response, but this may be more due to the writing than his acting abilities. Eva Marie Saint is another member Hitchcock's list of leading ladies but if I had to rank them, she isn't up there with Grace Kelly and Janet Leigh. Saint still does her role well though, able to project that sexuality that many actresses cannot do and still maintains to be just as equally witty and as Grant. James Mason was a treat to see, he brings this class in his role as the antagonist of the film. The accent and delivery of his lines make gives him a unique quality that other actors of it's time just lack.North By Northwest will stand the test of time as a classic but in a personal level it just didn't impact me the same way as Rear Window or Psycho had on me. I came into this film open minded with every time I watch it and it does get better with each viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Way to go,"When is a spy a spy? And is the audience going to be able to tell if he is or isn't before it is revealed? And when will it be revealed? All those things make room for suspense, edge of your seat stuff. Cary Grant plays it as suave as one can play it - and the dry humor is just spot on (call the police anyone?). So the backdrops are obvious as with most of his movies, but that shouldn't bother you at all. We are talking about other things that will and should interest you way more than that little ""flaw"".The movie may feel a tad bit too long for some, but there is always something going on. And the way he edited some scenes is holding up quite nicely - something that not all movies that have action or stunt scenes can attest from that time period. And then there is that plane scene ... it is a bit of plot hole how we get there (or rather a character inconsistency, maybe even aplliable to at least 2 characters considering what they themselves are saying or doing) ... but normally you will not mind or care.

"Not My Favorite Hitchcock, But A Classic For a Reason","A Madison Avenue advertising executive, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is mistaken for a Mr. George Kaplan and kidnapped by thugs Valerian (Adam Williams) and Licht (Robert Ellenstein).

When Thornhill repeatedly denies he is Kaplan and says he cannot cooperate, Vandamm orders his right-hand man Leonard (Martin Landau) to get rid of him.This is a classic tale of mistaken identity -- perhaps the classic tale. And it has a few twists in store, so if that mix-up wasn't enough to keep the mystery going, there's a few more surprises in store.Eva Marie Saint appears as Thornhill's partner in fake crime, in a much more outgoing role than her reserved ""On the Waterfront"" persona.

on a sweltering hot night he still had his suit, shirt unruffled and tie in tact after what surely would have been a pretty long walk ?

"Good, but overrated","NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a wonderful film. It's not as good as REAR WINDOW or PSYCHO, but it's still very well made. The directing is top notch. Hitchcock builds up tension like no other director can, except maybe for John Carpenter with some of his earliest work like HALLOWEEN. Almost as impressive as the directing in NORTH BY NORTHWEST is the editing. The film is cut almost perfectly. Editing in thrillers is key. Without proper editing, a movie is no good. Editing can make or break a film. Editing is what keeps it alive. The editing here never appears choppy. It's always clear. While the editing and directing is certainly admirable, I still feel that NORTH BY NORTHWEST is overrated. It's not Hitchcock's best. That would be PSYCHO. The problem with this one is that it has not aged as well as Hitchcock's other masterpieces. In fact, this is the one that has been hurt the most by age. It seems a bit dated and is not as suspenseful as it once was. For that, I can only give it 8/10. It's still good, just not great enough to be on the top 250 here on IMDb.",,Anonymous,Mystery

""North by Northwest"" is also the summation of a favorite, most-used Hitchcock plot: an ordinary man is mistakenly identified, falsely accused, and pursued by mysterious forces. The famous ""crop-dusting sequence"" is the peak of this story-theme, with wronged man Cary Grant (as Roger O Thornhill) helplessly attacked by an airplane in broad daylight as he waits at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere to meet a man who doesn't exist.The only logical way to follow-up this line of suspense was with ""The Birds""; therein, the attacker becomes the inhuman, thus more horrific, species of flying fowl. We innately know that, if birds were as big as crop-dusting airplanes, they would eat us. So, Mr. Grant is perhaps safer with a single plane than he would be against a flock of seagulls. The missing link in Hitchcock's chronological quartet is ""Psycho"", which followed ""North by Northwest"", and climaxes the director's psychologically-based terror themes. And, at long last, sex is used like a fly-swatter.The marvelously funny script, by Ernest Lehman, received most of the attention, when it was time to give out 1959 movie awards. Hitchcock's direction, Bernard Herrmann's musical score and George Tomasini's editing couldn't be beat - but, they were. A trio of supporting players might have be noticed: Eva Marie Saint (as Eve Kendall), Martin Landau (as Leonard), and James Mason (as Phillip Vandamm) seethe with forbidden sex. Listen up for Mr. Landau's scene-stealing ""Call it my woman's intuition"" line; and, watch for Ms. Saint to seductively mouth ""I never make love on an empty stomach.""

"""What does the 'O' stand for?"" ""Nothing.""","By 1959, Alfred Hitchcock's star as a director had been monumentally starting to rise, propelling him past the point of respectable craftsman or even serious artist, to the point of recognition as an industry celebrity. However, contrary to the stereotype of the artist resisting the trappings of celebrity, this star image was one Hitchcock voluntarily, even consciously bought into, playing up his larger than life image of the 'master of suspense', particularly in his show, ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", complete with his own recognizable theme song. As such, it would appear that the collection of tropes, whether thematic trends, technical similarities or recurring narrative and character types now characterized as a ""Hitchcock film"" were hardly accidental, a theory for which North by Northwest proves a perfect example. Largely recognized as one of Hitchcock's most fun and least serious outings, North by Northwest can be retrospectively seen as an attempt by Hitchcock to make, in many ways, the definitive ""Alfred Hitchcock"" film, intentionally encapsulating and often playing up many of the defining elements of his past films into a single, hugely enjoyable narrative.Much of what makes the film so downright fun is its synthesis between the straightforward and the cheekily tongue-in-cheek. While, if functioning as a standalone narrative, the film could easily accomplish its task of delivering a breathless, enthralling spy thriller and mystery, the real fun is to be found in recognizing how consciously and unashamedly cinematic the whole ordeal is. The plot appears tailored to intentionally deliver the maximum quantity of thrills, laughs, edginess (notice the sensors being tested in the uncommonly explicit exchange of sexual dialogue between Grant and Marie Saint on the train) suspense and memorable set pieces (especially one involving a crop duster which viewers just may have heard of), demonstrating Hitchcock's effortless command of the cinematic form and potential to warp it towards any given motivation. As such, the entire film effectively functions as its own ""MacGuffin"", in the end, signifying, like the 'O' in Thornhill's name, ""nothing"" - a film existing just for the sake of being a film, for showing how masterfully crafted, carefully constructed and downright entertaining cinema can be. Even the film's title was allegedly chosen as a place holder, simply because it sounded catchy, and finally kept since no one could think of a better one, with no deeper significance.This is not to say that no narrative or thematic complexity can be read within the film, but rather than it intertwines itself with this notion of willfully cultivated escapism. The most pervasive theme is the self-reflexive notion of construction - just as the plot is consciously constructed with the intent of epitomizing the heroic and spy myths, as well as Hitchcock's ever familiar 'wrong man' theme (his inclusion of Thornhill's mother, who fulfils virtually no function within the plot can also be seen as a dig at his own recurring domineering mother figures within his body of work), his film continually engages with notions of characters constructing identities and, in turn, having new identities forged for them. As Grant's Thornhill remarks, he is continually being thrust into a series of performances or roles, some deliberate, most enforced unwillingly upon him, and is only ever taken seriously by other characters in the narrative when he buys into playing up such imposed performances. However, it is also intriguing to note the series of facades and constructed identities other characters within the film assume, with many far less apparent than it would initially seem, demonstrating webs of construction within construction which ultimately add far more nuance and poignant thematic issues to the film than it is commonly given credit for.However, the film also unquestionably functions as an independent narrative, and a stunningly constructed one, both technically and emotionally. While setpieces such as the crop duster sequence and the finale on Mount Rushmore may be the ones to (justifiably) work their way into the collective unconscious, it would take close attention paid to the smaller, less obtrusive moments in the film (Thornhill's subtle manipulation of his being continually thrust into the spotlight to save himself, the effortless, rapid fire and often hilariously self-aware nature of the vibrant script) which truly demonstrate Hitchcock's impeccable command of cinematography, editing, pacing and sound (notice the pitch- perfect alternating use of utter silence or Bernard Herrmann's timeless, triumphant musical score). Willfully superficial or not, the film truly demonstrates the power of the cinematic form to arouse sensation and genuine emotional response in the viewer, delivering a peerlessly enjoyable hybrid of thrills and humour.Of course, as Hitchcock realized, none but Cary Grant (the master of his own constructed star persona) could have properly essayed the role of Roger 'O' Thornhill, as Grant's unquenchable charisma, astute comic timing and genuine presence keep the viewer firmly rooting for Thornhill through adversity after adversity, making each normally unbelievable character trait or ambitious line of dialogue somehow ring with endearing, charming credibility. Eva Marie Saint makes for the definitively ambiguous femme fatale figure, excelling both at devious betrayal and genuine, raw emotion, making the chemistry between the two stars exquisitely believable and crackling with truly dynamic energy. The similarly self-reflexive casting of James Mason as the antagonist (characters in Hitchcock's earlier Rope had discussed how Mason would make an excellent villain) proves entirely justified, as his sneering, oily, perpetually composed Philip Vandamm makes for a deliciously deplorable yet oddly charming foe to boo and hiss at. Finally, character actor Martin Landau deserves considerable plaudits for redeeming the role of the evil henchmen to a genuinely intriguing, confusing and viscerally frightening figure, and Jessie Royce Landis is a welcomely comical presence as Thornhill's scathing, society woman mother.Whether taken as self-reflexive, satirical dig at his own stereotypes or an impeccably thrilling romp on its own right, Hitchcock's North by Northwest unquestionably holds up as a timeless classic of cinema, and essential viewing for all who have yet to experience it.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"I'm Not a Hitchcock Fan, but this I like","After years of recommendation, I finally watched NXNW.  Over the years I have seen four other Hitchcock films-- ""Psycho"" (it felt 30 minutes too long), ""Rear Window"" (it felt at LEAST 30 minutes too long), ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (loved it), and ""Vertigo"" (2 hours, felt like it was six).  After a track record like that, I began to think that either a) Years of watching films from the 1980's and -90's has ruined me, or b) Hitchcock isn't nearly as brilliant as some people seem to think he is.  Turns out-- big surprise-- it's a mixture of both.""Vertigo"" was very stylish (in parts), but I don't think it holds up, as the story is told much too slowly to make me care.  With ""North by Northwest"" I was pulled in right from the very beginning-- the writing was wonderful. Plot structure and many of the one-liners were too much fun to watch and hear, and with the exception of some cleverly-used 1959 special effects, this screenplay could be remade today, as written, if only because Cary Grant can't open a film anymore (although with a script this great, it wouldn't really matter who the lead was).Whereas I marveled at screenwriter Lehman's work every few minutes, and Hitchcock's work only every 30 minutes or so, this is still an extremely watchable film and I loved every second of it.  It's almost enough to finally make me a Hitchcock fan... but I think I'll check out some Lehman films first.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"a big collection of classic Hitchcock sequences, strung together by red herrings, plus Cary Grant","Although I wouldn't rank North by Northwest in the highest pantheon of Hitchcock's masterpieces- it won't ever get as deep or revelatory or demanding of repeat viewings as Psycho or Vertigo or Rope- it's got enough crackling, dry-sharp wit and incorrigible suspense sequences for an excellent time. One can tell that Hitchcock might be reaching at times to get commercial appeal, even more than usual with his films of the 50s (and after Vertigo and before Psycho, he's trying to make up for what he thought of as lost ground at the box office frankly). But it's all the same a ballsy commercial entertainment that still hails high above the ranks of today's proficient but soulless demonstrations of panache with archetypal heroes and villains in double-cross moves.Thornhill (Cary Grant) is an advertising man who gets the typical-Hitchcock 'wrong-man' scenario, and as typical too involving a) spies, b) government espionage with the all-popular 'MacGuffin', and c) a blonde leading lady with her own issues to deal with in the middle of the men. The villains in this case are the very calm and collected James Mason and his leering henchman Martin Landau, as a quasi-chase develops across the country all over George Kaplan- who, by the way, doesn't really exist.The plot, to be sure, is cobbled together under Ernest Lehman's attempts to put together something that Hitchcock would respond to and, more crucially, afford him his two favorite pastimes: first is the witty, very knowing, practically self-conscious dialog meant exclusively to lighten potentially clichéd territory and give grins to others; the scenes with Grant and Saint in the train car, trading off innuendo, is one scene that over-steps the problematic territory, in general their chemistry is elevated thanks to Lehamn's snappy, amusing words. There's even a great bit provided by Thornhill's mother, played by Jessie Royce Landis, as one of Hitchcock's older who smirk things like ""You gentlemen aren't REALLY trying to kill my son, are you?""The other pastime are absurd but completely wonderful sequences where a character or characters get pitted against larger-than-life odds. The hallmark crop-duster scene was the one I had seen even before the whole film, in a class where the sequence was broken down; this, along with Psycho's shower scene, make up some of the most accomplished executions of storyboarding, and how timing and details of the figures in a shot, and the intensity or lack thereof, that Hitchcock's ever done. The Mount Rushmore climax- save for what happens to Grant and Saint following the cliffhanger moment, which is my least favorite part of the movie- is also stellar, including what precedes it in the hideout.North by Northwest is essential viewing, but is it really a completely devastating triumph like Hitchcock at the peak of his powers? Not exactly, as there's some moments where it feels like Hitchcock on auto-pilot with some of the twists and preposterous turns, and he's really more into his suspense scenes and getting Grant perfect in these scenes more than anything else. There's also not much depth to the whole process, yet that's part of its appeal as a yarn of an adventure story. But as a suspense-comedy, it's a work of big-studio success, as Grant comes off on note in every scene he's in, and helps make even the smaller, supporting actors seem important in the grand scheme of the story. In a way it's a great Hitchcock film in the sense that you can just curb the usual logic at the door and just hop along for the ride, and it's in this that North by Northwest should always be remembered (alongside the Bernard Herrmann score, one of his best).",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Okay mistaken identity thriller by Alfred Hitchcock...,"1st watched 3/12/2017:
Okay mistaken identity thriller by Alfred Hitchcock. I expected more from this much-heralded money maker from the great director. I felt like he almost relied too much on the like-ability of the star Cary Grant to try and pull this one off instead of his film-making. The movie was interesting early with Grant given a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor, as an advertising agent who is mistaken for someone else, and kidnapped. The early twists kept my interest, but when the focus became the possible romance between him and the Eva Marie Saint character - a little around half way thru - it became dull. I do admit that they have one of the hottest pre-code exchanges I have seen on film, and the interesting use of the United Nations and Mount Rushmore is definitely different, but this doesn't make a whole movie. What makes a thriller are twists and turns not romantic interests. It's ok to have this as long as it doesn't simplify the story - ultimately this movie does this. Do we really care whether the stars get together in the end ? Not I - I know it's going to happen - what matters is what happens between. James Mason is the ""so-called"" mean guy in the story, but in my opinion - he is a little too refined in the part. I'm glad I saw the movie, but nothing really made me want to see it again.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A merry chase,"From the first fandago music with its interesting opening credits design, we are off on a merry chase, a dance of intrigue and fun with the master -- who gets his cameo over with almost immediately in the first moments of the film.Every mis-lead is calculated. Every moment is mis-direction. And then, when Hitchcock allows, we learn the truth. The chase scene on Mount Rushmore is a classic -- and doesn't even involve cars.

This movie represents the glory days of Hollywood for me - each time I watch it, I wish that Hollywood made more movies like it today.  Right from the opening credits Bernard Herrmann's thundering score greets you, and you know you're in for a wild ride.  Cary Grant basically defines the term ""movie star"" in the best performance of his career.

Keep Calm and Cary On.,"""North by Northwest"" is, put simply, wonderful. One of Cinema's timeless classics.Via an unfortunate misunderstanding, advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is believed to be a US spy named George Kaplan. Dragged into international espionage, pursued by the men of Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) and later the police, following a murder at the UN, Thornhill boards a train and meets Eve Kendall (Eve Marie Saint) who agree to help him. Chased across the country, Thornhill gets the chance to turn the tables when he discovers that Eve is not who she seems.Timeless really is the word for ""North by Northwest"". Of course the fashion and technology has changed, as has mid-afternoon drinking culture, but the witty, funny dialogue and the iconic action moments will never go out of style. Neither will Saul Bass' oft imitated opening title sequence, nor the sly wit of Hitchcock's direction.I accept the criticism that it's not, perhaps, the most realistic film ever made, or that it's Hitchcock returning to a relatively similar themes to ""The Lady Vanishes"" but it's Cary Grant cracking wise in a tailored suit, it's a cropdusting plane circling in the distance, it's James Mason saying anything in that unique accent, it's considering how much Mason's house would be worth if it were real, it's picking up on the daring subtext that Landau added to his performance, it's sliding down the edge of Mount Rushmore, it's a shot of a train entering a tunnel.It's not even Hitchcock's best film, but still it's an undeniable masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great from Frame #1,"I pulled this one out last night and popped it in the machine. In five minutes, my 4 kids, aged 13 to 8, were watching it with me. The Bernard Herrmann score pulls you in right away with the opening credits, then Cary Grant and Hitchcock, along with a fantastic supporting cast, propel you from scene to scene...the film just flies. When the ""love theme"" begins while Grant and Eve Marie Saint are traveling on the train, I couldn't believe how moving the scene was, and the actors were completely clothed, and either standing or seated. Amazing. As for the story in general, the screenplay is nothing less than superb. I can pick this film up anywhere in the story and it still captivates me. The tension is finely tuned, and the sets are perfect.  To ""tedg"", who has a problem with this movie, I say: you take yourself too seriously. Hitchcock, Grant, James Mason and many of the cast are dead now, but this fine film lives on and on, and for many very good reasons: directing, script, score, acting, acting, acting, sets and great chemistry all around.

One that doesn't quite age well,"By general consensus Hitchcock reached the height of his powers from ""Strangers on a Train""(1951) to ""Marnie""(1964). Admittedly there were some splendid things before, ""The 39 Steps"", ""Rebecca"" and ""Shadow of a Doubt"" among them, and not everything in the great period was among his finest. What to make of ""The Trouble with Harry"" for instance! I have to admit that I don't share the universal admiration for ""Rear Window"" which I find somewhat contrived - a sort of textbook exercise in exploring from a limited viewpoint, which I know to be its purpose but which I find just a little bit dull. As this could well be one of my cinematic blindspots I am willing to respect the views of its admirers. I am also rather lukewarm about ""North by Northwest"" for reasons that I feel to be somewhat more valid. On first showing I found this to be a quite super thriller, witty, accomplished and stylish with some quite dazzling set pieces, not least the famous crop dusting sequence. But with each subsequent viewing my admiration has worn thinner. Again I feel it to be something of an exercise, an attempt to build a thriller out of all the successful ingredients of Hitchcock's earlier works. Thus, cliffhangers (""Saboteur"", ""To Catch a Thief"" and ""Vertigo""), cars driven at speed by drunken drivers (""Notorious""), talking oneself out of dangerous situations when trapped in public gatherings (""The 39 Steps"" and ""Saboteur"").....I could go on.....Only the agoraphobic scene of the crop dusting, the best scene in the film, breaks new ground. The rest is a rehash of things gone before, albeit quite entertaining until the longueurs of the penultimate scene at the spy's house by Mount Rushmore and the technically rather dubiously constructed sequence on the mount itself which never quite conveys the vertigo it should. This is Hitch's longest feature and after the two-hour point it rather feels it. I suppose that for me it boils down to the fact that he made very much the same film in 1935 - ""The 39 Steps""- lasting little more than half the time, so much better for its tremendous sense of pace and urgency. In 1956 he remade the 1934 ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" taking nearly twice the time to tell the story. However on this occasion, he invested it with far greater depth of detail creating an infinitely more satisfying cinematic experience. Thus was Hitchcock forever unpredictable.",,Anonymous,Mystery
