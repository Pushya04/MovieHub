Not as Bad as People Think,"Fantastic Four (2005) is a charming movie that has a lot of that early 2000's flair to it, and unlike its 2015 counterpart, the characters actually seemed real and you could believe that giant rock man was walking around. As for plot, it could be a little bit more straightfoward, but it doesn't throw me off. It's more of just an annoyance, and I'd say that all of the characters costume design looks a lot better than 2015 Fantastic Four as well. Also, Doctor Doom is more fitting to the comic book representation. Overall, it was a pretty good movie. Don't see why people have such a problem with it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A pretty good film,"As a reader of the comics, I was really excited to finally see a movie about my favourite characters. I've learned that a FF film was in ""development hell"" for some decades, so when it finally came out, obviously I rushed to the theater. And, I was not disappointed at all. Of course it's not as good as X-Men 2 or Spider-Man (the original, with Tobey Maguire), but it's good for what it aims to be: a sci-fi/action movie about comic book characters. You have to understand that the Fantastic Four are not as popular as other heroes, like Iron Man i.e., besides, their stories always covered the most strange, bizarre, far out things imaginable. And, because they are a family, there are many corny moments in the movie, but the comics too have those moments, then you just have to ""let it go"", to really enjoy the story. Overall, it's a very decent movie about very decent people. Relax, and enjoy the ride!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Captures a time when superhero films were more joyful,"Fantastic Four is one of the last superhero films, that I can recall, that wasn't insufferably bleak or incredibly serious to a point where any shred of humor was seen as obtuse to the film's narrative. Yes, Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is an indisputable breakthrough in superhero films, but it also made the seriousness of superhero films standard, something that would follow into the late 2000's and early 2010's as Marvel built up The Avengers. Fantastic Four reminds of the quirkiness superhero films were once predicated upon, and while it may get a bit too corny at times, and its focus can never really settle, it's also a very commercial film that satisfies on some level of entertainment when it gives every card in its deck a fair time to shine.We open by looking at a physicist named Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), who is convinced evolution was triggered millions of years ago by stray elements of cosmic energy in space, some of which will pass near Earth very soon. His pal, astronaut Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), works by his side on this potentially revolutionary discovery by helping him convince their old classmate Dr. Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), the CEO of Von Doom Industries, to allow both of them access to his private space station to further experiment with the effects of these cosmic energy particles. While Doom agrees, he winds up walking away with most of the profits that this experiment will bring, affirming Reed's desperation to make his project work.Still, he persists on and brings his close friends Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) and her brother Johnny (Chris Evans) along for the ride. However, when a trip to outer space goes awry, exposure with the cosmic energy results in the four receiving deformities and enhanced human abilities that have never before been seen: Reed possesses the ability to stretch every limb of his body, Susan has the ability to disappear and reappear at her leisure, Johnny can have his body engulfed in flame simply by reciting the phrase ""Flame on!,"" and Ben turns into a hideous, orange rock monster.Following the four's mutations, writers Michael France and Mark Frost focus a great deal of their time on the agony that these mutations bring, particularly The Thing, who experiences his wife leaving him shortly after revealing his deformity. While this agony is a solid angle (one I'd argue necessary in most superhero films), too much of the time is spent profiling The Thing and not enough on the remaining characters of the film. Reed and Ben, who are ultimately the film's main focus, wind up monopolizing too much of the picture, and any time we see Johnny is when he's right in the middle of making a smug comment or being his typical, womanizing self.The action in Fantastic Four has a colorful commercial look to it, brilliantly bold and very vibrant in a way that makes many of the scenes pop with life. It manages to achieve a comic book aesthetic without resorting to picture-in-picture editing. One particularly involving scene takes place on a suspension bridge, where The Thing is seen pummeling everything in his sight and the remaining three members of the team must resort to either relaxing him or protecting drivers and innocent bystanders.The goofiness in Fantastic Four, however, in an age of dark superhero films that come with slick aesthetics and brooding characters, is a delightful change of pace. Yes, there is a point when one wishes director Tim Story, France, and Frost would command a tighter grip on the seriousness of the writing, but the pulpy fun of Fantastic Four, in addition to the effects and the neatly choreographed action, keep it a moving, satisfying spectacle that is more than just colors flying around on screen, trying to find their place.Starring: Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, and Julian McMahon. Directed by: Tim Story.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Rewatch after 17 years, and not bad at all","Watched again and it is awesome that the technique 17 years ago was not that bad. A marvel movie before marvel , and with Alba and young captain! The last fight with big boss was okay , and cannot ask for more.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So-So Superhero Film,"During a failed experiment in space, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue and Johnny Storm (Jessica Alba and Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) and Dr. Victor Von Doom are bombarded by cosmic rays, changing their molecular systems and giving them superpowers. Four of them become the superhero team, the Fantastic Four, while Doom becomes their new enemy.The Fantastic Four is far from fantastic but it does make for decent entertainment. The movie is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all. This is good news and bad news. The good part is that the film doesn't take itself so seriously and the movie ends up being mildly enjoyable. On the other hand, it becomes silly and cheesy with laughable acting and events. Also, the movie is actually kind of dull. There are some fun spots (like the bridge scene) but there is really no spark to the film. The blame should go to Tim Story and his lack of imagination. He keeps the film bland and dull but he shouldn't get all the blame. He is working with a cheesy and weak script courtesy of Michael France and Mark Frost. If the writing had been a little better and the direction a little sharper then the film could have been better but it stands as a mediocre one.The acting is a mix bag with some good performances and a couple of bad ones. Chris Evans gives the best performance as Johnny Storm. He seems to be having a blast and his performance is contagious. It's also nice to see something different. Usually in super hero movies, the superheroes are moody and they just want a normal life, which isn't a bad thing. However Johnny Storm actually wants to show off and he considers his new powers to be a blessing and not a curse. On the opposite side of Johnny Storm, you have Ben Grimm played by Michael Chiklis. He is the exact opposite and he wants to give rid of his powers. His situation is pretty sad since his fiancé leaves him and it's hard for him to really live a normal life. Chiklis gives a good performance and it was a little heartwarming. Jessica Alba gives a bad performance as Sue Storm. She is unconvincing as a scientist and her emotions feel fake. Ioan Gruffudd is actually somehow worse and he can't really act. His chemistry with Jessica Alba is almost non existent. The only other person worth mentioning is Julian McMahon and he plays Dr. Victor Von Doom. I think he makes a good bad guy and he gives a decent performance.Despite the lack of quality in the film, Fantastic Four is pretty harmless. There is nothing here that should really offend anyone and it works better with kids than with adults or teenagers. The film has some things going for it though. The special effects are at least above average and the movie provides decent eye candy. As previously noted, there are some performances that stood out so the whole experience isn't a complete waste of time. However, The Fantastic Four is still a disappointment. In the end, the movie is worth a rental at the most, in my opinion. Rating 5/10",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So underrated,Why people hate this movie this movie is so underrated,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The title is half right,"In that there are Four of them. But Fantastic? More like ""Mediocre"", or ""Barely Adequate"", or ""Contractually Sufficient"".For once, the reviewers were right. This film is a big, rambling, poorly conceived, sloppily scripted, shoddily acted pile of orange rubble. Avoid it, or suffer the consequences.It's hard to know where to begin, there's so much wrong with it. For a start, the acting ""talent"" is AWOL. TV performers don't inevitably get lost on the big screen, but this cadre evited it. Alba turns in the exact same performance that she always does, going through her entire range, from ""pouty and petulant"" to ""petulant and pouty"". Evans is either a strutting superannuated fratboy poseur, or for some reason is deliberately playing one so well that it's hard to tell the difference - either way, his character is thoroughly irritating and utterly unsympathetic. Chiklis is adequate, but is let down by the plain fact that he's a round little man in a big rubber muscle suit. This was a role for Ron Perlman, not Wimpy. Gruffudd is a huge disappointment; he has no screen presence, and his slightly out-of-his-depth portrayal of Hornblower is apparently the man, not the character. It would have been better if he had been invisible, as he manages to fade into the background with ease in every scene. McMahon is the only actor who appears to be enjoying himself, but as he's barely in the film, he can't rescue it.The script was apparently in development for ten years. I can't see why, as it's one scene, repeated ten times. If this is the refined version, I shudder to imagine what the raw cut would have been like. I find it hard to believe that the lines were written by, or for, adults. There's no real plot to the film, or even a story beyond ""Nasty self absorbed un-credible astronauts become nasty self absorbed un-credible 'super' heroes, then argue with each other for a while, take their clothes off for no reason, then beat up some poor disfigured guy apparently because he didn't join their little gang, roll credits."" Direction and cinematography was Filmschool #101, the score was instantly forgettable, and the editing was appalling, with the pacing in particular being random and rushed.The effects were only what we've come to expect from a hundred million dollar movie, which brings me to the big question: what on earth did they spend all that money on? It wasn't on the ""talent"", either on-screen or off, it certainly wasn't on the rubber suit, and the effects couldn't have cost that much - or if they did, they were seriously over-charged.I have an idea where at least some of the budget went. From IMDb's Trivia section: ""Contains over 25 cameos from real life employees of Fox television affiliates."" And I strongly suspect that the IMDb records for this movie contain about 2,5000 comments and ratings and mutual approvals from about five of those real life employees. Reading the top recommended comments, most of which have 10 ratings, reveals a depressing pattern of almost identically styled raves from the likes of ""top10dude"" and ""BigTenPower"" with embarrassingly obvious track records of enthusing about, you guessed it, other shoddy Fox movies. When someone rates Elektra a 10, you have to just snort in disbelief at the audacity of it.I guess it's a pretty good investment for Fox, but this kind of astroturfing drastically reduces the usefulness of IMDb as an early review source. With time, this awful, foul mess of a movie will no doubt settle to its rightful place near the bottom of the ratings pile, but it's likely that the shill reviews will stay stubbornly at the top of the recommended pile for a long time to come. Beware; consider the source.[2013 update] To this day, the top 'recommended' comment is an early 10 rating from a member who signed up to IMDb just to rave about this one film using the minimum allowed size of review, and then never contributed again. What dedication!",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Better Than Daredevil, Not As Good As Either Of The X-Men.","The Fantastic Four was a pretty good superhero movie but it lacked something. I do not think it truly lived up to it's endless hype from early this year. Aside from a few scenes that stick out, most are in the trailer, there is not much there other than some slick special effects sprinkled about. It is understandable, however, due to the fact that this film is about the origin of 5 different individuals and how they gained their super powers. I imagine the next one (of course, if there is a next one) will be more action packed.As for a quick rundown of the story, 5 people are sent into a space ship to gather information that would be helpful in curing diseases and other good stuff. The crew consists of Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Reed Richards, (Ioan Gruffudd), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) & Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). While in the space station, the super cosmic storm hits hours earlier than expected and all 5 are caught in the storm, forever altering their DNA (or something like that). The one that got it the worst was Grimm.The standouts from this movie are The Thing/Ben Grimm, Johnny Storm/Human Torch & Sue Storm/Invisible Girl. The Thing & Torch stand out because of both their characters and personalities & Jessica Alba stands out pretty much just because she is Jessica Alba.I feel that Reed Richards was more of an annoyance in the movie and not as likable a character as, say, the Human Torch. Also, I fear that Dr. Doom will probably forever be compared to the Green Goblin from Spider-Man, due to the hokey masks and all. Also, the voice for Doom did not quite fit for me. I am not sure if his voice is supposed to be that docile or not, but I always pictured a deeper, more menacing voice for him.I do hope this movie is not as criticized as movies such as Hulk or Daredevil. This movie was not that bad, probably not even as bad as I have made it seem. I would rate it somewhere in between X-Men and Daredevil. 7.5/10",,Anonymous,Fantasy
I Don't Get the Hate for this Movie,"I recently watched the 2005 version of ""The Fantastic Four"" in preparation for the reboot that is in theaters now. This movie and its sequel, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" are 20th Century Fox productions. The Fantastic Four and X-Men franchises were both leased out to Fox prior to Marvel getting its own film production studios, and like other Marvel properties from before the MCU, this film is often bashed by comic book fans.I personally don't see what's not to like here. Indeed, I think that this film does a great job portraying the FF's origin story. Sure, The Thing looks a bit hokey in what is clearly a rubberized suit of some sort, and I think they surely could have found an actor that looked more like Reed Richards from the comics than Ioan Gruffudd (that's quite the name, by the way!). But all in all, this is a.....fantastic....film. lolI give it 8/10 stars. Jessica Alba does great as Sue Storm, and Julian McMahon is a superb Dr. Doom. The plot and the acting are well done, and the pace of the storytelling is good as well. To me, there's much more to like in this movie than to dislike.Language note, though: There is one ""GD"" in this movie, which I wasn't expecting (it's when Ben Grimm is in the hospital bed after returning from space). I guess it just goes to show that Marvel movies were not always kid-friendly even before the recent trend in the MCU line. So heads up for that.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Average superhero film, and that's not a bad thing","It's a nice movie I suppose. Seen through a younger viewers eyes this movie appears to be more awesome,and has good special effects for its time. Seen through an adults eyes this movie was just average, Jessica Alba however was not average, seeing her in tights makes this movie very watchable.... I do think movies like this are fine, not all superhero films have to be overly serious,well acted and violent. The audience for movies like Fantastic 4 are out there.The characters personalities stay true to the comic book and thats very important.I've seen this movie 3 times and I'm not a fan of seeing movies more than once usually.Fun silly movies will do this to me.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Flaw:  Sucks pooh through a straw.,"This movie is just so BORING! The actors are cheesecake and the whole thing is so predictable. The special effects aren't so special, nothing of interest happens for the first hour and a half. It reminded me of the old joke:""Man goes into the butchers and asks for a pound of bacon, the butcher asks 'Lean back?' so the man leans back and asks for a pound of bacon.""Not funny, not clever and wholly predictable Batman. The experience of watching this movie reminded me of watching the Hulk and I only ever wanted to do that once in my lifetime.If you have nothing better to do than watch this movie then do nothing.When is Hollywood going to stop force feeding us these toothpaste advertising ""actors""?

I really enjoyed it,"Another unjustly bashed movie. Of course it is not masterpiece of cinematography, but it doesn't try to be. Solid adaptation of comic-book in manner typical for Marvel - expensive, huge, light and very entertaining. Plus, it has Jessica Alba in tight costume. She even gets completely naked several times, but unfortunately she plays role of Invisible Girl, so not much use of it.7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
2 reasons why this ain't so bad!,"And no I'm not talking about Jessica Alba here (I wonder why someone would think that? ;o) ... but seriously though, the two reasons why this movie worked for me and wasn't as bad as the critics made it sound are:Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans! Their ""relationship"" is the core or anchor of the movie. Before I go on, I also have to admit, that I don't know the FF comics that well, so any inaccuracy that might be in the movie, I can't point them out to you. One thing is for sure, if someone goes invisible, without clothes, that means you can't see them! (wouldn't have been PG-13 then also, right?) ;o)So while the movie has it's flaws (storyline/some action/characters/and so forth), it is still a nice/good enough movie to watch and it all comes down to two people! (there's also an unrated longer version out now on DVD, but I haven't seen that yet)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Solid effort,"What we really have here is a solidly put together superhero movie of the popcorn variety which will more than likely get the sequel it deserves, which unfortunately suffers from timing issues, having come out a whole three weeks after a movie named Batman Begins, which seems to be considered as one of if not the best superhero movie ever made. Since this is a different movie you can't really compare the two in my opinion. Performances are fair to excellent but this being the first movie of a possible series the various relationships have to be set up, and characters have to make sense within whatever story is presented. Origins of the heroes and villains need to be explained, which when you have 5 major characters plus the supporting people takes a whole load of time and you don't want your movie running much more than two hours. Writing seemed to make sense for what was there, but I'd be interested to see what happens in the next one now that the major relationships have been established. What was there was well presented it's just too bad that Batman Begins came out first to deservedly steal whatever thunder this was likely to generate. Again a decent way to fill two hours, just don't expect to be blown away.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Probably the Worst Comic Book Movie I've Ever Seen,"Because of the overwhelming barrage of unfavorable reviews, I went into ""Fantastic Four"" with very low expectations.I was still utterly disappointed with what I saw.It is probably the worst movie based on a comic book that I've ever seen (having not yet had the pleasure of sitting through ""Elektra"" or ""Catwoman""). Prior to ""Fantastic Four"" I would've awarded this ""honor"" to ""Daredevil,"" but alas (Yes, I'm sorry to say) ""Fantastic Four"" is even worse.First off, it moves far too quickly. I don't mean that the movie is just a collection of action sequences strung together (although there is little or no plot to connect one scene to the next). In fact, there is very little action in the movie. What I mean is that the pace of the film is too rushed. The line readings, for example, are delivered much too fast. The director should've varied the pace a bit more, particularly in the so-called ""dramatic"" scenes.I don't think the movie was very well cast either. The performances are embarrassingly bad. They go from flat and dull one second to over-the-top and obnoxious the next (the worst offender being the amazingly stiff and lifeless Jessica Alba). The only actor who seems to bring any degree (no matter how small) of subtlety or depth to his character is Michael Chiklis. Perhaps the actors simply did the best they could with what they had to work with, because the characters are uninteresting, unsympathetic and, at times, flat-out annoying (especially Chris Evans' hotshot thrill-seeking ""Human Torch"").The only thing worse than the pace, the characterizations and the performances was the writing. The dialogue is incredibly shallow and obvious. Practically every line is a cliché. Here's a small sample:""You're such a dork, Reed."" ""Which of you is the leader?"" ""Johnny, say you're sorry."" ""You two need a time-out."" ""He started it."" ""You need to control yourself. Think before you act."" ""Nothing personal."" ""Being different isn't always bad."" ""We're all in this together."" ""I can't hold it!"" ""Ya done good, kid.""The special effects aren't really that special. At times they work just fine. At other times they look very cartoonish and unbelievable. The score, by the usually reliable John Ottman, is uninspired and, quite frankly, very corny. The choice of songs for the movie were also pretty bad. The direction is sadly lacking in any artistic vision or style. Having previously done comedies like ""Taxi"" and ""Barbershop,"" Tim Story just doesn't seem to demonstrate the natural grasp for the material that Sam Raimi or Bryan Singer does.Speaking in very broad, generalizing terms, those are just some of the problems I had with the movie. To get more specific, however, I would have to give away a few spoilers. If you haven't yet seen the film, and still plan to, you may want to skip over this next section.*SPOILERS*Despite the fact that throughout the film they continue to search for an explanation, it is never revealed how or why the space storm arrives early.After his transformation, Ben calls his girlfriend from a payphone outside his home. He asks her to come outside, which she does... in her negligee (despite the fact that it's nighttime).When Ben inadvertently causes a pile-up on a bridge, his three friends just happen to arrive on that same bridge at the very moment the accidents begin to occur.On the bridge, Reed Richards tells Sue Storm he and Chris can't get past the police to help Ben, but (because of her invisibility) she can. She immediately turns invisible, removes her undergarments and gets by the police, but then so do Reed and her brother. What was the point then of her turning invisible and stripping (besides the obvious reason of providing the audience with a brief glimpse at Jessica Alba's body)?Ben's girlfriend also goes to the trouble of coming to the bridge and pushing her way through the crowd simply to return a ring to Ben. She takes it off, places it on the street and walks away without saying a word. In the scene that immediately follows, Chris sardonically asks Ben, ""Where are your ears?"" Considering the man just lost his love, he couldn't show just a bit more understanding?The films establishes that Ben weighs close to 700 pounds (he can stall an elevator and leave footprints in the pavement). Yet, in the climatic fight scene, he slides off the hood of a car without even leaving a scratch, let alone a dent.*END OF SPOILERS*Overall, I'd say the movie was very sloppily and carelessly put together. Things are set up but never paid off. Significant questions are posed but never answered. The movie had potential but never even came close to realizing it. My advice to improve ""Fantastic Four"" would've been a complete overhaul of the script (probably by some different writers), a different director and, aside from Michael Chiklis, a different cast.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Horrible,"First let me say that I love the Fantastic Four comic books. I know exactly what works and what doesn't. So I feel well qualified to evaluate this film.Secondly we need to address the issue of: Should a movie be 100% faithful to source material? Well, even if it were possible would you want the movie to be a carbon copy of the source material? Some things don't translate well to the screen. And sometimes (Harry Potter 1 *cough*) trying to be just like the original material is a bad idea! But when a character is fundamentally changed that's usually a bad idea. Fantastic Four takes many liberties with the characters some are worse than others. But a director and writer need to find the right medium that is a balance between the source and making a good movie. In this movie they changed the story around to try to make a better movie and failed! Perhaps they should have hired Goyer (Blade films, Batman Begins) to write the script, somebody who appreciates the original material.Fantastic Four is a film about a group of four people who are changed in a cosmic ""accident"" and form a Super-Hero team. The film tries to make it a movie about coping with change and family strife, which is in theory a good idea but fails here. We are presented with a film that tries many things and all of them feel half-done. The only things that saved the film and made me give it a 7/10 are the Ben Grimm parts of the story. We have somebody who is transformed into a monster and hates it. Also the movie tries to rush into the transformation, which is a good idea, but slows down right afterwards and just meanders forward.Overall: Not horrible. But if the people at FOX are reading this: You had a chance to make a great movie and blew it with a mediocre script, crappy director and over mediocrity!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Absolutely Excellent - Did NOT Disappoint!,"My expectations were high but cautious. I prayed that this would be closer to X-Men or Spider-Man quality, as opposed to Daredevil or Hulk quality. And man, they nailed it! I was more completely absorbed by this than by any movie I've seen in years. That may have a lot to do with the fact that Fantastic Four was my very first Marvel and even my first superhero comic book, way back in about 1973. So I have a strong attachment with these characters. But that also meant it would be easy to disappoint me, which this movie did NOT do. Like with Spider-Man, they did a completely mind blowing job of capturing the spirit and feel of the comics. This is very genuinely the Fantastic Four!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Never so bad as to make you roll your eyes, this is fun but forgettable fluff.","Colourful, cartoony but ultimately quite camp, this comic-book adaptation successfully swings for a slightly younger audience and maintains a lighter tone throughout whilst remaining relatively true to the source material and being consistently passively entertaining. There's a nice mix of CGI (now pretty dodgy but fairly convincing for the time) and practical effects, and the team-work theme hadn't been done to death when 'Fantastic Four (2005)' was fist released so it provided a satisfying conclusion when the Four finally fully came together to defeat the enjoyably hammy villain. Though it has its share of under-cooked moments that make little sense and may make you roll your eyes, it's never so bad as to cause offence and remains a somewhat decent, if forgettable, experience. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truly enjoyable.,"This film was well put together, fun, and didn't take itself at all seriously. I am not sure where the negative hype comes from, but I find when a good film gets bad reviews, that means most people just didn't get it. In this case, perhaps from the last few comic book films that attempted to ""mean something,"" I think people forgot how to enjoy themselves. Laden with kitsch and tongue-in-cheek humor, this movie embraces that it comes from a comic book and allows itself to be big and a little silly. Yes, Jessica Alba wears an impossibly tight jumpsuit. Yes, the Human Torch is so slick and charming that, if you met him in real life, he'd get a solid smack for his arrogance. But this isn't real life, people, in case you forgot-this is the Marvel Universe, where clothes are tight and the dialog...isn't. Who cares? This movie is so fun that you wish these people did exist and would take some media focus off the jerks that are in the public eye.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic,"This is an awesome movie; if you love the comic and the cartoon; You-will-love-this-movie.

The design elements were great, the Special Effects and Technical Effects were beautiful; the storyline was as I expected, but it had even more of a bang! I loved this film; I love the comic; I love the cartoon; this film really does honor the original Fantastic Four series.Though the storyline may be altered; All Marvel films do that; but all together, this was fantastic.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Comic Book Fans...UNITE!!!,"Marvel Comics have been shelling out the comic book based movies for a while now. Spiderman, The Hulk, The Punisher, all have been transformed from paper to film. Their latest selection is the Fantastic Four.Director Tim Story (Taxi, Barber Shop) has taken on this project of making Marvel's classic comic book, Fantastic Four. The story starts with Prof. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) go to talk with Reed's old friend Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) about his Doom's helping Reed's project. His idea is to study the affects of cosmic radiation on DNA in space. Sue Storm and her brother Johnny (Jessica Alba and Chris Evans) are also on the mission into space.Due to a freak occurrence, radiation mutates the five's DNA while in space. Each now possessing their own unique power. Reed can bend his body like rubber with little effort. He is Mr. Fantastic. Johnny's body temperature is incredibly high and he can create fire and even light himself on fire. Johnny also can fly. He is the Human Torch. His sister Sue can become invisible and also create force fields for keeping things in or out around her. Sue is the Inivisible Woman. Ben is now The Thing. He is totally covered in solid rock...inside and outside. He also has incredible strength. He cannot turn his power off like the others. Lastly, Doom, like Ben, is totally covered with an element. This time it is a super hard metal. He also can absorb and use electricity. Doom goes the way of the villain while the other four join forces to figure out what happened.The movie is very much like a comic book. The dialogue between characters is written to sound like a comic book. Johnny, the hot headed character (literally), brings comedy with his quick witty remarks. Ben brings drama with his depression of losing his wife due to his mutation. The contrast between these two characters is fun to watch. Johnny is always trying to get under his skin. Even though he is solid rock, it's not hard to do. He has the hardest time adapting. With a relationship in the past for Reed and Sue, they have their own little story as well, just like a comic book. Doom, being the rich bad guy, wants nothing more than more power.Although the script gets cheesy at times, it works. There isn't as much action as I had anticipated, but when there is, there is a lot of it. Great effects make Fantastic Four an enjoyable movie for fans of the comic book, children, and adults as well. Fantastic Four is a good movie for the genre. Ben says to Sue, ""You have no idea what I'd give to be invisible..."", but I'm sure that is not the case for the movie. I'm sure a lot of people will see this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The first all prologue film.,"I get the impression this would have turned out better if they had just skipped the first film and made the sequel first.In these sorts of films the 'origin' section is a necessary part that can be the best part or as in this one just tedious.The Fantastic Four it seemed to me was 95% prologue leading to nothing at all.Over and over I kept thinking. ""ah, now the films going to start!"" But all that happened was more mediocre dialog from basic cable actors, keeping the pot boiling with a little not very impressive F/X, and even less impressive drama, in a film that I suspect was made by people who were uncomfortable to be making a comic book movie in the first place.A fantastic four minutes at the end, the rest, in my opinion just dull.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but not Great,"I enjoyed this movie, just not as much as I expected to. All of the hype about Jessica Alba wearing blue contacts so that she resembled the comic book character she portrayed, only for said contact to be visible in only one scene. Another comment frequently spoken in numerous interview was that Sue Storm was very maternal. Didn't see that at all. Bossy and controlling yes, maternal no.Now to the good stuff: Michael Chiklis was outstanding as the Thing. You got emotional depth despite an incredible make up job and the muscle you'd expect.Julian McMahon always plays the bad guys so that you feel a little bit sorry for them, as he has done this time. Such a shame to mess up his handsome face with metal makeup though.Chris Evans extremely annoying as selfish Johnny Storm, but that's true to the character so well done. Outstanding special effects helped though.Ioan Gruffurd with an American accent. The accent doesn't suit him, but the determination of his character to help his friend Ben did. Geniuses often don't see what's right in front of them, complecating everything subconsciously instead and he played that well.As a whole, the movie focused to much on three out four of the characters feeling sorry for themselves instead of helping people.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Exactly what it should be, a fun movie","Having always been a fan of The Fantastic Four, I have been eagerly awaiting this movie. I became very discouraged with the poor reviews that were coming from all directions, but, naturally, went to see it anyways.'Fantastic Four' is a fun, enjoyable movie. It's a ""comic book movie"" that portrays itself as it is, an entertaining story. It has a wonderful blend of comedy and drama. The story line of the Thing is incredibly powerful(partly thanks to a wonderful performance by Michael Chiklis), and the relationships between the heroes are very well played out.My one criticism with most comic book movies is a lot is compressed into the run of the movie, but it worked pretty well in this movie. They provided us with the need-to-know information and a story.The element I enjoyed most about the movie was how funny it was. I understand the bad reviews, most movie critics are indeed too critical and can't just appreciate a fun movie. If you are looking for a fun movie, check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Never in my life have I seen so many people complain about having super powers,"The summer was off to such a promising start of superhero movies with the release of the unbelievably good Batman Begins, so of course I was stoked to take in a sneak preview of Fantastic Four. Unfortunately, I was let down by the Stan Lee and Marvel Comic creation. Five scientists venture to deep space in order to study DNA patterns of the human body. All suffer severe changes from a space storm.4 for good, 1 for evil.Never in my life have I seen so many people complain about having super powers. I was glad to see at least the villain Dr. Doom, played by Julian McMahon, was having a little fun with his newly found powers. Most of the film is useless ""family feud"" banter between the four ""heroes."" The only real highlight of the film is Ben ""The Thing"" Grimm played by Michael Chiklis (from televisions The Shield). Excellent make-up and voice work of this rock creature, who is the only one who can't morph back to human form, steal the show.I don't think the creators were going for a comedy with this film, but that's what they got (Half the time you laugh at the poor acting). Through my disappointment overall of this film, I did find myself smiling at one crucial part of the filmJessica Alba in her bra and panties. Hey, the Invisible Woman has to disappear somehow, right? WOO-HOO!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good Comic Book Film,"I expected a train wreck going into this movie - so much so that I waited two weeks so I could redeem my free movie ticket so I wouldn't have to pay to see the film. I have to say though I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is a bit tongue-in-cheek and it doesn't have the serious nature of other superhero flicks such as this summers' Batman Begins. I found this style to be refreshing and extremely perfect for America's first comic book team. Things that I thought would bother me didn't. For example, the make up effects on The Thing were well done and actually cool - I didn't miss the CGI like I thought I would. Jessica Alba, not a talented actress in my opinion (although she's gorgeous), actually does a good job of playing up Sue Storm's sweetness. Chris Evans, who I thought would be ridiculously over-the-top, was funny and cocky, just like I would picture Johnny Storm.If you like comic book films I'd say this is worth taking a look at. It's much better than Catwoman and Elektra at least!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Flame Out,"Greetings again from the darkness. As a kid, I was a huge fan of the Saturday morning cartoon series and was very saddened when it was taken off the air due to parental concerns over violent images. Humorous when one compares to the video games that so pre-occupy the days of today's kids. The appeal of the Fantastic Four was always the isolation and camaraderie of this team. Most super heroes were isolated by their superpowers, but these four could depend on each other and were much stronger as a team than individually.Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were co-writers on Spider-man, Hulk and many others. My feelings were always that they had something special with this group. Director Tim Story is handicapped with a pretty weak cast, although Julian McMahon (""Charmed"", ""Nip/Tuck"") does a decent job as Victor Von Doom and Michael Chiklis (""The Shield"" and a memorable ""Seinfeld"") is very good as Ben Grimm/The Thing. On the other hand, Jessica Alba and Ion Gruffodd (TV's ""Hornblower"" series) recite their lines as if threatened by electric shock if they blow one. Chris Evans seems to have fun with the most energetic role of Johnny Storm but there is just not enough for him to do.Special Effects in this one are pretty decent, but the movie watches as if we are reading a comic book. I realize we are, but most of the comic-to-film projects have at least made an effort to provide a script that flows and has passable dialogue between characters. Fantastic Four makes no such attempts. This is a cartoon in every sense and that really causes it to pale in comparison to especially Spider-man, but even Hulk.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loads of fun!,"I'm a big fan of the Fantastic 4 comics and Marvel comics and film in general. I saw this when it came out in cinemas in 2005 and I've seen it 100 times since.I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So many films today are far longer than they need to be. This film is only around 95 minutes, but it's the exact length it needs to be. It move along at a nice pace and never gives you the chance to be bored.I love all the cast, particularly Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards.There are lots of negative reviews on this film, but it's a really enjoyable film, which the whole family can enjoy together. We're aged between 4 and 47 in out house and we watch this one together regularly. Don't listen to the haters!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A few flaws, but this is not bad at all.","The film does look very good, and the special effects on the whole were well done. The script is a little uneven, but the spirited performances make up for it. Michael Chiklis is very good as Ben, and Julian McMahon is enjoyably camp as Victor Von Doom. Chris Evans is spirited as Johnny Storm, though I wasn't hugely impressed with Ioan Gruffud and Jessica Alba. They just didn't convince and their chemistry at times felt a bit awkward. Also the story is a bit slow and predictable, though at least the characters were likable. Usually when the story fails the characters fail, though I felt there could have been a lot more development. All in all, a flawed but enjoyable film, that is not as bad as people make it out to be. 6/10 Bethany Cox.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic flop,"Fantastic Four was a joke. FF was a complete mess from the first frame until the last frame. The acting was sub par, the script was absolutely ridiculous and the direction was juvenile. Only one thing was remotely decent in this movie: the special effects. I did not think that a superhero film could be worse than ""The Hulk"", but I was wrong. FF makes ""The Hulk"" look like a great piece of film making. It is too bad that Spiderman and Batman have resurrected the comic book movie industry. Since Hollywood is swamped with terrible screenwriters, we have only to look forward to pitiful interpretations of comic heroes. The Spiderman and Batman Begins will be the rare treat we can hope for among this mess of garbage (Hulk, Daredevil, Electra, and Fantastic Four).",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Its not bad,"""Fantastic Four"" (2005) swings into action with a 6/10 rating, and I have to say, it was okay. The acting, particularly by Ioan Gruffudd as Mr. Fantastic, brought a sense of charm to the film, but some performances felt a bit lackluster. The film editing keeps the narrative moving, though it struggles with pacing at times. The film's strength lies in its attempt to bring Marvel's first family to life, but its weakness is in its occasionally campy execution and underdeveloped villains. The music adds a classic superhero vibe, while the cinematography captures the larger-than-life powers of the team effectively. ""Fantastic Four"" (2005) may not be the groundbreaking superhero film we hoped for, but it remains an okay introduction to Marvel's iconic team.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I miss shameless camp in superhero movies,"Before the cultural domination of the MCU and the enthronement of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies as High Art, superhero movies were marked by Silver Age optimism and pulpiness. Looking back at Tim Burton's Batman movies or the Sam Raimi Spiderman movies, they were not interested in realism or ""What would happen if superheroes were a real thing?"" They could have emotional stories and character drama, but they were at the end of the day about fun.FANTASTIC FOUR is not the cream of the old-style superhero movie. It has all the campiness of the Raimi Spiderman without as penetrating a sense of character-- but then again, that's no big issue. I was shocked revisiting this movie after many years of remembering it as hollow garbage because I ended up enjoying it a lot. Maybe it's a case of my being weary of current superhero movies which are more interested in either deconstructing old tropes or setting up a myriad of sequels in cinematic universes-- this movie harkens back to what seems in hindsight like a simpler time. I mean, just look at the climax: a simple fight in the street between the heroes and the bad guy, not a universe-shattering showdown. In 2022, that's quaint!Storywise, the script is not tight, but the characters are a lot of fun, played with great, larger than life energy by the cast. The effects have aged a bit, but the datedness retroactively adds to the film's goofy charms. It's not to be taken seriously at all and that's part of what I enjoyed so much.And I still cannot believe this movie came out when I was in middle school-- man, I feel old.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A new day is dawning! The day of the Fantastic Four!,"This film is hilarious! It is also highly entertaining and light hearted and more importantly it has the spirit of the comics and opposed to many other comic book features it doesn't have any pretensions to be something its not. I don't know why people are so negative towards this film. Obviously its not as good as Batman Begins the other super hero extravaganza of the summer but it is definitely entertaining and most actors are very well cast.Ioan Gruffudd who was extraordinarily bad in King Arthur proves that he does have talent and is worthy of being a leading actor in Hollywood. His performance as Reed Richards is unique. Not exactly like in the comics where Reed is a much older man. Instead Gruffudd makes Reed a nerdy science rat and that worked too. Rising superstar Jessica Alba plays Sue Storm and she is smoking hot. Seeing her in the blue Fantastic Four outfit really had my heart pumping but there is more to her than her pretty face and her body she actually does a somewhat decent job in bringing Sue to life. Unfortunately the chemistry between her and Gruffudd is somewhat lacking and this makes their scenes together seem a bit forced. Chris Evans is just plain funny and provides some of the best laughs in the film and his persona fits the character of Johnny Storm very well. I could not imagine anyone else in that character. He is hot-headed, brash childish and 100% lovable. Michael Chiklis has the best performance in the film and really brings out all the characteristics of Ben Grimm. He works great both as a comedic actor but also in the dramatic scenes. In short, he is excellent. The only part where I feel the casting falls short is in Julian McMahon as Doctor Doom. He spends too much time being suave and sophisticated so when the time comes for him to start being menacing it doesn't work. He is decent enough, however, but I guess the fact that in the comics Doctor Doom is pretty much the ultimate bad guy and with that kind of expectations you're bound to be a little disappointed. Stan Lee has his trademark cameo. Unfortunately this time around they gave him dialog and he is not much of an actor and his scene comes off a bit ridiculous.In terms of writing the film is not as sharp and well written as other films in the genre, most notably X-Men, but the dialog is light hearted and entertaining and some of the exchanges between Chiklis and Evans are genuinely funny. As previously stated the scenes between Alba and Gruffudd are somewhat forced. This comes, in large part, down to the writing. Their scenes are painfully American and clichéed and can be strainfull to watch. When critizising the script Dr. Doom much be mentioned as he is by no means the bad guy you could have hoped for. Much of McMahon's dialog is pretty dodgy and not as good as it could have been. The origins of the characters are almost exactly what they were in the comics and this was good. Also I found it good that not too much time was spent on the origin as this could have slowed the film down considerably. Another slight point of critique is that the movie is too short. I would have liked it to be just 10 - 15 minutes longer just to get more out of the characters.The effects were generally very well done and had a comic book feel to them which is of course appropriate. Chiklis' costume was very well done and it was probably better having it this way rather than have The Thing done in a computer as it would probably have lessened the humanity of the character. Besides the only computer generated character to date that have worked fully as it was intended was Gollum in The Lord of the Rings. Speaking of computer generated images The Human Torch is undoubtedly the best eye candy of the movie and he does indeed look absolutely amazing. Not completely believable but then again it is a comic book movie. Two thumbs way up! Doctor Doom and The Invicible Woman work as well and Doom's mask is pretty menacing and contrary to popular belief he is not inspired by Darth Vader it is the other way around. Mr. Fantastic work the first time you see the film but after having seen the film a few times you get to see that he is obviously computer generated.Overall Fantastic Four is not the best film of the year but it is very entertaining and definitely worth a look. The market is flooded with superhero movies these days and Fantastic Four doesn't really bring anything new to the screen which is probably why it scores so low on IMDb.6/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Four On The Floor,"After making movies for their other comic book titles like Spiderman, The X-Men, the Hulk, Daredevil, among others, Marvel Comics goes about and makes a film about the characters that started it all for the Marvel Universe, The Fantastic Four. Yes Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm , and Ben Grimm are brought to life in a feature film that will give them the respect and studio money that the marvel title that was billed ""The World's Greatest Comic Book Magazine"" deserves. Well it was planned that way anyway.But something happened along the way that is quite apparent that the new Fantastic Four film didn't quite meet expectations. The story is about four people, Reed,Sue,Johnny and Ben going in a private rocket ship ,funded by Reed's own money, to reach the moon. The ship doesn't reach its' destination and goes through a massive storm of cosmic rays that transform Reed, Sue,Johnny, and Ben into people with fantastic powers. This does not happen in the film however:The space flight is done for different reasons. The flight is funded by the very successful Victor Von Doom , who in the picture, is the finance of Sue. Von Doom goes with the four on the fateful flight and receives a dose of cosmic rays as well. A tremendous change from the origin of the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe that one sees in the comics.The four find out about their powers in a very different fashion than they did in the comics. Quite naturally, their portrayals don't even come close to bringing out the Fantastic Four and fleshing them out as deep well rounded characters.Ioan Gruffred looks lost as Mister Fantastic. Reed in the comics was a highly successful confident man(Tim Robbins would have been great as Reed). Gruffred ,no matter how one looks at it, isn't Reed Richards.His chemistry with everyone in the movie is readily not apparent.I know many studio executives may have thought that making Jessica Alba as Sue Storm would bring in a lot of publicity for the film and it may have. But to say a studio can't find a blond white woman to play Sue (Say Naomi Watts) is incredible. I am not a hater or anything but Sue in the comics wasn't Hispanic like Alba is. Alba and her acting skills left a lot to be desired too. Having Jessica Alba playing a scientist is a bit of a stretch that not even Reed Richards with his powers could reach.Johnny Storm in the comics was a teenager so it is hard to believe Chris Evans was to play Sue's younger brother. Huh? Evans and Alba don't even look like brother and sister(The danger of the stunt casting just mentioned above.) and Evans looks older than Alba. He does do a decent job playing a hard edged Johnny Storm. He seems to be the only member of the four who enjoys his new found powers.That can't be said for Ben, who now has become a large body of orange rock thanks to the accident. Michael Chilkis does a fine job playing the unfortunate Thing. But he like Alba seem to have no great chemistry with Gruffred. Alba and Gruffred have absolutely no chemistry with each other at all. Gruffred is old enough to be Alba's older brother but not really suited to be her love interest.Why they had to make the blind Alicia Masters into a black woman (Kerry Washington) for the movie is not easily understandable. Her comment about not being accepted by society when she meets Ben in the bar late in the film is smacks of political correctness not real human frustration.Julian McMahon makes for a serviceable Doctor Doom. But changing his story, changing how he met Reed and how he became Dr. Doom hurt the film the most. The Reed/Doom rivalry of great masterminds, one for good one for evil, is totally lost in the shuffle. As with everything else Gruffred seems to have no chemistry in his dealings with McMahon. The Richards/Von Doom rivalry is ruined even more.There is not enough action in Fantastic Four to make it an exciting movie. At the very best it is just serviceable. The final showdown between the Fantastic Four and Dr. Doom is one quick let down. The showdown is over and done with before you know it.Director Tim Story(Barbershop) seems as if he didn't really put his best foot forward into this movie.The acting, at times, is stilted and awkward. Marvel Comics could have found a better producer for this film than Story.Whereas Marvel hit two home runs with Spiderman and the X-Men, with the Fantastic Four, Marvel gets a single but gets thrown out trying to stretch it into a double. As with the creators of The Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle not having Jay Ward around to help that movie out,the creators of this Fantastic Four movie didn't have the mentoring of its' real creator, the late Jack Kirby. Stan Lee may have had his little cameo in the film. But the spirit, the flair, and the imagination of Jack Kirby was truly missing with this film. It only goes to show how much studio executives and their focus groups do to ruin feature films through their lack of imagination, their lack of experience in film making, and their own greed.The Fantastic Four is one of those types of films. We all thought that with this film, we could forget the small budget Roger Corman FF film of 1994. But it seems like we shall have to wait somewhere in the future for giving The Fantstic Four the type of film they and their fans and movie fans everywhere really deserve.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Matinée at best...,"I went to see it last night. What a severe disappointment. I mean, sure it was funny. In parts, and sure Jessica Alba is hot as a sun.. But here's my problem with it all. First of all, the movie lacked insight for more than maybe 5 minutes at a time. The banter got monotonous and the acting was a bit plastic.Jessica Alba as Sue Storm?!?! Come on, anyone that know ANYTHING about the F4 knows that Sue Storm was an older women. Not some hot 20 something. And Sue NEVER went to MIT, she was an aspiring actress. The same goes for Ioan Gruffudd, playing Mr Fantastic. Mr Fantastic was in his late 40s - early 50s not some, once again early 30s cat. They did however get his dorkiness right but not his arrogance.Michael Chiklis as Thing was a perfect casting in my opinion. He showed range and emotion. He carried Thing's burden on his shoulder as if it were his own.Chris Evans as Johnny Storm was also perfect... he was the ultimate cocky bastard. A real Hothead.Dr Doom was absolutely NOTHING like he is in the comic book. I repeat NOTHING. He was a complete disappointment. The actor that played him, Julian McMahon, had the perfect attitude to be him though.The special effects were plentiful but sometimes amateurish. Close-ups of Mr Fantastic stretching almost showed you the pixels in the CGI. The Thing's skin was much more realistic in the finished movie than in the commercials; even close up, it was dope. The Human Torch was great. Invisible girl was a bit amateurish only because they've done nothing new with invisibility.All in all, I didn't enjoy it. The score wasn't even inspiring.If you never knew anything about the F4, you might like it, but I warn you, please go during a matinée so you don't feel too raped.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good,"The movie is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated many falsehoods. The main characteristic of the film is the gloomy atmosphere, emphasizing the desolate hopelessness. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is very effective. Chris Evans gives the best performance as Johnny Storm, but Chiklis gives a good performance that is a little heartwarming. The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship between the heroes. A true gem.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Decision,"Like most super hero movies that are peeled from the pages of comic books, enjoying a movie of this genre totally depends on what your expectations are regarding them. Are you the die hard comic book fan, or the passive movie goer that enjoys action/adventure films? Did you bring the kids because you heard that it's safe for your 8 year old, and now viewing it as a family film? I read the comics as a kid. Though Fantastic Four was on the lower end of my reading schedule, there's little doubt that a legion of fans existed, and exist, that have been waiting for the full, theatrical release of them. Super heroes are a hot topic, and CG has finally caught up enough so it doesn't look like the previous release, or shall I say, non-release of the 1994 Fantastic Four that was never intended to be released to theaters. Gosh that was a bad movie.But this movie... I came with the kids, I had lower expectations & wound up being entertained. I liked Ben, Mr Fantastic, Johnny was a blast and the Invisible girl was way different the the comic, but still very sexy. But I can understand why the fans didn't enjoy it much. It lacked the impact of the comic, & it did indeed feel like it was made for the kiddys in mind. A few bits of cliché and hammy dialog didn't really make me enjoy it less, because, well, most comic book stories have them.FF felt like it was a set up for the sequel, getting character origins out of the way. And yes, it is a rated PG-13 family oriented action adventure, but barely so. It could have made a fine PG rated movie. Looking over the comments, I noticed that the fans, comic book lovers were expecting a lot more, and sometimes, that's not fair. Regular non-comic readers seemed to like it more, so I guess I was right. There's no way that a comic book with decades of stories can compact the same feeling in a movie. Just don't pull up your expectations too high, and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Banter, Alba and expensive special effects paid for by cynical advertisers","...but wasn't it fun! Well..a bit. I liked Alba's jumpsuit! For the most part though Fantastic Four (note the irritating loss of the group's personal pronoun)is a photo-chemical womb incubating a stillborn celluloid-foetus. It just might be the most cynically commercial movie you've seen in years. In fact, if your one of the gazillion companies(including Fox of course who made it in the first place) who paid up front to get the human torch on ESPN or the Thing to wear Nikes, then you must be delighted to watch a flick in which the only real characters are the corporate sponsors and the only reason to keep watching is the (vain) hope that Jessica will take off her clothes prematurely before she becomes translucent. Sure, its colourful, inoffensive stuff - cine-ice cream you might say (and even if you wouldn't, I have) but these comic book flicks don't have to be so light do they? X-men, which began this noughties marvel onslaught, had vague pretencions of substance, Batman Begins wasn't entirely mindless - it doesn't have to be this way y'know. In fact watching the Four, you're reminded of why the film snobs hate Hollywood. Its Crude, over blown commercial candy floss with admittedly likable stars who get to do very little but joke around in the kind of self-satisfied tongue in cheek style we all despise. Fox should remember that the kind of limp and fluffy Eighties comic-flicks this often resembles lead to a death of these movies toward of the end of that decade. No more of this please.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Decent Slice of Fun,"At last the Fantastic 4 come to the big screen, they were always entertaining in the cartoons and the humour has followed into this flesh and blood incarnation.Cosmic radiation transforms the four adventurers into superheroes, and a super-villain is also created in the same incident. Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chicklis and Ioan Grufford make the foursome and Julian McMahon plays the bad guy. They all do a decent job and the action is plentiful; the story is unintelligent, but amusing enough to make this a good family movie without boring the kids or the adults.It isn't as good as X-men or Spiderman, but it's good entertainment nonetheless.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The worst Marvel Comics movie since Daredevil. Unevenly paced, too campy, one-dimensional, filled with plot holes, and just flat-out mediocre.","The movie fails to establish the setting as a futuristic one populated by the fantastic inventions of Reed Richards. Instead, the setting looks contemporary, with the few sci-fi elements, like holograms and artificial gravity, appearing to be anachronisms. Even worse, they're not Richards'. In the film, Richards is a milquetoast loser and wimp, whose inventions/devices in the comic (the station/ shuttle, the shielding, the unstable molecules) are all Victor's, as is his love interest. Reed is fascinated to see a uniform made of self-regulating molecules, commenting that he's been working on a formula for the stuff. Looks like someone beat you to it, Reed.Sure, the comics have always portrayed Reed as a bit of a long-winded egghead, but not such a shortsighted dunce. The film Reed is utterly oblivious to any goings-on around him not pertaining to his calculations, be it the fact that Susan still wants him, or the fact that Victor is trying to give her an engagement ring. The Reed I read was always a decisive *leader*. Gruffudd's Reed is an obsequious cipher, and when the notion of his being the leader of the team was voiced during the bridge scene, I didn't buy it. Indeed, the characters in general are handled poorly. Their reaction to their transformation, for example, is dumb. Reed and Sue are desperate to reverse their condition. WHY? You've just got cool superhuman abilities, and all you can think about is how to get rid of them? There is no sense of sci-fi ponderousness or intellectual curiosity about this incredible transformation. They just conclude that their DNA has been altered, and decide that they have to reverse it. The only one for whom this makes sense is Ben Grimm, whose desire to revert to normal is understandable. But even this ruined by his eventual decision, following his successful reversion to normal, to recreate his rocky appearance in order to.well I don't know why he does this. Can't the others handle Doom? After spending the film depressed because his fiancée and others are frightened of him, this made no sense. Even Johnny, whose desire to parlay his new gift into celebrity was fairly believable, was portrayed as far more of an insensitive jerk than he was in the comics.The rest of the movie is one-dimensional. Doom is not the scary megalomaniacal villain, but a disgraced businessman who kills a few people for revenge. Nothing that makes him an interesting or fearful villain in the comics the shrewd planning, the leadership of a country, armor and weapons, magical powersare present. The climax is merely adequate, with Reed's defeat of him coming not from a particularly brilliant plan, but by his own admission, basic elemental chemistry. Dialogue is campy (""MarcoPolo?""), secondary characters like Alicia are cardboard, the science and plot logic is unnecessarily lousy, and much of the movie just makes no sense. Why does it appear that the team going up to the space station suits up in Doom's executive building, rather than at the launch site? Are Sue, Doom, and Richards qualified astronauts? Why does Ben's fiancée go outside on a New York City street in her negligee? Why, when testing Johnny's powers, does Sue refer to ""supernova"" as a temperature, rather than an event? Why does Reed tell the others that their costumes were exposed to the same cosmic rays that they were, so they can change like us. EXCUSE me? What? What the hell kind of nonsense is this? They're UNIFORMS. They don't have any DNA to mutate. They should change because they're made of unstable molecules. Not because they should exhibit the same reaction to cosmic rays as a human body. How can electricity incinerate a hole through a human body, when everyone who's even been hit by lightning knows that even though it burns, it passes THROUGH the body? And why, after Victor has killed that board member thus, did Johnny not suffer a similar fate later when Doom blasted him with the same energy? Why is it that twice, characters get punched hard enough to be sent flying several yards (first Johnny by Ben, and then a cured Ben by Victor), without being instantly killed? Why did Reed show no permanent effects after testing the machine intended to cure Ben on himself, which resulted in him melting? And the sequence in which Doom fires a missile at the Baxter Building is confusing. Presumably it's a heat seeker, which is why Johnny decides to lure it away from the building, and set a small island on fire (hope no one was on that island) to detonate it. But how did Johnny know it was a heat seeker? For that matter, how could it have been? Victor had to lock onto Johnny and Sue's location on that balcony to fire it, which should not have presented a signature any hotter than anything else in the vicinity.In watching this film, I kept wondering about how its basic approach and motif would work if upheld for a sequel featuring Galactus. Can you imagine these losers going up against the Planet Devourer? Instead of the ponderous awe and wonder of an immense extraterrestrial life form who consumes the energy of planets, the depth needed to make interacting with his herald seem interesting, the fear and hopelessness evoked by the impossible nature of stopping such a foe, and the moral and ethical discussions raised by Reed's desire to spare Galactus' life, we'd instead get stuff like ""Cool, an alien!"" ""Okay, let's stop him by just doing this"" or ""Wow, why does that guy look like an Oscar statuette on a surfboard?""Pass.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's ""Fantastic"" in a way I didn't think possible","If you're reading this, then there's a high possibility that you've already taken a chance or are at least interested in seeing ""Fantastic Four."" The film is big, loud, and totally captured my interest in a way that a number of movies already out this summer haven't, except for ""Batman Begins,"" which is another adaptation of a popular comic book superhero.Where other superhero flicks have probably failed or have not lived up to their full camp potential (save Sam Raimi's marvelous ""Spider-Man"" movies), ""Fantastic Four,"" surprisingly, succeeds, especially in its joy and role as a summer crowd-pleaser and I make those judgments out of amusement, not criticism. Though I'm not big on Marvel Comics' cosmic foursome, the Fantastic Four certainly do rank as their most popular team of heroic mutants outside the X-Men.Even more surprisingly, some may realize that this is not the first time Fantastic Four has gotten the green light as a motion picture; some may remember a straight-to-video version from 1994 that a lot of people merely laugh at. But this big-budget screen adaptation, directed by Tim Story (of ""Barbershop"" fame), is ""fantastic"" and fun and may be one of the better special effects bonanzas we'll see this summer.Beginning with a trip into outer space, a team of five scientists - Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), her brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), and the mission's sponsor Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) - have journeyed to Doom's space station to monitor a radioactive energy cloud that's set to pass by Earth.This energy cloud, we learn, may have been responsible for the beginning of life on Earth. A mishap in the mission occurs when they learn that the energy cloud is approaching the station hours before it was scheduled to pass by. The team members are exposed and the next thing the audience realizes, they're back on planet Earth recovering from their ordeal.They all seem fine, except that Reed's feeling a little more ""loose"" than usual, Susan's having trouble seeing her reflection, Johnny's ""hot,"" and Ben's skin is hardening. Before long, we've got four mutants on our hands:Reed becomes ""Mr. Fantastic,"" in that he can stretch, bend, and otherwise reconfigure his body and give Plastic Man a run for his money; shame about the grays though.Susan becomes the ""Invisible Woman"" - 'nuff said. Well, not exactly. She can't turn completely invisible but she can bend light, which of course doesn't amount to the same thing. But, it becomes harder to see her, which may be a disappointment to those who expected to see a naked Ms. Alba (even though she does strip a few times but sadly, we can't see her when that happens).Johnny becomes the ""Human Torch"" and with those famous words ""Flame On!"" - he's on fire - literally, and the girls are melting over him. I can still picture that famous scene where the nurse shoves a thermometer in his mouth and she reads a computer monitor and exclaims, ""You're hot!"" to which Johnny coolly replies, ""Why, thank you. So are you.""And lastly, there's poor Ben, who's my personal favorite FF member, who becomes ""The Thing,"" and he's less +Rocky+ than Stallone but more heartfelt than The Rock himself.The characters bicker amongst themselves like a close family as they try to figure out what's happening to them. After a daring rescue on the Brooklyn Bridge, the four become instant media heroes and are dubbed ""The Fantastic Four."" Johnny gets the most exposure of course, Reed and Susan try to sort out their tentative romance, and poor Ben struggles with his unsightly figure.This will all have to be brushed to the side, however, when Victor notices he's feeling a little ""steely,"" and he becomes ""Dr. Doom"" and wishes to challenge our four heroes. As it would turn out, he was affected as well by exposure to the energy cloud and he now has control over electricity and (surprise, surprise) he has plans on world domination.""Fantastic Four"" raises the bar on superhero flicks in a way not quite seen since the modern genre was kicked off with ""Superman"" (1978). I say that it is extremely enjoyable, doesn't take itself seriously, and is forever charming. This film embraces its camp elements and just goes to town with the humor, which, from my experience in the theater today, was met with a wildly positive response.As stated earlier, though I'm no FF geek, I can honestly say that this instantly ranks as one of the more fun, less serious of the lighter superhero movies. We have four excellent leads who come together on-screen and realize their lives' mission in saving the world from imminent destruction at the hands of a madman.""Fantastic Four"" is fun and flawed but likable in a way that those flaws can be brushed under a carpet and left there for good. I just hope the DVD is as fantastic as a I anticipate it should be.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No one can say that this is worse than the first attempt back in the 90's.,"Is this movie great, no, but it is fun, well sporadically at least.I had the privilege of watching the extended cut, and I prefer that over the original theatrical release.I do in particular like the cast, most of them. I do like Ioan Gruffudd as Mr. Fantastic. I thought he did a suitable job showing Reed that he is indeed a very intelligent smart man, but doesn't have a clue on how to maintain a stable relationship with his girlfriend Sue Storm, as he always over-analyzes everything.Speaking of Sue Storm, she's kinda mediocre. Jessica Alba is often bland in her performance overall, but there are few moment where she can deliver quite effectively, but she cannot deliver one the cheesiest lines in the film in the confrontation between Dr. Doom that was horribly delivered and just took me out of the movie.Ah yes, our villain, Dr. Doom, the Marvel Universe's biggest and most baddest baddie(on Earth at least). What a waste of opportunity here. A big letdown on this horrible inaccurate portrayal of Dr. Victor Von Doom. What's really upsetting is that Julian McMahon could have been a great villain, but a paper-thin script and poor characterization here completely ruins that opportunity. I will compliment the overall physical look and his costume in the film. It was quite impressive.The two highlights of this film and what makes it entertaining are Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis as Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm. They outshine the other cast member and are faithfully portrayed just like their comic-book counterparts. Compared to the theatrical cut, they are very under-utilized and the film rather focuses more on the boring romance between Reed and Sue. The extended cut goes just a little deeper on their characterization. In a way they both have the best overall emotional arc within the film, Ben learning to accept himself and Johnny learning to mature and not take advantage of his powers.The problem with this movie is the choppy storytelling and poor execution. The film spends most of it's time on these five people discovering their abilities and figuring out what to do with them, which is great and interesting, but that only works so well in short amount of time and in little douses. But here it's pretty much the whole movie and in doing so we're stuck with a forced climax that feels very rushed and very half-assed.Being a big Fantastic 4 fan, this movie is disappointing, but it isn't without some redeeming qualities. I do hope the next reboot will do some justice even though I'm very skeptical about it.Overall though this movie is harmless, yes it is with it's problems, but there are decent character moments in the film and scenes with some cool use of each one's abilities. Some of the action set pieces are fun to watch, and at least this film knows it's not taking itself too seriously for the most part.Pure eye-candy. Nothing more.6.2/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Terrible - for under 12's and die-hard F4 fans only,"Not much actually happens in this movie, so if you're looking forward to seeing the F4 doing lots of heroic stuff, think again. In fact there are only two significant action sequences: the one where the F4 are first seen by the public, and the obligatory big fight with the bad guy at the end, neither of which are particularly impressive. All in all, it feels like a TV show episode stretched out to movie length, and not a great episode at that. The writing seems like a poor TV show as well, in fact if you told me it had been written by the people who wrote Mutant X, I'd say they were having a bad day.On the positive side, there are some pretty decent effects, and there's Jessica Alba, but even she can't save this one.I see some other reviews saying this is better than Daredevil, personally I think this makes the likes of Daredevil, and even Judge Dredd, look pretty good by comparison. I feel generous giving this movie a 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Begins and Ends With a Whimper, Not A Bang","Never has a title been so fantastically misleading. This movie gave the promise of more action than it gave, disappointing audiences. The comedy was forced and awkward making it seem like more of a sitcom than a movie. The cast seemed more like the cast of ""Friends"" mutated into superheroes. The only remotely entertaining actor was Michael Chiklis as the Thing. Chris Evans also made an effort to bring life into this dying story. McMahon played Doom like Donald trump having a mood swing. He added nothing to the character and basically walked through the movie, only trying to get his paycheck. As for Alba and Gruffudd(sry if i spelled that wrong) had boring chemistry and were wet blankets throughout the movie. So much that i basically tuned out whenever they had a scene.The story was slow and unsatisfying. The acting was flat and the plot twists cliché. Instead of a thrilling action movie, this turned out to be another version of ""The Real World: Mutated"" Boring.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
fantastic!,"This was a really good movie about four astronauts who suddenly become superheroes. While on a mission, they are exposed to a strange storm which alters their DNA. They become The Thing, the Human Torch, Mr. Elastic, and the Invisible Woman. It was interesting watching their reactions to their sudden changes. The guy who became the Thing felt sorry for himself and was saddened, while the guy who became the Human Torch had fun with his new abilities. I had fun watching the movie. The special effects were wonderful. Even though the superheroes were dysfunctional, it was fun to watch them gel. The cast worked well together.*** out of ****",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Time to flame on and clobber.,"On of the first super hero teams to exist, the Fantastic Four had reached stardom throughout the years, so naturally a movie adaptation is inevitable. Roger Corman made his version in 1994, but it never had a theatrical release. This one is the film we're all familiar with. So let's flame on and take a look at this, dare I say it, ""fantastic"" film.We all know the plot: Four scientists get exposed to cosmic radiation and wind up getting super powers, thus becoming Mr. Fantastic, The Invisible Woman, The Human Torch, and The Thing. While trying to get use to their newfound powers and fame, they must content with the tyrannical Doctor Doom, who wants to destroy them all one by one. It's clobberin' time!This movie is pretty darn good. It has good action, good character development, good science (for all the nerds out there), and a decent story. All the characters are portrayed accurately and it's pretty funny sometimes when they interact with each other while other times their emotions are conveyed quite well. Doctor Doom is a great villain, absolutely powerful and deceitful, a deadly combination. The big fight in the end is worth the wait.I only wish that they add more action in this movie, like have the Thing beat down a few criminals, but what can I do? Overall, nicely done. A mostly faithful adaptation to the classic comic book.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Feels like a TV movie,"It's not as bad as Daredevil, but not much better either. This will likely disappoint a good number of fans whose expectations have long been raised by recent very good comic book-based movies like Spider-Man, X-Men, and Batman Begins.Normally in a bad movie you can say ""At least the effects were good"", but you can't even say that with this one. It looked and felt relatively low-budget, especially when it came to Mr. Fantastic stretching.The only positive I can say about this movie is that it's faithful to the comic book characterizations -- but that's not nearly enough to make a good film.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very good - satisfying,"I don't know why some people wanted more action. That has been the bane of many movies lately - focusing too much on action and special effects and forgetting how to tell a good story.This movie remembered to use the special effects to help tell the story and not focus on them. The effects were really good and many of them were used for humour instead of action. The only effect that looked a bit computerish or fake was the flame effect on Johnny Storm.The acting is decent and all the characters seem to fit the roles. They have the right attitudes and lines.There were a few scenes that were a bit contrived and we weren't sure why/how the character ended up there - for example, Johnny Storm is suddenly in a bike jumping show - but maybe he knows someone on the inside - so we will just let it go. Besides, it's a comic book.It seemed very true to the feel of the comic books. I really enjoyed this show and would recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing all around.,"They took the first family of comic books, and made a mediocre movie about them. The biggest issue is the lackluster script, with changes made in the basic characters that just did not need to be made. Dr. Doom, the comic worlds ultimate villain is worst served by this, making him into a smarmy businessman whose big threat is he wants to make more money. (The comic book Doctor Doom is a vicious dictator of a country who is a legitimate threat to take over the world. Now Dooms powers are all part of being part of the same accident that gave the Fantastic Four theirs, rather then him being a super genius inventor. The plot, what there is of it, is thin...the Four get their powers, don't know if they want them, and Doom attacks them. Thats it.The casting also suffers from Jessica Alba as Sue Storm, who, in this version of the FF, is not only a hot babe, but supposedly a genius on par with Reed Richards himself. Pointless since her supposed genius is never used in this movie, and Alba is not capable of creating an intelligent character like that.The other ""Four"" are good physically, with Michael Chiklis being an inspired choice for Ben Grimm, the Thing. The special effects for the group are also passable, again with the make up for the Thing being quite good.All in all its just a bad film. With WAY too many ""X Games"" scenes involving Johnny Storm, scene after scene of the Invisible Girl turning invisible for no good reason, and Reed Richards, Mr Fantastic shown having the common sense of a 13 year old boy.One of the worst of the wave of comic book movies to come down in the last dozen years or so. The WORST part being that essentially the same cast and crew is coming back for the sequel. I do not hold out much hope that this group can do any better the second time around.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
good fun,"I really enjoyed the movie but it is very much a cartoon movie. There are some really cheesy lines and some interesting special effects that make it great for kids and those who are willing to suspend belief for 2 hrs and be entertained. I watched it mostly because I like Ioan Gruffudd who plays Mr. Fantastic (and boy is he ever). Jessica Alba can't seem to find an intelligent movie to appear in, but lots of skimpy clothes. At least she was wearing more than she did for 'Sleeping Dictionary'. I loved 'The Thing', Michael Chiklis did an amazing job running around with all that makeup on and that's what I call suffering for your art. Overall, I found the movie campy and very unrealistic but as long as you're only there to be entertained and not educated it's a fun ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lots of hoopla and a few laughs but thats about it.,"Seeing it, I was quite disappointed. Characters weren't well written, plot was thin, and the story seemed to drag on until the end and then it was over. The film had a few bright moments of comic relief and the special effects were very good. But being a research scientist by profession, I was brought back to the old adage, never let good science get in the way of a story. The more I think about it, the less I enjoyed it. Good thing the tickets were free as I would have been upset if I had to pay to see it. This is one movie that will not get in my DVD collection. If you really are into comic book themes, might I suggest Batman Begins, as it is head and shoulders above this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Horrible, Horrible Movie.","This is one of the worst comic book adaptations I have ever seen. Yes, it's even worse than Daredevil. If you like quality film making and coherent movies with believable characters and an interesting plot, look elsewhere.The dialogue and the characters are so cheesy I literally had a hard time trying to stay in the room while this movie played. There is essentially no character development. The plot is not captivating, and there's quite a lack of anything like a climax. The effects are mediocre, but the character interactions and dialogue really take away from any possible impressiveness of those effects that are well done.I never read any of the comic books, but I don't think it's fair saying that you have to be a fan of the comics to enjoy the movie. If I wanted to read a comic book I wouldn't be seeing the movie, I'd be reading the comic book. I don't know if the tone and uh, cheesiness that's found in the movie is the same as in the comics, but I hope not. Either way, this movie has failed as entertainment. I don't know why people like it at all, unless of course they are younger than the average moviegoer.As a summary, if you're looking for a good action/super hero movie, watch the second Spider-Man movie or the first two X-men movies, those are at least entertaining and well done.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Vapid and Lifeless,"Despite the recent glut of superhero comic book adaptations, many films have actually been good enough to warrant a viewing, with some even bordering on greatness (Spider-Man 2, X2, Hellboy). Sadly, it also becomes inevitable that once in a while, we get uninspired films such as Fantastic Four.It enrages me whenever people defend crapfests like F4 calling it ""escapist entertainment"", therefore making it critic-proof because no matter how banal the dialogue or how atrocious the performances, it is just meant to be ""mindless"" entertainment right? I don't hate F4 because it's fun-spirited and candy-coated. So is Spider-Man, Singin' in the Rain, or the upcoming Charlie & the Chocolate Factory. But the reason why I despise F4 is that it never strives to be more than a heady string of superhero clichés bound together by a lame script. The whole thing reeks like stale cheese. The sorry attempts at injecting some character development (such as Thing feeling like he doesn't belong) has been done before, and done much better. F4 just wallows in its own mediocrity, perfectly self-content that it's not meant to be taken seriously anyways. And we, as the movie-watching public, have to compromise by saying ""It's good for what it was!"" But why should we compromise, when there are other, better movies out there? I believe there is no such thing as perfection in cinema, but there are films that come dangerously close to achieving it. We have the veritable pick of the litter -- why we continue to patronize trash such as F4 is beyond me.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Disappointing, yet... it has SOMETHING.","Way back in the 'golden years' of SF&Fantasy comics.... Well, at least I have your attention! Start again. Whom we referred to as 'trufans' (at least in the 'bad-old-days') are still, several generations later, almost the same people, albeit with new faces. Their passion is the same as ever and, one must admit, deservedly so. If anything has changed, it is the medium of film. CGI has changed everything - but sometimes not for/to the good.I would argue that FF is an acceptable translation from comic to screen. Unfortunately, we must compare it with others: most notably Sin City. There cannot be a favourable comparison. However, this review is about FF.Ioan Gruffudd, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans form an inspired triad. However (yet again), Gruffudd, as Reed Richards, doesn't get ""grey"" enough from the cosmic experience; Chiklis, as 'The Thing', is far more interesting as his underplayed Ben Grimm. Johnny Storm, as played by Evans, is exactly as he is in the Marvel comic: a complete, teenage pain-in-the-butt. They work off each other in an ensemble which has coherence and a dynamic.For me, Jessica Alba is a complete disaster as Sue Storm. She looks good (since when has being eye-candy been a job description for an actor? D'oh!) but hasn't the presence which the role requires.Still, the special effects are good, even if Julian McMahon (as Doom) can't quite cope with the change from human to (supposedly) insane demi-god. He's not quite 'insane' enough, and certainly not convincing.I give FF a score of six both for the special effects and because there is a sincerity behind its attempt to convert a Marvel favourite to the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Are you kidding me?,"I don't usually take too much time on a film that I had rated with one star. So, this should be quick.I read a few reviews and see that some of the film's fans feel that it shouldn't be taken seriously because it's a comic book film that don't take itself serious. Granted, that is the case. I realized that after seeing the Brooklyn Bridge scene. Doesn't mean such a bail out disguised as a lame excuse such as this should be given to a Hollywood production. They have more than enough necessary resources to make better films. That excuse doesn't have any validity with a true film goer like myself. This is probably the worse film of 2005, definitely the worst comic book film of all time.Some people compliment the acting. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Alba along with the rest of the Fantastic Four should have been called the ""OVER THE TOP POP TARTS"" instead. I think it could have been better with a stronger script and a better director. The bad acting, executing awful dialogue, prevented me from believing in the world of the story. Maybe it is suppose to be a fun comic book film, but that would never work if the individual viewer can't look past the campy acting.Some people make an excuse for the writing. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? With all the writers, all they can deliver is this steaming pile? I'm surprised the studio actually thought that this script worked. It would have been slung over my shoulder, hitting the trash with the quickness. BULLSEYE! The dialogue was so on the nose. Their efforts to be funny failed every time. I hated seeing how immature the characters were behaving when they were discovering their powers, which slowed the pace of the film for me. They were bickering like the siblings of ""The Incredibles (a vastly superior super hero film than this turd)."" Weren't these grown, educated people? I'm sorry fans. Get over it. This script doesn't work... at all.Some complimented the directing. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I mentioned the acting before. Oops... (chuckling)His bad. Not as bad as the amateurish camera work along with the poor staging of actors and extras he worked so hard to execute (Story). I didn't believe the swarm of bystanders standing around looking googly-eyed at the extraordinary things that was happening around them by the Four. The media covering the great feats played as false to me. It all felt so... fraudulent and hokey. Tim Story? Your last name doesn't compliment your abilities as a storyteller. Go back to film school.The art production sucked eggs as well. The colors were too solid. Could have benefited from the film's colors being desaturated a little. This isn't really relevant but it was just one of all the things that troubled me about this film. The whole look didn't work.Lastly, some of these novice film-goers loved the special effects. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! The special effects took the film down from a two to a one for me. I hated the scene where they first were given their powers. That looked like some cheesy video game with sub-par CGIs. The best effects I had seen in this film was when the fire truck came crashing through the side of the Brooklyn Bridge. That little moment made me appreciate what I was watching for that one minute out of the film's one hundred minutes.Also, that whole thing between THING and Kerry Washington was so stupid, clichéd and predictable that I couldn't stop throwing up.Bottom line, I'm not giving this film an excuse just because it wasn't taking itself seriously.

"aims to put a big, daft grin on your face....succeeds !","The studio have obviously looked at Spiderman, Hulk, X-men and Daredevil, and despite the varying degrees of popularity there, I think it was wise of them to make this a much lighter jaunt.This film is pure undemanding entertainment, it has nothing more on its mind than ""lets have some fun"", and dark superhero movies are getting to be a bit of a pill. I can appreciate how a big fan of the comic, would take issue with the changes that have been made, bottom line folks, your a film studio, your spending $100 million dollars making a piece of ""entertainment"", it has to play to 10 yr olds, it has to play to 30 year olds, or even 60 year olds, so what do you do? Well you can ensure your film has got some jokes, some action, some romance, some eye popping special effects, and mix in the main staples of the comic book, hey presto ! Or you can slavishly stick to every plot twist , every nuance, and every back story ever printed in the comics to please the percentage of your audience who are hard core fans of the comics. I love films ,all films, all types, but this is a business, look at Batman Begins, what a great film, but its taken it 1 month to make over $180 million in the U.S, thats not amazing business, this doesn't mean its a bad film, I thought it was amazing, but obviously a large portion of the films potential audience have shied away from it, why?, well I didn't feel it was suitable for a kid under 12 and cant imagine a large number of the fairer sex found much to their taste in there. The studios just wont pump mega bucks into something which only appeals to a limited number of punters. ""Jaws"" the book ,changes substantially, as ""jaws"" the film,there's a lot missing, didn't effect it much,in fact if you have read the book and seen the film, I think most would agree the changes were right for the film. I do hate changes to source material, one film in the pipeline (for a long time now) is ""The A Team"", words cannot express the love i have for that show, but the movie will be barely recognisable, and you've just got to swallow it. I think what you can really say is, if your adapting a book, comic, TV show, whatever, its not how close you stick to the source material that will win you the biggest audience, but how well you identify what type of film the material dictates it to be, and then make the best film you can of the type you decided on , then cross your fingers !",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Corny, unrealistic and boring","The worst of the recent comic book adaptations, that I've seen. Attempting to combine the best parts of X-Men and Spider-Man produces none of the same result, and the film ends up flat and boring. None of the characters are that interesting or even believable; they all seem like some accelerated stereotypes. The story could be a bit more intriguing if more realism and less product placement was injected into it, but, alas, that is not the case. There are a few intentional laughs, courtesy mostly the banter between the Human Torch and the Thing, but many more unintentional laughs, courtesy mostly the relationship between Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman - which occupies too much of the screen time, and reeks of a half-hearted attempt to put romance into the story. And Dr. Doom is laughably bad. All in all, not so fantastic.The acting is simply dreadful, with only Chris Evans really standing out through pure charisma. Chiklis does well considering his get-up, but you never feel for the character at all. Alba is predictably wooden, but nice to look at, Gruffudd has no leading man sensibilities at all, and McMahon is about as cheesy as it gets. The dialogue is pretty bad most of the time, topped only by the amateur direction and complete lack of realism. I know most comic book stories have to suspend your belief a bit, but this is too much. Nothing about this film seems anything close to realistic - it seems to take place in a media-controlled, brand named bubble. Not compelling stuff.The special effects are terrible, also. You'd think that since all the other comic book films have great effects that this one would, as well, but it doesn't. The Thing's costume looks painfully like a costume, and the other three's powers look painfully like digital effects. The music ranges from mediocre to just plain bad, especially attempting to incorporate the soundtrack songs in. The action picks up at the end, and the finale is relatively exciting, but then it's over - just like that. The climax is never built up and ends too abruptly. Overall, a poor effort.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Batman Begins is dark, X-Men is dark, Hulk is dark, Elektra is dark, even the first Spider-Man is somewhat dark. Fantastic Four is a returning fresh film that doesn't follow the trend of the Dark Superhero comic formula. Darkness is illuminating yes I agree, but don't you think we should tame the slumping box office game with a flame?I hope this film makes more money domestic and worldwide it deserves it a lot. I think the reason why the box office game is deteriorating is because there are no films targeted for younger audiences. Despite the film is PG-13 Fantastic Four is for everyone.

Pathetic At Best,"I had read the standard media reviews for this movie when it first was released last year and as I usually do, dismissed most of what I read or heard. Mainly because the majority of the time, I find that my tastes don't agree with the ""experts"", so I make my own decisions on what to see and then how much (or little) it appealed to me.I finally got around to renting this movie and watched it, and to my surprise, found that most of the reviews were correct: this is one waste of time from the opening titles to the end credits. The story itself is meandering and meaningless, to say the least. Sometimes that's not necessarily a bad thing - sometimes the actors can carry even the worst of films and make them a pleasant experience. Not a chance in this case. I've had pen and pencil sets that have more acting chops than any of the players here.No need to go on and on with this.....this is just a truly AWFUL, AWFUL picture and should be avoided by anyone with a trace of good taste or intelligence.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good Film Depiction of the Fantastic Four,"I own FF comics from the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. My first favorite comic as a kid was Fantastic Four; my favorite superhero was The Thing and my favorite villain was Doctor Doom. I was naturally looking forward to this film version.The casting is one of the highlights. I admit that I had my doubts regarding Jessica Alba as Sue Storm and especially Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards, but Alba does a fine job and Gruffudd was very much on the mark as ""Mr. Fantastic"" (giggle). As for the Human Torch and The Thing, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis are truly outstanding in their respective roles.What we have to understand is that the film is the ORIGIN story, so the characters are all relatively young here. Reed & Ben are probably only about thirty years old at this time (or slightly older), Sue is in her mid-twenties and Johnny is in his early twenties. Needless to say, don't expect to see a depiction of the Fantastic Four from issue #555! Some have also complained that The Thing is missing his notable rocky eyebrow but, once again, the story takes place when they first get their powers. Those of us who know our FF history know very well that he had no defining eyebrow back then. Only as he mutated over time did the eyebrow appear.What has always separated the Fantastic Four from other comic heroes is that they're a FAMILY; and all the character hallmarks of this family are wonderfully depicted in this film: Johnny & Ben's fighting, Hothead's likable show off-ness and arrogance, Reed's great intellect yet total lack of common-sense social skills, The Thing's grumbling struggle over being a monster and outcast, Reed's obsessive attempts to give The Thing back his humanity, as well as his attempts to restrain Ben when he has an understandable temper tantrum, Sue & Johnny's sister/brother bickering, etc.Other notable FF hallmarks are present as well: The Baxter Building, Victor Von Doom, Latveria and Ben's blind girlfriend Alicia Masters. Heck, even mailman Willie Lupkin is here, naturally played by FF creator Stan Lee. Also, Sue Storm's original hero moniker ""the Invisible GIRL"" is even poked fun at.Doctor Doom is perhaps the greatest comics villain of all-time and they picked a very fitting actor for the role, Julian McMahon. As for the idea of linking Doom's origin with the FF members, I don't personally mind this, minor changes are naturally to be expected when changing mediums. Where they went wrong, however, was to fail to show Victor become truly scarred and hideous -- the very reason he came to create and wear the mask and armor. Yes, there was a little scarring but it wasn't enough.Doom's costume is hit-and-miss: the hood and mask look great but the rest of it deviates too far from his great costume in the comics. Still, this was an acceptable alteration.In the comics Doctor Doom had a definite diabolical charismatic presence that would give you goosebumps. There's a little bit of this feeling in the film but it's swept away when the good Doctor SPEAKS. Yes, when Doom talks his dialogue and voice are so wimpy and nonthreatening that it pretty much ruins the part. These missteps force me to lower my rating.Some criticize that the material isn't serious enough, and maybe the creators did go a little overboard here and there with a bit of zaniness, but the overall tone is serious. Make no mistake, although there is a lot of humor (which is an essential part of life), this is not a campy joke-fest. People must understand that the FF are a colorful, fun group of superheroes; they're not dark like Daredevil or Batman. Hence, the movie is a fun, colorful and brisk film, yet it remains essentially serious.One thing I fail to comprehend is the ridiculous bashing the film has received. ""Fantastic Four"" is every bit as good as ""X-Men"" which came out in 2000; both films are about the origin of a superhero team. Have we been so spoiled by the great superhero films since then (e.g. Spider-Man 1 & 2, X-Men 2, Daredevil Director's cut, Batman Begins, etc.) that we can no longer recognize or appreciate a fine comic film? If ""Fantastic Four"" came out in 2000 before ""X-Men"" it would have been deemed a superhero masterpiece.So many people rave about how great ""Spider-Man 2"" is, and it is a well-done superhero film, but what about the stupid subplot regarding Peter losing his spider-powers because of his lack of confidence? Since when did Peter's spider-powers depend on his confidence? His powers were derived from a radioactive spider bite; hence, his powers would not come-and-go depending on his confidence level! I'm just pointing out that, as good as ""Spider-Man 2"" is, it is not without its flaws.BOTTOM LINE: This is a good and fun film version of the Fantastic Four. The missteps with Doctor Doom are its only real shortcomings. If you like or love the Fantastic four, or just have a casual interest in them, you'll likely enjoy it. If not, why are you reading this?GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

However, I will say that I was pleasantly surprised with the results of this silly, but ultimately fun movie.Fantastic Four, as everyone knows is about five scientists who travel into space to study a space comet, when the comet hits the shields of the station they are on.Each of the scientists returns to earth with a new power. Reed Richards becomes Mr. Fantastic, and can make his body stretch like rubber, Susan Storm becomes the invisible woman, who can turn invisible and can create shields, Ben Grimm becomes The Thing, a superhuman of enormous size with incredible strength, and Johnny Storm becomes The Human Shield who can ""flame on"" at any time and fly! Also on board is the evil Victor Von Doom who eventually becomes one of the greatest villains in Marvel history, Doctor Doom who can generate massive amounts of energy and whose body becomes the hardest metal on Earth. He's definitely my favorite character in the film! Of course with this being an origin story, it takes time for things to get moving, but once the chips are firmly in place, the film takes adventure to new heights.Sure, it's not the best film of the summer, but I did enjoy it throughly.

No Center,"We are seeing a new genre be invented and the process is quite thrilling.No one really knows what the genre will actually be, what it will look like and what few things will characterize it. So dozens of teams take stabs at it. Most will fail so utterly (like this one) that it will tell the next makers and us where the center might be.It isn't fair to criticize a movie unless you criticize it for what it is intended to be, how it exists. The problem is that F4 and ""Hellboy"" and even ""X-Men"" don't have a center yet, don't have a scale.So we must just judge it on its components: was the girl sexy? were the explosions loud enough? was the villain cool? and so on.If you find someone doing that, just walk away. But don't necessarily walk away from the movie.I cannot recommend this movie as one that satisfies. But if you are interested in cinema, you have to watch this and things like this to understand how movies find their grooves.

Someone left the Fantastic out of the Four...,"Take one of Marvel Comics best super-teams and basically throw out the basic guiding principles that made the Fantastic Four a good read over these last 40-some years and that is what you end up in this film adaptation.Granted one had to change a few details to get all the players changed as quickly as possible, but fans of the comics are sure to cry foul that the origin of the classic Dr. Doom is tied with the creation of the Fantastic Four! Fans of the comics know that Dr. Doom never worked with Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) in the same organization. The well know origin of Dr. Doom starts off when Reed and Victor van Doom are together in college. Victor gets disfigured in an lab accident that he believes that Reed interrupted. Victor heads out in the world to seek more power than mere science can give him and he discovered mystical powers and takes the armored form of Dr. Doom.This film throws Victor into the same accident that caused the Fantastic Four to be created.But instead of getting disfigured, this Victor von Doom is merely scarred and yet he goes around wearing a metallic mask without the rest of the famous body armor of Doom. The whole presence of this Dr. Doom makes people laugh, where as the original Dr. Doom was considered by many as one of the top ten most dangerous villains in the Marvel Comics universe.The strange mix of CGI and non-CGI proves a bad combo in this edition of the Fantastic Four! Mr. Fantastic, the Human Torch, the Invisible Girl/Woman are represented with CGI powers.But the Thing is merely an actor in makeup and unfortunately looks more campy than someone that should scare the normal populace or be any real threat.Not up to par with the kind of effort that the previous Marvel Comic films, Spider-man or the X-men received!!!

Fantastic? I wouldn't go with that...,"I am a huge fan of comic books based films, even though I haven't read the books. I enjoyed spiderman (not #2) and I loved both xmen. Based on the comments of other users in here, I decided to watch F4, because they were all saying it is fun. And that is all that matters in such films.Well, it wasn't. First of all, I left with the impression that I watched a 50 minutes movie. It doesn't show that much. The first part actually shows nothing of interest. What you might have seen in trailers, well...that's pretty much it. There are no more action scenes, no fights between F4 and Doom. Actually, the only have one scene together, where they fight each other and then it's the end.The CGI's are at least ridiculous.. The Thing came out nice, Jessica had the easiest part, I guess..but Mr. fantastic was, not even funny.. ridiculous. The first time I saw his hand stretching, I thought, OK, there is something wrong here. Not only it looks unreal, but if feels kind of silly, watching a grown up man stretching up the way he does. There is a scene where he has his palms in Thing's head. If you notice, you can see its pure cgi. And its pure slash bad cgi.The acting is... and this is where this sentence could stop. Or rephrase, there is no acting. Mr. Fantastic is a bit annoying, he doesn't know what to do with his hands, his normal ones! Jessica is.. Jessica, and she does that pretty well, period. Johny came out nice, funny..but after a while he enters the 12 year old boy mode with his sister: ""you know what, you're not mom"". The Von Doom character was played quit decent by Julian McMahon... Overall, the casting was a big failure.Other than that, the film features some nice shots of new york, building lights at night, some aerial shots. The music sounds cheap, the crashing cars elements are pretty nice, I especially liked the ones used in the bridge sequence.I was very much disappointed by this movie.

"Good Yarn, Good Story","When I was a kid, Marvel Comics were my faves. The names of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were almost magical to me. And yes, I read, and liked, the Fantastic Four.FF were different from a lot of comic book heroes for a number of reasons that were well depicted here in the film.First, and maybe most obviously, there were four of them. Instead of a single powerful character, like Superman or Batman, we had a group of Four. It has been remarked again and again that the TV show Friends was distinctive in the same way: a breakthrough comedy in which an ensemble of 6 equal characters are ""the Star"". Well, FF was in many ways like Friends: a super ensemble.Second, the heroes were all so very human. Lots of very human foibles and weaknesses. That comes through very well in this film.Third, the experience of the heroes is more important than the heroism of the heroes. This is conveyed by the film very well. When Sue Storm steps forward in the space station to look out over the earth from high, high above, we see her face reacting like ... well, like almost any of us would react: astonished, grateful, delighted. The scene is very unoriginal, yet it's set up with flawless adherence to the spirit of the situation, and we are conducted with a true story-teller's love of story through the brief but telling scene.Similarly, the *experience* of gaining their new ""powers"" is conveyed with humor and authenticity and who among us can't feel the same sense of adventure and terror and horror and fun that our heroes experienced as they grew into their new selves.The *pattern* of correspondence and discordance between new powers and character is very striking. Two of the Four gain correspondent powers; two gain discordant powers.Correspondent are Johnny and Ben. Johnny, fiery, rash, brash, hotheaded, becomes the Torch. Ben, strong, rough, gruff, becomes the powerful Thing.Discordant are Reed and Sue. Reed, the intense and flexible scientist, becomes ""Stretch"", sending his body into extraordinary feats of relaxation and flexibility. Sue, the extraordinary beauty, finds that her most salient power is to become invisible, her beauty hidden from even the most piercing eyes.All four of the Fantastic Four ""mesh"" in ways that tell us that the Four who related with balance and humor before the Great Change, will continue to relate with balance and humor after the Great Change.Finally, to embed the new experiences of the Fantastic Four in the heart of New York, with tributes to the NYFD and NYPD clearly reminding us of these heroes of 9/11, is to help universalize the transformative experiences that they, and we, have undergone. No one has planned for the changes that have taken place: yet all have labored to accommodate those changes and make them part of who we are as we experience ourselves, and our life, on a daily basis.I think this is one of the distinctive gifts of the Comic Book world: to help us see life in broad, bold strokes, so that we are forced to lift our eyes above the dust and grit and see the big picture, the big themes.Unfortunately, this is a two-edged sword. Comics are cool, but their broad strokes cloy and tire and ultimately bore very rapidly. The movie could have been half as long as it was, and I would have been well satisfied.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Waste of my time,"I can't imagine that I'm the only person, who thought that this movie was a terrible disappointment? First of all the script was incredibly stupid even for a superhero movie. The dialogue was appalling and every time someone of the characters opened their mouth I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The actors were as believable as the lame special effects, there was NO chemistry between Alba and whatshisface, the Torch dude seemed mostly retarded and the Thing did not even look or sound like anything as massive as he should be (Christ, Tom Waits alone has a more rough tone to his voice than this guy).I have never posted a review on IMDb before but this movie made me so mad that I just had to.

Fantastic Four = Fantastic Film!,"I truly think this is the best comic book movie ever made and I'm not exaggerating. Everything in this movie gets exceedingly better as the film plays out.

Well, maybe except for The Thing's obviously not-CGI suit, which is a good thing. Michael Chiklis is the best thing about this movie, acting-wise or otherwise. The movie seemed rushed. Lots of continuity problems. Stretching it to 2 hours wouldn't hurt. I guess the studio had to consider viewers's short attention spans. What a shame.

As such, I had my standards set to ""low."" Even when I was expecting nothing, this movie disappointed me. Now one might say ""Ed, at least the special effects were cool,"" which they were, but a turd is still a turd polished or not.With a climax so anti-climactic and acting that wouldn't convince a toddler, I deem this movie unfit for human consumption.

"Acceptable, but could be better.","Fantastic Four (2005) -This is definitely the best Fantastic Four film released so far. I'm not sure that they have ever been done proper justice, although personally the team doesn't do much for me anyway. I think that their mutations are a bit restrictive and the elastic man idea is a bit camp and comical and I'm never really clear on the full extent of The Invisible Girl's powers.The Thing, The Human torch and even Dr Doom are interesting enough characters, but the other two don't really get a chance to shine or show their abilities as much, certainly in this interpretation. They tend to utilise their brains more and the focus is on their attraction to each other, which isn't usually what the action fans turn up for.I actually don't know the comics very well. I've only read a few as part of my vain attempt to read all of the X-Men storylines and they sometimes crossover, but Ioan Grufford and Jessica Biel don't feel quite right in their roles, which might also contribute to their characters seeming less relevant.Chris Evans though feels spot on. As if he wasn't hot enough already though. Am I right or am I right? He is just gorgeous and delivers the reckless Johnny Storm perfectly.I also like Michael Chiklis in his role as The Thing. You get some emotional value from his storyline which adds to The Human Torch's more fun and daring element.However, Julian McMahon is soooo slimey. He's not perfect as Victor Von Doom, but for the most part he plays psychotic and nasty very well, but he also makes my skin crawl.The film itself is a bit slow overall. They get a lot of plot points in, but it doesn't move very fast to get to the action or the confrontations with the bad guys. I think that's why it wasn't very well received by critics. It's a very simple story and focuses on the origins a bit too long.If I was making a new Fantastic Four film, I would probably do a montage of how they got their powers at the beginning as part of the opening credits and then I would concentrate on a new enemy (Not brand new, just not Doom again) for the main body of the film and in a way that gives the characters a real chance to shine and prove themselves, which they haven't had the opportunity to do in the existing releases. Something similar to 'Spider-Man 2' (2004), but with a bit more oomph. It's difficult, because I can't think of any sequels that have really been stand out. I suppose X-Men 2 (2003) is the best, but that might be because I love Hugh Jackman with those claws. Either way, the point is that I want to see excellence in a sequel too and in the case of these heroes, we already know their origins, give us a reboot with a great story right from the start and skip over that part.621.02/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Horrid writing, deplorable casting and acting that would make B-movie actors look away in shame","Seldom do you see a movie that looks so bad from the beginning, that no matter how many fanatics tell you it's great, no matter how often the thought that it might actually not be that bad hits you, it doesn't even in the least affect that deep down, in your core, you know it will be just as bad as you knew from the start. This is one such movie. I've spent the last twenty or so minutes searching for something, anything in the film that should, nay, must raise the rating above the absolute lowest score I could give it... with no luck. The plot makes little to no sense. It's clearly just put together in order to bring the comic book characters to the big screen. It also seems like the writer(s?) didn't have more than one idea for the script, so he just reused it over and over. One of the members are unhappy... start a fight, get angry, leave. That takes place two or three times during the film, with little to nothing separating them. Just as they get back together, someone new is discontent. That's not a film, that's a bunch of different takes on the same short stitched together to reach minimum length for a feature film. The pacing seems non-existent. Scenes go on and on, and there's no telling how far you are from the end. The acting is mostly bad. The casting is completely off, for pretty much(did I say pretty much? Scratch that) every character. Susan Storm as a mulatto? Reed Richards as a thirty-something? What is wrong with you people? Also, let me just make it clear, I'm not a fan of the comics whatsoever. I loathe their powers, I hate Johnny Storm and I despise how much everyone else(other superheroes included) look up to them. So I'm not one to criticize inaccuracies. But come on! The writing is incredibly poor. There are lines that make no sense, lines that have no humor to them whatsoever, and lines that make you cringe... guess the writer knew it was poor and decided to just throw in everything he could. To give a quick example, one character says, in full seriousness, to describe another person: ""You're such a dork!"" Yes, honestly. Character motivations and development just isn't there. Look for it as hard as you will, it ain't there. The humor rarely ever works, and is completely juvenile in tone and nature. The writers come up with one or two scenes that have attractive actors of both genders undressing, for no other reason than eye-candy. Just for anyone who cares, no, there's no nudity, and the two actors are Jessica Alba and Chris Evans. Sure, she's hot(and I'm certain most females would think that description is fitting for Evans), but when there's no point to it whatsoever, it just leaves you feeling offended as a viewer. For a comic book movie, there's nearly no super-villain action whatsoever... there's one fight, and it's very short, at the very end. That's all, folks. Now, since there should be some positive stuff in any review, no matter how negative it is... Julian McMahon is great as Dr. Victor Von Doom, and he may actually even be well-cast. I *love* him as a villain, from seeing him on Charmed for several years, and he repeats the success here. Problem is, he has way too little to do, and far too little screen-time. Then there's the special effects... I can't deny that most of them look great. Still, those two things aren't enough to bring this above bottom rating. Less offensive to the fans than Spiderman, but more poorly produced. Just bad in pretty much every way. Keeps some of the comic book tone, but not one to make a point of seeing. I recommend this to special effects junkies and people who care just enough about the comics to see the movie, but still little enough to accept the many inaccuracies. No real fan should be subjected to it, unless he or she can accept how much they screw up. Again, it's not as bad as Spiderman on that front, but it's still pretty bad. 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Despite an underwhelming reputation, the fact is ""Fantastic Four"" is harmless fun that does a decent job at being entertaining, despite not being particularly good.","Back in 2005 (wow time flies), in the aftermath of other big comic-book films like ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"", Marvel and 20th Century Fox unveiled their long-awaited (and long-time coming) feature- length ""Fantastic Four"" adaptation. (Well, technically it was the second adaption, with the first being a low-budget unreleased B-movie in the 90's, but I digress) General audiences seemed to enjoy it to an extent upon release (at least in the real world, and not the negative-Nancy world of the internet), but critics weren't thrilled at all. And since its release, the film (and it's sequel to a lesser extent) have gained a somewhat mixed (if not even slightly negative) reputation.So where do I stand on this film? Somewhere in the middle. I can't objectively say that it's a good film, but at the same time... I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the heck out of it as silly entertainment, and still watch it from time to time. It's a very fun, light, simple flick that doesn't take itself seriously, and I think that does give it value. Sure, I like my deep, metaphorical dramas and thrillers... but sometimes I want to shut my brain down and watch CGI, action and silly jokes, which is what this film specializes in.We follow Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), who convinces his former colleague, the self-centered Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) to allow him access to Von Doom's privately owned space station, in order to study an interstellar cosmic storm that he thinks may be linked with evolution on Earth. Together with his astronaut friend Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), genetic scientist and former flame Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), and Sue's brother Johnny (Chris Evans), Reed and Victor head to the space station. However, a miscalculation on Reed's part causes them to inadvertently be hit by the full force of the storm, causing bizarre mutations in each person- Reed gains the power to stretch his body like rubber, Susan can turn invisible and create short- lived forcefields, Johnny gains the power of fire and can fly, and Ben becomes a giant rock-like creature dubbed ""The Thing.""After inadvertently being unveiled to the public during a heroic rescue, they become media darlings, and begin to try and work out a way to return themselves to normal. However, Victor (whose body has slowly began to turn into an organic metal-like substance in addition to gaining control over various forms of energy) slowly begins to unravel, deciding to seek vengeance on the so-called ""Fantastic Four"", before using his powers for other nefarious deeds.The cast is sort-of mixed, but I do feel they have a great chemistry on- screen, even when all of the performances aren't up-to-snuff. Gruffudd and Chiklis both basically rule the film, both giving great performances that ground the film and make it work. Chiklis in particular, who is able to make ""The Thing"" both fun and tragic all at the same time. Evans (who would later go on to become Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films) does alright as Johnny, but I think he pushes the humor a bit too much and played Johnny a bit too snarky. (Though thankfully he fixed this in the second film) Alba is beautiful, but as in many of her roles, her acting is mixed. She's great in some scenes, but underwhelming in others. McMahon does make for a very decent villain, though, despite a lot of his dialog being nothing but clichés we've seen done before in other films, and he seems to be having a good time being an over-the-top comic-book bad-guy.The script is where the film sort-of falls apart. It's too much of things we've seen too many times before. It's very paint-by-numbers, you could say. Even though the cast does have a chemistry, the writing just doesn't do them justice, and it definitely does not to justice to the source material. When everything spoken is cliché, and when the ""science"" presented is more laughable than believable, there's an issue. I also took issue with the pacing, and how little actual action there was for what should have been an action-packed movie. (There are really only two ""big action sequences"", whereas most action films have at least 3-4 big action sequences.)Direction courtesy of ""Barbershop"" director Tim Story is also a bit underwhelming, but at the same time, I can't say it's poorly directed. Just basic. Which I don't find surprising since Story hadn't done anything like this prior. That being said, I do think he has an alright visual style, and his choice of composition, visuals, etc. are fine. Nothing to write home about but fine.However, those problems just can't stop me from enjoying this film for two simple reasons- First, the cast does have a good chemistry, which is able to overcome much of the cliché-ridden issues with the writing. And second, the film doesn't take itself too seriously, and constantly tries to give us fun humor as we see the Four as a family who don't always get along. Sure the jokes don't all hit, but enough do that I found myself chuckling at a reasonably consistent rate. And really, that's more than I can say for many films- this movie doesn't want to be dark and brooding, it wants to be light, fluffy and silly. So I can forgive a lot of the problems, because that is admirable in this day and age. There aren't enough light-hearted action flicks these days, so I found myself embracing this film.So yeah. Sue me. I enjoy it as a piece of silly, fluffy entertainment, and I don't think it's as bad as it's reputation suggests.I give ""Fantastic Four"" about an average 6 out of 10.

No matter how much the source material tells of a story about characters surviving with superpowers in the wide open public, society (especially the police) hate vigilante antes. If it was up to them, they'd let these show stoppers of the crime fighting type to go around a few times, solely to figure out what it is that makes them tick. They'd then capture them (already knowing their weaknesses, of course), get a bunch of scientists to study them, then finally charge them with whatever damages they've caused, regardless of what good they did.It's this aspect of post-modern society that has been incorporated to most superhero films of late. Most superheroes must quickly leave after there job is done to ensure the feds don't come knocking (Spiderman, X-men), most are concealed too well in the darkness to ever be known as nothing more than a myth (Batman), others start off with the problems mentioned in paragraph one to begin with (The Incredibles), and others work their way up to be recognized as something of good (Batman, Superman).It's this factor that is completely thrown out the window in ""Fantastic Four."" Here we have a bunch of researchers-cum-superheroes wanting to save the world, keep the world happy, show themselves off, and resolve personal problems all at the same time. In short, it's attempting to conquer what every other superhero film has in less than two hours.The comic book could do this mix into perfection, making it the longest running of all Marvel creations. But the movie, headed by rather incapable director Tim ""Babershop"" Story, misses every aspect of the comic that inspired Stan Lee to keep on truckin' at Marvel.The acting is reduced to nothing. At first, you'd think it's the fault of the actors, regarding the already bland performances given by Ioan Gruffand and Jessica Alba. Yet, when we begin to see Chris Evans and Julian McMahon trying hard to bring something in other than dry humor and clichéd action phrases, you see that the problem lies with the screenwriter, Micheal France.You can bet that instead of actually writing something, he took references from his past work on films such as ""Goldeneye"" and ""Hulk,"" as well as from all the past Marvel movies.The special effects are great and all, but it's all been done before. Every great achievement ""Fantastic Four"" has in CGI technology can be derived from Spiderman, Lord of the Rings, or any Disney/Pixar Film. What is worse is that in the middle of three complete CGI characters, The Thing is supposed to pass off as a piece of walking desert in a suit that less believable than most at Comic-Con. Take the only good page from ""Batman and Robin,"" and do a mix of CGI and a prosthetic suit for your bulky characters.Purists will probably be fuming from the head by now, yet there's bad new for you as well; comic to movie continuity is non-existent. As explained before, the original story that brought out a great family with fantastic powers (no pun intended), is made into another episode of the ""Power Rangers."" One big difference is Dr. Doom, now funding the four's project, is going out with Sue Storm, and instead of going ugly after a while with his powers, stays the same way (obviously for some more beauty shots of McMahon) and wears a metal mask for no reason.I had the same feeling watching this film as I did watching ""Rocky III."" That is, the feeling of being only being slightly entertained, and noticing a formula wearing thin. The only upside is that it's a much lighter superhero flick than what has been offered in recent times. In theory, this should have been the film to take your kids to if you didn't want them to see the darkness of ""Batman Begins."" Yet, if you are wanting to see less violence after a rather large amount of ""dark"" summer blockbusters, rent ""Superman"" or Tim Burton's ""Batman.""",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Had a great time!,I had a great time at this movie. I didn't really know what to expect - but this movie is pure summer popcorn fun! Everything else I've seen so far has been pretty heavy and dark - this movie is fun and a great time. Jessica Alba is HOT HOT HOT. And I love Chiklis from The Shield - he is awesome as The Thing. My girlfriend loves Julian McMahon - and he was good as Doom. The best was Johnny Storm - he really surprised me. I think we'll be seeing more of this guy. I didn't know much about the Fantastic 4 before I went in - and I now I'm definitely into the characters. And the effects are great.I definitely recommend this for everyone - it's a great summer movie. Not going to win any awards - but is perfect fun to get out of the summer heat.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A guilty pleasure, but only because of Chris Evans","I thought this was one of the worst comic book movies I've seen after a long string of passable to exceptional adaptations. It gets plenty of good reviews here so maybe I'm just missing something, but for me the appeal of the comic book movie isn't just in making you believe comic book characters could really exist, but that they could really exist in the same world as the rest of us. My problem with Fantastic Four is that there's enough cheesiness to break the illusion of reality. I never followed the comics, but if you only knew the characters from the movies, you'd think every fight was a carefully orchestrated scenario to make the Four use their powers together as a team. All told, the plot was weak, the characters weren't fleshed out very well, and the acting was pretty poor.All that said, I do own a copy of it on DVD I bought used for five bucks, and the only reason I own it is for Chris Evans as Johnny Storm. He's the only actor who turns in a really good performance (even Julian McMahon, who I know to be a solid actor from his other work, didn't really impress me here, but I don't think he had very much to work with), his is the only character who comes off as someone you could find in the real world, and he's just too damn fun to watch. By himself he's not enough to save the film, but you get the feeling that if he ditched his teammates and got his own movie, it'd be a lot more fun than the hundred and six minutes sunk into watching this flick.I like the serious comic book movies out there because they have a solid story to tell and they show people who aren't into comics that it is possible to use the medium to tell a solid story. At the end of the day, I just don't see Fantastic Four doing either of those things.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's just the same old thing,"After seeing The Fantastic Four, I felt like I was watching over the same old movie again and again. Maybe it could have been amazing ten years ago, before ""X2"",""Spiderman"" ""Hulk"", ""Batman Begins"" or ""Revenge of the Siths"". But if you saw any of the movies above, it will be very hard to be surprised by this one.First of all, the cast was not that good. Jessica Alba seems too young for Susan, and Chris Evans just doesn't seems to fit his role. Mr Doom is very laughable and it's not scary at all, specially because is interpreted by that guy from ""Nip Tuck"" we're all used to see as a ""casanova"". The rest of the cast (and the two most important characters, Mr. Fantastic and The Thing) are kinda unknown, but that's not really a bad thing. I think that the major problem with comic movies is that''s really hard for fans to get used to see a real person incarnating his/her childhood hero. So, the less famous the actor, the better.About the plot, all I can say it's a bit disappointing, and it has all the flares and holes that this kind of movie seems to have. It's not a bad movie, but it's not original. So to speak, you won't find anything new in ""Fantastic fours"", but you won't fall asleep either.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I'd call the ""Mediocre Four""","Well, after watching the ""crap-tastic"" 2015 remake, I've decided to give the 2005 version a shot and well, it's not really that good. But, if anything, it's better than its' sequel, yet not as good as ""The Incredibles"" or the 1994 F4 movie or the 1990's animated series for that matter. Still, the final showdown with Dr. Doom was actually enjoyable to watch than the 2015 remake's ""final showdown"" since that one sucked so much, I was left very bitter at the end.So, I suppose, if you're like really to see a perfect representation of a big-budget Fantastic Four movie, you're not gonna get it with this movie, but...I would suggest that you skip to the final showdown with Dr. Doom since that actually felt like a real Fantastic Four fight scene, and like I said before, you're better off with the Incredibles, instead. Or just go pick up an issue of the Fantastic Four comic books, or go watch the 1990's animated series for that matter.Final score....""6 out of 10""""Flame off!""",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Light hearted but Good,"Chris Evans must have been pretty busy in his alternative life as Johnny Storm and Captain Avenger!!! I must admit this is a pet hate of mine, I always thought it makes a franchise (before they were called franchises) more believable if the actors were unique to the characters and not renowned for something else (Hello Ryan Reynolds) lol.Good movie that balances gentle action and some fun moments especially from Chiklis. The effects are excellent and fit within the movie really well so they add to the story rather than distract you from it.Flame on!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awful for those with an interest in the comics.,"Marvel spent 30 years developing these characters, but the movie makers clearly felt no sense of responsibility to that history. The recent X-Men, Spiderman, Batman and Superman films demonstrate what can be achieved in this genre. Unfortunately, The Fantastic Four reminds me most closely of the Captain America TV movie of the early 1980's. It shares that film's shoddy production standards (despite an evident mega-budget) and complete lack of respect for the characters. The script, dialogue and acting are all weak.

"In the words from the Jizz-Mopper in Clerks... Mr. Story, ""You've Highly Offended Me!""","I just saw Fantastic Four (January 2nd, 2007), and actually I did it 'cause of the trailer from Rise of the Silver Surfer. I was waiting for the film to open in 2005 at cinemas, but when EVERYONE I know told me that the movie sucked, I just had to resign the hope that I had to see another incredible comic adaptation, the hope to see the Fantastic Four in action.I don't think I can recall a movie where the director had so little (not to say ANY) knowledge of the script that he was about to work on. The key scenes lacked from ANY interest, the characters are poorly developed. I'd like to take a little while in this subject, 'cause many of my friends told me that was a really bad casting, but I have to say... Its not the best casting, but could've been worked out correctly. Sadly for us, the TRUE BELIEVERS, this movie is not the case.It lacked the thing that I will always be looking' on a comic book adaptation (Besides to be a flashy display of effects with a killer photography i.e. Hulk, Superman Returns, Batman Begins), and that is for EVERY character, it doesn't matter to be villain or hero, to be HUMAN! as Eric Bana on Hulk, as Peter (Mostly on Spider-Man 2, not so much on the first one) and lately perfectly molded by Bryan Singer, a Clark Kent who is an Alien more human than any character on any comic book adaptation I've ever saw. I really hope that Mr. Story has taken a few classes about comic book appreciation (and film making wouldn't hurt him either) and don't become another Brett Ratner killing for good a series that STILL can be saved... Mr. Story, you had ruined this first movie and still got a second chance, don't blew it the next time...To every future director from a comic book adaptation, please: Take your time, read the characters, fell in love with'em and then ONLY then, sign your contract...

The dynamic between the main characters is engaging, and the film does a commendable job of exploring their individual struggles and personal growth as they come to grips with their powers.""Fantastic Four"" (2005) successfully captures the essence of the original comic book, delivering a sense of adventure and camaraderie among the team members. The action sequences are well-executed, and the film's visual effects, while not as advanced as modern superhero films, hold up well and effectively bring the characters' abilities to life.The cast, including Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis, brings charisma and chemistry to their respective roles, adding to the film's overall appeal. The movie's light tone and optimistic spirit make it a refreshing addition to the superhero genre, offering a break from darker, more serious adaptations.Overall, ""Fantastic Four"" (2005) is a fun and enjoyable superhero film that successfully captures the adventurous and lighthearted nature of the source material. While it may not delve into deep, complex themes, it excels in delivering an entertaining and engaging experience for audiences of all ages.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It makes me painfully aware how that money could have been used to do something for the benefit of society.Jessica Alba was quoted as saying ""All I can really do in being invisible is eavesdrop, you know what I mean, like, what else could you use it for? Not having to pay for a plane ticket or something?""

A Cookie Cutter Superhero Flick.,"This must be one of the worst films to come out of 2005.It's a bog standard superhero flick, but with characters that are impossible to really feel for or even care about, action that peters out fairly quickly, and a plot that you've seen a thousand times before. It seems pretty obvious that the Studio was convinced that all you really need to make a superhero flick is wafer thin characters a lot of garish colours.What I find incredible is that the Studio had hundreds of ppl looking at this film as they made it, and nobody seems to have realized that it was rubbish. And it isn't as if there weren't some decent superhero films to cop ideas off. Spiderman, for example, was a much better film.Even if you have nothing better to watch, don't bother with this film.

"Hello rock, this is me in between you and the hard place.","Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) & Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). All set off on a space mission that sees them engulfed by a mysterious storm that imbues them all with different special powers.Fantastic Four is arguably the most loved on the page of the super-group comic book creations. Certainly it's Marvel's flagship offering in that corner of the super hero market. Odd then, that when it finally makes it to the big screen they throw money at it but employ the director of ""The Firing Squad"" & ""Taxi""? The whole film reeks of nervousness, with director Tim Story either fearful of making a hash of said flagship movie, or worse still, being directed himself by studio executives fearful of making a hash of said flagship movie. While the casting of Gruffud (dull), Alba (cleavage for hire) and McMahon (out of his depth as a villain) beggars belief. Sloppy CGI fails to ignite what little action there is, while the final smack down as our intrepid 4 battle with Von Doom, is of a TV movie standard. Yet it still has a smidgen of fun about it to warrant investing a damp dark afternoon with.Chiklis and Evans are the plus points, the former injecting a bit of heart into proceedings and the latter some sexiness and some much needed humour. There's also some worth in the script's attempt at messaging about the perils and pitfalls of celebrity status. While who can deny that the first appearance of ""flame-on"" & ""clobbertime"" doesn't induce an ickle tingle down the spine of the discerning comic book fan (ok that may just be me hankering for my youth). If only the film wasn't so safe and had been in better hands. But hey! the film turned over a $230 million Worldwide profit, so what do I know eh? The sequel was inevitable, so one can only hope that with the same people involved they not only learn from their guardedness, but that they manage to stay faithful to the source and give it some much needed pizazz.Footnote: The extended cut at twenty minutes longer, suffice to say, is a better experience as it has more pizazz.

An Honest Review,"At least it is better than the reboot.Mr. Fantastic is distant like he is in the source material, but not as distasteful. You sort of get the impression that he's kind of a cold-hearted jerk in the comics, refusing to help people and pushing them to make deals with Doom because he doesn't see the time sacrifice as a benefit to himself and his research.In the movie, he's a lot nicer.Susan Storm, well, she's kind of just eye-candy in the movie isn't she? An excuse to see Jessica Alba almost naked and because of that, they lacked any real development for her. It hurt the film.Johnny and Ben are by far the best and truest to the comics, but then they are also the most entertaining, the saviors of what would otherwise be a very boring film.Sure it was an introduction, but one that was overly bland with only small parts that were really entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
another bad over budgeted action movie from Hollywood,"I saw this movie with a friend yesterday and came out regretting spending 6.50 to see this piece of junk. The only good thing say that was good about this movie was Jessica Alba, and thats just because her looks. I kept waiting and waiting for this big action scene and final battle between the bad guy and good guy, and all you get is ONE FIVE MINUTE BATTLE. Not only that but it isn't that cool. The movie spent way to much time on the characters finding out their new abilities and only about 10 minutes with good action scenes. The acting wasn't very good either. The villain was horrible, Way miscast. If you plan on going to see a super hero movie go see batman begins, because this is pathetic. I was actually shocked to see how filled up the theater was when i went to see it. Also one thing about this movie i didn't like was how many one liners there were.

Very good summer film,"Without a doubt Fantastic Four is a very entertaining film for most ages. There are moments when it can be dark and intense for very young children and there are a handful of innuendos for the older children (a.k.a adults), but overall it is an enjoyable movie full of action, humor, and some emotion. Without giving too much away, the basic story is five people go into space to study a radioactive wave. Without warning the wave hits the ship and each person gains unique abilities. As the story progresses they learn to use their abilities together in mutual benefit against the forces of evil (played ever so well by Julian McMahon). Much like the X-Men movies there's an element of prejudice and a development of understanding as the film progresses. If you're a hardcore comic book fan who's been disappointed in the comic-based movies thus far, Fantastic Four is probably not for you. If you enjoyed the Spider-Man and X-Men movies you will not be disappointed by this film. It's definitely a summer film set on being a blockbuster though I'm not sure it has as much punch, so to speak, as Spider-Man or X-Men, but it's close. I'll be seeing it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing adaption of the classic superhero comic,"It's hardly a new or original observation to say that comic book conversions are very much a hit or miss affair. Films like Batman Begins show the better side, Elektra the worse. This film is somewhere between those two extremes.The start of these franchises are always a bit tricky, characters that have been around (in this case for more than half a century) have to quickly be conveyed to an audience that most likely know nothing about them.There is nothing fatally wrong about the film, the acting is a bit subpar for everyone except The Thing. The Doctor Doom character is rather laughable as a villain and doesn't really resemble the comic villain at all - and despite being a rich billionaire with plenty to lose, he goes totally crazy.The effects are of the level you'd expect from a summer blockbuster - the Thing makeup is actually pretty impressive. The forcefields, flaming and stretching are all pretty good - although clearly CGI.The humour is actually surprisingly not awful. It won't have you rolling in the aisles but it generally illicits a smile and doesn't usually fall flat on its face.So overall, it's not too horrible but it just falls short of the mark. Probably too much empty talking and not quite enough super powered action and shabby acting. Anyway, it's not too bad and if you like comics, it's worth watching.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"4 times the excitement, 4 times the effects, 4 times the fun.","It was not as good has Batman Begins, but it was good in its own right. Taking from the Marvel comic book pages. There was a 1993 film version, which I heard was so bad it was nowhere to be found. This film was quite enjoyable, not cheap at all, and I believe it will be everywhere on DVD, unlike the 1993 version. The film starts out when Reed Richards(Ioan Grufford) and his nice but quick tempered friend Ben Grimm(Michael Chiklis) make a plan to go up in space, with his billionaire old friend Victor Von Doom(Juilan McMahon), and scientist, and Reeds ex-girlfriend Sue Richards(Jessica Alba) and her hotheaded younger brother Johnny(Chris Evans) come along for the ride. But they soon have an accident in space when they all get hit with cosmic rays. And they come back to earth with different super-powers. Reed: can flex farther then normal. Sue: can turn invisible and make force fields. Ben: turns into a rock like creature with incredible strength, and can not be hurt. Johnny: can turn into flames, and fly.

Nothing new or original,"Just saw this last night at an advanced screening. It's kind of a cheesy movie but does have some nice special effects and really funny moments. If you seen the barrage of comic-book movies lately you won't find much of anything that's original or particularly different in this one. Chris Evans and Jessica Alba really shine in this movie. Chris because he's got great comedic timing and you can tell is really having fun with his. Jessica because she's hot (her acting at times left much to be desired). Michael Chiklis also is exceptional as Ben Grims/THE THING. However Ioan Gruffudd was I think miscast, as Mr. Fantastic, he's acting is way to stiff and boring for this exciting of a movie and I don't think anyone will believe his romance with Jessica Alba in a million years.All in all Fantastic Four was entertaining and if for nothing else it's worth going to see Jessica Alba.

Fantastic FAILURE,"Being a comic book fan, I truly wanted to give this movie a chance to be good. It failed...in several ways. The casting was bad, as only Chris Evans (Human Torch) and Michael Chiklis (The Thing) actually seemed the least bit believable as their characters. The poor acting, I tried hard to blame on the actors not knowing the characters well. But by the middle of the movie, it was obvious that the screenwriter was completely to blame. I saw this movie less than an hour ago, I can not for the life of me think of ONE good line of dialogue, ONE memorable scene, aside from Ben Grimm's famous ""It's Clobberin' Time!"" catch phrase. The writing is not just bad, it's VERY bad. So bad, that they even had to resort to using foul language just for shock value. I'm not saying ""Oh, mercy, they cussed, that's bad."" What I'm saying is the foul language used seemed to have just been thrown in, with no real thought on WHY the character would say such a word in that scene, yet use far more tame language in a scene you would think DESERVED foul language. The flow of the movie is lobsided, and has the most uneven flow of humor and drama I can recall ever seeing in a movie. Johnny/The Human Torch is about the only realistic character in this whole film. He behaves pretty much as one would expect an egotistical dude who now has superpowers would behave. Yet they even screw THAT up by making him suddenly mature and a team player, OUT OF THE BLUE. If they had put in just ONE 20-30 scene showing the ramifications of his behavior, that would have at least been SOMETHING for me to accept as the reason for his sudden behavior change. But, they didn't, so now they give me NOTHING I can compliment.It makes attempts to portray what life would be like for these heroes, if they really existed. Which is fine. But it's like they touch on it briefly, and apparently the problem never seems to arise again! Like how the public might react if they saw one of them in regular clothes out in public. There's ONE 30 second scene of such an incident, then it seems like the public never even notices who they are in street clothes again!But by far, the biggest complaint that I have, is the ENTIRE character of Victor Von Doom. Not one single aspect of that character in this movie was believable. And it's not Julian McMahon's fault one bit. He did a great job of trying to turn crap into gold in his performance. The writing, again, failed him, as it failed the entire movie.For the love of sanity, and your hard earned money, see another movie instead of this one.

But a pleasant surprise was this years Batman Begins which is the best comic-based movie to date and in a league of its own. Fantastic Four is for teenagers and I can't honestly picture in my head a 25-year old actually enjoying this film.

For the love of basketball see something else!,"Basic necessities in adapting any story like the F4 to the screen would be writers, directors, actors, an effects team and a healthy budget. With a cost hovering around $100 million dollars, Fantastic Four has only the budget of a successful adaptation. Enron stock would have been a better investment. With no sense of pacing, lame attempts at humor, bad effects, poor dialog, hackwork photography and some truly terrible acting F4 is a strong candidate for worst film of the year in any year, except perhaps 2000, the year of Battlefield Earth.What's wrong with this film could be related in real time by simply describing what is on the screen at any given moment. The single moment of joy in the entire ordeal was a cameo by Stan Lee. His face time was not anything spectacular but it reminded me, however briefly, of other Marvel adaptations that I 'd seen, each superior to this one. But soon it was back to Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic. His performance alone would be enough to pan the film. It's so terrible it should be called something other than acting. Frankly given how terrible all the cast (except the extras, all of whom do competent extra work) do at ""acting"" it's surprising he can stick out.123 minutes of a shiny thing without a soul would be the most appropriate title for this debacle. After last year's Taxi, perhaps it was unreasonable to expect Tim Story to put a remotely competent film on screen. True to that there is no craft here, not even a polished sheen to gloss over the omnipresent flaws.

A worthwhile Comic-book movie,"I just returned from seeing the movie, and I must say, it certainly was not as bad as I've heard it was. The acting came out rather flat at times, and the end isn't as spectacular as I'd hoped given the rest of the film.Overall, this is an origin story, and does a good job of setting up the characters' personalities and the ""family drama"" that is inherent in the Fantastic Four comics. I would have liked a little more action, I suppose, but I'm satisfied with what I've seen and am hopeful for the inevitable sequel. If you really know the characters and story, you will understand why they weren't quite as fleshed out as they are now in the comics, since this is very early on in the whole story.I might have given the movie a higher score if Jessica Alba could have acted more like Sue Storm and not someone else (Susan Storm is supposed to be a little more modest. I also sometimes wondered if she put her makeup on with a spatula). The movie fell short of fantastic, but was a fun view nonetheless. I loved Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing, and everyone else more or less got the characters down pretty well. A Good film, but not a Great one.

The lameness of the acting overshadowed by plot-holes,"Being somewhat of a Jessica Alba fan from her 'Dark Angel' days, I was willing to see what sounded like a pretty lame comic book adaptation. However, my original suspicions proved to be correct, as this movie was possibly the lamest, stupid, plot-hole ridden crap fest that has ever been forced upon unsuspecting audiences by money-hungry soul-less Hollywood studios.After the formal recognition of both 'Daredevil' and 'Catwoman' as incredibly crap movies, you would think that the corporations would finally get the idea and start introducing QUALITY to their movies rather than continuing with this kind of C-class vomit provocation.What little story that was offered between the endless low-quality special effects was both boring and unbelievable (although I realise reality wasn't exactly the objective here). The acting was generic, wooden, special mention given to Chris Evans or 'Johnny Storm', for his incredibly bad acting. You have to give him credit for making the others all seem like potential Oscar winners as he stumbled his way through this 'film'.No doubt, as it will make a profit from bored teenage boys and 40 year old virgins still living with their moms, a sequel will be released.

Worst Blockbuster of the summer,"This was the worst movie I have seen to date this summer I don't even think that better acting could have saved it. This script was lethargic and pointless, the climax was all of 10 seconds and the world was not threatened in anyway shape or form. The acting from the actor that played Mr. Fantastic couldn't have been worse or any farther away from the comic book persona. I was surprised by this movie I wanted it to be good but it let me down. There were however, some OK parts to the movie. For example, the human torch was sometimes witty and interesting, and the special effects were OK. This was just another example of a crappy movie that was made to cash in on the big bucks that superhero movies like Spider-man and X-men 1 and 2 have done. For the love of Marvel I hope X-men 3 and Ironman are better then this.Please excuse any spelling errors",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A really good superhero movie with some flaws,"The fantastic four might be an interesting movie to try to write a review for. Starters there are a lot of problems with the movie. Some of them include things like The Thing and his story arc and how the villain was handle. It ruins the characters and why they are what they are. But on the other hand there are things that are great like how they got their team name, how each person got their superhero name, Johnny's arc, and the fight scenes. I can see why people hate this movie because the problems do destroy the main gimmick of certain characters and why they are the way they are but I can understand why they did that. They wanted to semi move away from the comics and be its own take on it. And it does work in a lot of areas but in some areas it doesn't. If it was given a bit more time it could've helped make more people like the movie but because it didn't have more time we got a lot of people giving it low scores. In conclusion, there are problems with characters and their arcs but if you don't notice that then it's a really good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just Fantastic,"I would like to start out by saying, I went in to this movie with the biggest doubts I have ever had, not only because of the horrible movie released in 1994, but because lately Marvels movies have been slipping. I hated Daredevil, Electra and Hulk, I hated Hulk more than anything on Earth.Any way, within the first ten minutes my doubts were destroyed. This movie was more than ""Fantastic"". The casting in this movie was very well done, most of the CGI was great, and the inside jokes that were made between the characters helped to make this more of a movie for comic book fans than just another action movie for ""the normals"". The relationship between Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm was almost right out of the pages of the comic, and the interaction between Reed Richards and Sue Storm was well developed as well.I felt Doom could have stood to be a little more intimidating, but Julian McMahon still did a terrific job. My other gripes are that the CGI used for Reed Richards seemed rushed and looked way to fake. Everything else in this movie looked so good that if you opened your mind to the realm of comic books it was believable, yet Reed's arm, especially in the scene where he reaches under the door, just looks dumb. My other complaint was that it was nothing more than an origin story. Both Spiderman and X-Men had character origins, but they fit in so much more, but this movie was all origin with a small fight at the end. Honestly, it seemed that they still had some fleshing out to do and may drag the origin into the second film.At any rate, this film was very good and joins Spiderman X- Men and the Punisher in the plus column of Marvel films for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Four morph into a big fat bore,"Remember the Four from comic books, and the cool powers they had? The only power exerted by this cast is as a tranquilizer to the audience.Quite bad. A few scenes from other superhero movies are recycled, and poorly. No tension, drama, or even comedy, just some exaggerated CGI images. The group respond to their developing abilities like spoiled children throwing temper tantrums. They resent each other, then suddenly adapt to teamwork; who could have possibly seen that original plot device coming?Apparently, the radiation that mutated their genes, not only gave them super powers, but also the acting talents of card board cut-outs. The guy playing Doom belongs in a ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"" commercial. If he had more mousse in his hair, he'd catch on fire from spontaneous combustion. Speaking of which, the Human Torch guy is just plain irritating, and never shuts up. I kept hoping he'd fry his own mouth, but no such luck. Jessice Alba does no acting at all, just the inevitable ""Invisible Girl re-materializing at an embarrassing moment"" bit. The guy playing Mr. Fantastic tries, but the idiotic things they do with his character make him look more like a used wad of ""Mr. Chewing Gum Stick."" The only actor that succeeds is Michael Chiklis portraying Ben/ Thing's struggles with his freakish mutation. The sub plot with Ben and his wife is as close to a story as you'll get, but even that is thinly scripted.The finale is so poorly executed you'd swear it must be intended as a parody, but even on that level, it fails. Pretty much like the whole movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Enjoyable, effects-driven summer fare but surprisingly lazy","Reed Richards wants to investigate the effects of a space storm that he believes could have started life on Earth, However, out of cash he is forced to turn to Victor Von Doom, a wealthy businessman, for funding. Soon the team is altogether and on Doom's space station  Richards (the scientist), Doom (the money), Grimm (the co-pilot), Johnny Storm (the pilot) and Sue Storm (a young woman with a nice body). However it all goes wrong when the storm arrives nine hours early and only Doom can get safely behind the shields. Back on Earth, the effects of the storm start to kick in, giving the four of them amazing powers. However while they try to work out what is happening, Doom's company is collapsing, driving him into anger and rejection, while other smaller changes start to kick in on him too.Another summer, another comic book adaptation looking to kick off a franchise of blockbusters. In this regard it is no different than all the other ones; driven by special effects and noise rather than having a real depth or individualism to make it stick in the mind. These problems are obvious from the very start but it probably won't matter to those who have come for the effects because it is noisy and colourful but I was surprised by how little effort the film actually made at times. The plot is fairly straightforward but yet it also manages to be lazy at the same time  characters conveniently arrive when required and it is all too simple. In many other areas as well, it appears that the film already knows that it will get a sequel so it doesn't need to do anything special. The action is good despite being a little too sparse and simple; its quite fun and the effects are mostly good.The cast are mixed and are a surprising mix of TV stars considering the high profile of the film. Gruffudd is OK but it is hard to get behind him as a person because he doesn't have much in the way of screen presence  he is meant to be the lead but instead he is the least of the group. Alba is cutting out a risky career path for herself here  blazing a trail as a bland, pretty blonde starlet  will the trend catch on in Hollywood I wonder? She is dull as dishwater here with a poor delivery that no amount of cleavage shots can compensate for. Thank god then for Chiklis and Evans. Chiklis gets the closest to a scarred character the script gives anyone and his tough comedy and good presence is always welcome. Evans may be pretty obvious with his surfer humour but he is at least lively next to the corpses that are Gruffudd and Alba. McMahon is a bit hammy and not as much of a super-villain as I think he needed to be.Overall this is an OK summer movie but it is certainly no more than that. The effects are good and the action is fun if sparse. However the performances are surprisingly poor in key roles while the writing (in regards plotting and dialogue) leaves a lot to be desired. Not a bad film and will please target audience but it has certainly not done anything to deserve the sequel it clearly sees as its birthright.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic is one thing it most certainly isn't,"I think I liked this movie more because I had no expectation whatsoever, which is good because, had I had any, it would not have lived up to them. The characters, even the fun, wise-cracking Johnny, were more like cardboard cut-outs than actual fleshed-out characters. You had the tough/smart babe (Jessica Alba) the brilliant yet awful at relationships scientist (Ioan Gruffud) the take-nothing-seriously-yet-become-a-hero-in-the-end wise-cracker (Chris Evans, and lastly the only decent character, the man who becomes twisted and must live with his deformity and learn to embrace his power (Michael Chiklis).However, after acknowledging this, I could actually sit back and moderately enjoy the movie. The first half-hour was the best, then it got a bit tedious while we waited for the clobbering to start, then it started and, after it kept clobbering for the entire last half-hour of the movie, it was quite tiring.I like it a lot better in retrospect than I did immediately after, but it is no classic. Then again, you could do a lot worse, take Hulk for example.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
every positive review here is a studio plant,"sorry to say, but every positive review here is a studio plant. thanks for telling us that its better that doom isn't the ruler of Latveria, because it wouldn't work with an origin story, what hooey. making doom a simple industrialist, diminishes the character. oh and don't worry, their wont be a sequel...story and France have seen to that with their inept script and direction. oh and taking the ultimate ff story line, and putting it in this movie is the ultimate of stupidities. combining dooms and the ff origin stories may save time, but again, it takes away from the nuance of character development that was famous in the Kirby/lee original. the effects are pedestrian, the pacing is bad, the music is awful, the acting is atrocious what can i say but....thanks for messing up another of marvels great characters (or should i say 5 characters) another one joins the pile with the punisher and the hulk",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mcmahon and Chiklis rocked,"I have to say that the movie was good. I admit there are some flaws that many people would have noticed including the acting. Gruffold as Mr. Fantastic tries to keep steady with his role as the famous leader especially being overly analytic with Science. Alba on the other hand tried but not that well because The Invisible Woman is the one who keeps the team balanced and getting along but ends up being the woman stripping naked in order to get through the crowd. Evans, MY GOD, the Human Torch is known to be a hot head but this guy was a hot head either way, stubborn and stupid. CHiklis did a great job acting as the THing because he showed that being ugly as he is was not easy because heroes come with different looks. McMahon also did a great job being the scheming and very manipulative villain whose intentions are to gain more power. I thought it was good because of the action and the way the whole cast bonds but the way ends was bad enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Oh Grufford , how could you...","I caught this on TV tonight and couldn't finish it because I felt so bad for Ioan Grufford as Mr Fantastic. He is a fine Welsh actor I last saw in King Arthur and in this terrible movie he tries to speak without his usual accent and fumbles miserably.What a dismal excuse for a movie. The acting (yes, Grufford included) was just awful especially Julian McMahon as the villain and Jessica Alba although a truly lovely girl is still trying to be an actress.Did this really do well at the box office? Must be a lot of teen age boys out there in love with Ms Alba! Gave it a 2 because I felt so bad for Ioan Grufford who obviously is embarrassed about being in this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No. 2 Movie in the Genre,"I have to admit that when I went to go see this movie I was expecting War of the Worlds like suckiness. Tons of hype before the film comes out usually equates to doo doo on the screen, but not the case here. And FYI, this movie is nothing like The Incredibles. Fantastic Four may not be as ""Fantastic"" as some of the reviewers- who I suspect have been paid by the studio to post here- claim it is, but it is definitely not a bad film...and it certainly is better than some other films of the superhero genre. I look forward to seeing what else they do with this series, since the book it is based on was a comic book staple (get it...staple) for so many kids. I'm sure if it does well at the box office this year, we'll be seeing another one in about 9 months or so.If I had to rank this film it would probably come in 2nd behind the Spiderman series. Arguably the X-men series could also be considered 2nd, it's safe to say the two are tied for the silver medal. The Incredibles was a good movie too, but it's more of a homage to superhero's then a true superhero film. Just to give you my frame of reference here's what I think about some other superhero movies, with the exception of Batman, Batman Returns, &Batman Begins that entire series is garbage. The Blade series was very cool, but not for everyone. Daredevil was too true to the comic book and, as was the case with the book, didn't appeal to most audiences either...but I liked it. Elektra was just awful. The original Superman movies are classics and I love'em. The Hulk was bad...but not as bad as Elektra. Hope that gives you an idea of my perspective.Digressing back to the subject, this movie is worth the cash. Go see it if you like Superhero movies or are a comic book fan like me. But if you just want a good action flick you might want to pass. However, There are some decent action sequences so you definitely wouldn't be bored, like I found myself being throughout WOTW. And it's not as dark as Batman Begins, so you can bring the kids if you have'em. All in all, decent summer popcorn flick. Not incredible, or stupendous, just a little fantastic (ok, so that wasn't funny either...sue me).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's not horrible, but it's far from fantastic","Fantastic Four's stench is nowhere near as rancid as that of Catwoman, Elektra, or Daredevil, but it's really not all that fresh, and I don't know if back-handed compliments like that are really what the movie was shooting for. But hey, looking at the reviews it's getting I think it should take what it can get.The movie is actually a little more entertaining than I thought it would be, but my expectations were lower than a Star Trek fan's on prom night, so that's not saying a lot. Yes, it provides a few laughs, and it didn't send me into the stupor that Daredevil did, but there just isn't anything at all about the movie that stands out. I can't pinpoint a specific thing about it that impressed me.Shouldn't I be impressed on at least a small level? Am I supposed to be bowled over by Jessica Alba turning invisible? Yeah, Claude Rains did it in an equally convincing fashion in 1933. Oh, I know, how about The Thing? He's a big rock dude who should be able to do massive amounts of damage! Weeeeell, unfortunately his foam rubber costume looks ridiculous. I know Chiklis fought hard against using CGI because he wanted to bring the human element to the character, but he apparently forgot about the ""laugh out loud at how ridiculously fake the costume looks"" element. Chiklis does a pretty good job, but come on. The main problem with the character is that he spends most his time either lamenting his condition or being cute. Yeah, you're a big rock, wah, get over it and DO SOMETHING! And could someone please tell me who thought Ioan Gruffudd would make a good Richard Reed? This guy is supposed to be the leader of the group? I guess he was close to being a convincing leader. All he lacked was charisma, intensity, toughness, charm, emotion, and courage. Other than that... It also didn't help that most the scenes where he was using his stretching ability looked like they came straight out of Looney Tunes.At least they had a really cool bad guy, right? Surely you can't go wrong with Dr. Doom! Apparently you can if Dr. Doom is in the hands of the guy who directed Taxi. Dr. Doom spends the entire movie looking like an older Kerr Smith from Dawson's Creek, and then we get about 10 minutes of him in the mask? Wow, thanks. And after the transformation he really isn't all the menacing or threatening. He sounds like he's talking in a subway tunnel. Plus, his anger is understandable.The guy has his entire business and livelihood stripped away from him, so naturally he's gonna be pretty ticked off. Then the Fantastic Four get all the praise and glory for their new super powers? Bitter? Yeah, I think he might be. He loses everything while they all become heroes. Let's face it, somebody with the name of Victor Von Doom is destined to be a bad guy, there's really no way around that, so it would've been nice if he'd actually had an edge to him. Where's the darkness? I'm more scared of Christian Bale as Batman, and he's a good guy! Doom comes off as a bad guy for 6-year-olds to not be too scared of.Another nitpick complaint is since this is supposed to be an origin movie, why aren't we given an explanation as to why each person got the specific super powers he or she did? It's barely hinted at that the powers reflect the personalities of each person, but why exactly does Jessica Alba gain the power of invisibility? Are they trying to claim she has transparent acting ability? Speaking of which, she sure looks good in her Fantastic Four outfit, but where is the emotion? Where is the conviction? I know she wasn't given much to work with, but put a little power in your line delivery! This certainly didn't help fuel the romantic angle between her and Dr. Reed. Whew, that didn't pan out, now did it? I saw more spark in my 10-year-old brother's eye when he watched Dakota Fanning in Uptown Girls than I did between these two. You'd think two scientists would know at least a little something about chemistry. *rim shot* Thank you, thank you.I do have to give Chris Evans some credit though. He actually seemed to be having fun with the role, and his character actually has a personality. While the others were whining and moaning about their new, cool super powers, he was genuinely excited about it. That's how I'd be. I'd just shrug my shoulders, ask myself how much fame and money I could make off my little DNA alteration, and run with it.But let's be honest, we all have to admit that the words, ""Wow, Chris Evans really carried the movie,"" don't speak well for the movie as a whole.As a superhero movie, this just isn't that good, folks. The best way for me to describe Fantastic Four is that it felt like a pilot for a TV show. As a ""Chris Evans at the Apollo"" showcase it works, but as a comic book translation? Nah. It comes off as more of a ""sitcomic book translation."" BA DA BING! Man, I'm just full of 'em today.Let me leave you with a public service announcement: if you're a Fantastic Four fanboy, and you end up really enjoying this movie, then I'm truly happy for you. But please, under no circumstances ever refer to this as ""funtastic."" You deserve to be punched if you do.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Decent Comic Book of a Movie,"I had the fortune of attending an advance screening of F4 and left the theater with a smile. Like many comic book movies it suffers from the pacing problem inherent in telling an origin story AND an adventure story. The origin story will be well-known (and therefore painfully dull) to a portion of the audience {even with the changes they made for the movie} but necessary for that part of the audience that is unfamiliar with the material.This movie is one of the best adaptations of a comic book to movie. The actors are perfectly cast, for the most part. Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans were particularly great in their roles as The Thing and the Human Torch. Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffud and Julian McMahon made less of an impression as there roles were not as 'flashy' as the others. {SPOILERs follow} Which leads to the main problem of the film: Dr. Doom is almost a non-entity. In most of the scenes he appears in it is not clear as to what drives him other than that he is supposed to be the villain. The implication is that he is angry at Reed Richards for damaging his business and stealing Sue but you never understand why this would drive him to murder and destruction. I guess you are supposed to think that ""he is the villain"" and is supposed to go to these extremes. Was he crazy/evil to begin with? Did the accident affect his mind? Compare and contrast with the villains in the Spider-Man and X-Men movies. Or Batman Begins. {This is also undermined by the weakness of the love triangle subplot.}But, by the time he finally goes into full villain mode, the movie is almost over. Then it ends. Just when it got really interesting and revved up to full speed. {SPOILERS end} It is still a joy for any fans of the comic to see it on the big screen. Non-fans may not have as good a time. Its a comic book movie, people! If you go into it with the same expectations you would a comic (not graphic novel!)you will definitely enjoy yourself. It certainly takes a different path than Batman Begins in following comic book conventions and adapting them to film rather than using film conventions to tell a comic book story, if you can grasp the difference.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Decent but most of the time it felt like more of a comedy,"Fantastic FourStarring: Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis and Juilan McMahonGenre: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi/FantasyRated PG-13Fantastic Four is a pretty good movie but the X-Men and Spider-Man movies are a little better but this was better than The Hulk. I did like The Hulk but I still think that movie needed improvement. This movie is based on another well known Marvel comic book about 5 astronauts who go on a space mission and later get caught in a cosmic radiation exposure and they gain superpowers. But only 4 out of the 5 people used their powers to save the world and they are Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), The Invisible Woman/Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), The Human Torch/Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and The Thing/Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who become the Fantastic Four! But for Victor Von Doom (Juilan McMahon) he uses his powers for evil and destruction when he loses his company and everything else and becomes Dr. Doom! I think this movie could have been a little longer and I think there could have been some more fight scenes and such. But the story of this movie went too fast like X-Men but all and all it was alright. I was glad to see Jessica Alba back on screen again in this movie and her movie before this one, Sin City, because I haven't seen her ever since ""Dark Angel"" got canceled off FOX. Plus I'm glad in this movie, they didn't CGI-ed The Thing because that would have been stupid if they did. Before this movie came out in theaters, Jessica Alba already said that there is going to be a sequel to this movie! Decent overall.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Entertaining comic book fare...but not much more,"I've never been a fan of comic books (never really read one, to be honest); but I do like a good comic book film. The recent ones have mostly been very good - Spider-Man 2 and Batman Begins both being great examples of how well comics can translate to the big screen. Fantastic Four has a reputation for being one of the better comic books - given that it's central quartet are reminiscent of a family structure, and how you get four characters instead of the usual one; but despite all that, this movie just isn't as great as I've come to expect this sort of film to be. Probably the main reason for this is that the film puts the focus almost completely on entertainment value, and so it lacks that dark, foreboding element that has made the likes of Batman and Spider-Man such a joy. Not that comic book films need to be dark - quite the opposite, but we never get a look inside the characters either. The Thing is the one who receives the best handling, but aside from a decent expose of how his affliction affects his personal life, we don't get much of his actual character either.The plot follows a crew of five astronauts who find themselves in the centre of a radiation cloud during a botched mission, and upon return to Earth, find that the radiation has altered their DNA. Four of the five decide to use their power for good, while the fifth goes the other way. The Fantastic Four comprises of The Human Torch; with fire as his power, The Invisible Girl (goes without saying), the rubbery Mr Fantastic and the unfortunate member of the gang - the monstrous 'Thing', who gains great strength to compliment his ugly form. On the whole, I would say that the cast is too young. Michael Chiklis is well cast as The Thing, but Mr Fantastic, for example, could have done with an older actor, who would have brought out his leadership qualities better. The villain, Victor Von Doom is the biggest casting mistake. Julian McMahon, the actor in said role, does look sufficiently menacing - but an older man would have made a far more convincing villain. I noticed that Tim Robbins was considered for the role - I would like to have seen that. The fact that all five of the lead roles have gone to young men and a woman just stinks of a ploy to get more teenagers into the cinema. Anyway, this film is entertaining enough; and I certainly don't dislike it - but unlike some of the better comic book films; entertainment is all Fantastic Four is.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Flame On!!!,"I have to say I enjoyed watching this movie even though it was not the action packed, special effects laden, vehicle I thought it would be. The special effects that are present are good if not plenty. The story deals with how these four people ( actually Five if you count Dr. Doom) all come to terms with their new found powers and how they try to cope with the notoriety of it all as well. Be Grimm's struggle is dealt with in a little more detail than the others. The writing is fun and light and doesn't take itself too seriously. The Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm's scenes are some of the best. The best action sequence, which occurs on a bridge with all four characters involved, also is done all in fun. The actors, I felt, are all perfectly cast and I have to say Jessica Alba is one of the most beautiful women I have ever scene and she looks ""Fantastic"" on the big screen. Saying all this its not to say that the movie doesn't have some flaws. The biggest one for me is why the government, FBI, etc... never show up to question, study, etc....these now mutated folks. This could have been a more interesting tale. In final, To me it was like getting to watch a real good TV movie on the big screen because it was written almost as such. And thats not saying its such a bad thing. Again, I enjoyed myself. Viewers can just accept this as a fun introduction to the foursome and should expect the sequel to really deliver the goods as far as special effects and action are concerned....Now lets just hope they do a sequel...with the opening being tallied around 56 million...I think its safe to say a sequel is not far behind.

It doesn't get much worse.,"Well, I've seen the Fantastic Four. And it is terrible. As in not fantastic at all. Allow me to explain what I'm talking about: After being persuaded to go see it with a friend of mine, we went to go see it. I was already hesitant, as I figured from the trailer, I've probably seen the best parts of the movie, and I'm wasting money. Well, the first hour or so of the movie at first I thought, was strangely OK. They get their powers, and start studying them. I found the one part of how they had to cope with living together even funny. The development of the villain, Dr. Doom, was bad. They should've just used Willem Dafoe's character from the first Spiderman. I'm not kidding. Just take the footage from Spiderman, and place it in. The same circumstances of why he becomes evil and all of that are practically identical. However, at around the hour marker, the fire alarm went off, and the two of us were forced to leave the theater. I should've taken that as a sign. A few days later, with a free ticket in hand (thanks to the false alarm), I went back to see it a second time. The first hour was OK at best again. However, with almost brutal accuracy, I predicted the ending down to the smallest detail, and I was only halfway done with the film. I began to realize the pointlessness of the conflict between our heroes and the villain, the lack of development, the lack of story, the lack of purpose. The dialogue was dry. And the ending was exactly as I expected, only far shorter and anticlimactic to the most unbearable you can imagine. You will leave this movie either disappointed, or you will be too dazed from its stupidity to realize you just witnessed something terrible. I hate this movie. It's SO bad. And if you don't believe me... well, maybe you should just this time. I wouldn't want to punish you with seeing it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Nutshell Review: Fantastic Four,"OK, I admit I've always been a closet Fantastic Four fan. Before Stan Lee created the better known Spider-man, Hulk, X-Men, he created Fantastic Four, touted as the World's Greatest Comics Magazine, back in the 60s. Reed Richards is Mr Fantastic, Sue Storm/Richards is The Invisible Girl, her brother Johnny Storm is The Human Torch, and Richard's best friend / one time Sue's ex is Ben Grimm, aka The Thing.This is not the first time that the origin has been recreated in film (the first one being a desperate attempt to secure movie rights, and is a tacky B-production), but this is the version that's done so right.And I dare say this is the BEST Marvel comic book adaptation ever, staying very true to its characterization just as Stan Lee envisioned it to be. Classic touches include the bickering amongst the characters and of course the very cliché (perhaps FF popularized it?) basic plot of cooperation and teaming is stronger than the individual. The spot-on rivalry between Johnny and Ben, the use of their powers on one another (always liked it when Richards overpower Ben), and the costumes themselves serve a purpose, highlighting the Invisible Girl's curves... oops, I mean the suits being exposed to the same radiation and adapting the same properties as its wearer, and Ben's fedora and brown trench-coat looked so in place.I could go on, like Richard's vow to Ben to help his tragic friend (and themselves) reverse the effects on their DNA, his overworking in their penthouse headquarters of the Baxter Building, the rejection of The Thing's appearance by the public, Johnny's impulsiveness and crave for popularity, and Sue's peacemaker role amongst the boys. What I also liked is that this film takes its time to develop their arch-nemesis Victor Von Doom, as his transformation takes place throughout the movie until the finale.Compared to Spider-man, there isn't a sappy romance to slow things down (and Mary J Watson was never Peter Parker's first!), nor are there too many heroes and villains like X-Men such that each character has limited screen time because of the focus on its most popular character Wolverine. In this film, each character has their own adequate share of the limelight, though I must mention that the Human Torch outshone the rest in set action pieces, while The Thing stole the show with humour. The film doesn't seem too long (about the same duration as the original X-Men), but it manages to pack all the action, emotion, backstory nicely as one summer flick.Kudos to the casting team in bringing together actors who look the role too. Although 3 out of 5 stars are more goggle box actors (Alba, McMahon, Chilklis), they sure looked comfortable in their outing on the big screen.If two's a company, and three's a crowd, then Four's just FANtastic! Looking at box office numbers, I don't think it'll outdo Spider-man, but I'm still game for a sequel - they can bring on Galactus for all I care! Look out for the cameo appearance of Stan Lee, whom you always expect in a Marvel adaptation that meets expectations!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Movie!,"I was really looking forward to see this movie. Even more so because WOTW disappointed me last week. And F4 didn't disappoint me at all! It was great! The characters are awesome. The best part of the movie for me is the humor of the human torch...I think he's what makes the movie so good. The acting is really well done by all. I also really liked how they each reacted to their new self. What happens with the thing is really sad at parts and very emotional and it's well put in the movie. The special effects are wonderful. Oh, the only thing I didn't really appreciate is the fact that it ended so quickly. It was really too easy to kill Victor...I think it took about 2 minutes max...I was expecting a big final showdown but it went so quickly. Anyway, all in all it was awesome! Go see it!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
As Bad As It gets,"It'll be torture to have to write 600 words about a movie that can be summed up in 50: it's as mediocre as they come.The acting in this movie is average - or below that. Jessica Alba has 3 expressions: petulance, annoyance, surprise. That's her entire range.If the actual Fantastic Four existed, and saw this movie, Reed Richards would create an inter-dimensional portal and move there.Chris Evans is okay, but much better - and more noble - as Captain America. Ionic gruffuld is also one dimensional and his subsequent series did not reveal any hidden depths.Dr. Doom is not remotely the Dr. Doom of the comic books; he's just a mean-spirited guy. (And I've read them since issue 1.) The REAL Dr Doom was an utterly evil psychopath.Oh, thank God! I've met the minimum character limit. Not wasting another charact...",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining enough,"There is something in 'Fantastic Four' I have been waiting for: a superhero who thinks his superpowers are really cool, even calling his new fitting suit a ""costume"". I know that Robin from 'Batman Forever' had the same thought, but he had no superpowers, just a lot of gadgets, a mask and a cape. Some x-men maybe shared the thought as well, but the negativity against mutants made it different there. So, back to 'Fantastic Four' and the reason I bring this little thing up at the start of this review. Although this may not be a flawless entry in the superhero-genre, it is one that has some new ideas. Together with entertaining characters and story, some humor and nice visual effects what can go wrong in a superhero movie?Nothing really, as 'Fantastic Four' proves. As did 'Blade', 'X-Men', 'Spider-Man', 'Hellboy' and even 'Daredevil'. These films are not flawless but made in the right way, finding out not only how to work as a comic book but also as a movie. 'Blade', 'X-Men' and 'Spider-Man' all got sequels that were better, showing they had learned. For a first film 'Fantastic Four' brings the right stuff, for its sequel it has to improve. But that's for later.The story centers around four heroes all with their own power, which they got from radiation while being in outer space. I spare you the details. The leader is Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) who is elastic. His love interest is Sue (Jessica Alba), the invisible girl with some extra powers. Her brother is Johnny (Chris Evans), who can turn into a fireball. Last but not least there is Ben (Michael Chiklis) who has turned into a man made out of rock. He is the muscles from the group. The villain is Doom, once named Victor Von Doom (Julian McMhaon), once lover of Sue, also infected with the radiation. I guess that is all you need to know.The powers and villain are interesting enough to keep our attention while the human story behind the heroes makes it more interesting than it could have been. I could have done without the love story between Reed and Sua, but you simply got to have it these days. Near the end the film is rushing a little, but they took quite the time to get the story underway. To keep the movie withing the two hours it seems like a wise decision. Further than these things I have little complaints, especially considering this is the first 'Fantastic Four'-effort. If the characters develop and the humor stays the same, we might have something here when the sequel arrives.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not quite Fantastic,"After several stellar comic book adaptations from Marvel Comics stock of superhero superstars (X-Men, Spider-Man), we are finally, unfortunately, treated to a mediocre entry for one of their A-List, Fantastic Four. The big-budget adaptation of Fantastic Four is lackluster at best, proving to be a slightly diverting, but not tremendously entertaining, adventure.As with most other comic book adaptations, we are treated to an ""origin"" story for the Fantastic Four. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud), a brilliant but bankrupt scientist, along with his friend Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), have approached rich industrialist Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon, of Nip/Tuck fame) to fund an expedition to his private space station to perform research on a cosmic radiation cloud that might prove to reveal some information about human evolution. Von Doom agrees, although he demands that he keep most of the profit from any financial gains that the mission might hold. He brings along his assistant, Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), a former love interest of Reed's, and her brother, hothead Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), who is the mission pilot. Shortly after arriving at the space station, it turns out that the calculations about the storm's trajectory are off, and it arrives earlier than planned, bathing the crew in radiation.Upon returning from space everyone appears to be unaffected at first, but shortly thereafter, they begin exhibiting some strange symptoms, and each quickly discovers they have been granted a unique ability from the storm. Reed can stretch his body like a rubber band, Sue can become invisible, Johnny can immolate himself and fly and Ben transforms into a giant made of rock. Von Doom, who was protected behind his station's shields, doesn't seem to have been affected at all, but his symptoms simply take longer to manifest, and he quickly realizes that his body is transforming into an organic metal that can store electricity and then return it in the form of lightning bolts. Reed determines that he must try to reverse the storm's effect on them, but not before the world is introduced to their existence thanks to an happenstance traffic accident that they are able to help out with. Thanks to this exposure, the group become media celebrities overnight and are dubbed the Fantastic Four by reporters, although some of the group meets this newfound fame with trepidation.If Fantastic Four has a key problem, it is that the members of it's group are woefully underdeveloped. Much like X-Men and X2, there are almost too many characters to adequately juggle for a two hour movie. As such, most of the group gets short-shrift. Reed comes across as a shy, socially inept geek, but we don't see much beyond that superficial exterior. Sue Storm is developed even less, she is memorable only because Jessica Alba is easy on the eyes. Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm, on the other hand, make something of an impression, even though they are also not completely fleshed out. Johnny is entertaining in a juvenile, annoying sidekick kind of way, and he provides a great deal of the film's comic relief. Ben has the most interesting plight of the four, shunned by his girlfriend because of his looks and having to deal with the most difficulty with his body (elevators won't rise, chairs and silverware break when he sits). The screenplay develops Ben best of the group. Finally, Von Doom turns out to be a bland, uninteresting villain, who is evil simply because he is narcissistic. That is a good start for a bad guy, but there is not enough meat on the bones to create much dislike for him.Aside from underdevelopment, Fantastic Four suffers from a rather limp script. The film just sort of meanders its way along, never developing much excitement or interest. For anyone looking for action, this is not the film to see. While hardly a requisite for a good movie, action scenes are well used in both Spider-Man and X-Men, but are rather wanting here. The visual effects are a mixed bag also, most being impressive, but some at times some come across cheesy and unconvincing.Acting-wise, nobody embarrasses themselves in the film, but there is little that is outstanding either. Chiklis turns in the best performance as Ben Grimm, giving the character the appropriate amount of pathos. Chris Evans is also effective as Johnny Storm. Sue and Reed are about as bland as bland come, adding little to the mix. Julian McMahon is underwhelming as Victor Von Doom, proving to not be a memorable entry in Marvel's rogues gallery of villains.In many ways, Fantastic Four is the antithesis of X-Men. Where the X-Men is an allegory for racial bigotry and the X-Men are viewed with fear, Fantastic Four are in the center of the spotlight because of their abilities. There are some interesting ideas that could be introduced with this concept, but the script doesn't do much with it, although it is nice to see the outside world react to the discovery of these unique individuals in a way that seems to be realistic for our current day and age.Overall, Fantastic Four is a very weak link in the Marvel film chain. We can only hope that the next entries for X-Men and Spider-Man don't follow suit.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Boring and stupid.,"Fantastic Four is probably the worst comic book movie to date. This sub-genre contains a lot of great films (Superman, Burton's and Nolan's Batman, Hellboy...) but this one is a true disgrace, and really gives comic books a bad name. The basic story could be turned into a great sci-fi movie for kids and adults. Think of high-concept movies like Back To The Future, or Lost in Space: whether you like them or not they're great family films, with both great effects, a good cast, and some science fiction themes tailored for the whole family. Fantastic Four got nothing: the cast is mediocre (except maybe Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis), the direction is atrocious, the script is stupid and the practical SFX worthy of a B-grade movie (the Thing costume is truly laughable, which is quite annoying since the character carries most of the dramatic moments...)If you really want to feed your kids with the dumbest mass-produced Hollywood trash, give it a try. But don't expect your kids to develop good tastes after that.BUT if you don't wanna dumb down your children with the worst kind of entertainment you could possibly find, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.My advice: rent Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" instead. It's smarter, faster and funnier.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Snoar,"This movie should be taken as a sign: to maybe rethink making every comic book franchise available into a movie. This movie really could have been something great, but it wasn't. It was very average, which makes the rest of us a lot less optimistic that these kinds of movies can continue.Everything in the movie feels like a cliché, the villain, the heroes, the situations they land in, and the ending, and that is very worrying, that after only a few years, it is all turning into a cliché.But its not all bad. Chris Evans works really well as Johnny Storm, adding humour that is not unintentional, and The Thing is equally as good, probably the most developed character in the movie, and a couple of the action scenes are exciting, but the rest of the movie feels rushed, almost as if the director/screenwriter has thought ""OK, comic book movies have these kind of moments, and this should happen"" instead of taking a stab at turning Fantastic Four into something different and original.Wasted opportunity.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ah, the Fantastic Four","I was told that this movie (if you can even call it that) is a ""good kids flick"" at best. I am a big fan of comic book films, and even if they are terrible (i.e. Daredevil, the second and third sequels of Superman and Batman), I still find some fun in their camp or reverence to comic book themes. I did not find any of these while watching the ""Fantastic Four"". Tim Story, a funny little man who impressed me with ""Barbershop"" and depressed me with the oh so not funny remake ""Taxi"" seemed to continue his downward spiral in this lost little adaptation of our beloved foursome. I couldn't help but notice the continuity errors, the mixed up science facts, the blue screen still left in shots, the terribly written dialogue which sometimes didn't make sense; it made me think, Tim Story and his puppet strings so tightly bound to the suits running this little operation , care more about the product placement in the film more than the movie itself. Now granted, every film has it's flaws, but directors with talented editors usually make this part of the fun of seeing the film, like when the color leaks outside of the frame on a comic book. But this wasn't fun; this wasn't even dealt with. Tim Story got his check, as did the rest of the half talented cast and laughed all the way to the sequel which they now have decided to destroy the myths of Silver Surfer along with the Fantastic Four. Tim Story, congratulations. You just don't care about your work, you don't care about the movies you make, and you're basically doing what every dumb American kid raised on bad Saturday morning cartoons, pop rocks and Jolt cola would do if they never grew up. Good luck ruining Silver Surfer for everyone who ever liked him. And after this franchise ends and no one shows up to see Barbershop 3; take a little advice....GROW THE HELL UP AND DIRECT A MOVIE LIKE A BIG BOY!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Definitely worth seeing,"To enjoy this movie, as I did, I think it helps to go in with some idea of what the movie is meant to be. Unlike DC, Marvel has not had a string of shitty movies to make up for: with movies like Spiderman 2 and X2 fresh in memories, they can afford to make the occasional light-hearted, fun money maker. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie, but it is pretty much intended to make money and not much else. There isn't a serious attempt at drama, only a movie meant to be entertaining. And it is entertaining. To try and make this film into something it's not is to doom it before you see it. Light on character development? By some standards, yes. But it's not meant to be a very deep movie; the only one of the four who really has to deal with a lot is Ben Grimm, and this is handled very well. It is a movie worth seeing (and there are enough comic references to make it interesting for long time fans), and there's no reason to hate it because it's not one critics would love.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stunned At How GOOD It Is!,"This movie is a true rarity this year. It's a summer movie that doesn't try and depress you in to loving it or becoming emotionally involved. Parents don't die; Jedi's aren't slaughtered nor is the earth is decimated by aliens. FF takes itself seriously but it still manages to be fun. Even minus the dark tragedy, it's bigger, badder, smarter, and definitely more fun then anything I've seen so far this summer.For those going into this flick expecting a lot of fun, prepare to enjoy-- although fun's not the only piece of this pie. In fact, I think movie fans of all ages will be stunned at how many levels this movie delivers upon. This is a smart and surprisingly funny film that really delivers.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Watchable, even enjoyable . . despite what you've read.","I made a decision to read a few online reviews before seeing this movie, and my reaction in the theater was ""wow, what a relief"" as the film is nowhere near as weak as some (pro and amateur) critics would tell you. Sure, The Torch does not ponder the possibilities of being able to incinerate the atmosphere . . but who in a Marvel comic ever would? I read the comic when I was a kid from 1974-1987, and caught up on the 'Kirby years', so I am pretty familiar with the original storyline.I enjoyed the casting / representation on screen of both The Thing and Reed Richards, I thought the casting, acting & dialog were all fine, even great!Dr Doom: okay, they changed his origin to tie him in tighter for the 2 hour storyline. I was fine with the changes (so now he's not just a crazy person with an ugly face), I thought the dialog and Julian McMahon's acting were all acceptable.Sue and Johhny Storm were another matter. I felt the movie stretched the limits of Jessica Alba's skills in interpreting the material. She is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful people in Hollywood today, but the material required more. She fared better in scenes where she had little or no dialog, just action (she seems to do fine with the physical nature of the job here). Minor quibble: she hardly looks like the Sue in the book to me. Chris Evans, the actor playing the Torch, did not look like the comic persona either. His charisma, looks and acting skills are undeniable but (compared to the comic) he seemed older and more athletic - an attempt to modernize him I suppose. He should look obviously younger than Sue (by the book), but he does not.A lot has been said about the effects in this film and (as a 12 year Photoshop user and 19 year professional artist) I think far too much negative criticism has been leveled at the film. Nothing like ""Mr. Fantastic"" has appeared on film to date that looked 100% realistic, period - and he is the only weak spot visually in the film. His comic-book is at the extreme threshold of believability, I assure you; and I think he will look fine on video. He looks at least as realistic as (the puppet) Yoda to me! All the flame, invisibility , and force field effects looked state-of-the-art, so those two are covered! I thought the Thing as portrayed ""in a suit"" rather than animated was a very good idea. He looked weightier and more subtle than Ang Lee's Hulk, so what is all the crowing about? Kudos to Michael Chilklis as well!!No one even mentioned the sets, the Baxter Building looks absolutely perfect.I sure hope that all the criticism does not kill off chances of a sequel. Spiderman 2 and X-Men 2 were better than their predecessors, and I think given the chance that the same will happen here.I also hope my boyhood idol Stan Lee is proud of the film, he has every right to be.Now, someone please release the 90's low-budget FF movie so everyone can see how good this current film is by comparison?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four Doesn't Live Up To Hype,"I just saw the movie last night, mostly because my wife was a fan of the comic books. I knew nothing of the comics, but we both left disappointed. The movie can't compare to Batman Begins, which I have seen twice.While this movie would have probably been considered a ""good"" or even ""great"" movie several years ago, it can't compare to something like Batman Begins or even Spiderman 2.I have read in other reviews that Tim Story, the director, was trying to create a film from a fan's perspective. Though not knowing the story, my wife told me he stayed pretty true to the comics, but simply made too little of a plot into too long of a movie. I didn't even fully know the plot but it just seemed that I could predict every typical good guy vs bad guy thing that was going to happen.As far as the actors reviews... well Chris Evans stole the show, I think. He added the much needed humor in the movie; his scenes being the only time I laughed. Michael Chiklis also had a few slightly humorous lines but did nothing special to make you love him, either as ""The Thing"" or as ""Ben"". Jessica Alba was simply there as a distraction, basically a pretty face. She didn't seem to know anything about science, unlike what her character in the comic books would. And as for Ioan Gruffudd, well... he tried but he just did not come across as believable. He seemed boring and did not bring too much to the Fantastic Four.I am interested in seeing what happens after the sales come out from this weekend. The cast on FOX News, said that they were already signed on for 2 and 3... but I just don't see that happening if this one does as bad as I fear it will. Happy movie going.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's Okay,"This was an okay film. It wasn't amazing but it was watch about and somewhat enjoyable. Is it memorable? No. Would I watch it again? No. But did I suffer to watch it? No.The corny lines were not bad, and the acting was fine. There just wasn't anything that really stood out throughout the entire film. The special effects for some of the characters were a little wonky but all-around okay quality. I wish I could add more or critique it better, but I really can't think of anything than ""meh"".The cinematography was boring I feel like they missed a lot of chances to use more dynamic movements with Johnny and Reed's characters.Final thoughts:Plot: 4/10 Writing: 4/10 Acting: 4/10 Special Effects: 4/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Personal Enjoyment: 3/10.Total:4/10.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Distinctly Average Four,"The Marvel Comic Book Heroes are getting snapped up by studios as quickly as they can buy them. Ever since X-Men and Spiderman proved to be huge hits for the individual companies the comic book heroes have had movies made about them y the bucket load. To date we've had Spiderman, Blade, Hulk, Daredevil, Elektra, X-Men, Ghost Rider and hundreds more are inevitably on the way. Yet it wasn't until 2005 that the original Marvel superheroes, the ones that many comic book fans hold dear to their hearts, made their baby steps onto the big screen. Of course I am speaking of the Fantastic Four, admittedly until I saw the movie I knew next to nothing about the origins and the story behind the Fantastic Four, at most I knew their names, that was all. What followed after its release was a hell of a lot of disappointed comic book fans moaning about how they didn't get certain characters right. This of course never bothered me, but still I found the Fantastic Four to be a major letdown in almost every aspect. I found it dull, cheesy, not action packed enough and too focused on everything but progressing the actual characters and story itself. The movie left me underwhelmed, yet still sort of wanting a sequel to be made due to the potential of the characters. So with the upcoming release of Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, I decided to return to the original movie and see whether it has aged any better. The simple answer is that it now seems a better movie, but its still a deeply flawed one.So let me first begin with the actual cast of the movie, namely the supposed ""fantastic"" four themselves. I suppose the two main cast members are what frustrated me most originally, Ioan Gruffud and Jessica Alba as Reed Richards and Sue Storm. Neither of them seem anything above average. Ioan Gruffud has no material to work with, which is a shame as I've seen him in some movies and he's actually a reasonably good actor. But there is no excuse for how pitiful Jessica Alba is. Despite the odd moment where she seems to be making an effort, she generally seems in a daze. Its not until later scenes that I actual began to acknowledge her character, at the start she was so bland it was unreal. Thankfully the rest of the major cast work pretty well. Chris Evans pretty much is the Human Torch, he's cocky, he's arrogant, but he's funny and he has a great personality. Chris Evans was a newcomer here and he managed to steal every sequence he was in. Michael Chiklis also is the best person to play The Thing, a shame his costume looks ludicrous at times, but the performance underneath it is pretty well done. Now is the time to mention my first change of opinion from when I original saw the movie. At first I didn't like Julian McMahon as Dr Doom, mainly because I had been lead to believe that Dr Doom is the very best super villain you will find in a comic book. So when I sat and watched the movie, and realised he'd been interpreted as this villain who was killing people, just because he lost some money and his girlfriend, left me a bit underwhelmed. However after another viewing I came to realise its not the performance that's to fault. In fact he steals pretty much the last quarter of the movie when stuff really gets going.The actual story of the Fantastic Four is my biggest fault with the film. Its just the fact that after the Four get their powers, we end up standing around for forty five minutes while nothing happens, and I seriously mean nothing happens at all! We get a fun insight into using their powers in regular life, but after that all we hear is The Thing moaning about looking ugly, Reed doing all his quantum physics talk, Johnny being an idiot by trying to be a celebrity and Sue, well Sue frowning a lot. That's it. Thankfuly the movie realises its fault in the last twenty minutes and we get a pretty well executed fight with Dr Doom. It might not be the best superhero fight, but after such a huge gap of anything action packed its nice to see something happening on screen. The opening scenes are a bit rushed, and the bit in space is horribly animated, but the actual story going on is passable for a comic book movie.The action of the movie is perhaps another one of the movies faults. When the action gets going its entertaining, generally its well executed and we get a good insight into the powers. We see this in the entertaining Brooklyn Bridge sequence, the well filmed scenes in the finale. But apart from those two scenes, there really isn't much else in terms of action. Now this might be seen as a good thing because origin stories are about how the heroes become and learn to be super. But the trouble is this movie tries to focus on entertainment, its lacking in a good script, it hardly relies on its stars to draw crowds in, all that its left to fall back on really is its cheesy humour, which admittedly at times works, and its action sequences. The lack of action sequences just becomes frustrating after a while.Anyway Fantastic Four isn't an awful movie, and I can definitely sit and re watch it without wanting to kill myself. But the movie is definitely flawed and never lives up to its full potential. I have high hopes for the sequel, the promising trailers and the fact the origin story is out of the way is always a positive. But they desperately need to do a bit more with the storyline next time.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you don't expect much, then it's a decent flick","I didn't expect much when I went into the theater, and I didn't receive much from the movie. This movie was OK. It could have been a lot better, especially after seeing Batman Begins.Plot: The plot in this movie jumps around too much. One minute they realize they have superpowers, the next they are celebrities for no apparent reason except for ""saving the day"" one time. The funny thing is that the F4 were the reason why the chaos was happening in the first place. In fact, all of the destruction that the F4 have to save was first caused by them. It feels as though they aren't saving the day, but rather fixing what they have messed up. Also, the plot has many irregularities. 1 / 5 Dialouge: The dialouge wasn't unbearable, but it wasn't that good. However, it did have some funny one-liners which I think probably made the movie a lot better. 2.5 / 5 Acting: Only Doom(McMahon) and Thing(Chiklis) do a good job acting. Even though they are giving crappy dialouge to work with, they at least do a good job with it. Alba did the worst job out of everyone. 2 / 5 Special effects: Don't expect some amazing special effects with this movie. While they aren't bad, the problem is that after seeing Revenge of the Sith, the FX in F4 look really out-dated. 2.5 / 5 Last comment: Skip the theater and wait a year until it comes out on HBO or something and watch it on TV. Don't waste the money going to the theater or renting it.Final grade: 2 / 5",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The 'Just About Okay' Four,"Yeah, you heard the general consensus regarding 'The Fantastic Four's' first major big screen outing. Most people hated it. I didn't hate it, but I'm not warming to it with time. When I first saw it in the cinema I thought it was 'just about okay.' Now I've watched it again on DVD a couple of years over time I'm sticking to my original verdict.In fact, one of its problems is the rest of the 'Marvel' movies. Since 2005 we've been treated to the whole 'expanded universe' where all the Marvel superheroes pop in and out of each other's films. And, it's safe to say that most people like all that (plus Avengers etc). So, basically the current way of doing superhero films is miles above what 20th Century Fox tried back in 2005.The cast isn't really the problem. Even if some of them did get some stick for their portrayals of the characters, I didn't find any of them a problem. They all looked the part to me. However, the problem I had with the movie is that it never really gets going. It's not a long film (only an hour and a half) and, despite getting their superpowers early on, the four central characters don't really do that much with them until literally the final few minutes. I thought this when I first watched it in the cinema, but it wasn't until I saw it again on DVD that I was able to time exactly when the film actually 'got going' (in my opinion). It was about at 1h 20 minutes (out of an hour and a half!). That's when the superheroes finally come together like I was expecting them to and fight Dr Doom.Oh yes... Dr Doom. I mentioned that the casting wasn't that bad. I was referring to the Four. Dr Doom is pretty unspectacular and not that evil. And they only gang up on him at the end, making the whole film seem like a prequel that could have been told in about twenty minutes until the story starts properly.All in all, The Fantastic Four will always be classed as a 'missed opportunity.' Yes, it's already being 'rebooted' and die-hard fans are hoping that Fox will get the formula right this time. Although... rumour has it that the writers are already changing HOW the Four got their powers. Therefore I'm not holding my breath!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a pretty decent comic book movie although it's a far cry from fantastic.,"I would be lying if at any point in time I said I wanted to see the ""Fantastic Four"". While I worked for Eworks, all we did was test TV spots and trailers for this movie and to be honest none of them grabbed my attention at all. In fact this movie looked so bad and I never wanted to see it. But again due to the lack of movies so far this summer, I decided since my brothers wanted to see it that I would see ""The Fantastic Four"" A group of scientists get money to go up into space because they are searching for new ways to cure diseases. While in space some kind of force hits the ship and now everyone on board develops special powers, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) has the ability to become invisible, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) has the ability to turn into fire, Reed Richards (Ian Gruffudd) has the ability to stretch, and finally Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) becomes a rock creature with super strength. Together they become the Fantastic Four! But there was one more scientist named Victor (Julian McMahon) who was on board the ship when the force hit and instead of using his powers for good, he decides to use his powers to destroy the Fantastic Four and ultimately control the world. And so ""The Fantastic Four"" ensues I have to admit I really liked the movie much more then I ever thought was possible. For a comic book movie it's pretty darn good. I mean compared to comic films like ""Blade"", ""Catwoman"", ""Dare Devil"", ""The Hulk"", and ""Elektra"" to name a few, this film is a masterpiece. The story is decent, it could be better but it's a comic book movie so I don't expect great writing. The acting surprisingly isn't too bad either, and that came as a shock. Jessica Alba is improving since her role in the awful"" Honey"" and everyone else is pretty decent as well. Honestly it was a decent popcorn flick, it's nothing to think about or take seriously; you just have to sit back and enjoy.There were a couple of things that hurt the film and I will go over them now. The first thing was the characters outside Sue Storm and Reed Richards were too childish. I mean they seemed like little kids. Also the dialogue was really bad, I mean when Sue says to Johnny and Ben ""stop fighting"", I literally busted out laughing because I couldn't help think what? Are they 3 years old or something? I mean wow who wrote that line. The whole dialogue thing was pretty bad at times basically because of bad one liners like when Dr. Doom goes ""Sue, You're Fired"" I mean give me a break. Also in the end the film feels very rushed. They take so much time for the characters to develop and understand their powers that by the time Dr. Doom comes into the picture it's like 10 minutes before the film ends. I mean the battle at the end was disappointing because it was very short and felt rushed.Overall it's a comic book movie and all comic book movies basically have the same plot, a good guy or in this case good guys get powers, they decide they want to do well; some bad guy gets power as well and wants to use it to destroy the world or control it. Most movies are like this ""Spiderman"", ""The Hulk"","" X-men"" etc. The Fantastic Four does this well. It has a nice amount of action, an OK story, the dialogue needs a little fixing up and so does the end but in the end it's much better then the trailers and critics for that matter lead it to be. I would see the sequel which I know it coming so I can only hope they improve the few things wrong with this one.My final rating for ""The Fantastic Four"" is a 6/10. Go to a matinée or take the kids they will love it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Its Fantastic For Morons,"the Fantastic Four was one of Marvel's longest and most successful running comics. Unfortunately this movie killed it. Maybe this film was not guaranteed any success because the popularity of this comic started sagging over the years. What we get here is a desperate attempt to make an old team of heroes come across as slick, sexy and hip. Man are they hip. You get to see the Thing sport a nice pair of Nike's. Great product placement. In fact, this movie is loaded with so much product placement that I had a hard time distinguishing it from an actual commercial. The Burger King billboard so beautifully displayed behind the action. The American Express line ""catching one of your friends looking silly...priceless."" Yes, these subliminal ads should'nt matter. Its the movie that counts. Right? This movie is so desperate for attention that it needs to sell you a Whopper and some Nikes in order to make you happy. The characters are awful. They act like puppets from a reality show. Where's the depth and complexity? Hey, I know its superheroes but who says you can't have a serious superhero film? Remember Christopher Reeve as Superman? these guys are not even from the same world. They belong to an American Gladiatiors event sponsored by Mountain Dew. What does Stan Lee care anyway? He's got a couple of other comics he can destroy on the big screen. They're just hot cakes waiting to be sold. That's what this is.

Lived up to the Hype.,"Let me start with this, I got a chance to see this movie at a sort of free screening, for that is all i will say on that. Now for the movie, To me this is what A superhero comic should be like. True to its source. Now while Spider-man, Xmen, punisher and Batman Begins are truly great, this movie was just as good if not Fantastic. IOts just like the comic books, and the way it deals with the emotional drama that The Thing goes through is inspiring. The characters are all here and do a great job. Story wise , well like X-men and Spiderman The first movies that they had made really didn't have the best story but not bad either. Just the first movie gitter's. I love super hero movies, i mean who wouldn't, everyone wants to be a hero if not super. Acting was good, special effects are great, story is pretty good overall for being a movie based on the first comic book that i ever received I loved this movie. Say what you will a bout this movie. It is indeed A great superhero flick. Even if you don't like it, you gotta admit its way better, than Elektra or The Hulk.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a children's film!! So don't read so much into it!,"I get annoyed when I read reviews such as Heaths of NY. I am a parent of a nine and a half year old living in London. We love the cinema and go a lot.However I accept that there are films my daughter will love and I think.... rubbish!! But you must remember that most are aimed at CHILDREN!! An Fantastic 4 is such a case. It is a film aimed at children/teenagers NOT adults although I think it did very well at including good humour to keep us adults awake and I can say i enjoyed it, especially the special effects.Of course the plot was thin Heath.... it is not aimed at you an adult film critique type person!! It is a kids film marketed and aimed at kids first and foremost. If you thought otherwise then you are uninformed and naive to say the least.So.. to all people.. it is a good movie for kids and parents alike because parents know what to expect! And the good news for parents is, that is really is quite good and will be a good experience. However I would say that kids under 7/8 will get fidgety because they wont understand the storyline . There were under 6's in the cinema when i went and they were bored and whinging! I really enjoyed it because I have been to kids movies much worse with too much shmaltz and cheesiness.

Sacul gets Doomed by the Fantastic Four.,"Sacul's meaningless movie reviews. Today: Sacul gets Doomed by the Fantastic Four.The comic book geek in me wanted this movie to crawl out of the dark pit most people suspected it would be and come out clobbering.I'm sorry to report it only crawled in circles like a reanimated corpse trying to remember what it was that it was suppose to be doing.On the sliding scale of comic books to film it doesn't fall into Catwoman's litter box but it sure doesn't kick your teeth in like Batman Begins or Spider-man 2 either. This film is pure middle ground and it never tries to excel for anything higher which is a sad way to treat Marvels first family.There is a lesson to be learned with this movie and the lesson is simple, if you plan to give over the director's chair to a non-action/effects type director at least give it to someone who might do something interesting and possibly original with it. If you look at the comic book films that have been successful they are all helmed by directors of vision, people who not only wanted to bring the book to life but bring their style to it. What you don't do is give a potentially huge franchise to directors so far out of their element.Having said that I'll climb off my comic book geek soap box and talk about the movie itself.The movie begins by tripping over its own feet. Reed and Ben are groveling at Victor Von Dooms feet looking for funding, this scene holds zero resonance since you can't understand the rivalry that pre-exists with these two mental giants and how much crow Reed is chewing in the asking. Then it clumsily proceeds to spill the information after the fact to bring us up to speed. The main focus of these two men's fight for attention becomes an imagined love triangle with Sue Storm, not lust for superiority or I.Q envy.The drive of the film is split into too many directions and none of them are great storytelling. Reed is obsessed with curing the team, Johnny is chasing glory, Benn is depressed, and Sue is busy trying to find more outfits to show off her cleavage. Meanwhile Victor is losing his company and turning into a hood ornament in a complete rip off of Norman Osborne's story from the first Spider-man. Not one of these stories pays off so they throw in a few miscellaneous action scenes to keep you interested, so when the battle with Dr Doom begins it's pretty dull and without much direction. Doom's threat doesn't carry any weight and when it's all said and done he doesn't seem to have had anything to gain from it in the first place.The movie does have its strong points though. The interaction between Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm are great fun. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis are the Human Torch and The Thing and they seem to have fun with the roles once they get it down. Everyone else does their best with what they have but the movie already had one huge monkey on its back with The Incredibles having only recently shown us how good a super hero family movie could be. That's a tough film to outshine no matter how you stretch it.The bottom line for fans of the Fantastic Four is that this does not feel like it should, they spend too much time bickering while the movie completely stalls out. For people who don't know the book the special effects and random action scenes might hold your interest long enough to enjoy the movie.Sacul out Excelsior!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Turn Brain Off,"I went into this one with rather low expectations, and somehow managed to come out of the theater disappointed. If you have seen one of the trailers for this one, you probably know 99% of the story and the remaining 1% is really not worth it.Special effects are very poor for such a sci-fi/comic adventure. Acting is in most places below par. Story is as per trailer.Overall total waste of time, not worth seeing, not even worth discussing or reviewing. My rating of 3/10 can be broken up like this: 0/10 for the movie, 3/10 for the occasional good joke from Chris Evans (most of which were previously shown in the trailer(s) and the pleasant features of Jessica Alba.Ioan Gruffudd (Reed Richards) 1/10Jessica Alba (Sue Storm) 4/10 (Acting) 8/10 (Charisma)Chris Evans (Johnny Storm) 7/10Michael Chiklis (Ben Grimm) 4/10 (Includes +1 Bonus for having worn bulky costume for duration of shoot)Julian McMahon (Victor Von Doom) 5/10Tim Story 3/10",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not Marvels Finest but a Fun Superhero Movie,","Fantastic Four is a good movie with a good storyline and a great cast.The movie certainly has its flaws,but it's still a fun superhero movie with lots of cool special effects and good character development.I use to love this film as a child,but it's a lot more mediocre watching it at an older age,but I still can't help but love these characters,all four of them have a special place in my heart.My biggest problem with this movie,which is how a lot of other people feel as well,is Doctor Doom,they didn't develop his character enough and give him a really good reason to be evil,he was basically just bad for the sake of being bad,I also think that Julian McMahon was bad casting,I really felt like he was just acting,he didn't come across as interested in his character.Fantastic Four is a good movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or adventure.A group of astronauts gain superpowers after a cosmic radiation exposure.Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) develops super stretch,Sue Storm (Jessica Alba).can turn invisible,Johnny Storm (Chris Evans),can light himself on fire and fly,and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis),turns into a rock-hard monster with super strength.They must now use these powers to defeat evil.Best Performance: Chris Evans Worst Performance: Julian McMahon",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entering a FUN ZONE. Don't take things too seriously.,"Fantatstic Four is one of the best dumb films to come out in 2005. I mean, it's got the action, the cute chick, the cheesy one-liners, and great special effects. But it also has a touch of soul (most notably in the character the Thing). This is one of those summer blockbuster types that knows it's not a serious movie, therefore it doesn't take itself too seriously. Sure there are plot holes, and many of the characters are one-dimensional, but c'mon, this is not Shakespeare, and the great thing is, it doesn't pretend to be either.If you're looking for some good ol' wholesome fun without having to read too deep into the meanings of what's going on in front of you, then this is the perfect movie for that occasion.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awful,"I don't give such bad reviews often. After all it's only a movie and why should one take it so seriously ? But sometimes it might send a message to people who trounce on something good and make it bad.If the movie was an original plot created by the producers, the director, and the screenwriter, then they can do anything they want with it. But when you take a material someone else have worked hard to make good and establish it's worth over the years, it's like walking into an established culture, and you need to take respect for the work that's already been laid down. Suppose you walked into another culture and just superficially swiped the exterior and presented it through your opinion, have you desecrated the value of that culture ? Most likely.Fantastic Four is the hub of Marvel Comics. Without it, it's questionable if other Marvel comics would have had the success that they've had. It had the quality that defined Marvel. As a matter of fact, Spiderman had his debut supported by the Fantastic Four in Spiderman #1, and from there Daredevil, X Men and other silver age Marvel superheros flourished. Fantstic Four's plot, the universe, the characters were always setting the trend to be mined by other Marvel superheros later.In this movie, there was no respect payed to the original plot of the Fantastic Four or the characters which made the story work. Compared to works done by Bryan Singer in the X Men series where the story line was original but didn't conflict with the original ways characters were presented in the comic book, and plot and subplots were laid out carefully to maximize their characters, this movie just took a broad brush and painted over everything. Casting wasn't good and the actors didn't reflect the qualities of the characters of the Fantastic Four. When they made Doom an industrialist, they made the same mistake of making Talbot an industrialist in the Hulk. Then the only angle becomes about money and power. Doom is an interesting character. He's from a country that's a kin to Transilvania and his mother is a sorcerer, they could have presented him as he is and the story would have been interesting. Instead they just turned him into an one dimensional angry character.This was a movie that could have been better than the Spiderman. Instead they've turned it into an amusement park ride.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Four Out  Of  Five Points Work Well!,"My wife and I always seem to disagree about ...""should you read reviews B/4 going to see a movie"". She doesn't while I tend to read them and regardless if they slam the flick or not I ""usually"" go ahead and sit down at the theater. I Eat my popcorn and decide for myself its' merits. I do pay more attention to some reviewers than others. We all have our favorites. Now then, about the ""Fantastic Four""...I came away with mostly a satisfaction overall. Good casting like Alba made feasting for the eyes. Story line seemed short of depth and some of the characters lacked development. FX's were top flight. This is one comic book movie that met the test of fulfilling the essence of the comic book. My wife liked it somewhat more than me. She never read the comics though which I do believe makes a big difference in one's perspective. Costumes were interesting especially ""The Thing"".

Skip this at all costs,"Reading the previous reviews, I wonder who the hell can actually be giving this film the maximum rating. It's clearly people from the company. 'Fantastic Four' is just a terrible film.As a kid, I didn't read the 'Fantastic Four' comics, but was aware of the origins/backdrop for the group. Unfortunately, the film your average Hollywood crap. I wanted the characters to die a horrible death to get them off the screen. The special effects were average, the action scenes were outright boring, uninspiring, rehashed scenes. The average special effects could not make up for these scenes.Like the title says, skip this movie at all costs, especially if it's a $10 ticket. If you haven't seen them already, go watch 'Batman Begins' or 'War of the Worlds' instead. 'Fantastic Four' is a complete waste of time and money. Hell, even try 'Dark Water' (I haven't seen it, but I can guarantee you its a better film).",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Frankly, I Was Shocked And Awed","A group of astronauts gain superpowers after a cosmic radiation exposure and must use them to oppose the plans of their enemy, Doctor Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon).I grew up on comic books, and I was never thrilled by the Fantastic Four. I cannot pinpoint why, but they were never my thing. Yet, this film took my lack of excitement and turned it around. At least somewhat. It far exceeded my expectations and yet remained as faithful to the comic as possible for a film. The inclusion of ""clobberin' time"" and ""flame on"" was smooth without being kitsch.The effects are mostly good. With, sadly, the exception of Mr. Fantastic. I found the stretching to be very cheesy (though it gets worse in the sequel). The casting was decent, though I am very confused by Jessica Alba. If the point of casting her was to get her to take off her clothes, mission accomplished.

From the Bottom of My Heart...,"By far, this is the worst superhero movie that I have seen....ever. What was the director thinking? Jessica Alba? Give me a break. I own the copy of Fantastic 4 (the one that was made, but never released) and I must tell you that the older of the two is much better. Hey, Hollywood!!! How about a storyline instead of Hollywood flash?!?!?! That would be a fantastic change for the better.

a disappointment as far as comic-book adaptations go in this day and age,"What makes Fantastic Four such a grave misstep of a summer blockbuster is that potential for a better movie is squandered. This potential lies mostly in what was likely a better screenplay- co-written by Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost (which was, in truth, the reason I decided to check out this movie two years after its initial release)- before the producers and other 'committee' members that usually go over and make up their own 'bits' to put into the movie took over. There are kernels of a more entertaining flick here, even as just a goofy B-movie (certain lines of dialog, like ""the clouds are accelerating"" or Thing's line to kids ""don't do drugs). But there's just basic problems that end up becoming all the more apparent and actually annoying as it rolls along.For one thing the characters have been dumbed down, either by aforementioned producers or whomever (maybe it was even Frost for all I know), for a mainstream audience; they're like the fantastic four for the pre-teen mall crowd (i.e. the scene where Johnny Storm goes snowboarding with the nurse seems like it should be on one of those monitors that plays in the food court). There could still be some interesting things to have with stock characters, with one of them at least, Ben Grimm/Thing (played in maybe the only half-way decent job by Michael Chiklis), being compelling in the traditional conflicted superhero fashion of person vs individual powers. But the actors chosen are really all but second-rate, as the characters ask to be played by stars, not so much TV people (yes, even Jessica Alba, as sexy as she can be stripping off to go invisible, ho-ho); Chris Evans also makes it in my un-official book as one of the most annoying performances in any movie in the past few years.And finally, there's the actual craftsmanship being Fantastic Four, which feels the most lax. At a time period when the comic-book adaptation brings out from filmmakers their strongest gifts at making exciting action sequences, spectacular special effects, and fun comedy amid the high momentum of thrilling moments, Tim Story just doesn't cut it with the rest of them (i.e. Sam Raimi, Bryan Singer, Chris Nolan). Maybe this should've been expected, as it is his first huge summer action movie, but nevertheless his skills at making action seem dynamic- chiefly with what should be a harrowing rescue scene on the Brooklyn bridge- is close to nil, and seems to not have much input into making the intentionally comedic moments, or just slight moments of wit, worth even a chuckle. And unfortunately Story isn't even outrageous enough to make Fantastic Four an awesomely bad movie, where there can be some guilty-pleasure to be had in over-the-top performances. Timing seems to be off in several scenes with the fantastic four dealing with their conflicts of newly found powers, and doesn't even have a kooky enough villain in Doom.All around, it's a let-down, mostly as one looking at the writing, which I almost feel a little sorry for (the writers, I mean, not necessarily the script as it appears in the final product), and the filmmakers don't seem to know that it lacks the dimension in character or the punch in action and visual splendor to even sit in the same crowd as a Spiderman or Batman movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
B...o...r...i...n...g,"This is the worst Marvel-based film of the 21st century (so far at least...).

Meanwhile, character development seems pointless, as the film fails to raise the viewer's interest in the background and/or well-being of anyone being described. The viewer is left with no better idea of what Reed is all about than they had before watching the film; all the dreary, long-winded ""development"" scenes only amount to a guy that can stretch...X-men and Spider-man are much better.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

World's Not-So Greatest Film Adaptation,"Comic book fans have been treated with some excellent film adaptations of their favourite heroes and heroines. The Spider-Man & X-Men films, as well as Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins have set a new standard by which future Marvel and DC comics franchises will be tested. As the self-proclaimed ""World's Greatest Comics Magazine"", the Fantastic Four are anything but in this adaptation directed by Tim Story (Barbershop); amidst these other hero films, the Fantastic Four should be ashamed. Where does the film go wrong? The budget was in place, the casting was not terrible and there was plenty of great source material (decades of comics) to work with. Even the director and editors seem to have done decently worked around what seems to be the film's main failure: the lack of any engaging plot. Fantastic Four is an origin story with an eighties montage and an anti-climactic ending, featuring a villain whose purpose for committing villainy is obscure.The inclusion of fan-favourite Jessica Alba as Sue Storm gives way to pointless fan-service excursions. The creative discussion must have gone as such: Producer: ""We need some T&A."" Writer: ""Okay, I've added this scene where she has to become invisible, but she can only be invisible if she gets naked."" Producer: ""I like it, but how are we going to see some T&A if she's invisible?"" Writer: ""Well, you know, she's having troubles adjusting to her powers, so when she's in her undergarments she'll temporarily lose her invisibility."" Producer: ""Sweet deal."" Obviously, the writers never paid attention to the golden rule of film-making: that every scene in some way contributes to the evolving plot or character development. Perhaps the near lack of plot may be at fault here. Clocking in at a mere 100 minutes, the movie still could have used some editing.Fantastic Four is not all bad. Being a fan of the comic series, the characters and their personalities were not meddled with. Some of the most entertaining scenes in the film involve the ever-famous rivalry between hotshot Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) and the hardheaded Ben Grimm (The Thing). Likewise, the future relationship between blind love interest Alicia Masters and Ben Grimm was introduced in the film. Unfortunately, Ms. Masters' role was minute; considering the dramatic issue that is Ben Grimm's transformation into a hideous amalgamation of man and rock, more development between the softness of Alicia and their budding relationship could have added to the film's potency. Unfortunately, Marvel Comics' producers were aiming for a more action-packed film. As such, Fantastic Four still falls behind most films in the genre, as the final showdown between the group and Viktor Von Doom (the pointless villain) never reaches the intensity of Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock or Batman vs. Ra's Al Ghul. For longtime fans of the comics, famous lines such as The Thing's ""It's clobberin' time!"" and the Human Torch's ""Flame on!"" are but brief excursions from an otherwise dismal attempt at the superhero genre. Despite the obvious borrowing of ideas, Brad Bird's The Incredibles provides a much more satisfying experience for superhero fans. (3/10 - Poor)",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's just *there*...,"Yet *another* of the conveyor belt line production systems provides us with a comic book adaptation, and this time it's the Fantastic Four.Jessica Alba is about the most famous name here, and she's the overly attractive and cleavage-endowed Sue Storm. Along with a group of 3 scientist she makes a trip to the moon (I think) to sample DNA (I think) but when a sunflare attacks the expedition the crew all experience genetic changes and find themselves with super powers.Yup, all original plot here.The rest of the movie sees the four of them at loggerheads with Von Doom, the big bad guy. Sort of.You see, the Fantastic Four is all a bit pointless. 4 scientist types get physically changed and then we wonder what the point is. Are they using these powers for good, or are they just trying to entertain the viewer? The ending reel is incredibly anti-climactical and really unsatisfying; not to mention cheesy and unoriginal.I honestly feel confused by what I make of this one; on one hand it *did* entertain for sure, but on the other it was completely futile and I got nothing out of it.As mentioned, for the guys there is Jessica Alba and her ample cleavage, and that's the attempt at giving the film sex appeal. To be fair, it works. She is a very hot lady.And yet there's little more to say about all this.It will kill an hour and a half, but if you expect something to think about and discuss, you might want to look elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Despite The Story Is Shallow, It Is Still Watch Able.","Out of the whole lots of Super Heroes Movie, this is by far the most cartoonish with actual cartoon like storyline. But it turn out not to be so bad.This movie doesn't have the actual story or villain or anything. Just an introduction to how they become Fantastic 4 and slowly discovered their ability and how to make the society accept them. That about it, really. The story is extremely shallow also the characters. And it even seems like rip-off from many places.Anyway I personally think people go to see this movie because of beautiful Jessica Alba (she looks so DAMN Hot!!!!), and maybe Christ Evan, who help to add some charisma and humor to the movie. And the other two was more of a miscast. Personally, I think they are too old and if they're not old they still look like one.This movie is definitely out of other super heroes movie league.

"Another ""Millennium Dome Syndrome"" film","Spectacularly awful - no amount of Hollywood hype and millions spent in advertising is enough to salvage this film I'm afraid.In the 1990's some drunk politician espoused the idea of celebrating the Millennium by making an enormous dome on the banks of the River Thames. No-one considered what should be inside it - just that it seemed a great idea. That same drunk individual, I believe, came up with this film.This empty film goes to show that it is once again, perfectly possible to say ""Let's make a super-hero film"" then strangle it with a poor story, castrate it with ham-acting and finish it off with talentless direction.If you're looking for a super-hero film with a plausible story line, escapist fantasy .... then steer clear of this film.I got increasingly fed up having to force myself to suspend reality to 'get into' the film, but the acting from just about all the cast was SO awful that I was forced back into a cinema seat watching a silver screen wondering why I was watching a somewhat poor, fourth-rate Bollywood production.I just wish the director had told the actors to learn their lines instead of allowing them to read them from boards off-camera; and at least to make some second-rate attempt at delivering the lines as if they meant them, and not be satisfied with the cast blankly reading their lines to camera.It was a great film apart from the storyline, the script, the acting, and the directing .... a film in a league with Batman (1989) and The Saint (1997).The film ended (after a tortuous, mind-numbing two hours) tempting us to believe in a sequel.

"This entry is just for kids, too much brat, wimp and a windbag villain.","Sadly, this entry in the Marvel comic book heroes to movie adaptations is the weakest of the lot, made for kids with cardboard, stereotyped characters. And what's worse is that Fantastic Four was the premier Marvel super hero group of all back in the day. Every Marvel fan was eagerly anticipating this in hopes that it might equal the X-men or Spiderman series, or at least come close. Alas, it is merely lukewarm at best. How could there be so much great character development in X-men and Spiderman in a mere two hours, and such lack of it here? Why is there no grand hero activity to enthrall us, except for the resolution of the bridge mishap, which was all caused by the Thing in the first place! Anyone who knows anything about comic book lore knows that George Lucas based Darth Vader on the great Dr Doom of the comic book fame. Better to watch Vader again than this poor hammy excuse of Doom. Only Jessica Alba and Michael Chiklis put any punch into their portrayals.

Satisfying.  A good popcorn film.,"So America enters a stage of consistently making film adaptations of comic books (Spider-Man, Hulk, Daredevil, Elektra, The Punisher, Catwoman, X-Men, Batman Begins...). The question is... where are our classic four heroes that everyone knows and loves? We already took care of Spider-Man and Hulk, but where is the Fantastic Four? Well, here they are. Weren't they easy to see coming?I didn't expect a very good movie. I'm not a very big Fantastic Four fan anyway. I prefer darker comics such as Batman, The Punisher, Elektra, and so on. I was very disappointed when I first saw the trailer for the movie, because it didn't look very good at all. However, I still went to see it, because I'm a big fan of comic books, and other than Hellboy (which I'm not sure whether or not is an adaptation of a comic, but I heard from someone that it is) I have seen every Marvel & DC movie that has been released since Spider-Man (which obviously is the film that started this comic madness). I was actually rather impressed. It wasn't all that, but it was much better than I expected.Doctor Doom's character was played with an awesome dark and sinister quality, which I believe was the highest point of the film. All four of our lost and confused heroes are played with excellence and brilliance, especially Johhny Storm/The Human Torch. He was very funny, and that helped brighten up some of the very few moments that got too slow-paced and a bit boring.I also liked that the movie both possessed innocent and illuminated qualities such that Spider-Man did and also dark and murderous qualities similar to how The Punisher did (as Doctor Doom unreasonably murdered an approximate total of five civilians).A good movie if all you're looking for is a good movie to watch while mouthing down a delicious bag of buttery and salty popcorn. If you're looking for excellence and near perfection, then it is not a recommendation. It still somewhat holds my original expectations of being a disappointing movie, but since it was much better than expected, I did like it.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four? Maybe Mediocre Four,"I have to admit that Fantastic Four was not as fantastic as I thought it would be (excuse the pun, couldn't resist). While even if you try to deal with the movie as plain silly fun, it still fails. I have to admit I do not know anything about the comic book so I was left a little clueless at certain points. But shouldn't the movie deal with telling the audience about the background information? I personally think that the movie lacked direction and could've been better, but wasn't. The actors were very beautiful and handsome, but they lacked any personality. The only one I thought did well was The Thing. The others were just sub-par. Jessica Alba, being as hot as she is, couldn't make the movie any more enjoyable.By the end of the movie, I was questioning myself. This is it? The movie was just filled with light overused humor, along with kiddie special effects. A movie that could've been fantastic turns out flat. In my opinion it's worth a rental and well maybe go and see it in the theaters for the eye-candy. Other than that, you may want to skip it and see something else.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not so Fantastic Four,"After reading the numerous reviews about this movie, I went expecting a complete and total disaster of a film, what I got wasn't quite that bad. Make no mistake, I am not saying that this is a good movie by any stretch, but it does measure up better than Daredevil and The Hulk.The story moves far too slowly, and way too much time is given to building up the origins of the characters, but it was somewhat watchable. Still the movie could have used a bit more action, and a bit less ""worried scientist."" The special effects are weak seeming to be of the Terminator 2. I am thankful that they decided to do The Thing via makeup as opposed to CGI because, as in the case of Hulk, the bad computer animation would have made the character even more laughable. The acting was not great, but honestly was a little better than I was expecting.I think the biggest culprit in the failure of this film is Tim Story. I have to question why Story was given this movie to direct, and on a deeper level why he keeps receiving projects - one would have thought that the deplorable Taxi would have ended his career. Other Superhero films have been blessed by superior directing talents like Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan, Sam Raimi, Bryan Singer, and even Richard Donner, and have all been blessed by these creative directors bringing a unique sense of vision to their film. With Batman Begins and Sin City we had films that brought comic books to life - sadly in comparison Fantastic Four belongs on the discount rack.The movie does have one big plus - it is a chance to watch the unbelievable beautiful Jessica Alba for two hours - so it ain't all bad. In the end if you can only see one superhero flick this summer go see Batman Begins, if you want some light fluff - this one won't kill you, but it won't satisfy you either.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four,"This movie was really good. It is one of the best superhero movies I have seen! I can't believe that this movie has been taken so much crap from all those movie critics. Fantast 4 has comedy, drama, action and everything a movie needs to be number 1. Granted Fantastic Four is no X-Men, but I liked it better than any of the Spider-Man movies. It is true that you should not compare it to X-Men, Fantastic Four, or Hellboy because Fantastic Four is good in it's own genre. The special effects in this movie are somewhat disappointing, especially the Mr. Fantastic effects. Other than that the invisible force fields (which I found too Jean Greyishy) were cool, and the fire was really cool too. Well you should really check this movie out!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
waste of time!,"The recent outpouring of superhero movies has had its hits (Spiderman, X-men, The Incredibles...) and its misses (Electra, Catwoman...), but Hollywood fails to savor comic-book fan's prided foremost family of ab-normals: The Fantastic Four. Top reasons this film will not have any sequels (hopefully):the villain: Or should I say ""villian""? Audiences cannot manage to cheer for the heroes if the evil is not being evil. Doctor Doom left me wondering, ""Huh?"" It could have been the acting or it could have definitely been the story or maybe the plot, but the fact remains: no conflict!The Invisible Woman: The special effects sucked and, yes, the dialog, too, but Sue Storm does not bring to mind smart, powerful women. Being the only female in the group and amazingly the middle of a cheesy love triangle, Ms. Storm represents only the nagging, bitchy trailer-trash mothers that are a part of the feminine population. Very disappointing. When is Hollywood going to get an admirable, awe-inspiring superwoman into the theaters? Here's hoping for Wonder Woman.The Special Effects: Or lack of them. I get the feeling that the producers must have been running on a tight budget because I was watching Gumby with arm hair and a rendition of the early The Invisible Man. The Human Torch and The Thing were a little better than mediocre but I felt as if they were harnessing the glories of 21st century special effects. The entire movie slowly lead up to a poorly choreographed climax filled with cheesy, scientific ways the ""fantasic"" four try to defeat a bafflingly threatening(?) enemy.There are at least ten other reasons this film fails to impress, but I must say I loved Johnny Storm and Ben Grim. I also loved the genuine puppy love Reed Richards has for Sue and there scenes together are cute and deserving of cotton candy romance stories. Chris Evans shines above all of ""Fantastic Fours""'s shortcomings. Though the film strikes out, it may lead Fox to finally learn from its mistakes.-",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sweet Movie,"I went to the midnight showing and although the theater was almost packed but it was a smaller theater and drew nowhere near the size crowd that batman begins had at midnight which is discouraging for the box office but anyway... this movie rocked. Now, I'm not a hard core Fantastic Four fan but I know them well enough for various comic books I've picked up and their appearances in Spider-Man comics (I'm a huge Spidey fan) so I don't know what all the hard core F4 fans will nitpick at but to me it was great fun. There is a lot of humor in the film and the characters are great and mesh well with each other. I'll probably see this one again sometime.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Comic book movies don't get much better,"Let's preface this review/comment by saying this ""it's a movie based on a comic book"". Undaunted by the professional ""Critic"" reviews I attended this movie and was pleasantly entertained. It was everything I would expect...big special effects, comic book action and a great story line.As compared to Citizen Kane, the Fantastic 4 is not a good movie but put it on a scale with other comic book movies it ranks just below Spiderman 2 and above Batman begins.So is it all good? Not really. The casting of Jessica Alba as Susan Storm ""Invisible Girl"" was a poor decision. While the always attractive Alba does a fine job she seems to constantly be waiting for her cue to be struck. And Ioan Gruffudd seems to have trouble with his character too. While some may say that it is bad acting I felt that the problem was a complete lack of time in the story. Which brings us to the problem with the story. The Fantastic Four (comic book) is more about the interaction of the 4 individuals as one super team and their relationships, the villain/crime is more of a side-story, the producer/director spent a great deal of time building up to the obligatory confrontation. Maybe (hopefully) in a sequel they will spend more time on that relationship.The biggest saving grace (or graces if that is proper) are the casting/acting of Michael Chiklis as Ben ""The Thing"" Grimm and Chris Evans as Johnny ""The Human Torch"" Storm. They have so much competence in the roles that you truly believed they were their characters, which is after all what they are supposed to do.If what you are after is a fulfilling superhero movie with comic book action and fun go and see ""The Fantastic Four"", if not...then there are probably a dozen other movies showing...go see one of them.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not great but not totally boring,"One actually expects these comic book flicks to receive some great attention to detail, story, SFX etc given their extensive popularity but that does not apply in this movie's case. This movie seems to made just for the sake of it. It is small, limited, underdone in most areas and would probably be considered an utter failure in terms of story. Some of the CGI is really really bad and not expected from such a franchise, especially the extending hand CGI. There are too many annoying puns and the dialog is stupid. The fight scenes are pure bull. However if you don't expect anything great and just want to be entertained for over an hour, go see this movie. Prepare to be disappointed if you're a big fan of the franchise though. Having said that the movie does have a lot of positives here and there.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not too bad at all,"After hearing all the fanboys knock this one, I was prepared to really be disappointed with this movie. After all, there have been a couple of other attempts to get a FF movie out. And most of the comic movies (excuse me...graphic novels) have been pretty average.However, I thought this movie held up pretty well. The graphics were pretty good, the acting was adequate, and the script was great. I was not disappointed, go see this movie.Note to all the 'true to the source' idiots out there...to be true to the source, you'd have to realize that these are just comics and the source is pen and ink, not real people. I thought Jessica Alba was great as Sue Storm! If she is not Aryan enough for some, too bad, you boys can go back to your closet, iron your sheets, and wait for the next rally. Why does her background have to match your expectations? I mean for hundreds of years, Jesus Christ was portrayed as white? And who complained? Who knew? Anyway this movie is definitely worth the matinée price I paid, and even for those of you who like to pay full price, it would be worth full admission.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow...'Fantastic' is just not the adjective,"Oh boy. Where do I even start? I'm not going to hate on this film. I'm only going to provide an honest review. Here we go. In a nutshell, this is an entertaining movie. It's a FUN movie. With that said, this will please more kids than anything. Teenage boys will like it for Alba (sigh), kids will like it because it's funny and fun, and everyone else might either hate it or find it at least entertaining. I fit in with everyone else. This movie was OKAY at best. I've never read the comic books, but I know enough about the Fantastic Four to say that not much justice was done to them. Reed Richards was mediocre, Sue Storm was not convincing as a character, Johnny Storm was either irritating or funny (at least true to his character), and The Thing was the one that very convincing and the only one I remotely cared for. Maybe it's because of the casting? I did not feel this to be the Fantastic Four at all. It felt more like a comedy. If it were, it would be a good one. But come on! This is the FF4! Why not be like how Spider-Man was and show us who they are? This could have been an excellent movie. But Doctor Doom, my all-time favorite Marvel villain (and perhaps the best villain) was done NO justice whatsoever. Okay, so McMahon is a decent actor. He did what he could. But there is no Victor von Doom here. Suddenly in this movie he's a comedian. Making lame jokes? Come on, that's not Doom! Perhaps there is too much Victor and not an ounce of Doom. Okay, I got that out of the way. Now let us move on to Alba as Sue Storm, which was obviously done for eye candy and eye candy only. I wanted to see her as Sue and not as Alba. With her acting skills and the bad script, Sue Storm surely seems to be invisible. I wanted this to be good, but alas this is the movie. The special effects are pretty good. The only battle scene left me saying, ""What? That's all? That's the climax battle?"" It was that unsatisfying. There really is no story here and I don't know what else to say except that it was just okay. No depth and there is almost no reason for anything that happens in this film. Maybe because Tim Story should not have directed it? I don't know, but 'Fantastic' is just not the adjective to describe this movie. It was what it COULD HAVE been, but sadly it was not. But as I said before, there is a high chance that the kids will like it, especially since it is entertaining at best =)5.7/10 Stars",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A flash in the pan...,"...that's all this movie is. From the creative genius of Avi Arad comes another big-budget, low-intelligence superhero flick. Following in the footsteps of such fine films as Elektra and The Punisher, we have a group of government scientists who are bombarded with cosmic rays in space and given super-powers. Why does this movie suck so bad?1) Characters/Acting: I mean, how do you expect me to believe these people are a team? The comic book FF are like a family, with Sue being a mother-like figure, and Reed being the grizzled leader of the group. You don't get that feeling in this movie. While Reed is busy moping because Sue is sleeping with Victor Von Doom, Ben Grimm is busy feeling sorry for himself and Johnny has gone to join the X-Games. This is characterization? Anyway, another thing that irked me was the similarity in origin between Victor Von Doom and Norman Osborn. I mean, from the firing of the villain by his board of directors, to the concept of being in a freak accident, to the long and drawn out speeches the villain does, you could just change the two guys around and everything would still be the same. As for the acting, with the exception of Michael Chiklis, all the actors sucked horribly. Here's a suggestion: the next time Marvel casts a movie, maybe they should try to get an ACTUAL actress, instead of a woman who is only in the plot for T&A scenes.2) Plot: all in all, forgettable. If you gained the ability to generate fire or have rock skin, wouldn't you be a little bit freaked out? Not if you're Johnny Storm! Instead, you go skiing and join a motocross team. Good job! Scenes like Ben's wife leaving her ring on the ground and Sue and Reed's discussions about their relationships were essentially meaningless. When you know what's going to happen at the end of the movie, there's no point in even seeing it. Reed gets Sue, FF defeats bad guy, I've seen it many times before.3) Plot holes: including, but not limited to: Ben being able to turn back into the Thing in less than 5 minutes, a heat-seeking rocket trailing Johnny when he's not even generating fire (possibly not a plot hole), no one even bothering to arrest any of the FF at the bridge, even when Ben Grimm caused the whole accident in the first place, no explanation on how the travellers get back from space after being hit with the cosmic rays, and most importantly, the fact that when you superheat an object, then cool it down, IT EXPLODES. It doesn't harden. For a guy who talks about Biology 101, Reed is an idiot.Bottom Line: You're better off watching Batman Begins.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I wasted an hour and half of my life,"After watching the trailers of FF, I thought it had everything-superheroes, bad guy, special effects and Jessica Alba. But OMG this is one the worst action films of all time. The film has no beginning, you are just thrown into a world where the characters are so stereotyped and god damn unbelievable. At least Spiderman had a decent amount of character development before the whole film fell down hill. But FF had nothing to draw me in. The acting was from a B-movie that had been pushed down to a f-movie. It had two good actors in it- the guy from the shield and and van doom from nip/tuck, but they were as bad as the rest. and as for the director- give me a hundred million quid and I'd make a true action film which actually would be worth seeing! This guy knew nothing about continuity, film flow and most of all, story telling! Anyone who finds this film thrilling/entertaining, needs to have their head examined!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four,"I was actually surprised by this interpretation of the Fantastic Four. The movie was funny and engaging. I especially liked the interactions between the Human Torch and the Thing. They were hilarious!!While I considered the casting to be rather crazed and uneven when it was announced I did actually enjoy the performances. The pacing of the film was a bit slow but understandable as it is laying the foundation for this particular interpretation.Julian McMahon was of course hot as usual and compelling. The tweak on the Dr. Doom angle was a bit unwelcome yet it worked in Julian's capable hands.I also like the casting of the Alicia Masters character and commend Hollywood for casting people of color in so called ""traditional roles"". There should have been more of Kerry Washington in the movie! In FF4 2 more Alicia! It's a fun summer movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fantastic 4 is the second best comic book movie from marvel.,"Yes, what you read is absolutely right. I saw this one at a local theater with my friend. There was an advanced screening of the movie here in Toronto, Canada. Earlier, me and my friend was expecting this movie to be like Hulk-awesome special effects but too boring. But after watching the entire movie which was around 117(actual movie running time)we both were proved absolutely wrong. The movie turned out to be Fantastic. The story of the movie was fine with proper introduction to all characters, the duologue's spoken by each character suited well. ex: Dr. Doom having manipulative and cunning lines, Human torch having cool, funny lines, Mr. fantastic having scientific and sometimes leadership like lines, the Thing having serious emotional lines as well as few funny lines and finally Invisible woman having motherly and emotional lines. The special effects are the best ever seen and I have no doubt this movie will be nominated for the best visual effects at Oscars. The end battle scene between the Fantastic 4 and Dr. Doom is the best thing I have ever seen, Unlike spider-man 2 that had a lame battle scene at the end of the movie between Dr. octopus and spider-man. Overall, the movie was so awesome that the 30-40 people watching along with us at the theater said WOW, cool, amazing all kind of words to cheer the movie when the movie was over. On top of that most of them said they will watch it again on opening weekend. I am absolutely amazed by this movie. This will make tons of money up to $500 million worldwide. I give it a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Funtastic"" Four","Let's preface this entire review with this...I never watched the Fantastic Four cartoons or read the comic books. That being said... This was a fun movie. It had some pretty exciting special effects, especially the human torch/ Johnny Storm scenes. It had some fun humor...OK, it was kind of ""campy"" humor in spots, but hey... what can be more fun than a silly joke or gag? I thought the story was interesting, especially since I personally did not know the history of how they came to be the Fantastic Four. I don't understand why people have to compare movies to other movies...can't a movie just be a fun experience...this was a fun popcorn movie...a fun date flick, and a fun family movie...my 6 year old really enjoyed it as well.

Great way to spend an afternoon at the movies.,"I've never been a fan of the Fantastic Four and frankly did not give this movie much of a thought back when I heard a movie was being made about them. Having been a comic book fan for 30 years, I have always enjoyed the Human Torch and the Thing in their own adventures or when teamed up with another character but the Fantastic Four itself always left me flat. I have read many issues over the years but it has never really hooked me in. My kids actually wanted to see this movie more than I did (apparently there is a newer cartoon series around that got them excited about it) and so I took them on opening day to sort of get it over with.I was pleasantly surprised.The movie loosely follows the origin of the team and does well to illustrate the relationship between the characters. The love/hate relationship between Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm, Ben's role as Reed's protector while at the same time blaming him for his situation, Sue Storm's unreturned affection for Reed, Reed's reluctant role as leader and analytical but naive reasoning. Reed's relationship with Victor Von Doom. It's all in here. There are many little things tossed in for comic fans as well... Doom's return to Latvia (presumably as ruler), Ben's raincoat and fedora, Johnny sky-writing the flaming F4 signal in the sky (which goes way back to the 1960s comic books), and a few other nice touches.Although the story is flawed in parts... the whole Ben Grimm/Doom transformation part was not very well thought out. But other parts are very well done... I really like the way the relationship between Reed and Doom was explained and how the Doom character developed. Although in this movie does take it's fair share of artistic license such as Doom being with the F4 when exposed to the cosmic storm (which was not the case in the comics). I usually don't like when they fundamentally change things like this in comic-to-movie adaptations but here it actually works very well and helps explain why the relationship between Reed Richards and Dr. Doom is so venomous.The acting ranges from acceptable to pretty good. Michael Chiklis was very good in both the Ben Grimm/Thing roles running the gauntlet of emotions from self-pity to reluctant hero pretty well. Jessica Alba was good but it was a little hard to believe that she would be chasing Ioan Gruffudd but did give this movie much needed sex appeal. Ioan Gruffudd did an acceptable job as Reed Richards albeit a bit bland which I'm not sure if Gruffudd's acting or the character itself is just bland. Chris Evans also did a very good job providing the humor elements and reckless nature of Johnny Storm. Julian McMahon did a splendid job as crazy old Dr. Doom and his fall from grace was well portrayed if a bit hurried. Limited screen time kept me from fully enjoying the Dr. Doom character.All in all, while not perfect, this movie is a great way to spend a lazy summer afternoon. It's a fun movie with great visual effects, a decent story, and generally good acting that keeps the action humming along at a good clip. The movie plays very well for kids.. both my kids liked it very much. If I had to judge this movie against other Marvel movies I would put it above the Hulk and a little behind the first Spiderman movie and of course far above Daredevil and the Punisher.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Full of action,"This movie is a little thin on plot, but it delivers more than might have been promised. Alba's acting is light, but the main emotional force is hammered home by McMahon as Dr. Doom and Chiklis as the Thing. Are there tremendous plot twists? No. But the film may benefit from low expectations and the fact that much cannot be expected from what is no doubt hoped to be the first in a series. FF sets the story up, certainly for those who haven't read the comic. For those who have, they're already buying in. I'm guessing the movie will be successful enough to deliver the force for a sequel. The ending obviously leaves open that possibility.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but not great.A little overcooked on the comedy side and a little light on action. Decent attempt however.,"Although i quite enjoyed the tone of Fantastic Four and found myself more entertained than most led me to believe i would be i still got a nagging feeling that an opportunity had been missed here.The foursome are all great fun in their roles,Jessica Alba looks stunning as Sue Storm and Chris Evans is a bolt of energy as Torch.The problem is a lack of action and just a little too much comedy.That said, when the action does kick in , its whizz bang stuff with some impressive CGI,just a pity there wasn't a bit more.Im not sure if the film could have actually been made much better than it was.Its a tough ask to make a film about multiple super heroes.Bryan Singer did a great job of it with his X-Men films but those levels of entertainment are not quite realised here.A fun film but slightly short of the the quality expected.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow - Buck Rogers for the kindergarten set - but with fx!,"Trying to figure out when I've seen a worse movie. Abounds in non-sequiturs, illogic and physically impossible events.This should never be confused with either fantasy or science fiction - this is plain action (this means blowing things up - there is a little bit of violence but it's mostly flashy bits with very little harm done to anyone). Afterward we decided that there was one person on the movie that must have consistently had this dialog with the screenwriter (who obviously quit very early in the production process): ""Should we explain why this might happen now?"" ""Nah, just blow something up!"" There are several laughs - a couple of them intended and a couple of 'this is completely ridiculous.' So you might enjoy that.PG-13: If your kids are 13 or over I bet you they will think this pretty stupid.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Typically American film-making,"After solid appearances this year of Sin City and Batman, seeing comic book adaptation Fantastic Four is a fantastic letdown: The general idea about four colleagues in the space business undergoing radical physical changes is interesting but the execution is loud and repetitive, and the actors are disconnected from their mission.Spawned from another Stan Lee comic, this film version takes almost the whole film to have the four principal characters, who have been transformed into superheroes by a cosmic storm, come to terms with their new gifts, including being a human torch, stretching your body like elastic, becoming invisible, and being a rock with its attendant strength.It's all typically American film-making with the accent on stunning graphics and de-emphasis on character and story depth. The plot includes the necessary villain, who looks invulnerable for a while; the effects of a romance among principals gone badly; and the transformation of tough guys into softies and the reverse. All clichés are alive and functioning well here.After killing a doctor who tells him his ""entire biophysical structure changing,"" the villain says, ""I think I'll get a second opinion.""

Not Fantastic Enough,"Fantastic Four is an alright movie, but it just fails in comparison to the other superhero movies. At least the movie stays very true to the characters. Thing- The best character in in the movie. He is portrayed the best in the movie, played very well by Michael Chiklis. If only they had deleted the whole romance story though. Mr. Fantastic- The worst character in the movie, his special effects looked fake. His character was boring. Torch- Very well done by Chris Evans, missing long blonde hair though. Invisible Woman- Jessica Alba is HOT. She was good at being the invisible woman. Dr.Doom- Julian Mcmahon was just OK as Doom. His character needed more backstory. I still think that Ralph Fiennes would have been a better Doom. The movie has a very thin storyline so don't expect a lot.Overall it is not a Fantastic movie just an average one. Mediocre.

"Not very exciting, but entertaining","""Fantastic Four"" is an entertaining and perfect film for teenagers and children. It is a good adaptation of the famous comics. But, obviously, this film is not as good as the comics. The film is not bad, is good for having a good while, but if we compare with other adaptations of others comics (""Spiderman"", ""Batman"", ""Sin City"") this obviously is not the best one.This film tells us how a group of scientists runs accidentally into a cloud of energy in a space trip, which turn them superheroes. Then, they decide to save the city of all evil with their superpowers.As far as the fight scenes, it is the most disappointing subject of the film. They don't fight a lot, they only do it in the final scenes. In other films of superheroes like ""Spiderman"" the heroes fight a lot against their villains. But the four fantastic spend the majority of their time doing mathematics and solving equations, not fighting against doctor Von Doom. But other things in the film are not bad. If you want to have a good time and don't get bored, you should rent this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not fantastic at all,"For starters I must say, I had a lot of expectation concerning the Fantastic Four movie. I am a huge fan of super heroes and I was looking forward to seeing this foursome kick ass.In my opinion, the opening shots were pretty good. Considering we're dealing with a very complicated plot concerning space shuttles and electromagnetic storms, the opening sequences were surprisingly well handled.OK, the good ends right there. Bad stuff coming in.Most of the characters are completely shallow. I was really looking forward to seeing Dr. Doom in action, but I was very disappointed with the character's dialogues and handling. The script makes him look like a rich maniac (and that's good), but when he comes back from space, all altered, that's when it goes down.Von Doom goes from being a very concerned and jealous man to a murdering maniac in a few moments (and, for the record, he's not a great murdering maniac, in fact he sucks at it).The Fantastic 4: -The Thing: On the comic book, this is a funny and cool character. They tried to make it the same in the movie, but they didn't succeed. The material from which the suit is built is completely fake. It's supposed to be stone and it looks as if it is rubber or something.-The Invisible Girl: Jessica Alba looks pretty hot in this movie and her acting wasn't that bad. She was among the very few good things you could say about this movie.-The Human Torch: This is a cool character and it was pretty well written and the situations in which he was involved were pretty good. But when he starts to burn, that sucks, it's really fake. And the scriptwriters made him pretty secondary and made the main characters Mr Fantastic and The Thing.-Mr. Fantastic: SUCKS. The acting was lousy, that guy is too young to play that character, the special effects that tried to make him stretch were at times worse than the movie itself, and his dialogues were never good.All in all, I think audiences will be disappointed with this movie because it lacks everything that made other comic book adaptations (Spider-Man, Batman Begins, X-Men) good.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An honest super hero film,"I went to watch this film not expecting too much, partly due to some recent disappointments, as well as due to the tendency to heavily lace super hero films with CGI until they look like second rate computer games.This film was a pleasant surprise.I'd always perceived FF to be one of the ""less dark"", family oriented comic books. This may be wrong, but that's the impression I had. So to me, the film held true to the comic book atmosphere. It goes to prove the point that a solid script goes a long way towards making a good film. Casting was OK (only *very minor* objection being Jessica Alba, whose skin complexion does not help her portray a blue-eyed blonde, but who did a good job as Susan Storm.)Special effects were put to very good use, especially in the cases of the Thing and the Human Torch, and were used in good measure, without becoming overwhelming. All in all, a good adaptation of a popular comic book, which will probably appeal to the general public, without annoying the comic book fans by straying too far off the comic book.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Who in their right minds would give this pile of $#!@ a 10???,"I just saw this movie, and I am extremely disappointed. It's another one in a long list of bad decisions regarding comic book movies, the worst of which have not yet been released (X-Men 3, anyone?). What a misfire! And to think that according to the trivia page, Steven Soderbergh was interested in directing, George Clooney was considered for the role of Reed Richards, Naomi Watts for Sue Storm, and Tim Robbins for Dr. Doom. Instead, we get Tim Story, who is one of the worst directors working today, and a cast comprised of B-list actors or television stars. This was the most unattractive cast I've seen since The Dreamcatcher. In particular, I couldn't stand Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd). There was absolutely nothing in this film to hold my interest. Where is the plot? The script had the structure of a sit-com. A bunch of semi-amusing occurrences, pasted together with no real development, conflict, character arcs, etc. The effects ranged from bad to mediocre. There was even one shot where you could see the wrinkles of the latex in The Thing's suit, right after Deb rushes off to the street wearing nothing but a skimpy night-gown (!). Even Dr. Doom, which has a great costume design in the comics, managed to look terrible thanks to a corny face-shaped iron mask (instead of the menacing, expressionistic, angular, metal-plate mask of the comics) and a golden shirt which looked like it came from the dressing room of a really cheap children show. The score was also annoying, and reminded me of TV shows like Sweet Valley High or The Flinstones, where whenever somebody slipped there was this ""Wee-wee-wee-wee"" sound effect to emphasize the comedy. Whenever there was a situation in Fantastic Four that was supposed to make us laugh, the score became unbearably goofy. The look of the movie was awful. Reed's machines looked like tinker-toys, and the whole thing had this plasticized, fake feeling to it. Nothing looked real, yet the style wasn't defined enough to be campy or cartoony. The characters lacked depth, and the only one who managed to bring something other than the obvious traits to their character (i.e. Doom=evil & megalomaniac, Torch=cocky & reckless, etc.) was Michael Chiklis, whose performance I enjoyed. What we end up with is a clichéd, paper thin, hollow product , which walks, talks and smells like a pilot for a TV series, the kind that gets canceled after one season.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lighthearted and human just like the Spiderman movies,"The trick to making a successful comic book movie, or any sci-fi/fantasy movie, is to bring out the human characteristics of the main characters in the limited time available. The books, of course, have a definite advantage in this area, since they are not backed by money-hungry producers who want to see nothing but action and marketable T-shirt quotes. Movies with one hero (Spiderman, Batman Begins) are able to play out the characterization at length without slowing down the movie. In Fantastic Four, there were actually five characters that viewers needed to get the ""feel"" of before the action started.I have to say that Tim Story pulled this off very well. I actually felt for Reed Richards in his naive but well-intentioned pursuit of scientific discovery for the good of mankind, as well as his not-so-well hidden regret about breaking up with Sue Storm. Ben Grimm, played by The Shield's Michael Chiklis, was fascinating as the loyal and tough friend of Reed's who deals with the majority of the angst that is involved in becoming a superhero. His depiction of The Thing, which is a lot more than just his voice, is superb.In my view, the only weak link in this chain, seems to be the villain, Dr. Doom. It wasn't that I was displeased with Julian McMahon's performance, I just think the Victor Von Doom, along with the villain that he became, deserved a little more explanation. In the F4 stories that I remember, Victor was much more multi-faceted than the greedy and excessively rude movie version. Perhaps if the movie had been longer, there would have been time to flesh out this character a bit more.Overall, this movie is fast and fun. It's safe for kids and entertaining for adults. The perfect summer movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastically Bad,"Fantastic Four I went to F4 expecting a bad movie, but what I got was even worse, the film is an inept attempt in the comic book genre.Tim Story for who knows what reason direct this highly anticipated movie, the result is a lack of focus and bland direction, focusing more on the jokes than anything else.The acting was nothing memorable, obviously almost everyone is miscast- ed here, are we really supposed to believe that this people are scientists?, because I didn't believe it at all, the only one that showed some strong acting was Michael Chiklis, his role is also the only one that its kind of developed.The script is full of one-liners and 'funny' moments that really add nothing to the film, the development of the characters is non-existent and the plot just flows because of the editing.The villain is underdeveloped, just there for the purpose of filling the 2 hours.The movie is way aimed to kids and teenagers, reminds me of the Power Rangers movie which is also of FOX.This doesn't compare with X-Men, Spider-Man and Batman Begins, its a shame to even be compare with that, it's actually worse that Daredevil and Hulk.I recommend you to watch the cartoons or read the comic book, they're better than this.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
WAY better than I expected,"My husband and I saw the movie tonight and I really enjoyed it. It was lots of fun and the acting was good. Yeah, so maybe the effects were not PERFECT but nothing ever is and I enjoyed it for what it was. Johnny Storm was by far the funnest character. Sue was believable. Reed was a nerd (as he should be.) Ben was done so well in terms of character development that I simply fell in love with him. Dr. Doom... he was just awesome! I think the storyline was a great intro into comic characters that are not necessarily household names. I can not WAIT until they make another one. It was just plain fun! Take your kids, this is a great family movie! It holds your attention without being too over the top or wordy.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
serviceable superhero flick,"I was never a big comic book kid; I would read them but usually it was that one or that one and I never had much allegiance to any particular hero. But I do recall a fondness for the Fantastic Four, I think mainly because I related to the angst-ridden Thing, being angst-ridden myself.I didn't find the movie as intriguing as I remember the comic books being, but it does a decent job in a rather generic fashion. It keeps moving, the story makes sense and it has some fun stuff in it. I would rank it above Spider-Man, which I thought was overrated, but below Spider-Man 2 or the first two X-men movies.I almost always enjoy superhero movies, so I enjoyed it, but it's not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I expect more from a comic book movie,"A good comic book movie is a movie you like even though you may have never heard of the superhero(s) or never particularly cared for them. A bad comic book movie is a movie you dislike even though you know the superhero(s) and you generally like the superhero(s). An OK comic book movie is a movie you are indifferent about after having seen it whether you knew the superhero(s) in it or not. Fantastic Four was OK as far as comic book movies go. I never followed Fantastic Four in the comic books, and I new very little about them; the movie helped me know them and their abilities a little better, which was good. The characters were not intriguing enough by themselves, so there needed to be some decent action as a filler. The action was not that impressive, nor was the final scene. The nemesis helps to make the movie just as much as the superheros. Movies such as Batman, Star Wars, Superman, Spiderman, etc. had excellent bad guys to compliment the good guys. The two need each other, and Dr. Doom just didn't come through.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Forget the bad reviews. Good summer movie.,"Folks, this isn't Shakespere. It is just an enjoyable summer movie. It was better than either Spiderman movies. But not as good as Batman Begins. I almost didn't go to this flick because of the negative reviews. Luckily my wife dragged me to the movie. The cast was very good, and this flick had a lot of humor and attitude. Michael Chiklis was wonderful as the Thing. I have a feeling the next movie will be even better. There's not a ton of action, but what's there is very well done. When I was a kid we never read any reviews. We just went to the movies and enjoyed ourselves. We miss a lot of good movies because we rely on some else's opinion. Of course that's just my opinion.

Enjoyable Summer Time Movie with a good future.,"I just finished seeing this movie and just had to post for all those who may have been scared off because of the negative reviews. I use and enjoy review sites such as Rotten Tomatoes, but they have it wrong this time. Don't worry, this is a fun movie; nice use of special effects that don't overload the movie with very good character interaction. Clean use of humor, and really catches the pathos of the Thing's dilemma, and what would you do if your body changed that way. I am a fan of comic books, and especially appreciate the good job of the new Batman and Spiderman franchises. While this is not as good as those (I think a more experienced action director is the difference) it is a good representation of the FF legacy (taking into account the normal updates and modifications.) No this is not a fake review; but, a review by someone who enjoys movies for what they are. All 3 theaters were full of families, teenagers and old codgers like me. At the end, a nice smile and round of applause from the audience. Lots of laughs and claps through the movie. Not academy award or super legend stuff, but a nice start to what is suppose to be a trilogy.Family friendly; action not bloody violence; Jessica for the teenagers, sexiness for the guys and strong character for the girls. Don't wait for the DVD, see it and talk about it with your friends. For you information, I liked the Spiderman movies, thought Dare Devil too dark as well as Elektra. The Hulk was just a bad movie, over reliance of CGI. This is a much better movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a Fantastic Failure...,"Watching a movie I semi-anticipated, Fantastic Four was one of Marvel's worst. We deal with repetitive situations, and everything was rushed faster than a McDonald's combo. It also had the same side effects; very sloppy, and not worth my money. The characters attitude's are very boring, and the Thing's strength changed consistently throughout the movie. Oh, one thing more...since when can just about anyone in a Marvel movie fall from a building, land, and just get up again? Also, if you enjoy using Photoshop, you and Stan Lee have something in common. Some of the effects were just awful.Overall, save your money for War of the Worlds. I haven't viewed it yet, so I'll see you there.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as goofy as I thought it would be...,"I must admit that my expectations were pretty low for this...but I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The Fantastic Four have always been annoying...in the comics, in the cartoons, and I expected the same for the movie, but they weren't.Johnny was of course his usual flippant self, but that's always been a part of his character. I was pretty satisfied with this movie, as the characters were pretty accurately portrayed, and it wasn't as cringe-worthy as the trailer depicted. The story flowed along pretty smoothly...no complaints here. Not to mention Jessica Alba ain't too hard on the eyes either!Not my favourite Marvel movie...but I am looking forward to the eventual sequel.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not so fantastic,"If you go to 1 movie this summer, don't let it be this one.When I went to see the Fantastic Four with a few friends of mine and I did not expect too much from it to begin with. The trailer wasn't promising much and the overload of marketing was making my spider senses tingle that there was something wrong with this movie.The first thing that I noticed was that the story is fast-paced, but in it's fast pace it just skips certain sub-plots that are started at the beginning. Furthermore, if you have seen any of the other superhero movies that have come out in the past years, you might as well skip this one, because it is nothing more than a summary of all clichés that you might expect from a superhero movie. It fails to surprise at any point. There is no sense of story or goal for our 'heroes' throughout the film witch leaves the only thing that is slightly entertaining (the relationship between 'the human torch' and 'the thing') to be the only story worth following.The scenario seems to be nothing more than an excuse for the stunt scenes that 'Johnny Storm' (Chris Evans) gets to preform. And if the effects or stunts were good or worthwhile this wouldn't be so bad. But the effects are a real stinker. Mr Fantastic is not made of rubber but on screen he is clearly made of pixels. The other effects seem dated and not exiting at all.Even worse than that, the acting is substandard: none of the actors seem to take their part seriously and I can hardly blame them with the story being as unbelievable and shaky as it is. The original material is partly to blame for this, but those 'other' superhero movies (Xmen 1 and 2) have proved that it is possible to make an unbelievable, slightly ridiculous story into one that is not only entertaining but also has some depth.And that is what I missed most in this movie. Any characters with real depth and believability.Miss this stinker of a movie and save your money for some the other excellent comic book adaptations that have come out this summer; Batman begins, Sin city, etc.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not bad, but not *Fantastic*","Fantastic Four - Five scientists go into space for some reason and get bombarded with gamma rays or something. I'd go into more depth, but the Fantastics weren't my favorites in the Marvel universe. First Off, I enjoyed The Thing (Micheal Chiklis)'s acting as he goes through the trials and tribulations of being covered in Kaptain Krunch cereal and being unable to hold a drink (could he get a straw or something?). I also liked Ioan Gruffudd's Mr. Fantastic character, and wish he was given more to do. Finally I liked Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom, even if it was mostly a psychotic super-powered rehash of his character on Nip/Tuck. That's not necessarily a bad thing. His sparingly used evil scenes were fun. As for the other two, Chris Evans was mostly really annoying at first, but he's grown on me. Jessica Alba was really whiny. She needs acting lessons, as there was little to nothing endearing about her character.Sidenote: The film's idea of keeping the team away from everyone and trying to undo their condition was kinda boring. The only time anything interesting really happened was when they left their H.Q.Some of the effects are better than others. Some of the Mr. Fantastic effects look like they were done on the cheap. Same goes for the Invisible Woman force fields. Maybe they can fix that in the sequel.The movie doesn't have a real story per se. It has moments and one liners. While that's not a terrible thing (The Thing threateningly telling kids not to do drugs was buckets of fun by itself), it keeps the movie from being anything other than adequate and being in the league of such comic book films as Spiderman, Superman, and Batman Begins. It is, however, in the league of fun no-brainer comic book films like Daredevil, The Punisher, and Darkman.Fun but hardly Fantastic, Fantastic gets a B-",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
... is this a great movie? NO!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OK, this movie is a hollow shell of the comic book, the movie changed everything, and in most cases not for the better. The movie had to make some changes, to keep up with modern times, but Reed and Doom were collage student together, there is a line where if you cross it the movie kinda gets weird. Most movie try to stay faithful to the original as possible, but this messes it up, big time! Maybe the fantastic 4 sequel, we all know ones coming people, will be like X-men and improve on the plot, the theme, the whole movie. the movie kinda upset me of how a movie that had so much potential could become such a disappointment... for shame. However if you don't know the story of the fantastic 4 you should see it, for Marvel fans you might want to wait a bit to pop some popcorn and rent this one. Also if you are a pervert, or a 13 year old boy, see it for Jessica alba. other than that Marvel fans steer clear.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A solid comic book film. ***1/2 out of 5,"Forget all the bad reviews you may have heard, I'm not sure what the critics were expecting. Not every comic book film can be a Spider-Man or Superman.Being that the film is about 4 central heroes I feel the film fleshes the characters out quite well. My disappointment was that there wasn't that much Dr. Doom in full form (he's rather weak when he's not). But this is a movie that tells us how the four became the Fantastic Four and that is more important at this point. We see the conflicts they have with one another and excepting what they have become. We will have plenty of Dr. Doom in the next installment.There is a great deal of humor and I felt it was essential to a comic book movie like this. It all worked quite well too. One of my favorite moments being when The Thing sees his very own action figure. ""It's clobberin' time!""It's good comic book fun and I highly recommend it. Can't wait for the sequel!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
With no high expectations you'll find -- while far from perfect -- F4 is still a fun movie,"Comic book movies have come a long way to being seen as serious action/adventure fare. The X-Men and Spider-Man series, as well as Batman Begins, helped to forge a seriousness in comic movies that has set a certain bar for achievement. However, The Fantastic Four seems to step back a bit to the more tongue-in-cheek method of crafting a comic book into a film. In doing so, it automatically handicapped its ability to create a realistic film, opting for a more fantasy based attitude. While the results aren't as disastrous as die-hard comic book movie fans suggest, they are not amazing either.The story follows two scientists -- Reed Richards and Ben Grimm -- in need of funding for a project to observe an energy cloud approaching Earth which they feel could explain human evolution. They are forced to approach a wealthy industrialist named Victor Von Doom, who happens to employ Richards former girlfriend Sue Storm, to use his orbiting space station to monitor the effects of the cloud. The scientists along with Sue's brother Johnny to pilot their spacecraft arrive at the space station to find their initial estimates of the cloud's arrive time to be off and they are bombarded by the cloud's energies.The five soon find themselves gaining strange abilities. Richards body becomes elasticized, giving him the ability to stretch to incredible lengths. Sue Storm finds herself with the ability to become invisible as well as create force fields. Johnny Storm gains the ability to burn at incredible temperatures and fly. Ben Grimm soon finds his entire body turned to rock. Von Doom finds himself slowly turning to an organic metal and gaining the ability to manipulate energy. Circumstances soon change finding Richards success taking off as Von Doom's company fails. This sets Von Doom off on a mission to turn the tables back in his favor.With several great action sequences, excellent effects work and superb casting of some very strong talent (including the always dynamic Michael Chiklis), the film is certainly enjoyable from an aesthetic point of view. However, with a fairly shallow storyline and dialog that often is wooden and jagged, it falls short of its comic book film contemporaries. Those walking in with heightened expectations of greatness along the lines of Batman Begins or Spider-Man 2 will certainly be disappointed by the Fantastic Four's more juvenile approach. However, if one keeps in mind that it is more popcorn entertainment than Oscar worthy landmark, the Fantastic Four still manages to be an enjoyable action/science-fiction movie as a whole.My rating: 6.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I give it a Fantastic 4...out of 10,"What a waste of 10 bucks. I didn't expect much from this movie and it did not disappoint. I was at least hoping for some cool fight scenes with all the powers if nothing else. Well guess what there wasn't really any fighting, except for the 5-10 minute thing at the end, which was fairly anti-climactic (in my opinion). In an age where it seems almost every other movie is based on a comic book this one is pretty weak. Especially compared to the vastly superior Batman Begins that came out this summer. In that movie there was an actual plot and the characters were much more defined. Here the characters were all 2D and there wasn't really a plot at all. I didn't buy 1)How they all became celebrity heroes after saving a few guys from a problem which was largely the Thing's doing. What was he doing on the bridge anyway? The writing wasn't really that good and while this movie wasn't painful to sit through, and was fairly short, it managed to be even more transparent then Jessica Alba. I guess the Special Effects were OK, but now adays when ever movie has special effects they don't seem as special as they did, say a decade ago when T2 and Jurrassic Park came out. If you want to see a comic book movie see Batman or rent one of the Spiderman or X-Men movies. If you want to see a boring pointless movie with almost no action go see Fantastic Four.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good (not great) addition to my Marvel movie collection.,"I am a fan of all superhero movies in general, of course there are a handful of them that I cannot be a fan of due to extreme poor quality. I'm happy to say that contrary to popular opinion, Fantastic Four is not one of those movies. It is a really good movie in its own way, perhaps it seems poor compared to Marvel's greats such as X-Men, Spider-Man 2 or The Avengers.For one thing, casting is good to great for the most part. I don't think a better Human Torch could've been chosen than Chris Evans, Chicklis is lovable and adorable but still tough in a goofy way just like The Thing is supposed to be. Gruffud and Alba are not great but decent adaptations of the comic characters. Julian McMahon is a great character, but he's NOT Doom. He is an interesting and cool character but he's nothing like the source material, but he's really the only instance of that in this movie.I liked the story, simple but sufficient. It's basically all five are exposed to radiation in space, which gives them all odd abilities. But then it shows all five of them progress as characters, they all have to deal with what they've become and choose what to use it for.Action is also great, for its time anyways. The climax was imaginative, interesting, and just really creative I loved it.In closing, yes perhaps the film was overly cheesy but that's how the original comic book characters were too. This movie is not great, but it is very good and not half as bad as it's made out to be. A heck of a lot better than the 2007 crap fest, which was a fun crap fest but still a crap fest.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Crappy Four, indeed","There's not much that gets me excited about the film once I stepped out of the theater. Maybe if I were a Fantastic Four comic follower then I might have more appreciation to the movie. But the thing is, I never were and this movie failed to convert me to be one.Perhaps it is a bad thing that I watched Batman Begins prior to FF. Batman Begins is almost flawless in every way that it sets such a high standard on any comic-book-to-movie adaptation from then on. Granted, Batman Begins and Fantastic 4 are much different in tone. Fantastic 4 is a ""light"" movie that you don't take it seriously (and you shouldn't, BTW). Unlike Batman Begins, You can even bring your young children to see FF without worrying about them getting scared in the theater.But despite their different tone, you can't help but expect the movie to be at least decent movie that makes you satisfied and excited when you talk about it with your friends on your way home. Unfortunately, it never happened. But that's about it. I never felt sympathy for any of the characters except ""The Thing"" and his inner struggles. The story is extremely campy and over-the-top. There are so many plot-holes and inconsistencies here and there. And I noticed there are even sound glitches and scene editing problems on the second-half of the movie. I know this is not ""Batman Begins"" caliber, but it certainly a below average movie with poor execution.Moreover, it is a pitiful indication that the movie relies so much on jokes, one-liners, flashy special effects and MTV generation lifestyle to cover up the lack of storyline and depth. Is this an indication of movie-making in the future? The director really needs to go back to the basics: STORYLINE, SCRIPT and other movie-making ""101."" I should have seen it coming. The marketing department spent millions of dollars to hype up Fantastic Four months before its release. We see FF advertisements on TV, websites, radios, movies, posters, electronics (Samsung) pretty much everyday and everywhere. You wonder if the reason they are doing that is because they know the movie sucks so much that the only way they can gain audience is by heavy marketing. Turn out it's true.So, word of advice: if you wanna watch good comic book movies, skip Fantastic Four. It's not one of them.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It may not be fully fantastic, but it deserves more than four stars out of 10.","Let's get this out of the way - ""Fantastic Four"" is not as good as the best superhero movie of the past few years. But then again, not even the ""Spider-Man"" movies are as good as ""The Incredibles,"" so that was only to be expected.I think the reason a number of people were predicting/hoping this would be the disaster of the summer (a mantle that at the time of writing seems to be assumed by ""The Island"" instead, which serves Michael Bay right for producing ""The Amityville Horror"") is that the movie was deliberately setting out to be not as Important as other Marvel/DC comic book movies of late - less brooding, more lightweight and enjoyable. That, and the strange casting in front of and behind the camera (Hornblower as Mr. Fantastic? Chris ""Not that one"" Evans as the Human Torch? The bloke from ""Nip/Tuck"" who used to go out with Dannii Minogue as Dr. Doom - though he's never referred to as such in the movie? And the multiracial and sexy-beyond-belief Jessica Alba as the very WASPy Sue? Even Alba fans objected to casting the latter as someone who is, after all, regularly invisible). And the fact that Simon Kinberg (who already has two strikes with ""xXx2"" and ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" - I don't care if that was a hit, I didn't like it) gave an ultimately uncredited hand to the script.And while it's true that the special effects sometimes aren't of ""The Lord of the Rings"" quality (the scene where the immodestly dubbed Mr. Fantastic falls down a building is distressingly cartoonish), that the movie isn't as effective with the love story between Reed, Susan and Victor Von Doom as with the Thing and the Human Torch, and that there aren't as many all-out action scenes as you could wish for - the battles don't come along until well into the movie - it does work when you take it on its own terms instead of expecting a dark, gritty origins movie. (Though let's face it, who expects doom and gloom from a movie executive produced by Chris Columbus?) Unlike ""Elektra,"" it's not ashamed to please its audience and has a healthy sense of humour about itself - so healthy that it almost becomes a bit camp, but only almost.With three appealing turns from our title quartet (only Ioan Gruffudd lets the side down as Reed Richards, not quite living up to his name of Mr. Fantastic; Michael Chiklis and especially Chris Evans have the most colourful roles and really bolster the movie when they're on, and though Jessica Alba has less scope in her role as the Invisible Woman she's nowhere near as lost as, say, Katie Holmes in ""Batman Begins""), attempts to infuse emotion into the story that keep your attention until the fights start, and a villain in Julian McMahon's Victor who at least has more going for him than the ones in - yes, again - ""Batman Begins,"" it's nothing more than a good, unambitious movie. The movie could have done without the songs over the credits though (John Ottman's score isn't Elfman or Williams, but at least he has a good old-fashioned heroic fanfare here), but that's hardly a major criticism. And be honest; would you rather have something that shoots relatively low and hits the target, or something that overreaches and dies?Then again, this is a movie that has Jessica Alba in Spandex. And materialising in her underwear. And saying things like ""It's been a good two years, Victor"" and ""We can only stay for one drink because I have to go and meet Victor."" Did you really think I was going to hate it? Did you really?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Gruesome Foursome.,"Five scientists in outer space are exposed to a mysterious form of cosmic radiation which alters their DNA makeups in various ways. One (Julian McMahon) becomes a madman and the others (Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis) become the titled superheroes who fight for truth, justice......and you know the rest. Disappointing entry for the genre that has a sorry story, old special effects and uneven characters. Alba and Gruffudd's past romance becomes tiring fast, Evans is a woman-crazed nut who takes his powers as a grain of salt and Chiklis is a depression-inducing character whose background and dilemma seem totally out of place in this picture. McMahon's power-crazed mega-billionaire provides flashes of interest, but the production's tone when dealing with him is so dark and disturbing that he too seems like he is in the wrong movie. DC Comics' 1960s invention was old and tired even back then because superheroes were nothing new. Hanna & Barbera's animated take on the comics were never anything noteworthy either and thus it becomes a bit of a mystery why anyone ever believed the premise would translate to the silver screen. I guess we are just going through another superhero movie surge in Hollywood right now. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

A light and entertaining comic book flick--- 7/10,"Fantastic Four is a perfect example of a what a PG-13 comic book movie based on a story that was meant to be fun and light-hearted should be. I caught this in theaters and i swear i had a great time. It's funny, has a great action sequence on the bridge, and a pretty decent villain. This is not a masterpiece, nor did it intend to be. It's good old fashioned fun at the movies. Remember those days?Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) steals the show with his clever one-liners and fire ""everywhere"". Especially funny when cracking on my other favorite Ben Grimm (Micheal Chiklis). Kudos to Chiklis for fighting to make the Thing in costume and make up instead of CGI. It paid off because the costume looks great and computer graphics would have crapified the whole flick. Just like they did with Mr. Fantastic's stretching ability which looks pretty damn horrible. Jessica Alba, on the other hand, is still smokin' hot. She was okay in the movie too.This is an underrated movie that is lots of fun to watch, so if you don't feel like getting confused, depressed, or bored, this is a fine alternative.--- 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not so Fantastic Four,"OK, before I begin I suggest that all the people who gave good reviews to Fantastic Four (FF) to sit down, have a coke and shut the f@*k up. This film is one of the worst films I've seen in my life, its way down there with Solaris. Where to begin with this one, there was so much junk, bad story lines and unbelievable coincidences it boggles the mind. The fat lady who lives next door could have directed a better film. Like The Thing's wife, there's all the boys (FF) out on the middle of the bridge saving the fire department from certain death and bad CGI. How did she manage to be front and centre for the whole giving back the ring scene? S. Storm had to strip down to get the others up front, why? and how?

Not exactly Fantastic: Goood movie in it's own little way.,"The acting was average, the writing was average, it was all just kind of average. Nothing great barely good with one too many jokes though some were a little funny. The movie wasn't all bad though, just tough to get into. It had a pretty good build up but not enough to keep the movie going. The only thing they really managed to do right is the interaction and feeling between the four, that and not make them decide to be heroes right on the spot.Spoiler warning!Another fan disappointment ""ABSOLUTELY NO ACTION!"" Maybe two scenes if you even count the Brooklyn bridge scene. Also Doctor Doom didn't seem to be very evil.

Disaster!,"Don't listen to all of the FAKE REVIEWS left by the studios trying to hype this film. Honestly, how many 10 star reviews can you give to a movie when you have no other reviews to your credit? IMDBers know better than to believe bogus reviews that so unbelievably over the top. For hyping this turd, you should be ashamed of yourselves. The story and dialogue are so lame it's insulting. Jessica Alba and Tim Story had no business being in this picture. This is no franchise, which is what they are obviously trying to create instead of trying to entertain us with a quality movie. I won't bore you with the details. They are more than enough bogus reviews to sift through that will tell you more than you to know (if you believe them.) Did I say that most of the reviews for this movie are bogus? It's not great, it's the next Catwoman. Spend your money on a quality movie like Batman instead of the boring 4.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic May Be Stretching It (Get It?) But These Films Are a Lot of Fun,"I'm used to being in the minority when it comes to movies. But usually, I hate movies that everyone else seems to love. It's much rarer that there will be a movie almost universally disliked, but which I actually enjoyed. ""Fantastic Four"" is one of those.Maybe by the time I saw this I was just sick of all the brooding, psychologically complex superheroes out there and found a good old-fashioned cheesy comic book movie refreshing. What I like about this story is that the Fantastic Four have their superpowers foisted on them, and then have to figure out how to use them. They have a regular Joe quality to them that makes them easier to relate to. They don't have sinister back stories full of murdered parents, ugly childhoods, seething feelings of revenge. They're just geeky scientists who can do pretty cool things.People seem to be responding to the second installment, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer,"" marginally better than they did the first, but I like both of them. After the overblown mess that was the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy and all of the dithery angst that filled Sam Raimi's ""Spiderman"" series, it's nice to sit back and let 90 minutes of fun, worry free action adventure cleanse the palate.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Craptastic 4,"I have just wasted nearly two hours of my life. What the hell was that crap? The plot, the acting.. Wait a minute, what plot, what acting? All heroes act illogical (except maybe for the fire dude) and irrational. And yeah right - Jessica Alba looks so much like a physicist! They even managed to make Chikliss look like he never acted before. Maybe i want too much from a movie based on a comic book, but look at x-men or batman - they're based on comic books but still watchable! (Not that i like x-men and batman very much).

"Not quite 'fantastic', but still very entertaining.","After being exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation during an accident on a space station, four scientists discover that their DNA has mutated, giving each of them a unique special power: Rex Reed becomes Mr. Fantastic, a man with an elastic body; Sue Storm finds that she can become invisible; her brother Johnny is a flying fireball called The Human Torch; and big, bald softy Ben Grimm turns into a huge hulking orange beast called The Thing. Together, they are the Fantastic Four.Unfortunately, their megalomanical boss, Victor Von Doom, who was also present during the accident, develops his own superpower: he can store electrical energy in his body and use it as a weapon. And, like all good super-villains, he plans to use his newfound ability to rule the worldMwa ha haaaaa!!!Having already watched the Rise of the Silver Surfer and been thoroughly underwhelmed by what I had seen, I nearly passed on viewing the first movie altogether. Thankfully, my wife convinced me to settle down and watch it with her, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that Fantastic Four is far superior to its sequel.Maybe it's the whole 'origin of' aspect to the film that I preferredgetting to see each character discover and master their new talents is a whole heap of fun. It's possible that this movie succeeds due to it's witty script, light-hearted approach, and well-defined villain (The Silver Surfer wasn't really 'evil', and his boss Galactus was a massive disappointment, being nothing more than a hungry space cloud). Or perhaps it's just the fact that there is more action and better special effects.Whatever the reason, I'd choose this film over the team's decidedly average second outing any day of the week.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Not exactly as ""Fantastic"" as anticipated","FANTASTIC FOUR (2005) **1/2 Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, Julian McMahon , Hamish Linklater, Kerry Washington, Laurie Holden, Maria Menounos. Less-than-stellar and barely 'fantastic' adaptation of the cult classic Marvel comic books quartet of reluctant superheroes (for the uninitiated : egghead scientist Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic (a wan Gruffudd); Sue Storm/The Invisible Girl, an astrophysicist (a seemingly miscast Alba  who don't get me wrong fills out her sleek costume nicely but I'd have been pleased with say Naomi Watts); her hot-headed brother/pilot Johnny Storm/The Human Torch (Evans, the only one clearly having fun with his new-found fame); and astronaut curmudgeon Ben Grimm/The Thing (Chiklis, the best of the bunch emoting under a ton of latex wonder) who gain their other-worldly powers in a freak accident in a cosmic quest to study DNA with fellow victim/financial backer and rival cum villain Victor Von Doom AKA Dr. Doom (McMahon relishing his role as the ultimate comics baddie) who has plans of his own for domination. The special effects are average in comparison to the recent crop of big-screen adaptation of comic book heroes but the screenplay by Michael France and Mark Frost is strenuously terrible with some truly awful dialogue that sound horrendous when delivered. Director Tim Story also seems out of his element in the big action sequences that could've added more juice to the storyline and the amazing characters (again Chiklis gets to shine even with the expert make-up by Bart Mixon) that has so much more potential that if a sequel is in the midst one hopes it'll be even more fantastic than this disappointment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It hasn't been a fantastic summer season, at least not for the movies. Does the trend continue?","It hasn't been a fantastic summer season, at least not for the movies. Not to say that there have been too many mediocre movies as opposed to good ones, quite the contrary. The big summer movies thus far (""Star War: Revenge of The Sith"", ""Batman Begins"" & ""War of The Worlds"") have pleased large sections of the audience but haven't had the universal appeal that truly merits them the summer crown. So is this the movie that finally deserves the title? Scheduling couldn't have been more kind to ""Fantastic Four"". It comes at a time when the all-important family audiences have been offered nothing but much darker and more adult fair and family movies that did not manage to seamlessly tap both the parent and the adolescent crowd (e.g. ""Madagascar""). That is not to say the comic book adaptation tries being brainy whether it be with how well the characters are written or the plot plays out. Nevertheless it does provide the necessary thrills and spills to keep both young and old entertained during its short 1 hour 45 minute runtime.For those who don't know the movie follows the exploits of four everyday human beings who are given extraordinary powers. In his quest to study a once in a lifetime cosmic event Reed Richards a/k/a Mr Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and his longtime buddy Ben Grimm aka The Thing (Michael Chiklis from the excellent TV show ""The Shield"") decide to a/k/a for financial assistance from the ever-scheming Victor Von Doom a/k/a Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon from another excellent TV show ""Nip/Tuck"" and the not so excellent ""Charmed""). In an instance Victor's current squeeze Sue Storm a/k/a The Invisible Girl (What?) (Played by the gorgeous Jessica Alba) and her immature brother Johnny Storm a/k/a The Human Torch (Chris Evans who's ""Cellular"" I've yet to catch) are added to the mix and we're off.Unlike many recent superhero outings writers Michael France & Mark Frost hurry up the proceedings and our heroes, and obligatory villain, are speedily given their powers. It's an enjoyable, if familiar, ride as we discover the characters individual strengths and weaknesses just as they do. We've seen it all before from Peter Parker's first web slinging episode to Matt Murdock's terrifying first sonar vision and subsequent martial arts training. Nonetheless I personally always find such scenes/montages entertaining and feel they're very informative to the large numbers in the audience who're meeting these fascinating characters for the first time.I'm not a frequent reader of the ""Fantastic Four"" title but from my little knowledge of the title I can safely say that they've tried to stick as closely to their origins as possible. The only victim is the character of Victor Von Doom. Fortunately, it isn't as bad as many had imagined. Making the ruthless tyrant from Latveria a Donald Trump type tycoon might not have gone down well with fans of the character but it plays out pretty well. Plus the obvious setup for a potential sequel indicates where we'll find Dr. Doom next. It's also enjoyable to see the famous sites such as the Baxter Building carefully replicated on screen.One of my greatest fears regarding this movie has always been The Thing's bodysuit and make-up effects. It just looked terribly bad in the early stills, trailers and promotional artwork. Although I would've loved to see a larger version of the character Michael Chiklis excellent performances helped me look past that. He really gets into the skin (every pun intended) of the character and truly owns the role.I was right about one thing though - the addition of Jessica Alba to the cast definitely had to do with trying to get horny 12 year olds in the cinema. It's so blatantly obvious from her body hugging, cleavage revealing getup to a random scene where she's made to strip on the pretext of turning invisible and sneaking past a crowd. Imaginative? Sure. But why go through all the hassle when both Reed and Johnny manage to sneak past the police barricade without resorting to such cheap tricks? Oh well, at least it gives the perverts out there another scene to screen cap (*cough*please e-mail me the link if you find it online...*cough*). I still don't think she fit the role and what's with the whole Invisible Girl thing? Maybe I remember it a little different but wasn't it always supposed to be ""woman""? If anything truly stands out like a sore thumb it has to be the by-the-numbers plot. You should truly leave your brain at the door as every scene can be predicted right from the offset. In place of it we get great scenes exploring the ""first family of comics"" aspect associated with F4. Director Tim Story could've easily gone with over-the-top special effects laden match-up (king of puns aren't I?) between The Human Torch and The Thing but instead decides to tackle it very much like a family dispute.The movie may not deserve the summer movie crown I mentioned earlier but it is a fun ride. If it wasn't for the been there, done that vibe one gets after stepping out from the cinema and the no-brainer plot it would have definitely bowled over the audience and critics alike. On the whole though it's a pleasant popcorn entertainer.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A tedious experience.,"The very indifferent way The Fantastic Four was put together indicates to me the makers were non-fans with very little interest in the subject. The script is littered with lame jokes which along with the rest of the boring and highly expository dialogue is delivered with very little conviction by the actors. The only participant who shows any interest or enthusiasm is FF creator Stan Lee who as per apparent tradition makes a brief cameo. Despite the fact there are four, not one but four (actually five including the villain), super-power endowed characters there is precious little spectacle. The story seems to go on endlessly from one boring scene to the next until in the last 5 minutes it abruptly changes it's tone from non-stop chitter chatter into the sort of spectacle I had long since grew tired and bored of waiting for. By then I was much too disinterested to care.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I found it great.. but I don't really follow the comic,"I saw this movie with the expectation of it being the horrible abomination of a movie that the Hulk unfortunately was. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it. I have heard that it doesn't hold true to the comic too much but since I don't read FF I didn't care that much. The acting was cool. I thought that it was nice to see Hornblower (reed) in a bigger role than I am used to seeing him in. The thing was great. The actor did it well and the fact that he was not done with CG really earned respect from me. To be frank I thought the final fight was a bit lacking in Entertainment but that is just an opinion. Over all I give it a 7 and from what I experienced and hear.. if you like the comics don't go see it, but if you never read the comics it should be a good experience for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Early era superhero film,"Fantastic Four has its good points - there are individual scenes that work and the special effects are variable, but all four of the superheroes are rendered effectively. There's a nice sense of teamwork in the final battle, and it contains moments of surprise and excitement. Too bad that it comes too quickly and with too little build-up. Fantastic Four is frustrating because it doesn't seem far removed from a wholly enjoyable motion picture, but the tempo's off, beats are missed, and the production ends up sounding out-of-tune. The actors are all good except Jessica Alba who seems a bit wooden. Fantastic 4 was made before he deluge of Superhero films. Watch it just to reminiscence of the good ole days.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A decent filmgoing experience,"The Fantastic Four will win no awards. It has a lot of flaws which include too little action and an ending that was over much too quickly. Jessica Alba, though very attractive, does not act well in this film, but the other three, especially Chiklis and Evans, do well enough.In the script, Tim story captured a lot of what made the comic so charming. One thing was the way the four always fought among each other, almost as much as they fought their enemies. He also went for comedy more so then sincerity, and it works for the most part. If marvel fans remember the comic, they will notice these scenes and get a chuckle out of them. The Human Torch was always a prankster, and he always teased the Thing. They were the two that fought one another most of the time as well, and you will see that clearly with this film.A lot of people who have given this movie bad reviews probably never read the comic. I just can't understand all the hate that this movie is getting even though it is much better than War of The Worlds, a film that many people seemed to like, but I found to be rather dull and boring. True the special effects could've been better, but Tim Story did not have the budget that Steven Spielberg was given, so I can forgive him that.Overall I would say that Fantastic Four should've been a little more serious than it was. There were entirely too many jokes and not enough science that could've made it better. I didn't quite accept how they changed Doom's origins from the comic, but it didn't bother me too much. Fantastic Four, to me, was just light hearted fun, and it is not on the same par as Spiderman 2, Superman 1 and 2, or X-men 2. However, it was a whole lot better than The Hulk and Daredevil, and in my opinion better than the first X-men movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastically Abominable,"I walked out of this movie, and I didn't even have to pay to see it. I walked out of a free sneak peak because this movie REALLY is THAT bad. It is so bad, it shouldn't be allowed to be shown to anyone.So, where do I start? I believe that most comic book (and fantasy) movies need a STRONG villain to really take off. This comic book has a great one, and so my hopes were high. However, they miscast Doom, and the character was nothing more than a joke. The acting all around was wooden, there was NO PLOT WHATSOEVER! I was amazed at the ridiculous editing and sound of the movie, not to mention a score that will haunt my nightmares.And it isn't even that this movie is bad compared to excellent comic book movies (and great MOVIES too, in my opinion) like the two Spider-Mans and Batman Begins. No, this movie is bad on its own, even though it IS laughable that this movie could come out less than a month after Batman and try to win the same audience.So, to any who have had delusions about paying for this movie (ever in the theaters, to rent, or to own on DVD) DON'T DO IT! Just spend the time (just under 2 hrs?) bashing your head into the wall, and listening to someone scratch their nails against a chalk board. . And afterward, I'm sure you'd be able to give a review on Fantastic 4 just as accurate as mine, based on your experience alone.PLEASE DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!

Nip/tuck guy was OK, but I'm just not a huge fan. The others were stiff.

Ignore the Reviews,"If you're going to a superhero movie to see intense drama and brilliant character development, get over it.

However, if you want to see a visual reenactment of a comic book series that features outstanding action and characters that don't take themselves too seriously, this is a good film. There are several things that differentiate the Fantastic Four from other comic book superheroes. The first is that they don't wear masks or have hidden secret identities...they are who they are. Another key differentiator is that they rarely work alone, choosing instead to combine their powers into a super team...sort of like the New England Patriots. Actually, this is a good lesson for teams of all kinds, that each member has strengths that can be drawn upon for the success of the team. This movie depicts these differences and has fun doing so.

Fantastic Four is near perfect on every level.,"Movies as good as this one deserves a rating of higher then 6 stars. It's completely flawless and packed with intelligent fun. Crisp action structured around great character development make this movie one that Hollywood should try and copy for years to come. I just wish that those idiots that made Batman Begins the dull waste of film that it is would've had a chance to study a movie like this before churning out their absurd effort at a sequel/prequel/relaunch.The Fantastic Four is near perfect on every level. It is tight and lean and superbly done. The action is second to none and some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed- What the Human Torch does as that missle draws down on him is remarkable! Ioan Gruffudd could be the next Mel Gibson. Jessica Alba has a huge role and brings a level of emotion to the movie (not to mention sexuality) that summer blockbusters rarely have. You knew Michael Chiklis would be excellent and hearing those classic words. ""IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME"" never sounded so good. The cast certainly didn't disappoint.

"""Prepare for the fantastic""","A group of astronauts gain superpowers after a cosmic radiation exposure and must use them to oppose the plans of their enemy, Doctor Victor Von Doom.Or should I say prepare for the not-so fantastic. Fantastic 4 is a really good premise from the first point, it combines every kind of thing a superhero movie would need. And the overall plot is pretty cool too. But the result is a terribly cheesy almost stupid outcome. I really did like the buildup and how we will see the team at the end. But seriously, I think everybody shouldn't take this film so seriously. The director was looking for a pure fun popcorn-flick, not Spiderman. Fantastic 4 combines all elements to create a fun film, and it does it in a almost childish way. I suspected somewhat more, but the final product wasn't as bad as everybody has been saying.

A light simple fun and entertaining popcorn movie,"It has concerned me greatly to see how many accredited and professional critics have reviewed this movie with so much harsh and negative words. When I went to see this movie, thinking that it would be a weak entry or worse a poor movie, I was surprised to find out how wrong the critics were. It was as if Hollywood had marked this movie for death and sent our the word, ""destroy this movie"". The reviews have been unrealistic and uncalled for.Now is this movie perfect, no. Is it a bob or a bad movie, no. I would compare it to first, the first X-Men movie. It too was simple in plot, had a modest pace and a lighter less complex approach to characters. It had a good final showdown with the apparent bad guy. It was a short film compared to the current lengths. It also compares to the first Spider-Man film in that it was lighter in tone than say films such as Batman Begins and X-Men II.Fantastic Four never takes itself too seriously, but does stay on a moderate track for a family film as drama goes. It will please adults that are not bent on dark twisted character driven plot lines. After all this is a normal set of characters that did not have their uncle murdered or there wife and children wiped out by some villain. They were changed into there super powered state by mere chance. They are now normal people coping with super powers and public stardom. Most of the movie moves from one stage to the next setting up mild drama and humor, moving the plot towards the finally.So far I have observed, from the so called true professional critics in Hollywood, that most of the poor reviews, some of which are bold attempts to trash a film that is far from as bad as they hope people will think it is, are personally or Hollywood motivated.You don't have to take my word for it. This was a fun entertaining family film (goodness forbid that we have a fun entertaining family film). It works well from that point of view. Just go see this after you read the reviews, say from a review service that collects all the syndicated reviews for movies. Then sit down, relax, get that pop corn out and watch a fun and entertaining movie that does not require you to see a shrink after you are done. I promise you, this will be a nice change that you will enjoy. You will say, that was not what the reviews said it would be, that was fun. What was their problem?Don't be fooled by the critics.

A good movie with flaws.,"Well, I just saw the Fantastic 4 the other day and I have to say it's a pretty good movie even though my expectations were higher than what the film presented. Michael Chiklis steals the show as Thing, but everyone else does a decent job of acting. The special effects in this movie are something to be seen. I had no idea that we could do some of the things that we do with computers. It's more visually stunning than the film itself is. I think the biggest problem with this film is that it has too much comedy in it. Another problem that I had was the score. I think they should have gotten Danny Elfman to do the music for this movie. Don't get me wrong though, this is a good movie. I'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out. I had a lot of fun watching it. It just had a few flaws here and there.

From the outset, we recognize two things as true: 1) we had never heard of what apparently is a comic book series of the same name, and 2) based on trailers, knew it would be a 90 minute release from brain function.Beyond a relatively shallow (but expected) story, one can easily dissect the characteristics of each major character role. Victor has always been second-best; hence, his overgrown ego. Sue is a stereotypical shallow ""Barbie-type."" I suspect young males (obviously the target audience) might find her physically attractive, though we certainly find her facially unappealing. Richard is entrapped in his career, and has difficulty connecting with life outside the lab. Johnny (Sue's brother) is a perpetually 12 year old boy - totally irresponsible and shallow. This is also a most unfortunate-looking person from the neck up.The only seemingly ""normal"" character was Ben. We were struck by his plainness - his simple persona - his love for a significant other. It was also great to see Michael Chiklis again, though this film and role were beneath him. We agree that he probably chose to do it as a professional lark or to do someone a favor.Special effects and graphics were, overall, pretty good. Some select items (photos, for example) we're obviously contrived. Of course, one cannot be too hard on a movie that should not be taken seriously; after all, it's an electronic comic book.There were some amusing parts of the film, and that's always a good thing. For spending $13.00 (tickets, popcorn and soda) for 2 adults, I believe we got our money's worth. Do see the film if you 1) follow the comic books OR 2) enjoy action-type films OR 3) just want to escape from the world for 90 minutes and not use your brain. It's kind of a fun trip.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Adequate Fan Film,"I loved the Fantastic Four Comic Book as a kid, but I never felt that their origin story really measured up to many of Marvel's Silver Age origins. So, I was a little surprised when I started seeing trailers for this film and it became apparent that the Fantastic Four would follow the origin-story formula for the franchise's first film. I was also a little concerned, and approached the film with low expectations. The film exceeded my expectations, but just barely. It was entertaining, though surprisingly violent considering that the original comic upon which it was based was more in the line of traditional pre-teen/teen oriented fiction than, for example, the X-Men.Four astronauts working with a somewhat shady ex-colleague in a private experimental venture are exposed to a radioactive cosmic storm which causes each of them to have different mutagenic reactions. Reed Richards become capable of morphing himself into virtually any shape and seemingly indestructible. Ben Grimm becomes rock-hard and incredibly strong. Johnny Blaze develops the ability to control flame and fly, and Susan Storm becomes telekinetic, and can rearrange air molecules to become invisible and to project a shield around herself and others. The storm also has an effect on Susan Storm's boss and boyfriend - the shady ex-colleague - affecting both his business credibility and his body, but to discuss this further would involve a spoiler.The film depicts the origin and personalities of the Fantastic Four in a manner which is fairly consistent with the Marvel Comic. I was particularly pleased with the casting and writing for Ben Grimm, who is, in my opinion, the most sympathetic of the group. The second half of the film shows them discovering what they can do with their new powers and sets up the emotional turmoil which will characterize the relationships between the four and their adversaries throughout many of their adventures - doing a particularly nice job of depicting Ben's feelings of loss and his reasons for them. The directing is fine, and the special effects are about as good as they could be (though they literally stretch believability quite often).The talented Mark Frost headed the writing team, which helps to explain why the dialog, pace and plotting were consistently above WGA's usual performance.All considered, the film does a reasonably good job within the limitations of the original material, which are several. Part of the problem with this material is that it fails to develop a main plot - in the form of a major adversarial relationship - until about 3/4ths of the way through the film. And that main plot is, therefore, subordinated to origin stories and characterization. How the franchise does will, therefore, largely depend on how effectively it uses the characterization in the first film to devise stronger plot devices in the succeeding films.I have greater trepidations about the second film - mainly because it involves one of Marvel's greatest story lines, and I have not, therefore, rushed to see the Silver Surfer. With the origin story out of the way and the characters built, and great material to work with, the second film ought to be an improvement.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A total sellout hack job...,"Everything about it was one-dimensional and campy. In fact, certain scenes seem to exist only for product placement courtesy of Pepsi and Espn. The movie lacks any realism or complexity whatsoever and is rather more like a cartoon adaptation that usually goes straight to video. I never saw Catwoman, but this is the worst adaptation of a comic I've seen.I totally don't understand the positive reviews I see posted on here. They have to be from the studio, because they sound like targeted reviews meant to appeal to certain tastes. There is just no way people could have found this movie that good.It's a stinker and completely unremarkable.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun For Everyone,"Okay, I'm going start out first saying, I don't read comic books. However, between X-Men and Fantastic Four, I'm completely into the story lines now. I don't understand how people can hate it. Everyone is comparing it to Spiderman. I don't know why, because Spiderman was so boring that I fell asleep. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even if the Human Torch bugged me a bit. It was a fun movie, especially for someone who has never really had interest in comic books. I guess all those comic junkies just have high expectations. Ah well.The action sequences were fun and despite the PG-13 rating, they didn't seem to ""traumatize"" my 4 year old daughter. (Which is good, because I received a lot of flak for taking her to a PG-13 movie LOL).In short, I'm really glad she begged me to see it, because I was a little skeptical at first, but I completely felt for the characters. Especially Ben. Not every movie has that one guy/gal you just feel so bad for. Well, some of them try, but sometimes they just come off as annoying. But not this movie, it had just about everything I want in a movie. Even cute guys (not Johnny, Ben LOL) and a little romance. (But if you tell anyone I like romance, I'll clobber you!) ;)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Light,"""Fantastic Four"" felt like it lacked a bit, but it was still a good movie. Many people are saying it's total crap, which I don't agree with. I liked it well enough.This movie felt lighter and fluffier than most of the superhero movies that have come out within the last few years. It was sort of like a beginner's superhero flick; it's about the right weight for a child. (That ""can he stretch any part of his body"" thing is a different story.) It had less brooding darkness and doom and more humor. People fond of ""Batman Begins,"" etc. may not be so fond of that, but I found it charming.It's well-acted, in my opinion, and the effects are fairly good. The writing feels unoriginal, and the jokes, while not cliché, seem kind of obvious, but not cheesy per se. The biggest problem was the final showdown, which likely took all of two minutes and was quite the anticlimax. It's no more than a mild scruff, and we needed to see the characters do MORE than they did. They deserve it - the whole movie's been building up to getting to see them whoop some butt big time!Pretty much the two characters they screwed up are Johnny Storm, aka The Human Torch, and Dr. Doom. Johnny is really one-dimensional and annoyingly scripted up until the very end, when he becomes dully two-dimensional and only sort of annoyingly scripted. But they completely wasted Dr. Doom. First, it took the whole dang movie to make him go from Victor Von Doom to Dr. Doom (he should have put on that mask an hour earlier), and then he's finished in that little blip of a final battle. I have never read the comics, but from what I hear he's one of the baddest of the baddies. You wouldn't know that from the film. However, this isn't entirely a bad thing for those Julian McMahon lovers, except it means all the more drool they're gonna get all over themselves.Still, despite its downsides, I can't completely slam ""Fantastic Four"" without feeling like a wretch. To be honest, I find it sort of cute in its lightness. Not to mention it has a fair amount of eye candy. :)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the better comics adaptations,"After reading the 'professional' reviews I went to see Fantastic Four with some trepidation, but the film is much better than many of these reviews would lead you to believe. The casting for the FF themselves was spot-on, and the film develops their personalities and relationships brilliantly. This is also the film's only real flaw - although the scenes showing how the Four adapt to their new-found powers and how they relate to each other are enjoyable, too much time is spent on this and not enough on developing the adventure itself. Victor von Doom's transformation to the evil Dr Doom is done fairly well, but Doom himself doesn't really come across as the towering evil genius you expect from the comics. There is none of the egomaniacal posturing or the grand ""Who dares to challenge the magnificence of Doom?"" type lines we've all come to know and love from the comic books. Overall, though, the film was a pleasant surprise and well worth watching for anyone who has read the comics. For anyone who hasn't but who has the capacity to return to their childhood for a couple of hours, this is a good introduction to some clean, comic book fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Had the Makings of a Great Movie,"The movie had plenty of eye candy. In some of the scenes the special effects were blended so well into the story that you did not think about it (those are the best kind of effects). I especially like the thing, because it was not CGI (was it?) and I kept wondering, ""how did they do that?"" The movie should get extra points just for that.The movie did not drag and had some humor too. Johnny Storm was my favorite, the actor that played him was perfectly cast. He energized every scene he was in and some of his one liners were really funny! The movie did stay true to the comic book. I mean, come on were we expecting Shakespeare?! I always thought of the Fantastic Four as the lighter side of DC Comics, especially when you compare these characters with Batman or Wolverine for example.If you like action, eye candy, and humor, with a little villainy thrown in, check it out!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Besides Special Effects !,"The movie manages to contain every marvel aspect...the told and untold,the fiction,the reality,everything is WYSIWYG (for the ones that know).i must say that i've given this movie a lower grade that deserved but just so maybe my comment will get seen.It is probably not the best movie this summer but nice to see on the screen unfamiliar faces.and of course that big question..""when is the sequel?"" i like sequel movies,but how can we ""upgrade"" if every time the sequels fail..most of the 2nd parts of good movies are done just for the money..let's hope this one won't fit the pattern.Cheers everyone and enjoy quality effects,not so nice lines and a lot of Fantastic 4.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,"And I don't say that lightly. I'm usually reasonably entertained by most movies. But this was so bad i really can't believe it. Some questions to those who are giving it ten out of tens:1- What is the plot of this movie? 2- What is the point of anything that happens in it? 3- Detail the motivations of any of the characters in this movie: 4- What is the villain doing at the finale, and why? 5- Really, please tell me what you liked about this film, and how you though it was superior to other films you've seen ( or do you give every movie a ten? )I could answer all of the above about Batman Begins easily and specifically. Before the responders close in on that, no, this didn't need to be grim, or serious, I could answer the questions above about Spider-Man also, heck, i could probably even stretch and answer them about the first Charlie's Angels movie. I could certainly answer them regarding the Incredibles.This movie was a failure on almost every level. Who was given the hundreds of millions to make this? They should never be allowed to make another film of this magnitude. Worse, who approved giving the money? It was even worse than Hulk and Daredevil. Please answer all the questions above if you're going to respond, rather than commenting on batman, spider-man, charlie's angels, incredibles , hulk or daredevil.I'm not commenting to rain on anyone's parade, i just don't understand how there are almost a thousand out there who gave it a ten out of ten.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very good film recreation of a comic !,"I knew what I was going to see when I went to the theater several weeks ago. And it didn't disappoint me at all. Unlike Shyamalan's Unbreakable, this film assumes that it's just a comic and everything happens like it does in them. The spirit of the comic was very well captured, the special effects are pretty good, and the film as a whole is entertaining. The ending is perfect for a sequel: It lets you waiting for the next one. I'm sure there will be Fantastic Four II, III, IV and even more.I'm not a comic fan, but I liked this movie. More than Batman Begins (2005) although less than Superman.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Von Doomed from the start,"Back in the 80s, when I was just a wee tot, I loved Marvel comic books. In my rotating spindle of Marvel favorites was Fantastic Four. Although the characters had stupid names (like most Marvel characters) and rather obvious personality traits, I frequently enjoyed reading about the fab foursomes' big adventures. Today, almost twenty years later, I found myself wading through the previews to see my old favorites take a stab at the silver screen.The movie starts out pretty much the way it had to: scientist seeks information; scientist goes into outer space to find it; scientist gets roasted by cosmic, er, rays; scientist acquires cool new powers. The scientist is Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), and he brings along Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), her brash brother Johnny (Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), and the inimitable Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). Also along for the ride are Jessica Alba's boobsbut more on them laterand then a few more times after that.Once the group arrives back from their cosmic ray encounter, they all soon develop their new powers. Reed can stretch his body to pick up falling glassware, Johnny can light himself on fire and brag about it, Ben is permanently transformed into a large rock (with matching rock organs), Sue can show her boobs at super-human frame-rates, and Vic Doom can become the worst, most uninspired actor our generation has ever seen. In fact, Julian McMahon's performance alone is bad enough to significantly lower the rating of this movie. After his investors pull out on him due to the botched space mission and Reed starts giving Susie (Doom's sought-after tail) the old elastic stallion, Doom becomes angry. To show how angry he is, he begins killing anyone he comes in contact with, including his exshareholders, his doctor, and even his doorman, by siphoning the power of metal and turning it into electrical kill waves...or something. Deviating from the comic book, Doom finds himself literally turning into metal and does what anyone would do in that situation: forge a metal mask to put over his already galvanizing face? That would be like a vampire buying a pair of fake vampire teeth to wear over his real vampire teeth.Meanwhile, Ben Grimm is depressed because his girlfriend Debbie (Laurie Holden) finds him hideous and terrifying yet battles her way (somehow) through a mob of police, fireman, and countless burning vehicles to give her exstud back his engagement ring. If she was so repulsed and terrified of the newly transformed Grimm, why wouldn't she just mail the ring back to him? And why did she look so angry when overdramatically placing the ring on the ground? It's not like Grimm turned into a big rock in order to ruffle her feathers; in your face, future! Grimm eventually finds solace in Alicia Masters, a hot blind chick (right) who falls for his craggy exterior.Johnny Storm is young, brazen, and driven for fame and fortune. Evans does a good job with the character and uses his energy and chiseled physique to squeeze out a few laughs and gasps throughout the movie. More impressive than Evan's portrayal of Johnny Storm was his chemistry with Chiklis. If he wasn't playing some amusing practical joke on the big lug, he was finding some other way to harass his mammoth buddy. Unfortunately for the rest of the movie, that's where the chemistry stops.Reed and Sue were one of Marvel's alltime couples, two people madly in love with each other. Sadly, Alba and Gruffudd show all the chemistry of chunky peanutbutter and rotting salmon. In her pursuit to get Reed to notice her breasts, she comes off as cloying and clingy throughout the entire movie. Gruffudd's conservative motivation to portray Reed Richards as a nerd more focused on his books than on Sue's torso comes off as far too understated and caused my attentionspan to shrivel like a tulip in a steamroom.In case you haven't heardit's trueJessica Alba has nice boobs, an attribute she's been directed to shove in our collective corneas every possible second of this film. ""Sue, go invisible to get through the crowd!"" orders Reed in the first of many action sequences. Off come Alba's blouse and pants. Conveniently for those in the audience obsessed with Alba's knockers, Sue hasn't yet gotten a firm grip on her big, juicy, voluptuous powers, so she tends to fade in and out of invisibility. Yes, there are her boobs againthis time in Lingerie! I didn't mind seeing the boobs once in a while (who wouldn't), but at a certain point, I felt that the director was using her tits as anchors for our drifting attention spans. Yes Tim Story, I'm talking to you. If you had more confidence in your own directorial skills, you wouldn't feel the compulsive need to tuck everyone inside of Alba's cleavage nook every 3.4 seconds.Like most of these comic-to-movie translations, I think the Fantastic Four plot line could have been much darker. For every positive point Chiklis and Evans added to the movie, the rest of the cast more than took away. Victor Von Doom, in theory, made a good villainous choice for the film. It's just a damned shame that McMahon carried the role like a leper in a juggling contest. So, is this movie worth 106 minutes of your life? Maybe it is depending on how you look at it. The matinée show will cost you around six dollars. Some simple math tells us that runtime (106 minutes) divided by cost (six dollars) gives us 17.6666667, or the number of times we need to see Alba's breasts for this movie to be worth it. Though I didn't have the foresight to record the occurrences of her extremities, I'd bet that she hit that number easily. Yet, there's another way of looking at this simple quandary: the film is average at best and should simply be avoided.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Entertaining, if not outstanding","FANTASTIC FOUR is a mildly entertaining version of the famous comics by Marvel. This movie deals basically with how the FANTASTIC FOUR became the super heroes they are, so a great deal of time is spent in the set up of the characters. We find out that Reed Richards is trying to convince old high school buddy turned big shot impresario Victor Von Doom about a space program. Reed's former flame, Susan Storm, now works with Von Doom AND is dating him. The setting up of Doom as the FANTASTIC FOUR's arch nemesis is a bit non convincing; there is nothing particularly menacing about him and his so called ""revenge"" motives are (at least to me) stupidly unfounded. Needless to say, the space mission with Reed, Susan, Johnny Storm, Ben(Reed's partner)and Von Doom turns out very wrong and upon arrival to earth, everyone's genetic structure is changed. Johnny Storm, Susan's kid brother, is believable enough as the cocky ""human torch"". Ben is forever physically altered, Richards' becomes an elastic being and Susan can become invisible and create force fields at the cost of great physical stress. Victor Von Doom's alteration is somewhat confusing; we never really know what ARE his genetically altered powers. Von Doom holds an intense grudge against Richards for making the mission a failure, stealing his girl and for his financial crumbling but ever since the movie started it seems that Von Doom was only waiting for something like this to happen only to be truly mad at Reed Richards. The rest of the movie moves along at a nice pace but there's nothing gripping about it. SPIDER MAN 2 has way more drama and X-MEN looks even more ""adult"" oriented than FANTASTIC FOUR. It seems the makers of this movie fought hard to make this a truly ""kiddy"" movie. It's ironic to remember that both, the comics AND the TV Cartoons depicted more a more mature version of the FANTASTIC FOUR. In the TV series, Reed looked more like a early forties man... kind of like a George Clooney type of guy. The casting will make many a fan cringe, despite the fact that all actors did OK with their roles. No matter how beautiful Jessica Alba is, she is probably the last person I would cast as Susan Storm. Johnny Storm and ""the thing"" were cast OK. Reed Richards could have been someone else and also Victor Von Doom, as they really don't look the part. Another thing that would have been nice to be included in this movie would be the TV series theme song. After all, SPIDERMAN included it some way into the film. The TV series intense, jazzy flavored theme song would have been very welcomed by yours truly. Only the frantic bass line of that original theme song was somehow spliced into this movie's original score. All in all, FANTASTIC FOUR was nice eye candy and nice movie to watch, but it's also a movie that begs for a superior sequel (a la SPIDERMAN or X-MEN)and better story.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four (2005) ***,"Intending to study cosmic rays, scientist Reed Richards blasts off into space along with his companions Ben Grimm, Johnny Storm, Johnny's sister Susan, and a rich but nasty industrialist called Victor Von Doom, who has financed the experiment. They meet terrible fates when they are tragically bathed in the rays, and as a result are endowed with different special powers... Reed is able to stretch his body indefinitely; Johnny can turn himself into a flying human torch; Susan becomes able to make herself transparent, and unfortunate palooka Ben Grimm is turned into an over-sized hulking monster consisting of orange-ish rocks. Victor Von Doom's body gradually begins to transform into metal, and he becomes the infamous villain ""Dr. Doom"", now out to destroy the ""Fantastic Four"" (as named by the media).This is not a pretentious or heavy-handed concept; this is a comic book story first and foremost, with the added quality of having characters we can get somewhat involved in. The film chooses to center itself more on the origin of these unusual characters and how their unnatural transformations are affecting them, and that's fine by me. Nowhere does this work better than through the sad and pitiful characterization of poor Ben Grimm, alias The Thing (perfectly played by Michael Chiklis), who gains our sympathy and delights us with the clumsiness and despair of his unwanted predicament. He has our hearts in his hard, bulky, four-fingered hands. He can also be funny as he constantly gets teased by Johnny Storm, who's always trying to get the best of the poor misfit. This was my very favorite element of the film, and it was in perfect harmony with the original comic book. I liked that the Thing's look was achieved through an actual body costume, rather than needless CGI, which didn't help the lousy HULK movie.Johnny the ""Human Torch"" can not only be antagonizing to gullible Ben Grimm, but equally annoying to us as well with his boyish and gung-ho eagerness to accept his fiery new persona a bit too readily. But I suppose this helps bring some contrast to the proceedings, as Reed Richards as the rubber-man is kind of bland, and Sue Storm doesn't get to do much when she's not stripping down to become invisible (she's played by the ultra-attractive Jessica Alba, who's decent enough in the role, by the way).Not a great film, but a good one - and certainly enjoyable enough for a Marvel Comics fantasy. It would be nice to see a sequel now that the beginnings and problems of the lead characters have been effectively dealt with. I'd love to see Michael Chiklis climb into that Thing costume at least once more as he yells: ""It's Clobberin' Time!"" *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as bad as critics suggest,"I'm glad I still went to see it. I enjoyed it.I agree with the critics on many points. The pace was uneven, some of the storyline flawed, etc. Yet, I thought it followed most of the FF comic feeling, pace, and level of action. The casting was good too. The Torch and the Thing were the best. Jessica Alba did great as S. Storm. Grufford played Richards as I would think he had to be played, a brilliant mono-cerebral person having a tough time dealing with the changes. I did not like the Dr. Doom story arc. First it was too much like the Spiderman's Goblin stuff.OK, it was not the WhaleRider (one of my best) or Batman Begins, but at least it was not a Van Helsing or Devil Boy (or whatever it was called).To me the FF movie will be more memorable then the War of the Worlds remake and even Batman Begins, though the quality of these two was much higher.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I've thought about it  and this is the worst movie I've ever seen!,"In all my years of watching movies in theaters I have never had a stronger urge to walk out of a movie. I really wanted to like this movie, the previews were dumb but I still felt that it was going to be amazing, I was very disappointed. This movie was painful to sit through, and the horrible jokes that you see in the previews (""Ooh,you're hot"" ""Thank you so are you"") are in the movie the entire time and get much worse than the line above. Almost everything about this movie was laughable it is such mindless humor. The special effects are also not very good and the acting (even though there are very talented actors here) is also terrible. And I have such strong tolerance for movies, I liked From Justin to Kelly! Elektra was better than this, I need to go watch X-Men now. Please don't waste your money on this, we can't have these kinds of superhero movies around!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Damn the critics!,"Of course i was ready to be disappointed after reading every critics in US harshly bashing this movie and all of the people involved in it - and of course i really should thank these so-called critics since i was pleasantly surprised with the result. F4 is OK, better than just OK; it's enjoyable - it has the simple clear fun comic book feeling of their creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby back in the 60's. and for me it was almost more than i hoped for in the first place. F4 is one of the best comic book adaptation so far. Only X MEN 2 and BATMAN RETURNS are superior, OK far superior; F4 is as good as X MEN and SPIDERMAN 2 and inches away above SPIDERMAN and BATMAN BEGINS. And please don't bother compare with DAREDEVIL, HULK or worse again ELEKTRA, CATWOMAN, THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, SUPERMAN (yes, not all of the movies from the 70's were masterpieces), SPAWN or THE PUNISHER as there are some of the worst movies ever made in any genre. I can understand that both critics and fans were dubious when heard about the chosen director of this project. Tim Story is no Bryan Singer,Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan or even Joel Schumacher (sic!); he was in fact the director of 2 terrible idiotic movies. and Jessica Alba is no Michelle Pfeiffer or Halle Berry, Julian Mac Nahon is no Ian Mac Kellen, Ioan gruffud is no Patrick Stewart, Chris Evans is no Alan Cumming... i could go on and on with the different names attached to the project. But finally everyone involved did their job and they did a good job. The director is not as talented as Bryan Singer (he did such a wonderful job on x men 2!)that's for sure but he did a decent job though; the actors were pretty close to their character and Chilkis and Evans were particularly good. Even Alba did good. That's true she is way too young to play Sue but if you want to blame someone, blame our youth male oriented obsessed society; not the actress. The screenplay was fairly true to the essence of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby'comic books. anyway, hats off to everyone involved here and hopefully F4 will be as enjoyable as part one.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four is not fantastic,"I saw Fantastic Four yesterday with low expectations and left dumber than I could have expected. I literally laughed at almost every serious scene and I wanted to punch The Thing in the face every time he moaned about how ""he wanted to be normal"" and ""the others don't know how good they had it"". The movie was extremely unconvincing and made me hate myself. The movie would have been much better if it was meant to be a parody on superhero movies, but the fact of the matter is that it wasn't. It was meant to be and Action- Packed Thriller and instead it was a giant joke. I wasn't disappointed due to the fact that I didn't really want to see it in the first place after seeing The Thing say ""It's clobbering time"" in the previews. I can honestly say that the only good thing about the movie was the scene where Jessica Alba gets in her underwear when she thought she was invisible, and she still was no where near as sexy as she was in the great Sin City. Overall, Fantastic Four's acting was under par, the plot was terrible,the writing was terrible, and the special effects were only mediocre.I do not recommend this movie for anyone but mindless idiots who like cheesy lines ""Flame On"" or geeks who are absolutely obsessed with Jessica Abla.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie! Give it a chance! Go see it ignoring the biased reviewers.,"First of all there are apparently people here who are determined to make this movie look bad without even seeing it and then there are those who are saying it is the best film of the year. Look at the star rating statistics (as of now 120 people said Fantastic Four only gets one star and then there are hundreds of people saying it got ten stars)! To me that shows no one has even seen this movie as it's star rating lies near the middle.I took the risk and saw it today and I had an open mind about it. I myself would give it 7 stars out of 10. I think many people think this movie is garbage simply because of the Thing's and Doctor Doom's costumes from the trailers. However the Thing and many of his comments made this movie very enjoyable. In fact I would rank the Thing character as being in second place with having a cool, entertaining attitude next to Hugh Jacksman's portrayal of Wolverine.This movie was not predictable and it had lots of humor. This movie is very fun just like the first Spider-man. In fact if this came out before Spider-man it would have been just as successful as the first Spider-man.This movie is perfect for families to take their kids to during this summer of dark movies. I think it will be the families who will make this movie a success. Closed minded teenagers however won't be seeing this, but as a comic fan, I am very happy with this movie and I hope they make more sequels! Like I said, it's just as fun as Spider-man so why aren't people cutting that up? Give it a chance!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truly the worst superhero movie of all time,"This movie is absolutely awful. I didn't click on the spoiler because there is no way to give away the plot. There is no plot in this movie what so ever. Of course Dr. Doom is the villain, but you'd never know that considering that his only evil deed is being a jerk. I mean at least in other comic book movies the the villain had an agenda, a reason for the hero to stop him. In this movie The Fantastic four our praised by all of humanity and even the government, which doesn't make sense because in real life the army would crazy to try and stop them, but no everyone looks at them like regular people. If thats what really happens in life, then why aren't the X-men accepted by the rest of humanity, because people are afraid of what they don't understand. But my final thought is that this movie is crap, and special effects don't make up for lame writing.Next time give the characters some depths.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slightly better than mediocre,"Fantastic Four was better than mediocre, but not by much. I am not familiar with the comic book series (this *is* based on a comic book, right?), but the movie trailer gave away pretty much the entire story so I already knew what was going to happen for almost the entire length of the movie. Take the bits and pieces of the trailer, throw in a bunch of filler sequences, add a decent ending, and you'll have the final version of this movie.I understand the need for the introductions, explaining how/why the people got their powers, and so on...but come on, couldn't they have made it any more interesting? The special effects were decent in places, but nothing to get all exclamatory about. The acting was...decent...but, again, not all that superb. The dialog seemed forced in many places. Most of the laugh lines were so cheesy I couldn't even force a smile, let alone a laugh. There was only one time when I truly laughed, and one other time I let out a half-hearted chuckle. If you're expecting comedy in this movie (which I wasn't) you will be sorely disappointed.All that being said, why did I even give out 6 stars? Well, all-in-all it was an okay movie, one that I believe kids and families would enjoy. There were some decent special effects, the ending (the only part of the story I didn't know from the trailer) was worth seeing, and of course the presence of the lovely Jessica Alba.I know this is supposed to be a review of Fantastic Four...but if anyone is still considering between seeing Fantastic Four or Batman Begins, please go see Batman Begins by all means. There is no comparison between the two.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Not marvelous, but worth the money","I must say that I got more than I expected out of this one. It was pretty enjoyable.The thing that caught me the most was the story. It was much deeper (but not very deep) than I thought it would be. It's not just Good Guys vs. Bad Guys, there's definitely more to it.The action scenes are good. Should keep you excited.It's probably more of a kids movie than an adult one, but I don't think that any adults watching would get bored sitting through it with their kids.Overall it's not marvelous, but money well spent.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four An Okay Comic Book Movie But Flawed,"Fantastic Four is another movie based on a comic book that's okay but it's not the greatest either. Director Tim Story does an all right job of bringing this film to the big screen but it's definitely no Batman Begins or Iron Man to name a few. Ian Grufford is good as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic but unfortunately he isn't given much to do and his powers aren't that great at least to me compared to Johnny's or even Dr. Dooms. Jessica Alba is admirable and does a solid job in her role as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman. Chris Evans stands out amongst them playing Sue's daredevil brother Johnny Storm/The Human Torch. The same can go for Michael Chiklis as Reed's best friend Ben Grimm/The Thing. I would have given this film a much lower rating if it wasn't for them but even they can't help this movie as a whole. Julian McMahon is equally impressive as Victor Von Doom/Dr. Doom but his fight with the Fantastic Four at the end doesn't last long and it ends up being a major letdown. Kerry Washington does what she can in a very brief cameo appearance as Alicia a possible love interest for Ben but her role seems entirely wasted. No offense. The rest of the cast turn in average performances but none of them stood out besides Evans and Chiklis. The special effects to create their various powers were cool but it wasn't anything we haven't seen before and the movie didn't bring anything really new to the genre. The few action sequences in the movie are well executed but they failed to leave an impression even the showdown at the end between Doom and the Fantastic Four. The dialogue isn't the greatest at times either. Overall though Fantastic Four is a decent movie worth seeing once or twice with some action, character development, some humor, and a little romance that make for a somewhat enjoyable movie to watch if you can get past it's flaws first.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun entertainment with no great meat. Enjoyable, funny, with Chiklis, Evans and McMahon great to watch.","All the production news, pre-release rumour and reviews were all pointing towards this being a bad movie. I was waiting for and expecting it, but as someone who has grown up reading comics, these years are the ones we are looking forward to. Our comic heroes are coming to the big screen and they are coming in droves, and not in eighties low budget style, but in big screen and with big budgets.Basically I couldn't miss this, I couldn't dare, despite what people said about it. Yet I still feared the worst.The early news that the latter portions of the movie were entirely re-written and re-cut during the editing process without the actors was worrying, and then seeing the reviews and the hefty defence of the movie by the Studio and actors was worrying.Something you have to think about with the characters in Fantastic Four is that they aren't like characters like Batman. Batman is hard edged, real, gritty, violent. Where the line between good and bad is bigger than the black and white put together, and that's where the Batman character lives.Fantastic Four is a lighter base of characters and stories, like Spiderman and such. There are clearer sides to be drawn on good and bad, and the characters stay there. The world is more fantasy than real, and with that I went to see the Fantastic Four.It starts off really fast, and keeps going like that. You really do notice that the story goes along faster than most other movies. Development of the characters before anything happens to them is out the window and before your seat is warm the team are in space and being hit by a storm.Now this isn't really a bad thing because firstly the pace of the movie seems pretty even, there's no point you're wishing it would either hurry up or slow down, it seems quite well paced throughout. Secondly, the character development isn't really forgotten, it's bundled in with the rest of the story, and this makes for a refreshing change. After all the story is about the Fantastic Four and Dr Doom, so let's see them.Character development is pretty loose on Mr Fantastic, Invisible Woman (I can't use the word girl when referring to Jessica Alba) and Von Doom. What you get is the bare minimum to set them up for the second film. The characters that we see a bit more of are Thing and Torch, and this is also good for they are at loggerheads from the beginning of the movie and are two entirely different characters.Thing is a family man, gentle and caring, and very thoughtful of others. Torch is a wild young guy who likes extreme sports and thinks only of himself. They're shown quite well, and the cheese factor seen in some of the trailers is not so apparent when you see the movie itself.For me the characters of Doom, Torch and Thing stand out the most. Doom is played by Julian McMahon very well, he's evil and self centred, making him an excellent choice for the new Hitcher role. His slow move to internal destruction and total acceptance of evil is well done, and his little nuances are good fun to watch.Chris Evans has some superb lines to deliver and delivers them with spot on timing. He's funny, and the comedy works. Michael Chiklis looks very at home in this role, although I kept thinking of Vic at certain points in the movie he did manage to shake the bad image quite well. He shows his trouble with accepting who he has become even through that huge suit, and you just can't help but like the character.The film really is a setup for the following movies, and there's nothing wrong with that, but you have to remember what this is. It's not gritty, meaty, thoughtful material. This is fun entertainment. Sit back and enjoy a comic ride, and it does work. I left having been entertained, and although I quickly moved on to think of other things, I still enjoyed it. Just because it is a comic adaptation, do not judge it with the same eye as Batman.Action is what makes the most of this movie. The set pieces are well conceived and orchestrated, particularly the early bridge piece that introduces the world to the characters.I'm not going to slate this movie, it's not fantastic, but it is good entertainment and opens the way for a strong series. The characters are good, with Torch, Doom and Thing stealing the show, and the action is strong as well. It's worth a watch if you don't fancy something to make you think too much, but do want to come away feeling you enjoyed yourself. Just remember two things, it's light, and it's entertainment. It's a popcorn movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Reed Richards makes no sense,"Reed Richards, the leader of the gang, makes no sense. He is a pacifist that urges everyone to apply reason. A researcher. ""Trust me. I'm not working on a hydro bomb. Now you relax, and be peaceful."" That character doesn't exist. It should be obvious. But then people don't seem to understand game theory: The rational response is always 'attack.' Whereas really it is the pacifist that is irrational. Game theory. Personally, I lost trust in the F4 franchise, when Reed Richards didn't add up to me. What kind of guy would he have to be then ? I would ditch the pacifist trait and keep him a researcher. The Pentagon would have to pay him, anyway.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best movie of the summer!,"The Fantastic Four was definitely a movie worthy of the summer slam jam. Yeah, it may have been missing such things as a ""meaningful plot"" but who cares? Was this story intended for such a thing? No! This movie was all about fun; Action-packed and full of super-heroes with awesome powers saving the day. What more could one want in a movie? This film gave the viewer the thrill of an amusement park ride from start to finish. At the end, all I could think was, ""it's over already?"" I think this movie could have easily been three hours long and still not have been long enough.Ioan Gruffudd of King Arthur fame performed Reed Richards(Mr. Fantastic) as I envisioned. The only problem I had with his portrayal was his age. Jessica Alba (Sin City, Dark Angel) played Sue Storm, also known as the ""Invisible Woman"", to the best of her ability. Not exactly who I would have seen play this role, but all in all, gave her best performance. I must say Michael Chicklas (The Shield, The Commish) was the best choice to play the lovable, tough guy, Ben Grimm better known as ""The Thing."" When it came to ""clobbering time"" his performance was notably off the hook! Finally, Chris Evans (Cellular) gave a great performance as Johnny Storm, also known as ""the human torch.""It seems the films of this summer have been critiqued before they have been given a chance to run. Do not be fooled! The Fantastic Four is an awesome film and offers a great time to be had by all. My hat off to Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Tim Story. Thank you for the fun and..

Entertaining but hokey,"Very loyal to the comic book feel, but it wasn't much of a 'human' story. It might have been more interesting if the characters had been more surprised about their new found powers/conditions. Aside from the Things character, everyone else was like ""Hey I'm a complete freak, but oh well, back to business.""It might have been more interesting if the story had focused more on each individuals personal demons and nightmares while dealing with their new strangeness.I know it's based on a comic book, but I think a story is more interesting if peoples actions are a little more believable according to their situation. It's like saying the 'normal' laws of emotions all of a sudden don't apply and it makes the whole story hard to swallow.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lazy,"Fantastic Four has forced plot points, corny dialogue, generic relationships, and a hollow story. Plus, the climax is underwhelming and characters don't arc. First, the script glosses over conflicts and pads the runtime with filler. Entire scenes are dedicated to failed jokes and thrills, stalling the narrative. Next, since real drama is avoided, dynamics are shallow. Johnny is impulsive, Sue and Reed conflict, and Ben feels grotesque, but that all miraculously resolves without true motivation. Lastly, Fantastic Four's lighthearted tone is excessively cliche because the writing isn't substantial, interesting, or unique. Consequently, the movie is emotionally void.Technically, Fantastic Four is mixed. The atmosphere is dull, the editing is diluted, and the music is dated. Also, the production design is unconvincing because lighting is overdone, extras are sparse, and sets lack detail. Conversely, there is decent camerawork (focus, dolly zooms, and movement), the cast has memorable members, and the sound is complex (despite being occasionally silly). The effects are mainly dated CGI, but the make-up and prosthetics deserve credit. Lastly, the acting is repetitive, but that's the material's fault. Ultimately, Fantastic Four's subpar technicals and lifeless script deliver a lazy film that falls completely flat.Writing: 3/10

Frivolous Four aren't quite Doomed,"Let's be clear: this is the 2nd live-action version on this original quartet since they first appeared in the 1961 comic book. It doesn't matter to me that the 1st version (early nineties) was never released. Marvel now has two (2) tries at this and they nearly flubbed it again (much like with The Punisher). It's not quite the deal breaker a lot of fans believe it to be, with just enough of the spirit and accuracy for the characters to pass the grade. Just. My main problem is not with the four heroes, but the villain.Chiklis as The Thing/Grimm is great. He grumbles & groans as I've always imagined he would if stepping out from the 4-color pages. They may want to evolve the suit in the sequel a bit. He provides half the humor. The other half is provided by Evans as The Torch. Not quite the Johnny Storm of the books, but there's just enuff there with his repartee with Grimm and his kid brother standing with Sue. Frankly, I found the comic book Johnny kind of boring when he wasn't arguing with Grimm. And yes, I don't like Evans' buzz-cut, but oh well. Alba as Susan & Gruffudd as Reed have been getting a bad rap; I think this is fallout from the other two having all the best lines and scenes (gee, sort of like in the comic books!). Alba's performance was not embarrassing and, yes, she was bossy in a scene or two - playing Johnny's older sister, as in the comic books. Gruffudd was overly awkward as a young scientist lacking social skills but he was always less colorful, character-wise, in the books. Some of the later writers (after Stan Lee) in the books (in the eighties) made him even more boring than he is here. And, it was telling, in the final battle scene, that Reed did take command (finally).And now we come to the villain, as essayed by McMahon. Dr.Doom is, was and will be the greatest super-villain ever created by the biggest comic book company in the world. Here is where the film falls into travesty, from which there is no redemption. By contrast with the books, we have Von Doom as interpreted by a TV actor who doesn't alter his performance one iota from the characters he played in Nip/Tuck & Charmed. All right, some may argue, what if an audience has never seen those TV series for comparison. Sorry, no can do. McMahon shows he has no range whatsoever; forget 'limited range' - NO range! His inflections & line readings are the same, regardless of what the scene calls for. It's all done with the same, slightly smarmy tone. There was nothing to be done with his actual voice, I suppose, but, perhaps, if Doom returns in a sequel, it's not necessary to have the same actor. Let's have Doom possess a commanding, domineering voice, as he was meant to. And, most of all, let's have his motivations be correct; none of this lusting for Sue, this petty griping about money. That's just not Doom - it's some Doombot or his loser cousin.The problems with Doom outweigh some of the liberties taken with the FF's history. I would've given almost anything to see the FF crash-land a space shuttle in a deserted area after exposure to the rays in space, as visualized in my mind for 35 years. I could've done without Grimm's wife, a clumsy attempt by writers to give The Thing more angst. I don't know why the screenplay was unable or unwilling to just start with Doom in Latveria (picture Doom seated on his throne as news of the FF breaks out: ""Hm, I'll have to delay my plan for global conquest until I dispose of these 4 clownish freak-isms.""). But, those are all the breaks and just quibbles. At least they managed to include Willie Lumpkin. As entertainment, this FF film outstrips The Hulk(03) handily and is not quite up there with X-Men(2000). Hopefully a sequel will move things up a notch, influenced more by some Jack Kirby spectacle.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
'Fantastic Four' the whole family;,"The trend of Marvel heroes being transferred from the comic books to the big screen continues with Tim Story's adaptation of the 'Fantastic Four'. By having an ensemble of popular TV actors rather then any big names, Story allows the audience to concentrate on the movie and the incredible special effects.The sexy Jessica Alba from Dark Angel and Sin City fame takes on the role of the Invisible girl and although the male audience will be disappointed to learn they'll hardly see Ms. Alba, rest assured when you do see her, the wait is worth it.To see Michael Chiklis from 'The Shield' as straight up 'good guy' is both strange and refreshing. Casting Chiklis as the 'The Thing' could have been considered as a risk but both the producers and Chiklis must be smiling to learn their gamble paid off and then some.Julian McMahon who plays the slick Dr. Troy in Nip/Tuck excels as the villainous electric Von Doom while on the other side of the intensity spectrum, Chris Evans dons the 'flame' of 'The Torch' and has the audience chucking with his witty, Ryan Reynolds-esquire performance.The enjoyable and atypical plot enables the audience to gradually learn about the characters, their powers and the emotions they endure as they come to terms with their fate. Even though the final confrontation between good and evil leaves a lot to be desired, one can't help feeling that this is a solid foundation to build a successful franchise on.With humour, incredible stunts and effects, 'Fantastic Four' has something enjoyable for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four is a flop and there are reasons why,"It's bad. I'm sorry but it is bad. There's no actual plot here, they've decided to introduce the characters and they never gave them a real antagonist to fight against. There were no stakes here, there was no real plot. The characters could have been interesting in another story but in this movie they simply didn't work. There was no chemistry between the characters, there was simply not the typical superhero charm. Chris Evans is the only one that actually sticks out and his character is the only one who has some tasteful and fun dialogue. This had the potential to be fun but the plot never became more than an origin story. It is a no-brainer why the ""Fantastic Four"" were a flop and honestly I'm just curious is the new remake going to have potential or are these characters simply weak against the other superhero franchises?",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't let them make a fool of you,"In the terms of the Fast Sweep /term being my old invention in the movie-making business/ the film is a real waste of time, idiotic in a special way. Some hail its CGI. You have never seen the productions of Lucas, Spielberg, and Jackson. Jessica Alba is a nice girl who suddenly was put in a hostile environment. None can build her career on a c*** like this. The idiotic plot, an ocean of inconsequence should knock all dinos down and away off the face of the earth. It's a miracle of her guts and apparel she's survived. The movie tries to be a heritage of Spiderman and a line of classics, I won't tire you with mentioning them , cause you know them all. I am not gonna go deeper into this because so frank the things need no nailing or hammering. They die naturally. If I ever showed up here and wrote the very lines, it's cause I'd made a mistake and took a little boy named Robert to watch the flick. His mom wasn't quite snoring in the movies and he is eager as always right now, but we all feel it was a lost timeso many things could have been done. So don't make the same mistake, and stay tuned on to the IMDb.

The most comic book-like of comic book adaptations.,"I read a couple of reviews of this film which compared it unfavorably to other superhero comic book adaptations, such as that of Spiderman or Superman. But to me, this movie was the most like the experience of reading an actual comic book. That was what I enjoyed about it. I actually went to see it only because Ioan Gruffudd is in it (and annoyingly, he has been the least interviewed of all the cast members). I took my 10 and 12 year old sons. We liked it a lot better than the professional reviewers did. Plausibility is not a requirement when you're talking about superhero powers. We buy the abilities of Superman because we've grown up with them, but really--kryptonite? Why would kryptonite weaken someone who was born on a planet made of kryptonite? I want some plausibility in my comics, but I don't require absolute fidelity to the laws of science. I'm looking forward to sequels, because they can have more plot and less exposition, but as someone who hasn't read this particular set of comic books, the amount of exposition was fine.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four was okay,The story is quite fine with some fantastic parts in it. Dr. Doom was one of the best performances in this movie. It was entertaining in most parts and really charming. But the movie is way too predictable and forces a lot of things.,5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as Bad as Feared,"Honestly, when I set out to see the Fantastic Four, I was pretty much convinced I was going to see something very painful. After the fiasco of Daredevil, and judging by some rather... interesting choices in the trailers, I pretty much figured that this was going to be another Comic Masacre. I'm glad I was pleasantly surprised.The film managed to avoid being indecipherable to people new to the Fantastic Four without explaining every little detail to the point of being boring. It was a little goofy, the scene where our five main characters get their powers standing out as a good example of some moments which were unintentionally funny, but it managed to feel a lot like watching the actual comic book. As the Fantastic Four has always tended to be that way, I can't see it as a downside. The movie actually made me laugh at several points, Johnny in particular was hilarious, and I thought Von Doom was really well done.The plot line is very slow-paced, and there isn't a whole lot of super-heroing all things considered, but as it had to explain five separate stories whilst trying not to give anyone the short-end of the stick, this is understandable. Some things that bothered me would only bother someone who was a little familiar with the Fantastic Four beforehand. I can't fathom Jessica Alba as Sue Storm. Her performance wasn't bad, but it just didn't feel as though she were playing Sue Storm. It felt as though I was watching Jessica Alba, and I didn't get that with any of the other characters. The special effects were fun, and some of the scenes managed to be shocking without an over-use of gore or violence. Another good thing about this film is its lack of preaching. There were no long-winded speeches on teamwork or heroics, and while there were definite and strong moral themes, especially about acceptance, they aren't shoved down your throat.On the whole, I'd say it's a good film to see, especially in a group.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful Movie,"I have never really been interested in comic books and such, so when I saw the movie I was pleasantly surprised by the plot line. Its always nice to see how different people can work together in a difficult situation. I came first and foremost to see Ioan Gruffudd, star of the Horatio Hornblower series, who plays the brilliant leader Dr. Reed Richards. However, after watching the movie, I came to appreciate all of the actors for their superb acting skills. The biggest challenge was the ""Human Torch"" who annoyed me to no end at the beginning, but by the end, I could see that each of the Fantastic Four, including him, had something wonderful to offer. I would definitely see this movie again. If nothing else, it showed that even the ""nerd"" can have a happy ending without it being too sappy.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun movie;  about what you would expect,"The plot: Five people are in a space station and they get hit by some sort of solar storm, which gives them super powers. Four of them become the Fantastic 4, and they do some super hero type stuff while dealing with their anxieties over their drastically changed lives. The fifth becomes the bad guy, and (surprise!) there's a big battle at the end.The good: Jessica Alba. Holy Mary mother of God, that woman is gorgeous. What a body, what a face, what an outfit! Good acting as well. Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm is also great, that guy could stand in a corner and chew gum and his screen presence would still steal the show. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm is rather entertaining, he takes great pleasure in picking on Chicklis' character, which got a genuine chuckle out of me on more than one occasion. Overall this movie was surprisingly funny. It certainly made me snicker many more times than most of the pathetic comedies Hollywood is putting out these days.Special effects were great overall, the only really obvious CGI scene being where Reed Richards character (the rubber man) gets heated up and begins stretching out of control, falling through a window; it looked really fake. Everything else was quite acceptable. The climatic battle was even impressive.The bad: Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards. He's easy to miss as he's completely overshadowed by anything or anyone appearing on screen at the same time as him. His character doesn't even reach the level of one-dimensionality. An obvious stinker in the middle of his three entertaining co-stars. Julian McMahon as the bad guy, Victor Von Doom, is nearly as banal. I had a hard time telling the two of them apart. But at least McMahon is evil, which in and of itself gives him some personality. Oddly, in the ""behind the scenes"" feature on the DVD, the actor has much more personality in real life than he does as his comic book super villain character.I also give the movie a point deduction for the obnoxious ""hip"" music that keeps blaring through the soundtrack. I know it's made for young ""hip"" kids, but really...no need to annoy the crap out of the rest of us. Oh well, at least it wasn't rap.Overall, nothing great, just about what you'd expect but for the surprisingly funny jokes and of course, the amazingly beautiful Jessica Alba. I liked it. You could do far, far worse with these super hero movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sorry excuse for an action film and not much better as a comic book adaptation either.,"Fantastic Four is a film that astounds and surprises but maybe not necessarily for the right reasons; it's a film that will have you laughing at it rather than with it for most of the time with its ludicrous situations and ideas that it so desperately wants you to believe; and yet it remains a solid if not unspectacular entry into the recent spate of comic book adaptations even if it does play out like a B-movie 90% of the time.It seems ironic that the director is called Tim Story because he clearly doesn't have one to work with here since at its core, Fantastic Four is a film without one. In one half of this bi-linear film, you have Reed Richards (Gruffudd); Sue Storm (Alba); Johnny Storm (Evans) and Ben Grimm (Chiklis) all moping around trying to come to terms with their new powers and for Grimm, his new image. The other half consists of Victor von Doom (McMahon) getting a thirst for blood as he wipes out the board members that sacked him from his own company. It seems strange that Spider-Man from three years previous managed to show us Peter Parker's reaction to his new found powers in a fun and somewhat entertaining montage in about five minutes; here it takes up almost half the film. But there is plenty more wrong with Fantastic Four. If you can get over the fact that the 'bad guy' is called 'von Doom' and manage to refrain yourself from chuckling whenever his hilariously camp villain is on screen, you'll surely not be able to look past the way all the characters seem to whisper their lines for the first forty minutes; the way the film would then blast us with juvenile rock music whenever it felt like and the way Johnny Storm has the mental capacity of a sixteen year old yet is apparently smart enough to be an astronaut, despite not knowing what the temperature of the sun is.Yes, Fantastic Four is a film that is on par with The Core in terms of not only scientific screw ups but terrible characterisation. I find it amazing that shortly after the space storm, or whatever it was, gives them the powers; they spend some time in quarantine and yet nobody there is able to register they have abnormal DNA inside them; nobody ever grabs one of the four and shakes them by the shoulders exclaiming: 'Shut up and listen; you're different' but the one thing that really takes the cake is the fact von Doom apparently doesn't even need to be in quarantine since we see him out and about whilst everyone else is at hospital. As a villain, von Doom is very weak with his victims being very obvious in obligatory scenes you just groan at: the doctor that wants to tell everyone; the board member in the car park and our heroes as a whole: his antagonism and sense of threat is either anti-climatic, needless or pointless.As characters, our heroes that are the Fantastic Four are equally anti-climatic or needless. None of them are developed beyond any form of what they are at the very beginning bar Ben Grimm (aka The Thing). Grimm's fiancé it would seem, ditches Ben telling us she truly does go for what's on the outside and not inside. Grimm is also the strongest of the four and has the worst reaction to the accident: both physically and psychologically as he contemplates suicide on a bridge. He even finds time to tempt himself into falling in love again. It is here that I suggest the film should have been made with Grimm as the lone character. The film does not need Johnny Storm what-so-ever; it does not need Sue Storm either except for maybe getting some male teenage audiences in and the only reason for Richards' inclusion is so that someone has the level of intelligence to try and build a machine that'll reverse the effects but that is a sub-plot that is weak, underdeveloped and actually rather pointless. Take out Richards, give Grimm his intelligence and then you might have a good film.But then we wouldn't be able to gush at Johnny's fire effect or the way he treats women like trash; we wouldn't be able to see him do his insane bike stunts to loud rock music. Johnny actually soaks up the media attention the film has within it but previous comic book efforts have society dislike their heroes at the beginning: Batman and Spider-Man are good examples with X-Men 2 using it as an entire narrative drive. Fantastic Four is a film that would have all its women in its universe blindingly attractive; I highly doubt girls as pretty as Jessica Alba would go on dates to an observatory with their boyfriends and that the nurse at the beginning would be as dumb and as attractive as she was, simultaneously. Fantastic Four is also a film that thrives on its product placement: one such tilt shot starts on 'ESPN' and then moves down to the action. Burger King's 'flamed to perfection' also cashes in  I guess a $100,000,000 budget wasn't enough for Mr. Story and co..So with cartoon characters that are as badly written as cartoon characters in a three picture skit; a story that revolves around pretty much nothing for three quarters of the time and a film that is relatively action starved, the film is a failure. The only reprieve Fantastic Four might have is that its villain is defeated in its finale through good use of science rather than aggression but that is clutching at some extremely thin straws.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Mostly just setting up,"Scientists Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) convinces former colleague Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon) to conduct an experiment on his company's space station as a cosmic storm approaches. Along for the ride is the company genetics scientist Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) and her brash pilot brother Johnny (Chris Evans). They get hit with the storm that changed their genetic makeup. They gain superpowers but not all of them are happy with all the changes.The movie starts too slowly. For an action superhero movie, this really needed to start out right at the space station. There's no time to waste on too much unnecessary setup. The action needs to start as soon as possible. The fact is the whole movie is one big introduction. The group dynamic hasn't been set yet. The constant fighting between Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm still isn't something between old buddies.

It's Clobberin' Time,"This is a forgettable superhero movie (indeed, I'd forgotten most of it since I last saw it over a decade ago), but it's somewhat interesting to compare now to subsequent movies in the genre, especially the later, and also lousy, reboot in 2015. I watched the two back to back, and while both bad, they are so in very different ways. Around the early 2000s, which many credit as the dawn of the modern superhero genre despite there already having been decades of Superman and Batman films, there were the beginnings of the Blade, Hellboy, Spider-Man and X-Men series. The superhero movie tended to be largely light in tone, both in lighting and by the plethora of silly zingers, and with a few more-serious set pieces where the superheroes rescued people. it was still the early days of the dominance of CGI, and the effects sometimes looked as cartoonish as the rest of the comic-book treatment.In the wake of the Dark Knight trilogy, however, the 2015 ""Fantastic Four"" is all gloom and zero zingers. I'd imagine even Zack Snyder telling the remake to lighten up. Yet, in 2005, ""Fantastic Four"" was more concerned with slick matching uniforms like the X-Men had, or with becoming heroes by saving people on a bridge like Spiderman, or demonstrating some patriotism with shots next to the Statue of Liberty because 9/11 was a recent tragedy. Regardless, both movies feel as though they're clobbering us with a formula borrowed from others rather than reimagining anything new or, at least, interesting to distinguish the particular superhero entry. Now, that we're in the 2020s, even the DCEU has largely relinquished its darker approach in favor of imitating the MCU formula, so it's appropriate that the next time we see the Fantastic Four on the screen it'll likely be as part of the MCU.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not great but pretty entertaining...,"I have never read a Fantastic Four comic (what can I say I'm a DC man.) so take from that what you will. I've heard lots of rabid haters of this movie. Both from people who have seen it and from those who have not. Some folks (specifically Harry Knowles from AICN) could not wait to bash this movie. Now, I admit there is some cheesy dialogue here and there, and some special effects that ain't so special but after the movie was over I was happy. And that's what I go to the movies for... to be entertained. And judging by the crowd they were happy too.The action starts early but It's the Four discovering their powers, bickering, mastering their powers, bickering, and learning to work as a team, and bickering that made me enjoy the movie. Thing I didn't like? Dr. Doom honestly... I never EVER felt him as a threat.Anyway, go watch the movie and have a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worst movie ever!,"I saw this movie yesterday at a free screening and I have to say that I'm extremely disappointed. This is one of, if not the worst movie of all time. From the moment it began until the second it finished I found myself in pain because of how bad it was. The dialog was much cornier than anything I've ever seen, its worse than in the love scenes between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman in star wars. Things that weren't supposed to be funny were. The only way I can envision someone actually paying to see this movie is to see Jessica Alba. Without her it would have been much worse (if thats possible). The only other positive that i can draw from this movie is the human torch. He had his moments. I would rather see Gigli, Daredevil, Electra, Artificial Intelligence and You Got Served all in the same day than to see this atrocious movie one more time. Bottom line is you couldn't pay me to sit through the fantastic four again.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

F'n Terrible!,"I caught the flick at an industry screening and it is, without a doubt, the lamest superhero movie you'll ever see (this includes Roger Corman's unreleased 1993 version). If they ever decided to make a live-action Fantastic Four TV series, this would be the pilot episode, and a pretty mediocre one at that. Seriously, I'm not fanboy or anything, but even I know that Johnny Storm's hair is supposed to be long and blonde. Why change it? And check out Alba's gratuitous cleavage on the internet ads. Nice going there, Fox guys.Anyways, Fox needed a cheap director they could control who can yell ""action"" while a group of execs behind him decide how the movie will play, which is exactly what happened on this film. For more Tim Story goodness, check out (or don't) the generic ""Taxi"" with Jimmy Fallon.This is an embarrassment to all those involved. Too bad, too, because the FF is a great comic book property and the movie has a solid cast (hence the 2 stars, one for Chris Evans, the other for Mike Chiklis).2 STARS OUT OF 10",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Excellent . . .wait . . .I mean Fantastic! That's a pun!,"I'm going to be short and to the point. This movie was excellent, I'm going to say excellent, since everyone is going to say fantastic. Anyway, the story differs a little from the original storyline but the characterization of the characters was just perfect. The plot is straight forward with few surprises and it was always nice to a see a nod or two to the hardcore fans with cameos by stan lee and mentions of Latveria. Dr. Doom was just awesome, I've never been able to imagine what his voice would sound like but the way his voice was so menacing beneath the mask in this movie was chilling. Doom is probably the best portrayed Marvel villain as of yet. Reed and Sue were both well portrayed and there was a great number of invisible woman jokes to get a good chuckle out of. The hands down BEST part of this movie was Chris Evans and Michael Chicklis. They banter and go back and forth so much as Human Torch and Thing that it was just like reading a comic of Fantastic Four. That was the real gem of the movie. And who doesn't like a bad ass hot head like Johnny Storm? This movie is definitely an 8 of out 10. I know I know I said I wouldn't be cheesy but come on, it's the freaking fantastic four. So I say.

I was totally surprised,"I really went in thinking this movie was going to bite and I would be embarrassed to admit that I'd seen it. I was wrong. It was good. Really good. The dude that played Johnny Storm was fantastic. The Thing's make-up was a bit of a disappointment, but after a while, it didn't seem to matter. The special effects were great, well-done. Not half-ass-ed CGI at all. I'd totally recommend it to anyone looking for a great, fun summer flick. There's nothing parents would find objectionable for kids. There's nothing Christians, Muslims, Hindis or Jews might find offensive either.

The essential Fantastic Four captured on film,"I've been waiting a long time to see this movie. The Fantastic Four are one of my favourite comic book hero's. So you can imagine, with such expectation the likelihood of disappointment is high. I took my daughter to opening day and left the cinema with confused thoughts.The strength of the movie was it's development of the characters. They were real, even Von Doom (considering the things that went wrong in his life I'd be mighty angry too). I loved the by-play between Johnny and Ben, hilarious. Some of Johnny's lines were predictable but were delivered with such roguish charm that it was hard not to enjoy his character.The down side of the movie was it's lack of drama or incident. We had the space station, the bridge, Doom's attempted elimination of potential threats to his plan and the final battle with Doom. But for a feature length movie of its type, this was not enough. At least not for my 12 year old daughter. Overall, she enjoyed the movie and had a few laughs along the way but next time can 'we' add some extra drama and tension (I know for the first installment this was meant to be light hearted but .....).Anyway, being an obsessive personality I had some free time the following night so I took myself off to see the movie again and you know what, I enjoyed it even more. I had a greater appreciation for the work and left the cinema satisfied in the knowledge that the team who put this work together did a great job in introducing us to the Fantastic Four. It displayed some of the original freshness we were treated to way back in the early 60's. Can't wait for number 2. Wouldn't mind seeing Galactus and the Surfer!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Would Have Been Good, If It wasn't So Awful!","I really tried to like this movie, and for about the first 40 minutes, I did I pretty good job of tricking myself into having a relatively good time. But after that it became too much work and I had to start hating it. Everything they shot for, was a total miss. Plot-slow and sparse. Action-Cheesy. Emotionally Provoking Sap-Kinda Funny. Everything that you'd want out of the Fantastic Four was well represented in the trailer and I recommend that you keep it at that. The super powers of the characters were far too cartoony to be pulled off in alive action movie. If they had gone and made this a CGI movie, I think it would have avoided being a total mess.If you were on the edge about seeing this movie, do us a favor, and Don't. It will discourage the studio from looking at the box office grossings and deciding to force feed an even worse sequel.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than Batman Begins.,"Fantastic Four is a better movie than Batman Begins is a film. Even though the movie has two principal characters miscast, Reed Richards and Sue Storm, there was, surprisingly, enough chemistry and pace to make for an enjoyable movie. I was pleased that there was no megalomaniacal world domination plot or threats from a shadowy society cursed by the incoherence of Yoda and coming across about as menacing as Ninja Turtles. The effects are blended well into the storytelling and the Thing's costume works very well. Although few would look as good as Jessica Alba does in her FF suit, she is too young and lacks all of the intangibles required for an actor's presence and ""weight"" in a role. As they should, the Thing and Johnny Storm are the highlight of the endeavor.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Just go in expecting a fun popcorn no brine and you will enjoy the F4.And if you're a Jessica fan like me...then keep an eye on all the great shots of her..and there are lots.. Oh i forgot there's a baddie in this movie. His name is Dr Doom. But who cares. He didn't interest me nor did i really care about him.

Fantastic Four,"I think it was pretty good. When i first heard it was coming out in movie form, i thought it was gonna be really boring, one of those typical sci-fi action movies. Well it WAS a sci-fi action movie but it was really engaging and interesting. For me, a movie is considered good as long as it captures my attention and makes me lean forward and focus on the movie, every minute. That's exactly what i did with the Fantastic Four. The cast was pretty good and the plot too. There was a lot of action so it captures the viewer. All this was toppled up with humour injected at several points. I wouldn't say it was the best of all movies, but it was alright, it was better than i expected, i would say. If u are a fan of the Fantastic Four comics, you may have different opinions..i dunno. But I've never read the comics, and I didn't have any prior background info about the characters. So it was okay for me. If you're someone who doesn't like elaborate artificiality like for example, a man who can stretch like a rubber band, or man who can just light up and fly around on fire, than maybe u'll not really be a fan of this movie..but hey, go with an open mind and you just might enjoy it!

A second tier film for a second tier superhero group,"FANTASTIC FOUR is yet another attempt for Hollywood to capitalize on the resurgence of the superhero genre which began with the first SPIDERMAN. This resurgence has been uneven at best with some truly great films and some that are not even worth mentioning. The true greats distance themselves from the not so greats through their desire to treat the superheros as people with emotions and real life concerns that exist outside of their special abilities. Being a superhero is not all that ""super."" It is all responsibility with little or no reward. The great ones exploit this, and the bad ones ignore it. It is here where FANTASTIC FOUR mostly fails. The film seems more concerned with explosions and bad action sequences than real emotion. The human side is explored superficially with Ben Grimm's ""The Thing"" as he tries to gain an understanding of his new and frightening outward appearance, but it does not reach deep enough into his soul to make it memorable. Their are some entertaining moments so the film is not a total wash, but it definitely lacks the depth, complexity, and superior character study of really great superhero films like BATMAN BEGINS and SPIDERMAN 2.Marc Richardson",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Watch this movie, you won't be disappointed.","I do think that this movie is better than Spiderman. Fantastic! I have reed the comic books an the casting are perfect. Jessica Alba as The Invisible Woman; Ioan Gruffudd as Mr. Fantastic; Michael Chiklis as The Thing and Chris Evans as The Human Torch. Could it be better? No. I don't think so. Awesome movie.My high hopes for the movie, were dashed before the film even opened in theaters, by critics who were panning the movie from advanced screenings. - Why in the hell do I listen to movie critics? The movie has it all - a tight, well written story, believable characters, that I really wanted to see. This movie was the best movie that I've seen this year.

"no character development, poor direction, not a good movie","I have never been a fan of comic books, but have enjoyed the movies based on comic book characters. The wife and I really enjoyed X-men, X-men II, Spiderman, and 3 of 5 of the Batman movies. Now, I had no expectations going into this movie. I did not know the story, and could not be disappointed by a lack of being true to the comic. If it was true or not, I don't know.On casting: Jessica Alba is what, 24? She is supposed to be the same age as the other MIT grads who look as if they are in their late 30's if not into their 40's? I just didn't buy it. I am not a huge fan of hers anyway. Not that she did a bad job, it is just that she was not the right choice for this role.Character development: It didn't exist. Sure there were some attempts to tell the audience about the characters, but not enough time was spent getting you to know them or even care about them. I think each person got one sentence about their past. For instance Johnny getting kicked out of NASA for trying to smuggle models aboard a flight simulator. That is about all there was introducing his character. Von Doom got three scenes devoted to his character, and it still wasn't enough.Directing: I have no experience making movies, just a fan for a long time. Anyway, I'd say that there were too many plot holes to make this a good movie, but it is hard to find the plot. Maybe I fell asleep, but how do people walk around a space station like they are walking on earth? Did I miss the part about artificial gravity? They may have mentioned it, but I don't remember. They could have, and should have added at least another 20 minutes to this film in order to answer some obvious questions that the directing brings up, and to develop the characters.Overall: I think this film was made to show of Alba's body in a tight outfit and to demonstrate special effects. I know I am in the minority, but she doesn't do anything for me. There are other types of movies out there (adult) that I'd watch if I wanted to see a woman showing off her body.I left this movie wishing I had the 45 minutes and my money back. I know the movie is longer than 45 minutes, it is just short. I would wait for this to come to the rental store, or to cable/sat before I watched it. I really can't believe the box office numbers for this movie. But, I was one of the people out there on the opening weekend, so I contributed.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Superficial, But...","FANTASTIC FOUR *** It's not so fantastic. Tim Story's adaptation from the comic book series, where it is all based on, falls short on script and tries to make up for it in special effects and loud scenarios.

Scientists who are exploring space are mutated into superhumans - that is, the ""Fantastic Four"" - and try to make things right again.

the Fantastic Four as they should be,"oh come on people, what were you expecting? i had low expectations myself when i went to see this movie, but i came out satisfied.for those of you still in awe with Batman Begins, yes it's a far stellar movie. but FF is NOT trying to become one of those! it's not meant to be a serious, deep character building movie. in the comics they fought aliens and travel to other dimensions, and you expect the movie to be on the same tone as Batman?? well for starters, the characters and powers themselves are already somewhat silly, campy, 60's material at best. who can took Lee and Kirby's version of their origin without laughing hard in this modern age? just the achievement of making Mr. Fantastic, who's supposed to be a genius, stretch himself without looking silly is already a great accomplishment! you gotta understand they filmmakers were trying very hard to walk a fine line between campy powers and realism, and i think they succeed well! the reason why ""The Incredibles"" works so well is because their entire environment are not real. now the FF's got pretty much the same powers, but they gotta look and feel as in the real world. that took some hard work and i'm pleased of what they did.my one minor quibble is about Dr. Doom, whom i feel isn't quite badass enough. perhaps he should be given a larger, grander cause of evil.i hope they'd do well in the box office, cos i'll sure be in line for the sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"The not so Fantastic 4, but still not as bad as the 1994 version","I've got to learn to not get so excited when I see trailers for movies because it seems that one of two things happens: either they show too much of the movie and spoil too much, or, what they show is all of the good stuff. In this case, it's both. For some reason, I was blinded by the bright lights of the teaser, which lead to the trailer(s). With an up and coming cast, Gruffudd, Chiklis, Evans, Alba, and McMahon, I was stoked that the special effects would be the highlight of the film, as there were no high salaried actors in the bunch. With the exception of best known Alba, the rest haven't really established movie resumes.Gruffudd just played Lancelot in 'King Arthur', Chiklis has done TV and received 2 Emmys for Best Actor in a Drama for 'The Shield' on F/X (a Fox network), Evans did an awesome job in 'Cellular' last summer, and McMahon is another awesome actor from the F/X network, as a plastic surgeon on 'Nip/Tuck'. It was funny to keep hearing him refer to plastic surgery after ""the accident"" in the movie. Chiklis, who likes comic books anyway, was a good cast for the gruff role of Ben Grimm.All in all, I think the cast selection was excellent, as all fit their roles well, and were cookie cutter personalities from the comic books. Johnny was the cool guy everyone wants to be, Ben was the gruff sidekick that looked out for Reed and was constantly antagonized by Johnny, Reed was more concerned with his work than his relationship with Sue, and Sue was just there to look good. Victor/Dr. Doom was a good bad guy. I didn't like the ending with him, though.Where the film went wrong, in my opinion, was the writing. The story was just weak. Yeah, it had to have a background, which was fine, but it never really climaxed. It had a few cool sequences, but again, it's all stuff we've seen in the trailers and commercials. Here's where Michael France and Mark Frost are to blame.To make it simple, I'll spell it out for you: The Punisher and Hulk. And don't forget, Twin Peaks (what a weird series). In addition, if Tim Story is trying to make a directing name out of himself, stepping up to a movie with this high of a caliber potential won't work with writers like this. By the way, Tim Story was the 4th director assigned to this movie. The F/X were O.K., but no ILM. I would have hoped that Fox would have spent more there, than on salaries; I hope they didn't spend most of the budget on salaries. It had to have been the sets, in Canada. C'mon, what was Fox thinking? Story is BEST known for Barbershop, and Taxi? Sad, sad, sad.I was unfortunately distracted because I was so NOT enjoying this movie, and was looking for continuity errors and ways to make fun of the film. I got a chuckle every time someone said, ""Victor"", referring to Dr. Doom's alter ego. I kept thinking to myself, ""What's your Vector, Victor?""Uh anyway, the costumes were cool. I liked The Thing's body makeup. (Why was his fiancé out in the street in a negligee?) Before the movie, you can enjoy the trailer for Transporter 2!All in all, I'd strongly recommend NOT going to an evening show, and instead, hit a matinée and save SOME of your money. Better yet, wait until about September, and the $1.50 theater should have it.Spoiler alert!!! (In my opinion, not really, because IMDb already has this noted in the credits, anyway.) Oh yeah, look for Stan Lee, as the mailman. He actually has a speaking role and a real character name in the credits, this time.Flame off.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Like reading a comic book,"We've seen most of the ""comic book movies"" and felt this one rated at the bottom of the heap. My spouse thought it was worse than ""The Hulk."" Personally, I felt the special effects in ""Fantastic 4"" helped it edge just a bit ahead of ""The Hulk."" Either way, I'd take a pass on this movie and catch it on DVD when you've nothing better to do with your time. The acting is cheesy, and based on the performances it's hard to believe any of the actors have serious acting careers. The story line was spotty and the dialog was something I might have written if I was doing the screenplay. NOT a good thing!

One of the best movies i have ever seen!,I mean Jessica alba (The Invisable Woman) is really fine like when she has to take her cloths to turn invisible.

Dr. Doom just his power and his unbreakable metal skin and electricity. What else can you ask for to have just one of these powers. What i liked a lot is all the effects of the results of each power is movie rules. I mean i love all comic book movies but this one more then some of them and can't wait till I can buy it.

"Exceeded my low expectations, walked out pleasantly surprised","Hmm, should I see this film or not?After reading some IMDb reviews, and low user rating of 6.1, I figured FanFour was just another summer '05 dud... probably not a limp strip of emulsion the likes of Daredevil, just the latest weak link in the recent flaccid chain of Hollywood efforts. One more film dumbed down and numbed up just enough to get parents to fork over $20 to their kids, waiting on its real payday in the video market. One reviewer put it squarely between Daredevil and Spiderman. So, I decided NOT to see FanFour.Then I had a really bad day at work and decided a little escapism, even if it was mediocre, was in order. My choice was between the less than bewitching Bewitched, and not-so-Fantastic Four. FanFour began at a more convenient time, clinching the deal.As it turns out, I guess I am a bit more forgiving than the the average IMDb user. I enjoyed it. Yes, FanFour is between Daredevil and Spiderman, but notably closer to Spiderman. Spidey, XMen & X2, these are classics, as is the recent Batman Begins. These movies give the genre credibility, and share some common threads: all have adult appeal; all make the best of special effects; all did not lose sight of the fact that those effects needed to be built around a movie, not the other way around. (for you producers / directors out there who seem lost sight of this, movies are cinematic stories built first around a plot, carried off by a script. Remember this and you might live to film another day )FanFour had likable characters, reasonably well developed, though not the depth of Toby Maguire as Spiderman, or Christian Bale in Batman Begins. Then again, you've got four superheros, so just imagine the competition for face time on the widescreen. When it comes to character development, the FanFour do approach those other DNA mutants, the X Men. FanFour superpowers are in the same genetic phylum, but it's hard to beat the superstar cast of X Men, with super cool, yet deeply flawed personalities like Jackman's Wolverine. Nonetheless, FanFour hold their own.The plot is standard predictable fare, a tried and true formula that will only fail if you fill it full of holes, or carry it out with a bad script, or bad acting. But FanFour had a decent script, trying a bit too hard for that Schwarzeneggarian one-liner, but only at a couple moments by Michael Chiklis' character ""Ben Grimm, AKA the Thing."" And this is a minor footnote, fully forgivable because Chiklis is a fine actor and makes the Thing a completely endearing character, especially at one moment when he gives a look with his eyes, much like Puss & Boots in Shrek 2, and you just want to give the big boulder a hug. Borrowing ""Clobberin' time"", from previous incarnations of the Fantastic Four, brought cheers from my theater audience, and some one-liners were worthy, working well as a counterbalance within the playfully antagonistic relationship between The Thing and Chris Evans', The Human Torch, AKA Johnny Storm. This sort of plot/character development , much like that between XMen's Wolverine and Cyclops, adds depth and brought an enjoyable dimension to FanFour.As Johnny Storm, Evans is playfully devilish. A thrill-seeking adrenaline junkie, terribly likable and charismatic, and the human link between the characters in the movie and the world at large, including the audience inside the theater. No doubt all the young girls have noted his superhero sex appeal, unless they find themselves attracted to The Thing due to an Elektra complex and a daddy who looks like a large pinkish turd.Jessica Alba as the Invisible Woman does a fine job, and there is a great strip scene that you will see, but you won't see, if you see what I mean. And it's no stretch to enjoy Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards, rubber man / scientific genius leader of the Fan Four. He's given the job of a dry scientist, strong of mind, weak on emotion, and he does it well. But his warm looks and gentle persona draw you to him, and this works well to build tension throughout the movie as you wonder if a spark will be ignited between his character and Jessica Storm.One last note about Julian McMahon as the villainous Doom. This guy gives me the creeps as the shallow, morally challenged doctor on Nip/Tuck, and that quality translates well to the big screen. A good bad guy is a good thing.This was a good movie, though it could have benefited from a little refining of the script, and about 15 more minutes of movie, the extra time devoted to character & plot development. While I was hesitant to walk into the theater before the movie, I walked out pleasantly surprised. If they do a sequel I am interested enough to see how they will develop the characters, including a love interest for the Thing, and for me that says it all.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Utterly appalling hogwash!,"My goodness, the writers certainly didn't bother to carry out their homework for this lamentable ""Marvel Comic"" superhero film. None of the cast can act, it is all about good looks and terrible CGI effects. The plot is non-existent and the film lurches from one poor scene to the next. The direction and dialogue are equally dreadful. The man who was Victor Von Doom has absolutely nothing to do. He just waits around for his own evil alter ego to develop. In addition, this awful film would have you believe that Von Doom's body changed at the same time as that of The Fantastic Four whilst in outer space! That was never the case nor anything remotely like it. What actually occurred as depicted in the comics, was that Von Doom was born and raised in Latvia during a time of political turmoil. He came from a family of gypsies and his father was a member of a group of Resistance fighters who tried to overthrow the ruthless tyrant who ruled the entire country. Later on, Von Doom came to America to enrol at a university in New York. He was already an exceptionally gifted scientist and someone who was interested in time travel, the mystic arts and telepathy. He became disfigured after an accident with an experiment caused an explosion. He blamed Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) for what happened. Soon after, he left America and travelled to Tibet where some monks took him in and built him his steel mask and body armour. Eventually and under the name of Dr. Doom, he conquered Latvia and became their new and thoroughly evil ruler. Now, if the above film had bothered to include any of Dr Doom's background, then maybe the viewing experience would have been better. A real stinker in all departments.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
extremely satisfying,"it has been some time this movie has hit the screens. after the recent adaptations of Thor and Captain America, i watched this movie again and felt it deserved a 2nd sequel. With the exception of Alba who had to dye her hair and wear contact lenses, the rest of the cast was almost born to play these roles. the story is believable and has the right dose of humor, action and emotion, while the producers and technicians have done a great job with a relatively low budget. in addition, the soundtrack is well done and the costumes are amazing. the movie overall is very entertaining and it is a pity they stopped the series. i wish there could be more movies like these.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Giving a Piece of the Rock,"Taking its place in the parade of comic book super heroes turned big budget movie, The Fantastic Four was a comic book waiting to be filmed. It had all the right ingredients: interesting characters that had undergone some kind of change giving them super powers, an evil associate that turns completely on those once considered his friends, romance between characters, dazzling, perhaps over-used CGI effects, lots of destruction, humorous super hero when more than one super hero is used at one time, and the list goes on. While it just doesn't have the heart and tenacity of either of the two Spiderman movies or the visual splendor or acting range of the other super hero ensemble X-Men series, The Fantastic Four is a pretty good film that delivers entertainment if nothing else. It should appease the die-hard Fantastic Four fans with its characterizations being very closely done with the comics in mind and the story following much of the comics as well. Ioan Gruffudd plays Reed Richards and brings stability, believability, and presence to what many think is a somewhat thankless role as Mr. Fantastic ""Stretch."" Gruffudd's stable force helps counteract some of the other acting ranges. Jessica Alba plays Sue Storm. She is pretty to be sure - and probably the weakest of the quartet in terms of acting ability. It seems to be really hurting her huh? Yeah, right! She's blonde, she's curvy, and she can really fill out a skin-tight super hero outfit. Johnny Storm is played by the youthful and enthusiastic Chris Evans. His performance is the lighter side of the four and funny. The scene where is is playing with a doll of the Thing was amusing. And that brings us to the best of the four, Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm, the heart and soul of this film. Chiklis gives a lot to this performance and his characterization makes this movie more than just a super hero movie loaded with special effects - which it is but has a bit more to it as well. I really liked the special effects they used with the Thing where director Tim Story(what a great last name for a director!)decided to go with a costume for Grimm rather than make him totally CGI like used in The Hulk. In that film, the Hulk was impersonal and not believable; here, the Thing is very believable and Chiklis is able to act in the suit and show a whole range of emotions. If this process had been used in Ang Lee's mega-disaster, maybe it would have been somewhat decent. OK, I know I am STRETCHING things now. Anyway, The Fantastic Four is a formula super hero movie but an enjoyable one and should spawn many a sequel. And once again, let's give the most credit for this film, Spiderman, the X-Men, and so on where it is due - Thank You so very much Stan Lee!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fantastic 4, Fantastic Film","I never read any Fantastic Four comics, so I cannot tell if the director followed with the comics or not, but all I can tell after watching the movie is that it's better than any MARVEL comics inspired movie that I'd seen (that includes Spiderman).The story has been intricately plot, and makes the characters certainly much better than the cartoon series, if not the comics(which I don't know about). The four guys plus Van Doom, their sponsor, go on a space mission to study human DNA better, but that mission goes haywire, as all of them get exposed to heavy radiation of an unknown kind.Next the story follows, how each of the five come to realize their own powers. Something which gives us more insight on the characters. Special focus is given on 'The Thing' as because of his hideous looks. Also the subtle romance between invisible Girl and Mr.Fanatastic is good to watch, but the action sequences are simply superb. The sequences about dodging the rockets, and the ones between the fight between Doom and Fantastic Four is also very well shot. Torchd is well portrayed as the flamboyant playboy, much like the original story.After watching the movie in the theater however, I realize that this is again a one time movie, just to give you a break from the monotonic day to day life. It doesn't stick to your heart like other movies. But no doubt it's still a great fun watching it. 8/10 from me...",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing,"After the good reviews, I was disappointed in this movie. Several people in the theater laughed openly when the characters were strolling around the space station, briefcase in hand. It was especially funny when Ben Grimm was floating just a few feet away.But to give them credit, the makers of this thing didn't even try to explain it.However, the middle of this movie is LOOOOOONG. It takes too much time for them to develop their powers, even the villain, and it ends with a quick fight at the end that's almost like political correct superheroism because they all have to get involved.Mr. Fantastic was okay, Ben Grimm is the best character in the movie, and the Human Torch is disappointing.Rent it.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really fantastic.,"I have read some of the comments posted in IMDb, I realised this film is not that bad, and not that good. But the positive thing I can say is that it is one of the best superhero flick. Featuring five people going up to space and were changed. I almost watched all the superhero movies, and this is one of my best. There is enough super-effect, action and some humour, and ""wow!"" at the part when Susan storm stripped until her undergarment. I was not bored at all, fancied their superpower, but the story was straight forward so that in some way, the film seemed a bit slow. Needless to say, I hoped the upcoming Fantastic four 2 will better than this one. Overall, I enjoyed this flick, best to eat with popcorn.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Movie should have been more than just SFX and a rushed plot,"I enjoyed the movie as pure entertainment, but nothing more than that. I went into the theater with reasonable to high expectations, but what I ended up with was a rushed movie with no substance. It was very bland and the intelligence factor wasn't present. My perception of the FF4, based on the comics, is a team who exhibits style and aggression on an organizational level, with a little humor added in FF4 style. The comics displayed that flawlessly because that was the point of origin. When being converted into a feature film, execution of the comic idea was only half thought out. I remember somebody on the FF4 IMDb message board stating that the fault of the film's outcome was to blame on the director and crew, but that somebody forgot about the power of Hollywood's studios. You have writers hashing out rushed and mediocre scripts. That is a bore and just plain laziness. SFX don't make a movie, but Hollywood knows that.In my opinion, the story was off from the beginning. Dr. Doom's character was ruined. The studio took one of Marvel's most villainous characters and turned him into a mediocre antagonist. His intelligence and ideas were overshadowed by Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd). Dr. Doom was disfigured in a lab experiment not aboard the same shuttle as the FF4!! Doom is one of the smartest men in the world according to the comics, and he is not easily beaten. I know big screen adaptations don't always follow comic ideas, but if a studio doesn't have enough resources or time, use other options. The mole man villain would've been more suitable. As a matter of fact, the mole man was FF4's first villain.Bland and cheesy acting performances is what the audience is receiving from this movie. The only two characters that exhibited better performances and chemistry were Chris Evans (Johnny Storm) and Michael Chiklis (Ben Grimm). Just like the comics, these two are always at each other's throats. The film interprets that very well. Jessica Alba was not convincing at all. T&A does not save this movie. The casting director made a mistake with this girl. A more suitable actress with credibility and a little more age would've been better for this film. Ioan Gruffudd (Mr. Fantastic) worked with what he was given, but blame the unstructured dialog on the writers. Julian McMahon's demeanor was convincing, but again, the writers for the film made Doom's character very simple.Overall, I'm a little divided with this film. On one hand, you have a very unstructured, weak plot combined with cheesy elements to make a superhero film. And, on the other hand, you have good cinematography with pretty good SFX. Fox studios needs to learn how to combine these elements to make a great film, or otherwise, they will end up with a movie like this. This film was a good idea, but was badly executed. Better luck next time Marvel!!Final Judgement: *1/2/****",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun-tastic!,"This adaptation of the comic is really refreshing, especially this summer. With remakes filling the big screen, it's fun to see something that takes a classic and makes it new again while not alienating its roots. True, you can't take it too seriously, but it was never meant to be serious. It's escapist fantasy and it's just what Hollywood needed to get out of its recent slump. I'd definitely recommend seeing this one. Ioan Gruffudd (a fabulous Welsh actor) does a great job portraying the scientifically minded Reed Richards, Jessica Alba shines as Sue Storm, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans are hilarious as brotherly rivals while Julian McMahon does a great job as the evil Dr. Von Doom. I've seen it once and I'm definitely going back.Have a fantastic summer!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perfectly mediocre,"In a long year of bland movies, lackluster marketing and a series of summer duds, expectations are pretty low for The Fantastic Four. Though it's not as bad as it could have been, it's nowhere near as good as it should have been.The writing is pretty run of the mill stuff. While the script avoids the cringing embarrassment of Daredevil, neither the plot nor the characterization stands out as anything beyond average. There seems to have been a struggle between Michael Francis' desire for emotion and realism, and Mark Frost's popular sense of how to get a story moving. Writing by committee rarely works and the two's strengths cancel each other out. The result is a story that lacks any surprise or tension, populated by characters with no depth or motivation.A good director and great actors can sometimes save a mediocre script, but here we have neither. Tim Story seems way out of his depth dealing with a movie of this scale. Where there should be no-holds-barred, jaw-dropping spectacle, we have action scenes that play like a rerun of The Dukes of Hazard. Many scenes simply run on too long, the characters are left standing around wondering what to do next, and the whole movie has an oddly sedate pacing to it. The actors struggle to bring life to such lazily written, one-dimensional characters. Nobody is expecting King Lear in a comic-book movie, but a little depth of character and believable motivation goes a long way to make us care about what is going on. Michael Chiklis brings a humanity to The Thing that steals every scene in which he appears, but he has the advantage of having a clearly identifiable 'disability' to milk for emotional effect.The CGI seems decidedly third rate, as though the project was given to the trainees to do between the priority assignments. It's rare to see something as simple as a ship floating in space look so unrealistic, and the more complex effects, particularly with Reed Richards' stretching, were terrible. Johnny Storm's motion capture was amateurish, close-ups of his face while engulfed in flame being particularly bad. The Thing never looked like anything but latex, and in many scenes you could actually see the rubber creasing at the joints. Its design gave no sense of real solidity and never for a moment do you believe that he is made of stone.Overall, from the script to the performances to the visual effects, Fantastic Four reeks of a low-priority project put into the hands of individuals who aren't quite ready for the responsibility. Maybe we've finally come to the point where $100 million just isn't enough to successfully pull off this kind of movie any more.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Can't wait to you tell us that Jessica Alba deserves a supporting Oscar nomination for her role, Chiklis should chuck being the Shield due to his great perf. as Ben Grimm, and that this rewrote the book on action movies.

"Good for the genre, but where was Goth Guy?","Of the numerous comic book heroes that have been adapted for the big screen lately, I found this one possibly the best. Admittedly by their very nature, attempts to adapt youthful fantasy into live action film is a venture fraught with peril. The ""take it or leave it"" finality of live action that won't insult the images formed by us early on is surely difficult for any production team to pull off. And lets face it. Stan Lee is to comics-books what Tolkien was to high fantasy. In a wise move, Stan Lee himself was there to lend his own touch to the finished product, a move which is probably responsible for the ease with which I was able to accept the characters. The special effects were fine, with no inconsistencies glaring enough to yank me out of the story-line.I was however quite disappointed to have found the ""Goth Guy"" scene gone from the final cut (or at least the one I saw here in Canada). I had heard somewhere that Preston Peet was ""a sight to behold!""....and certainly one I was looking forward to seeing, judging by the description given me. It sounds to me like it should have stayed in the final cut, so hopefully it'll be returned in some future CD/DVD release? Maybe just as an out-take perhaps?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
F4 needs a pity point just to make 4 stars.,"I had hoped that Hulk and the last of the old Batman movies would have served as the gold standards for how NOT to make a superhero movie. So many high hopes horribly dashed. Curse Batman Begins and Spiderman for upping the ante if you will, but it seems that some directors and studios understand that a superhero movie should live up to both ""superhero"" and ""movie"". Sadly, F4 does neither.The characters are as two dimensional as comic-book paper. They do things because the script writing team says they should. The script writers write these things because it sets up set pieces where things explode or the CGI machines get turned on or the *cough* plot is advanced. This all leads to big trailers and tie ins with toys and kids meals. On screen none of it feels realistic in the least.Why was Spiderman good? Because we empathized with Peter. When he made decisions, we understood why. None of the characters in F4 are people you never care about any of them, so the action scenes carry no weight. There is no growth, no chemistry and groan-level humor is slathered on like whip cream in an attempt to cover it all up.The villain is uninspired. You felt neither empathy nor fear, his plot to yadda-yadda was yawn and etc and who cares. The goofiest Batman TV show had better villain plots.I would go on, but honestly if the writers couldn't be bothered, neither can I. If you want a good superhero team movie, I suggest you buy ""Incredibles"". The special features section of that DVD is a better superhero movie than all of F4.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Comic-Book-To-Film Goes Fantastic,"There are serious SF films then there are entertaining SF films and, as of late, the film industry has seen fit to adapt several comic book SF characters onto the silver screen. Whether or not these are serious or entertaining is often left up to the viewer's discretion. Some have been great (Spiderman) and some not-so-great (Catwoman). Then we have this movie, the FANTASTIC FOUR.Debuting in 1961 (Marvel Comics), the Fantastic Four hit on new ground: a dysfunctional family of sorts who fight amongst themselves as much as they do against the forces of evil. Unable to decide on costumes, they really had none for several episodes. All of them gained their superpowers from exposure to cosmic rays while visiting a space-station.Jump to 2005 and we get the entire dysfunctional dynamic rolled into a 105 minute film; not an easy task. But director Tim Story does an admirable job with writers Mark Frost and Michael France's screenplay. The space-station, the problems with costumes, the infighting, it's all there (thus my positive rating).The beautiful Jessica Alba stars as the sexy, kick-a$$ Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman. Her powers include the ability to manipulate matter and light. Chris Evans (whom I'd personally give top billing) brings to life the role of Johnny Storm/The Human Torch, Sue's immature younger brother who can spark up any room with his powers and his wit. And Mr. Evans instills some much needed comedy into the flick by playing pranks on the other three as well as having some great dialogue. Ioan Gruffudd bends the silver screen as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, the flexible rubberman who is the defacto leader of the Fantastic Four (and who's also in love with Sue Storm). Then we have Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who's increased mass and stone-like structure have given him incredible strength and some problems at home. He's uneffectually called The Thing and his wife leaves him posthaste when she discovers his altered physical structure.The great thing about the film is that it really looks at the issues surrounding being a newly developed superhero and how people might respond to such a thing. For one thing, when Ben Grimm's wife leaves him, she pulls off her wedding ring and Ben/The Thing tries to pick it up but can't because of his bulky hands. It's actually a fairly touching scene and we can feel Ben's frustration. Also there's the lost love between Sue Storm and Reed Richards which is always in the background and causes flare-ups and fights constantly. Then there's Johnny Storm's discovery of his flaming superpowers and his difficulty in controlling them (or lack of wanting to control them). He's a cocky upstart who brings an entirely new dynamic to the group which is why I'd give him top billing.The film's faults are easily seen as we're rushed through certain aspects (how they plan to get back to normal using a machine created by Richard) and several convenient plot twists (not uncommon, though, for comic books).This is a fun film. It's not at the level of Spiderman, but it's way, way above Catwoman.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a great surprise,"Not really wanting to see this film as I had heard nothing but bad things about it and already having a lot of my childhood faves destroyed by the Hollywood grinding machine I sat down to watch with every intension of hating it. But to my confession I have to emit that this is a really good fun summer movie worthy everybody viewing and respect. It's got it's down point sure, but I don't want to go into that just yet as I also don't want to give and of the plot away (well what there is of a plot anyway. The best surprise was how each of the actors playing the Fantastic Four really tried there hardest to nail there charters (even with the not so good adjusted back story) Michael Chiklis standing out as The Thing Ben Grim. He just seem to get the guy an example being that he would standing up for the geeky Reed Richards one minute and then be bullying him the next. And I couldn't help but tingle when he used his catch phase (It's clobbering Time). The only charter that was sort of Pete Tong wrong was Dr Doom. For starter's he was American (If you read the comic book you'll that thats just wrong) and his origin was changed. He seemed to go kind of nuts for no real reason and I don't no what he hoped to gain by trying to kill the F4 team. Dr Doom little subplot was lifed straight from spider made (Man looses his company control from the Board of directors, Man kills the Board). I'm going to try and make the few bad point short and sweet. The Effect were pretty thin (No pun intended) When reed stretched his body just has cheep as chips CGI written all over it. And there seem to be big chunks missing from the plot (How did the get back from the mission in space let alone to Quarantine and didn't Dr Doom get stuck in there as well). Enough of downers I'd like to finish on a positive note. Plus point of this film is it's got some good witty humour lifted from the comic book and the main characters interact just like in the book. Everyone seem's to picking on Reed even though he's the leader of the team and on top of that Jonny gives a lot of stick to Ben. Again this ain't the greatest of comic book adaptations nor is it dark like Batman or charter driven like Spider-man and Hulk. But It is Fun, sometimes exciting, Funny, sexy in place's and all round summer fun that even none F4 fans can enjoy.

A huge disappointment unless this is the first movie you watch. Ever.,"The reason that I just had to write my own review was all these 10 star reviews that plague the comments area, leading the unsuspected viewer to think that this is a new movies classic, able to surpass the Godfather or Ran. If you are a teen who thinks that Dumb and Dumber 2 had an interesting plot and Jessica Alba and Julian McMahon are enough to make you pay a ticket for this movie, then you might actually enjoy this. Being a FF and comic heroes/scifi fan in general, I joined the rest of the herd into the cinema to see one of the worst, if not THE worst movie with the ""Marvel Comics"" logo showing at the beginning of it. The plot has more holes than swiss cheese. The jokes are boring and are thrown to our faces way too often just in case you missed them the previous 20 times they were used. Yes Torch boy, you're hot, we get it, ha ha. The Thing carries the burden of a comic relief and you find yourself laughing at a slapstick comedy, only that the Three Stooges did it much better.*********** spoilers ***********I mean seriously, let's just think of the scene at the bridge. Everyone just happened to be on that bridge at the same time. Thing's mates were there just when he needed them and guess what, his wife too! How convenient. One would believe that everyone lives and works at the bridge. The firemen acted like stupid rag dolls and when the firetruck was hanging on the edge of the bridge, everyone rushed towards the wrong part, probably thinking ""the weird rock-skin fella will save us"". And the stupidity just went on. ""Become invisible and go help him."". A few moments later our heroes find themselves close to him. ""It's a good think you became invisible and we got here"". So, in a nutshell, she became invisible, pushed aside a couple of cops saying ""coming through, excuse me"", they all walked there and she became visible again. Yyyyeah. The story between Reed and Sue is cheesy, boring and half the movie revolves around it. It's like a soap opera with a really weird couple. Johnny is a silly guy who's on a quest to become famous the easy way and he's a character that no one really cares about. His ability to imitate a match is an endless source of supposedly funny lines repeated every now and than, like ""- You're on fire. - I know. - No, you're actually on fire."" Ha ha ha. But the quality humor continues. Ben's story line could be interesting but after 40 seconds of dealing with the love of his life, it's all reduced to 30 (at least) unoriginal and predictable jokes about him being too heavy and too strong. Dr.Doom is no better than the rest of the bunch. He becomes evil just because it's in the script. He loses his job, a few hair, gets a scar, superhuman strength and he decides that it's time to conquer the world using his secret weapons, ultra boredom and super whining. I was expecting to see him in a handicap match versus Ben and Reed, with Sue cheering in a bikini and Johnny holding a chair, waiting for a chance to give a sneak hit with it, but no, they just had to go for a boring 4 minute fighting scene in the end which is less exciting than watching a couple of baboons sleeping at the zoo.********** no more spoilers :) *********There are probably a zillion movies that you haven't seen but you need to. This is not one of them, it's a complete waste of time. It's the best example of Hollywood exploiting an idea and actors favorite to teenagers to make money. On the bright side, there's no Justin Timberlake or Jessica Simpson in it, so it could be worst. Steer away at all costs.

It's simple. It's direct. And it doesn't suck (unlike this review).What do you expect? It's not a performance movie, it's not a character driven movie and it certainly doesn't hold any plot above the standard superhero comic adaptations.

Solid fun but falls a bit short.,"I'm in my mid-fifties and a huge fan of comic book movies. I love it when Hollywood brings my favorite comic book heroes to life on the big screen using state of the art technology to convince me of their reality.F4 succeeds in the CGI and effects department. I was somewhat concerned when I learned that ""The Thing"" would be done with a prosthetic suit instead of CGI, but I think it was pulled off nicely due, in no small part, to Michael Chiklis' characterization.Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richarsds was visually acceptable, but was a bit of a milquetoast compared to the character in the comic book.Jessica Alba as Sue Storm I found to be more than acceptable. Perhaps a bit too buff compared to the comic's character, I nonetheless found Alba's interpretation of Sue Storm to be exotic and endearing. If a franchise develops, I hope Alba returns as The Invisible Girl.Chris Evans may have been born to play Johnny Storm. He was perfect as the 'cocky young guy' and brings to mind Chris O'Donnell's performance as ""Robin"" in the Batman franchise. Evans obviously had a lot of fun playing the character and should definitely be tapped to return if a franchise develops.Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom was respectable, and I would not balk should he return in the role. However...Where this film fell short for me was the story itself. The first part of the film did well in presenting the basic facts of how the Fantastic Four gained their abilities. And I even understand that for a 'first of the franchise' type of film that certain elements of each of the characters had to be presented in a way that remained true to the comic. Still, though, when the film reached it's grand finale battle with Dr. Doom, I found myself thinking ""Is that it?"" And it was...the end of the film, and I felt let down.While I felt that all of the basics of the story had been presented and the SFX were on mark, the story fell short of creating a truly ominous villain in the character of Dr. Doom. This was not the actor's fault. The blame is squarely on the director and screenwriter. Dr. Doom was far too easy to thwart! Whenever Victor Von Doom was on the screen there was no sense of foreboding and evil. In the comics I remember Dr. Doom as a nearly omnipotent force of evil. In this film Dr. Doom is just a man with a few quirks. And he was far, far, far too easy to thwart! Without a truly ominous and evil Dr. Doom the characters of the Fantastic Four had no credible foil to play against, and thus their characterizations were diminished.Still, though certainly not a high-water mark in the genre, Fantastic Four is solid entertainment and a lot of fun. But, should the franchise continue, I think the director would be wise to first become a TRUE fan of the original comic, second watch and study every film by Sam Peckinpah, Steven Spielberg and John Frankenheimer, and third forget about ratings, the 'kiddies' and family fare, but instead make a film that tells a knuckle-whitening story as do the comics.There have been many films where it is easy to say that the SFX did not serve the story. In this film the story did not serve the SFX.5 stars out of 10 for SFX, and Jessica Alba. Add two stars for Michael Chiklis as ""The Thing"". Verdict: 7 out of 10 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't bother,"This movie doesn't even do a decent job of being bad. The flat script, the contrived plot, the brain-rotting ""science,"" the cardboard characters: the whole schmeer is just one great big fused cliché ground out of the Marvel/Hollywood cliché machine. And that's it. From the typography of the opening titles to the point where I walked out of the theatre, I found the film to be dull, hackneyed, laboured, predictable and inane.Michael Chiklis could act, given half a script; Chris Evans is good when he has his shirt off and his mouth firmly shut; The Thing has genuine pathos; and the special effects are seamless and convincing. But these few glimmers of quality are nowhere near enough to redeem the movie.But hey, maybe I was just having a bad day.

An Outrage For Fans of the Fantastic Four,"The magic and majesty of the Fantastic Four franchise is tarnished for all time with this poor excuse for a motion picture incarnation. Lacking in everything necessary and required of a super hero movie, this is a film that never captures one's imagination. This is basically because it is unimaginative, hackneyed, and dull. The actors who portray the legendary characters seem to all believe that just wearing a costume will suffice and nothing else is needed. There is no heart or soul to these beings and they have no charisma or dynamics. As far as special effects, this production supposedly had a 100 million dollar budget. That's $100,000,000! Where exactly did all that money go? It sure doesn't appear to have been spent in the making of The Fantastic Four: The Flop.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
flawed but fun,"It's an origins story so the good vs evil battle takes second place to watching the team develop from ordinary people into superheroes. Watching them get through their conflicts and deal with each other's personality quirks as they gel into the Fantastic Four is fun and more interesting than if the movie had been ONLY action, action, and more action. It's not perfect. The screenwriters didn't make Jessica Alba into a convincing scientist and they didn't make the development of the bad guy from ordinary jerk into evil monster all that convincing either (I don't blame the actors for these flaws). The acting and writing for The Thing is especially compelling. The movie does what it sets out to do (I don't expect a superhero movie to be a life-changing experience) and is enjoyable with a few flaws so it gets a 7 rating - the most common so far for this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Guys guys guys, this was expected.","Come on guys, We all knew this would flop.Batman had a chance and succeeded because Christopher Nolan directed it and the film tried to become somewhat realistic.This on the other hand was just trash we have all seen before. I mean it was like textbook generic.*sigh*Marvel hits and misses now and then. But here's a major reason why this failed: Nobody likes the fantastic four.Poor acting, poor scripting, just such a stupid movie.But again, this disappointment was just as ominous and foreshadowed as Hitchhikers guide was (even though Hitchhikers wasn't AS big of a disappointment as i thought it'd be).-Danny K2xLgames.com",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four Stars!!!!!,This movie really was fantastic! I don't think the critics have ever been more wrong about a film by saying this wasn't good. It was awesome! It had a great cast. It was funny. It had great action and great special effects. I thought it was better than both X- Men films. I don't think this summer has that many great movies other than Batman Begins. I thought the cast was perfect and there wasn't a minute of the film where I was bored by them. The effects were amazing including The Thing played by Michael Chiklis who filmed the whole film in the actual costume. Jessica Alba was hot as always. Chris Evans was really funny. Ioan Gruffudd did a great job and should be well known for this role and Julian McMahon from Nip/Tuck was so awesome as Dr. Doom. He was one of the best parts about the film. This movie was one of the best I have seen recently along with Batman Begins and Sin City. This movie proves that critics are not always right and you should judge for yourself without reading reviews. If there is one film you shouldn't miss this summer it's Fantastic Four!,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) once kiddie fiddled one too many cub scouts of America and enjoys adding extra paprika to the food.

Fantastic Fun,"'Fantastic Four', I believe, is the most underrated of all the superhero movies, by far. People compared it to Spider-Man too much, probably because it was the first Marvel movie to come out since Spider-Man 2, and they missed the point of FF. 'Four', directed well by Tim Story, is not supposed to be as dramatic and intense as SP2, but rather just a fun, catchy, and addictive movie, which it is.The story is like this: 4 scientists, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), her brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), are launched up to the new space station to record the affects of a cosmo storm with the man who is funding the expedition, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). Instead of recording the affects, the storm gives them the effects first had. The five of them receive astonishing powers and abilities, and in Grimm's case, it's not pretty. Soon, Von Doom disappears into seclusion, but the other four soon become known to the media as The Fantastic Four! The special effects are top notch, especially all the scenes with Johnny Storm, aka The Human Torch. There are a ton of computer shots in the film, but you won't be able to tell with most of them, because the rendering and editing is very good. It's a decent story, but I wish there had been more crime fighting then there was. Tim Story does do a nice job of showing how the newfound mutations affect each of the character's lives, including Von Doom. The writing is decent, but once again, I wish there was more crime fighting. The direction is great, as I've said before. The acting is what you'd expect from a movie like this, not good, but not bad. The best portrayals are from Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans, as they capture the aura of their characters very well. The worst is Von Doom, who is nowhere near as cool as he is in the comics. McMahon is the right guy for the role, he just needs to read up on the character and give him more anger. Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba play their roles reasonably well, but you don't get the feeling from Gruffudd that Reed is the leader of the group, because as Mr. Fantastic, he is. All in all, I enjoy FF whenever I watch it. There is no language at all, and there's a lot of funny lines and cool scenes that kids will enjoy. FF is good for kids ages 11 and up. Not as good as Spider-Man, but better than Hulk and Daredevil.8/10 --spy",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
For sure one of the worst movies ever...,"This movie hasn't got one single good thing going for it. Not one.It's bad from the start and the total lack of story in this one is amazing. Even Argmageddon is better than this one, and that says a lot! I almost stopped the film when i watched it but since it's fairly short me and my brother spent the last part, laughing through it.The worst thing about this movie though, is that Chiklis stars in it. To have gone from a truly fantastic series like ""the Shield"" to do this...talk about bad judgment. One can just hope that this (and also Fantastic 4, number 2) was a temporary dip to get into the movie industry. Lets hope Chiklis instead goes into some serious film-making, which I think he would do excellent.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not Batman, but not bad...","I went in this movie with low, very low expectations and thus came out pleasantly surprised.Is this movie good? It depends. It doesn't all click together but it is good entertainment. My theater was full when I went and a loud applause came from the audience at the end. Everyone I went with liked it, and I heard several little boys wanting to see it again. That's probably the best demographic to be to enjoy this movie, but other age groups will find a fun-popcorn flick that you won't feel you've wasted your money on.The best thing about the movie is the dynamic between the actors. They feel like what they're supposed to feel like: a bickering but loving family, and all the actors, especially Evans and Chiklis do a good job. I don't know much about the comics, but you do get a very good sense of their personalities. The only weak link would be Gruffud, which I'm sorry to say because I really liked him in Horatio Hornblower. Mr. Fantastic's just sort a boring character in this movie.Another great thing about the movie is the humour. Batman was better overall, but it had a dryness that did hinder it from being truly enjoyable. This is where FF truly delivers. Most of the humour comes from Evans who is outstanding at hitting the right notes to make people laugh.The weak point of the movie was the plot. There was no plot. There was the setup, and then Dr. Doom decides to kill them. That's it. No master plan, no ingenuity. Nothing. It really felt lacking. Somebody mentioned spoilers. I don't see how you could spoil the movie. It's very straightforward and rather predictable.However, I always rate movies on how I enjoy them overall and I give it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly entertaining.,"""Fantastic Four"" (2005) Dir. Tim Story Going into ""Fantastic Four"", I had absolutely no expectations, no good ones at least. I thought the trailers made the film look like a cheesy and dreadful mess and I was certain I would completely loathe this movie and it would turn out to be one of the year's worst films.As can be expected, this movie is not perfect, due to the main problem in blockbusters these days - the script. While there are some witty lines, some great comedic humour and a simple yet effective overall storyline, ""Four"" suffers from some truly awful one-liners. Lines that particularly stuck out in my head after viewing were ""no, LETS!"" from Jessica Alba's Invisible Woman and ""the day...of the FANTASTIC FOUR!"" from Chris Evans' Human Torch. These one-liners will no doubt have the majority of viewers cringing in their seats, instead of on their feet cheering - which was probably the director's intent.""Four"" also has some strange pacing. Though the movie remains entertaining through it's entirety, I couldn't help but feel that Victor Von Doom (played by ""Nip/Tuck""'s Julian McMahon) came into play too late into the film. He made for a nasty and cool villain, and should've been used more effectively. His sequence where he intends to destroy the Fantastic Four group at the end of the movie is one of the movie's highlights as Von Doom really gets into the meat of the story and McMahon goes all-out, and he plays his part with glee and seems to be having a lot of fun. Since his material is some of the movie's strongest, he could've perhaps been incorporated more into the film's mid-section, though this is a flaw that didn't bother me nearly that much because it was simply just great to see McMahon, one of my favourite TV actors, on the big screen.As for the rest of the cast, Ioan Gruffudd has never been much of an actor (he was very mediocre in ""102 Dalmatians"" and last year's disaster ""King Arthur"") and he doesn't do much to further his reputation in ""Four"". He seems to flounder under the pressure of his first lead male role, and just doesn't convince as the big-man leader of this group at all. His awkward American accent also gets irritating after mere minutes.It is thankful that the rest of the cast give much better performances than Gruffudd, McMahon already mentioned as a fantastically evil Von Doom, Alba strutting her stuff looking damn fine and in an enjoyable role as The Invisible Girl. Evans makes an impression with enthusiasm and charisma, and I liked that his younger character saw the upside of these powers rather than showing them as a burden ALA almost everyone else in the film, but it is a shame that time is wasted on his character doing silly extreme sports. They just feel like a way to try and get the attention of teenagers and even though I've never read the comic book in my life, I severely doubt that Human Torch had anything to do with extreme sports in them which was quite annoying.Michael Chiklis absolutely steals the show and gives a sympathetic performance as The Thing. It is a credit to Chiklis' performance that underneath all the (amazing!) make-up, Chiklis still makes this ""monster"" a very humane and likable character, whom we can sympathise with throughout the film. I've never seen Chiklis on ""The Shield"" before but I wouldn't mind seeing him in some more feature films as he impressed me a lot with his role in ""Four"".I loved the media-coverage side of the movie, which expanded on similar themes in ""Spider-Man"" (""Four"" is quite similar to ""Spider-Man"" - Von Doom is a better Green Goblin), it was a nice original touch in a not-all-that-original-really movie. With Evans' Johnny Storm truly loving the media and lapping up all the attention he can get, while his sister (Alba) truly can't stand and the group overall feels the need to stay locked up away from public, it seems to mirror different sorts of celebrities, which was clever and entertaining to watch.The action sequences in this movie are not quite phenomenal, and there may not be as many as you think. They're not BAD action sequences but ""Four"" also has a lot of comedic material and even (shock-horror!) some character development so the big action sequences come at the end of the film. This is a pretty spectacular final battle against McMahon, with each of the Four getting to use their stunning powers against him. The ideas of the superpowers are utilised to their full potential in both the action sequences and in some humorous scenes (Gruffudd's power in particular - watching him wrap himself around Chiklis and Evans reaction to him reaching under a door and undoing the lock are both very funny). The special effects are realistic while also maintaining a cool comic-book edge throughout the movie.Coming out, I was extremely surprised, in fact overwhelmed, at how much I had enjoyed ""Four"". I'm still sort of shocked I actually liked it as much as I did seeing as I thought I was absolutely sure to hate it. ""Four"" was more than twice as good as I had expected, making it one of the year's biggest surprises.8/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A waste of time and special effects,"This movie was a great disappointment. After the wonderful translations of Spiderman and X-Men to the big screen, I was hopeful that the Fantastic Four would get similar treatment. Alas, it was not to be. Poor casting choices (Jessica Alba was simply not the right choice for the role of Susan Storm and who was that actor playing Von Doom??), a lack of continuity (things happened in the second half which simply made no sense), and a villain whose motives were confusing and nonsensical (was it all really just for money? revenge? if so, for what?).The special effects were pretty darn good, but they simply sat there because there was no plot to back them up.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What's with the negative reviews?,"You know, I am getting pretty repulsed by all of the negative feedback from this movie. I have seen it and thought that all of the actors excelled in their performances. Granted Julian McMahon is a television actor and rarely makes it to the big screen, he still gave a great effort, and, in my opinion, truly brought forth the true Dr. Doom from the comics: a friend to Reed Richards, a lover to Ms. Storm, and an untrusted foe by the two other characters. Even though in the comics Dr. Doom never gained true superpowers and was the filthy rich ruler of some foreign nation, the film adaption successfully created an amazing back story for an excellent movie. I think we should applaud the actors/actresses and the crew on a job-well-done.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic or...,"I think there are basically two kinds of comic book movies. I love comic book movies, which actually have meaning. Daredevil, Spider-man 1 & 2 & Batman Begins are {meaningful}, intelligent pictures, which are self-sufficient even apart from their comic book origins. They are actually a kind of comic book based movies, that I like. Yet, we have another type of comic book movies: more cartooned, more ""comic"" to say so: Hellboy, Sin City, Punisher... Fantastic Four definitely belongs to the second group of films, yet I liked it way better than the three above-mentioned movies in this {cartooned} group. The acting in Fantastic Four is great. Especially Michael Chiklis, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans & Julian McMahon are doing an awesome job. Unfortunately the characters are too undeveloped to make the best out of their talent. The visuals are great, but we do have major problems with the direction of Tim Story, as well as with the story itself. While during the first half of the movie I was sitting & thinking like ""Wow! I'm sure gonna buy this movie"", in the second half I was like ""Hmm... Not a bad movie to see one time"" The film seems too rushed, characters are not well written & some supposed plot twists are rather questionable & primitive at best. Unbelievably, but the involvement of Chris Columbus in the project is felt throughout the movie. The production seems childish at times, though the humor is very good. Did I enjoy the movie? Kinda yes. Eye-catching visuals, funny jokes & charismatic actors work well. Will I put Fantastic Four on the shelf together with my licensed copies of Daredevil, Spider-man, Spider-man 2 &, soon, Batman Begins? Definitely NOT!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not too bad, but far from good","First, let me say that I'm not sorry I went to see this movie. I've been to see all the recent crop of Marvel universe based movies and, while some are better than others, I haven't regretted one, and will continue to go see whatever Marvel and the studios give me. Yes, I am a sheep.All of these movies have fallen, in my humble opinion, into two groups: the really good, and the poor to not so good. Before FF opened, I hoped it would break the monopoly on the ""really good"" group held by the X-Men (1 & 2) and Spiderman (mostly 2.)Well, we can't have everything we want, now can we? FF is firmly in the middle of the ""poor to not so good"" group. Mildly entertaining. Four stars (no pun intended.)I won't rehash the plot, as more than enough other commenters have done that quite adequately before me. My complaint is that the story, the script, and the acting for this film are all bland and mediocre, with only two particular exceptions.Story-wise, it is all extremely straightforward; no twists, no surprises, nothing remotely thought-provoking. Ten minutes into the movie, you know exactly what is going to happen all the way through to the end. The first exception is here: there is one story point (which comes very near the end of the film) that was not altogether obvious until 20 or 30 minutes in.The acting was almost universally flat. Emotionally important lines had an air of boredom, and joyful lines were merely glib. The second exception is here: there has been much made of Michale Chiklis's performance as Ben Grimm, and it is somewhat deserved. I have no doubt that Chiklis may be fine actor (I have seen none of his other work) but his performance here was second rate. All of second, mind you, no worse. It was a competent, adequate performance which shone only by comparison. (Stan Lee makes his customary cameo appearance, and is perhaps the most animated actor on the screen.)The script was altogether uninteresting, without exception. Watch the trailer or read the ""Memorable Quotes"" page here on IMDb. It is likely you will ask ""Is that the best they could come up with?"" Yes, it is.Still, as I said, I'm not sorry I went to see it. And, as I said, I will continue to go see whatever comes out. There has been much speculation that FF2 (or whatever the sequel will be called) will be better now that the character establishment is out of the way. I sure hope that's right.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
fun but not fantastic,"Respectable but unremarkable comic book adaptation about four astronauts whose ordinary lives takes a drastic turn when a routine mission exposes them to cosmic radiation. Having been endowed with superhuman abilities, they must band together and take on megalomaniacal business tycoon-turned-deadly supervillain Dr. Doom (McMahon). The special effects are a real treat, but the script fails to distinguish itself from more recent comic book adaptations leaving you with that seen-it-all-before feeling. Probably would have worked better with a stronger cast, though everybody does try. Worth watching, but never really memorable. **",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good! Silly but fun.,"Fantastic Four/2005/***Main Stars: Ioan Gruffudd Michael Chiklis Chris Evans Jessica Alba Julian McMahonI really was looking forward to this movie and it was good! Of course, it was not as good as I thought it would be. I really thought this would be the movie of the summer. That's the reason why I saw the movie the first day it came out- July 8, 2005. This movie has a lot of what audiences want to see- action, some humor, and drama. It did have about one or two scenes of romance but who cares? In this movie, there are five scientists (Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), and Susan Storm (Jessica Alba). All five of them are affected by rays caused by a (I won't tell you what the rays were caused by) that changed their tendencies and gave them super powers. But, unfortunately one of the scientists turned bad on the other four scientists. As you probably know from the previews or if you read the comics, the scientists have nicknames now that they have powers. Ben Grimm is The Thing, Reed Richards is Mr. Fantastic, Johnny Storm is Human Torch, Susan Storm is Invisible Woman, and don't forget about Victor Von Doom being Dr. Doom. Dr. Doom kills a few innocent people (one he wanted to get his revenge on for sacking him) in this movie and also has an evil plan to eliminate the Fantastic Four. This movie has spectacular effects that drive you insane. No one could ever hate this non-stop dramatic, comedic, thriller. Every actor/actress in this movie played their parts fantastically well. I'm going to say this though that ""Batman Begins"" tops this movie for sure but this was fantastically well-acted, etc. but it just wasn't what I thought it would be- the most fantastic movie of the summer.

Sin City, although the mood evoked was accurate to the comics, had creativity, and that goes a long way. Also, I don't think it was a coincidence that the three characters that did NOT turn into a monster all looked like supermodels. Again, quite predictable.

Very disappointing.,"This should have great. The Fantastic Four aren't the X-Men, but they still have a respectable mythology to draw from. They have the power of the four elements! Together, they can make anything! And there was a space ship! Instead, the script just didn't pop.The acting was spotty, at best. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis did a fine job; both very believable as sudden superheroes. But Alba and Gruffudd were just phoning it in, and McMahon didn't seem to have a coherent idea of his character.It had some moments, especially when they let the special effects people do their thing. But it should have been the story of how a villain and a team of superheroes become who they are. While the situation is fantastic, the emotional reality is utterly real. In these days of lone heroes and anti-heroes, telling the story of the creation team gives a film maker an opportunity to explore something relatively fresh. Instead, it was about five people more or less randomly walking through life.Did like the Stan Lee walk on.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Better than you assumed,"Every once in a while, and with comics-based movies in particular, fandom-at-large makes a unilateral decision to hate a film that won't be released for months. Science has yet to explain how this phenomenon occurs, although we're pretty sure that Harry Knowles is involved. Such a case is Fantastic Four. For several months now, Internet fandom has been condemning it sight unseen, holding it up as an example of how a comics film should not be made, all based on a few promotional images.Well, the movie is actually out now, and guess what? It's not bad at all. It is, in fact, pretty good. It's not brilliant film-making, and it won't be making any ""ten best of the year"" lists, but it really doesn't set out to do so. The only job this project had was to bring a classic, fun, somewhat goofy superhero comic to the screen, and the translation is more or less perfect. Anyone who feels that the four central characters are lacking anything is reading way too much into the comics.It is, of course, going to be compared to the great superhero films like Superman, Spider-Man, and X2. However, the one movie this compares most closely to is probably Ghostbusters. While rarely outright comedy, it keeps a light tone, and chooses to focus on character-based moments rather than action. Anyone expecting two hours of The Thing kicking holy butt is going to be disappointed. This is a movie based, almost to a fault, on the tone of the classic Lee/Kirby comics of the sixties. The group squabbles amongst themselves, struggles to find their identities, copes with sudden celebrity, and does the right thing for no reason other than that it's the right thing.What works here is that Michael France, Mark Frost and Tim Story know these characters. From the first moment they're on screen, anybody who's a fan will recognize them. They've been perfectly captured, and many of the moments from the classic issues that made these characters who they are are transcribed almost exactly.While the film-makers are slavishly faithful to the heroes, the villain took a bit more rejiggering. I believe they've done a decent job of making Doctor Doom fit into the story more naturally, but it will probably be the hardest pill for fans to swallow. His transition from self-obsessed corporate raider and jilted lover to straight-out supervillain is a bit rocky, and could have used a bit more work.Speaking of rocky, The Thing's look has been the subject of much disdain. The issue of bodysuit vs CGI probably isn't going away anytime soon, but I have to champion the suit. It looks decent enough, and Chiklis' ability to perform through it is impressive. A CGI character would have robbed us of his physical performance, and the other actors' ability to play off of him. The interactions between Chiklis and Chris Evans as Johnny Storm are particularly good.In the end, this is not a movie that will challenge anyone's preconceptions of what a comics translation ought to be, and it isn't on the artistic level of Donner's Superman or Raimi's Spider-Man 2. It's a light, fun and very entertaining adaptation of a light, fun, very entertaining comic. I'd call that a success.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This silver screen adaptation did not catch my attention when it was released in 2005, but sometime last year, I watched the 2007 sequel, ""4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"", thinking it was the original 2005 release. This was obviously a little confusing for me. The original made more sense to me when I watched it afterwards, but it still wasn't very entertaining.A scientist named Reed Richards believes that clouds of cosmic energy cause evolution, and he and his friend, astronaut Ben Grimm, seek funding for a space voyage to study a cosmic energy cloud which Earth will soon be passing. Von Doom Industries CEO Dr. Victor Von Doom agrees to support this mission, and takes along two other employees: his chief genetics researcher and Reed's ex-girlfriend, Susan Storm; and her brother, the excitable Johnny Storm. The mission does not work out as planned, and the five of them are all exposed to cosmic radiation! They all make it back to Earth alive, but one by one, they discover that the radiation has altered their DNA! Reed can now stretch himself like elastic, Sue has the ability to become invisible, Johnny can ignite his body and fly, and Ben becomes a super-strong, rock-like being. Victor has also been affected by the radiation, and with his new powers, he becomes the enemy of the other four!My biggest complaint about this movie might be Johnny Storm, played here by Chris Evans. I don't know what this character is like in the comics, but in this movie, he's such an idiot! The part where he flirts with a nurse and very quickly ends up taking her on a ski trip is stupid, even if it's mildly humorous at times (intentionally). Johnny does some stupid things, and is a very unlikable, arrogant character. This definitely helps sink the film. There are some poorly crafted physical fights between the main characters, unsurprisingly including one between Johnny and Ben, but also one between Reed and Ben. The dialogue is fairly weak at times, such as in one argument scene between Reed and Sue. Another problem (as if there aren't already enough) is the story, which takes too long to get to the main problem, and there aren't too many battle scenes. Clearly, the script could have been better, and could have made a better movie. Also, Ben Grimm/The Thing might be the only character who really stands out.This comic book movie isn't terrible, and it may have some mildly exciting moments. The special effects are obviously very pleasing to the eye, which you can expect from these high-budget modern blockbusters. However, the visuals are not enough to make up for all the flaws, and for the most part, there's really not a lot of excitement at all. Even though this film spawned a sequel just two years after its release, it's certainly not one of the most highly praised films in its genre, and that's perfectly understandable. Some love this adaptation of ""Fantastic Four"" and some hate it, but if you ask me, it's mediocre. Worse comic book movies have definitely come from Hollywood in the past ten years (a time when lots of them have been made), but so have much better ones, even if most of them aren't masterpieces. So, if you want good adrenaline-inducing modern superhero movie, I think you will have to look elsewhere.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic? Not quite......,"The fantastic four is no way as good as it could of been but that isn't the fault of the director as many fanboys seem to think. No, its all down to a poor script . The script just whizzes through everything very superficially like the introductions of the characters ,development of characters and plot development .The script also lacks the sense of urgency of the x-men films and the heart of the spiderman films-it emerges as just another superhero movie with nothing of its own to offer.Its not all bad though, for there are some moments of goodness amongst the superheroic blandness .Tim Storys eye for comedy ensures that there are plenty of laugh out loud moments like the things anti drug message to the kids , and a funny little montage of the fantastic fours day to day home life .In fact i found the humour and all of the jokes more enjoyable than the action sequences which were surprisingly disappointing!Also, with the exception of jesica albas wooden ,pathetic portrayal of sue storm and Julian macmahons lack of megalomaniac power in the role of Dr doom, the performances are pretty strong.Gruffud does well as a shy and retiring reed richard but its chiklis as the thing and evans as the human torch steal the show ! Chris evans has the cocky human torch down a tee and chiklis is brilliant as the self loathing tough guy turned stone.The little back and forths and bouts of bickering they have between each other are very good and overshadow the the sappy sue storm/ reed richard romance subplot.The film ends on a cliff hanger which promises that we are in for a treat with the inevitable sequel, but if its script had more depth and the action was more exciting then we would have been in for a treat the first time round.Oh and hardcore who don't agree can suck a fat one.That is all.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wasn't loving it.,"The choice between going to see this on the opening night or Madagascar, my original preferences would have gone to Madagascar, the trailers looking quite amusing. But going with a comic book fiend didn't really have that option. Having seen quite a lot of the comic book movies out lately, Daredevil, Elektra, X-men 1 and 2, Sin City, Spiderman 1 and 2, batman begins etc, i wasn't really sure what else this movie was going to have to offer in relation to new plot lines and exciting stories to tell, but i was quite interested to find out.Unfortunately i wasn't impressed. Admittedly they're based on predetermined characters so there's only so much you can indulge in them but the plot line was obvious, the villain was far from menacing, and how many different ways are there to show superhero's who just can't fit into normal everyday life.All the recent comic book-turn-movie hero's recently have been popped out one after the other so quickly, it's not giving anyone a chance in-between to think up new and original story lines before jumping on the comic bandwagon. Maybe it would have been more successful if the writers had spent a little more time on some depth and plot in the movie and had the release a few months or years after the hype from Batman Begins had died down in order to give it a fresh start where it could have been let off from the comparisons in some vague attempt at creating something original.Easy to watch, but it's probably worth waiting until it's shown on television because then you can do something worthwhile like ironing whilst watching it. Disappointed but occasional laughs.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great adaptation of a classic comic book,"There are some pretty awfully spawned adaptations of comic superheroes. Happily,this isn't one of them. A well crafted screenplay by Mark Frost and Michael France (who wrote the unfortunate Hulk) takes us through the characters transformation from ordinary hard working astrophysicists into superheroes. Ioan Gruffudd after coming to prominence in the Hornblower series, takes his first blockbuster leading role and does a sterling job (with obligatory mid Atlantic accent). But Julian McMahon ( another import- Aussie this time) steals the show as a sympathetic Victor Von Doom. Unlike the latest Harry Potter wizbangfest, you can watch this from alpha to omega without feeling something is missing. My only question is why oh why Jessica Alba as an uber scientist? I have the feeling it's her to blame for the initial radiation problem but can't prove it....",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Flop,"I grew up with Marvel comics. At the time, back in the sixties, they were seen as a fresh alternative to the stale old DC mags that were Superman's venue. Marvel burst on the scene with the FF, Spider Man and the X men using truly superior artwork and story lines that gathered a big following. Maybe the people responsible for this nonsensical dud thought they could capture the same sense of wonder, or maybe they thought they could just make a quick buck, but this execrable offering does very little justice to the original comic books. It was easy enough going in to see the target audience - young people who watch a boatload of TV, who expect a lot of noise and are attracted to super heroes. But I suspect even they soon got tired of a super hero saga done on the cheap. Much of what went wrong with this forgettable flick is the way it hints at things but then never delivers, and when it tried to make good on it's premise it invariably fell on it's face. Enough of these insults and I, for one, truly grew to dislike the people I was watching. Seeming like a hybrid of tawdry soap opera, Sentai cartoons and Plan Nine From Outer Space, Fantastic Four tries to distract you from what it really is - just another cheap comic book adaptation.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An excellent film that kept me on the edge of my seat!,"My husband and I went to see this today,and I was very happily surprised.I have really liked some of the superhero movies,and haven't liked some,but I really enjoyed this one.It has action,love interest,comedy,everything you could want.I was a big F4 fan as a kid,and I found out today that I still love them.Sue Storm has 2 terrific abilities,and Jessica Alba did her credit.Chris Evans had waaaay too much fun playing Johnny Storm.The others did as good a job as they did.It's so nice watching ""good guys"" enjoy being good(Johnny),and I really enjoyed the ""bad guy"" being bad!!

The best that it could be,This movie was a fairly good movie. This movie really couldn't be better than it was. Unless you changed a lot of the plot outline. When I saw the trailer for this movie I thought it was going to be terrible. But it was rather entertaining. If anyone made this movie and wanted to stay close plot. Their is no way of cutting out the cheesiness. The cheesiness is what made me give this 7 out of ten rating. When you see a movie like this you have to go in with an open mind. If you are in to comic books this is a good movie to see. Though I recommend Batman Begins more. Well this was much better than war of the worlds.This is a movie about five people who go up into space to study a storm. everything goes wrong and they slowly evolve into having special powers.I thought this movie was good but check it out for your self.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Far from ""Fantasic"", another lame attempt at a Hollywood comic blockbuster","1/2 Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, Julian McMahon. Directed by Tim StoryAnother Hollywood attempt to make every popular comic into a boring, overused CGI block buster, of course a miss. Along with the direction of usual comedic director Tim Story who seems to be out of his genre with this action film. Along with most of the actors/actresses who's charming personalities don't quite add up to the superhero they are to play (i.e Chiklis and Alba). The story of five astronauts who encounter a slight mis-hap on their space adventure when their DNA structure is reformed to give them superpowers, transforming them into the (Far from) Fantastic Four. Mr. Fantastic (Gruffudd), The Invisible Woman (Alba), Human Torch (Evans), and the Thing (Chiklis) who battle their arch nemesis Dr. Doom (McMahon; another reason he should stick to Nip/Tuck). The whole movie has about three scenes where the scene can be done with out tons of bad CGI and ILM. And of course giving the props to creator Stan Lee as Hulk, Spider-Man. The movie is far from ""Fantastic"" and leaves me guessing why Story for the director? My final rating 1/2/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Flawed, but better than I expected","When I saw the trailers for this film, I cringed. Reed Richards seemed more like a scientist that Jeff Goldbloom would play. Doom look kinda dumb, and then there's Jessica Alba. I really only went to see it because my friend wanted to see it for his birthday. Now I'm a big comic book fan so I know my Fantastic Four. I don't expect them to do everything just like the comic, but I like a certain continuity. I think the comic movies that fail are the ones that stray too far from the source material. You have almost fifty years of character development, why start from scratch again?This is where the Fantastic Four succeeds and fails. Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm are terrific. Both very true to their comic book counterparts and both scripted well in the film. They even got their rather competitive opposing nature down well. They rarely get along, but help each other when it counts.The conflict of the team itself is done well, too. The Fantastic Four is a team of strong, conflicting opinions. This was mirrored in the film. I almost always enjoyed their back and forth interaction.Now for the bad stuff.Reed Richards is just not Reed. This is forgivable in the film, and doesn't really cause any problems, but it just sort of aggravates me. Reed comes off like a bumbling loser, and worse, is constantly making mistakes. This is Reed Richards. The world's most brilliant man by leaps and bounds. I know that his mistake in the shielding caused the mutation of the Fantastic Four in the comic, and if that was Reed's only failing in the film, it would see realistic. Instead, he pretty much blunders through everything. He just doesn't seem very bright.The really unforgivable misstep, however, is Doctor Doom. Doom is a tyrant. A strong Leader. A feared man all over the planet. Well, not in this film. He's more of a chauvinistic yuppie. He is far too tame to be Doom, and comes across really as Lex Luthor. He really just seemed kinda bored by the whole ordeal. Doom is one of the greatest comic book villains of all time, and he came across as a second rate Spiderman villain.This is why you shouldn't stray to far from the tree when making comic book movies. Doom is a rich, interesting, complicated character. He has majesty and honor, villainy and cunning. The movies Doom just seems like he is going through the motions.Overall, I did enjoy watching this film. I would probably like to have the DVD, especially because it felt like there were scenes missing. I remember a few times when it seemed like the film kind of jumped awkwardly. Good effects, generally good story and acting, some flaws. It's worth your time, but don't expect perfection. I rank it in line with the first X-men movie. A good start. Let's hope for a better sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Fantastic 4"" delivers comic book action!!!","Few comic book action films live up to their billing but ""Fantastic 4"" provides great action sequences, CG & prosthetics, & better-than-average cinematography. A good cast in Ioan Gruffudd, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis(The Shield), Julian McMahon(Nip/Tuck), & the beautiful Jessica Alba. All of the actors mirror the Marvel Comic book heroes but McMahon's Dr. Von Doom, the story's villain. McMahon seemed a bit weak in his role due to a lack of enough ""evil"" displayed in his character. Michael Chiklis' Ben Grimm/The Thing steals the show with his soft-hearted & sensitive big man portrayal. Gruffudd is good as the studious & stretchy scientist Reed Richards, Chris Evans is excellent as impatient party monger Johnny Storm/Human Torch, & Jessica Alba fits well into her role as the brave & sexy Sue Storm/Invisible Woman.In ""Fantastic 4"", the three astronauts Richards, siblings Sue & Johnny, & Grimm along with mega rich sponsor Victor Von Doom trek into space with disastrous results. Bombarded by cosmic radiation, all five people are transformed into super heroes to their surprise. After medical testing upon returning to Earth, each member discovers their new gifts & realizes the good that could come of them. Richards gained the ability to stretch his body to unbelievable lengths, Johnny could ignite himself into a human torch & could fly, Sue could create force fields & turn invisible, & Ben Grimm gained incredible strength & is encased in impenetrable rock. While three of the astronauts adapted to their gifts, Grimm was saddened by his gifts because of the horror his wife would endure once she sees him.

Worst Marvel Production in the last years!,"Though I'm a real fan of marvel-comics and every time excited before a new movie enters the cinema, I'm really disappointed of this film. The Storyline is so weak (the story...what the hell?!)and distracting for a fan, the dialogs are awfully and the humor in the film is crap or falsely placed. What they make out of Doom is a scandal (grrr...yes, I'm really angry...)! The cast would have been OK, but what they made out of this movie is heartbreaking. And why this director for a serious marvel film? Yes, it's thought as this, or am I wrong?! It's thought as serious, but the result is in no compare to such fine productions like spiderman or the x-men. This film is good, if you are about ten years old and if you never have read any of the original comic-material! Sorry. Most of all for the other fans out there...",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

More than enough humor to go around, and plenty of action for even the toughest cynic. Also, excellent choice in sticking to a ""close to original"" costume for Dr. Doom. It was perfect. Although the end fight seen is admittedly short, the effects that bring it to life are positively breathtaking...Two thumbs way, way up...",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Probably as much as we could realistically hope for,"Firstly I don't understand some comments saying that it could have done with more action. These days it is the kiss of death to be just another CGI movie as there really is nothing new to see anymore.The characters were all pretty true to the comics apart from Reed Richards who, although dedicated to his work, was never a geek. Doom was also a bit weak (character wise) for me.Linking up Alicia Masters and the Thing was one of the worst bits - A blind babe hits it off with a big orange lumpy guy within 2 seconds of meeting him and then at the end he says he's fine staying as he is! He's either more blind than she is or else he's gay.One thing that I miss from the comics is the ludicrously huge 'mad scientist' laboratories of both Doom and Richards where a the average piece of equipment was the size of a small building and looked like it could blow up a planet or two.Overall I enjoyed it right up until the final battle with Doom which had no element of suspense whatsoever.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Oh the humanity!!!,"Absolutely the (THE) worst film adaptation of a comic-book (graphic novel) ever made. The only reason I even give it one star, is due to Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans, plus the special effects. Chiklis isn't the greatest actor, but he does that sort of role well. I hated Evans, but that was the point, he's playing a cocky a******. The rest of the acting was pathetic, by that I mean the leads. Gruffudd was the worst, but followed closely by Alba and McMahon. Really feel sorry for Chiklis, his work in *The Shield* is impeccable, and I say that as someone who doesn't really like that sort of show.Look, this is a comic book. They are always overly dramatic on the human interactions, but that is the appeal, simplistic human portrayals to mirror the larger than life characters. About all we got here were the stupid soap-opera interactions, slighting the larger characters. This was crap on a stick, the stick being our hopes for having some faithfulness to the genre.

Fantastic,"FANTASTIC FOUR Fox 2005 Color 91 minutes Action-Fantasy Jessica Alba, Iaon Gruffurd, Michael Chicklis, Chris Evans and Julian McMahon star. Directed by Tim Story Rated PG-13 for adult themes and violence So how fantastic is the new comic book flick Fantastic Four. Well I'm happy to say that it's pretty fantastic. Now don't get me wrong this film is by no means intelligent, ground breaking, creative or even semi original. But it doesn't pretend to be. it's nothing more than dumb fun and it's slightly refreshing to a see a film of such caliber. Director Tim Story of the highly enjoyable and under appreciated Taxi takes a hot cast of 5 and turns four of them into a superhero squad and one of them into a villain. thats basically the premise it's not much more except that they fight. And yes they actually really do fight. The spfx are pretty good and well used and the acting is acceptable for the film. Surprisingly Jessica Alba looks gorgeous and doesn't suck too bad. Ioan Gruffurd of King Arthur fame does a nice job of filling out his hunky suit. Making him the film's more mature looking and minded sexy guy. Michael Chicklis looks very cool and plays the part well as the Thing. Julian McMahon of Nip/Tuck turns in a sexy performance as Doom and the standout performance here is really mega sexy Chris Evans. whose undeniable comic appeal and likability makes him the films real star. Plus the fact if it was just him waling around near naked or in aform fitting suit the entire film that would along be the price of a movie ticket. God look at those abs and that ass.

Unoriginal,"The Fantastic Four is a typical comic book adventure, riding on the back of recent success in this genre. Although it is packed full of action, there is really little else to the film - and this certainly does not make the film memorable and/or unique. It certainly isn't original, and next to some of the other films of this genre, it adds very little.The ending is as familiar as any other film in this genre, with an expectation of more action yet to come. (So typical.) And the science behind the special powers is far from believable - I felt that other stories of this genre had better and more-thought-out scientific explanations.In short, this film fails to captivate in terms of originality and storyline. If you're a comic book fanatic, I'd recommend it, but don't expect much. If you're not, then there are much better films in this genre to see. If you're just looking for a little action, it may be worth it in between a slow-moving plot.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Its a popcorn flick!,"I wanna start by saying how it annoys me how people think they can be hyper critical of what is and always was gonna be a popcorn flick! Why do you feel that you have to complain about the directing, cinematography, lighting, hairdresser etc etc...A popcorn film is supposed to be fun not serious so take it more lightly.Anyway on to the film, i remember the cartoon series of this which, while extremely dated, was a good giggle and extremely tongue in cheek, i feel the film portrays this very well. My one complaint was Dr Doom and how the character was poorly developed, unlike the Fantastic Four, we barely seen the powers of Doom. The FX were really good and the scene on the bridge was awesome, even compared to the superior Spiderman and Batman, in which this amount of effects would not have been out of place. The critics panned the effects used for the thing but personally i am happy that it is a man in a suit as apposed to a CGI created blob.The film does take on the usual ""first in a franchise"" feel of character development over plot but i for one would happily watch a sequel if it plays out with as much fun as this. i wanted o give this film 7.5/10 but could only officially rate it 7/10 as opposed to round up to 8/10 as this is a popcorn flick not a ageless classic!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Very true to Marvel comics and lot of upside,"Whenever you see a movie which so many people hate or love so much, the truth is somewhere in between (usually). for this one, the hate mongers are pretty much in their own little world, and whatever they hate is too personal for them to describe, because this movie was extremely true to the comic book (for the most part), it was entertaining, action packed, and focused on the characters. Quite frankly, though I'm not an ardent fan, I can't find fault with this film. The comic book Fantastic Four focused on the characters even more than the powers. The genius Reed who can stretch his body as if there were no bones, but like the blob of the movies; the Invisible Woman, his wife Sue, the glue who keeps them together; and the rivalry between the superstrong grotesque Ben and the Hollywood fireball Johnny Storm. The movie doesn't deviate at all from these characters. Like the comic, it focuses on them. The comic book had several bad guys who fought them. And as in one famous comic quote, there is no law against trying to take over the world, and the Thing's famous response ""that wouldn't do much good against Galactus, though. He don't want to take over the world, he just wants to eat it."" Since Galactus was the most interesting of the villains, and Annihilus the second most, and then there were still the Frightful Four, the Mole Man, the Molecule Man, and others more powerful than Doom, a lot of people may have wanted them in the movie, but Doom was the personal enemy of Reed and his three friends. So the first movie would have to deal with Dr. Doom. And since the comic book was also famous for exposing the vast differences in character between the villains, one movie would not do justice to the comic. It will take several movies. For instance, while Doom was famous for being a psychopathic sort who mistreated those loyal to him, Annihilus would be rewarding for his yes men, and Galactus would merely place them where he thought best like an emotionless business syndicate. The Fantastic Four is about characters, and about mistakes, real live mistakes, heat of the moment decisions, and what they can cost us, and how Reed would realize his mistakes and try to learn from them. The movie covered that, and gave us the appeal of Grimm and Storm, whose antics made the comic even greater. This movie falls into place. In time, it may depend upon the sequels to give it a higher rating.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Rotten, but enjoyable, if only for unintentional humour","I hate to say this about any superhero film, but here it is: This movie's a bad movie. The plot is sedentary and has only two real action scenes, neither of which are well-handled or much fun. The characters are strictly one-note:Reed Richards: Science dork, bad at flirting Sue Storm: In love with Reed, a lot (her most defining character moment comes when, still trying to cope with invisibility, she ends up standing in a crowd in nothing but her underwear) Johnny Storm: Hormone-addled teen Ben Grimm: Struggling to cope with his transformation.The plot is stolen wholesale from Spider-Man 1. Johnny Storm spends the entire movie torturing the movie's most sympathetic, human character, Ben Grimm, and never gets the custard pie in the face he so richly deserves. The characters' backstories are alluded to over and over, but don't try and figure any of it out, because it just doesn't work (Reed's bankrupt...and he can still live in a skyscraper, employ devoted servants, and build fancy machines?).All this said, bear in mind that if you're looking for a quick superhero fix, you could do worse than F4. The characters (with the exception of Johnny Storm) are likable, the plot is simple and satisfying, and there are a few laughs and thrills.(Warning--the movie's rated PG, but there's some dirty humour and a female character undresses a lot.)",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One word can describe this movie: Fantastic.,"Where to start...I guess I'll start by saying that Fantastic Four is a fun, enjoyable movie. By no means is it a masterpiece film, but I love it, though being a big fan of the comics, and looking forward to the film for a while may influence that).STORY The story in the Fantastic Four is nearly the same as in the comics, with the addition of Doom on the space-ship, and his reactions to the cosmic storm hitting the ship. The story is obviously not realistic, which isn't the point of the movie, because having someone turn into a rock or go invisible isn't realistic. For a comic book movie, I really like the story. It's not really cheesy or corny, but but kind of campy, which is the Fantastic Four I know and love. 8/10CASTING In my opinion, the casting is nearly perfect. No cast will ever be perfect, because everyone has their opinions, but I feel this cast was excellent. Some I wouldn't have chosen, but they played their part like they were supposed to. 10/10ACTING The acting was not superb, but it was good. Evans and Chiklis do the best jobs in the movie in my opinion. I also think Gruffudd and Alba did good jobs as well, not to mention McMahon's Doom, who was pretty solid as well. 8/10 SFX These effects were believable, stunning, just fantastic. 10/10 for the effects.EVERYTHING ELSE There were only a few things I didn't like about the movie, which was some of the dialogue. (What happens when you super-heat rubber?) Outside of that, I found the movie enjoyable, fun, and very true to the comics, outside of Doom, who surprisingly was superior in the film. I like all the little references and similarities to things in the comics.OVERALL I give this movie a solid 9/10. My 2nd favorite movie of 2005, behind Batman Begins, and just ahead of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.Don't listen to the critics, go see the movie for yourself. You'll hate it or love it, but you should still have a fun time. I recommend this movie to people all of ages, as I think all ages will enjoy it if you're not expecting a masterpiece. Oh, and before I forget, I'm not a studio plant, as many people on the boards suggest.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The last time I checked, good acting was a plus........","I'd like to start off on a positive note - but no matter how much I would like to - I simply cannot.

I could bash the directing(or lack thereof). I could rip apart the atrocious acting. I could punch holes in the see-through plot. I could even make fun of the soundtrack, but I'm not going to. Instead, I'm going to take the high road and complain about the overall lack of breasts in this particular film (The ONE thing i believe could have saved this flop). As a rule, superhero movies have never been all that great. (except for Spiderman, of course.) But this one takes the cake.

They are much better and at least you won't be forced to listen to Sum 41.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Acceptable, but not Memorable","Well, I broke down and saw the Fantastic Four the other day. Now I'll begin by saying that I am a fan of the comics. I work in a comic shop, I regularly receive ""Marvel Knights 4"" (A fantastic four book) as well as ""Ultimate Fantasitc Four"" (another F4 title). But as a movie goer, I know that I need to keep an open mind when going to see films. Especially films adapted from pre-existing media. So My fiancée and I broke down and went to the theater.So, all in all I must say there were aspects I was quite glad they touched on and others that I was a bit disappointed about.The story basically touches on the Fantastic Four's roots. Fleshing out the character development that made Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic)< Sue Storm (Invisible Woman), Ben Grimm (The Thing), and Johnny Storm (The Human Torch II) into super heroes. It also shows the emergence of their rogues gallery beginning with Victor VonDoom, who becomes (you guessed it) Dr. Doom. It deals with the science experiment gone awry, the rising popularity of the 4, the downfall of VonDoom and the eventual Final Battle.I won't ruin the end but I have to say, comparable to battle scenes in the Comic, this one was spot on (albeit short). If anything the movie really touches on the human aspect and problem solving that usually fills the pages of the Fantastic Four Comics. Not all comics are for kids, much less nothing but nonstop actions. They are mediums to tell stories, and usually F4 deals with the issues of Reed and His Gang and how they overcome popularity, bankruptcy, global terrors, etc. The movie captured this aspect perfectly, but the storyline itself is questionable.As most movies like this do, it tries to squeeze all the best an most popular stories it can into one film. Usually acquired at the expense of comic continuity. And whereas many of us comic fans can say that certain story aspects are out of order, we have to realize that no movie can be completely true to the books all in one sitting. It is nearly impossible for a movie to take another media's concept that has had a history such as F4's and put it into a 3 hour film. it's not do-able. It is the same problem that the movie ""Watchmen"" will be faced with: How can you make a 400 Page Graphic novel into a 3 hour film, and still do the original story justice? It can't really be done. So whereas I do give some ""props"" to the way the story for F4 was handled, I also have the comic geek inside of me saying ""NO NO NO! That's not supposed to happen until much later!"" In any case, the movie does a fine job of rendering the story as believable, and many fans will recognize many aspect of the Four's plight.Casting wise, I was never too keen on casting Michael Chiklis as the thing. I personally thought he should've been played by Brad Garrett (of Everybody Loves Raymond). He had the size and most definitely the voice that would've been perfect. Plus the fact that the Thing is small in the film and is lacking in his huge eyebrows truly put me off. But after seeing the movie my little nitpickiness became a moot point. Chiklis wasn't at all disappointing and the rest of the cast seemed to do just as well. I know we've all had reservations about Jessica Alba (especially when Naomi Watts would'dve been a lot better) and actors Like Iaon Guffard and Chris Evans who are relatively Unknown. But let's keep in mind everyone has to get their break somewhere and just because unknown names signed on to a product that garners millions of comic fans, we shouldn't hold it against them. The only person in the cast that truly disappointed me was the portrayal of Dr. Doom. by Julian McMahon. Dr.Doom has always been portrayed as a mad doctor, and on top of that a very angry one at that. The voice, I feel, was not creepy and evil enough. It should've been closer to Darth Vader, rather than just regular old Julian McMahon. It took me out of the moment, and was a very unfortunate choice.Overall, I'll give the movie a 7 out of 10. Not just for effort, but also for the fact that that it was miles away from the Corman film of the same name. Jeez, have you seen that ""movie""? Wow. Anyway, the film is well put together. The casting is odd but by far not abominable as many people on the Message Boards have stated. And as for the comic fans, don't bash it because you feel it's your job. Try it, you might like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Hollywood 101,"From this you can perfectly observe how Hollywood works. First, we have the screen writing from Mark Frost, best known from the mystery Twin Peaks. So, we have various elements from the writers' handbook that are now familiar: References to God-like figures, a mystery (blind) character called Alicia, a fantasy character called Grimm. I guess the four characters were initially taken from the four elements. Michael France wrote GoldenEye and Hulk, which earned him a co-writer ship here. So we get the nasty boss and dictator (who turns literally into steel) and the Hulk-figure. The director Tim Story, from Taxi, comes along and adds Taxi-humor to this. Everything is mixed and we have a movie that's incoherent but slightly entertaining.Comic books are usually one-dimensional. In order to translate this to the big screen movies have to add some dimension: X-Men added drama, Sin City used the comic book container to do film noir and this only tries to throw in fun. The science mentioned in Fantastic Four is completely ludicrous except for some basic facts, but that fits the angle.We have Chris Evans as the new Tom Cruise, and Jessica Alba from Sin City again in a comic book adaptation.Critics hate this because it is no cinema. They see hundreds of movies and know this does not stand out. The larger public only sees a few movies per month and is mostly entertained by this. So this makes money while getting panned.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not a bad movie...,"It's definitely not up to par with the other good Marvel movies - Spiderman and X-Men - but is certainly an underrated movie like Daredevil was. This movie had it's dumb moments but overall it was enjoyable. I liked Thing and Torch the most but Invisible girl was pleasant (of course it being Jessica Alba doesn't hurt). With the previews that it received I stayed away from it for a long time, I never had the burning desire to see it, if you'll pardon the pun. Having stayed away for so long I wished now I would've seen it earlier - I've wasted several hours of my life on bad movies, usually with the phrase ""That's two hours of my life I won't get back."" uttered shortly thereafter... The fight scene between the Thing and Mr. Fantastic was hilarious and well done. I liked this movie and was entertained by it - I wished it was a little longer and I hope there's a second and third one sometime soon.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Steaming pile,"Pros: None come to mindCons: Out of all the comic-book/video-game driven movies of the past few years this is by far one of the absolute WORST! I mean this thing is on par with Batman and Robin, which as we all know set the bar pretty low for bad movies. Besides the fact that the plot is completely inane, not a single one of the actors could make his/her character even slightly believable. Now this is probably due to the paper-thin source material; but many of the scenes felt almost awkward, as if the actors themselves didn't even want to be spouting this drivel. I realize that comic book plots are not supposed to be realistic, and I accept that. But this movie fails on every level not just plot (dialog, character development, basic acting skill, walking and chewing gum at the same time...) Even if you have a sick fetish for Alba, that does not justify seeing this movie. And let's not forget the biggest tragedy of all: Fantastic Four 2.Other Thoughts: Avoid this movie at all costs. If you're at a party and someone even suggests it, just walk out. You'll thank me later, you don't need those kind of friends.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"if you must see it, you should probably not pay for it","This is arguably the worst film I have ever seen. To read that some members of our society actually believe that this is a great movie is an insult to the intelligence of the human race in general. This film is so flawed that I desperately wanted those two hours of my life back. I would complain about the $8.50, but I saw it for free. The characters are very plainly played by a very detached cast who seem to spend the whole movie just trying to establish their characters. Keep in mind these are the most simplistic of characters and could be fully explained in 5 minutes. Jessica Alba gets the award for dumbest scientist with her downright hilarious line ""That blast must have fundamentally altered our DNA."" I actually laughed out loud at the look of ""I have no idea what I just said"" on her face. These supposed ""scientists"" are so unphased by their transformations, that it quickly becomes one of the most comically unconvincing stories of all time. There are also plenty of just plain stupid ideas. One of my personal favorites was the testing of the human torch's ability to light himself on fire. When he decides to see how ""hot he can go,"" Alba's character states that he was ""approaching the temperature of the sun!"" I don't care what material that metal box he was in was made of, or how thick it was. If that guy was approaching the temperature of the sun, everybody and everything on the planet should be dead. Overall, this is easily the worst superhero movie to be released and also one of the worst films of all time. Cheesy scripting, bad acting, terrible plot, and B-rated special effects make this one almost unbearable.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprising adaptation,"This movie chronicles the creation of the Fantastic Four team and their nemesis Dr. Doom, from the moment of their employment to the first victory over Dr. Doom. As a comic book adaptation this movie succeeds where others have failed (X-men and Spawn to mention a few), this is quite true to the material and don't overreach itself like X-Men (which introduces too many characters) or tries to be an action flick entirely like Superman 2.The story is good and well executed (not like Hulk where it becomes meaningless running around). The effects are good, the Thing does look a bit too stony (my picture of him was a little more organic)but it dosn't change the overall impression. The acting is also good, with Michael Chiklismaking the best performance as Ben Grimm/The Thing, he portrays the confusion and distress of Ben perfectly. Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom is also good but this role isn't far from his role in Charmed.All in all this is a good adaptation and hopefully the sequel will also be, a 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four,"There's nothing overly wrong with this film, it's a good effort, but it just didn't work for me.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Neither fantastic nor appalling,"Tricky thing, adapting comic-books: you can get a masterpiece like Spider-Man 2 or Batman Begins, but also a load of rubbish like Batman & Robin. Fantastic Four, based on Marvel's oldest creation, falls somewhere in between: it lacks that special something that made Sam Raimi and Chris Nolan's work unmissable, but has enough good material to elevate it above the utter silliness of Joel Schumacher's Bat-flick.Given the source comic is the most kid-friendly of the Marvel stable, director Tim Story wisely keeps the plot simple: five people doing research in space find themselves exposed to cosmic rays and almost die. Once back on Earth, they discover the radiations altered their DNA, giving them superhuman abilities: Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) can stretch any part of his body as if it were rubber; Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) can become invisible and generate force fields; her brother Johnny (Chris Evans) is able to turn himself into a living flame, hence his superhero name Human Torch; Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Reed's best friend, has had his skin replaced with an exoskeleton made of rock, meaning he has superhuman strength and is substantially invulnerable. Unfortunately, he is also the only one of the four who can't ""turn off"" his power, a discovery that makes him very angry and resentful. This prompts Reed to look for a cure with Susan's help, whereas Johnny just wants to have fun. Soon enough, though, they will have to join forces against the fifth member of the space trip, Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon), whose lust for absolute power is making him do increasingly monstrous things.Well, not so monstrous, perhaps: the PG-rating keeps the violence on a very harmless level, making the movie very similar to the comics in terms of tone, although that doesn't mean the action looks less spectacular than usual. What is less accomplished than usual, on the other hand, is the writing and character development: that the movie spends a lot of time explaining things is expected, almost acceptable actually, as this will make the possible sequel free to plunge straight into the action; even so, however, the writers must think most viewers have a flawed attention span, as they have Reed or Susan repeat the same thing (""The space storm radically altered the structure of our DNA..."" and related gibberish) at least five times in a fifteen-minute time-frame.Another problem is the leading roles: Gruffudd and Alba do their best, but even that isn't much when their characters are given few relevant things to do or say and the relationship between them is essentially based on embarrassed looks and cheesy dialogue. The whole thing is made more surprising by the fact that one of the film's writers is Mark Frost, who managed to craft intelligent story lines on Twin Peaks but seems incapable of handling a simple romance in this case.The last significant defect is the villain: a respectable presence on paper, Dr. Doom is robbed of any charm on screen, partly because the script makes him little more than a Green Goblin clone (case in point: the scene where he offs several business partners is taken almost shot for shot from the first Spider-Man), partly because McMahon ends up playing him that way, failing to give the character that original mix of suaveness and amorality he effortlessly masters on Nip/Tuck.Thankfully, the two people comic-readers love the most happen to be the best thing in the movie as well: the Thing doesn't only look very realistic (the reason being a suit was used instead of CGI), he's also got a solid story arc, ably supported by Chiklis, one of the American small screen's recent revelations (The Shield), while Evans nails the Torch's wisecracking, energetic personality with an ease that is missing in Gruffudd and Alba's performances. Whenever those two are on screen, pulling pranks on each other or delivering their instantly recognizable catchphrases (Ben Grimm's ""It's clobberin' time!"" being particularly delightful to hear), the picture gets back on track, albeit only for a few minutes.Overall, not incredibly bad but not that memorable either. Here's hoping the next installment will have more speaking in its favor.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"No ""Batman Begins""... but mostly solid stuff","Well, I just returned from watching ""Fantastic Four""... and I think the mixed reviews it's been getting are pretty justified. For those of you who aren't aware, ""Four"" is about four (duh) friends whose genetic material is changed by a radioactive cloud on a trip to outer space, and their subsequent evolution into the well-known superhero team. Sounds like a fairly interesting story, right? It would be, but ""Fantastic Four"" falls short in the one area that gave ""Spiderman"" and ""Batman Begins"" such high praise-- character depth. Unlike many reviewers, I don't think the problem lies with the actors; the script was terrible. The screenwriter's one-liners and dumb jokes seem more fitting for a bland teen movie, and there is hardly any room for growth.In fact, the acting is fairly good. Chris Evans (as Johnny Storm) is probably the funniest part of the movie; all of the good dialogue went to him, and his antics are, for the most part, in line with what I think the comic's creators had in mind. Michael Chiklis (as Ben Grimm) deserves a lot of praise not only for getting into that Thing suit every day, but for giving the gentle giant a depth that none of the other characters reaches. Ioan Gruffudd's Reed Richards is appropriately stiff, painfully geeky, and as a result isn't very likable, but he's a fine young actor, and I give him props for remaining true to the character. Jessica Alba's interpretation of Sue Storm was less than satisfying; however, her lines were by far the worst. Julian McMahon played a pretty flat, one-sided Victor Von Doom, but with a self-explanatory name like that, the creators were already condemning him to the one-sided evil villain subgroup.Otherwise, if you're looking for something entertaining to watch on a hot summer's day (or want a good smash-em-up superhero film to take the kids to that isn't as dark as the newest ""Batman"" installment), ""Fantastic Four"" delivers. If you're looking for an interesting movie that will make you think, I'd advise you to look elsewhere.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fantastic four does not. i think the critics were right the way they criticized this movie. it was just very annoying watching it. i just couldn't wait until it was over. its not that i didn't like the comics, they were fine, but this was just a bad interpretation of it. i guess after 20 years of great super hero movies, its hard to come close to them. still, the acting was terrible and the plot was terrible. don't go to see it. i recommend any of the spider man movies or the first batman movie with jack Nicholson as the Joker. those are quality super hero movies.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Not the worst superhero movie I've seen, but I liked Roger Corman's better...","""Fantastic Four"" isn't a terrible superhero film, but it isn't anything to write home about either. It's got a light plot that's suitable for younger audiences, with a lot of comedy hijinks and some likable characters. The film suffers from a villain that isn't developed enough and Jessica Alba as ""Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman"" is very badly cast: by choosing such an attractive woman, the movie constantly looks for excuses for her to strip down and take off her clothes so that she can become truly invisible (since her clothes cannot become transparent like her) and it feels like a pointless reminder that she is in fact, a beautiful actress. It gets tiresome very quickly and feels like eye candy thrown in for teenage boys, when no other elements of the plot seem to be aiming for an older audience. Overall the special effects and costumes are good, it's just a shame the story couldn't have been tighter. (On DVD, July 20, 2012)",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Finally, a human sci-fi movie that delivers on the comic books' tone and feel.","When this movie ended, the full house actually broke into spontaneous applause, which I hadn't witnessed at a movie since E.T. The Fantastic Four is just pure, unadulterated fun, with a simple story, an interesting human conflict, four interesting characters, and delightful actors strutting their fine stuff. There are jokes that make you laugh without straining, underdogs you WANT to root for, and a very well-acted bad guy (Julian Mahon). All the characters are interesting, believable, fun, witty, and not too dark. There is NO embarrassingly trite and out-of-context sub-plot, such as the RIDICULOUS ninja characters in Batman Begins. Fantastic Four is just a simple, witty tale of 4 ordinary people who are trying to deal with the curse or gift of superpowers. It's a true beginning to what I hope is several more episodes.Director Tim Story really succeeded in delivering a fresh, witty tale of a family that is both ordinary and super-ordinary, that we can all identify with, yet which represents the best in all of us. It's the kind of tale that Steven Spielberg would have produced.The audience contained viewers of all ages: Kids from 8 to 80. There were comic book freaks wearing Fantastic Four T-shirts and beards, moms with their kids, teen-agers, and a smattering of adults for this afternoon movie on opening day. People loved the movie, and I guess they responded like me: I feel jaded by watching the overblown 'special effects' of computer-generated armies of millions (a la the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, where it's obvious that nothing is real). I'm equally tired of movies like Batman, where the tone and atmosphere is so dark or distorted that you can't tell what is happening or where it takes place.I think the reason most people are staying away from movies this summer is because they are tired of un-believable characters and of movies that hide their lack of a good plot line with increasingly silly and extravagant special effects, gratuitous violence and sex. What we want is a good story, good acting, and believable people told in a fresh and witty way. Fantastic Four shows what a great movie should be about. It's not a Game Boy extravaganza. It's a diverting, interesting tale with five really interesting actors having a lot of fun. Everyone and their kids can see it and enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Pretty Fantastic Four,"As a kid, years ago, I remember being a fan of ""The Fantastic Four"" comic and the cartoon series. Predictably, I had an affinity for Reed Richards, the cool scientist guy. So for years I had been curious regarding the comic's translation to the big screen. ""The Fantastic Four"" had been swirling in the motion picture winds longer than other Marvel Superheroes including X-Men and Spider-Man. Director Tim Story's retelling of the comic in his movie, ""Fantastic Four"", rekindles fond memories, and updates the tale with a playful feel and edge. In a departure from previous Superhero movies like X-Men and Spider-Man, ""Fantastic Four"" is not high drama, nor an exploration into the nature of hero. ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-Man"" are superior movies. This is Superhero lite. This is not a bad thing, only different. Really. Much like one of it's characters, Johnny Storm (The Human Torch), it's all X-Games edge. These are the Gen-X Superheroes. It's all about the rush. Writers Michael France and Mark Frost deliver the difficult Act I narrative of the origins of the Fantastic Four. The story is frenetic, although weak on character development. This pitfall is overcome mostly, by excellent casting. Ioan Gruffdd has the right ""dork"" touch for brilliant scientist Reed Richards. Jessica Alba, though seemingly too young for the role of Sue Storm, is strong and sensible. Chris Evans steals the movie as Extreme Sports Astronaut washout, Johnny Storm. Michael Chiklis elicits pathos as Ben Grimm, who becomes embodied in the rock of the Thing. Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom is very cool evil.Richards and company along with Von Doom, embark on a venture to study the affects of a Radiation Storm passing Earth aboard Von Doom's space station. Due to Reed's miscalculation, the crew is caught unprepared for the storm's early arrival. All five members are exposed to the severe radiation; thus, altering their DNA. My bud Ron, reminded me that Doom in the comics had a different fate. However, this revision actually is more compelling. Back on Earth, Reed, Sue, Johnny, Ben, and Victor develop astonishing powers. Victor takes a decidedly dark turn. Reed's body has amazing stretching ability. Sue can become invisible and project force fields. Johnny can ignite into flames at will. Ben becomes a rock-like monster with incredible strength. Victor transforms into a metal creature able to harness and disperse great energy. So the Fantastic Four must battle the now powerful Dr. Doom (Victor).In another extreme culture departure as illustrated by Johnny Storm, he embraces his Superhero status like that of being a rock star. It is not a curse. Reed asks Johnny whether there is any higher pursuit than making a lot of money and meeting girls. Johnny says, ""No."" Props for Johnny. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm has the right elements of bravado, and playfulness. That can also be said for rest of the movie. Ioan Gruffud has the canny stiffness that is appropriate for Reed Richards, providing a contrast. Jessica Alba is believable as Sue. She is also very hot. She is even naked in the movie, unfortunately her character is invisible. Michael Chiklis is very sympathetic as the tortured Thing. Julian McMahon revels as the evil Victor Von Doom.""The Fantastic Four"" is great summer entertainment. There will be sequel. Perhaps, FF2 retains it's extreme sports sensibilities, and focuses a little more on character.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The clue to this films in the name.... Fantastic,"I'm not really a major marvel fan, i've read a few comics, had a few toys, still got some in-fact. Yet i never really looked at comic's coming to the big screen in a way that they have. Normally in cheesy films were everything is over done (like the old batman films). Yet when Spiderman was released, i was amazed. I was shocked at how something that was on paper could be brought to life in such a way that people could almost associate themselves with the characters.Just before the release of this film, i decided to read some previews on it. I like to do this for most films, because if critic's say its ""crap"" then most the time the film is actually really good (not to say u have bad judgement.... but u do). So after hearing that this film was supposed to be one of the biggest flops of the year. I thought, thats a really bad preview, a really bad one considering no one's actually seen it yet. So i thought, seeing as my philosophy about preview's has never let me down (pluss the trailers looked really amazing) this film is probably going to be really amazing. And i was right.Even if you don't no the story plot of the comic series, don't worry, the film's plot (although slightly different) will intrigue and amaze you so much, you'll need a hole bunch of medic's on standby, just in-case u have a heart attack..Ioan Gruffudd (Reed Richards), normally referred to as Lancelot or if you ever watch the series, Horn-blower. This role as head of the fantastic four, required a more, adult type role of the 4. Always thinking before acting, and by god does he pull this off.Jessica Alba (Sue Storm... invisible girl), normally seen wearing nothing but tight pants and a bra....no not clicked yet? She played Nancy in sin city. This woman is stunning, funny and smart (add cooking and cleaning, and she'd be perfect... only kidding). Equally on par with everyone else in the film, her role as the invisible girl is not for the feint of heart. Specially when she cant control her powers and is standing in her underwear.... bet your all looking forward to that shot.Chris Evans...(torch, human flame, human torch) Don't recognise him? Come on, normally on a phone saving peoples lives? Celluar star Chris Evans produces one of the most amazing performances i've seen. Not only funny but also witty and sarcastic... He presents himself as every teenagers dream, living the life of stardom, as well as being able to incinerate to a whooping 4000 degrees. Yet, its not the character that make the torch they way he is, its Chris. Adding his own fun personality into this role, makes him shine as probably the ""coolest"" one out of the four.Micheal Chiklis...(Ben Grimm, ""The thing"") who? I've never heard of this guy, or seen him in any well known movie. A risky choice maybe, a bad one? I don't think so. Micheal's performance is magical. He manages to pull of the huge brute fantastically. Not only with the physical side (punch people half way across the world) but also with his own mental battle. Micheal actually makes you feel for the guy, which in an action packed movie like this, is a very rare and hard thing to do.Julian McMahon....(Dr Victor Van Doom) Well, i don't really think you'll see a better actor play the hardest bad guy anywhere, ever. Julians was unbelievable... portrayed as the doctor that cuts people insides up, is now going to be seen as probably the best villain (other than Dath Vader) of all time. He was evil, cruel, menacing, and damn right out of this world. He brought to the screen a feeling of wanting, people will sit there thinking, i really want to be that guy. Not just because of his huge unbelievable powers, but because he's a normal, money and power hungry man (like most of us). He embraces his power, and by god does it show.Now for the part I'm sure you've all been waiting for, visual effects. Most of you will think nothing can be different, it will be the same as every other visual effect film. How wrong you are. You will walk out that cinema with your hair on fire it looks that real. Every visual effect is brilliantly carried out, turning invisible in a split second is really cool stuff. The visual effects make is seem like an normal random person and just do it. Same with everything else. Yet by far the best above all has to be the human torch. Covering his whole body in fire (i don't see that being a suit... do you?). He looks unreal, the flames so life like, as if someone could actually burst into the flames in the chair next to you. Its just, well, indescribable... you've got to see it to be believe it. There is only one problem with one of the characters CGI. Thats good old Reed Richards. Although most of the time, basically perfect animation texture and colouring. At one point in the film, his arm did look complete fake.... but hey, graphic's aren't that good yet, so you cant have everything.Overall, this film easily stands out amongst the masses of films. I personally think its one of the best films i've seen since Lord of the Rings. Inviting, not particularly taxing to watch, funny and the bad guy is just amazing. Once you've seen this film, you'll be wanting more, you'll want those toys, them models, t-shirts and mugs. Some of you may even take it as far as a Dr Doom costume.... It is that surreal.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
