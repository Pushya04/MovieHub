a mainstream comedy that actually works,"Kevin Klaven (Paul Rudd) hasn't a friend in the world - or so he realizes when he becomes engaged to Zooey (Rashida Jones) and finds he can't come up with a single male buddy to be in his wedding party. The solution? Go out and make some platonic guy friends, even if it means having to rely on your mommy (Jane Curtin) and your gay younger brother (Andy Samberg) to help you do it. Eventually, after a number of faltering attempts, Kevin alights on Sydney (Jason Segel), a mucho macho bundle of testosterone who, like a latter-day Henry Higgins to Kevin's Eliza Doolittle, instructs the awkward lad on the fine art of ""being a man."" But as with any good teacher/pupil relationship, each side winds up learning a little something from the other before it's all over.A straight man far more comfortable in the company of women than of men, Kevin emerges as the ultimate metrosexual figure: fastidious in demeanor, sensitive to the needs of others, and courteous to a fault (he even admits to liking ""The Devil Wears Prada"" in a moment of unguarded weakness). He doesn't really know how to roughhouse it with the boys, and any efforts he makes in that direction inevitably lead to failure. Until our man Sydney steps into the breach to give him a few badly needed pointers, that is.Smoothly directed by John Hamburg, ""I Love You, Man"" is a relaxed, breezy and sharply written male-bonding comedy that - miracle of miracles - doesn't play down to its audience (it may be crude at times, but it's rarely childish). The Hamburg/Larry Levin screenplay does a clever job poking fun at the double entendres inherent in any modern-day bromance, though one wishes certain characters - Kevin's family members, in particular - had been allotted a little more in the way of screen time. That being said, the performances are all first-rate, with Rudd and Segel playing to their respective strengths - Rudd's of the tongue-tied, self-effacing Mr. Nice Guy who needs lessons in ""manning up,"" and Segel's of the refreshingly blunt but socially indelicate Man/Child who clearly needs to do some growing up.There's additional excellent work from J.K. Simmons, Jamie Pressly, Sarah Burns and Rob Huebel, among others.It's also a bit of a casting coup to get both Jane Curtin from the first generation of SNL players and Andy Samberg from the current one together in the same film. Finally, some unlikely cameo appearances by Lou Ferrigno and the band Rush, all appearing as themselves, add to the spirit of fun that permeates the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"the plot isn't what works- it's all about actors, timing, awkward pauses, realistic dialog","I Love You, Man may feel like another Apatow company production, but it's mostly because some of its ""stock"" company players (I put quotes as it's both a loose term and just about right) like Paul Rudd and Jason Siegel. They give the air of using the screenplay as the easiest of diving boards into just shooting-the-hell-of-it with one another as two friends. Rudd plays a guy about to get married and is embarrassed to find out, from all those around him more than anything, that he doesn't have many, or really any, true friends. He meets Siegel at an open house for Lou Ferrigno (he's a real estate agent and Ferrigno fills the oddball cameo choice, it's a great choice though), and the two hit it off as a ""bromance"" develops.It's this ""bromance"" that makes I Love You, Man a little interesting as a double-edged romantic comedy. It's already about Rudd and his to-be played by Rashida Jones, their little moments of fun and their arguments too (there's a cute running gag involving Rudd's imitations of the band Rush sounding like an Irishman), but then it's also got plenty of innuendo to this being really about the guys, how Siegel gets attached to Rudd in that way that surely isn't gay but is more than just casual acquaintance stuff (see his ""investment"" plan unfold). But truth be told it's not even this that makes I Love You, Man so funny.Rudd and Siegel are simply funny guys, but naturally so; there's a new trend to put a somewhat straight face on gross out gags in these movies, Apatow or its spin-off groups (one can equate it to the good rip-offs of Tarantino in the 90s to a certain extent), and it works very well here. It's like a sweet blending of Curb Your Enthusiasm awkwardness (if, of course, nowhere near the genius of that, especially with story) and some of the low-brow Adam Sandler stuff and joyfully useless banter and non-jock male bonding. It's not any better or lessor than recent stuff from Siegel and Rudd; you could watch this with either Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Role Models and be satisfied about the same. Again, plot is not at all the strong suit, but if you just want some cleverly obvious comedy dialog it's a good detour.At the least, we get one of the funniest lines of the year, or just in years, near the very end: ""I love you... Broseph Goebbels!""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Somewhere between awkward and hilarious or is it both?,"Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) is a real estate agent, and his girlfriend Zooey Rice (Rashida Jones) just accepted his marriage proposal. Everything is looking great, but then she along with her friends start to notice that he has no male friends. He goes on a search for a best friend and encounters Sydney Fife (Jason Segel) at one of his open house.It's a little awkward at the start before Jason Segel. It has some funny moments especially with Thomas Lennon and throwing up on Jon Favreau. But Paul Rudd solo desperately needs a wing man. That's what the movie is about. But the comedy is hit and miss without it. Rudd and Segal have good chemistry. Mostly it works well. There are some good funny jokes in this.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny movies have to be funny.  That's the only rule.,"Funny movies have to be funny. That's the only rule about funny movies. They don't have to live up to any expectations, they can be about the same thing that movies always are. It really doesn't matter. As long as they are funny.I Love You, Man is a funny movie. In case the plot is of any interest to you, it's about this guy (Paul Rudd) who is getting married to this woman (Rashida Jones), but he realizes that he doesn't really have any male friends to fill out his side of the wedding party. So he starts on a quest with the aid of his brother (Andy Samberg) to find a best man. When he finally thinks he finds one (Jason Segel), hilarity ensues.On the spectrum of comedies, this is a bro movie. One made basically for guys, a little raunchy. But honestly, it's not too R-rated. It cusses a bit, discusses sex a lot, things like that. But not nearly as R-rated as say... Role Models, which I feel is sort of along the same lines. Comparable at least. They are both very funny movies, and both have Paul Rudd.But this is about I Love You, Man. The highlight of the movie, for me, is Thomas Lennon as Doug. I have been a fan of his for a long time, at least since Reno 911 came out. Which is a brilliant show. Paul Rudd is very, very cute, but not always convincing, the same with Rashida Jones as his fiancée. It's a movie that Ben Stiller would have made if he were younger. Jason Segel does what Jason Segel does. He plays his role very capably as Sydney, the crazed friend.And that is I Love You, Man. It's a rather simple, but funny movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jason Segal and Paul Rudd are a perfect match,"I normally wouldn't review a movie that wasn't just released on DVD or still in theaters, but I honestly couldn't believe there were negative reviews of this movie! How can you not like it!? In my opinion the only people who probably won't like this movie are those who are offended by cussing and sex talk (there's a lot. Less than ""The Hangover"" but more than ""Something about Mary"") or those who read WAAAAAY too much into things. I mean, TV and movies are not meant to be your moral compass in life. It's supposed to be funny and slightly over-the-top...it's a comedy, not a documentary.Someone was complaining that it makes men look bad? Come on. You can't be serious. I think that Peters character is a little shy in the beginning (which A LOT of men are) but Sidney brings him out of his shell and shows him how fun life can be if you let loose once in a while. Once he and Sidney meet, he really starts enjoying himself. He's kicking a** at fencing, he's ""slappin da base"" again, etc. It's a definite bro movie but it's also a couples movie. I know some women who find it offensive...like my mom (which I still think is ridiculous), but I honestly can't imagine a man being so overly sensitive that they think it's anti-men. If anything, it's PRO-men. It's showing how guys need time with their friends, not just sitting at home with their girlfriends every night.Bottom line, it's quite possibly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I can watch it 100 times (and probably have lol) and it still makes me (and my husband) LMAO at the same jokes every.single.time. To me, that is how I know if something is REALLY funny. I will say that I didn't laugh very much the first time I watched it. I honestly don't know why (maybe I was in a bad mood), but the second time I watched it I had to keep pausing it so I could laugh and it's been like that ever since.Paul Rudd and Jason Segal together are a match made in heaven. All of the ""klavinisms"" are beyond awkward and beyond funny. They are things that come into my head when someone says a certain word in a conversation and I just bust out laughing b/c I'm thinking of this movie. and Sidney is so hilariously, love-ably, honest, it makes me wish I had a friend just like him.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Light-hearted, easy viewing.","Peter Klaven is set to marry, but doesn't have a best man, he attempts several man dates, and eventually finds Sydney Fife, a wild ocean of testosterone.It's an enjoyable movie, and it's funny, but best of all, it is so incredibly easy to relate to. There's almost a stigma attached to finding friends, and it can be really difficult to find male friends. I don't actually have many friends that are guys, I have one, so I hoped for some tips.Lots of laughs out loud moments, it's a good script, Peter's man dates were really funny.

Jason Segel is the perfect contrast, the pair combine so well.Very well meaning, enjoyable.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Nutshell Review: I Love You, Man","I Love You, Man is a delightful film not just for its brand of humour which worked almost all the time, nor because it stars the bunch of contemporary jokers who have taken Hollywood by storm, but because it had a meaningful story to tell, and has translated that key insight of friendships and relationships for the big screen effortlessly, wrapping up some deep, intrinsic behavioural observation deceptively behind a curtain of laughter.Like the 40 Year Old Virgin in its quest for a woman to get laid with to pop his cherry, this film works on the reverse in its protagonist's quest for a male friend, since Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) has no problems with female friendship as he's the quintessential ladies man, only that he's about to marry his fiancé Zooey (Rashida Jones). Since the bride has a maid of honour, it's up to Peter to find a balance in a best man, only that he hasn't really had a man friend for the longest time, and so begins a crazy montage of hooking up with casual friends in the hope of striking gold.It might seem like a hypothetical situation, but as the film progressed, it brings to mind how many of us have friends (male or female) that we sometimes take for granted in knowing that they'll always be there for us. Only a reality check brings up the fact that everyone has their own personal lives to lead, and it wouldn't be nice to impose (mid-life crisis singles, hands up here), especially not with an ulterior motive. Some of us too when having a girlfriend, tend to allow male friends to fall on the wayside as we skirt chase, and depending on whether you get someone who provides that much leeway as Zooey, you can kiss goodbye to those male-bonding sessions.Then there's the difference between the premise of a girl's night out, and a guy's, and the dynamics of what happens within the groups. It can be somewhat stereotypical here in the film, but you get the drift as the film lays it all out on the table, with the girls talking about the boy-stuff behind their backs, and the worst bit being that cause for comparison, and the guys, well, talk about what else, sex! There are some lines clearly drawn here in what can, or cannot be discussed, and how much of that you can bring to the table, and how much you can take away from. A secret's a secret, and should stay that way with clear segregation in order to prevent upsetting anyone. Talk about compromises and ""truth"".If what you're saying is that it reeks of hypocrisy, then yes, sometimes it does, and the married couple played by Jaime Pressly and Jon Favreau (yes, he who directed Iron Man) epitomizes the crankiness of a marriage with its idiosyncrasies, and the hypocrisies that come with presenting a united front, and worse of all, trading favours in both directions. They have some of the best lines and insane moments in the film, and poor Jon has got to suffer two verbal abuses (for you to watch and find out).Many of us who have remembered Jason Segel's comical turn in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and here he cuts his Sydney Fife both ways, one an alpha male type who seems way cool with his frat boy sensibilities, which is actually a facade for a lonely life he leads in his garage where he can be the man he actually is. As the friendship between Peter and Sydney grow from their numerous hanging out sessions, from short drinking sessions to weekend rendezvous just to jam to their favourite tunes, so too does the strain in Peter and Zooey's relationship, because as the saying goes, two's a company, and three's a crowd. This aspect serves as an adversary in the film, though it doesn't come unexpected when it suddenly dawns upon Peter that he can't have two birds in one hand. Being the novice in this aspect of a man-friend relationship here, there are many times Peter trips up, and the experienced us would know that it's perfect danger territory to find yourself in.And who would have thought friendship and relationships could be such a chore, especially when expectations start flying around being that spanner ready to be thrown in the works. As a comedy, this film hit plenty of right spots in eliciting laughter from the audience, with funny lines that do work, and carefully crafted characters in Peter (with his nonsensical one- liner conversation endings, and nicknames), and Sydney being quite multi-dimensional. And what's a film like this about man-friends without that dose of fanboy-dom in it, with the Incredible Hulk Lou Ferrigno playing himself in a very short supporting role, and many other film references thrown in for good measure too?I Love You, Man is an excellent story on friendship, and what makes friendship tick. For that and its healthy dose of comedy, and a great spin on the tired romantic-comedy genre, it goes without a surprise into my list of contenders for top films of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

See the film and find out for yourself.I really enjoyed this film but can pretty much guarantee many won't...such as my wife. This is because the film is filled with many awkward moments....scenes that make your skin crawl a bit. I actually LIKE that sort of humor...but it's certainly not for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gut bustingly funny and actually endearing,"When I first heard about this movie, I became a little irritated. The premise seemed to me like a ""romantic comedy for gays"" except with a few lines to make it a ""bromance."" It makes sense, as most guys in the target age group (high schoolers and college aged) are quite uncomfortable discussing sexual orientation in any context (Don't believe me? Try raising the topic with your best buddies). It seemed like it was wimping out instead of taking a chance and really making a movie that could make said guys comfortable about this sort of thing.This may be the film's intention, but it hides it well. The romance between Peter (Paul Rudd) and Zooey (Rashida Jones) is well-integrated and quite important to the story. If anything, it represents a major stepping stone.I approached this film with much trepidation; I don't especially like Judd Apatow movies. Some of the stuff is funny, but a lot of it is too understated, like Clark Duke in ""Sex Drive"" or ""Kick Ass"" (watch the trailers of either one of those movies and when the dorky kid with glasses talks, you'll see what I mean). Worse, Jason Segel wrote and starred in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" a movie of that ilk that I didn't like at all. Fortunately, none of those characteristics made into this movie. The jokes flow naturally and the film has energy and chemistry between the actors. This result is 90+ minutes of absolute hilarity.Peter (Paul Rudd) has always been a ladies man. Women love him, and he finds them very easy to talk to. That's one of the reasons why Zooey (Rashida Jones) falls head over heels for him, and when he proposes, she accepts. But once wedding plans get underway, he realizes that he has no best guy friends to make up his share of the wedding party. So with his friends encouragement, he sets out to find a new best guy friend. After a few disastrous ""man dates,"" he runs into Sydney (Jason Segel), a fun loving guy with a lot of advice on how to break loose and have fun.The best thing about this movie is that everything unfolds naturally. True, it follows the familiar beats of the genre, but nothing that happens is contrived. The characters actions are genuine and make sense from what we know about them, and that makes it more honest (not to mention effective.The leads are great. Paul Rudd tones down the ""funny smartass"" personality that made him famous and instead acts like a likable guy, albeit without male/male social skills and a penchant for creating bad nicknames and catchphrases. Peter is an easy guy to like, and he has good chemistry with both of his co-stars, Rashida Jones and Jason Segel. Segel is a revelation. He's one of the most likable characters I've seen on screen in a long time. He's easy going and earnest, the type of guy anyone would want as a best friend. However, some of his philosophies on life and social skills come off as scripted, and try as he might, Segel isn't able to make them sound otherwise. Rashida Jones is also very good (looking and sounding like Jessica Alba, only more relaxed). When Peter tells her about Sydney, she's excited for him. If us guys could all have such wives, we'd be in heaven. As the gay brother who is on hand to give advice about ""man dating,"" Andy Samberg is far less irritating and obnoxious than he was in the utterly awful ""Hot Rod,"" which is near the top of my list of one of the worst movies ever made.John Hamburg is making a comedy, and like the best ones, he lets everything flow naturally. The humor isn't kept on mute, or drained of energy, or kept low-key. It's totally natural, and that's what makes this such a funny, and dare I say it, touching, comedy. I was actually discussing this film with my best guy friend, and the movie reminded us quite strongly of the sort of things we would do when we were in college together. Movies that have establish that kind of a connection with a viewer don't come along very often.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Typical Hollywood: full of stupidity, cliché's, annoying people, no humor","I don't know why I still hold out hope that movies like this will actually make me laugh or feel good. My wife really wanted to see this, but I was having doubts, after disliking similar ""comedies"" like ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""Knocked up"". It was more awkward and painfully embarrassing than funny. I don't think I laughed once. Pretty much all of the characters ranged from bland and boring (Paul Rudd, his fiancé,) to enraging jerks (Jason Segal, John Favreau, who played the most vile, despicable character, ever. The one married to the annoying stick figure Jamie Pressley. I wanted to kill him.) Also, I own two dogs. Letting one's dog crap on a busy sidewalk or beach is NOT FUNNY. It should earn you a good beating. The wedding at the end was especially horrible. People don't act like that! Also, while I have nothing against gay people, the portrayal of the gay brother who tries to have sex with straight men (and succeeds?!?) is not funny, just really skeevy. Why this got so many favorable reviews is just wrong and sad.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Bro-mantic Comedy That Actually Works!,"While most romantic comedies offer a simple formula, ""I Love You, Man,"" offers a slight variation of the tried and true. In this film, our main character has already found the one and is instead in search of a some bro-love. While the concept may sound awkward at first, rest assured that the film keeps the laughs coming often enough that things never get weird.Paul Rudd, whose resurrected career has been on a roll as of late, plays Pete, a successful real estate agent on the verge of marrying his dream girl, played by Rashida Jones (""Cop Out""). There's just one kink, though, as Pete is socially awkward and without male companionship, which means he's going to have a difficult time locking down a best man for his wedding. Enter Sydney, played by Jason Segal (""How I Met Your Mother""), who stumbles into Pete's life after crashing one of his open house events. The two hit it off, jam to a bit of Rush here and there, and before long, the two have a relationship that rivals that of Pete's impending nuptials.""I Love You, Man"" is a simply fun twist on an old genre. Rudd and Segal have great chemistry together (as hinted at in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and you buy that they are best-buds. Not only is the film heavy on Rush tunes (always a plus, in my book) but the band themselves perform within the movie. Also in house are roles from the likes of Jane Curtain, J.K. Simmons, Andy Samberg, Jon Favreau, Jaime Pressly and the Incredible Hulk himself, Lou Ferrigno. On the downside, the film doesn't really offer anything new outside of its ""bro-mance"" angle, and in turn, is as by the numbers and predictable as it gets. In spite of this, though, it's a fun, feel-good film that is never short on laughs. Worth a watch for anyone who appreciates the Judd Apatow generation of comedies.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
some funny moments,"Another cookie cutter movie ridden with lots of sex jokes. I am not a big fan of these types of movies (movies like The 40 Year Old Virgin and The Wedding Crashers) and that is how this movie starts. The acting was average at best, at most times, below average, the character playing Zooey (Rashida Jones)was particularly bad, but she had a small part. This movie was going to receive almost a failing rating (like a 4 or a 5) but then they inserted Sidney (Jason Segel) and he played an amazing part. He makes the movie alone and up my rating to a 6. The movie really moved with him and left all of the sex jokes and the ones that were inserted were well places. The movie moved the same way most movies do and ended the way I expected. So to sum up this movie, it was bad, then saved by a good actor, and pretty much ended the way I expected. Nothing great, not bad, worth watching if one has the time but nothing worth watching twice, 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Some Good Laughs,"Everyone would like to have a best friend or best man like Sydney Fife (Jason Segel). Peter (Paul Rudd) is engaged to the girl of his dreams and faced with an upcoming wedding realizes he has no male friends and certainly none close enough to be his best man. That is where Sydney comes into play. This movie strikes at the heart of all men who have either had their own version of a Sydney or are still looking for one. Sydney is a charming guy, he's personable, and opinionated, and before long he and Peter have become inseparable. Of course none of this is what Peter's fiancé has in mind.While there are some laughs to be had, and I think you see where I'm going with this, this is your basic romantic-comedy which means that it is very formula based. The movie is like a dozen other films with just a little bit of new stuff thrown on top. Paul Rudd is good, as always, and give his standard nice guy act. It was also great to see Lou Ferigno without green paint though he still could not escape the Hulk reference and probably never will. Jason Segel provides one of the better performances in the film, but he has plenty of models to refer to in other films in order to get it right.Certainly the movie can only be credited with all the great actors in the film. Rudd is joined by J.K. Simmons and Jane Curtain as dad and mom and little brother is Andy Samberg. It is always good seeing Jon Favreau on screen and he's paired up with Jaime Pressly. John Hamburg makes his leap from directing television with I Love You, Man and some great scripts.The film has to get in line with a lot of other very similar movies but that doesn't make it too much less funny. The film would do a lot better to have relied on its original material rather than the heavily formulated script. Given Hamburg's ability to turn out a decent script it is too bad that he could not save an entirely new script for himself to direct here.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Very likable and sweet, a great date/group movie.","Though you won't find the name Judd Apatow on this film at all, he certainly has a hand in it, as his influence is all over the film. However, unlike most of the movies that can certainly be grouped with this one, 'I Love You, Man' is a movie almost anyone can enjoy, even women and kids. It's the lightest, warmest, and the best for buddies of either sex to see. It's a delightful comedy that will make you laugh throughout and brighten your day.Whether it be the great buddy chemistry between the leads, or the simply hysterical supporting cast, I found myself loving this movie. Like director John Hamburg's previous effort, 'Along Came Polly', the movie is incredibly likable because it relies on the awkward humor that Paul Rudd does pretty much perfectly, playing off the happy-go-lucky humor of Jason Segel.Rudd is likable and reliable as usual in a role showcasing the best of his abilities (I really can't say how happy I am that he's finally getting leading roles), and unlike in 'Role Models', he's the undisputed lead here. Segel is a character in Rudd's story, his life, and his journey to find a friend, and essentially, become a complete person before his life changes for the better. Segel is at his best in a role as what appears to be the perfect friend (I would hang out with this guy for days). Rashida Jones is adorable and likable as Rudd's fiancé, and it's a role that most actresses would've over done (Jaime Pressly's performance should remind people of how it could've been over done), and Jones plays it with an ease that makes her likable.The supporting cast is what makes the movie great. It's the foundation of characters played by Thomas Lennon, Joe Lo Truglio, Jon Favreau, Jaime Pressly, and Andy Samberg that completes the movie and makes it worth watching (because, let's face it, the movie wouldn't be that great if Rudd and Segel just sat around bro-ing out for 2 hours). Lennon and Truglio are hilarious as candidates for Peter's best man position, and Lennon will bring down the house as Doug, with his classic monologue about how he feels when his advances towards Peter are rejected. Truglio is great in yet another small cameo that stacks up with his previous appearances in 'Pineapple Express' and 'Superbad', as well as the icing on the cake that was 'Role Models' (he's an example of the whole ""everyone will like this movie"" thing. Jon Favreau is hysterical in his part as a cynical ass that makes you go, ""this guy directed 'Iron Man'?"".I think the reason most people will like this one is because it'll put a smile on most people's faces. It's a generally happy movie that is a good movie to see in a group to start off a night, and is even a decent date movie. It's got jokes that even kids can like (though most of the film is obviously not appropriate for them...what I'm saying is if they HAVE to see one of these movies, this is the one for them). I really enjoyed this movie, it left a good taste in my mouth, and my friends loved it too.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"No beating around the bush, this was a great comedy.","The makers of the film tried to follow in the style of director Judd Apatow, you know add in some raunchiness, but not too much of it, but at the same time make it heartwarming and relatable. Like The 40-Year Old Virgin(2005), and Knocked Up(2007) where.The story starts with Peter(Paul Rudd) who purposes to his longtime girlfriend Zooey(Rashida Jones), and she says yes. And should be smooth sailing from there right, well not so much. Peter quickly discovers that he has no best man for his wedding, the painful fact is that Peter has never really had a male friend, most of his best friends are females. So Peter goes out on a search by going on a couple of man dates, in hopes to find the perfect B.F.F.. But comes close to giving up, until he meets Sydney(Jason Segel), a wild fun loving guy. Peter and Sydney soon become the best of friends, has Sydney shows Peter on how to be wild and crazy. But will it put a strain on his relationship with Zooey?One funny comedy, that hits it's mark perfectly. And a great bunch of characters, that don't over do it either. Paul Rudd is great, always, he had better chemistry with Rashida Jones and Jason Segel, then he had with Elizabeth Banks and Seann William Scott. Rashida Jones is also great in her role, although she doesn't quite get the big laughs, she endearing and believable in her role. Jason Segel was perfectly cast also, he managed to get some good laughs. And rest of the supporting cast are memorable. Including Lou Ferrigno as himself.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
To laugh...,"Here's a comedy that, undeniably and more than something like ""Role Models"", contains many elements of Judd Apatow's cinema. It's something that has to be said when you see a cast led by Paul Rudd and Jason Segel, a script that is based on the idea of male friendship and one or two characters who suffer of what I once called –actually, probably everyone did- the 'Apatow Syndrome'. However, it has nothing to do with Apatow and, as in ""Role Models"", there are some differences to be found and in these differences ""I love you, Man"" emerges like a good comedy. It's another thing altogether to say that it's a good movie.What the film carries (we could say 'drags' too) from Apatow is a certain familiarity of ideas. The script by director John Hamburg and Larry Levin centers on Peter Klaven, a lonely man who's about to marry Zooey. The thing is that Zooey and her girlfriends are worried about the fact that Peter doesn't have any friends. It's fair to stop and to say that the Peter character is played by Paul Rudd, in what's an extension of the role established in ""Knocked Up"" and slightly modified by David Wain in ""Role Models"": a laid-back man, not very sociable, dedicated to his wife and work, not sure of who his truly friends are. It's a role Rudd plays beautifully; by heart, yes, but it's brilliant. The fact that he meets Sydney and that he turns to be this lovable, sensitive, musical, honest, charming, hippie man played by Jason Segel takes us inevitably back to the character Segel played in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". Why wouldn't someone become a friend of Sydney? He's cool and he plays the guitar.Anyway, the thing is that Sydney starts gaining importance in Peter's life and this drives Peter and Zooey apartAnd they're getting married in two weeks. There's not much more than that as far as the plot goes, and you know how it ends. So, I don't know if Hamburg was trying to pay Apatow tribute or what. His last directing credit is ""Along Came Polly"", a film which is far from Apatow land. But the truth is that, at the end of the day, ""I love you, Man"" is not more Apatow than the things I've mentioned, and Hamburg makes a rare comedy of it by taking some chancesNot without being sentimental, of course.You see, Apatow's first idea of cinema was one of a non-stop comedy (you can watch ""Anchorman"" any time) that slowly evolved into a more complex, dramatic line –probably the result of his own personal life- that, as a director, reached its peak in ""Knocked Up"". An idea of more developed characters, a detailed treatment of male bonding (friendship, yes), a particular interest in husband/wife relationship and a sometimes excessive sentimentalism recently concluded in complete failure: ""Funny People"". But what we shouldn't forget is that, no matter how and when, Apatow was always looking for comedy, and we could laugh with his films. Well, ""Funny People"" is not funny.All the elements of a modern American comedy can sometimes confuse the viewer or even a director. The good news is that Hamburg knows what he wants his picture to be: a comedy, just a comedy. He plays his cards there and because he does it with balls he succeeds. The romantic elements are very few, the sentimentalism is there, but more as an excuse than ever before during this decade. Meanwhile, the friendship thing is natural and real, but not revealing, as in introducing a new light to the matter.Where ""I love you, Man"" has its heart is in the comedy. A comedy that consists in putting the right characters in the right place at the right time so they can say the right things to make us laugh. This sounds redundant, but it has to because it has to be noted that it is planned: the casting is perfect (the two leads of course, and supporting characters by Jon Favreau and Jamie Pressly leading the game; with a nice appearance by Thomas Lennon) and the camera is not too risky so the actors can do what they have to.But it's not that simple, because the planning includes the complexity of characters, and that's precisely why the actors need to be perfect. Say what you want, but there's not a comic line in the film that doesn't com from one of the characters' sheer nature. The rare quality of ""I love you, Man"" has to do with the fact that everything that makes us laugh truly seems like something a character, male or female, would say. That character, in that place, at that time. It's basic stuff, but it's rarely seen in a genre that depends, desperately, on moments that are simply there for the sake of a laugh. Here, in a film with not a lot of music, in a film that could be categorized at times of ""quiet comedy"", we believe what people say. And of course, we laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Been There, Done that","I should have known what I was getting into from the hype. Here we go again: lovable boy-man needs help with his love life. Enter goofy, off-beat character who sets him on the right path to sexual bliss. What totally turned me off early on was the long, completely unnecessary sequence about flatulence. These ""man"" movies always have to have the requisite scene about bodily functions to get all the men howling and stomping the floor and rocking back and forth in their chairs. From there, we get another big scene about masturbation. And so on and so on. We've got the usual comic talents that are in all these flicks--with the only one missing was the shouting, F___word sprouting Seth Rogan. Now that would really have given this bomb some class.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delivers what it sets out to do with an easy to watch comedy,"Paul Rudd has managed to do a good job of delivering a solid ""normal guy"" comic lead in comedies that are amusing if not particularly amazing. This is not a criticism though because I do find the films he has been in recently to be perfectly enjoyable, with a consistent comic air and a good handful of laughs spread across a plot that, while not engaging or amazing, is not offensively simple or crass either. This track record is what brought me to I Love You Man because I felt like I knew what to expect from the film and also that I was fairly confident that it would meet my expectations and maybe even be a bit better than I expected. I'm not trying to say that if it was weak that I could enjoy it because I thought it would be weak and was prepared for that, but just that the film needs to deliver what it proposes to do and satisfy on those terms – which given how many poor comedies and blockbusters come out of Hollywood, is not as easy as it sounds.Fortunately, ILYM does do this and it does it in a way that will please the majority of viewers. The plot is simple and sets up the obvious gags but does also produce a solid ""bromance"" narrative, which is enjoyable while not saying much more than the basics about the nature of modern men. What helps it a great deal is that it is funny. The tone of it is well maintained and it did keep me in the mood to laugh, which is half the battle. It manages this through the main characters being likable in the most part as well as having plenty of pretty funny asides or episodes based on plot or character, which are again delivered well by a cast containing endless faces that will be familiar to anyone who watches US comedy on even a semi-regular basis.I'm not sure that Paul Rudd is close to being an all-round leading man type of actor but certainly this type of film (like some of his other recent turns) plays to his strengths. He is comically awkward but yet also keeps the audience with him by being easy to like – helped by the film being light on crude or crass comedy, which can put me off some characters. He works well with TV comedian Segel, who is perhaps a less engaging and likable character but does convince within it and is funny. Beyond the two of them everyone else is pretty much in a supporting role and, as well as having lots of famous faces, they do mostly deliver laughs in ""asides"". Pressly and Favreau are both very good at this and steal a lot of scenes. I liked The Office's Jones turn as the fiancé as I generally like her delivery. There are many other faces to recognise (such as Simmons, Samberg, Curtin, Chaandrasekhar, Ferrigno, Wilmore) and some of them do provide value even if others only provide a face.Overall though, ILYM delivers what it sets its stall out to do – which is a gentle and funny comedy that is easy to watch and entertaining even if it is fleeting and not particularly memorable as a film in and of itself. Rudd plays to his strengths and provides the thin plot with a likable and engaging core, while the material is very funny at best and amusing at worst. Not a classic by any means but it has laughs and it has charm.",,Anonymous,Romance
Love,"I will say off the bat I hated the ended. It was like they ran out of time and the director said, ""just stop the film here"". The rest of the story was pretty good. I enjoyed the film, but I can see people hating it. All the characters have the personalities of the cast. So if you do not like any of these people as an actor or actress, you will hate the film. Paul Rudd was great in this film. His dialog was really funny. Jason Segel was a good double, but not his best movie. The movie had an excellent cast and I can say I enjoyed them all. Lou Ferrigno was a funny touch. I really think my favorite duo from the movie were Jon Favreau and Jaime Pressly. Some of the dialog was just great. So overall, a pretty good movie aside from some of the story flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
No Substance,"I really enjoyed the premise of the movie. I was pleasantly surprised with all the familiar faces are I saw. The most intriguing aspect of the film, a man who can form positive relationships with woman but is hopeless with men and goes on a journey to develop fruitful hetero male friendships was rushed. Paul Rudd's character wasn't explored enough. The underlying issues of his were never addressed. There was potential with Favreau's character but never realised. The worst aspect of the movie is the romantic couple because there is no chemistry and since they aren't the focus of the film it never develops.I loved the plot and the cast. The runtime was short but not utilised to it's potential. The phycology of male friendships wasn't explored. Favreau was a highlight. The vulgarity and secularist wedding was hindering. The best wedding movies involve some sort of religious or culture element but this has none. The running jokes were dull especially anything involving any male character other than the main characters. A solid 2 points could have been earned if the characters weren't unbearable weird, annoying, and unfunny.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ode to the homey cave-man,"I'm one of the few straight guys who watches Jennifer, Sandra and Julia. I know, i know... So it is not surprising that i can relate to the main character in this remarkable fresh yet very cliché romantic comedy....about guys!! And what kind of guys? Well, guys you rarely see in American comedies. In the Netherlands, where i live, this 'in-touch-with-his-feelings/women' kind of guy is much more mainstream, but in America Hollywood has a tendency to exploit the idea of the typical male and typical female. There is a tendency to split the female and male world to the extreme. And that is not reality.This movie deals with a normal guy with normal feminine features. Unfortunaltely, also in this movie, these features are exaggerated. Same with his girlfriends female friends. So in the first half hour this movie seems to head for the cliché comedy but then Jason Segel's character appears and the movie is saved. Not only a gifted actor but also a character that is going to give the premise of this movie it's 'right of existence'. The Segels character is interesting because he is in touch with his female side but..a real cave-man, which makes him the perfect teacher for our troubled main character. He is the only one who forgives his friend all his well-intended but very irritating attempts to fit in. Through his eyes we see the main character struggling with the universal theme of 'be just yourself'.The movie is good for normal guys, living in the states who really think that males portrayed in mainstream Hollywood are men that women will date and marry.. Because i think they don't. The movie is also good for those men who have female friends and are accused of being gay. The movie is also good for those women who think that they have to change a man (all women do unfortunately, except for my girlfriend. Thank you sweetheart) and the movie is above all good for those men who have a troubled relationship with the 'inner cave-man'.a funny tale and rehabilitation of the homey cave-man!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Go see this movie!,"Just saw a screening of this movie. It was great. Paul Rudd & Jason Segel are an amazing match - we've seen that in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" - their chemistry is natural...and it just works. I laughed A lot during this movie. It's been a while since I've run across a comedy that is smarter than most in terms of humor.The other supporting characters are quirky, delicious... Jamie Pressley plays to perfection. I recommend this movie to everyone for a great laugh...it's a very feel-good movie. Oh, and Rashida Jones was cute, lovable and had a great character to play.

Men Need Love Too...,"Paul Rudd, alum of several Judd Apatow movies such as Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin, stars as Peter Klaven who, mere weeks away from his wedding to Zooey (Rashida Jones of ""The Office"" fame), realizes that he has no male friends. This isn't due to social ineptitude, however; Peter gets along well with both sexes but primarily his sensitivity is attuned to friendships with women. In order to seek out a best man aside from his gay brother (SNL's Andy Samberg) or father, Peter goes on several ""man dates"" in order to deepen his pool of males with whom to bond. One man in particular, Forgetting Sarah Marshall's Jason Segel, appropriately fits the bill, and the two men embark on a friendship that forms the core of this movie.I Love You, Man explores an interesting facet of male relationships, an area often twisted in other movies into homosexual innuendo. Fortunately, though, the story of I Love You, Man doesn't take this path, instead choosing to enlighten the viewer through crude humor, slapstick comedy, and witty discussion. Though not written by Apatow, those who saw his aforementioned movies will undoubtedly enjoy what this movie brings to the table. Rudd and Segel are a great comedy team; it's nice to see Rudd especially break out on his own. There are several points throughout the movie where the ""man dates"" closely resemble heterosexual dates, and Rudd shows his acting skill at making the situation uncomfortable for both his character and the viewers.All in all, I Love You, Man is a solid comedy, closely following Knocked Up as a movie that can be enjoyed both by men who enjoy off-color humor, as well as women who will appreciate the emotional back-and-forth between the characters involved.

A fresh breath of air to the relationship movie,"We all know that Hollywood seems to have the originality of a spastic Xerox machine;in other words,find a successful formula and there'll be about eighteen different takes or copies of it lying in wait. Never does the dearth of originality seem to raise its big old ugly head than in relationship movies,sometimes called romantic comedies or ""rom coms"". Even when different angles seem to be explored,they still come to the same,tired wrap-up that involve the cute major players,boy and girl,to find love in each others' arms despite the obstacles. Every once in a while,I'm relieved to say,you do run across a film that decides to mine the margins of these love stories to make a movie.I submit to you I Love You Man,made with the sensibility--and at least two members of the stable of actors--of a Judd Apatow/Greg Mottola film,and VERY appreciated.Peter Klaven(Paul Rudd,the nicest,most likable mensch in movies and TV today,with a punum you could just....)is a reasonably successful Real Estate agent in Southern California whose engagement to Zoe(Rashida Jones,the girlfriend from Heaven)couldn't be going better. They're very much in love and she gets his silly,sometimes lame persona and he appreciates her patience and physical receptiveness. Everything's going well for their impending connubial bliss,save one thing:Peter has no guy friends. None. While Ol' Pete has a great touch with the ladies,he has almost no bro bonding to fall back on.This previous situation,once not considered a problem if even considered at all now weighs upon our hero,and he gets help(both solicited and not)from family--Mom(Jane Curtin)and bro(Andy Samberg)--and from fiancé herself. The phrase 'hilarity ensues' is overused but,in these instances,they apply.Then walks into an open house Sidney Fife(Jason Segel,physically the same from Forgetting Sarah Marshall,but character-wise a near one-eighty),an investment broker whose own,self-actualized sense of zen and bro-supreme self-sufficiency hits it off perfectly with Peter,balancing the groom-to-be's pleasant but feminine recessive qualities.Featuring a supporting cast that doesn't try to stand out but still does: Curtin,Samber,J.K.Simmons(as Peter's dad),Tom Lennon(as a potential guy friend ""suitor""),Sarah Burns(as one of Zoe's more pathetic friends),Jaime Pressly(as Zoe's perpetually angry married friend),Jon Favreau(as Pressly's dickish husband)and Lou Ferrigno(as...well,Lou Ferrigno),this film has a delightful time bringing to screen a ""love"" story angle that is as fresh,real and relatively ignored in most movies starring(pick any two of the following):Matthew McConaughey,Kate Hudson,Sandra Bullock,Meg Ryan,Hugh Grant,Ryan Reynolds,Renee Zellweger,Richard Gere or Reese Witherspoon. Co-writer John Hamburg directs this film,and he seems to be perfectly fine with letting this film amble along to its conclusion,scattering more than its share of laughs and pratfalls along the way.

Immortan Rudd,Great comedy about male relationships and bromance that's done in a nice and refreshing way. Guy is going to get married and rather than focus on that like every romcom ever it shifts to focus on the fact that he has no healthy male friends and how that lack of friends has left him with a hole he didn't know he had.

This film's goal was to create a strong relationship between two friends, and have the ending carry meaning and feel the right way in just 1hr45, which isn't an easy task even for formulaic Hollywood.It's actually funnier than expected, with some genuinely funny moments and secondary characters, and although it's not as powerful as the title claims, it's still solid and a fun watch that isn't boring at any particular moment.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Utterly hilarious in some areas, but could have been a lot better","Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) proposes to his girlfriend Zooey (Rashida Jones), and rather romantically, has everything already set up for the wedding. Zooey is obviously excited, and so are her girlfriends. But Peter seems to not take into account that he has no real guy friends, and thus, would be forced to stand at the front of the aisle with basically no one by his side. So, he searches for a best friend, and eventually finds Sydney Fife (Jason Segal). Only things do not stay as swimmingly as imagined.From the trailers, I Love You, Man looks like a surefire comedic hit. I practically sprang at the chance of seeing an advance screening of it for this very reason. And for the majority of the movie, it really is as funny as it looks.Rudd and Segal, Judd Apatow regulars, are hilarious acting together and apart (the former obviously working even better than the latter). Both have a great sense of comedic timing, and give their characters a surprising amount of depth. They are given the bare minimum of development throughout the film, but both breathe just enough life into the characters that they easily make them memorable. These two roles could have easily been filled by just about anyone, but they work and make the audience care because of who plays them.Rudd seems a little too old for his awkward role here, and it really shows in some of the scenes where he clearly looks like he should be younger. But nonetheless, he gives the character a such a unique voice that this fact is a little easy to overlook. Much the same goes for Segal, who walks all over Rudd in a lot of scenes. He is clearly the funnier of the two, but he manages to bring the best out of both of them. Even in the most ridiculous of scenes, Segal delivers in spades.But unfortunately, the film would have very little going for it if these two were not in it. Apatow may not be involved, but it feels like it was ripped straight from his book of tricks. Sure, dirty and offensive jokes are in right now (and thankfully are not toned down in the least), but it feels a little too close to the man than it should. Many of the jokes work, and hit the mark, but some fall so flat it hurts. It is a real shame that there are such stale moments in the film, but it just never tries to amend any of its wrongs. It practically just allows itself to revel in them.What also does not help is the film being entirely predictable. Leaving aside just how much of the film is given away in the trailers and TV spots, the film practically plays like a paint-by-numbers of recent comedies. Yes, it has the high-concept of being one of the first real bromantic comedies, and turns an age old cliché on its head (while only sidestepping into homosexual elements for actual comedy as opposed to doing so just for the sake of it). But it only uses this concept when it wants to. It feels like it wants to branch out, and really make something original of itself (why else throw in a random subplot involving Lou Ferrigno?), but ends up being held back by the constraints of wanting to play out to the Apatowian audience.Much like other Apatow films, the film also feels a bit too long. I do not understand why the man seems to have patented this idea, but it makes for some really irritating moments in otherwise superlative movies. I Love You, Man is no different. There is a huge gap in the film that continues to be funny, but just feels unwarranted. It is almost to the point of dragging itself out just to make the running time a pinch longer. And the inevitably Unrated DVD/Blu-ray is not going to help this dilemma out either.The film also falters in its treatment of the female characters. Jones has some genuinely hilarious lines sprinkled throughout the film, as do Sarah Burns and Jaime Pressly. There are some really funny exchanges between the three, but the film never seems to take advantage of the potential comic goldmine these three develop between each other. It instead seems content with amping up the interactions between Rudd and Segal, and only giving us minute doses of the other three. It is a real shame, but the material we do get is much funnier than I imagined it would be.Much the same goes for the supporting cast, headed up by Andy Samberg, J.K. Simmons, Jane Curtin, Thomas Lennon and especially, Jon Favreau. All five of these actors get to deliver some hilarious dialogue. I was almost in pain from how hard I was laughing at some of the things these guys say and do in the film. They each get a moment or two that practically steals the film from Rudd and Segal. But unfortunately, they also seem to be very undercut (especially Simmons and Curtin) in the general course of things. I realize I thought the running time was a bit too long, but it could have been a bit better swallowed had the filmmakers used more material from this incredible supporting cast. Here's hoping they get more time to shine on the DVD/Blu-ray.I really wanted to like I Love You, Man, but it is hindered by so many things that it only mildly delivers on the promises of the trailers. When it works, it is practically on fire from being so funny. But when it falls flat, it falls hard. There is so much more that this film could have done with itself, but it seems content with simply being average.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""I Love You, Man"" is a funny movie, and that's all it needs to be","Easily the single most important thing in any comedy is its strike rate when it comes to the jokes. ""I Love You, Man"" isn't very good from a visual technical perspective (in fact some of the direction is downright heavy-handed and annoying), but the screenplay and cast keep this comedy consistently funny. There are no terrible scenes, almost every joke is at least mildly amusing (at least until the slightly shaky final act of the film), and there's as much smart humor as there is dumb gross-out stuff (not 'intellectual', 'smart'), and Rudd, Segel and in a smaller role Jon Favreau really nail every line. The comic timing makes this movie.Above all else ""I Love You, Man"" is a triumph of comedic acting. The screenplay, by director John Hamburg and Larry Levin (perhaps most notable for writing Seinfeld classics ""The Limo"" and ""The Boyfriend""), is often very funny, but on more than one occasion falls completely flat, and also reveals a dependency on catchphrases and repeated jokes which could have killed the movie. If I were reading the screenplay and 'slap da bass' was said for the hundredth time I would just sigh and throw it in the trash. With Paul Rudd's impeccable comic timing and genuinely convincing take on his character (which, like the rest of the characters here, is really not brought to life by the writing all that well), it had me in stitches.I don't want to take too much credit away from the screenwriters because this is a (very) funny and enjoyable comedy, but I do have to mention that where ""I Love You, Man"" falls short of the standard for Apatow productions (and although it's hard to believe this is not one) is in the characterizations. It's far from being as raunchy as those, and is not really as frequently over-the-top, so you'd think there would be more space in the writing for good quality characterization, but these characters are all really thin, and with a lesser cast the movie would not have been nearly as much fun. Now, to the screenplay's credit there are a lot of very effective comedy set-pieces, and the movie's consistently funny. I do suspect it's all a cunning plot to bring back Lou Ferrigno jokes, but the cast pull even THAT off (that includes Ferrigno himself).The entire movie falls apart just a bit when we get to the inevitable wedding scene, but it's not enough to really undo the movie (which almost veers into ""*insert crappy lowbrow maudlin sentimentality-laden wedding comedy here*"" territory before quickly recovering), and while ""I Love You, Man"" only provides a few truly uproarious laughs it is a consistently amusing movie which kept me and the audience I was with giggling and laughing throughout, and Hamburg as director gets the comic timing absolutely right, much like Segel and Rudd do. This is probably the best movie in which Rudd has played a lead role, and is definitely better than last year's ""Role Models"". The difference in the quality and smarts of both movies is evident in that ""Role Models"" has a lot of KISS jokes and ""I Love You, Man"" has a lot of Rush jokes (and an appearance from Rush). It's just a smart and funny movie, and while not a classic for several reasons I've already talked about, it is always funny and isn't that really why we go to comedies, to laugh?",,Anonymous,Romance
Lucky Leprechaun,"Greetings again from the darkness. Directed by John Hamburg (Along Came Polly) and starring Paul Rudd and Jason Segal, there really isn't much doubt what type of comedy we are in for. What I like about this one is the twist on the old comedy rule that the humor must come from the guy's struggle to understand women. Here it is regular guy Paul Rudd struggling in the male bonding department ... actually he has no male friends.While seemingly the perfect boyfriend and prize catch for Rashida Jones (real life daughter of Quincy Jones and Julie Lipton), Mr Rudd has no one to be his best man. The real fun begins when carefree Jason Segal shows up at Realtor Rudd's open house ... the listing is Lou Ferrigno's mansion - replete with Hulk statue in the backyard. Rudd and Segal commence to bonding at the man-cave while belting out songs from supergroup Rush.Rashida Jones is the typical girl who spews all secrets to her friends, one of which is played by Jaime Pressly, whose awfully loud marriage to jerk Jon Favreau provides some ongoing side humor. Predictably, Rudd and Segal's bonding begins to drive a wedge between Rudd and Rashida, which of course leads to the real awakening in their relationship. No matter ... the jokes are funny and situations are real and believable, which generates most of the laughter. Funny stuff ... with harsh language. Gotta give any movie a chance when it features 1970's icons like Ferrigno and Rush.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I must say the dialogues of the movie makes it work big time,"I LOVE YOU, MAN – CATCH IT ( B ) Its one of those movies which sometimes makes you laugh really hard at sometimes you fell like what the hell just happened? I must say the dialogues of the movie makes it work big time, though its cheap and things like you never want to hear about but C'mon that makes it different and funny. I really liked Jason Segel, he played his role so laid back and with an ease that it comes off very natural. Paul Rudd is getting pro at comedy, I liked him but at sometimes he gets little over the top. Rashida Jones did a fine job and she brought freshness to the movie. Andy Samberg, Jaime Pressley is Hilarious. Overall a great buddy movie which can be enjoyed a lot.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mildly humorous.,This is one of those mildly amusing but otherwise forgettable movies that tries to bring humor to an otherwise humorless subject. A guy trying to find a friend? It's not exactly a subject that provokes mirth but who knows? Everyone has different tastes for humor and apparently the producers of this movie felt that this story would cause an audience to laugh. They were wrong. The movie does succeed in inducing a few chuckles but no way does it even come close to making one guffaw. The blandness of the material is equaled only by the weakness of the acting. Paul Rudd reminds one of a second-rate Dustin Hoffman and the rest of the cast is equally insipid. But it's not their fault. Material is material and even the most inspired acting could not have saved this movie from the jaws of mediocrity where it most surely belongs.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Heart, satire and potty humour","Curiously, the buzz surrounding the latest R rated adult comedy I Love You, Man is fairly superficial as many of the media eyes are on the clever creation of buzz word de jour 'bromance', meaning a platonic bond between two men in the spirit of a traditional romantic comedy. Now I don't know too much about all that, nor do I truly care. What I am concerned with however, and what I feel should be first and foremost on all accounts is how incredibly funny this movie really is.What happens when you put two comedic actors who can do no wrong in a vehicle with an original premise and an experienced comedic director? Well, you get I Love You, Man which is one of the funniest comedies in years. Not quite as good as Superbed, better than Forrgetting Sara Marshall and about on par with Tropic thunder, leads Paul Rudd and Jason Segel anchor director John Hamburg's film so securely it adds a complete additional layer of heart and gravitas to material that could have been executed disastrously.With both Rudd and Segel in recent years we have seen they can carry a movie, having starred as leads in Role Models and Forgetting Sara Marshall (which Rudd also starred in) respectively and uniting them as co-leads works fantastically. Neither sinks to a stereotype or falls to a role they have previously played nor do they play the hilarious (but not silly for the record) premise anything but straight. The duo score massive laughs together and apart and a fantastic supporting cast highlights all the talent involved marvelously.Rudd stars as Peter Klaven a freshly engaged real-estate agent who has always been more of a girls-man then a best buddy guy. With the wedding approaching Peter soon realizes he has no close enough friends that could serve as a best man, or even a proper wedding party for that matter. So Peter does what any mature professional would do. he recruits his gay brother to set him up on man dates to find a suitable suitor for his big day. After a string of failed, sometimes homoerrotic ventures Peter meets Sidney Fife (Segel) a slovenly but oddly charming bloke at an open house. The two hit it off and a bromance is born, but the bond puts a strain on his engagement to Zooey (a lovely and delightful Rashida Jones) and more hilarity ensues.As I mentioned Rudd and Segel are given oodles to work with by way of a supporting cast including Andy Samburg (who has evolved by leaps and bounds since Hot Rod) as Peter's gay brother, John Favreau as a disgusting family acquaintance, J.K. Simmons as Peter's father, and The Hulk, Lou Ferrigno as himself. Along with the endlessly clever writing and bountiful talent, director Hamburg also manages to blend in rib cracking potty humour, satirize rom-coms and meld it all together with a whole lot of heart and warmth. I loved it, man.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"OK, but not good","Forgetting Sarah Marshall was hysterical, but this was not.I generally like all the guys in this, but Paul Rudd's character was just so annoying.He would ruin all the funny moments by acting awkward and faggy.It was basically his gay Ben Stiller impersonation.The best thing this had going for it, aside from a great ensemble of characters, was Lou Ferrigno, and even he was not used to his potential.I fully hope that the guys that make this will be slightly more self critical before releasing their next movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I love you to, man","Societal norms are a constantly evolving beast. Time was, most people got married at 23 or 24, had kids by 25, and that's just the way it was. These days, most of my friends aren't getting married until their early to mid thirties and even those that do often get divorced and re-married in their mid thirties. Fact is, we live longer, educate longer, and mature into family life slower. Another big change of the last few decades is how we work. My father's generation got a job out of high school or college and worked for the same company for 30+ years. Your friends were your coworkers and buddies from childhood. Often you spent your whole life surrounded by mostly the same people. Childhood buds were your buds for life, for better or worse. Nowadays of course 4 or 5 or even more major career changes is not uncommon, nor is at least 1 or 2 major geographic moves. All these changes have not gone unnoticed in Hollywood, where a cottage industry has sprung up of ""coming of age"" films for those tweeners in between young adult and middle age. Paul Rudd, Judd Apatow, Seth Rogan; these people have made careers out of catering to these new social landscapes. 'I love you, man' is another in a string of light-hearted comedies that find the humor in these situations.Rudd plays Peter Klaven, an young Realtor in LA who at the beginning of the film gets engaged to his girlfriend (played by Rashida Jones who you'll probably recognize from 'The Office' or 'Parks and Recreation'). Peter, like many of Rudd's other roles, is a decent, boyish, slightly goofy guy who connects better with woman than with men. One evening, while accidentally overhearing his fiancé talking with her friends about his lack of close male friends, Peter decides he needs to get a best friend. Naturally the process doesn't go smoothly and comedy ensues.The major plot arc here is not unlike another Rudd film, 'The 40 year old virgin', but instead of romance it's friendship that we watch unfolding. Rudd, as usual, has excellent comedic timing and delivery. The jokes are decent, and there is only a minimal amount of gross out humor. Jason Segal of 'How I met your mother' (and the completely awesome 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall') plays a slightly more confident and aggressive role than you might be used to seeing him in as the new friend Sydney. The friendship chemistry between him and Rudd is decent, but maybe not quite there in my opinion. Instead I think some of the funnier moments play out between the fiancé and her friends, but all in all the movie works as a decent and fun bit of light movie fare. I would certainly recommend the movie for your NetFlix list.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Smart Comedy,"This adult script is cleverly written by John Hamburg (who also directs) and Larry Levin. They've come up with a pleasant little film that's very light weight, yet quite diverting.My only previous familiarity with Paul Rudd was ""The Object of My Affection,"" and I was very impressed with his work. To me he's a kind of American Hugh Grant, completely natural and most engaging. Here he's called on to stretch himself a bit and become more animated. He rises to the challenge nicely.Jason Segel has a colorful, off-beat role, which he handles like a breeze. He creates a sort of clumsy character who still is no dummy. Segel and Rudd beautifully play off one another in this bouncy romp. The rest of the cast all do well, and viewers who are in a light, frothy mood, can enjoy this bit of fluff.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
WAAAYYY Overrated,"I really just don't know why people like this movie so much. I typically really enjoy this genre (Anchorman, Knocked Up, etc.), but this just didn't work on any level. The friend I watched it with, who also loves pretty much any comedy, felt the same way. Throughout the entire movie, I failed to laugh once -- I only mildly chuckled a few times (rather forced chuckles at that). The movie somewhat held my interest for the first part when Paul Rudd is struggling to find a best friend, but as soon as he meets Jason Segal - when you think it will get good - it derails. The ending with the wedding was just plain brutal -- terrible writing, acting, etc. Yet, most people I talk to like this movie, which just blows my mind. I never thought I'd say this about a Paul Rudd movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Dire, at best","After reading the many reviews on IMDb and other review sites, I inserted the rental DVD and began to watch, looking forward to what seemed like a good film, the reviews were certainly laudable. Early on the F* words came out along with the gratuitously vulgar dialogue, spat out from mouths of the cast as if the use of such profane talk was so common place as to be no different from 'please' and 'thank you', any element of subtlety was absent. I'm no prude and don't mind a bit of well placed strong language when it's appropriate, but this was just an assault on my ears from the get go. Rather than shock or surprise me into laughing due to, perhaps, vulgar wit, I was left trying to make sense of the often incongruous dialogue and wondering how what they'd just said fitted their character, particularly as the vulgarities were often delivered with dead pan expression.The newer reviews on IMDb mentioned that it would be a good family film - 'one for the kids' - hardly.The story was so-so, nothing spectacular or life changing, and not remotely endearing as some others suggested. I couldn't 'connect' with any of the characters and the 'message' was superficial. I also couldn't understand why the likable and well played protagonist had such a hard time making friends in the first place, when he seemed to be the most likable and genuine person in the film, odd.I've watched many a buddy film, where one follows the protagonist's transition from one stage of life to the next, most were enjoyable for different reasons. I got the feeling with this film that the non-stop swear words and the spurting out of humourless vulgarities (at the family dinner table, office, changing room, card table, in the car etc etc) was to either paper over weak characterisation, an even weaker script or an even weaker storyline. I could not decide, so after 30 minutes gave into my growing urge to turn it off as it failed to appeal at any level whatsoeverOne of the top ten worst films I have seen in my life, had I watched it all the way, it would probably have made the top five. What a relief to turn it off and write this review instead.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Funny, But didn't live up to the Superbad or Knocked Up.","I remember the very first time I saw Superbad. My faith in comedies was renewed after seeing it, especially when it was such a tiresome year for comedy films. So many comedies flogged the silver screen marinaded by mindless computer animation, but none of them properly cut the metaphorical ice like Superbad. THEN, I saw Knocked Up. It was possibly one of the best comedies I'd seen since Weekend at Bernies. It was like Juno with an extremely gross out comedy make over. Soon after that came Pineapple Express, which offered me a few droll laughs. Forgetting Sarah Marshall Then came out and easily lived up to it's name,""Forgettable."" Now, when I went into see, 'I Love You Man' with a superb up and coming comedy star, Paul Rudd, I at least consoled myself that this has all the makings of a proper outrageous comedy which we had all come to love from Superbad and Knocked up. In absolute honesty, it could have been far better than what a majority of reviews had deemed so positive about it. I have to say that the dialog at numerous occasions was brilliant and the random lines and specifically nicknames uttered by Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) were ridiculously funny. The only problem that I had with this film was how the writers neglected the outrageous hilarity that I adored in all past movies. (Pineapple Express, Superbad etc:) Even though this movie only managed to refuge ever so slightly below the yard stick of high expectations, it still did not entirely disappoint. My advice however would be to either see it at a matinée with a bunch of close and/or good friends.Overall I believe that a film from such a movie crew deserves a good, solid, 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ant-Man needs a best man.,"'I Love You, Man (2009)' is a breezy bromantic comedy in which a soon-to-be-married man decides it's time for him to find some male friends so that one of them can be his best man at his wedding. It's easy to watch and, more importantly, easy to like, with (mostly) relatable central characters and a surprisingly relaxed atmosphere. Though it does adhere to the formula of its genre, its plot takes a bit of a backseat to its relationships. It's surprisingly effective, a feel-good movie that focuses fully on non-toxic male friendships (something especially rare considering that this is technically a 2000s comedy). It's sometimes genuinely funny (despite one or two jokes that don't hold up) and, even when it isn't, it's always enjoyable. It's also consistently good-natured. In fact, it's actually rather sweet overall. It's the sort of thing that just makes you smile. There isn't all that much to it, but there doesn't need to be. It's good. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Side characters here, coming out big. No not that way, though in a sense it is a theme in the show they have together. I'm talking about Andy Samberg and Joe Lo Truglio, who are besties in Brooklyn 99 and are in this here together. But again, they are just side characters. Still they have at least one funny scene they share here ... which is quite something to see and experience with that newfound knowledge.But generally speaking the cast here is phenomenal ... and the movie works wonders.

Aged well,"Beautifully casted. Paul Rudd is absolutely perfect in this role. Jason Segel def pulls this off. Character development has a good pace and feels genuine.Sometimes this genre does not age well, where the adults are just way overboard with the profanity, then a few years go buy and u re-watch it just gives you the impression that the characters are actually more interested in shock humour than actually being funny, (cant think of one off the top of my head)
but this movie DOES NOT DO THIS.10 years later I Love You, Man is still hilarious and actually very sweet at the same time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"If ""I Love You, Man"" isn't the best comedy of 2009, that's only because so many surprisingly strong contenders have been released this year.","The casting in I Love You, Man is a stroke of relative genius. Paul Rudd and Jason Segel are two of the funniest — and most likable — comedians working in film today, and for all of I Love You's vulgarity, these two leads keep the film afloat. The sincerity of their performances translates even during the cruder moments of oral sex and dog poo gags.Rudd plays Peter Klaven, a Real Estate agent trying desperately to sell Lou Ferrigno's mansion. He's engaged to Zooey (Rashida Jones), who asks him about his Best Man for the wedding, which provides Peter the sudden realization that he doesn't really have many male friends. ""I've always been a girlfriend guy,"" he explains, and becomes worried enough about his predicament that he even enlists the help of his gay brother (Andy Samberg) to hook him up with a potential best friend.After some failed dates (one of them, indeed, becomes a predictable-but-funny misunderstanding courtesy of a hilarious supporting role by Thomas Lennon), and on the verge of admitting defeat, Peter finally meets Sydney Fife (Segel) at one of Ferrigno's open houses. Sydney instinctively likes Peter because the buffet is ""classy."" Peter, likewise, admires Sydney's free lifestyle and honest approach to life.If this all sounds like by-the-numbers Apatow/Frat Pack humour, then that's probably because it is. The so-called ""Bromance"" genre has been swiftly accumulating over the past few years, and I Love You, Man goes through many traditional plot devices of the romantic comedy, including the mandatory break-up and make-up sequences. However, it also plays upon a few of these clichés thanks to its gender reversals: The finale, for instance, involves a wedding interruption that's overly familiar for the movie's genre, but it involves the two men making amends with each other rather than the typical outcome we're used to seeing (for instance, Owen Wilson's objection from Wedding Crashers). Of course, you can foresee most of this by the film's halfway point — by then it's already juxtaposing its bromance against typical rom-com procedures — but it's still quite enjoyable.One other note of interest, which seemingly not many critics recognized, is how Rudd and Segel are playing against their established types. Rudd is usually the cynical, effortlessly self-confident jokester; Segel is typically the more shy, awkward and introverted personality. Yet the two actors essentially walk in each other's shoes for this film, and I was surprised, in particular, by how much I liked and believed Rudd's character. He plays Peter not as a complete fool or meek nerd, but as an amiable, nice guy who is just a bit out of the loop socially. His obvious ad-libbing in various scenes — from referring to Sydney with nonsensical nicknames to his curious Jamaican accent — benefits the movie well.Segel, who claims to have been inspired for his performance by Forgetting Sarah Marshall co-star Russell Brand, is admittedly given a bit less to do — his character isn't as fully developed as Peter, nor does he go through as complete a transformation — but he's completely appealing as a balance to Rudd's act, and perfectly embodies the unhinged male spirit. Sydney's life seems to consist of general slacking, playing music, listening to music, eating, having sex, watching TV and so on. He even has his own masturbation station.The supporting cast is impressive. Jon Favreau cameos as a wonderfully arrogant prick; you'll also spot typical Apatow teammates as minor characters. Joe Lo Truglio (the creepy guy from Superbad and school principal in Pineapple Express) is particularly funny as a man with an unfortunate vocal pitch problem.The movie will ultimately appease those who desire vulgar humour, but it's also sweet and affectionate enough to please the weekend multiplex crowds and couples. If I Love You, Man isn't the best comedy of 2009, that's only because so many surprisingly strong contenders have been released this year.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Adequate comedy, a refreshing reminder of friendship's beauty","""I Love You Man"" is about a man with little friends, who needs to find a best friend in a short time to be his best man in his wedding.There are not so many films about male friendships, ""I Love You Man"" is a well made surprise. It centres a man who is about to get married, so the plot is more like a drama about how he is coping with his marriage and his failing real estate career. Humour comes in the form of two friends doing silly things such as jamming their favourite band's song, but I don't really find these scenes funny. To me, what makes this film stand out is the quality of their friendship. How they want each other's company, share their deepest secrets and have fun is amazing. I the modern world where people hardly ever talk face to face anymore, it is a refreshing reminder of how friendship used to be.",,Anonymous,Romance
"""Bromantic Comedy"" successfully fits the formula","We all knew he could do it, but Paul Rudd proves his leading man status in ""I Love You, Man,"" perhaps the first successful Judd Apatow movie not produced by Judd Apatow. Taking actors like Rudd and Jason Segel (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and mixing in R-rated humor and plenty of improv, even the triumvirate of Ivan Reitman, the director of ""Along Came Polly"" and the writer behind the Dr. Doolittle films can put together Apatow's formula and score a good trendy comedy.While the Apatow regulars aren't there, the cast is fluffed with comedians from all corners of the comedic world: JK Simmons (Jason Reitman films), Andy Samberg and Jane Curtin (SNL of two different eras), Jon Favreau (usually in tandem with Vince Vaughn) and even Jay Chandrasehkar (""Broken Lizard"" comedies) makes an appearance. These are all familiar faces, but never before have they all been in the same film. It's true comedic hodge-podge, though the big laughs still come from the improvisational talents of Rudd and Segel.The film is a ""bromantic comedy,"" meaning that instead of a girl coming into the picture and screwing up two best guy friends' relationship, ""I Love You, Man"" is about Peter Klaven, a man whose relationship with a new best guy friend comes in between his seemingly perfect engagement to Zooey (Rashida Jones). Peter, who has always been the perfect boyfriend, has never had a successful friendship with a guy. Even his gay brother Robbie (Samberg) is more masculine and better at talking to straight guys. Rudd perfectly plays up the softie who dares to be a dude and fails miserably, coming up with nonsensical catch phrases and nicknames as he tries to fit in with his new friend, Sydney (Segel).The plot is a fresh twist off an old formula, this time playing into the recent pop culture idea of guys being ""bros."" Rudd perfectly fits this mold: he has always been able to fit whatever role he wants, and now as a leading man, he gets a chance to show off his flexibility. Only he, too, can make saying ""slappin' the bass"" funny the 15th time. Different from his Apatow films, however, ""I Love You, Man"" is more the sentimental type, leaning more toward the romance side of comedy. It stays away from the extreme dirtiness that have given Apatow comedies the ""Apatow"" label. That only makes sense though coming from director John Hamburg, most known for writing the PG-13 ""Meet the Parents"" films and Barry Levin (writer behind ""Dr. Doolittle"" and its sequel).""I Love You, Man"" is the best comedy of 2009 so far, a great date movie in that it amply makes fun of both sexes and has ways of appealing to both as well. It's not without some weak spots, however. Instead of just being weird, for example, the characters acknowledge that they're being weird (Paul Rudd says ""Did I just say that?"" or ""What does that mean?"" a lot) and the humor loses some of its effect. There are also one too many musical tributes to the band Rush. In general, ""I Love You, Man"" is good, but it does expose that behind this decade's best comedies is a simple formula that's bound to get rusty soon.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Funny, Predictable","I went to see this movie not knowing anything about it just because of the cast. It ended up being pretty funny (the whole theater was laughing a lot). I wouldn't go as far to say it was as funny as Old School, but it was also a different type of movie. It's more of an 'akward moment' type of humor than a 'you're just being ridiculous' type of humor. I enjoyed my time watching it and laughed quite a bit, but if you're looking for the funniest movie of the year, this isn't it.Although the cast is great, you don't get to see enough of hilarious people like John Favreau and Jaime Pressly. Had the movie utilized their characters a bit more, I think the movie would definitely be funnier; their interaction was pretty rare and funny.I would spend the money on a movie ticket to see this movie if you like comedies. It's one of the better ones, and if you've seen Paul Blart, you can be sure this one is much funnier.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A comedy for Paul Rudd fans. Suited for anyone else? Ehhh... I dont know. It's an OK comedy, but geared towards guys and their hangups...","It's an OK comedy, but nothing out of the ordinary, although the story about a GUY without any male friends is rather original.Could guys love it? Would girls love this comedy? Depends. If one likes Paul Rudd then this is simply another nobrainer comedy like we know of him. For anyone else it's ok-ish, but perhaps a bit slow and a bit lacking in punch.The good: the dialogues and the (akward) etiquette jokes.The story: Paul Rudd is getting married, but he hasnt got any male friends, which is a fact that starts to worry his fiancee, because men without male friends tend to become clingy husbands.

"I saw an advanced screening of ""I Love You, Man""... It was delightful!","For those of you that have already seen an advanced screening of the movie, you will recognize my title as a spin off a quote in the movie.""I Love You, Man"" works extremely well as a comedy and functions on two main levels. While the trailer and all the advertising sets this up as a great ""bromance"" flick that best buds will go out and see together, the advertising seems to neglect the fact that it can cater to the female market as well with its slight mingling of romantic comedy elements. While it definitely is a buddy movie, there is enough of a romantic element and relationship humor to make it acceptable as a date movie for couples that have been together long enough to know each other's quirks.Paul Rudd and Jason Segel both turn in above average performances and mesh well together, and Rashida Jones does fairly well considering it seems that she has not deviated much from her acting chops on ""The Office"". One of the best cameo/smaller roles definitely goes to Jon Favreau as the guy you hate but also can see yourself being. The supporting cast all turn in very good performances (especially the underrated comedic delivery of J.K. Simmons) and serve as the proper springboard to the rest of the movie.Overall, this is a movie that is well worth your money to go see. The humor is constant, enjoyable, well timed, and not too over the top. Even though it is rated R (and rightfully so for the language) it doesn't feel like your typical dirty comedy that relies on vulgarity for laughs (except in a couple select instances). It doesn't push the comedy too hard and doesn't try to go too far. Because of this, the film gently rolls along unfolding at an enjoyable pace while not rushing any of the elements and seems to roll to a perfectly timed conclusion at 1 hour and 50 minutes. While that is typically long for a comedy, jokes do not seem too stretched out or in-betweens too lulled. I highly encourage everyone to go see this film for a great laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Really, really loved this...","I wasn't expecting too much. I was more like that this is going to be some boring already-seen flick with bad characters. Well, I'm glad that I was wrong. This movie rocked big time.Paul Rudd is simply amazing as always. He simply knows what the good comedy needs, and simply give it. He really constructed the main character to the core and through the whole movie he hanged on to that. Jason Segel also did a good job, so the two of them are the winning combination.I Love You, Man is unique in it's own way. It has not that often plot, some very original gags and is very mature.

The Normal Hollywood Dross,"This film is not funny at all, the acting is poor, the clichés piled on by the bucketful, pure Hollywood dross. I cannot understand why films like this get financed and promoted whilst other far more worthy films get overlooked. Paul Rudd is a poor actor, his character Peter Klaven is the typical Hollywood creation, of a man who is inept but somehow has an attractive woman on his arm etc. The film is uncomfortable to watch because it is so bad and it has absolutely no redeeming moments or scenes.

Entertains thoroughly with only a few minor drawbacks entwined.,"Relationships can be tricky business and cinema has proved itself to be well aware of this all-too-true to life fact. The problem with the transition from reality to the big screen when it comes to relationships however is that it often makes the jump from platonic to sexual, or romantic without so much of a pause for anything otherwise. Yes, over the years there have been a ton of great buddy movies in which two people find a connection not through romantic love, but a bonding that is purely based on companionship; yet not very often do they deal with the sometimes awkward and conflicting areas involved with making the transition from acquaintance to friend that—although obviously not quite as stigmatic as romantic pairings because of typical social convention—sometimes transpires when people, who get desperate, start actively searching for a friend.I Love You, Man, which sets about the better portion of its first half in dealing with this awkward bonding of two guys getting involved in a friendship, or bromance, breaks the mold a little and betrays cinematic convention. Here the guys (or guy) aren't portrayed as easy, cool and flippant about their buddies—rather, the feature makes ease of the friends' romantic interests on the flipside and dishes out the irregularities and pressures often associated with romantic bonding and tags them onto this relationship between two straight guys just looking for a buddy to hang with. The result is a charming, sweet and downright hilarious look at the buddy movie without much pretence to its makeup whatsoever; I Love You, Man even through its apt title establishes that it isn't scared to give a real sense of realism and honesty to its characters and their relationships and that's what makes it work so well.Much of I Love You, Man's ability to reaffirm this constant stream of honesty lies in the performances of its lead stars and to a lesser extent, the minor cast members. Of course, it kind of goes without saying that if you're going to make a romantic comedy that also functions primarily as a buddy movie, you might want to get a few actors with chemistry that can convince the viewer of their bonds and the intertwined conflictions that are likely to ensue as a result of all this emotion and high-spirited discovery that's going on. Thankfully director John Hamburg has two extremely gifted comics who not only know how time a gag perfectly but who can also embody characters who you can actually believe in at the same time; here Paul Rudd and Jason Segel share some great scenes together that are hilarious (many of which come as a result of Rudd's unbearably bumbling and awkward nature contrasted against Segel's straight-guy persona) but most of all, tangible; I Love You, Man is a very funny movie, but it also makes no sacrifice—at least until the final five minutes—to any of the characters' integrity or believability.As far as the romantic subplot of the movie goes which involves Rudd preparing to marry his fiancé played by Rashida Jones (The Office) whilst at the same time trying to sell off Lou Ferrigno's (The Hulk) condo—who, by the way, has some great scenes alongside both Rudd and Segel—being that much of the focus is drawn away from this element, it doesn't work as well as you might expect. Rudd and Jones have lukewarm romantic chemistry, yet there exists a nice rapport between the two that keeps the movie from getting stale. So for something that basically functions as a plot device in order to detail the coming together of the guys, the romance isn't that interesting but at least serves its purpose.For all the good that I Love You, Man does on the basis of its buddy-comedy digressions and breaking-of-the-mold makeup however, there exists a kind of futility about the whole thing that stops it from ever truly taking off. While there are plenty of moments where Hamburg's feature comes off as refreshing and vibrant, there are others where the plot or characters meander in a void of rehashed ideas and jokes that don't flow quite as well as others. With that being said however, such instances as these are far and few between resulting in a movie that entertains thoroughly with only a few minor drawbacks entwined. Indeed, with some great performances, solid laughs throughout and a distinct tone of warmth and honesty throughout, I Love You, Man is definitely worth checking out if buddy movies are your thing, yet still crave something a little different and offbeat.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,Romance

6.5 stars,"I truly love Paul Rudd and Jason Segel, so the two of them together is magical. They didn't disappoint in this one.I enjoy the balance between Peter's healthy masculinity and Sydney's icky bad boy behavior. I don't want to call it toxic masculinity, because he's not aggressive or crude toward women, but he IS crude with men about being a man. Meaning, he never quite grew up. He borders on pick up artist rhetoric mixed with mgtow rhetoric. Guys who like Donald Trump can relate to him in some ways. His mantra is probably ""boys will be boys"".Even though he doesn't say it, that's his attitude.What made this movie funny is the awkwardness from Peter, who always tries to seem clever.

"I liked it, man, but I didn't LOVE it; however, it is definitely a blues-eradicator","Peter (Paul Rudd) is a Los Angeles real estate agent and he's in love with the beautiful Zooey (Rashida Jones). He gets down on his knees at a prime piece of real estate, meant for Zooey's expanding business, and pops open the ring box. She happily accepts. However, as they plan the wedding, it suddenly becomes very apparent that Zooey has several close friends to stand up with her and Peter doesn't even have one close friend to be the best man. Yes, he connects with some of his fencing partners and a few work colleagues but, in general, prefers watching ""Chocolat"" with Zooey and eating popcorn. When a poker game with Zooey's friend's (Jaime Pressley) hubby (Jon Favreau) and gang ends badly, Peter begins to think there is something wrong with him and his inability to ""hang out"" with the male population. But, things can change. At an open house for Lou Ferringo's posh digs, Peter meets investment-counselor Sydney Fife (Jason Segel), who admits he came to the showing only to eat the free food and meet ""divorcees"". Liking Sydney's honesty and sensing that he may be a kindred spirit, Peter begins a friendship with Sydney and starts to ""loosen up"". After all, Sydney lives in a bachelor-pad-garage in Venice, filled with musical instruments for jamming to his favorite band, Rush and he has an offbeat style and humor that is very infectious. Could Sydney be Peter's best chance for a best man? This was a fun film, with great turns by Rudd and Segel. They definitely make the film better than the material, as the script is nowhere near as clever as Rudd's previous winner, Role Models or Segel's Sarah Marshall, either. But, that's not to say it isn't worth the time, it definitely can turn frowns into smiles, as the comedy is broad and universal. The supporting cast is also very nice, as are the California setting, the costumes, and the production values. Likewise good is the upbeat ending. Don't hesitate to see this one, for it is very likable. But, conversely, don't go expecting to be bowled over with laughter, as small grins and twitters are much more likely.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A genuinely funny ""bromantic comedy"": Paul Rudd is the man","It's official: Paul Rudd is the funniest actor working in movies today. He carries with him such a unique screen presence and charisma that it's simply incomparable to any performer today. In recent years, he has become a veteran of the Apatow-style R-rated comedy films, and often manages to steal scenes from the likes of Will Farrell, Steve Carell, Seth Rogen and others. It was only recently, though, that he ""graduated"" from scene-stealing supporting roles to leads, and the results are simply fantastic. Interestingly, his two latest leading roles were in films that were Apatowian in spirit but technically not produced by him, and it is in these films – Role Models and the more recent I Love You, Man, that he really shines.After introducing Paul Rudd, I want to take this opportunity to introduce another term that has come to prominence recently: ""bromance"" or more accurately, the ""bromantic comedy"". This is essentially a film about two guys bonding in which the female characters support from the side and the platonic relationship between the male protagonists is central. In discussions of this sub-genre, many pundits go back and try to label classic films as ""bromances"", from the ""buddy cop"" films of the 80's and 90's and through to Apatow's earlier productions. I think that this discussion is quite ridiculous, because while many of these films may feature ""bromances"", i.e. bonding relationships between two male characters, I Love You, Man is unique in that it is literally a ""bromantic comedy"": the characters meet, have a rocky start, hit it off, enjoy each-other until they become overbearing, have their third-act slump, say that they ""think they should stop seeing each other"" and, of course, end up resolving everything and making up (at a wedding, no less). It's the classic romantic comedy formula, except it depicts the platonic friendship between two male characters, and it does so wonderfully.Paul Rudd gets (and deserves) all the praise in the world for his turn in the film, but one mustn't neglect the other actors, especially his co-star Jason Seel, who was also a background performer in various Apatow films until he rose to prominence thanks to his lead role in last year's Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Paul Rudd had a brilliant supporting role in that film as well, and I think it's interesting to note the role reversal these two actors pull off this time around. In Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Segel played a neurotic, shy, awkward wreck of a man while Rudd played a laid-back, pot-smoking surfer dude; this time around, Rudd is the neurotic, shy awkward wreck while Segel is the laid-back, easy-going ""living life"" dude. I think it's a testament to these actors' talents that they can do both, and it's perfect proof that they aren't one-note as they are often accused of being.Eventually, as it is with other recent similarly-styled films such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Knocked Up, the plot is quite irrelevant and what is important are the characters, and even more so, the comedy. And this film doesn't disappoint in that department; the banter between the characters is absolutely hilarious, their often ad-libbed gags are brilliant, and I don't think I've ever seen anyone play awkward quite as well as Rudd in this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Original hilarity,"I just can't think of any movie like I Love You, Man. This story of a guy in search of a best man is wonderful. It destroys the clichés of being the sports-loving, beer guzzling guy and explores the relationships some guys have with each other while being completely hilarious from beginning to end, as well as highlighting the importance of the protagonist's relationship with his bride-to-be. And aside from all the great but ridiculous jokes, it manages to maintain a huge heart. I Love You, Man is basically the inverse of the ""chick flick.""

Rush fans of the world unite!,"Movies filled with swearing and vulgarity do not humor me as much as they used to.

Plus he goes out on ""man dates."" Really??!!? Are men becoming women? What would John Wayne say about this? It's embarrassing. But still there are great moments of serious laughter in this movie. The Jon Favreau-Jaime Presley relationship was a bit of comedic backbone this needed, as well as the Thomas Lennon character (maybe funnier than Rudd & Segel.) Unfortunately it didn't have enough backbone. And the whole ""bromance"" thing? Not appealing. I don't understand why this has such a high IMDb rating. Funny yes but also awkward, girlie and stupid. A few elements of this will allow me to consider watching it again someday... but I would only recommend it for Rush or Lieutenant Jim Dangle fans.6.1 / 10 stars--Zoooma, a Kat Pirate Screener",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Hilarious Movie! A Must Watch!,Classic Paul Rudd - The funniest movie I've ever seen.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Review of ""I Love You, Man""","In Jon Hamburg's ""I Love You, Man"", he successfully creates a hilarious and delightfully relatable bromantic comedy. ""I Love You, Man"" tells the story of Peter Klaven (Rudd), a man who has just proposed to his girlfriend and finds himself in a bit of a predicament. He feels that, throughout his life, he has never had an individual that he could call his best friend, so he takes it upon himself to find one. After many failed attempts at finding a guy to call his pal, he gives up and ends up meeting Sydney Fife (Segel). Hilarity ensues. Now, I'm gonna' start off by saying that when Paul Rudd and Jason Segel first start to hang out with one another, it is one of the most awkward friendships I've ever seen. It's still funny, but hard to watch at times. After this awkward phase though, the chemistry between Rudd and Segel really starts to shine, and then the laughs begin to roll in. At this point, the writing really starts to pick up as well. Also, the band ""Rush"" was used as a plot device for the film - I found this to be extremely unique and it was awesome to see Rudd and Segel's characters bond over their music. With a solid script, unforgettable chemistry between it's leads, and a memorable premise, ""I Love You, Man"" makes for an amazing comedy that I won't soon forget.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"'I Loved It, Man'","Next to being a delightfully refreshing and entertaining comedy John Hamburg's 'I Love You, Man' also takes a look at gender role in today's society and how friendship between two men and two women may look different on the surface but there is a strong resemblance on a deeper level. Like Peter tells Sydney about his intimate secrets and concerns which is also what Zooey does with her friends. Basically, it shows that in a good friendship (whether it's between men or women), friends are there for each other, they comfortably share secrets and they try to help each other out with their concerns.The jokes in 'I Love You, Man' work effectively. It's not fully loaded with vulgarity but instead the humour is well-balanced. Hamburg and Levin's writing deserves mention as they introduce a novel, unconventional premise and tell an amusing story with some of the funniest lines.The cast is superb. Rudd shares a great chemistry with both Segel and Jones. He has previously worked with Rudd and it's quite obvious that they are comfortable working with each other. Both play their parts to the T. Rashida Jones is a fresh choice and she is totally charming. Jane Curtin and J.K. Simmons only contribute to the list of hilarious supporting cast. Jaime Pressly stands out.'I Love You, Man' will be compared to Apatow's films like 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', 'Knocked Up' etc mainly because of Rudd and Segel. However, I actually preferred this movie to those Apatow films (which I wouldn't watch more than once). 'I Love You, Man' is a movie I wouldn't mind revisiting and watching again with friends.",,Anonymous,Romance
Not As Good As Role Models,"It was refreshing to see such an honest portrayal of how close the rituals of friendship and dating can be. The movie also admits that being the cool loner doesn't always work out in real life. Regardless of your gender, you can probably relate to Paul Klaven's experience, especially if you've ever moved to a new town as an adult.There were moments of fart/vomit/balls comedy that seemed just plain out of place with the rest of the movie, which is particularly ironic in a comedy that explores a less traditional version of masculine behavioror maybe these were supposed to show that it was an acceptably male comedy? At any rate, these moments were distracting in their gratuitousness, but few and far between.The guys in the theater seemed to enjoy the movie quite a bit. I enjoyed it to a more limited degree. I'm sorry to say this, but Jason Segel isn't half the comic actor that Paul Rudd is, and that drags the movie down. I'm only sorry to say it because Segel can play the loser-y schlub so effectively you actually do feel sorry for him, even if he was less loser-y in this movie. But he really didn't make me laugh. Rashida Jones, too, did all right but has never struck me as a fantastic comedienne.The non-snarky version of Paul Rudd, on the other hand, is just adorable, and that is really what carries this movie (at least for female viewers). Those pretty green eyes, that sweet smile, that alabaster skin! Seriously, at points I wasn't sure whether I was ogling him or merely admiring his skin care routine.The supporting cast, too, is great. Andy Samburg is quite funny as Paul's gay brother Robbie, who understands men better than his straight brother. Jaime Pressley (one of my favorites) and Jon Favreau have great comic chemistry as married couple who are just plain awful. J.K. Simmons and Jane Curtain are vastly underutilized as Paul's parents.I think men and women alike can enjoy this movie, though women might be a bit put off by touches like the utterly superficial and cliché desperate friend, Hailie, though actress Sarah Burns does her best. This movie, like most in the Apatow juggernaut, is still working its way towards making female characters equally funny and likable as male charactersbut you get the sense that it's trying, at least.Overall, this movie is a B/B-. Mostly, It was in need of editing. Comedies need to move at a pretty quick pace, and this one dragged a bit. It's definitely amusing, but not nearly as funny as ""Role Models"" was, at least in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I Love You, Man was a reasonably amusing comedy for me","Let me admit up front right now that during some of the middle section of this movie, I partly fell asleep. So it's possible I felt a little underwhelmed watching I Love You, Man. That said, while I felt some of the scenes might have been underplayed and the pace wasn't as up as I'd like it to be, there were plenty of funny lines and scenes that I got reasonably entertained during most of what I managed to see. Stars Paul Rudd and Jason Segel are perfect together as a groom and his potential best man so they alone make the movie worth seeing. It's just that not enough seemed to be done to make the rest of the cast like Andy Samberg, Jane Curtin, J.K. Simmons, Jaime Pressly, and Jon Favreau really stand out though each have their moments. And leading lady Rashida Jones does well with what she has. So on that cautious note, I Love You, Man is at least worth a look.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The movie was just freaking awesome. I don't see a film being as funny as this for a long time.

A romantic comedy with two straight guys,"This is a romantic comedy with two straight guys. And it constantly has those romantic comedy fights, the relationship fights. Peter Klaven(Paul Rudd)is engaged to Zooey Rice(Rashida Jones) but the problem is Peter Klaven is a big dork and since he is such a dork, he don't have any male friends or a male friend and he needs one for his best man. Peter seeks the advice of his younger, gay brother Robbie(Andy Samberg) and he tells Peter how it is, how when he gets married he is going to blow off everyone and wrap his life around the girl he is married to. Soon Peter meets Sydney Fife(Jason Segel) and forms a friendship. I found Sydney Fife to be a bit obnoxious but funny since he does and says stuff most people would back off from doing even if they sometimes want to, but Sydney actually does it. Most of the comedy in this is a cute comedy, but nothing really hysterical. It's a solid comedy but it just doesn't reach the level where you have to see it. This is a happy movie that is a good comedy to see as a group and even on a date.7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wait until DVD and then wait some more.,"Saw this tonight. Thank god I didn't have to pay for the tickets.It's basically about a guy who has so little imagination they he simply does whats expected of him without realizing he's doing it. But just before his wedding he overhears himself being talked about in a negative way (which he's not used to) because he has no male friends. So he decides to do something about it. The solution being to go out on ""Dates"" with perspective best friends in order to find a best man for his wedding. After a couple of disasters (including the predicable gay date) he meets another guy who is avoiding commitment and they embark on forming a friendship which predictably, ends up annoying his fiancé, etc etc. And they all live happily ever after.This could have been so much better. The characters felt like they had been given the 'B' script lines. The jokes were so obvious that by the time they got to the punch lines it was not longer funny. By the time it was half way through the clumsy and silly male banter dialog had become repetitive and painful.Story wise it could have been so much better and even made the film funnier if it was less predictable. The premise had some possibilities but was let down by the lack of imagination.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Man-dated Mischief,"It's a ""man-date""! Yes, it's a phenomenon I know little about: Men who need friends go on ""man-dates."" I Love You, Man is a Judd Apatow-type comedy about an engaged real estate salesman Peter Klaven (Paul Ruddan Apatow grad), who, as a typical ""girlfriend guy,"" needs to make male friends, especially because he knows no one to be his best man. The estimable director Patrice Leconte got to a similar subject in My Best Friend but with fewer laughs but a smoother take all around as befitting the French.Writer/director John Hamburg's little comedy of manners has the usual scatological, penis jokes, but mostly in the beginning to establish its cred as a funny albeit raunchy guy (and chick) flick. Sometimes the director shows his lack of comedic deftness, for instance, when new buddy ""investor"" Sydney (Jason Segel) lets his dog poop three times, the first not very funny, much less two more times without pickling it upbut, hey, just seeing it happen is tasteless and boring enough.I Love You, Man even has its Seth Rogen slacker in Segel, who is more laid-back than Rogen but less funny. The combination of Rudd and Segel is comically successful, an apples-and-oranges act that plays authentic, partly because their characters are honest guys with typical issues that they unusually talk about. For example, Rudd's fiancé, Zooey (Rashida Jones) apparently doesn't like oral sex; Segel moves that piece of privacy with a very public toast and through much of the movie, mostly as a motif to parse Rudd's relationship with his fiancé.Because deconstructing male friendships is mostly unchartered territory for movies (women have owned the chick- bonding theme forever), Hamburg does an admirable job playing with the many variations of male bonding. Most telling is the juxtaposition of girlfriends sharing all and males sharing little and the attendant indignation on the part of the ladies when the men start serious bonding.Hamburg does well enough with other characters, such as bickering couple Barry (Jon Favreau) and Jaime Pressly) and JK Simmons' earthy dad. Overall, I Love You, Man is a welcome addition to the current spate of light adult fare that opens up the possibility of further male-psyche exploration. It's wild territory and potentially more satirical than this movie.",,Anonymous,Romance
it was alright,"So I decided to watch this movie because I was bored. The movie was alright, at first I didn't really like it and thought the jokes were lame and unfunny but towards the end, the movie gets really good. The movie had its funny points, quite a few of them. Overall though the movie just presents several awkward points. If you are anything like me then it could pose a problem. It just seemed awkward how easily Peter met and became such close friends. It seemed too unrealistic. While watching the movie I was thinking that there was gonna be a twist about Sydney like he is gay or a bad person, but he ended up being a great person. I did really enjoy the movie at the end because I like the cast that they had. They just tried to use the awkward moments for comedy, which did work but its just so weird. I found funny that Sydney's dog was named after a former Egyptian President because he claimed to look a like, that was hilarious. I also liked when he was walking his dog on the boardwalk then it would leave crap and people stepped in it and reacted. That was funny I found it creepy that Peter was just finding guys so they can be his best man at a wedding. It just seemed odd how he was using Sydney at first. It also seemed unrealistic how Sydney acted. I mean, he didn't really ever get mad at Peter. Overall, it was pretty decent!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Relies On Chemistry Between Segel and Rudd,"""I love you man""Plot In A Paragraph: Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) is delighted when his girlfriend Zooey (Rashinda Jones) accepts his marriage proposal, however he his horrified to hear her friends calling him ""Friendless"" upon realising he doesn't actually have any close friends, he goes on a series of man-dates to find a Best Man for his wedding. This proves disastrous until a chance meeting with Sydney (Jason Segel)I felt this movie took a while to get going, and that was mainly due to the fact that it took about thirty minutes for Segel's character to be introduced. There was one genuine laugh out loud moment prior to his first appearance. The movie picks up massively once his character is introduced, and the laughs come thicker and faster.The movie relies heavily on the chemistry between the two actors, and I'm surprised that as if yet they have not worked together again. Whilst Rashinda Jones is very attractive, I found her acting awkward and unconvincing. J.K Simmons was a lot of fun as Rudd's dad as was Jamie Presly as Jones's best friend. The same can not be said for Jon Favareu. I' a fan of his, but I have never seen him so annoying.Overall it's a predictable silly movie, but I enjoyed a lot of it, especially once Segel came in to it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I think the people who played the characters were perfect for this story. What ever personality you have, you could identify with one of the characters. One being passive and the other being out-going. It has some very comical phrases and logic in it that are things that you could repeat as comical classic phrases.

"Outstanding Cast and Screenplay Made Me Fall in Love With 'I Love You, Man'","It's been a while since we've had a movie from John Hamburg. His last creation was the hit Along Came Polly, which, thanks to Ben Stiller, pretty much launched his career as a writer/director/producer. So 5 years after the release of Polly, we have I Love You, Man, a movie about a guy who's getting married and goes on a series of ""man-dates"" to find a best man for his wedding. Before I saw this, I researched a lot about it. First I noticed it was co-written/directed/produced by John Hamburg, as I mentioned earlier in the review. This shocked me a bit, since similar Forgetting Sarah Marshall was directed by Nicholas Stoller. It also starred Jason Segel, so I was expecting him to write the screenplay. But instead, Hamburg and Larry Levin (who also co-wrote Dr. Dolittle and wrote Dr. Dolittle 2) took on the challenge together. Disappointing since I loved Sarah Marshall so much. But I'm not counting out Hamburg just yet. He did nail the feel that he and Levin intended the movie to have, that ""bromantic"" parody which had me cracking up at scenes that I wasn't even supposed to be laughing at. The jokes could've been hit-and-miss, but Hamburg made sure that they were spaced out and spoke awesomely. Paul Rudd plays realtor Peter, a friendless but lovable geek who needs to find a best man for his wedding with Zooey (played by a gorgeous and side-splitting Rashida Jones). At an open house for Lou Ferrigno (who's a surprising gem), he stumbles upon Sydney (Jason Segel), a careless, go-with-the-flow kind of guy who refuses to grow up. The two hit it off and soon Sydney's RSVP'd for Peter's wedding. Rudd and Segel have both had their fair share of hits, both sleeper and those that have topped the charts. Segel's had Knocked Up and Forgetting Sarah Marshall, both of which Rudd starred in, and let's also not forget his recurring role as Marshall on the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother. Rudd has had classics thanks to Judd Apatow like The 40-Year Old Virgin and Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story as well as loners like Role Models and The Ten. Together, the duo is unstoppable. Rudd's quiet awkwardness and Segel's loudmouth obnoxiousness blend together to make a pitch- perfect comedy of epic proportions. I Love You, Man is a feel-good, happy movie that desperately doesn't want to be. Whenever there's a moment where that statement can be expressed, the ""F"" word is dropped and kills the mood entirely. There's not as much cursing as in Observe and Report, and it's not quite as vulgar as Forgetting Sarah Marshall (although there was a pretty gross sight gag) were, yet Love You, Man still holds the 'R' rating. It had to be, though, in the tradition of comedies such as this one. With only a 'PG-13' rating, John Hamburg might not have achieved his goal. We'll remember I Love You, Man as one of the best comedies of our time. It's full of zingy one-liners like ""I will see you there, or I will see you at another time!"" ""Okay, that was confusing, will you be there or not?"". Other roles besides those of Rudd, Segel and Jones are filled brilliantly by Jamie Pressly, Jon Favreau and Andy Samberg. And there's this one hilarious part with Thomas Lennon whereyou know what? Go see it for yourself. I love this movie, man.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A funny and heart-warming buddy comedy, that's not for everyone","Peter is a successful real estate agent (Rudd) has found the perfect fiancé. But there's only one thing missing from his life: a guy friend. He's always been a good with women, but horrible with men (and he doesn't have homophobia.) Then he meets Sydney (Segal) at his open house. Sydney puts all the fun back into Peter's life from jam sessions to eating fish tacos. Sadly when Sydney complicates thins between Peter and his fiancé, their friendship breaks apart and the bond they once had is over. However both men realize soon, that they both miss hanging out and learn that friendship is like marriage, and it takes hard work to really connect with each other. A lot of this movie actually works as a comedic and heartfelt buddy comedy. Jason Segal and Paul Rudd (who I really hope won't be a stranger soon) have perfect chemistry, and they should star in every buddy comedy together. This is raunchy, profane, and grossed out but it's actually a great movie about respect, communicating, and being true to not only yourself but to your friends as well. Not many R rated movies are as heartfelt as this anymore, so if you have a best friend and if you're over 16 go out and take a lesson from this movie apart from the content. The real reason why this movie is rated R is because of the really strong language. If they got rid of that and a bit of the sexual slangs, and jokes then it would have been more enjoyable for everyone. Some of the comedy in this movie did seem to be pretty forced and gross out, but yet it's a buddy comedy so you can expect that kind of stuff in a movie like this. I Love You Man is a delightfully funny Bromantic comedy for teenage boys or girls. It could also open up a conversation with your best friend of why Sydney is a good friend, and if you think that your friends are like him. If you aren't a fan of crude and gross out humour or hearing the F Word over 50 times, you will probably want to see another movie. If not, this is on your list.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Seriously, a 7.2","Watched this movie this evening. It is seriously over-rated. There are so many better movies of better quality than this. Everyone in the film, I believe, used the ""F"" word at least once, which is very unrealistic for professionals in the business setting... or should be. Everyone. including the 90+ year old man and the young professional women, had a foul mouth, talking vulgar about the couple's sex life. Could have been a much better movie if it was cleaned up... a lot. I was highly disappointed. Don't waste your time unless you have nothing better to do and don't mind wasting the time out of your life. I am not a better person for watching this, not a happier person; just feel robbed of my evening.

Another Apatow episode about growing up--sort of,"Since the Apatow comedies are all about male bonding, it makes sense to have a movie that approaches that topic head on. That's what 'I Love You, Man' is. And as the bonding couple, who better than Mr. Cuddly, Paul Rudd, and Mr. Big Sweet Neurotic Baby, Jasen Segel (who happen to have clicked together since a few years ago, and work so smoothly their hardest acting job was not to seem like old friends from the first scene) . Apatow and some of the key members of his creative team come out of TV and it's best to see the feature films as like extended TV series episodes. This is a good one, but it's still more an episode than a feature film. Why? Because you can best appreciate it if you know all the other films and TV that fed into it.""Apatow"" is a rule of thumb term: different writers and directors are involved, but Judd produced '40 Year Old Virgin,' 'Knocked Up,' 'Superbad,' 'Walk Hard,' 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' and 'Pineapple Express.' (I forgot 'Drillbit Taylor'; it might be best to do so.) It's funny, the fertile ground all these popular movies seems to come from is two TV series that basically flopped, or at least they were canceled after 17 or 18 episodes: 'Freaks and Geeks' and 'Undeclared.' Viewers of these will know Jason Segel as an embarrassingly obsessive boyfriend; and then he got practically a whole movie to himself in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' as a boyfriend who can't--forget his girlfriend, that is.I don't really think any of these movies are better than 'Freaks and Geeks' or 'Undelcared,' which were about high-schoolers and first-year college kids, respectively. Both are rich in turn-of-the-21st-century pop cultural implication because they're episodic ensemble pieces, as TV can be. A movie must highlight a few characters for a longer time, and the attention can be tough on the Apatow stable's style, and weaken the prevailing focus on types and generational behavior. Obviously the advantage accrued to the Apatow outlook in full length feature films like '40 Year Old Virgin' and 'Superbad' is the chance for more public, big-screen vulgarity and sexual explicitness. It gave them a chance to express what it is for boys to be boys and embrace the culture's greater willingness to talk dirty, like the guys in Kevin Smith's movies.Like Seth Rogen, who even as a youngster in the making of 'Freaks,' contributed to episodes, and more to 'Undecared' and most to 'Superbad,' Jason also writes. He contributed music to 'Freaks and Geeks' and his own character in the series, Nick Andopolis, must owe much to his own conception; it flows into his 'Sarah Marshall' character, and he wrote 'Sarah Marshall.' In 'I Love You, Man,' Jason's character, Sydney Fife, isn't wildly neurotic, stalking his girlfriend and about to burst into tears (or song) at the drop of a hat, as before. This time, he's more cool. He's super cool, for Peter Kleven, Paul Rudd's character, because he's available for ""bromance,"" defined in The Urban Dictionary as ""the complicated love and affection shared by two straight males.""Peter's getting married, it's time to find a best man and he realizes he has dated women and not spent much time with guys. He has no real male friends. At others' suggestion, he starts looking for them. For a while the movie provides vignettes of bad ""man dates,"" including one where the date is gay, and kisses Peter. In this Peter's counseled by his almost ridiculously confident and macho gay brother, Robbie (Andy Samberg). The Apatow guys are ready to be gay-friendly, and the issue has to come up here, when men are going to love each other, but they're not ready to take any chances. To secure Robbie's straight-friendliness, his macho dad (the solidly male J.K. Simmons) even declares Robbie's his ""best friend."" Peter sells real estate and while doing an open house for a Lou Ferrigno mansion (don't ask) Sydney appears, and the bonding begins. Sydney is available because he doesn't have a girlfriend. He's just a grown up boy, with his dog whose poop he doesn't clean up, his slob clothes, and his man cell with its masturbation chair. He's a guy-guy, but he can talk about stuff. He's direct and honest and demands that of Peter, which Peter finds attractive. So, they bond. Ostensibly Peter was just looking for a best man. But he finds out he's open to the rewards and challenges of bromance. Trouble is, his fiancée inevitably finds this a bit invasive. Man love takes time away from man-woman love.Trouble comes when Sydney gives a toast at a pre-wedding family dinner where he's a bit too explicit in revealing his knowledge about a shortcoming in the sex between Peter and his fiancée, Zooey (Rashida Jones).Actually the best parts of 'I Love You, Man,' are where Peter struggles for a language of camaraderie when talking to Sydney, turning out silly abbreviations and nicknames for his new pal. Rudd manages to be both unguarded and smooth. Rudd hasn't always played such an adorable character as he does here. In truth I don't know where Paul Rudd came from (TV, somewhere), but he is universally beloved. Rudd's a nice-looking, sweet guy, sweet almost to the point of sappiness. But he can also be mean and manic: see his anti-Starbucks rant on YouTube. I can imagine him playing Neil LaBute.'I Love You, Man' is more like a chick flick than they've done before--but a chick flick where the guys do the chick thing of sharing secrets and emotions. This being the case, it's a bit (but only a bit) less vulgar and sophomoric than other comedies in the series, and the language is toned down. But it still works and it's fun. Segal and Rudd work so well together you may not realize how much fun till later.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A movie for Paul Rudd fans.,"I saw this movie, and it was way better than I thought. It wasn't one of those completely idiotic movies. It was funny, it had heart, and it was a great movie. One piece of advice though, DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE IT! It may have been a heartfelt movie, but it was a crude movie. The beginning had some crude parts that were not necessary. Then the language was uncalled for. Aside from that, the movie definitely made me laugh. Jason Segel and Paul Rudd had great chemistry together. They were goofy and could tell they had fun making this movie. Other funny characters, which will come as no surprise, were Thomas Lennon and Jon Favreau.

"Flat, cliché-ridden, not very funny or amusing","This movie is a wasted opportunity. Although it tries to be a good nature comedy exploring the difficulties men can have in finding and maintaining true friendships, the pace is uneven and flat, the dialog is mostly dull, the scarce jokes are not very funny, the situations are uninspired and unrealistic, and the characters are bland and shallow.SNL alumni Andy Samberg and Jane Curtin and legendary muscleman Lou Ferrigno could have added plenty of laughter and spice but they only have a couple of lines and nothing much to do. And it is the same for the rest of the cast, with the exception of Paul Rudd and Jason Siegel who tried their best despite their contrived and sometimes idiotic lines.This is a contrived, unoriginal, poorly edited, boring affair full of recycled clichés, badly written and ineptly directed.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Slight but very tasty comedic comfort food,"I Love You, Man signals the arrival of a great thing - Paul Rudd, leading man. Yes, there was Role Models, but he was sharing the load and splitting screen time with Seann William Scott in that one, here, it's all Rudd, all the time; he's the focus of virtually every scene and every moment. This is a great thing.Paul Rudd is the ideal avatar for modern comedy, a nearly perfect average of every character type; droll and sarcastic but not a jerk, awkward and self-deprecating but not a loser, comfortably profane but without seeming like something's missing when he's not swearing, good looking but not insultingly so, and with a line delivery and comic timing that hits every bullseye a script offers him. I was waiting for Judd Apatow to center a project around him but it seems that John Hamburg, who has vindicated himself for the execrable Along Came Polly, beat him to the punch.Paul Rudd is Peter (the most common protagonist name after Jack?), who is marrying Zooey. But Peter has no male friends and no best man, so he has to step outside his comfort zone of relationships with women and try to meet and befriend a dude. Enter the supernaturally easygoing Sydney, played by Jason Segel doing the exact opposite of his depressed, high- strung Forgetting Sarah Marshall character, and we watch their friendship bloom.Peter and Zooey's romance is a constant, not really focused on, with the movie as a whole being a twist on the generic romantic comedy, refocusing all the tropes of the genre - the cute initial meeting, the tentative bonding, the blissful montage, the tearful fight, the joyous reunion, and so on - from romance to platonic male friendship. It's simple but it works completely, thanks largely to the brilliant cast. Paul Rudd - the perfect awkward everyman. Jason Segel - hilarious. Rashida Jones as Zooey - hilarious and adorable. With the likes of J.K. Simmons, Andy Samberg, Jaime Pressly, Jon Favreau, and Rob Huebel filling out the edges and smaller characters, this is an A+ comedy role call.It's definitely a post-Apatow comedy, meaning that it's R-rated, profane, raunchy, and stuffed with frank sexual dialogue, but it does it right, letting the comedy flow naturally from characters that happen to be profane rather than trying to replace humorous interactions with profanity and sex. I thought Zack & Miri Make a Porno was mildly funny, but it was trying so, so hard to be offensive that I actually cringed a couple times at how juvenile it seemed; in contrast I Love You, Man is mellow and easygoing and never has to force the issue that it's funny.The movie is also impressive for all the cliché romantic comedy things it doesn't do: At no point is there a moronic misunderstanding that would be cleared up if only the characters would speak to one another. No one ever thinks someone is cheating on anyone else. Neither men or women are presented as smarter or dumber or prissier or lazier than the other. Sydney never even faces comeuppance for his brazen sexual hedonism! Sure, there's conflict and characters fight, but none of it is ever cheap or manipulative, the conflicts, while comic and heightened, actually resemble things that, get this, real people might fight about! It's like they made a big list of the things I hate about 97% of romantic comedies and carefully didn't do any of them.I hate to sound like a gushing Paul Rudd fanboy, but I have embarrassingly little critique to offer to I Love You, Man. It's a very slight movie with a featherweight narrative, there's nothing deep or remotely innovative about the experience and it won't inspire any knockoffs because there's nothing identifiably unique about it to knock off, but it hits all the right notes, never lags, and has a superb cast that to a man (and woman) know their way around a punchline. It's extremely funny comedic comfort food and I recommend it to all non- buzzkills.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"abounds with hilarious social observations and funny, yet authentic dialogue","""I Love You, Man"" is a hilarious comedy composed of all too familiar elements. However, instead of focusing on a conventional inter-gender relationship, it deals with male bonding complete with its challenges and rewards. Paul Rudd stars as Peter Klaven, a real estate agent who is about to marry soon. When he realizes he doesn't have any real friend to be his best man during the wedding, he starts his quest for platonic man-love. After many failed endevours, he meets Sydney Fife (Jason Segel) who happens to have the perfect traits to be his friend for life. This is not a Judd Apatow movie, but on the whole it feels like one. Witer/director John Hamburg and co-writer Larry Levine combine physical humour with hilarious social observations and funny, yet authentic dialogue. They don't forget to spice the flick with some pop-culture references which involve Hulk from the TV series, Lou Ferringo and the adoration of both characters for prog-rock legends Rush (!). Besides, the movie is very well paced delivering just enough laughs that are perfectly grounded in reality and so immensely relatable. ""I Love You, Man"" can also be characterized by means of its amazing central performances. Paul Rudd approaches anxiety and social awkwardness with deadpan delivery, while Jason Segel strikes the right mark with his cool, goofy and irresistibly charismatic character without ever being too silly or cartoonish.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not impressed,"I watched a good chunk of this movie, haven't quite finished it yet. So, I guess I am finding it very hard to relate to any of it. The basic premise that having even a single good friend sometimes can be a challenge is a realistic one and one that may be interesting to write or talk about. However, I just did not get into the way that this particular movie goes about presenting the premise and the resolution. There just seemed to be a lot of cliché talk, some vulgarities and whatnot, and characters that had too little screen time and too few meaningful lines to really make an impression. Paul Rudd can sometimes be an engaging lead but he wasn't to me in this one. There was a certain air of fakeness that went with the whole movie, which I didn't appreciate; the most ""honest"" part of the movie was the somewhat profane language. All in all, I was left unimpressed.""Role models"", which is kind of similar seemed like a much better movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"You can't help but fall for 'I Love You, Man'","In a time filled with dark and cynical comedies, 'I Love You, Man' is a pleasant and satisfying breath of fresh air. It is one of those few romantic comedies nowadays with an equal balance of humor and sweetness. The sincerity of the actors and dialogue, which is witty, sometimes hilarious but never over-the-top or cheesy, gives this movie an undeniable appeal that is absent from so many of the comedies churned out by Hollywood.Part of that appeal comes from the lead actor. Of course, I'm talking about the always lovable Paul Rudd. He makes the audience really cheer for his character and turns what could have been a one-dimensional stereotype into someone that feels genuine and real. With excellent comic timing, he gives Peter Claven a sort of almost puppy-dog innocence and an every-guy feel. Despite his obvious social awkwardness, he is the guy that you'd want to have a beer with or just hang out with after work. Paul Rudd delivers his lines so well, with such naturalness, that I wondered how much of it was actually scripted and how much had been improvised or reflected his real personality.It also helps that he has great chemistry with Jason Segal and Rashida Jones. As a carefree yet somewhat lazy investor, Jason Segal makes his character fun to watch and it's no surprise that he and Paul Rudd really do seem like the perfect friends. Paul Rudd's chemistry with Rashida Jones helps make the few lines that could have sounded sappy or cheesy seem totally natural. Unlike in many rom-coms, you actually want their relationship to work out. This is also the result of the script, which fleshed out Zooey (Rashida Jones's character) as much as it fleshed out any of the male characters. She does not feel at all clichéd.I must also mention the rest of the terrific supporting cast, which includes J.K. Simmons, Andy Samberg, Jon Favreau and Jamie Pressly, among others. Though none of them got nearly as much screen time as the three main actors, they all had their moments and did a great job with their characters, which were quirky but believable.Like any good comedy, I Love You, Man had a script that had both laughs and heart. Though it was not 'rolling-in-the-aisle' funny, there were definitely plenty of laugh-out loud moments to keep the audience's attention. But what is perhaps even more special, the story is genuinely touching. The relationships between the characters are well-developed, especially the friendship between Peter and Sydney. The message about being honest and being yourself is well-delivered and never comes off as preachy. At the end, it leaves you feeling warm and optimistic, like any good comedy should.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I love you, man. I love you, woman.","Paul Rudd and Rashida Jones make this film endearingly work. It is funny, it is sad, and it bring out the ironies of relationships.Although the film contains stereotypes, which are not necessarily true, it makes one seriously think about homophobia, relationships with men, and relationships with women. Overall, I think that the film conveys the vital importance of having an open heart and and an open mind.The film clearly conveys the vital importance of loving one's fellow man and woman. Paul Rudd and Rashida Jones really come through in effectively conveying this message. Like Sean Penn, Hollywood seems to be getting this message, and positively conveying it to the world.Hate only brings more hate, but love brings a love that continues to help us to grow and grow as civilized human beings. Like ""Milk"", this film is a must-see, and I rank it a 10 out of 10.Since President Obama has been elected President of the United States, I have seen God's true message of love (that we should love one another) accurately portrayed. We should strive to love, not hate, one another. This film is a strong bearer of this message, and I hope to see more films bearing such an empowering message. See this film with someone you love and, maybe, with someone you don't. Then, just revel in the power of love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Are people like that?,"Is this a comedy with an agenda? Are families and people like that? If this is true, society is really decadent.This movie is an attack to the senses and good taste. More than a romantic comedy, ILYM is a way to push on us a porno/gay lifestyle.Do girls talk freely and publicly about oral sex with all their friends? Does a father proudly embraces the gay lifestyle of a son and comment on the sex activities of this son at a dinner table? Do people use the word f**** all the time? Are all hetero men attracted to gay men?Do we have to be bombarded by these things all the time? Can't people do a clean comedy anymore?

The Rebirth Of Platonic Love Between Men!,"The United States, in general, is quite a homophobic country. Men are expected to have platonic feelings of love only for immediate family members, such as parents, grandparents, siblings and their own offspring. Sharing one's nonsexual feelings of love outside this tiny world is basically considered taboo. In other cultures this is certainly not the case, something I had the good fortune to experience first hand!I Love You, Man does a superb job of comparing and contrasting heterosexual women's emotionally rich, same-sex friendships with heterosexual men's typically barren, same-sex friendships. It exposes the hypocrisy that it's okay for women to hug and be emotionally close and talk in graphic details about their sex lives amongst themselves, but NOT for a man to do the same exact thing!What a refreshing and insightful film! This brilliant story also compares male homosexual and heterosexual same-sex relationships and on the surface, at least, they are indistinguishable! This might be news to some people - but all well-adjusted human beings have a yearning for emotionally rewarding relationships! And, one person can not fulfill ALL your emotional needs! It's really that simple!Thank you Hollywood for taking such a risk in making such a profound film with a great sense of humor! It shows you believe a certain segment of the American public is mature enough to want to explore the meaning of platonic love between men!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Paul Rudd as a leading man, at last!","While my search for a crystal ball as of yet still remains fruitless, I can't predict the future with hand-in-the-fire, steady-handed certainty and confidence, but I will tell you there's a 95% chance I'll declare this the most complete and consistently funny comedy of 2009 when the time for best-of lists rolls around the corner.Before people get annoyed with the term ( too late?), ILYM is a ""bromance""; the non-sexual love, well friendship, story between two men. Realtor Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) is struck by a weird realization after proposing to his girlfriend Zooey (Rashida Jones): he's never had a best friend. He's never even had close male friends. He meets Sidney Fife (Jason Segel) at an open house and they hit it off immediately. Zooey begins to worry about the closeness and time consumption of the fellas' friendship and Peter's never learned how to talk or act around male friends. He constantly tries to force cool 'slang' into his vocabulary (he nicknames Sidney ""City Slicher"", in an unfortunate burst of spontaneity) and they jam together in a garage. Peter struggles to balance his new-found lost adolescence and his sense of responsibility in the weeks before his marriage.I Love You, Man is 2009's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and proves the upward arch of mainstream comedy quality since ""the 40-year old virgin"", comedies with heart are taking over from misogynistic, gratuitously violent and inappropriately disgusting or dirty comedies.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's so different to me,"I don't consider this a comedy, and I said the same thing after ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". I think we need a new word for these movies because they're not really dramas and I laughed a lot, but they're just not comedies. For the record I liked this a lot more that FSM, which I thought was alternately brilliant and dull depending on the scene. This movie has a really steady pace and I really enjoyed it. I thought while watching it, ""This movie is just like a hug."" Seriously it's just a really sweet movie about nice people who are friends and want to be decent to each other and help each other out, except for the one guy (played by Jon Favreau) but he was even cool.I liked everyone in it. But the movie is mostly about Paul Rudd and Jason Segel who are a great duo. I actually thought that it would be nice if a performance like Rudd's would get attention during awards season. They usually don't, these understated but really genuine performances. This is going to go down and one of his best roles. And Jason Segel, I don't know if he's really like that, but I'm always waiting for him to turn out to be a serial killer or something. (And don't take that the wrong way because he was my favorite on ""Freaks and Geeks"" back in the day.) He's playing this real oddball and you just don't know what to make of him until almost the end and it's like a surprise that shouldn't have been. I can't explain it without spoiling but and I can't even come up with a movie to compare it to.Like I said I think it's different. It's so very much it's own movie, and I just want to kiss it. It's so likable. It's like a teddy bear, or hot chocolate or Up with People. So if you like nice things, you should go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Review: ""I Love You, Man""","For the longest time, I could never really see Paul Rudd holding his own as the lead actor in a comedy. I always felt that he was at his best in a supporting role (i.e., Anchorman, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, etc.), making the audience listen intently whenever he graced the screen with his presence. However, as a leading man, I just didn't think it could be a good fit. This point seemed to be proved when Over His Dead Body was released to lukewarm reviews, but his starring turn in Role Models got me starting to change my mind. His transformation from perennial back-up guy to leading man is completed by I Love You, Man, where he plays the soon-to-be-married individual desperately trying to find a man to stand by his side on the altar. Jason Segel, fresh off his star-making performance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, plays that man, who happens to be nearly the exact opposite of Rudd's character. The two immediately click, and Segel takes Rudd through the process of learning to actually be a man, a regular guy's guy. Rashida Jones is great as well, but a good chunk of the laughs belong to the star-filled ensemble cast. From Andy Samberg and J.K. Simmons to Jon Favreau and Lou Ferrigno (as himself), each small role delivers not only laughs but an essential piece of the puzzle leading up to the film's finale which, although cliché and totally expected, is still pretty funny. All in all, this is a great twist on the rom-com genre with a pinch of raunchiness, and it makes for great viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Very funny movie-start to finish. Rudd's best performance!,"As others have posted, Judd Apatow didn't direct this movie but is sure seems as though he has. This movie works so well, on many levels - IMHO, this is Paul Rudd's best performance, to date. His portrayal of Kevin as he struggles to find male friends and a potential best man for his upcoming wedding, is endearing, awkward at times, hilarious so many other times. And realistic. So much of this movie just feels genuine. Jason Segel? Superb in his role as new friend Sydney. Rashida Jones - sweet, loyal and charming as Kevin's fiancé. From there every single supporting cast member does a nice job pulling off the plot/story/movie. Just see it - you won't regret renting/buying this movie.I Love You, Man is one of those endearing, charmingly funny movies that doesn't always come along. It's just nice when a movie like this does.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing Short of Hilarious...,"I have always been a fan of movies that Apatow Productions puts out. I Love You, Man was hilarious. Jason Seigel and Paul Rudd are great together, they both have a unique way of bringing comedy that keeps me laughing. I was surprised that there weren't any cameos from the usual actors in their movies (Seth Rogan, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, etc.) Anyone that liked movies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Knocked Up, you will love this movie! Paul Rudd plays a real estate agent, Peter, he has proposed to his girlfriend and has his life ahead of him, the only problem is, he doesn't have a best man. He doesn't have many male friends. He is supposed to sell Lou Ferrigno's house (The Incredible Hulk from the 1970's TV show) He has an open house and meets Jason Seigel's character, Sydney. This is where it gets the funniest.

Very entertaining!,"Although many parts of this movie were very predictable, it was still very entertaining. It was a nice change from the average love story, quite a twist on it actually! Paul Rudd and the others all make a good cast that works well together. With the right crowd, the movie offers nonstop laughter and is incredibly fun! All the characters remind me of at least one person I know (good and bad!).It is a huge cast with a couple great cameos by Lou Ferrigno, Rush, and many more. The music is great, as well as some of the running themes that go along with the film. I highly recommend this movie for the under thirty crowd. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not even Rush could save this bland comedy,"The fact that Rush are in the movie and that the main characters are Rush fans was the sole reason I decided to give this movie a try. Turns out that's the only thing to look forward to. Besides the couple scenes centered around Rush, this movie is mostly bland and forgettable. The acting isn't particularly great, the camera-work and direction are rather dull and unstylistic, and I couldn't bring myself to care about the characters very much. Things just sort of happen without much emotional weight. Since this is a comedy, I could forgive the lacking aspects of the film if it was at least funny. Unfortunately the movie isn't really that funny. I had two or three involuntary grins and chuckles but nothing made me involuntarily burst out laughing. Even their Rush fandom is only shown as surface level; only popular songs like ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Limelight"" are showcased (with a brief mention of ""Spirit of Radio"" somewhere in there) and I think it would have been more rewarding for viewers (who happen to be Rush fans) if they picked some lesser known songs. Not anything super obscure like ""Tai Shan"" or ""The Necromancer"", but how about something like ""Closer To The Heart"", ""Fly By Night"", or ""YYZ""? Sydney has a 2112 poster in his man cave but we never hear ""2112""! It also would have made sense for them to listen to some lesser known songs since Sydney is apparently a big enough fan that he bought a Geddy Lee Jazz Bass. A lot of people seem to love this movie and that's fine but I personally found it rather dull. Its not really worth checking out, even for Rush.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Woman's Perspective,"I would recommend this movie to anyone to enjoys to laugh, despite being a male or female viewer. It catches your attention from the very beginning, offering quick-witted humor that lets you forget that you arrived late and have to sit in the very front row of the sold out show. A good balance between crudeness and romance. While the love plot was there, it wasn't over played or mopey. ""The Office's"" Rashida Jones plays the confident fiancé quite well opposite Paul Rudd's geeky, friendless character. It is good to see a female lead who isn't too sensitive and over dramatic about typical couple squabbles. This allowed the main focus to stay on the relationship between Paul Rudd and Jason Segel- or the ""bromance"" as it is affectionately nicknamed. Neither my boyfriend nor I found the sexual content or language gratuitous- it fit well within the context of the story. Really enjoyed the funny ""bit"" parts in the movie. Andy Samberg brings his usual spin to the story as Rudd's popular gay brother. And look out for Jon Favreau as a disgruntled husband and ""mans man"" (married to Jaime Pressley). Overall I think that Judd Apatow put out another hilarious flick (minus his usual Rogan/ Hill match up). Rudd and Segel are fantastic as best buds in this original new comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

And 'I Love You, Man' is just, yet another feather in his well-decorated cap.

The Comical Fate of the Sensitive Male,"At the core of what looks on the surface to be a standard summer buddy movie is an intriguing premise: What does become of the overly sensitized male when confronted with the reality that all his closest friends are female and that he is at a complete loss to find any groomsmen, in particular, a best man, for his wedding? It's not an earth-shattering dilemma to address, yet the situation gives rise to a lot of amusing questions about what constitutes masculine behavior in our supposedly evolved society. Fortunately, director/co-writer John Hamburg (""Along Came Polly"") has fashioned a 2009 comedy (with co-writer Larry Levin) full of shrewd observations and hilarious gags that transcend formula and elevate the story into something fresh and genuinely likable.When sweet-natured L.A. real estate broker Peter Klaven decides to marry Zooey, his girlfriend of eight months, it dawns on both of them that he has no close male friends. Whispers about his manhood and her fear of him being too clingy as a husband lead Peter to set up a series of disastrous man-dates, one being the predictable mistaken gay date. However, it's at an open house at Lou Ferrigno's manse that he meets his personality opposite  Sydney Fife, a slovenly, blunt albeit socially observant slacker. As it turns out, their differences complement one another in a way that makes them best buddies almost from the get-go  that and a common obsession for the 1970's power band Rush. Naturally, Zooey starts to resent Sydney's burgeoning role in Peter's life - and things get complicated before the inevitable conclusion.Two of Judd Apatow's familiar rep company star. Finally at the center of a major movie, Paul Rudd is ideally cast as Peter since the role takes advantage of how he combines his boyish charm and unpredictable nebbishness into a memorable character. In fact, he makes Peter's awkward attempts to overcome his social anxiety a certain emotional resonance. We feel every painful step he takes in replicating Sydney's free spirit, and it becomes easy to root for his success. Much better cast here than as the self-conscious lead in last year's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", Jason Segel offers his doughy likability to a role that suits his casual, lumbering personality, even when he exposes an intimate secret between Peter and Zooey in a wedding party dinner toast.If the interplay between Rudd and Segel feels familiar from Apatow comedies like ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"", it is a coincidence that Hamburg takes full advantage of to keep the movie comically involving. Rashida Jones brings a raspy appeal to Zooey, although she is kept mostly at the sidelines. Also underused are Jaime Pressly as Zooey's tart-tongued friend Denise and as Peter's parents, J.K. Simmons (playing the same wiseass father he played in ""Juno"") and especially Jane Curtin. Jon Favreau has a thankless role as Denise's alpha-male jerk of a husband, while Andy Samberg makes a most unconvincing gay as Peter's sleep-around, personal trainer brother. There are plenty of laughs throughout its slightly long 105-minute running time, but what may surprise you is the number of insightful moments that this affectionate, satirical comedy provides.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Who else thought Jud Apatow did this?,"Really blatant attempt to ride his coat tails here I think. He's been hammering out hit after hit, and this movie sneaks in there, with two stars from some of his previous work (Using the same cast is an Apatow trademark), and tries to steal some of his box office power.I was expecting something with A Lot of laughs. It has Laughs, not a lot though. Not to say it doesn't have jokes throughout. They're just not that funny. Not a single big laugh out loud moment either. The humor is mostly built on a foundation of awkward moments, admittedly my least favorite of styles of humor.They waste some comedic gold in this movie. J.K. Simmons, Jane Curtin, Andy Samburg, I feel like they just didn't need such big names for small low-impact parts. Jon Favreau holds up well though.Jason Segel is good in it, but doesn't have the great material he got to write for himself in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.Paul Rudd I expected better from, but again I would say its more the scripts fault. I kept thinking he was great in .... well those Apatow movies, but he was always a great Co-Star! I wondered why didn't he get a starring role in one of his films. I thought this was the one until I sat through the credits thinking,""This was not the movie I thought I'd be seeing. Who actually made this!?"" One more parallel can be made. Its really close to the same sequence of events to The 40 Year-Old Virgin. Just instead of sex, substitute friendship. If you've seen both movies, think about it.Overall, its lighthearted. It has its share of chuckles. But I feel like I got suckered with this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Loved ""I Love You, Man""","In ""I Love You, Man"" Sydney (Jason Segal) gives an engagement dinner toast for aghast Peter (Paul Rudd). Sydney says to Peter's fiancé Zooey (pretty Rashida Jones), ""Give it back. Return the favor."" Later Peter asks bud Sydney to a golfing double date with Zooey's best friend Hailey (hilariously uptight Sarah Burns). Peter tells Sydney that he owes him for asking Zooey to give Peter oral sex in his dinner toast. Sydney confesses, ""You have a valid point."" The story by Director John Hamburg and Writer Larry Levin is brilliantly hysterical. The narrative threads whether it is man dates or air guitar at a Rush concert, are inventive and drop dead funny. Where else would you hear Zooey say to Peter, ""Who picks a f****ing fight with Lou Ferrigno?"" Paul Rudd has become the genius comic straight man in romantic comedies. Rudd and Jason Segal are a classic comedic team. Director Hamburg keeps it loose in this modern day ""bromance"". He gets hysterical performances from his entire cast including Jamie Pressly, J.K. Simmons, Tevin Downey, Andy Simmons, and Jane Curtin. As big as its laughs, Hamburg and Levin give ""I Love You, Man"" a bigger heart.Peter is a realtor in Los Angeles. When Peter introduces Zooey as his fiancé to his family, his gay brother Robbie (comfortable and cool Andy Samberg) tells Zooey, ""Peter's always been a girlfriend guy."" His Dad (brilliantly goofy J.K. Simmons) says, ""Peter never really had a best friend."" It soon becomes obvious that there may be something glaringly off with perfect Peter. Peter over hears Zooey and her friends at a girls' night at their place. Denise (funny sexy Jamie Pressly) points out that Peter not having any buddies is kind of creepy, and that he may become ""clingy"".Peter realizes that he must make friends with guys. Besides he has to find a Best Man for his wedding. Zooey is supportive in Peter's man dates. To that end Peter enrolls fitness trainer Robbie as his man date mentor. His first man date is a near disaster. Guys poker night with Denise's husband Barry (funny Jon Favreau) is nightmarishly funny.At an open house for his client Lou Ferrigno, Peter meets Sydney. Buddy inept Peter seems to connect with Sydney, who admits to coming to the open house for the free food. Apparent carefree slacker Sydney is an investor. They exchange business cards. Now it's up to Peter to man up and ask Sydney to go out and hang. Rudd is genius in his awkwardness in trying way too hard to be one of the guys. Peter and Sydney finally meet up for beer and tacos—they bond. Soon Peter and Sydney are playing bass and guitar to their favorite Rush songs. Concerned Zooey soon wonders if she is losing Peter. Happy-go-lucky bachelor Sydney is not all that he seems. His friends are gradually growing away with family and other responsibilities. As much as Peter needs bro Sydney, Sydney is also wanting.Predictably the Third Act becomes the resolution of Peter's relationship with Zooey and Sydney. Here ""I Love You, Man"" is surprisingly compassionate. It still maintains hysterical crassness throughout. However, there is something very heartwarming when Peter admits, ""I love you, man."" Paul Rudd is amazing as Peter, who is doing his best to fit in and make things right. ""I Love You, Man"" works, because Rudd can be with funny. Jason Segal is natural whacked out, but never over done as Sydney. Rashida Jones is vulnerable charm as Zooey. ""I Love You, Man"" is one of the funniest and smartest movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I Love You, Man may not be very, very hilarious, but it certainly has a soul. And for a rom-com, that is as close as being godly.","Is this a Judd Apatow film? No, it is a John Hamburg film. I Love You, Man is one of the more accomplished romantic-comedies of the year. And it is hard to believe that Apatow was not involved. After the success of The 40-Year Old Virgin (2005) and Knocked Up (2007), Apatow's singular influence in a new modern sub-genre - adult rom-coms with a heart - has perhaps finally found a non-Apatow offering a worthy entry to add to its cause.Peter Klaven is getting married soon. He is popular with girls but he has no close male friends. So when it is time to select a best man for his wedding, he is faced with the embarrassing prospect of selecting nobody. At an open house, he meets Sydney Fife and what comes next is the beginning of a very beautiful friendship. The film works out to be like a generic comedy about the bonds of brotherhood and what not. But unlike its kind, the film is made with a kind of zest and energy that invite viewers to embrace it.I Love You, Man is written and directed by Hamburg, whose strong focus on character development here is the film's most outstanding achievement. The characters Peter (Paul Rudd) and Sydney (Jason Segel) are wonderfully portrayed by their actors whose roles are not only excellently-written, they are naturally appealing to viewers as well because they seem like the kind of people we might know. The chemistry between Rudd and Segel is just right, never awkward, and never gayish.The film's dialogue is another plus point. This is where similarities to Apatow's films become more noticeable. The script is saucy with a fair number of references to sexual behavior from blowjobs to masturbation and one amusing observation of someone attempting to fart secretly. Yet most laughs are generated by the remarkable comic timing that comes from Rudd especially in scenes when his character fumbles socially with men and during initial nervous attempts at conversing with Sydney.Most crucially, Hamburg's film has such a light-hearted honesty to it that it is difficult not to enjoy the tonic. It is the kind of film that you would love to see again, maybe this time with another bro-mate. Please stay for the end credits for more scenes of Rudd, Segel and their friends. Till this point, the characters have been so well-developed (including supporting ones) that one glance at their faces and you could probably describe their Facebook profile without seeing it and getting it real close. I Love You, Man may not be very, very hilarious, but it certainly has a soul. And for a rom-com, that is as close as being godly.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Fun, uplifting & well balanced comedy !!","Paul Rudd is an actor who's movies I've always enjoyed watching, but I wasn't too sure what to expect of ""I Love You, Man"", teaming up with ""How I met your mother's"" Jason Segel. What I got to see though was a great comedy with a lot of heart!I guess it just seemed to me that the concept of this movie was very easily going to lend itself to become the formula for a very generic comedy, but nothing could be lesser true! There were even times at which I thought the movie was going to fall into familiar traps and play out the usual ""girlfriend feels rivaled by best-friend-card or similar"", but ""I love You, Man"" continually avoids these traps and focuses more on the real problems ""Peter Klaven"" (Rudd) is having in dealing with the fact he has no real friends or buddies instead, and what happens when he tries his best to turn that around radically. That sets up numerous situations that are genuinely funny and also really make you feel for the ""Peter"" character.A lot of credit for the above mentioned is also due to a great performance by Paul Rudd who does excellent in portraying a softy/nice guy who just doesn't seem to have the skills/feel to engage in your average buddy-comradery and finds himself struggling because of it. Segel also holds his own as the loose-as-a-goose-new-buddy and it's obvious that Rudd & Segel play perfectly of off each other and make the on-screen friendship work instantly.Add to that an excellent supporting cast and what you have is a fairly original comedy that manages to tell a story of finding balance in a relationship/engagement and the friendships around it in a very humorous way without ever making either topic more important than the other.Definitely a feel-good movie, definitely recommended!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

John Hamburg has put together one of the better comedies I've seen lately. It never goes overboard or becomes too silly. Directing is tight, but loose enough to make it fun to watch.I highly recommend this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good God this is a chick flick,"Terrible. A boardroom full of idiot women on the same cycle definitely masterminded this gem. Jason Segel is garbage. Paul Rudd gets a pass here because he has had so many good films before this. Not even an appearance by Rush can save this movie. This movie has about as much depth as Dunston Checks In. If only they could've gotten that chimp to play Jason Segel's character...If there is any buzz about this movie, it's the buzz of flies around this heaping pile of dog crap.

A cool friendship flick.,"No, this ain't another Brokeback Mountain. I Love You, Man has a ton of gay moments, but of the fun variety, not the sexual attribute kind. The movie tackles the niceties of male friendship, and it does so without even the slightest hint of homosexuality. And that's what makes it a very cool friendship movie.I Love You, Man is a movie about man-to-man friendship, male bonding, drinking beer, talking about who you had sex with and how, jamming, going hiking, taking a dog out to poop, standing up for a buddy, giving career tips, helping him shop, playing poker, watching games, playing games, sharing masturbation techniques, screaming at the top of your voice, loaning money, and just plain hanging out for no reason.Starring Paul Rudd (the Mike from Friends, who Phoebe marries) and Jason Segel, the story goes thus: Rudd's character, Peter Klaven, is getting married but doesn't have any male friends. He has no one close enough to be his best man. All his friends are chicks. His fiancé, and her friends, find this unusual and hence, Peter Klaven sets out to find a friend. He goes on numerous man-dates that fail miserably. Enter, Segel's character – Sydney Fife. The two meet and get on like a house on fire. The rest is what makes this movie rock.Rudd plays an introvert while Segel plays an extrovert. The two share terrific on screen chemistry. I simply had to call up my best friend after watching I love You, Man to tell him that I loved him.I love You, Man is a light-hearted fun flick, with all the right emotions in the right places, you'll love it. Watch it with your best friend and you'll love it even more.Check out more of my reviews on http://asatirecalledlife.wordpress.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightful comedy about male friendship.,"After watching ""I Love You Man"" I just can't seem to shift the feeling of joy I'm left with.Filled with laugh out loud moments and scenes of more gentle comedy, this film about male friendship genuinely put a smile on my face.The movie is in a similar mould to writer/director John Hamburgs previous comedies ""Meet The Parents"" and ""Meet the Fockers"" but seems to have a more personal feel to it than his previous efforts.There is a brilliant chemistry between leading duo Paul Rudd and Jason Segel which feels realistic and natural, you can almost imagine these two men to be great friends in real life.Relatively unknown to me actress Rashida Jones gives a cute performance and there is hilarious performances from many of the supporting cast including Jaime Pressly, Jon Favreau and Lou Ferrigno (playing himself).The soundtrack really suits the film with some kooky pop songs to add to the feel of the movie.I would recommend this movie to any fans of this genre and I'm sure it'll put a smile on your face, just like it did mine.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film makes it impossible for the viewer not to enjoy!,"I saw the trailer for this a good six months ago at the cinema and it grabbed me straight away i was looking forward to seeing it. Unfortunately i didn't get time to actually see it so i was then waiting for the DVD release! so i've been waiting to see it for a while, it was worth the wait.One of the things i loved about the film was the plot!. OK so comedy films don't usually feel the need for anything major i guess to an extent that's the point of them. But this film had a new and fresh story to tell. Instead of the usual problems in relationships that get picked on a hundred times a year by Hollywood this one took a new approach. It was about a friendless guy who was struggling to make friends later on in life, a situation i know for a fact a lot of people have been / are in.It wasn't unbelievable at all it was actually quite the opposite.The other quality i thought the film had was perfect casting they all did there jobs well and they couldn't have really picked anyone better to do it!. Segel and Rudd make for an awesome on-screen combo providing big laughs scene after scene.But it's not all just stupid gags (although that is what the film does best) it feels pretty genuine and there are a few lessons in friendship in there, stuff that actually made me think about relationships i have with my own friends.Overall it was one of the most enjoyable films i've seen in a while, it's just a good film in every way it could've been and much more than i expected!.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

slappa da bass!!,I Love You Man delivers with its odd predicament about a man in search of a best man for his wedding. Something that very few men watching this movie would relate to which is why this movie is so hilarious. Paul Rudd has definitely proved he can be one of the funniest actors in any comedy and it doesn't just have to be people like Seth Rogen or Will Ferrel taking over the comedy world.I Love You man consists of hilarious one liners that will have you quoting the movie days after watching. Jason Segel is a great co-star to Paul Rudd and the two make a great comedic duo. The situations the two of them get into are awkward and so bizarre that you cant help but laugh at the scenarios. The thing I loved most about the movie were the many pop culture references and guest appearance by Lou Ferrigno. This movie also made me love Rush more than I already do. Go see and enjoy this movie for its many laughs,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Keith Hernandez at the gym,"Seen that Seinfeld with Keith Hernandez and the man relationship? Expect a similar concept here. One of the writers helped pen that episode. In other good news this movie has a great plot line. The story takes some twists and turns and doesn't become particularly predictable until the end. So basically this guy is trying to find a best man and as a consequence ends up going on mandates and of course there is some effect on his relationship with his fiancée as a result. The characters are well developed and the dialog is convincing. While I don't think this is any kind of revolutionary movie in the comedic drama realm, it has few downfalls so I have to give it a 9/10 with plans to watch it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Rude, Crude and Surprisingly Good","I have been an avid movie watcher for 20 years and a big fan of IMDb for the past 4-5 but this is my first post. I had to write a response to the comment I read in regards to this movie not being good.I was fortunate enough to get a free sneak preview pass from a friend and was able to watch I love You Man last night. First off, people going to see this movie must understand what they are getting themselves into. If you have not enjoyed 40 year-old virgin, Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, or any of those kind of outrageous comedies, you probably should save your $10 and wait until someone forces you to be entertained. Going into the movie with a negative attitude will leave you feeling even worse once you leave the theater.I have enjoyed all those comedy's but I felt that this one might have fallen up short, but I was completely wrong. From the beginning of the movie, it had me, along with the entire audience of the theater laughing out loud. Character development of Peter Klaven was put together by the inadequacies he has towards making friends with only women and not men. People who might not find this funny is someone who can relate to Peter and it can work vice versa. One of the only things I found annoying is this trait of Peter. I hated how he didn't know how to talk to a guy. Unlike 40 year-old virgin, he put the Dick on the pedestal.Throughout the entire movie its straight comedy without steering off the plot of the movie. Jon Favreau takes the role of the dickhead alpha-male and plays it to perfection. Jason Segal is the true I don't give a flying puck male and once again, the character is played to perfection.I didn't want to give the movie away by showing examples because I know I hate reading spoilers before I see a movie. Just understand that the movie is rude, crude and surprisingly good.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why do I listen to people,"I listened to people rant and rave about this movie. I walked into the video store only to see a movie cover with a white background on it and three people in the foreground. Typically these movies have either two girls and a guy on the cover but in this case it's two guys and a girl. It doesn't matter what the title is because it's always the same crap. Some funny jokes at the start of the movie, followed by some epiphany or keen observation we can all relate too in our personal lives that make us go ""Ohh yea.... I've seen people do that before"". Then there is a love triangle, followed by some white lies when we all the know the audience is saying ""Just tell the truth"" or ""Don't say that"". Then some people don't talk to each other anymore cause they're mad but at the end there's this big long speech about how sorry they are and they can't go on without one another.OK wait, what movie was i talking about? How to lose a guy in 10 days? No wait, Wedding Crashers,... no not that oh it's He;s just not that into you? crap i forgot, knocked up? the gay firefighter Adam sandler movie? No no wait it's Maid of Honor, 27 dresses. OH YEA!!!! I remember it's called I love you man.Dear Hollywood, please stop recycling your shitty white covered movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good ""Date Night"" DVD","Plenty of laughs in this ""bromance"" between a shy, insecure real estate agent (Rudd) and a goofy, man-child (Segal) he meets at an Open House. Lots of supporting talent (Samberg, Curtin, Simmons, the Hulk, et al) and the lovely Rashida Jones as Rudd's patient and understanding fiancée make this quite enjoyable to watch. It is also fascinating to witness the awkward Rudd attempt to forge new male friendships; it's almost a sociological study at times, and I felt a tremendous amount of empathy for him. I thought Segal's character was great -- he wasn't the one-dimensional guy's guy that shows up too often in film, there was some substance there (but his dog-walking routine needs some cleaning up!), and Andy Samberg was great as the gay brother who is socially more of a traditional ""guy"" than the straight Rudd. I also found it interesting that TMI (too much information) being shared is just as bothersome to guys as it is to us ladies. Definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I hated it, man.","I'm a huge fan of Paul Rudd and I thought Jason Segel was going to anchor this film's comedy force, but honestly, I found myself hoping it would end sooner by time it marked sixty minutes.Comedy you see in the trailers is pretty much the only comedy in the movie. It seems Paul Rudd either improvised his lines in this, similar to his roles in Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin and the like. I couldn't stop cringing at how unfunny he was in this latest role.Jason Segel was the only person who had any sort of comedic lines, and there wasn't many, aside from the trailer shown clips. My biggest laugh was ""This is my nightmare"" seen in the trailer(s). I can't even begin to describe how terrible Zooey Rice is. Zooey is perhaps the worst fiancée in history. She flips out on Peter (Rudd) multiple times because of Sydney (Segel) and how their friendship is building.I nearly turned off this movie at the mark when you think ""well maybe they won't get married."" It was very difficult for me to get to the credits and when I finally did, I was happy that it was over. The title of the film is not quoted till the very end and it doesn't give you any everlasting effect.I seriously hope Rudd's next film has a better comedic role for him because if it doesn't make me laugh, I will start losing faith in his comedies. Maybe he should stick to Judd Apatow.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining,"I went to this movie knowing only what I had seen in the trailer. I was afraid I was going to one of those gratuitous teen movies (i.e. American Pie or Super Bad). While there were some strong sexual comments and innuendos, I was pleasantly surprised to watch a humorous movie about relationships and friendship. Paul Rudd was playing one of his best characters as a person who is ""a fish out of water"" and Jason Segal was delightful as the friend who is a little strange and you never know what he is going to do next. As an over 40 Mom, I enjoyed the movie and felt that it was worth the price of the ticket. My teen-aged daughter loved it. So if you are looking for a base, vulgar teen movie, you will be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Another home run comedy,"Last year, Paul Rudd appeared in Role Models  one of the flat out funniest films I have seen maybe in the last decade.Last year, Jason Segel appeared in Forgetting Sarah Marshall  a film from Judd Apatow that was funnier than the two more popular Knocked Up! and Superbad films.This year, Paul Rudd and Jason Segel are together in I Love You, Man. Surely, we can't expect these two comic underdogs to hit yet another one out of the park.Yes, we can, and Yes, they did.I Love You, Man's plot is detailed in the two minute trailer. Rudd, who plays Peter is getting married but doesn't have that close male friend to call upon as Best Man at his wedding. Peter then undergoes various 'man-dates' in hopes of finding a male best friend. Enter, Sydney Fife (Segel). The two meet innocently enough at a home showing and immediately, Peter is in awe of someone as honest as what Sydney appears to be.The two end up meeting at a bar and over fish taco's, a friendship is born. All they have to do is keep things on an even keel before the wedding. This being a comedy, there is fat chance of that.I Love You, Man is a much stronger story and far funnier than Knocked Up!, although it still sits in the shadow of last years more gut busting, Role Models.It does fall into the new trend of adult comedy which over the years has progressed from college humor antics to strong characters making realistic life choices. We can thank Judd Apatow for this movement, even if his name is not attached to this gem.Much like Apatow's Superbad and Knocked Up!, some of the best laughs and strongest characters come from the supporting cast. J.K. Simmons and Jon Favreau continue their streak of stealing scenes with limited screen time. Favreau in particular does a good job playing Barry, a crass and arrogant friend-in-law of the Peter and Zooey (Rashida Jones), keeping him interesting even through his white knuckle ignorance.Like most comedies, the final chapters become predictable with an even more conventional break-up/make-up of the central characters. I Love You, Man would have been better served to produce a Badder Santa type of ending rather than trying to fairy-tale it all up.But that is small consequence in a film that brings the goods for nine tenths of the films runtime. And Rudd and Segel can now brag that they have another home run on their resume. Even if this one barely cleared the fence. www.robertsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Ever seen a movie? OK, then you don't need to see this one.","Judd Apatow's group of friends is this generation's frat pack - Owen Wilson, Ben Stiller, and Vince Vaughn are aging, and someone needs to fill the void. Though Judd was not involved in this movie, it stars Paul Rudd and Jason Segal, two if his favorite players, and Apatow's influence is obvious. However, even Apatow's involvement probably couldn't have a saved a film from a premise this trite and predictable. A man realizes he has no friends and needs to find a best man. That's it. There's no complexity, no subplot, nothing. That's fine for a comedy. Many great comedies have even less story than that. But the difference between those movies and I Love You Man is that they're FUNNY. When a film's feature character is in a relatable situation - for example, Ben Stiller in Meet the Parents or the kids in Superbad - it's easy to connect with them, and that makes jokes easy. But a 30-year-old guy who realizes he has NEVER had any friends... how does that happen? Who has ever found themselves in a situation where they're about to marry a gorgeous babe and then says... wait a minute, I don't have a best man! Without a relatable protagonist to fall back on, all the ""jokes"" fall flat. There are a few gags that make you laugh the first time you hear them... but they get pressed over and over again through the film until you can't stand it. The film relies on Segal to carry it, and while Segal can be a great supporting actor in other films, as can Rudd, neither can carry a film. It's like casting Steve Buscemi in a lead role. It just doesn't work. The film tries to circumvent being predictable by avoiding events and situations that seem obvious, which is a smart move... but then it doesn't fill those holes in. There just seem to be missing conflicts, and there's not an ounce of depth to any of the characters. Again, that's find for a comedy, but who are we supposed to cheer for? Lou Ferrigno and Thomas Lennon (from Reno 911) are hilarious in this movie, but their combined screen time is about 5 minutes, which isn't worth the price of admission or the time wasted watching the rest of the film.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

He need to endure the lonely of man-kind. He has some kind of silly principles too. So i guess that every man and woman would have some silly principles which we could personal style.

"Charming and sweet, gross and funny.","Paul Rudd, one of the best comic actors in work today, does some of his best work as Peter Klaven, a man engaged to the beautiful and bubbly Zooey, played wonderfully by Rashida Jones, who has a severe lack of guy buddies to hang out with or for that matter be the best man in his wedding. His family decides to help out and send him on a bunch of exotic ""man-dates"" with different guys that don't seem to work too well. Then, Sydney Fife comes along. Portrayed by the very funny Jason Segel, Sydney is the antithesis of Peter: bold, daring, and utterly and completely acceptable of his inner manhood. He and Peter hit it off due to their common lack of male friends as well as a love for the band Rush.Despite the simple premise and the lack of surprise and originality, Rudd and Segel make it pay off by just making us laugh as well as care about these characters. Rudd, in particular is so good at timing and understanding the basics of being funny and sweet at the same time. You really feel for this guy and want him to end up happy as well as Zooey and Sydney. Director/co-writer John Hamburg does a great job with getting the most out of his incredible cast as well as making the most out of a somewhat lame plot. After the many comedies we have seen over the years involving platonic men relationships such as Superbad and Pineapple Express, this is the most endearing and touching. I'm sure a lot of guys out there feel like Peter, and perhaps seeing this film will inspire them to go out and make a new friend. For that reason alone, I encourage anyone to go see this charming, gross, sweet but ultimately very funny movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great Potential Ruined by Filth,"This movie had enormous potential, both material and acting ability. Paul Rudd is a complex and talented actor. This movie has some very funny moments. However, (and, I should have suspected this to be the case in ANY R-rated COMEDY) these funny moments, and the movies vast bulk of POTENTIAL, were steeped and mired in an all-pervasive vulgarity, licentious behavior and rude, crude and obnoxious ""jokes."" For those who care about such things, God's name is also abused too many times to count.These things are INEXCUSEABLE in a COMEDY that would have been funnier WITHOUT all this impure trash, tripe and sacrilegious additions which have been ""hung on"" to this movie and seem to be without any merit other than to ""smut up"" the movie. Apparently Hollywood thinks this type of tripe necessary. Hollywood doesn't learn very quickly.One would THINK the dollar signs from ""The Passion of the Christ"" would be enough to get their attention, and signal that quite a majority of folks prefer more wholesome entertainment. One may think that, but one would be wrong. Hollywood doesn't seem to be ABLE to learn that lesson, no matter how much money movies like that make.If they remade this movie and even toned it down to normal everyday* behavior and language, this COULD BE quite a good movie. Until then, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.*(I know they cry realism to defend this type of execrable refuse, but I do not know anyone who acts and talks in this way, and certainly not to this degree--and as a physician, I am acquainted with quite a range of human behaviors!)",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Truly a movie to be watched,"Whether this type of story may be a possibility or not the fact is that this movie is simple yet highly gripping. Casting for the main lead, a part from Jason Segel, could have been better but as per expression of the story with what casting was made, the story was beautifully iterated. Screenplay was great for this type of movie. Interestingly due to the fact of this movie not being a more comedy oriented flick with the inclusion of a 'rom com' type of genre inculcated, it easily appeals to the whole target audience above the age of 17.An important factor is the variation in role given to Jason Segel for those who watch How I Met your Mother. True, he plays a comic role but the difference is that with the addition of language which one has not seen him say before and the extended liberty present for this character to be played, Jason Segel grasps the opportunity and performs well.Overall, this movie, yes, can be missed, but definitely if your bored, a movie fanatic, Jason Segel fan, genre of comedy fan, or any other relevant group, this is a movie which would not only entertain you because although one may not remember particular aspects of the movie, a feeling of content is experienced, which is by far a highly regarded feeling to have after the viewing of a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

'Bromantic' Hilarity,"A feel- good, buoyant 'bromance', 'I Love You, Man' typifies the elements that can make a regular, orthodox comedy successful. First and foremost, it does make you laugh owing to great characters and it does add a slightly new spin on things. Sometimes, it does feel like the box office is flooded with comedies not too different to this, but it's the minority that realise characters are the key to giving the audience gratification. 'I Love You, Man' certainly belongs to that minority.All the same, it follows a simple path which is far from frenetic and completely impromptu a la 'The Hangover' for instance. It's centered around a relatively boring guy and his very contrasting friend and these opposites attract with results that are amusing, good fun and fresh. These two men drive each other toward some juvenile behaviour, Jason Segel being the perpetrator, an adolescent in a grown man's body in many ways. But the humour itself isn't overly immature, neither is it excessively crude or imbecilic but 'bromantically' innocent. There was more focus on this facet than on the romantic aspect of the film, which took a back seat making this far more male friendly.The free-spirited Sydney Fife as played by Jason Segel, certainly fascinates you. His name makes him sound awful important, but he never seems to work and is perpetually biding his time in his 'man cave' with quite expensive ornaments adorning the walls. At first glance, he occurs to be a jobless grunge but he's fun, pleasure seeking and supposedly, a smart investor, after all, it isn't possible to facilitate such living without some brains. Segel's characters may read like total numbskulls, but he acts them out in a friendly and affable manner.The protagonist, Peter Klaven, is another of those socially awkward characters that Paul Rudd plays in a manner in which he looks like quite the loser but is associative in a strange kind of way, associative to the point that he becomes humorous.Another refreshing change was seeing an impactful and useful supporting cast who left no stone unturned and infused their own sense of comedy through their characters making this more than just a show run by Rudd and Segel. Jon Favreau and J.K. Simmons in particular used stronger personalities to juxtapose with Rudd's reluctant character to great effect.The movie shows that congregating with a bunch of dudes doesn't mean pulling out 'man classics' like 'Die Hard' or 'Happy Gilmore' for the 77th time. 'I Love You, Man' could be a worthy addition to that exclusive list.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Awesome, Just Awesome!","Awesome movie just awesome. Very original awkward humor that just had the whole theater laughing from start to finish. Good nice story about friendship too. Just a movie that will make you laugh and fell good which is what comedies are meant to do. Best thing about it was that it was crude and raunchy but also smart and intelligent. Paul Rudd and Jason Segal were just great in this. I loved Role Models and Forgetting Sarah Marshall but I have to say both guys are better in this movie then they were separately in those films. If you like those movies will definitely enjoy this film as well. The rest of the cast was great too with a hilarious star studded supporting cast which included Rashida Jones, Jaime Pressly, Jon Favreau, Andy Samberg, Lou Ferrigno and J.K. Simmons. Also funny performances from lesser known but recognizable funny people Joe Lo Truglio, Thomas Lennon and Rob Huebel.Just a very fun good bromance comedy that will stand as one of the best comedies and most quoted movies of the year. I recommend anyone who likes to laugh to go see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"great movie,combining friendship and love in a humorous package.","this movie is very enjoyable, not only because of the outstanding performance of the actors and a unique, but humorous storyline, but also because it is so much more than what meets the eye. it portrays the true value of real friendship along with true love.also, the humor supplied by Jason Segel is simply priceless. this is one movie that you will definitely enjoy watching over and over again. Paul Rudd plays the role of an average Joe very genuinely. the countless hours spent at the 'man- cave', along with rush sons will certainly adhere to anyone with a good movie taste. this is one of the few movies without slapstick humor and cheap jokes. movies like these come out very rarely, and it is certainly one of segel's best.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"I like you, bro","I Love You, Man tackles a weirdly forgotten problem in the world and that is the grown male with little to no male friends, or friends in general. Work dominates much of our adult lives and free time has become something we choose to make rather than something that comes included with our work. Some of us don't have the kind of time we want to do simple things like hang out, read, or grab drinks after work. I see this issue more prominent in America than people see.Here's a probable scenario brought forth in John Hamburg's I Love You, Man. Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) is the kind of man I described above, about to marry the wonderful Zooey Rice (Rashida Jones) and working as a real-estate agent. However, when he overhears Zooey and her friends talking about how guys like Peter, who really have no male friends, may become clingy and needy to their woman, Peter states bluntly and without reservation, ""I need to get some f****** friends."" So he tries. He tries to bond with his gay brother's friends at the gym, to little avail. He even tries to bond with some of his wife's friends' husbands to try and get on their good side. It isn't until he meets the offbeat but well-meaning investor Sydney Fife (Jason Segel) at an open house for his client Lou Ferigno. Sydney tells Peter the only reason he is at this particular open house is to take advantage of the free food and the abundance of divorcees that frequent these kinds of gatherings.Peter and Sydney strike up a bond that is almost immediate, both around the same age, both quirky in their own way, and each balancing each other out - Peter being straight-laced and awkward, Sydney being quick-witted and free-spirited. Peter is convinced he has met his best man, but Zooey thinks otherwise, as the wedding date nears and Peter spends little time with her.The film rests on the chemistry its actors provide, a typical trait of raunchy comedies from this time period. Rudd and Segel are fun-loving guys, and their buddy-buddy conversations and activities together will possible rekindle the memories of a man's best man or, for younger or unmarried souls, find a bit of themselves and their best friend in these characters. A scene at a Rush concert where Peter and Sydney are singing the band's song ""Limelight"" loudly and pretending to play their instruments (as well as engaging in some hilariously off-color behavior) is a prime example of the hilarity that ensues when two friends get together. The person that brings the child out in you. You can age and mature for many years but as soon as you see that person, you become your childish self again.The only issue I found with the film is that the material here seems more well-suited for a drama than a comedy. It wouldn't surprise me if writers Hamburg and Larry Levin recognized this early on, in addition. The reason being is that the second half of the film overdoes Peter's awkward phone conversations with Sydney and uncomfortable actions in general to the point where we think Peter is either socially inept beyond belief or has some sort of condition. By the end of the film, that seems to be the only card the film knows how to play.Because of this, the humor gets redundant. How often must we watch a man make an idiot of himself to the point where we laugh at him more than with him? Had the second half become more fixated on the drama and the realizations of marriage and friendlessness, there would've been something even more subversive than the material at hand.As it stands, I Love You, Man is a fun film, a break from the comedies with big actors that fail to deliver, and one that proposes a problem that I still believe is more prominent than people think. However, this is a rare case of a smart film unfortunately not being smart enough, but it's just smart enough to succeed and be rewarding entertainment.Starring: Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Rashida Jones, Lou Ferigno, and Andy Samberg. Directed by: John Hamburg.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hilarious film with an Apatow feel,"I thought that the film was hilarious from start to finish. It had a Judd Apatow tone to the film, too (40 Year Old Virgin, Superbad, Knocked Up, Pineapple Express). Paul Rudd is an under-credited actor. I also thought he was hilarious in Role Models, and really made both of these films enjoyable. Jason Segel is an upcoming actor, too, with a charismatic and energetic presence on screen. I read a comment on this film earlier that was bashing the film because Jason Segel is overweight and out of shape. Really?? Does body appearance make a comedy film? NO! Look at Seth Rogen. He's hilariously funny in ANY movie he makes and he's about 50 pounds overweight. I just feel that this movie is a must-see for comedy lovers (like me). Just as good, if not better, than Knocked Up or Pineapple Express. Last thing, I don't understand the R rating though. They do have the occasional F bomb (maybe 3 or 4), but overall, I thought the humor was pretty tame.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mediocre comedy,"I could easily sum up my feelings on this one in three words: Not Enough Laughs. But I'll go a little further, 'cause I know that's hardly satisfying. Paul Rudd is a newly engaged man who realizes that he doesn't have any male friends. Where his future wife has seven brides maids, he hasn't a groomsman to his name, let alone a Best Man. The film plays like a romance, except it's about a guy looking for a guy friend. It even ends with his guy friend rushing to the wedding. The guy he finds is Jason Segel, who, for the first time, gets Rudd to act like a guy. Which, of course, ends up upsetting his wife-to-be. Everything's very predictable here. But, I'll say it again, it would all be forgivable if there were laughs. There are some, but never big ones. I might be more forgiving if it weren't for the bevy of fantastic comedies we've had in the past few years. Last year alone there was Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Step Brothers and Pineapple Express. Those three are enough to keep you laughing for weeks, and you remember the laughs. So many laughs, in fact, that after I saw each of those films I forgot many of those laughs. Not because they were forgettable, but because other big laughs replaced the first laughs! Nothing at all like that here. For the first time in a while, at least among the other films made by the actors featured in this film, almost all of the good moments were in the commercials. And, I must add, this film must set a record for the biggest waste of a great cast: Jaime Pressly, Jane Curtin, J.K. Simmons, Andy Sandberg, Joe Lo Truglio and Thomas Lennon appear. Most of them get a joke or two (except Curtin  why cast Jane Curtin and not give her one gag?), but with all those great comedians, you want more.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
An underrated comedy showcase for Paul Rudd,"""I Love You, Man"" is a comedy with a premise so simple that I'm surprised I've never seen anything quite like it before. Paul Rudd plays a man who has just popped the question to his girlfriend, who happily accepted. Unfortunately, he has no close male friends to serve as a Best Man so he tries desperately to strike up a friendship before his wedding date arrives.Paul Rudd is the heart and soul of this movie. I always thought that he was a decent actor but here he really struts his stuff. He's perfect for the character and has great interplay with Jason Segel, an actor who I never really cared for before this movie. The producers also acted wisely in filling the cast with a number of funny individuals in supporting roles, including Jon Favreau, Jaime Pressly, Adam Samberg, J.K. Simmons and others.The script is strong with much of the comedy coming from character rather than situations. There's a bit of gross out humour but mostly the humour is less lowbrow and more observational. In terms of technical achievement, the movie looks and sounds fine but doesn't distinguish itself from other films.Finally, it is inevitable to compare this movie to ""The Hangover"", 2009's biggest comedy hit. I have no problem stating that this film is the better of the two. Naturally, senses of humour will differ but I am surprised to see so much of a disparity between the two in terms of user ratings.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
kind of a stupid idea,"The story was awful. What kind of a writer could think of such a plot? I don't know any man around me who doesn't have at least a friend or two. Especially I don't understand how men could spend time and make friends like that. Dudes, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Men discovered new continents, fought wars to defend their countries... Now you watch that stupid shoot about going for a ""man date"" or ""never punching anyone in the face""?! What media does to people... It looks like slowly but steadily men are turned into women, at least on the screen. What will they show us next? How cool it is to buy some roses or, perhaps, chocolates to your best man? Yuck! Go grab some beer instead, don't waste your time on this stuff.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Solid, and super funny","Just an all around great comedy from 2 great actors, Paul Rudd and Jason Segel. Arguably one of my favorite movies. Uses a great deal of comedy to deal with the issues faced by Paul Rudd's character. Keeps you laughing the whole time, while also giving an insight to some potentially very real struggles. While I do admit that I will watch just about anything starring either Jason Segel or Paul Rudd, and I'm sure that contributes to my love for this movie, that isn't the only reason. With so many memorable (and very quotable) moments/scenes, there's good reason that I've seen it over and over again. Although it may not be an amazing movie that would win a bunch of awards, it's a lighthearted film that I think many people can enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Actually a good movie! wow....,"I seriously watched this movie and almost turned it off a couple times, because i thought it was going to be completely stupid and lame.How could a movie with ""I love you man"" as the title, possibly be any good.But WOW, I gotta admit....great uplifting and funny movie.The trailer makes it look funny, but you sort of get that ""lame"" feeling about it.....well at least I got that vibe about it.But it's frigging hilarious.....Basically it's about your typical uptight real-estate agent, who is getting married, has EVERYTHING going great....until he is preparing for the wedding and realizes that he has practically ZERO male friends. So he's sort of trying to meet guys, in hopes of finding someone to be his ""best man"" at the wedding. While at the same time, everyone is laughing behind his back. So he's out trying to meet male friends, and prove everyone else wrong. (he's got really goofy/odd social skills with guys, and always stumbles over his words and can't pull off typical ""guy stuff"")But that's what MAKES this movie so frigging great....I gotta admit, i laughed my ass off most of the way through this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A less that zero,"I don't know what film other reviewers were watching but I don't think it was this one!This film is AWFUL from beginning to end.

An Entertaining Watch,"I would not say this is as funny as Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but it still has a lot of laughs. I would say this movie is targeted at a larger audience than other comedies like Superbad and Anchorman. Jason Segel and Paul Rudd are fantastic, and Rashida Jones steps up into the spotlight quite well.This movie utilizes a lot of different types of humor (instead of just sex jokes), through the variety of characters in this movie. One thing I must say is that you won't have one favorite character in this movie, but several, because there is so much comedic talent in this cast.If you liked Forgetting Sarah Marshall, or wanted something a little more appropriate, then I Love You, Man, is right for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Delightful Flick- Segel and Rudd are great together,"Funny, honest, and with a great cast- I Love You, Man may not be the best comedy of the year- but is certainly is a good one nevertheless. Paul Rudd and Jason Segel make for a great pair throughout the film, and you can truly laugh and smile seeing their friendship grow as the film goes along. It's a simple film really, about the importance of friends, growing up, and taking control of your life- nothing we haven't see in comedy films before. The thing that is different about I Love You, Man is its energy. You can truly feel the chemistry between the characters on screen, rather than just feel the gags around them. It's not perfect, it has its share of romantic film cliches, and formulaic plot devices- but I truly did find myself with a smile on my face throughout most of the film, and if that isn't a sign it's worth a watch, I don't know what is. In the end, I Love You Man isn't a great comedy, but it's delightful time at the movies, and I encourage any fans of Segel and Rudd, as well as Rom-coms in general, to give it a try.
My Rating: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A few super funny moments,"7.8 stars.I recall this being absolutely roll-on-the-floor hilarious when I watched it about six years ago. For some strange reason it's not quite as funny this time around. Either way, this is one of the funniest films of the 21st century.Paul Rudd is absolutely genius, and we really get to see him shine in all of his comedic glory. I think they just let him go for this one, and it was brilliant. You will notice that the first act or two is not as funny, but once Mr. Segel is introduced, Mr. Rudd's character begins to loosen up. It's almost ironic how the actor becomes funny simultaneously with his character loosening up. Whether or not, this was deliberate, we will never know. There are some insanely hilarious scenes, too many to ignore. There are a few slow parts, but not too many.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wouldn't even have been good in 3D,"I was really shocked by this flick; I'm not in the least bit prudish, however, the barrage of unnecessary profanity was the only thing that kept me awake...everyone was so unbelievably, defiantly stupid it made me want to move to another country and see if smarter people live there--people who don't make, or like, movies about people like this.The plot concerns an inexplicably successful man (Paul Rudd) with the social skills of someone with severe mental challenges nearing his wedding date. Through a series of contrivances so obvious even our numb-nuts hero would figure them out, he deduces that he needs male friends. Enter Jason Segel, resident guru in all things masculine, who proves he's a man by letting his little dog evacuate its bowels on Venice Beach and doesn't clean it up, hyuck hyuck. Of course, the two boy-men strike up a ""bromance,"" (with ""jamming"" to 80's cliché band Rush replacing sexual intercourse in an endless and unfunny montage where the two actors were obviously allowed free reign to improv and the editor had to try to piece something together from the slim pickin's) and all sorts of gay-ish situations and complications arise that illustrate that, gee, if a guy has a relationship with a guy, in SOME ways it's almost like a guy having a relationship with a girl! Dude! No way, man! Gee, I wonder if everything will turn out all right in the end or not?If you had any fears that things were not going to work out in this story, indeed, if you have any doubts at all about where the plot goes from there, this movie is ideal for you. It takes place in ""romantic comedy"" land, which bears little resemblance to the earth most of us inhabit, and everyone talks like they're on a TV sitcom, with their amusing lines prepared for them. The idea that a character as stupid and dull as the one Paul Rudd plays could have a girlfriend at all, let alone a job selling multi-million dollar houses for celebrities, further proves the theory that Americans are, and have been for some time, fascinated with seeing the talentless and dim-witted in the media. Where once we idolized people for being intelligent, skilled and creative we now make heroes out of people who fart and puke on each other, and think it's funny. There must be satisfaction and security to a good many people to see inept fools magnified and glorified on screen. How else to explain the likes of a movie like this, which cost a good deal to make and made a good deal in return?Once upon a time, a ""good story"" involved someone who had to prove his worth in order to attain the things he wanted out of life, usually at great cost, and the satisfaction of watching came from learning that the best rewards in life grow out of hard work and great interpersonal evolution--something that must have been more true then than it is now in the age of reality TV. Today, people apparently want to believe that you can be ignorant, skill-less, short-sighted, utterly self-absorbed and hopelessly lacking in communicative skills, but still be rich and famous and a ""star,"" without really even having to do anything but be the same moron you were yesterday--it's ""the world"" that's wrong and has to change, not the self-entitled individual. And you even get the hot girl.That's what people want to see, or movies/TV shows like this wouldn't be made.Someone I believed I knew and thought I respected handed this ""film"" to me and told me it was hands down the best thing he'd seen all year, perhaps even longer than that. I have no idea what to tell him when I hand it back. I suppose, simply, ""Thanks for the loan and, well, it was great knowing you, sort of.""I wonder how much worse things get from here in the ""comedy"" genre--maybe next, as John Waters sort of predicted, they'll show people eating each others' colostomy bags for laughs, har har...oh wait, didn't the Farrely brothers already do that?",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A heartwarming comedy about friendship,"Wow, I really loved this movie. It is great in so many ways.It tells the story about Peter (Paul Rudd), who is about to get married. However he doesn't have any friends, and because he needs a best man, he starts the search for one. He finally meet Sydney (Jason Segel), his new best friend. It struck me that, in a way, this is a reversed take on the traditional ""romantic comedy"", putting Peter and Sydney's friendship in focus, instead of Peters oncoming wedding. It's an original twist, and it works really good.This isn't just a great drama. It's also a fantastic comedy. There are so many situations in there that will make you smile, laugh, and want to rewind and watch it again. The best thing about this movie is Paul Rudd.

No Love,"I Love You Man, despite a fine premise and sincere comedic overtones, falls flat, a victim of a scattershot script that’s never sure when it wants us to take everyone seriously and as a result never quite finds its way. Paul Rudd stars as a schlub who proposes to his fiancé (Rashida Jones) and then spends half the movie trying to find some guy, any guy, to be his best man, since he’s lacking in buds.Along the way, he finds his new best friend ever in the person of Sydney Fife (Jason Segal), a wacky truth-telling soulmate who slowly begins to pry the hapless Pete away from his betrothed. Hilarity doesn’t quite ensue as much wander around aimlessly and flop down on a beanbag chair.Pete’s a nice guy who has no guy friends at all. (I can sort of relate.) He’s always had girl friends, as opposed to girlfriends. Oh, let’s just call them gal pals. When Zooey asks him who he’s going to have as his best man, though, he’s at a loss. His dad? Nah, his dad’s best friends with Pete’s younger brother (Andy Samberg). Guys at work? Nah, they’re a bunch of go-getting, artificially tanned prima donnas. What about his fencing club? Nah, he doesn’t hang with them. So instead, on the advice of his brother, Pete goes on a series of “man dates” to find his special bro. One of these in particular, played by Thomas Lennon, has a surprise of his own.But sort of by accident, he runs into Sydney, a dude who’s all that. Sydney listens and likes to hang with Pete. It’s sort of like courting a new girlfriend, really. And all of a sudden, Pete’s doing less wedding planning and more gallivanting, which is a word I picked up reading Hardy Boys mysteries. Now he’s going to Rush concerts and jamming on the bass.For the most part, Rudd nails the part of the guy who’s just too awkward to fit in with the other guys. But he’s a little too awkward. One of the running jokes in the film is that Pete just can’t get the hang of new-fangled slang. Like when Syd calls him “Pistol” after Pete Maravich, and Pete can’t come up with anything that’s not completely unfunny. Not even funny in the amusingly cute and dorky way. He’s a classic dweeb, and yet here he is a realtor. (One of his clients, in another amusing gag, is Lou Ferrigno.) Because Pete’s so incredibly awkward, he’s a little hard to root for. If you’re the popular kind (or were back in the day), you feel a little guilty, laughing at Pete’s inadequacies. And if you’re the unpopular kind, you cringe a little, knowing perhaps it’s a bit too dead-on of a portrayal.I also found it a bit difficult to tell where Sydney was coming from. Was he a good guy after all? Could this be a movie where the good guy turns out to be bad but it’s just a woeful misunderstanding? His motives were unclear until the end, when it was too late for me to care. He’s also a little annoying (he has some jumbly logic for not cleaning up after his dog, for instance) and creepy.There are jokes here, mostly at Pete’s expense, and I understand that the movie wanted to be sensitive and meaningful while still being crude and raunchy, but it never found a middle ground to enjoy the best of both worlds. The laughs were good when they were there, but they were so scattershot that they felt like shooting icicles from a handgun. OK, bad simile, but you get the drift.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

A new take on the 'bromance' genre.,"I Love You, Man is a whole new take on the ""bromance"" genre. It shows the 'love' between two men and how they build it up. Before anyone shouts 'Brokeback Mountain', here's the deal: I Love You, Man is about what happens when a ladies man turn out to have no close male friends at all and have to befriend a very testosteroned-up guy just so he could have a best man at his wedding. The movie also shows how he tries out with a few different guys (even a homosexual man, by mistake) before he finally found his true friend.Sounds simple enough. But what really made this movie was not the plot but the realistic dialogues, the funny intended awkward silences throughout and the whole concept of it.The writers and filmmakers did a great job bringing us a not-so-usual romance movie laced with good acting and unfamiliar soundtracks. It doesn't have anything you might expect from a usual Hollywood movie (I'm not going to spoil anything, but I'm sure you get it).Funny man Jason Segel (Peter's new friend, Sydney Fife) did a great job. So did Rashida Jones (Peter's fiancé), Andy Samberg (Peter's gay brother) and the other cast members. But the star of the movie is, obviously, Paul Rudd. He plays Peter Klaven, a nice ladies man, who don't usually drink, who don't really hang out with dudes, and just not good with socializing. He can't even make up nicknames.The jokes are pretty grossed out type (not those 'smart' ones). Some might love it, some may not. But all of them are mildly-amusing, so the movie really doesn't have any dull moments for you to worry bout.All in all, it's a perfect comedy for anyone who just wants to ""chillax"" or just hang out with friends or significant others.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

It Has Lou Ferrigno,"Quite honestly, there's not a whole lot to say about I Love You, Man other than it's funny. Really funny. Even though (to the best of my knowledge) Apatow had nothing to do with the production of this film, it's representative of his usual humor–the pseudo ""true"" behavior of the idiosyncratic, nerdy, 20-to-30 something male. If you enjoyed the likes of Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Knocked Up, this will likely be right up your alley, even though it's admittedly less complex (in terms of the interactions depicted by the relationships featured in the movie) than the latter of the two flicks just mentioned.The plot of I Love You, Man, as just indicated, is easily accessible (and, at times, easily predictable). You, as the viewer, know that at some point there will be a conflict between the developing ""bromance"" between the characters of Peter and Sydney, and you also know that, ultimately, it will be resolved in some way, shape, or form. As with most Hollywood story lines, you can sense the ensuing equilibrium that our protagonist must achieve in order to maintain a peaceful existence.When I reference all of this, it's certainly not to bash I Love You, Man. Quite the contrary. Director John Hamburg is keenly aware of the clichés present here, and makes a decision that a lot of movie-makers just don't seem to have the gumption (or ability) to. He opts to include them only as bare necessities and let the humor take center stage.And the humor is fairly non-stop from start to finish. There's a real sense of authenticity to I Love You, Man, and the quirky inclusions of things like projectile-vomiting, bass-slapping in Sydney's man-cave, and a dog that looks uncannily like Anwar Sadat is the sort of comedy that you'd expect from the cast included here (and, of course, it works extraordinarily well). This is one of those movie-going experiences–like Liam Neeson's latest effort, Taken–where, when referencing the trailers, ""what you see"" is literally ""what you get"". If you're in the mood for a movie that's laid back and consistently hilarious from beginning to end, you can't do much better than I Love You, Man.Oh yeah–did I mention that it also has Lou Ferrigno?",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The lead character is simply annoying and who in their right minds trawls the internet looking for friends?

The hilarity of this film is unbelievable,"I went to see this movie on opening night at 11 o'clock with 6 friends and we bought tickets literally 30 minutes before it started. I'm amazed it wasn't sold out. The hilarity of this film is unbelievable. If anyone says this film is mediocre, don't listen to them. They are undoubtedly wrong. There seems to be a problem with many films like this one where in the trailers or sneak previews and what not, they give away all the big jokes and then when you go to see the movie it's fairly uninteresting and isn't funny anymore because you know the big jokes. But, in this film, the jokes don't stop coming. I literally did not stop laughing in this film once. I didn't even get a chance to sip my water. Me and my three friends were crying by the end of this movie. So many surprise jokes you don't even see coming and Paul Rudd just keeps rolling in the jokes. Jason Segel plays a character you don't usually see, and does it beautifully. The comedic chemistry these two have on screen is phenomenal, they really know how to feed off of each other. The overarching plot line is kind of predictable, but that's not a problem and you don't really think about it because it is SO entertaining. I'm probably going to watch it another 3 times in theaters and cannot wait for the unrated DVD box set that will surely come out.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Funny, but a chick flick!","The movie is very funny, but also not for men to see. This is a chick flick advertised as if anyone would like it. After seeing this movie I would definitely not see it again anytime soon. Not worth the ten bucks to see it on the big screen! The movie does have it's funny parts and gets the laughs but overall is just awkward. This guy is straight but acts gay and that just makes the movie all but weird as he tries to get guy friends through dating. The movie's plot needs some reworking in order for it to be entertaining throughout. The trailer is leading to a movie that is far more funny than it actually is. I would advise renting or waiting until it makes it to television.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
:-),"This was a funny comedy about ""desperate times call for desperate measures."" Paul Rudd is a Realtor who gets engaged and then realizes he has no close male friends to serve as his best man. Upon the suggestion of a co-worker, he goes out on several ""man dates"" before meeting Jason Segel at an open house, whom he befriends and agrees to serve as best man.I think this movie was overall funny throughout. I think Segel's dog was very cute, and Lou Ferigno's role as himself was hilarious. The parts where Rudd and Segel bond were terrific, and my favorite scenes include where people yell at Segel for not ""cleaning up"" after his dog, the L.A. Galax soccer game at one of the ""man dates,"" the best man speech, and a few others.*** out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Bromantic Comedy at it's Best,"I was a fan of Paul Rudd from what I'd seen of him in supporting roles but I was leery to see if he could pull off leading status (this was before I'd seen ROLE MODELS). I knew Jason Segel was good for it from the hilarious FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL and had no worries on his part. Thankfully, when I originally caught this movie in theaters, I was more than satisfied. For those not familiar, the film throws a twist on the over-played romantic comedy, twisting the plot into what's been dubbed a ""bro-mantic"" comedy. Rudd is Peter Klaven, a man who finds himself newly engaged but, having no close male friends, has no Best Man. So, he goes on the hunt, engaging in ""man-dates"" to find the dude to stand by his side for his big event. He comes across Sydney Fife (Segel) and his problems appear solved until his new friendship begins affecting his relationship.Being that this film is a comedy, the important question is: ""Is it funny?"" The answer: very much yes. It turns the concept of a romantic comedy upside-down with the idea of a man searching for a best friend, though all the usual elements are recognizable. The casting is superb. I enjoyed Paul Rudd in this film and he's proved he's got leading star material but I'll admit, his character was so awkward at points that I was embarrassed for him, hah. You can't help but sympathize with a guy who's desperate to find a friend and makes a fool of himself trying to appear cool. Segel was hilarious as Fife, the laid-back ""manly man"", and was a total scene-stealer. Just as impressive as the main cast were the supporters: Thomas Lennon, J.K. Simmons, Andy Samberg, Jon Favreau, Lou Ferrigno...it seems as if the casting department went out of their way to reel in the high-quality comedy.There are times when the plot becomes a bit predictable, but what do you expect? We've seen the plot a million times before. It's the comedic starpower and clever writing that help this funny gem stand out from its predecessors. It's also got plenty of Rush for those classic rock fans out there. This movie is a romantic comedy for men, one we can stomach and be ensured that we'll get plenty of laughs. And yes, it even has a few of those touching moments to keep it authentic. I'd have to rank this movie as one of the funniest of 2009; give it a shot.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Witty but just not funny enough,"Phil's Quick Capsule Review: Damn. You know what I love Paul Rudd and I wanted to love this film but for all it's witty moments (and they are just witty and even they are few and far between) the film never gelled for me, be it a lack of genuine spark between the leads or just the fact that they are both, well, pretty dull. It has it's moments but there are far better comedies out thereIMDb Rating: 5/10Best Bit: The Wedding dinnerBuy, Rent or Borrow: BorrowIf you liked this try: Role Models (8/10); Knocked Up (8/10); Superbad (6/10)Phil Hobden For more reviews like this check out:http://www.mod-life.net/modlife/index_ugly.htm",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Curiosity,"This movie is currently knocking about on the HBO channels, rather like a fill-in for something more useful or entertaining. Set in L.A., it looks very much like a hundred or so other films made for TV recently that center on the ""boy meets girl;boy is a jerk;boy loses girl;boy gets girl back;both wind up in lavish and tear-jerker wedding"" formula. The central premise is such a creaky bromide that it has to depend on mostly decent production values to sustain the viewer's interest over the course of an hour or so with nothing better to watch.One or two further observations are necessary. First, the idea that a young slacker in California real estate these days can lead the kind of life portrayed here is ridiculous on the face of it. Second, the character of the best friend is far too soft in contrast to his hard and cynical observations. And his Venice beach house with its expensive furnishings belie any reasonable assertion of poverty or even semi- poverty.In short, the whole thing smacks of a TV reality-show concept within which a feel-good conclusion results after a series of obvious episodes involving standard clichés handed down from 18th-century Restoration stage comedies.Been there, done that.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Mildly Funny, Frequently Gross, Ultimately Forgettable","""I Love You Man"" is a mildly amusing, mildly gross comedy in the genre of comedies designed to appeal to teenage boys (either in actual chronological age or maturity level.) It's not a stand-out, and is ultimately forgettable. There are episodes of the TV sitcom ""Friends"" that are funnier, better scripted and produced. There are plenty of gross-out jokes based on bodily functions, including those of dogs, speaking naughty words in socially embarrassing ways, and one highly exaggerated vomit scene. There is also the requisite sloppy and shallow sentiment.Jason Segel, who plays the loved man of the title, is in his twenties, and a movie star, and he has man breasts. This trend of fat, slobby guys starring in comedies has got to stop somewhere. I hope Segel, now that he is a star, considers a gym membership.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
the concept sounded funnier than the actually movie,"This movie is about a guy, Peter, that is getting married, but he doesn't have any guy friends. His girl, Zooey, thinks he needs to meet some new guys. So he starts doing that and meets Sydney, a fun guy that he gets along with. Before long Peter is hanging out with Sydney all the time and it becomes apparent that Sydney doesn't have a lot of friends to hang out with because they all have relationships and he is still single. So by the end of the film, Peter thinks he has to ""break up"" with Sydney, but Zooey makes it right in the end at their wedding.A lot of the jokes were dirty, it was sort of funny, but not super funny. I'm sure a lot of 20 year olds would like this, but it doesn't have broad appeal.Paul Rudd was good. He needs to star in more films.FINAL VERDICT: If you like American Pie type movies, then you may like this. It was OK.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

So easy it gets difficult to watch,"The four points I have given to the film go to Jason Segel, the only real source of comedy in the whole film. The rest of it is just watery and senseless.Peter and Zooey are engaged, everything seems perfect: great relationship, great house, great careers, great friend support on her side. The only thing that makes Zooey skeptical is the fact that her boyfriend has no friends. He overhears her and being such a good soul, he makes it his mission to find one. He meets Sydney by chance and the two of them hit it off immediately. Is it going to be too much though?I think the story is ridiculous and the majority of the characters are even worse. Zooey is just spoilt and unbearable, her friends are nymphomaniacs, Peter is such a weak and plain character. I really don't know what happened to Paul Rudd in this film, I normally like him, but he did not communicate much and everything felt akward.The only laughs come from Segel, who is utterly hilarious as usual, apart from the bits where he has to be cheesy too.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't love these men,"After all the positive reviews that this movie is getting, the good IMDb rating, the brown-nosing policy of some people, I think I'm entitled to post my opinion too. And it's not a positive one, or at least not an entirely positive one.The good things include the actors, playing their roles to perfection. Now here's immediately the downside too. The characters lack credibility, and I won't go as far as to blame this on the actors, but then the writers must have been on something when fabricating this. I found it hard to sympathize with any of them, least of all with the BFF. I was a player before, but never to the point of being antipathic towards other people. Be it true that man is an animal, it's even nicer to feel superior to that, which I suppose is what this type of person should go for. He fails.The beginning of the movie was very good and promising, and then something happened. It made me check what time it was, and how long this was still going to last. Not a very good sign, and the nicknaming thing made my stomach turn. The flick picks up towards the end, where some of the credibility is restored, and of course more feel-good moments will help you along.As far as comparison goes, Forgetting Sarah Marshall was way better. A lot of movies are.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Boring and Awkward,"This movie is not funny. It's boring and extremely awkward. None of the jokes made me laugh, in fact it made my friends and I uncomfortable. I love Paul Rudd but wow, this movie is not his best. None of the characters were likeable at all, not even the side characters. This movie really missed the mark. I think it had potential to be funny but it was not. It felt like it was for men and men only. Personally I did not want to watch a bunch of men making dumb jokes and talking about stupid things. Really it was not funny I would say do not waist your time. I almost fell asleep during it. Don't watch.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just A Cool Friendship Movie,"The movie had good story and plotlines, nothing too adventurous tough. The jokes were not too bad, in fact sometimes seems to be forced for the audiences to laugh at. Nothing remarkables enough for the plot or the (punch)lines to make this movie evergreen i guess. Not going into the list of the 'best buddies' film ever personally.The supposed to be awkward in friendship character Peter ""Pistol"" Klaven (Paul Rudd) was not convincing enough to me as a serious moviegoers. The chemistry between him and Sydney Fife (Jason Segel) was 'OK' but nothing much. Between both of them, I gave praise for Mr. Segel for the cool guys performances delivered.I don't know if I'm going to watch this again, even with my best friends.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not what I expected,"I really do like Buddy Movies or Comedy like Grown Ups, Yes Man etc. Usually those can give you a good time. I also expected the same from this movie. This movie has a Buddy Story, but there's also a little love movie in it. So based on the trailer it should be a promising movie. But unfortunately the movie does not reach his full potential. It's not the best performance of Paul Rudd and the Character of Jason Segel which at first seems deep and interesting misses to develop. The movie has a great start with good laughs but after 20 Minutes it can't raise the story any more. The best parts of the movie are the first 15 minutes as well as the last 15 minutes. In between the potential is unused.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just OK for me,"I was hoping for more. I wont re-tell the story like so many others, that stuff is already right here on IMDB to be had.My wife slept through it, although thats not a shocker. I found myself daydreaming. I didn't find any of the characters remarkable in a very positive way. I may have gotten a couple good laughs, but the movie just didn't keep me attached to it...and I CRAVE great comedy.In a world where tradition is often not the norm, a movie about a wedding that must be traditional (for the women of course) where the groom is NOT traditional (having no friends) seems played out already. Its the typical case of, for so many women (or their girlfriends at least), they want their man to be a man, with bro's, etc. Yet always be the gentleman and there when she wants him there, behaving the way she expects. The typical image of an almost impossible guy. This movie essentially proves that.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Light hearted pointless fluff,"Paul Rudd and Jason Segel star in this comedy about a sensitive man seeking a new male friend to be his best man.An all star cast and Paul Rudd is great as ever.

Average,"I Love You, Man almost could be an Apatow production, the qualities and flaws being such similar.The premise is rather catchy and original, and the movie starts pretty well: it's fluid, dynamic, funny, and the scenes flow together well. But after about 45 minutes, the freshness and humour turn gradually into a more serious tone that, while not being totally bad, isn't particularly engaging. The Rudd-Segel duo becomes a bit annoying as the minutes go, their clichés characters and forced scenes not helping to say the least. The script drags and could have easily benefited from a 15 minute cut, a lot of scenes being really heavy and not bringing anything to the story.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another Iffy Paul Rudd Comedy,"A buddy comedy that ranks nowhere near ""Tommy Boy"". I like Paul Rudd. I want to like Jason Segel, but ever since ""Freaks and Geeks"", the guy has consistently underwhelmed me. And it kind of carries over to the rest of this film. It's another comedy with Paul Rudd playing a regular shlupp without a clue, in a situation that I think a lot of guys deal with, that being not having a lot of close guy friends as they mature, unlike Paul's fiancé who has a tight-knit group of girl friends. So he attempts to start a new friendship with Jason, and calamity ensues. Not boring, not especially side-splitting calamity. Has a large cast of funny people, but the movie overall isn't that funny. The DVD features outtakes that were pretty funny though.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Occasionally Hilarious, But Tamer Than it Lets On","When a meek, clean-cut realtor (Paul Rudd, in one of his tamer roles) sets out to select a best man for his upcoming nuptials, it suddenly dawns that his list of male friends is uncomfortably short. His subsequent errand into the best friend dating scene reveals no small number of reinforced stereotypes and awkward, queasy miscommunications. Rudd's an identifiable guy here, particularly for the crowd that doesn't buy into Budweiser brand of masculinity, but he's so thoroughly, maddeningly passive that the puns occasionally feel staged. It's funny, with a few genuine laugh-out-loud moments, but also safe like a sitcom given the green light to tinker with a dirty theme or two and actually wrap up its primary storyline. And, considering the wealth of excellent comedians in the supporting cast, that kind of white-washing leads to a mildly wasted opportunity.",,Anonymous,Romance
