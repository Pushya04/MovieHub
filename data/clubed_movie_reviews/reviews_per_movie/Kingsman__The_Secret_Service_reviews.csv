Not what I was expecting,"I was expecting something in the way of a James Bond spoof having only seen a 30 second trailer, how wrong can you be. Instead I got a crazy, mad, violent, nutty and over the top film. It has a definite Britishness to it, it's a very smart looking production, very well acted, with some jaw dropping fight scenes, the visuals and production values are extremely high. The fights involving Sofia Boutella were just insane, she's particularly good. Some big casting, Colin Firth as always makes the perfect gentleman. It's Samuel L Jackson I particularly enjoyed, he was just so funny. Lots of violence, which if it's not your thing you should avoid. Overall, slick and very funny. The world is saved by a chav!! 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Surprisingly brilliant,"Having really enjoyed/loved 'X Men: First Class' and 'Kick Ass' and being someone who likes a lot of the actors, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' did seem really intriguing.There was the intrepidation of whether it would balance the violence and humour well, whether the violence would feel too much or whether the humour would leave a bad taste in the mouth. Finally watching it, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was surprisingly brilliant. It sends up the spy genre (primarily James Bond), very like 'Kick Ass did with comic books, and does so brilliantly.'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes that gives the film an almost operatic grandeur (like in the fight scene in the church), very cool gadgets, richly coloured lighting and audacious production design. The soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.Vaughn does a fine job directing here. Not just achieving the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing and the characters interesting, but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things like with the opening credits.The film's script is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar and very witty, with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny to hilarious moments. While the action is grim and unflinching (some of it is not for the faintest of hearts) but nail-biting and surprisingly dynamic, the fight scene in the church especially standing out. The story is very clever and absorbing, with incredibly energetic pacing without being too hectic or rushed. The film does deal with the twist well, it could easily have been out-of-place, clichéd or overly silly but it's actually a lot of fun with a touch of humanity injected.'Kingsman: The Secret Service' contains some very memorable characters, including a hench-woman with legs that can kill. It's very well acted too, three of the standouts being Colin Firth, cast against type but doing a phenomenal job (also doing incredibly well in the action), Taron Egerton as an immensely likable main lead and Samuel L. Jackson (though his performance has divided reviewers it seems and understandably), who is clearly having the time of his life as lisping megalomaniac villain Valentine. That is not to dispute Michael Caine, who is more than dependable as a somewhat ambiguous sort of character, and Mark Strong who has a knack of making even weak material interesting, or Sophie Cookson, very fetching though in a slightly underwritten role, and Sofia Boutella who nobody wants to mess with.If there is something that lets 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' down it is the ending with the anal sex. This was the one part of the film that to me came over as really unnecessary and tasteless, also seeming very out of place compared to the rest of the material and it is introduced randomly. The infamous Princess line is pretty offensively perverse as well.All in all, though, a surprisingly brilliant send up that does nearly everything right. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Hilarious! This could be the surprise hit of 2015,"Well folks, that's how it's done. Ever thought MI-6 (note: that's what the British call their secret service) is a club for snobbish, upper class dudes who like to watch paint dry all they long? OK, Bond is kind of cool (I hated the last two, though), but now we finally got a film that takes spy movies to the next level. Not since 'District 9' have I had that feeling during the watching of a film like ""this movie just does everything right"" (by which I mean of course: it plays exactly to MY taste).Compared to this film, every James Bond movie released after 'Licence to Kill' looks like a snore-fest. This is such a kick-ass, ""balls against the wall"" crazy ride that I had to shake my head several times in disbelief during the screening I was invited to. And I actually knew what I was in for. I've seen every film by Matthew Vaughn, but I was not prepared how far he was willing to go with this one. Thought 'Kick-Ass' was pretty crazy? Wait till you see this.One of the key ingredients is the casting of the actors. The well known stars all play against type, which makes this even more unreal. Remember that lame dude who mainly played lame dudes in girlie movies like 'Bridget Jones'? He just won an Oscar for playing the stuttering King of England, and as you will see in 'Kingsman', that Oscar was well deserved: that dude (Colin Firth) can play anything! He's more bad-ass in this than Bond ever was!A word to the wise, though, this film is not for the easily offended or the squeamish. It is a comedy but a very, very violent kind of comedy. And the language alone will shock the MPAA out of their pants. Watch this if you're into films like 'Lock, Stock', 'Kick-Ass', or 'In Bruges' and you'll probably love it - don't bother if you're more into serious films or family friendly comedies. As for me, I had a (bloody) good time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One Of The Funniest And Most Violent Action Films In Years,"I'm going to be honest about this: I like unabashedly violent action films. I'm 42 years old, I'm from Texas and I can take it. Growing up with films like 'Rambo', 'Die Hard', 'The Terminator' and 'Robocop', I can't stand that watered-down ""no-blood-no-swearing"" gutless kiddie fare that is being served as ""action"" these days. I know the real thing when I see it - we used to see it all the time back in the day - and I hardly ever see it anymore.Which brings me to this movie. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was being shown just around the corner from where I live, and because I loved two of director Matthew Vaughn's previous films, 'Layer Cake' and 'Kick-Ass', I naturally took the chance to see it. I had already read some comments from previous screenings that this film was totally bad-ass, and I can now say that's actually putting it mildly. This film is nothing short of bat-shît crazy.Years ago Tarantino said in an interview that he had written a James Bond script and that he would love to direct a Bond film. Sadly, that never happened, but ever since I read that I wondered what an R-rated Bond might be like. I don't know, maybe Matthew Vaughn has read that interview too and saw the potential, because 'Kingsman' is pretty much that: An ultra violent, funny, crazy, foul-mouthed James Bond film (with a little bit of 'Men in Black' and 'Mission Impossible' thrown in). You could say that this is to Bond what 'Game of Thrones' is to 'Lord of the Rings': Where the former can't and dare not go (for marketing and box office reasons), the latter joyfully and gloriously ventures. Dirty and (very black) humor - check. Bad language - check. Gratuitous violence - check. Needless to say, I was thrilled.But it's also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast (Oscar winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine, plus Sam Jackson AND Mark Hamill) and spectacular, over-the-top fight-scenes that in some instances even rival films like 'The Raid' for their sheer visceral intensity. In short, if you're as fed up with lame wannabe Die-Hards and Terminators as I am, go watch this film. Apart from the rare 'John Wick' or 'Equalizer', 'Kingsman' seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless, generic tripe Hollywood tries to pass for action these days. 9 stars for the film and the story, 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did. Average = a perfect 10.EDIT:P.S. I recently stumbled upon an article on the importance of R rated movies. If you're a film fan (especially of films that don't cater to teenagers), you might find it as enlightening as I have:www.the-fanboy-perspective.com/the-importance-of-the-r-rating.html",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Quintessentially British, Hilariously Funny, Brutally Violent","Stylish, brutal and hilarious. 'Kingsman' is an extremely quintessentially British flick full of over-the-top yet hilarious comedy, brutal violence and a quirky image of England. Since James Bond's debut in 1962, a number of films have attempted to reinvent the genre, with films like 'Johnny English', 'Get Smart', 'This Means War' and many more, however, none have come close to displaying the perfect blend like 'Kingsman' has. Matthew Vaughn has become renowned for taking on action-comedy projects, for instance 'Kick-Ass' (which is still stronger than this but only just), and along the way has kept that feel-good British aspect to it that makes our greatest secret agent (James Bond) such an icon. All-in-all 'Kingsman' is a brilliant, well-executed film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Crazy, over-the-top ultra violent fun!!!","I just came back from a pre-screening of 'Kingsman' and let me tell you: if you liked the first Kick-Ass, you are going to LOOOVE this film! I would never have thought that a stiff Brit like Colin Firth could pull off action - but boy, does he whoop ass in this one. I thought the story was rather original (don't know the Comic), it's a bit like an ultra violent James Bond parody. Or better: a crossbreed of Bond and Kick-Ass. Finally an action movie that doesn't use kiddie-gloves. The kid who plays the recruit is also worth mentioning. I've never seen him before but he really nails it. There's a lot of humor in this film, it really doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not overdone. And Sam Jackson finally found something he hasn't done yet. I guess his role was already spoiled a bit in the trailer, but believe me: you haven't seen Jackson in this kind of part before. This is an excellent, over-the-top bloody and sexy film for fans of old-school action films. I give it 10 stars. Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Has its moments but gets way too cruel and vicious,"Gary ""Eggsy"" (Taron Egerton) is a teenager who has no direction in life. His father was part of a secret agency called Kingsman who battle evil undercover. His father was killed when Eggsy was a baby. His fathers mentor Harry (Colin Firth) persuades Eggsy to try out for the Kingsman. Then there's evil Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who has a (pretty stupid) idea for world domination.This has been a hit with critics and audiences seem to like it. However this directors last film was ""Kick-Ass"" which was OK but got way too violent and vicious in the end. This is no exception. The beginning and middle are not bad. Full of action and energy and some excitement. The violence is restrained but really kicks in at the end. As a rule violence doesn't bother me. However this movie seems to take an unhealthy attitude to it. They seem to LOVE showing people being viciously killed or tortured. It's all speeded up so it's like a Looney Tunes on acid so it isn't too upsetting but after a while it wears you down. It got depressing and uncomfortable. Also the movie is far too long. This doesn't have to run over two hours. Worst of all is Jackson. He's TERRIBLE! His OTT performance wasn't funny or amusing--it was just incredibly annoying. And what was with that lisp? Pretty stupid plot too even for a spy spoof.On the positive side the rest of the acting was pretty good. Egerton is a likable main character; Firth is always good; Michael Caine is good also in his too few scenes; Mark Strong is fun as Merlin and Sofia Boutella is interesting as Gazelle. So it does have a lot of action, suspense and violence but it's too much and far too cruel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
ultra-violent Bond-like movie,"Kingsman is a secret spy organization not connected to any government working in the shadows with no rewards and no fame. Arthur (Michael Caine) is the head of the organization. Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is Galahad. He recruits Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who's father once saved his life. Super billionaire villain Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has vicious hench-woman Gazelle and a devastating plan.It's fun, ultra-violent and expertly made. Matthew Vaughn delivers a sharp product. This is more fun than most Bond movies. The action is better than many superhero movies. The church scene is a piece of art. Colin Firth really delivers the needed class. I like Jackson's villain with a speech impediment. It's a fun exciting compelling action adventure from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A great first half but then the pudding is over-egged,"Matthew Vaughn, who's previous films in the director's chair number just four – ""Layer Cake"", ""Stardust"", ""Kick Ass"" and ""X-Men: First Class"" – does not do subtle. But he certainly does do stylish and entertaining. Of his past works Kingsman resembles most closely Kick Ass with its anarchic tone and comic-book violence. This is not surprising given the film is based, as was Kick-Ass, on a new comic book series by Mark Millar (this time with Dave Gibbons).Colin Firth plays Harry Hart (aka Galahad) a member of a secret spy network called Kingsman. Firth is quite outstanding playing a gentleman spy: a role he was born for. When one of their own gets terminated on a mission Harry proposes Eggsy (Taron Egerton), the son of an ex-colleague, to go forward to a lethal form of training to become the replacement Kingsman.While all this is going on, a dastardly plan (that will result in global mayhem) is being plotted by the billionaire Valentine (a completely over-the-top and lisping Samuel L Jackson), ably protected by his female bodyguard (and literally a Blade Runner) Gazelle, played by the strikingly beautiful Algerian actress Sofia Boutella. Will the Kingsmen defeat the dastardly plot in time before the countdown runs out? (You can probably guess, but you'll have fun finding out).Whereas Bond has Universal Exports, Kingsman's ""cover"" organisation is a Saville Row tailor's called Kingsman, giving all of the spies an excuse to wear outrageously fashionable suits.The ""M"" in this network has the codename of Arthur, played with enormous style by Michael Caine, especially in one notable scene where he suddenly slips from his posh Etonian accent into pure East End gangster. The ""Q"" equivalent is played by Vaughn-favourite Mark Strong, for once playing a good guy and playing it very well indeed.It's also great to see, before his Star Wars return, Mark (Luke Skywalker) Hamill playing a global warming expert, who has more that one reason to get a bit hot under the collar.During the heyday of the early Bond films in the 60's a number of spoof films arose: the gratingly erratic Casino Royale (with David Niven) being one, with James Coburn's ""Flint"" movies being a better example. Kingsman is a worthy example of this genre: a film that has its tongue firmly in its cheek, and with a range of nice Bond-references, particularly in regard to the cliché about the villain telling the hero the details of his plot before putting him to an intricate and readily escapable death.I really liked this film from the off. It oozes style from the opening titles onwards and when we move into the extended agent training section Vaughn turns the action knob to 10, showing off the style of newcomer Egerton, who has great charisma and carries the role well particularly when matched with the charming and likable Roxy (a film debut for Sophie Cookson).Unfortunately, in my view, Vaughan and co-screenwriter Jane Goldman can't quite help themselves and turns the action knob to 11 for the second half of the film. A scene of carnage in a church will be too extreme for older or more sensitive viewers, and a gruesome scene to the stirring notes of ""Land of Hope and Glory"", whilst hysterically funny and done purely for laughs, doesn't quite fit with the mood of the film: it channels more ""Mars Attacks!"" than the Bond-spoof that has gone to date. Similarly a good gag with a Swedish princess is pushed a step too far in a final scene. A case of ""less is more"" in this reviewer's book.In summary, well worth watching for a fun Saturday-night cinema trip. My one request to Vaughn is that if there is a Kingsman 2 (which you could certainly see happening) then he maintains enough interest to direct it: I'm not sure I could stand the disappointment of another Kick Ass 2.(If you enjoyed this review, please see the multi-media version together with more reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to subscribe.

Daring Fun with the potential of becoming Iconic,"#Kingsman: The Secret Service is a gentlemen secret spy-society that saves the world from a villain with the help of new recruits ... Don't let this summary fool you, the movie fantastic! It got applause at the end of the preview; for me first time ever in a cinema.Great lines, never laughed this much: Bond with a wink and fresh edge. Plus super shot ""martial art"" action that should make the Matrix jealous. The action has its true Shakespearian/GoTh moments and all supported by cool tech-stuff. Great aspect in this movie is the music, an extra comic dimension. When you see the movie you'll know what I mean. Next too all the clever fun and furious action, it touches on petty crime poverty and home violence. Matthew Vaugh captures the grimness yet doesn't loose it's lightness ... and I like the message: ""a gentlemen is not born, a gentle(wo)men is someone who chooses to be one.""The young gang, like Sophie Cookson, held up well and Taron Egerton established his position in the gang of giants. Colin Firth's aloofness was crowned with a kick-ass bite, Samuel Jackson brings his role back to old fashion comedy, strongly supported by Mark Strong and Michael Caine. It is a big 9,5 - this movie just nailed it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
007 meets Kick-Ass,"Kingsman: The Secret Service marks the third film in a row that director Matthew Vaughn has adapted from a comic book background. His two predeceasing being Kick-Ass (2010) and X-Men: First Class (2011) - which, by all means, were pretty damn good!Over the last few decades, both comic and superhero movies, mostly fall into the easy trap of taking themselves too seriously. Where Vaughn's vision lies, and so-far proved by his former comic adapted films is that they draw a clean balance to where drama and serious character development ends, and cartoonish humour meets, leaving a unique entertainment that stands out.Based on the comic by Mark Millar (who also created Kick-Ass), the film sees a young – no better way to put it – chav, called Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), taken under the wing of Harry Hart (Colin Firth), a spy for her majesty's secret service. With the aid of Michael Caine and Mark Strong, they soon come face-to-face with the villainous Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson); an ego- centric - Steve Jobs-type - billionaire madman (with a lisp), who hates the sight of blood – yet holds a vision of mass biological warfare.Licenced to thrill, Kingsman' is almost a love-letter to the James Bond films – but not too far as a parody, like Austin Powers - but more a homage to the franchise - a 007 meets Kick-Ass, of sorts. At a point, Colin Firth's character, Harry, even mocks the thought by saying 'give me a far-fetched, theoretical plot any day'Fans of Bond and Kick-Ass are certain to love it, as through rollercoasters of action, comedy and espionage, comes a bucket of winks, references and nods to the world of spy movies. Just like the colourful, gadget ridden Bond films of the 1960's, Kingsman is very fun to watch, with 'wham, bam, thank-you ma'am' style of mayhem, one- liners and bonkers soundtrack crazed all over it.The comic the film was based on was already hugely entertaining – in fact, probably the best we have read. Littered with Millar's creative quirkiness and with Vaughn's auteur film-making, has left a stylized-spectacle of ultra-violence.Portraying the lead character of 'Eggsy', Taron Egerton (also in this month's Testament of Youth), proves to be an outstanding newcomer as he brings the character to life with an energizing vibe of a comparing ethic of chav lifestyle vs. gentleman's class.Alongside, and tackling the mentor, come father type role, is Colin Firth, who based on previous filmography alone could easily be classed as Britain's most boring and typecast actor. Until now, the mold romantic films is broken as he picks up a gun and finds an encyclopedia of wit and enters openly new territory. It's Colin Firth like you have never seen before! – and it is bad-ass.Squeezing in with a 15 rating (somehow), Kingsman is never short of violence and its guts and guns galore, when kneecapping; slicing off body parts and explosions become all too familiar. Given the calibre of talent involved, Kingsman' does not fall stereotype and gimmicky like other YA spy adventures like Stormbreaker, or Spy Kids, but instead, a well-deserved mash-up of espionage and true cinematic excitement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Vaughn Supremacy,"It's strange when you consider it, how much the Spy thriller genre has changed and grown because of James Bond, there is not a single Spy movie that is made that isn't and won't be compared to double 'O' seven himself. So I suppose it's no surprise that a film like Kingsman had to be made eventually, so I suppose the reel question is will this make the Sky fall or just be a quantum of nonsense?Say what you like about Mathew Vaughn the man likes his comics. So far out of the 5 films he has directed, 3 were graphic novels first. Kingsman is one of them. The man's like the anti-Zack Snyder, he directs films based off of comics and brings out real issues in them, as opposed to Snyder who directs films based off of graphic novels and ignores any merit or comment on the wider world the books make and just makes HIS movies. I'm happy to say that Kingsman is probably the most fun I will have in a cinema screen this year.As I've already said Spy films get compared to James Bond, so let's begin with that shall we? Kingsman is a film that is both totally unique and its own movie whilst fully embracing its British heritage, the films marketing campaign drew strong comparisons to For Your Eyes Only artwork. The film acknowledges all of those stupid spy clichés in a way which is both knowing and clever, and then it ditches them all. The best example of this I can give is in the opening sequence of the film, there is a glass of whisky, a lot of people die and there isn't a drop of said whiskey spilt, and at that moment Kingsman sticks two fingers up at the past and says ""we're the future"" and from that second onwards Kingsman is its own movie. The film successfully reinvents just about every stereotype imaginable in a spy film.The villain, who is always central in a spy movie, is Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson). Valentine is a megalomaniac who wants world domination, all standard stuff so far, he also has a lisp and is terrified of blood. That's the kind of thing Kingsman does really well, it sets us up with the standard and transforms it to be unique.The film is of course preposterous in the extreme, but I don't care. It was funny, clever, brilliant and unique. Kingsman has so many pro's to it that you can easily overlook the minor short comings, because in the end the film has a baddie who has blades for legs, I mean who doesn't love that?What I like most about Kingsman is that even with all its madness it still manages to have some kind of heart; the entire movie is kind of a think piece on class war and the importance of legacy. The movie has a brain and a soul and it has no problem expressing either, the finale to the parachute problem proves this most for me.I would be remised if I didn't mention something about the cast, let get over the whole ""the obvious people are amazing thing"" and look forward to the new comers Taron Egerton (playing ""Eggsy"") and Sophie Cookson (playing Roxy). These two talents have come from nowhere and broken through the glass ceiling, Cookson and Egerton are stars with one film to their names, and they deserve every single piece of praise that comes to them. Taron is such an unbelievably versatile young man, he can be funny, clever, cool, cocky, brash, physical, confident and insecure all without saying a word or moving a muscle. Also, I loved seeing Jack Davenport on screen again.Kingsman is the film this country needed; it's confident and fun, without being disrespectful or full of nasty. In short, Sic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Vaughn is Let Loose,"People will have interesting reactions to this film. All of Matthew Vaughn's movies have been good, and he was able to push it further with this one. I would call it an action comedy, but there is more of an emphasis on the action than the genre usually has.There are cool POV shots, and it gets you right into the thick of it. It mixes it up with some short moments where it doesn't cut so quickly, as well as a few long takes that are particular nice. The violence and comedy has a guttural component, which a person like me really enjoys, but it will throw some off.The film is a throwback to old spy flicks, while at the same time being a sort of parody. It is humorous throughout. Samuel L. Jackson plays an odd megalomaniac who makes you laugh more than shiver, which goes with the tone of the movie. It is nice to see Samuel L. in the role of a bad guy. I have no doubt that many will enjoy the henchwoman, who has a different element to her. Colin Firth fits in with the particularly suave spying; and, the newcomer playing the protagonist, Taron Egerton, handles both the action and comedy well. Mark Strong is always a good actor for movies with dark humor. It is fun, however those who are sensitive may have trouble enjoying it. It is not a film for everyone, but that makes it better for others. I personally think it is Vaughn's best work.8.75",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
good,"Liked 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' and gave it a 6/10. The acting, particularly by Taron Egerton and Colin Firth, provided some charismatic moments, while the music added to the film's energetic tone. The casting choices were generally good, with strong performances from the ensemble. Cinematography delivered stylish action sequences, and Matthew Vaughn's directing brought a fresh approach to the spy genre. The writing aimed for a blend of humor and action but occasionally leaned too heavily on crude humor and clichés. Its strength lies in its irreverent take on the spy genre and creative action sequences, but it struggled with tonal consistency and character development. Overall, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is an entertaining, if occasionally uneven, spy romp.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Fun Throwback Spy Movie,"Matthew Vaughn is now one of those directors that I can trust. This is my third movie I've seen by him and he still has not disappointed me. I remember when I first saw Kick Ass and was blown away with how great it is (probably in my top 25).This film is a big shout out (basically) to old spy films. It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.The action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.There really aren't any huge gripes for this movie. The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act.Kingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments. However it all worked because of the smooth editing and well-choreographed scenes along with great acting from the entire cast.

Fast-paced action with loads of humor- Awesome!!!,"I had the privilege of seeing this at an advanced screening and I was already looking forward to seeing this film and it exceeded all my expectations. Knowing that this film was directed by Matthew Vaughn(Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class) I had a pretty good idea that this film was going to be really good. If you love fast-paced, stylish, humorous, and all around awesome flicks, then this is a definite must see! The action was amazing and I really loved watching Colin Firth kick some ass! Samuel L. Jackson was very fun to watch as a villain as well. I don't think I've had that much fun watching a film in a really long time. The way the creators put a different spin on the superhero genre in Kick-Ass, was very much how they put a spin on the Spy movie genre in Kingsman: The Secret Service.

Joyous Utter Craziness,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is the most typical Mark Millar/Matthew Vaughn movie you'll ever get. It has the author's same gratuitous violent content, shallowly depicted intriguing themes and outrageous ideas towards various genres, as well as the director's stylized action scenes and trademark visual quirks. It tackles the same personality and ambition from the Kick-Ass movies; it speaks the language of the well- known genre while also mocking the worst of it, yet goes hypocritical about its own opinion. And as always, it still offers their classic pleasure by just being pure silly and violent, but then it doesn't gain anything more than that.Just like what they did to superheroes, The Secret Service both pokes fun and shows its affections to the classic elements of the themed genre. Though, the criticism doesn't go any farther than pointing out its clichés and trend by dialogue. It never really tries to transcend anything or prove to be better than what spy movies have done, the film just feels like expressing those opinions. In spite of that, the plot is outright ridiculous, but for the film, it just loves being dumb at those conceits. The movie is clearly contented at throwing away a bunch of fascinating ideas within this world, even at the training scenes where most of their work don't necessarily applied in their actual mission. While it's fun, it never really outcomes anything more than a zany imagination.However, the pacing feels kind of slower than it deserves. This is the type of film that needs a little more momentum to actually live up to its silliness. Maybe at the action scenes, it did, but most of the film has to settle with many things that don't need much of a heavy breathing. It's still entertaining, the characters are easy enough to root for out of their charm, that a simpler pacing would have make things easier to watch.And there's a huge benefit with its style. Matthew Vaughn only has a single aim in his action scenes and that is to be ""Awesome."" Even for a sequence that is meant to look terrible and morally ambiguous, the style still manages to gloss it over with cool camera shots and velocity, which strangely happens to be the best action sequence of the bunch. It's kind of difficult to think if this is appropriate, but then this is a property that should never be taken seriously. There is a lot to like in the cast. It's easy to picture Colin Firth as a classy spy, and he does it perfectly, while adding up a sense of gravity in other parts. Eggsy appears as a generic young protagonist, but it's Taron Egerton's charisma is what made this hero shine. Samuel L. Jackson makes for a fun and mostly amusing villain. And there's always a likable presence in Mark Strong.Kingsman: The Secret Service is self-indulgently fun; so self-indulgent, it tends to sacrifice many of its mundane senses. This is one weird, nerdy fantasy that is easy enough to pleasure comicbook or simply dumb action movie fans. It has style, twisted humor and of course, exciting action. There is nothing else beyond that, though. We just encountered an origin story that has the potential for a new big franchise. We can't fault a film for having an utter joy with itself, it just feels sort of empty. It could have been a little more thoughtful once in a while.And even slightly quicker.

Who said the traditional Bond formula is dead?!!,"I was lucky enough to go to an advanced screening of Kingsman: The Secret Service. Watching the trailer a month ago made me interested to watch this movie since I'm a fan of spy movies especially the 007 movies. The movie is about a young teenager from London called ""Eggsy"" who is chosen by a professional agent from a super secret organisation who call themselves the ""Kingsmen"" to go through the deadliest ""job interview"" to be the next Kingsman spy.That said I must say I was not disappointed. The action is fast-paced and there's a lot of comedy.The movie is sort of like 007 meets Men in Black. The movie obviously parodies the old traditional 007 formula especially of the Roger Moore era but this is done in a good way. Kingsman; The Secret Service reminded me how great the old 007 formula was until it was changed until Daniel Craig's portrayal of the agent. After watching this movie Daniel Craig better take notes because there is a new agent on the block and that is ""Eggsy'.That being said Kingsman: The Secret Service is the best movie of 2015 so far. Don't miss it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Kingsman is just what you would hope for from a modern, British, secret agent flick.","It's got a solid story with strong acting and a great cast. It has good humour, plenty of violence, bad language, stunning cinematography and perfect pacing. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn't enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation.First off, the casting and character selection is very impressive, Colin Firth in particular shows us again his splendid acting abilities. He is the perfect choice for the role he played, in my opinion. The lead character, who the story focuses around - Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton), does a good job playing his character, although I personally found him very irritating. He plays a young chavvy youth, making the transition from street kid to secret agent. He brings the urban language, attitude and temperament to the service which is very out of place but necessary for the story. Samuel L Jackson plays the bad guy very well. The quirkiness and style portrayed is fun to see and fits the style of the movie well. Michael Caine, Mark Strong and all the other supporting cast don't feel out of place (if not a little stereotypical from some of them), they still do a notable job.It is refreshing to see a movie of this genre so well made with a strong cast, not hold back when it comes to violence. The violence in the movie is one of the most inspiring aspects, it isn't over the top and you never feel like it has gone 'too far' but it is certainly more graphic than your average mainstream movie of this genre. There is a church scene in particular which stands out for me, it has a perfectly choreographed, one camera shot, fluid moving scene which is simply perfect. It's violent, with some surprisingly fresh martial arts and a cool choice of music to go with it!Kingsman: The Secret Service is different to your usual run of the mill spy movie. It's hard to explain until you watch it, but it's got a certain spin on it, it's quirky, funny and makes many references to other spy movies and how this is a parody. Not in the sense of Austin Powers but it does make tongue in cheek references to James Bond, with some striking similarities. It has style, a fun and quirk edge and it is beautifully made with a plausible run time of just under 2 hours. Believe the hype and give this movie a watch. It's definitely worth your time!8/10P.S. The outrage that seems to have swept the internet over the very last scene (so much so, that some versions of this movie have the scene removed) is nothing short of ridiculous. It's political correctness gone mad.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not that Kind of Tailoring,"From time to time in these comments, I remark on my surprise at how sophisticated young viewers are, and how they demand ever more complex and subtle self-referential folds. It gives me pleasure to realize that my flower children cohort were and still are largely incapable of this level of abstraction. It gives me hope for the future because introspective abstract reasoning is the central factor in reasoning about the world.Then again, from time to time, the nearly suicidal revelation appears that these kids have lost much of what we knew, learned at great cost. We knew that governments shouldn't spy and torture; that women deserve level humanity; that death is not comic. We knew that feeding stereotypes, especially those of blacks, can be fun only when we know the game. We knew this, and still do.I was patient enough with the excess until the church massacre. After all, I liked Kick-ass and Layer Cake. These had a different balance: yes, they were comic-influenced compositions of set pieces; yes they shamelessly exploited stereotypes and had unexpected nonchalant pleasure in the violence. But they placed the audience and filmmaker outside the film.Here, the opposite is emphasized. This is not Bond or Bourne. No, it is not that kind of movie we are told. It is Bauer, who would shoot the dog after abusing it.After the church scene, I felt myself tumbling into a dead future. Who would tolerate this? Who would enjoy it?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Entertaining with great twists,"Kingsman: The Secret Service with one call as Estate Eggsy (Taron Egerton) calls in a favor from Harry Hart (Colin Firth), an old associate of his father. Hart initiates Eggsy into the Kingsman, a privately operated secret service and, in the course of his training, they both run afoul of evil billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who, of course, has a nefarious scheme that needs thwarting.The film has one subtitle too many, and it takes that approach to everything: excess in moderation. Its attention to detail is impressive without being overly meta: only Hart and Valentine acknowledge their debt to classic Bond films, and nobody feels the need to comment on the overkill of an evil lair that seems like it could have been airlifted straight from You Only Live Twice. As a rewatch 03/12/22' opinions remain same. Very fun entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best Action Film I've Seen Yet,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is such a silly film, but it embraces that and, out of that, creates one of the most fun and entertaining action films yet.Part of the reason why I'm giving this film 10 stars is that it contains perhaps the greatest action sequence I've ever seen in any film. I'm still absolutely stunned by how the scene was executed, and I saw the film more than three months ago; I assure anyone that the action sequences are unlike anything they've ever seen before. The careful camera-work, the choreography, the high-octane music, EVERYTHING fits so well to create the ultimate violent action sequence. I mustn't spoil it.The other reasons I enjoyed the film follows: Colin Firth takes on the role as Harry Hart, a member of an international spy organization dedicated to protecting peace in the world. Firth takes on the role with enough seriousness and heart (Hart) to make the film engaging and fun. He steals every scene he is in, and his action sequences are the best ones in the film, but I'll get to that later.Newcomer Taron Egerton plays the new recruit Eggsy, a rebel with a lot of heart and dedication to his family and friends. Egerton makes him instantly likable as the lead and spawns the right emotions to help the audience almost instantly know his feelings and the tone of the film.The story overall is a typical formulaic spy plot, though Vaughn adds some more contemporary and ideological elements and twists (that have taken popularity with superhero films lately) into it to make the film more different and exciting from the stereotype James Bond films.Overall, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a roller coaster of a film, that seems to pick up and slow down at the perfect moments. The story is fun and dynamic, and the action is impeccable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I was right about this film ...,"This another one of those action flicks....With one man army who has a few too many fight scenes, with groups of people, pulling off impossible tricks (eg bouncing a cue ball off the wall to hit someone in the back of the head), without ever breaking a sweat or missing a strike, and who doesn't get hurt.Of course, with it's stunts, violence, unbelievable scenarios, bizarre villains, and comic relief, the young people will rave about it. It reminded me a lot of Stormbreaker.

Funny Entertainment,"The agent Harry ""Galahad"" Hart (Colin Firth) from the Kingsman Secret Service helps the troublemaker Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton), who is the son of an agent that saved the lives of Harry and his team sacrificing himself seventeen years ago. Harry invites Eggsy to be candidate to the vacancy of a new agent in the agency and he is trained by Agent Merlin (Mark Strong) and competes with other candidates. Meanwhile, the Kingsmen investigate the industrialist Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), who is an insane genius of technology that is plotting a deadly plan with his assistant Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) to save Earth from global warming eliminating most of the population with a chip and saving only those that he has chosen.""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a funny entertainment with a violent story of a secret service agency in London. The plot is a sort of parody to the James Bond movies in a Quentin Tarantino style. Colin Firth is hilarious but Samuel L. Jackson is annoying with the weird whisper in the way of speaking.

A Funny Thing Happened on the way to this review,"True story. I saw the film in August 2015 just after catching President Obama's speech to the nation on the evils of Global Warming and his ""plan"" to save the planet. And although I usually try to avoid sinking into states of Deep Irony I could not help but notice how similar that speech was to Sam Jackson's in this film when he explains his own unique view on saving the planet... just saying...The film itself: Is what I have called in the past a ""bumblebee"" movie in that on paper it should not work, but wow in real life it does.The ultimate iteration of the 1960s pseudo spy thrillers (OUR MAN FLINT) with the perennially overexposed Sam Jackson doing yet another variation of his character in UNBREAKABLE and in fact he did a better job in the earlier film.Yet the production values are so sharp, so superb, so technically perfect that, with a tight script and great acting, the whole thing works a treat and may possibly be one of the most entertaining films of the decade",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Sporadically entertaining.,"I like Mark Millar's body of work. I loved The Ultimates 1 & 2, Civil War, Wanted, Kick-Ass, and Nemesis. I never really read of Kingsman, nor did I hear about it until I saw the first trailer.With that being said this film was okay, decent fun.I didn't particularly find the beginning interesting, despite some stylish opening credits. I found that the film really took its time to get started and it took too long to get everything set up. But there are a lot of moments that really kept me involved. In particular Samuel L. Jackson as Richmond Valentine and Colin Firth as Harry Hart/Galahad.Firth kept me emotionally involved in the film as his character bonds with Taron Egerton's Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin. Not to mention he is a complete badass. As for Jackson, he surprised me the most. When I first heard about the casting of Samuel L. Jackson, I thought putting him within this cast felt a little force, and I thought this was going to be another ""typical Samuel L. Jackson performance."" But to my surprise he was very intriguing to watch. He was a clam, sensitive, and for a lack of a better word, a soft villain, but with an ultimate goal. His character also had a lisp and a swagger to him that was a charm to watch on screen.Taron Egerton is pretty good here too. He's got chops to hold his own against Firth, Jackson, Strong, and even Michael Cain, who has a small role. His comedic timing is very spot on and has some humorous dialog. He was very good in the role, but he doesn't shine until the last act of the film. Here is where he shows that he's a very capable action star, something director Matthew Vaughn is very capable of showcasing, i.e. Chloe Moretz(Kick-Ass). He also shares a nice, but kinda useless friendship/romance banter with Roxy portrayed by Sophie Cookson. Mark Strong as Merlin is also great here too.This film also shows off that Matthew Vaughn flare. The action sequences are fantastic and well shot. There is one particular scene in the church that may turn some people off, but one can't deny that it was pulled off with style. At times the film can be hard to follow. I finally understood Valentine's motive and plan in-between the middle and final act, and some bland and boring spots here in there. But Kingsman is very self-aware of other spy movie clichés, filled with stylish action, solid performances and a decent amount of laughs that will pleasantly kill off two hours of your time.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
My favorite spy movie of 2014,"Kingsman , follows an elite team of spies appointed in order to stop crisis around the world and the recruitment in to their ranks of Exjy ,who as all hero journey go becomes awesome and kicks ass. This time the villain that the agency has to stop is Samuel E, Jackshon ,who is a billionaire Eco-terrorist who has as goal to kill a respectable present of the world population, something like the Nick Fury turns bad and he is hilarious!As for the action, is extreme well choreograph, the stunts, the gore, the kills are so well make that is like the comic book ,tha this series is based came to life. What I loved was that all these agents, huntsmen (and women) are in love with spy movies and they brag about it. Everyone from Austin Power to Borne and the granddaddy of them all (possible that is true;)) James Bond are mentioned both as role model and poking fun to some of the plots holes that they have in their stories.The dialogues are also very well written (I suspect Tarantino has put his hands in to that) and the changing between the polite British tone and the ripped fire cursing made me laugh my ass off. The great result must be from the fact that everyone must had a blush working their and it was apparent to the way the characters were reacting to their environment (bonus fact to work their ,you could work beside Mark Hamil himself!).In the end is a enjoyable spy film ,with elements of spoof films of old and I recommended to all, just make sure that in the company you don't have a person with a wick stomach, did I mention the gore? Yes ,I did so do squirms people aloud!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"It's loud and occasionally senseless, but one can't fault Kingsman for not having class. After all, looking good is half the battle.","The movie practically makes a case for itself. It's every bit as outrageous and bizarre as old Bond movies with equally colorful outlandish characters. It uses anticipation of gritty spy movies made in recent decade, then unapologetically opts for much more eccentric route, even though some of them are a bit too strange. When all the bullets have been fired and nifty gadgets used, the aftermath might not be sensible, but it will definitely delight.Story revolves around Eggsy (Taron Egerton), a young man who has a less fortunate life. After a few events Harry Hart (Colin Firth) recruits him to join a secret service known as Kingsman out of respect for his fallen father. This may play out similarly to a few other spy movies at the start, but what separates it is the exaggerated antics. It has action theme, but everything is done with lighter candid tone. Egerton is a good cast, as he's new and represents youthful bravado with slight volatile emotion.As the rest of the cast are veteran actors, half of them being dapper British and also Samuel L. Jackson, there's bound to be elegance, especially in the profanity. Mark Strong, Michael Caine and Colin Firth look like they are just having fun, it's fresh to see them beyond their usual somber characters in thrillers or dramas. Props to the character Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), she's as agile as her name suggests. Her character expresses personality a lot through motion and the bionic legs are really nice touch inspired from classic Bond.Choreography is blatantly over-the-top, all with dodging bullets or deflecting them with umbrella. The direction delivers either pleasant yet surprising details or excessive burst of loud explosion, both are done in earnest whimsical nature. Script is very honest, the movie realizes it's better to play to its strength rather than using convoluted gimmick, as it aptly puts it.It's loud and occasionally senseless, but one can't fault Kingsman for not having class.

One of the most entertaining films you'll ever see,"This film was so cool! It's not just a hilarious parody of the spy genre, James Bond in particular, but it's one of the consistently entertaining and thrilling films I've seen in years. With an absolutely enthralling story, that goes beyond just taking the mick out of spy movie clichés, brilliant performances, epic special effects, massively exciting action and absolutely stunning direction, this is a film that lets you be entertained to the max.I'll start with what I thought was the most amazing part of this whole movie: the action. As we've seen in Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class, director Matthew Vaughn knows how to make a properly exciting action sequence, but I've never seen him do it to the extent seen here.Some of the battles in this film go on for up to 5-10 minutes, and whilst I expected that seeing all that violence for so long would be tiring and boring, I was absolutely exhilarated by absolutely every action sequence here, thanks to Vaughn's stunning direction, using the shaky cam to add to the grittiness but still making it clear as day as to what's happening, as well as some fantastic songs to accompany all the action kicking off.But it's not just the action that makes this film so good, the story is absolutely spellbinding too. You'd expect it just to be a send-up of Bond films, and while it does do that a lot (particularly towards the end of the story), there's so much more to be had from the plot here. The first half has very little to do with being a parody, and is on its own an interesting and of course hugely entertaining plot, introducing the wide variety of characters in a unique way and grabbing your attention right from the off.Of course, the whole movie is a comedy as well as an action-packed thrill-ride, and it doesn't disappoint on that front either. Whether it's something hugely sadistic, satirical, clever or just plain stupid, there's a high chance you'll be wetting yourself laughing at what's going on in this film, and although it doesn't impede the story from being as exciting as it is, there's so much laughing to be done for the whole two hours.Meanwhile, the characters and actors are all fantastic. Colin Firth is stunning as the veteran Kingsman agent, whilst Taron Egerton is a hell of a lot of fun as the young protégé. Meanwhile, Samuel L. Jackson does a great job as the insane Bond villain, helped by a scary but still entertaining performance by Sofia Boutella as the Oddjob-ish evil sidekick.Overall, there's no escaping the fact that is one of the most entertaining and exhilarating films you'll see all year, filled with stunning action, direction, performances, plot and comedy, and that's why it gets a 9.2 out of 10 from me.www.themadmovieman.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Entertainer. Period.,"Manners maketh a man. Gentlemen are always in demand in society, the same way gentlemen spy are in demand for action movie lovers. Inspired by 007, this group of people have set an impeccable standard and taste for foiling plots, saving the world and of course, the state-of-the-art......................suits. (You thought I was gonna say gadgets, didn't you. Ya that too.)First off, let me start with a statutory warning. This genre is not Oscar material nor it is to satisfy everyone's taste bud. If this movie's trailer made you feel weird, it's best if you stay with the Oscar-worthy movies (No offense).Kingsman:The Secret Service ,as the name goes, is a secret organization (not related to any governments) that does what it does best. When a top agent's guilt makes him recruit a hot-head youngster, things get interesting. Meanwhile evil draws a projectile which brings Kingsman into the play.The cast has brought a lot of variety into the movie. Colin Firth (yes, the King from King's Speech) pumps the screen with adrenaline, which is actually unlike him, but enjoyable none-the-less. Michael Caine does what he always does. Samuel Jackson is the icing on cake, with his short-tongued English and allergy to the sight of blood (yes, a villain who can't stand blood) is a fun to watch, right till the end.Michael Caine's lack of character usage is felt , not while watching, but while post-morteming it. Mark Strong is another strong presence.When a middle-eastern-fort starts blowing, the bricks fall down and forms the words of ""20th-century-fox"", it's clear that the movie is all about fun, despite the guns and bloods. The beauty of the movie is that it doesn't try to be something else. It sticks with the fun till the end.An Ex. Sam Jackson shoots a man and starts walking away because he can't stand blood. He, then asks his assistant. Jackson: Is he dead? Assistant: That's what happens when you shoot someone in the head. Feels good, doesn't it. Jackson : No it's feels f**king awful.Sarcastic humors is sprinkled all over. A dog with the name J.B (which Michael Caine abbreviates as James Bond, Jason Bourne), an almost direct reference to Obama, sarcasm on Newspapers too (Look out for the paper cutting on the wall with headlines ""Brad Pitt ate my sandwich"").Bullets, guns, blood dominate the screen which gets gory at times. So, fair warning.This isn't a ""Wanted"" style action movie nor is it Jackie Chan styled. It's somewhere in the middle but makes a mark of its own.You are bound to enjoy it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

C. comics .Hooligan action comedy, the film has a humor similar to Kick Ass and even more spectacular action. A parody of spy movies and James Bond series, dealing with the investigations of Harry Hart, who tries to hunt down a peculiar and dangerous technological genius who is endangering world security. On the other hand, the film shows the unusual tests that the son of the recruit who 17 years ago gave his life for Hart has to go through if he wants to become part of the Kingsman. The plot is a little bit ridiculous , but we're in a spoof action comedy and it is narrated in fast movement ; besides , abound the surprises , being very funny and bemusing . In the film there is suspense , comedy , emotion , action-packed , tongue-in-cheek and chases galore with impressive velocity pursuits. The screenplay is nicely developed as well as characters and the frenetic action united to excellent special effects that are varied of these too . From the beginning until the end the amusement and entertainment is continued .It stars Colin Firth as the implacable but calm agent Harry Hart and the then newcomer and today a world star Taron Egerton playing the badass trainee agent Gary 'Eggy' Price and Samuel L.

"Unique and charming enough, for what it is","This film is above average. Which I do mean as a compliment. I am personally reviewing it lower as I find the gimmick is over quick being british myself, and also how boring the main antagonist is.Aswell, theres a real lack of originality, we've seen almost all of this multiple times before. Every plot development has been done to death. It's rife with stereotypes and cliches.I understand why this happens, studio influence ensuring it's safe and consumable. I get it, you often have to try focus and judge on whatever is new and unique being presented by these sort of films.What I can appreciate is that theres enough charm here to keep you interested on a first watch, which I did in cinema on release. Coming back to it, most of the praise I still have are for the more memorable scenes.But it ultimately struggles to keep you engaged on a repeat viewing.You realise this particular repaint of a tired genre isn't unique enough to warrant a revisit.

Exploding heads, weaponized umbrellas, and logic-defying plot twists pile on until it feels like the filmmakers forgot where to draw the line.

Here are the 2 MAJOR errors which made the movie horrible! (1) There is a scene in the movie with a mother cutting into a bathroom door with a knife. The 2 year old kid who is in the bedroom to be safe from crazed mum is terrified, and screaming. There is no such thing as a 2 year old ""acting"" to be scared. The parents who subjected their child along with the director should be charged with child endangerment. This scene is so disturbing my 17 and 20 year old daughters were disturbed. (2) There is a scene at the end where a princess being saved tells the young leading actor that if he saves the world, that he can have sex with her in her anus. Again my entire family was horrified. This came out of no where. But it didn't stop there. When he was finished saving the world, he went back to her cell where she was held captive and had anal sex with her and left his video glasses on so the secret agent helper could see. They didn't show them have sex, but he went back to room with a glass of wine and the movie ended with a scene of her butt. This literally is how the movie ended. This raunchy no good scene was uncalled for and took everything good in this actors role away. If I could give lower than 1 star I would.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Stylish Reimagining of the Spy Genre,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is a high-octane thrill ride that reinvigorates the spy genre with a fresh and stylish approach. The film opens with a breakneck pace, immediately immersing viewers in a world of espionage and intrigue. The introduction of the Kingsman organization is seamlessly woven into the narrative, establishing a foundation for the complex plot that unfolds.Samuel L. Jackson's charismatic yet menacing villain perfectly counterbalances the refined elegance of Colin Firth's Harry Hart. Their on-screen chemistry is electric, creating a palpable tension that drives the film forward. Taron Egerton's portrayal of the rebellious Eggsy is equally compelling, bringing a youthful energy and relatability to the role. Not to forget Mark Strong's portrayal of the enigmatic trainer, adds depth to the narrative.The film's standout feature is its visually stunning action sequences. Director Matthew Vaughn's innovative approach to choreography and camera work elevates the genre to new heights. The church sequence, in particular, is a masterclass in action filmmaking, blending brutality with ballet-like precision.Beyond the thrilling action, Kingsman also delivers a satisfyingly complex plot with unexpected twists. The film's blend of style, substance and humor creates a truly unforgettable cinematic experienceSum up - Kingsman: The Secret Service is a testament to the power of cinematic storytelling, demonstrating how innovative action sequences and a fresh visual approach can elevate the film's success. The ability to seamlessly blend high-octane action with sharp wit and social commentary, creates a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Nothing I've seen before has been this crazy close to perfect,"I must advocate for everyone, everyone, to watch this movie. I cannot, in 5000 words or less, convey to you how amazing it is and how many different aspect points from the spectrum of the genre it incorporates -- entirely to the benefit of the viewer. If you've seen the viral snippet with Colin Firth in the church, I can tell you that the entire scene is THE ultimate perfection in cinematic history. It is funny, violent, irreverent, violent in a Tarantino sort of way, punny, action wrought with gratuitous violence, oh so wrong, perfectly scripted, amazingly executed (save, I don't know why the lisp), and absolutely NOT what you would expect from a British film of this genre. It's not that kind of movie. I mean it has an unexpected Colin Firth, Commodore Norrington, Mark Hamill, Michael Caine, an unexpected Samuel L. Jackson, and the Princess of Sweden. None of that makes any sense as far as casting, and it's PERFECT. I expect thanks.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"It's stupid, I love it","This film is very stupid. The plot is average, the action sequences are over the top and the CGI is laughably bad.

Good Brit fun action movie,"This is a fun Brit movie. Doesn't take it self too seriously for an espionage movie. The Kingsman organization is a very old secret service and we follow a new recruit as he tries to make the grade with Colin Firth as his bad ass mentor who provides lots of kill thrills. Samuel Jackson is the worst villain in movie history. His lisp and sideways baseball cap is totally ridiculous and he is totally not believable in his roll as the evil anti-hero. And there is no explanation why an American black man is in this British film to begin with. The only explanation that I can think of is it is only to satisfy the film industry's liberal diversity quota. Would have enjoyed it more had they not chosen that path. If Samuel Jackson is in the sequel I probably won't be interested to in watching it. Not because of Samuel Jackson, who is a fine actor, but because he sucks at being a villain and I'm not into racial diversity quotas in movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I wish I had watched this in theaters,"What a fun romp this film was. Oh, sure, it's a typical action film and a lot is predictable and no new ground is broken. However, main character Eggsy is quite likable. Usually characters in this role initially seem unredeemable, but we know he's got what it takes from the start. I guess that's a refreshing change from the usual.It was also fun to see SL Jackson play a very different role than usual. I had to check the trivia section on IMDb to confirm, but I was pretty sure that his lisp in the movie was his own idea. It was.Overall the film manages to have the right balance of comedy and over- the-top action movie violence. It's a great film for an evening you just want to relax and let your mind check out for a while.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
disappointing,"Having just staggered through Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, I perhaps saw ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" at the wrong time. My sisters especially are big fans of Colin Firth so I rented this.The story is about a teen from London (Taron Egerton) called ""Eggsy"" who is chosen to interview as a professional spy for a secret group called the Kingsmen. They eliminate applicants during the ""interview"" -- which is actually a series of treacherous attacks, etc. -- until there is one left standing.""Kingsman"" is reminiscent of The Avengers on TV and 007. It has some very funny scenes, particularly toward the end, and clever dialogue throughout.The violence was very cartoon-like, but I still didn't like it and found it too much and too graphic. I admit I'm not a big fan of violence, but I'll put up with it for something like ""The Godfather"" - -- not for this.Lots of explosions and clever spy devices, with good performances by Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, and Egerton. Look for Mark Hamill -- see if you can find him without knowing which character he plays.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fantastic film unexpected 10/10,"Just an easy going movie to watch after the festive frenzy with a fantastic soundtrack as well gets my vote 10/10. Lots of stars in the film just can not say enough about it,i am not into these kind of movies really but happened to come across it on Sky Movies as a new added one and thought its worth a watch. Colin Firth is a darling in the film always the English gentleman he did not disappoint and Samuel L Jackson with his lisp was amusing to say the least! overall its not one for the kids but if your having friends round for a few beers its easy going with a few twists and surprises and a little James Bond taking the mickey out of.

Great fun,"Kingsman: The secret service is a thoroughly entertaining movie. It sits somewhere between the Bond movies and the Austin Powers movies in terms of action comedy genre.The film follows the prospects of Eggsy (Taron Eggerton) in his attempts to follow his fathers footsteps into the secret service. Galahad (Colin Firth) is responsible for trying to get Eggsy to join the service. The film succeeds in the area that so many other films fail - you care about the characters! This isn't only true of the lead characters either, it is also true for several of the supporting cast. There are plenty of laughs and a very memorable visual scene towards the end of the film. I guess some of the laughs may be a little vulgar for some peoples tastes, but I thoroughly enjoyed the film!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Could have been great but was awful,"Great premise, great characters well acted, beautifully filmed but the director and writer overdosed on drugs and spewed out this Texas Chain Saw Massacre challenger. Grotesque scenes replaced smart scenes to appeal to the lowest common denominators in our baseless society. They figure if a little blood was good, a bathtub of goo and gore was much better. Tastelessness found a new level in a needless manner. Gutter language is so mindless in its endless repetition that any moron could have written the script. The twists and turns were perfect only to be ruined by more absurdity and obscenity. Too bad. It could have been a great spy fun thriller.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Violent but extremely fun spy adventure,"Kingsman like Kick Ass is a action packed and comedic film from X-men first class director Matthew Vaughn. It is well made and filmed with confidence which is refreshing after a spade of disappointing action films like The Expendables 3, Taken 3 for example. Imagine if Matthew Vaughn was allowed to direct an Expendables. This is a violent film but it is filmed in a manor that is in-between soft core action of again something like Expendables 3 and Graphic action of say something like Robocop making it both accessible to both audiences. The film has been marketed in a way which well respected actors such as Colin Firth, Samuel L Jackson, and Michael Caine are all involved in a comedy / adventure film, which is true, however anyone that has seen Kick Ass will know what is going to happen. I applaud the three above for their involvement in something they would normally not take on, they all give good performances, as well as Matthew Vaughn regular Mark Strong. The two young leads also give good performances, however I think Samuel L Jackson steals the show with strong support from Colin Firth.The film is good fun and deserves all the success I am sure it will receive. 2015 is going to be one hell of a year",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"If you liked ""Kick Ass"", you'll like ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"".","""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" isn't quite what you'd expect having seen how the film has been advertised. But for those who might have read the well-acclaimed 2012 comic that the film is based on and from there may have noticed that the film is bringing back the same duo that bought us ""Kick Ass"" (Matthew Vaughn and Mark Millar), ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" may perhaps prove to be less of a shock. The film is most of all a fun one, well-executed by the man whose influence is prominent in it, Matthew Vaughn, the film's director. But Vaughn's style, as seen in the several action sequences that come to define the film are not all that ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is and the rest of it is relatively generic, poor and boring and definitely stands out in contrast to what I remember ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" for.The film's action sequences are each brilliant with one in particular perhaps being the best I have ever seen, where Colin Firth (playing Harry Hart) cuts and shoots his way through the throats and heads of a group of fire and brimstone American, bigot church-goers. The film's ending is also brilliantly shot, unfolding in front of you like a painting. Some have called this style obnoxious, which I understand, but it fits into what ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is, a film with James Bond archetypes that have been cranked up to about level 100, and that are the complete opposite of the James Bond films we are currently used to.And this is the same for the film's main villain, tech billionaire Richard Valentine (played brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson) who obviously has a phobia of sorts for blood and a lisp. He dresses in a way that is a relief in contrast to the suits I've seen almost every single James Bond villain play in recent times, instead wearing orange, blue or purple baseball caps with matching outfits of course. When I first saw Jackson on screen I couldn't help but burst out laughing.What lets the film down is in what happens when Colin Firth isn't killing everybody in the room. Boring archetypal stuff that is a product of what happens when this James Bond parody is trying to be serious for a moment. Moments like when the film's protagonist, Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by newcomer Taron Egerton) is running down corridors with soldiers chasing after him and miraculously seemingly forgetting how to shoot their guns (I mean this scene is painfully poorly shot). It's these moments I suppose that emphasise how Vaughn is not much a director of actors, but more of action and that is where he succeeds here, as he did in ""Kick Ass"".Ultimately ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a good film, and the average member of the audience my age will come out agreeing with me because of how similar it is to what we saw in ""Kick Ass"", but for the critic that I am slowly becoming several things stood out to me which proved detrimental towards the film's style. However, if you want to see a film that is full of blood and gore with a great soundtrack to keep the pace up, a film that in many ways I found took inspiration from my favourite film of 2014, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", then look no further. You don't need to think and you can just be whisked away by Matthew Vaughn along the corridors of Richard Valentin's base, even though there may be the occasional moment when you find the soldiers aren't shooting at, nor running after you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Almost like a (good) Tarentino take on the Bond series,"This reminds me of what Tarentino would have done with the Bond series similar to what he did with 70's era Kung Fu movies and action flicks but there's a twist: There are many who say that the theme to Kingsman is conservative. It's like Falling Down for James Bond. It's a similar experience to what I had with the Breaking Bad series which is leftist in feel and scope. In Breaking Bad, the implausible scenario is that a schoolteacher and DEA agent ultimately take drug money to help with their medical care because the government has lousy healthcare benefits. That's like saying Obama has to take the bus because the government doesn't provide him any transportation. It's laughable. But despite that leftist premise, I could enjoy that series.By the same token, I get the sense that the audience in the DC region theater were mostly leftist but enjoyed the film despite the tone of the film being one of the most conservative or right wing than I've seen in years.A savvy viewer will find a number of inconsistencies and plot holes but that goes for the Bond films as well. What ""secret spy"" is quick to tell everyone he's a secret spy and sleep around and draw attention to himself? These plot holes are meant to be savored. Working class folks and the upper crust are both portrayed as yobs with a modern twist: NOBODY smokes. Ever. It's refreshing. Remember in the Bond films how everyone puffed away continuously? I hope this becomes a trend that is repeated in later sequels (which there will surely be.)The film appears to have recruited every potential spy and cameo imaginable. Mark Hamill, Michael Caine, Samuel Jackson, Colin Firth among others both pay homage to the Bond style thriller while introducing new elements (Jackson's particular performance is hilarious.)Watching in the theater was surprisingly enjoyable because, not in spite of, the other audience members that made obvious comments during some action sequences but were stunningly silent in others. I could feel their shock and relished it. Vaughn takes violence that had been reduced to pornography in modern Hollywood and gives it a new artistic twist while also knowing when to tone things back a little and introduce suspense.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Pretty good action spy flick,"This was a good fun spy action packed film! Samuel L. Jackson performed wonderfully here, as did his co-star Colin Firth! Michael Caine also gave a commendable performance! I thought the acting was spot on here! I loved the characters also! The action and special effects was pretty good as well. I wasn't a huge fan of some of the more graphic violence, but I was able to overlook it. The overall plot was fun and enjoyable too. This movie was very fun and cool to sit and enjoy with a bag of popcorn! So sit down and enjoy! Oh but FYI: if u don't like profanity or if it offends you, BEWARE!

"A modern unconventional adult, bloody and funny, 007 style movie","I have to say that I was really surprised about this movie. Indeed, I expected the usual 007 agents spies or superhero alike movie with the usual stale recipe, and so I waited to rent it, with no hurry at all but, I was happily wrong.This movie takes the genre and put it in a more modern respectfulness but funny, uncensored and violent way.It twists and distorts the usual clichés in a timely and funny shape, it uses very funny villains, amazing fight bloody hilarious scenes and no stop action. Some people, as me, expected a usual family secret agents movie, but, this is not that and, instead, this is exactly why I liked it. Some viewer have been offended by the bloody scene inside the church, but I found it more fun just because irreverent, bloody funny and completely unexpected. It's a bit like what could be a Tarantino's secret agent film.Of course it is exaggerated in every aspect, a caricature, a cartoon. Of course it is an overly violent film, but, if you take it for what it is - an ADULT comic - and you understand this movie want to be deliberately contemptuous and unconventional, you cannot say it is not perfectly crafted.In spite of all the usual spy agent hero movies, its strong point is that it's outside the box and for this reason unexpected, surprising and entertaining.A flawless in its (new) kind, a modern bloody and funny 007 style movie.9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Spy movie parody elements plus fireworks,"Not your average James Bond spoof, this espionage comedy features characters who acknowledge the Bond franchise and lament the serious turn taken by the series in recent years with less colourful villains and less imaginative plots. At the same time, 'Kingsman' also features a plot deliciously absurd on the level of 'Dr. No' and 'Goldfinger' with a villain set on destroying most of the human population from his glamorous lair in the side of a mountain. The gadgetry on offer also has a zaniness not seen in the Bond franchise since Desmond Llewelyn's heyday as Q. And yet, even with such absurdities in place, the villain's scheme is remarkably relevant to the world today with climate change issues and conservation in mind, and there is a memorable speech in which humankind is compared to a virus slowly destroying Earth. The film is not without its drawbacks; the tone is often uneven as the story constantly flips back and forth from serious to comedic. Samuel L. Jackson also tends to overplay the villain, lisping half the time for no particularly good reason. Colin Firth on the other hand is very, very good as the proper gentleman spy who trains our protagonist; the way he keeps calm and cool all the time offers some of the film's greatest laughs. The action sequences are also noticeably well coordinated and while the heavy carnage has understandably attracted complaints from some, the filmmakers are careful not use bloodshed for bloodshed's sake. Few films (if any) have used fireworks quite the same way as they are used here!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Not too shabby,"Even though the theme of random people becoming spies/agents over night is indeed very worn out, Kingsman does not disappoint. The humor, where there is some, is pretty good but I must say -the close combat scenes were at times poorly directed. The acting was not bad and the villain was very well explained -though some things, like Gazelle for example, I found very unrealistic and far fetched. Samuel L Jackson amazing and the role he played was just perfect for him. The ending was just comical and the plot twists were well thought out though not exactly original. The overuse of swears was a bit annoying but really helped to set the mood sometimes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Awesome on a scale rarely seen,"Why anyone is being overly critical of this film is truly beyond me.This is a representation of everything that is right with film making for the masses.It is funny, action packed, full of special effects, and while it doesn't sometimes follow the laws of physics, and lacks a little continuity, it packs an awesome punch.SOme people are never happy unless they get an art house film. This is not the new James Bond, this is not a Comedy, it is a rip roaring action film with lots to like.The simple fact is that if you weren't a fan of the humor in Kick Ass then you will likely not like this film.Stop poo pooing films that weren't meant to provide the things you were looking for, and start to enjoy them for what they are.There are some stand out one liners, and I have not seen action sequences like this since the Matrix opened my eyes nearly twenty years ago.Colin Firth is awesomeness personified and the woman with the sword legs is the best baddie to pop up in ages :-)Go and see it, you won't be disappointed unless you have a heart of stone, no sense of humour and set out not to like it in the first place.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Surprisingly Enjoyable! 7/10,"Review: For some unknown reason, my expectations for this movie really wasn't that high and I wasn't that impressed with the footage that I had seen on the trailers but now that I've watched it, I am quite impressed. The action scenes were great, especially when Firth was kicking butt in the church and the storyline really wasn't that bad. The transformation of the rude boy to a suit wearing secret agent was also brilliant and I definitely want some of those gadgets. Anyway, the film is about an undercover agency (Kingsman), who are on the hunt for a new spy to join there exclusive intelligence organisation so the individual agents take on an apprentice to train them up. Colin Firth takes on his fellow agents son, who sadly died whilst saving his squad so Firth feels obliged to give his son a chance to join there elite group. Whilst going through training, a billionaire tech genius (Jackson) threatens to take over the world by installing chips into mobile phones and giving them to people for free, so time is not on the agents side. By the time that the training is coming to a close and there are only 2 candidates left, the tech genius starts to cause violence around the world so the agency has no choice but to step in and save the world. I know that it sounds weird, but it's actually quite clever. It has a type of Bond/Mission Impossible flavour which has enough drama and action to keep you entertained from the beginning to the end. I'm usually impressed with Jacksons performances but he didn't seem to fit in this movie. His weird lisp and gangsta clothing was out of place but the other characters were great, especially Colin Firth who had total faith in his apprentice. I also liked Mark Strong, who helped the agents along the way and Michael Caine was a great touch as the head of the elite group. Anyway, I really enjoyed this film and the epic ending was brilliantly put together. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Although this movie cost a hell of a lot of money to make, you can really see were every penny went and it truly deserved the money it made at the box office. Its the first major role from the 25 year old Taron Egerton, who also starred in Testament Of Youth and has a major role in the upcoming Eddie the Eagle movie. Its directed by Matthew Vaughn who brought you Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, Stardust and Layer Cake and you can definitely see traits of Kick-Ass in this movie. The attention to detail is brilliant, especially during the action scenes and he covered many aspects with the cleverly written storyline. I just hope that they can get a cast as good as this, if they come out with a sequel! Anyway, it amazing to think that Samuel L. Jacksons movies have nearly grossed over $4.5 Billion dollars, with the Avengers being his highest earner at $625million. At 66 years old and with Nick Fury, Black Phantom and Tarzan in the pipeline, he truly is the hardest working man in Hollywood.Budget: $81million Worldwide Gross: $405millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/comedy movies about a secret agency who recruits a street kid to save the world from a billionaire, tech expert. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A Mess But A Matthew Vaughn Mess,"After seeing LAYER CAKE all these years ago I was instantly struck that a new and important director called Matthew Vaughn had arrived on the British film making scene and Vaughn was a name to keep an eye out for , same as Danny Boyle was from a decade earlier. Since then Vaughn hasn't made enough films and the ones he has made are entertaining enough mixing black comedy and violent but live up to the cliché of close but no cigar and KINGSMAN continues the Vaughn resume in the Vaughn styleSo what's KINGSMAN about you ask ? How about ""Bond deconstructionist comic book adventure done in a British tongue in cheek style"" ? Maybe not an entirely accurate description but KINGSMAN is a very difficult film to pigeon hole . In feel it's similar in some ways to KICK-ASS but in many ways it isn't similar and I wonder if I mentioned KICK-ASS down to the same production team being responsible for that film ? The story itself revolves a lower working class nobody called Eggsy who lives on a dead end London estate and is recruited by an offshoot of the British secret service to foil the plans of an international villain called Valentine . It's not all that original and the tone of the film isn't entirely successful or consistent but like LAYER CAKE the story itself is a bit of a mess . This is hardly surprising for a film that often veers from meta-fictional Bond or Bourne far fetched globe trotting adventure to a British grief porn kitchen sink drama . What stops it all falling apart is the sense of fun and kinetic energy Vaughn injects in to the film in general and the cast in particular . Any movie that has Firth , Caine and Jackson as the leading lights is worth watching for that reason alone and that trio don't disappoint though Mark Strong's annoying unconvincing Scottish accent is a distraction .We occasionally hear rumours about a big budget silver screen version of DOCTOR WHO and I wonder if Matthew Vaughn would be the natural choice to direct that quirky , unique and uniquely British show ? And some of the plot turns are so far fetched they wouldn't be out of place in DOCTOR WHO . Colin Firth as The Doctor versus Samuel L Jackson as The Master ! Sign me up for a ticket now , though please no swearing and get Russell T Davies to do the screenplay instead of Jane Goldman Regardless of what Vaughn does in the future he's still a name to keep an eye on and here's hoping he's making films for years to come",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The entertainment quotient is super-strong, offering absolutely no dull moments. The action-sequences are simply astonishing (Note the sequence where a fight erupts at a church, its spell-binding). This Spy/Action-Comedy is also high on style & presentation.Jane Goldman & Vaughn's Screenplay is extremely arresting & engrossing.

Cinematography captures every frame, efficiently. Editing is just right. Art & Costume Design are excellent. Visual Effects, also, are superb.Performance-Wise: Colin Firth steals 'Kingsmen: The Secret Service'. He's Magnificent in here, enacting the tough spy agent to sheer perfection.

Kingsman is simple awesome,"So Fifty shades of F***ing Sh*t top this movie at the box office where 50 shades got everything wrong and there's nothing good about it, but Kingsman got a lot of good things to talk about so at the end of the day Kingsman win.The story is about a street-wise punk with a set of fast hands (and a faster mouth), finds himself recruited by an underground spy agency. If he can pass their test, he will be one of the new initiated into their ranks - just a threat from a twisted tech genius threatens the world.Every since the first trailer for this movie came out I already known that this movie was going to be great because Matthew Vaughn directing it and that guy knows how to make a well made film that reminds everyone what good movies are, and that's why these no surprise that this movie was awesome.Kingsman: The Secret Service is a like tribute to good spy films that seem to be serious or not very well made these day, yeah they where cheesy and goof but that's what we remember best from them and this movie was the perfect tribute to that, and a perfect tribute that everybody isn't going to see because everybody is going to see 50 Shades of Rubbish, I just lose faith in humility after that.Matthew Vaughn to me is a director who knows how to direct good action scenes and knows how to entertain the audience, and with this movie he directed this with style and a enough effort to make a bad-ass film, even when his movies mostly flop at the box office it will have a cult following and Kingsman will have a cult following. Nice work Matthew Vaughn.Jack Davenport who is a new star and this is his first big role his every been in and my god was he great in this movie. This is my first time I ever seen this guy act and let me tell you this guy has a bright future a head for him.Now at the first I didn't really thought that Colin Firth kicking ass would work, but after seeing the movie I was wrong..dead wrong. Every time Colin Firth was in a action scenes I bought it because I heard in a article that he did all of his stunts and I got to say he pulled it of brilliantly. His character Harry Hart was the best character in the whole film and every time his on screen he stole the whole film for me.Samuel L. Jackson has the villain was just spot on brilliant, I mean talking about a villain that was fun and freaking hilarious. But at the first I wasn't very sure about the way he talked in the film, he talked like Adam Snadler from WaterBoy, but after a while I got use to it and it worked for his character. These days I feel that Samuel L. Jackson is just filling it in with his new movies, but in this I actually sawed him playing and caring about his character and he knocked it out of the park.This movie probably has one of the best action scene I've seen since...I'm not kidding you here but The Matrix, and that's the Church scene. May god way do I even begin with this, the scene itself was fast paste but I still could see what was going on and that action scene was shot beautifully well and it showed what action should be filmed. So watch when you see the film look out for the Church scene it will not disappoint.Now for problems and I only have some: I got to say that the first couple of minutes of the movie I didn't really get sucked in into the movie that much, but as the movie went along I finally got into it.Overall Kingsman is a movie that deserves more attraction, skip 50 Shade of Whatever and see this movie, trust me this movie is more well made than 50 shades.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"takes a bit to get warmed up but the action fight scenes are full throttle, fun and at times intense","KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE review by: Mike SmithBased upon the acclaimed comic book, this film tells the story of a spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program, just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.This movie is a fun action film; it has a classic 007 feel to it and it points out the stereotypical spy and action movie clichés and how they aren't going to do the same things; it gives the film charm.The cast of Kingsman: The Secret Service is an awesome group of actors. Colin Firth plays the ultimate gentleman spy that all men dream of being at one point or another. Once again Samuel L. Jackson gives us unforgettable character. After a while I couldn't put up with his lisp and he started to remind me of Mike Tyson but Samuel L. Jackson is always worth a watch. Michael Caine plays the leader of the Kingsman. He is rarely on screen but when he is he is intense and mysterious. I'm unformeler with Taron Egerton's work but he was the right choice for the roll. He keeps you interested in the film and he is a good actor. I hope we see him in some north American movies because I thing he'll do well over here. Last but not least I enjoyed seeing the legendary Mark Hamill but when he did his accent it reminded me of his joker voice, but that's not a bad thing.The film takes a bit to get warmed up but the action fight scenes are full throttle, fun and at times intense. Also, the Kingsmen has some light chuckles but what bugged me was the green screen, the CG looked cheap and this film really pushed that it was made for 3D, I'm not a big fan of that.Kingsman: The Secret Service is worth a watch for the awesome cast and fun action scenes but this movie is very forgettable and it takes a bit for it to get warmed up.

Decent attempt at updating classic Bond tropes.,"I went into Kingsman without any knowledge of this movie other than having seen the trailer once and knowing it was leaning towards the corny and cheesy character of the classic Bond movies. A concept that has been tried many times before, but even when done bad still results in pretty fun to watch movies.Kingsman does many things better than Bond spoofs like Austin Powers or the abysmal Johnny English and a large part of that is due to the actors used in this movie. Jackson and Firth play their roles like they should with Jackson being quite hilarious. The main 'teen' actors aren't annoying as well, which was a big relief.Storywise this movie makes as little sense as the more out-there Bond movies. To be honest: I already forgot its plot mostly. Not that it matters: its simply a vehicle for a few pretty big action scenes. One of which, in a church, is quite spectacular.When it comes down to it however, Kingsman doesn't quite offer the thrill of a Bond movie. Worse is the fact that at one point it becomes too reliant (and too self aware) of it's Bond inspiration. To the point of a cringe-worthy joke that involves Bond, Bourne and Bauer being mentioned explicitly. This over abundance of Bond related themes and jokes isn't Kingsman's biggest flaw though. As spectacular and brutal as some action scenes are, they are sometimes nauseating to watch do to annoying camera work and some of the worst CGI I've seen in a major cinema movie in a long time. We rightfully criticize The Hobbit for this, but Kingsman is an even worse offender of bad CGI usage. This more than often gives the brutal action a bit too much of a cartoony, very 'Kick-Ass' feel. It could've been cartoony-Expendable-esque action, instead its Tom and Jerry with blood and bad effects.That's not saying there are no fun moments in this movie. There are quite a few. Taken as a whole however, this movie just didn't deliver. Nor does it proof the classic-Bond formula still works. It's Kick-Ass influences and over the top humor make it a thing of its own; gadgets and women or not. It's simply a high paced, bit too self aware and slapstick-humor variation of some classic spie movie tropes.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Nothing special and fails to impress,"Kingsman is a very unimpressive and dull film. The only things going for this film are the eye candy and good actors (Firth and Samuel L Jackson) that attempt to carry this poor film. It barely passes and is not worth the time.This should be a good film to immature, undeveloped teenagers who are amateur film goers. Otherwise for the rest this should be a bit of a disappointment. Some have even tried to compare or 'link' it to James Bond, this has to be the greatest insult to make this comparison. This film is ions or planets from the acclaimed film series and 007.If you went to watch this film in the theaters you may have a strong case for demanding your money back.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Delightfully fun,"I can't help but deliver a positive review for this movie. After all, anyone with a sense of humor and an appreciation for R-rated comical violence would enjoy this. Director Matthew Vaughn - although he has few films to his name - shows his creative side with Kingsman. The story walks a fine, fragile line between controversial levels of violence and dark humor. Although Kingsman reaches its hands into both of these cookie jars, it manages to maintain that balance while preserving the story.The screenplay is smartly written, and just creative enough to avoid the mundane features of the action genre. By establishing solid character development in several scenes, the audience is kept in the loop, never being conflicted as to whether or not a scene is meant to shock, humor, or please. Perhaps it is the talented casting of Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Mark Strong, and Samuel L. Jackson that makes the ""serious"" scenes serious. There is enough meaningful dialogue between Eggsy and Colin Firth's character that we find a comfortable area with the progression of the story, and are not at the mercy of mindless violence to hold our attention. Nonetheless, Kingsman offers abundant violence that, had creative and fast cinematography not been utilized, would have been nearly unbearable to watch.Crowd-pleasing, comical violence, and an intriguing premise make this movie a type of cross between any 007 film and Kill Bill. As such, any Quentin Tarantino fan will enjoy this movie for its stylistic scenes of excessive violence. It's not difficult at all to take this movie seriously; it doesn't rely on gore or sex. It's a refreshingly original type of fun, which is something that the action/comedy genre could use more of.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
James Bond and Men in Black together just without aliens,"This movie is awesometacular! The movie is about a boy, and his name is Eggsy and it is about one Kingsman finds him because he's father was a former Kingsman and trains him to be a gentlemen spy. I am not going to spoil anything so I don't wanna say anything more. The action is great, the humor is good, the story is awesome and the directing was brilliant! The camera moves so amazing, it catches every action movements that no action movie have ever done like this. It is a movie so exited that my hands where really sweaty. There is some violent scenes but it is awesome. This movie is best on IMAX because there is some really cool scenes. Imagine the best James Bond movie and Men in Black put together to a small team with cool gadgets (and without aliens). Thats for me was almost a dream, and now we are here! This one is my favorite movie and I say that everybody should watch this movie. I highly recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fun action comedy with a couple of grizzly scenes and a Colin Firth full of style and finesse.,"(I don't expect anyone is reading this, since this is the ...426th review posted, but here goes!) This is an over-the-top action movie build on the British style of Roger Moore's 007 and the ""The Avengers"" (TV Series 1961–1969).I can think a couple of actors who might be suitable for the main role but the finesse and elegance of Colin Firth is beyond any criticism and the main reason to see this movie. You might never believed that Firth could pose as an action hero but in the league of 55-65 spy-type assassins gives ...Liam Neeson a run for his money.The direction is stylish too and its main purpose to please the audience. Lots of slo-mo effects, one-vs-100 fighting sequences, sky diving, many many explosions etc. Not the boring type. This movie has good action choreography that becomes even more fun when you see Colin Firth delivering it! The script is overall clever although the premise is common. The wealthy evil mastermind vs. ""a"" British secret service (not MI6), but even that idea has held some sarcasm for itself.With the exception of a couple scenes near the end that are crossing the line to the ridiculous this movie has some emotions too.Overall: Recommended",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Even a surfeit of blood can't tarnish the fun,"Deftly directed by Matthew Vaughn, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a nostalgic throwback to those early Bond days of the 1960s, when just about every other comedy coming out of Hollywood was a spy-movie send-up (""Our Man Flint,"" ""In Like Flint,"" ""The Silencers,"" ""Agent for H.A.R.M."" etc.).This latest addition to the genre, based on the comic book ""The Secret Service"" by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons, tells of a spy agency so secret that even other spy agencies don't know it exists. Kingsman is made up of a cadre of highly trained, dapperly dressed ""gentlemen"" spies who consider themselves to be the descendants - in spirit, if not in flesh-and-blood - of the knights of yore (they've even given each other code names like Lancelot and Galahad). That dapperest of dapper gentlemen Colin Firth plays Harry Hart, aka Galahad, a veteran agent who recruits a directionless youth (Taron Edgerton) from the streets of London - the son of an agent who over a decade earlier saved Hart's life - to train in the art of spying (like in ""My Fair Lady,"" the eager trainee pipes in). Eggsy's first major assignment will be to thwart the dastardly high-tech plot of a crazed gazillionaire, played by a lisping Samuel L. Jackson, who intends to save the planet by eliminating the ""virus"" (i.e., humanity) that seems bent on destroying it.The humor in the Jane Goldman/Matthew Vaughn screenplay ranges from brittle and dry to pitch-dark satire, so dark in fact that the movie occasionally threatens to run off the rails into a tonal train wreck. Luckily, however, it always manages to right itself just at the point where we're about to bail out on it. It's true that the violence may probably be a tad too graphic for a movie of this type but the overall spirit of good cheer and unalloyed fun triumphs in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Devastating Fun,"Matthew Vaughn is someone who clearly enjoys his work and you can see that in every inch of Kingsman: The Secret Service. This is a movie where you can see that entertainment and fun was always put ahead of everything else and as one would assume, this resulted in a film that is both entertaining and fun in a way that many action films don't seem to want to be anymore.One thing that is quite refreshing is how this film never tries to be anything deeper than an action film. Earlier last year I saw The Raid 2 and although that film is far superior to this one it was somewhat irritating when it tried to be a much deeper tale that it was, an element which Kingsman doesn't suffer from. And a predominant chunk of the film's quality comes from how electrifying and ridiculous the film's action sequences are. The camera has incredible pace and Vaughn had the intelligence to maintain single, long, violently energetic shots during the most engrossing action scenes. And it can't be said enough how cool it is to see the cultured and clean Colin Firth beat the sh*t out of people.What makes the tone of the film so memorable is the constant knowledge that the film really doesn't give a crap about what makes sense or what is reasonable and how much it clearly wants you to know that. Every character in this film it basically a exaggerated caricature and they are all the more hilarious for it. The film embodies how cliché it is and in a way it transcends cliché all together because the audience has the constant knowledge that when something dumb happens, the film is laughing at itself just as much as the audience is.I have to say I was somewhat irritated when I heard people calling this movie 'original' as I feel that that is not only an insult to actually original films but insulting to this film itself. Because the true genius of the film is how much perspective it gives us on the action genre. Modern action movies seem to be trying far to hard to be edgy and what this film recognises is that it is far more important to be entertaining than different. It builds itself on the best clichés that classic action has given us and cranked up the levels of ridiculousness to the point where you can't help but just smile your way through the film. It is so wonderfully giving and un-self- indulgent to it's audience which is why it is such a joy.It is a film that is quite hard to criticise seeing as it already seems to be a sort of semi-parody of itself. I did have some problems with some of the characters specifically the female supporting character. When we are first introduced to her they display her as incredibly composed however in later scenes they make her into an incompetent damsel in distress just so that the male lead could act all heroic and comforting (something that seemed out of character for him as well.)Over all this movie achieves basically everything it set out to do. It's fun and thoroughly worth your time. I would never give it higher than an 8 though because it has no real depth to it at all (which is kind of the point of the movie I guess). Go see it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fun with Spies,"Greetings again from the darkness. In 2010, writer/director Matthew Vaughn turned the superhero genre on its ear with the hit Kick-Ass. With this most recent film, he has done the same thing to spy-thrillers. We get the well-tailored look made famous by Roger Moore's James Bond, the fanciful and lethal gadgets from early Bond films, the ever-present umbrella (put to new uses here) of The Avenger's John Steed, and the ultra-suave and debonair manners of Napoleon Solo from The Man from U.N.C.L.E. We get all of that in a surprisingly effective and fun action performance from Colin Firth.Fun is the operative word here. It's clear all parties involved are having a great time, especially Mr Firth going drastically against type. There are two action-packed and pretty humorous (in a demented way) fight scenes. One is early on inside a London pub, and has Firth flashing his particular set of skills against a group of thugs. The other (and even more raucous) fight occurs inside a church and is set to Lynryd Skynyrd's ""Free Bird"". The body count piled up as fast as the guitar licks.As spectacular as the fight scenes are, the real fun here is in the characters. The old guard of the Kingsmen includes Firth as Galahad, Mark Strong as Merlin, Jack Davenport as Lancelot, and Michael Caine as Arthur. This long-standing group is one part international spy, one part Knights of the Round Table  and these gentlemen are extremely well trained and impeccably well dressed. When one of their agents dies on the job, the recruitment boot camp kicks into gear. Made up of a group of relative newcomers to the movie world, the two most interesting are Roxy (Sophie Cookson) and Eggsy (Taron Egerton). Adding to the intrigue, Eggsy is the son of a former Kingsmen, and has some skills that aren't initially apparent.Of course, what would a spy-tribute movie be without a colorful villain? Samuel L Jackson plays lispy megalomaniac Valentine, who has a quick gag reflex when it comes to violence. Fortunately his henchman Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) is equipped with razor sharp leg prosthetics and some ultra-crazy fighting skills. We even see Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold  fans of the Mark Miller/Dave Gibbons graphic novel will appreciate the irony.Firth and Egerton play off each other quite well in the mentor-pupil relationship, and Egerton is clearly set up for the franchise sequels  as is his friend and fellow Kingsman, Ms. Cookson. For those who think the Daniel Craig Bond films are too dark and serious, this provides a flashback to lighter Bond fare (minus the misogyny). Many hot topics are touched on: class warfare, domestic abuse, racism, etc, but mostly this can be taken as a rollicking good time because ""it's not that kind of movie"". It does, however, remind us that ""manners make the man"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Action Packed,Colin Firth,Samuel L. Jackson. How Could You Not Like It!","This movie does not disappoint. Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, I mean seriously,how could you not have a good time in the cinemas watching this! The plot,although it had it's flaws,kept you entertained. Also,Taron Egerton delivered a great performance.The movie is based upon a comic book series,and although it is a comic book based filmed,the action may seem over the top at points. Especially the church scene. Sometimes this ""over the top action"" movies are entertaining to watch,but this movie,in my opinion went to over the top. For instance,as I mentioned before,the church scene. It was not a necessary scene. Sure it was fun to see Colin Firth kick butt,but it didn't need to be as detailed and graphic as it was. But,this scene did not ruin the movie. Samuel L. Jackson played his role perfectly. I promise you,they could not have found a more perfect actor to play this role. He was funny and delivered a great performance. Colin Firth,as always,was great. Taron Egerton always had a great performance. It's always good to see some young good actors with potential.All in all,this film was a great movie,great action,and great acting.

Serviceable,"(Rating: ☆☆ ½ out of 4)  This film is mildly recommended.  In brief: A spy film that is shaky, not stirring.  GRADE: B-  Kingsman: The Secret Service is an homage to the British spy film genre  with its sophisticated agents, wry humor, and gadgetry. It sends up the  Ian Fleming spy films but with a harsher edginess and tons of violence.  Matthew Vaughn directs the film with ample flair and style, but his  screenplay (co-written by Jane Goldman) lacks the right degree of  mindless fun and wit. The plot follows the formula of a megalomaniac  wanting to control the world and a secret agency that is hellbent on  stopping him.  The film is very well cast, with the exception of its villain, who acts  more buffoonish than menacing. Samuel L. Jackson plays him, but the  actor never conveys the wickedness very convincingly. Fortunately, the  other actors contribute greatly to the film's enjoyment. Foremost are  its two leads, Colin Firth who handles the action hero bravado very  well and newcomer Taron Egerton as his willing protégé. Mark Strong,  Michael Caine, and Sofia Boutella as the female Oddjob round out the  ensemble.  Kingsman: The Secret Service entertains, but its high level of non-stop  violence is disturbing, especially in a church scene where the body  count reaches absurd heights and skews the film's lighter tone which  effectively is found in films of this genre. Also, the CGI is  amateurish and cheap looking. Kingsman: The Secret Service is based on  a comic book, but comic is not the correct term in describing this  movie. Serviceable is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Flawless.,"Kingsman is flawless and it's a very special movie because it takes the good old spies and put's humor in it and it is mixed with mind-blowing action scenes with slow-motion and the slow-motion is very well done,it's really slowed but it's still quick,and it's not overused. The main character Eggsy is really relatable because he's normal teenage kid but at the same time he is much more.I think that Taron Egerton was pretty good in this movie.I could imagine him in a lot of other movies. And of course Colin Firth,he is just amazing.In the action scenes he looks amazing.He's just good. The main villain played by Samuel L. Jackson is very original and very funny.Because how many times you see a villain that is scared of blood and tramples on his tongue?That was just hilarious and the humor it self was very Good.I laughed almost every scene which is very good. 10/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Spy film with no clichés.,"Immersive, entertaining, funny, well-acted but forgettable. Words I use to describe my experience with Kingsman.A spy movie that acknowledges the various tropes and clichés often associated with the spy genre and then proceeds to break them with minimal effort and often a frenzy of laughter. As Samuel L. Jackson's character Richmond Valentine and Taron Egerton's Eggsy state, ""It's not that kind of a movie"". Which means no convoluted plots, impossibly smart heroes, wooden and expendable supporting characters or illogical situations (except a few).The latest directorial/scriptwriting/production venture of Matthew Vaughn of X Men First Class and Days of Future Past fame. Sadly, unlike the aforementioned movies as well as Kick-Ass, Kingsman is not as memorable. It fails to find its footing and identity and at every step aspire to illicit the same laughter James Bond does and fails miserably.Kingsman's overarching plot is one of its weaknesses. It's not particularly original and not well thought out either. So are many if the action sequences, but we'll get there later.Valentine drives a hard bargain with a sensible speech. He compares human to a virus on the host, the nature. With the current trend of population growth, it can only lead to two outcomes. Either the host kills the virus or the virus kills the host. But in either case, humans die. Unless someone does something to change that. So, after earning billions, Valentine takes it upon himself to save the human species from extinction. To do so, Valentine proposes a biological weapon. Neurological waves emitted from the SIM card his company will give away for free that trigger the aggression centre of the brain in a bid for humans to kill one another and martyr themselves for the greater good. All the while keeping the influential and powerful safe to be a part of the new world.On the surface it seems A-grade but on going deeper the logic starts to crumble.The true strength lies in the interactions and relations of the characters. The on screen chemistry and the dialogues. They never failed to charm the audience and keep them drawn into the tale of Harry (Colin Firth), Eggsy and the Kingsman's race to save the world.The movie does a fantastic job in being fresh. It outright breaks the various tropes and clichés associated to it. The duration of the movie, I kept on applying the various tropes and clichés to see where the movie would slip up. But sadly, when I walked out, I had a hateful respect towards the movie for being original and insulting my intelligence again and again. No obvious double crossers. The villain not missing the clue that Harry Hart is not a billionaire and instead somebody with a much bigger agenda than that of a billionaire.The lead character, Harry Hart (Colin Firth) having a plot armor giving him a get out of situations free card. The movie outsmarts you at every step.Expanding more on the characters, the movie does an amazing job of handling its characters the movie took its time to build up the characters. While the movie focuses on Harry and Eggsy's relationship for the first half, it sets up other characters, another Kingsman Merlin (Mark Strong) as the cold test taker and Roxy (Sophie Cookson) the eventual latest initiate to the Kingsman so they can take control of the movie in the second half without it becoming too rushed, messy, unfamiliar or awkward.In the opening scene of the movie, Harry Hart a.k.a. Galahad and the rest of the Kingsman are interrogating a Middle Eastern terrorist in a fort in the Middle East. Obviously. The terrorist pulls the pin on the grenade Galahad missed and it costs Lancelot's (another Kingsman) life to save everyone. That Lancelot was Eggsy's father, thus the on screen time and relationship of Harry and Eggsy which led Eggsy to the test to replace the recently fallen Lancelot in a botched rescue mission in the mountains.It would be a crime to not give a special mention to Samuel L.Jackson's performance as Valentine. He acts as the movie's primary villain as well as comic relief. He has a lisp, thinks big, and is a scaredy cat and a joy to watch, all the way till his last scene.Just like the movie does so many good things, it also has its flaws that sadly cannot be overlooked.The action sequences were too long and illogical. The movie always tried to be something else, a sci-fi movie (a woman dodging bullets), too James Bond-sy, a martial arts/karate or Matrix style jumping around. They served no purpose other than 'oooohs' and 'aahhs' from the audience.Another gripe that will detract from the experience is its heavy dependence on stereotypes. Eggsy, single child with abusive stepfather and no aim in life His mother, a victim of low self-esteem. People from Oxford and Cambridge being snobs. Boys being snobby and unfriendly.All in all, though, Kingsman is one of the most well-paced spy films that has its moments and deserves a watch, well because it is fun and forgettable.Rating: 3/4",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Taron Egerton held his own, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of his work.The plot was simple, IMO, but well executed so it didn't feel boring or predictable.I wanted to get technical but it was...

An honest action film,Kingsman: The Secret Service is an excellent piece of modern film work. This movie uses the typical mentor/apprentice formula but puts a modern English twist on it. Although very different from Kick-ass (story wise) Matthew Vaughn does use his personalized style of stylized violence and epic explosive scenes. From watching the film it was very clear that this movie was made by the director of Kick ass. Similarly to Kick ass this movie takes a realistic look at an idea and puts it in a comical action movie which works extremely well.In general this film is another look on the gentleman spy concept. The film plays with the idea of two people from different backgrounds united to defeat a common foe. Although I was not a fan of the loss of a main character I can see why this was done however I have no idea if this was included in the original comic that this film was based off.I would rate this film as an eight out of ten because it displays fantastic acting and film work.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Immense Entertainment, really Nothing Like it,","Kingsman: The Secret Service is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It is a very fun ride, completely enjoyable from start to finish, jam packed with great action sequences, sincere hilarity and outstanding characters.The movie is very original, there truly is not, nor do I think there ever will be, a film quite like it. It's certainly a parody of the spy genre but in a very different way, it's not quite like Naked Gun or Austin Powers, it's more of a tribute to old fashioned spy films, like the Roger Moore Bonds.The cast is fantastic, and as this is a Matthew Vaughn (easily one of the most talented directors in Hollywood) film, there are many actors in unexpected roles. Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson have never done anything like this before,. Firth is the slick, skillful super spy and Jackson is the main villain who also provides a lot of comic relief, you would not expect to see them in these roles, but they completely own them nonetheless.Matthew Vaughn also likes getting very small actors in the main role, and he made a great choice with Taron Egerton, a talented young actor who suited the role of Eggsy perfectly, and I hope to see more of him in the future. A hilarious, action packed breath of fresh air, Kingsman brought a smile to my face throughout and I am so happy a film this insane exists, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy.A spy organisation recruits a young man with little skill but a lot of promise, meanwhile, an evil genius plots to take over the world with a new smart phone.Best Performance: Colin Firth",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Not all of it works, but the bits that did were very funny and there were definitely more hits than misses","Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton) has gone off the rails since the untimely demise of his father who was working for Kingspan at the time. After getting in trouble with the police, Gary remembers an important number that he can ring at any time he needs it and after ringing this number he is released from prison and becomes friends with Harry Hart (Colin Firth) who is one of the heads of the Kingspan organisation. Harry gives Gary the opportunity to make something of himself and make his father proud of him by joining this secret organisation. but has Gary got what it takes to make him succeed?Yeah I'm prepared to except that this was a little clichéd at the start; a young man has gone off the rails and needs a bit of direction in life, but the way that this aspect of the plot is developed is very well executed. You just can't beat a true gentleman actor like Colin Firth beating up a load of chavs and then returning to his unfinished pint of Guinness. It's wonderfully pompous, but also very insightful at the same time which is a very hard trick to pull off. We then witness a marine core training regime which again in the wrong hands could have come across as boring or dull, but again there is a requisite amount of fun injected in to proceedings, but then we're reminded of the seriousness of the requirements of the Kingspan Service. It works well because it shows the serious nature of the training, but also manages to make light of it at the appropriate moments.The performances across the board are roundly good; Firth does a pompous uppity toff like no other, Caine is Caine and basically phones it in (although Caine phoning it in is still better than watching most other actors trying). Egerton is the star of this show who is an interesting actor - he can play the cockney chav well, but is also surprisingly effective outside of this cliché - he kind of reminded me of Jack O'Connell. Again Geoff Bell is Geoff Bell and is a very much one note actor, but he plays that note very well and is excellent here.Kingsman isn't an obvious and goofy spoof in the way that Johnny English, or Get Smart is (the eventual agents aren't bumbling or inept, but with Kingsman it has more subtle nods and winks to the genre and it was these subtle nods and winks that really had me laughing - the war room scene from Dr Strangelove and the obvious parody of The Spy Who Loved Me towards the end). This is where the film was at its strongest.The only weak aspect of this film lay with Samuel L Jackson as a villain and the entire sub-plot; for starters as much as I like Samuel L Jackson as an actor I could not take to him as a villain here - he wasn't intimidating or funny and that stupid lisp started to get on my nerves after a while. Although his involvement in the story makes sense towards the end, it was a little bit dull for the majority of the running time leaving it up to the rest of the principal cast to keep things moving which thankfully they manage to do with relative ease.Thankfully, more of this works than doesn't and it has enough set-pieces and action sequences to make this an enjoyable picture. Yes it's not entirely successful over its full 120 minutes running time, but it kept me laughing consistently and also had enough heart to it to make you care about the characters all round.

Very good - could've been so much better,"I won't go into all of the details that so many others have, I'll just give my overall opinion of the movie.Frankly, this was one of those movies where it felt like the producer and director weren't entirely sure where they wanted to go with it. Is it a comedy, is it a drama, action pic, etc? I'm not sure they knew.In the end, it felt to me like it was lacking so much, and what was lacking they tried to make up for with over-the-top extras which didn't add to the movie in the slightest.Yes, it was an ""R"" movie, but when the language ... seriously? It didn't add to the movie at all (took away from Jackson's character with me), and just was overbearing. Add to it the absolutely idiotic sex scene at the end (was she really that pathetic?) and it felt like they didn't know how to end it.The comedic death sequences seemed extremely childish as well. Maybe they were aiming for a particular target audience ... but the ""R"" rating cuts down on the number of 15- and 16-year-olds in the theater.The group I was with when I saw the movie all said the same thing - if you're going to have that over-the-top profanity and the gratuitous sex bits at the end, at least spend a moment or two reviewing it so that it adds to the movie and doesn't detract from it.Without those, this would've been a much better flick in our opinion, worthy of the mid-8's. Instead, a solid 7 for us.Just my opinion in the end, though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Rings all the right chords,"Its a spy movie with great action sequences, fair bit of violence, lots of amazing gadgets, a far fetched villain plot and ""men in suits"" with impeccable manners - In the divine rule book of spy movies, this movie hits all the right chords. And it has a few more things to add as well - such as great humour, parkour and some divergence from general clichés.Honestly, I believe before they release the next bond film, they should sit together and watch this film and learn from it. The recent bond films have all been about action and no gadgets, but they have lost all the fun elements. Kingsman is the new bond and I do hope they bring out a sequel which is as good if not better.Now the bad..... well... I dunno. True its not one of the great films of all time. But it really is fun to watch. So much fun in fact that you will fail to notice any flaws.So go ahead and watch it... NOW!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""Manners Maketh Man""","Kingsman: The Secret Service is the kind of movie that you watch when you just want to have a good time.With all the Super Hero movies coming out it is nice to see a movie that takes a bit of the super natural and brings it down to Earth. It takes the Spy genre and makes it something that the audience can relate to. The film tics all the boxes on bigger than life issues with the world at stake, a super villain who's hand hovers over the detonation of it, and a group that acts above the law, with the good of the world at mind, to stop it.However, what makes this film truly a gem in the genre of Action/Comedy is the relationship between Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and the rest of the cast. He goes through the character arch of a young man trying to find his place in the world. He uses his surroundings to explain his failures, but when given the chance to prove himself he strives to make his mark.The film does well to keep you entertained with a main character having a different perspective on an environment than the people he's with. The action is top notch with gadgets and fighting scenes. Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman (Kick Ass, Stardust) have scripted another outside of the box film that is clever and entertains.If you're looking for a film that above all else entertains; and, is well written, with a good plot and strong characters take a try on Kingsman and watch how ""Manners Maketh Man"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Are we going to stand here talking, or are we going to fight?","The recipe for movie success; Take 1 part Ipcress File, 1 part Austin Powers, a dollop of Bond -- the Pierce Brosnan Bond, and a smidgeon of Charade; then blend, fold, and spindle in equal parts of The Manchurian Candidate and Arabesque. Cook over high heat for 2 1/2 hours, and watch your audiences come back for a second viewing. Make the villain a science fiction, black computer nerd billionaire -- a grown-up Urkel/Blankman if you will -- for the icing on the cake. Kingsman pushes all the right buttons for aficionados of 60s action/spy thrillers with all the up- to-date hilarity of Austin Powers. There's never a dull moment here.This amazing film moves with the pacing of a Bond flick, and not without good reason. Political correctness spells doom for the Bond franchise as we know it, so this will be a series that can be milked for at least 20 sequels, and I will be sure to watch all of them.

Does To James Bond What Kickass Did To Superheroes!,"From the director of Kickass & X-Men: First Class comes a new comic book adaptation that effortlessly blends the over-the-top action of the former with the secret world of the latter, which is then smoothly intermixed with elements of spy-thrillers & is ultimately raised to a high level of bizarro. And the result is an incredibly stylish, downright hilarious & endlessly fun cinema called Kingsman: The Secret Service.Based on the acclaimed comic book, Kingsman: The Secret Service refers to a secret spy organisation that's looking to recruit a potential agent as a replacement for the position left vacated by a former Kingsman who dies during one of their operations. The story follows a veteran Kingsman agent who takes an aimless young adult under his wing & grooms him for the job while a twisted billionaire unleashes a global threat.Co-written, co-produced & directed by Matthew Vaughn, whose kinetic direction here brims with creative energy as his latest is his love letter to earlier James Bond classics. However, it also toys with the conventions of its genre & makes fun of the same simultaneously, and with its clever use of violence, outlandish humour & a few cartoonish renderings, makes this film a roller-coaster ride of emotions.Coming to the technical aspects, Production Design team does an excellent job as all the set pieces are meticulously refined. Cinematography makes excellent use of camera that seamlessly switches from a firmly controlled sequence to an out-of-control carnage without ever losing focus. Editing briskly paces the whole narrative. Plus, the energetic soundtrack by Henry Jackman & Matthew Margeson works in the film's favour.As far as performances go, Kingsman: The Secret Service features a well-rounded cast in Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Strong, Taron Egerton & others. Now Firth may not be anyone's first choice for an action role yet it's the exact reason why his character works so well. Jackson is funny & freaky at the same time. Strong is reliable as always. Egerton is the newcomer here who exhibits great potential & his master-disciple relationship with Firth is a highlight of this feature.On an overall scale, Kingsman: The Secret Service is an early oddball of the year that does to James Bond what Kickass did to superheroes. Its unexpected shift in tones, crazy action sequences & eccentric use of humour may not go well with everyone but even its detractors can't deny the awesomeness of the church scene. While certainly a no match to Vaughn's previous effort, this British spy action comedy is nevertheless an enjoyable, entertaining & amusing ride that comes gleefully recommended.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Don't watch it with your nan,"Manners. Maketh. Man. So says the dapperly-dressed secret agent Harry Hart (Colin Firth), right before he bars all exits and proceeds to glass, stab and maim an assortment of goons in that most British of locales, the pub. Kingsman, the latest film from Layer Cake (2004) and X-Men: First Class (2011) director Matthew Vaughn, and his second collaboration with comic-book writer Mark Millar (after 2010's Kick-Ass), is both completely preposterous and ridiculously entertaining, simultaneously mocking and paying homage to the traditional idea of Britishness in an ever-changing society, and no doubt infuriating many a Daily Mail reader in the process.Harry Hart, a Harry Palmer-like gent, is a Kingsman; a highly secretive and unaligned ring of spies and agents who dress sharply and certainly know their manners. After an operation to rescue Professor Arnold (Mark Hamill) from a possible kidnapping plot sees one Kingsman agent disposed of in a particularly gruesome fashion, Harry is tasked with finding a replacement to fill the spot. The son of a former agent who saved Harry's life years previously, Eggsy (Taron Egerton), is now growing up in a council flat with his layabout mother and abusive stepfather. After a joyride lands him in the police station, Eggsy calls the number on the back of a Kingsman medal given to him by Harry when he was a child, and he is bailed.Harry enters Eggsy into the trials to become a Kingsman agent along with a bunch of upper-class toffs who refer to Eggsy as a 'pleb'. The group of youngsters must perform a series of tasks under the watchful eye of Merlin (Mark Strong), involving escaping from a flooded room and shooting a dog in the head. Meanwhile, Harry investigates links from recent strange events to internet billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a flamboyant man with a lisp and a fondness for wearing caps indoors. whose upcoming deal to offer SIM cards with free calls and internet to everybody for free reeks of conspiracy and may be related to an incident involving an exploding head.When Harry and Valentine have their inevitable face-to-face sit-down moment, the two munch on Big Macs at Valentine's hideously decorated mansion while discussing the joys of the ludicrous Bond movies of old, when things weren't taken so seriously. Kingsman is an obvious Bond pastiche, with deadly gadgets, a henchman wielding an unconventional weapon (in this case - knives for feet), and an outrageous villain. It even comes as a surprise when Firth fails to raise an eyebrow while delivering a double entendre. It shows that these kinds of movies can still be fun without the shadow of uber- seriousness seen in the Daniel Craig Bond's and the recent Bourne movies lurking overhead, while telling the people who will be inevitably offended by the spurts of shocking violence to get a grip and remember that it's only a movie.However, it did little to prepare me for the movie's key set-piece, which involves a church in Kentucky inhabited by a group of bigoted, right-wing religious types - and Harry - indulge in what can only be described as a pub-brawl massacre. I have never witnessed a scene that would usually be portrayed as a tragedy executed with such glee, with Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird blaring out while men and women are stabbed, shot, bludgeoned, set on fire and, in one particularly grisly moment, get slammed into a wall so hard it snaps their spine in two. It seems to go on and on, but it's an absolutely thrilling moment stocked full of cartoon violence, and will no doubt making some viewers expecting a light and funny experience wholly uncomfortable in the process.It's sadly not all great. Eggsy's recruitment and training is formulaic and none of the tasks are particularly original or clever. This period of the film also keeps Eggsy and Harry apart for most of it, when their few scenes crackle with chemistry. But ultimately, Kingsman is an intriguing experience. bending to generic tropes while seemingly playing by its own rules. Firth displays a comedic willingness rarely seen and Egerton, who has popped up from nowhere, is a real find as the swaggering Eggsy, a baseball-cap wearing yoof who calls people 'bruv', who in most actors hands would have come across as extremely annoying. Kingsman dabbles in enough extreme violence to cause most viewers to question what they really enjoy seeing on screen, and it's a throwback with a modern twist, celebrating the days when movies could be fun, inexplicable and inconsequential, Just don't watch it with your nan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Worth a watch!,"Went into the cinema with sort of high hopes after watching trailer after trailer on television. I really hoped it would live up to the hype surrounding it. I really like the direct who also directed Kickass in Matthew Vaughn. I did come out of the theatre entertained so in some capacity the film achieved its goal but however there was unnecessary humour through the exploitation of teenage stereotypes which I did not find funny at all. This humour was just not for me, there was other people in the cinema which found stealing cars, saying ""Bruv"" hilarious so it did hit some level of the audience. The humour did take a good turn towards the end of the film which had good moments. The plot line and twists where actually really good some that audience would next expect. I really enjoyed the plot as It had a good story. The characters were semi-likable but not always that great in my opinion. Colin Furth was very good in the movie and so was the lead Taron Egerton but the Villain in Samuel Jackson just became really annoying by the end. But overall it was good cast and solid performances.I would really recommend this film to friends or family as it was entertaining, okay humour, good actions scenes, and good performances. However some of the humour may only be targeting certain people which could be a issue when the film releases to wider countries very soon. It was also one of the very few times that I have been to the cinema recently that it was near full so Kingsman is obviously doing something right.I would give the film a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Brilliant, twisted, thrilling, funny, pleasantly enjoyable and agreeably entertaining.  Matthew Vaughn strikes gold (again).  He has a licence to thrill this time.  A winner.","We have got eight more months until we see Spectre, which we be Bond's next outing on the silver screen. If there in anything in these eight months that would entertain us while waiting, Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Secret Service is one of the closest to your calling.Five years ago, we got Kick-Ass, a spoof superhero movie that unleashed a new cinematic language. It was rather one of the most irresistibly entertaining films of the past few years. It's ultra-violent structure and bar-over-topping scale of profanity and humour proved that director Vaughn could be a genius at this stuff. The plot focuses on a teenager who decides to become a superhero. Basically for me, even though it isn't one of my favourite films of all time, the film feels like an instant classic.Newcomer Taron Egerton plays Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin, a cockney teen from London. Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is a secret agent who works for Kingsman (a secret spy service similar to MI6) on a ""Diagon Alley"", like London street. He finds 'Eggsy' and recruits him to stop an evil mastermind, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). He wants to take over the world with an evil plan (the typical baddie plot, hey?). But before doing so, he needs to complete in a few life-risking tasks with other opponents (sounds familiar to you? Hunger Games? Divergent? Yes, most of the young adult books seem the same these days. Don't you agree?).Mark Strong and Michael Caine play supporting roles alongside Firth in the service. Even Star Wars' Mark Hamill pops up (as a professor, not a Jedi in case you were wondering...) and clearly and obviously, at 63, looks different to how he looked four decades ago. Let's see how he revisits as Luke again in ""The Force Awakens"" this December.The jokes arrive agreeably but not as quickly as I was expecting. The film deals with themes such as dysfunction families and bullying. These are serious issues so some ways it has a more mature nature than Vaughn's previous film (Kick-Ass). Vaughn's tone hasn't changed which is a relief. Even if it takes time to register, it's pretty funny stuff. Vaughn and his co-writer Jane Goldman also throw in Bond references as well which add to the fun.The lacking of ultra-violence is really the only disappointment. There's an overlong entertaining church fight sequence, and the climax at the finale is overblown (probably one of the biggest key references to Bond throughout the whole film). There's also a noticeably clichéd but really fun pub battle. Other than these, there's not a huge amount of action.You can't help thinking that it might be a mirror image of Vaughn's previous film as it's done by the same director and writers. But after a while, you get used to the different structure of the film itself.Could Vaughn be an expert at spy movies? I can't answer this. It's a question only for you to answer. Myself, I consider it to be perhaps the best and most clever spy spoof since the Johnny English films. So my answer would be that he would not entirely be an expert at spy movies but one at these style of spoofs. Having done a superhero spoof in 2010 and a spy spoof in 2015, we'll have to see what handle he'll give us in another five years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I don't know if I watched two movies in one or what ? There first half was good and everything was leading up for this to be a good movie. The second half turned into a complete different movie.This movie is to the point it shouldn't have been released if what you call action is senseless shootings and exploding body parts are all over the screen. I totally forgot what was the point of this movie after the anal sex reference. Where is good writing and screen play for movies ??

No middle way - you will love or hate this film,"And I absolutely loved it.It is VERY violent. A scene in which dozens of people's heads explode to Land of Hope and Glory, with fireworks thrown in was both a high point and pretty typical of the humour involved. If you would find that distasteful then watch something else. Otherwise... its great.And actually its really not that gory. Yes, people explode, are shot, sliced in half etc. but there is actually very, very little blood - so it is actually fantasy. The violence is cartoon violence. Think Tom & Jerry.But leave that aside - the story is brilliant. As others have said, this is how James Bond SHOULD be. Gadgets and gizmos, jokes and one- liners, twinkles in the eye, good guys and bad. But it also undermines the type in so many fun ways.All action, the near two hours flew by.I was left wanting more - but PLEASE let there be no sequel. No way a second film could be as good as this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Agent Cody Banks for adults: a modern James Bond film,"Kingsman: The secret Service is a wonderful new film in the spy- action genre. The film is directed by Matthew Vaughn, who has directed some interesting stuff in the past, including X-men: First Class, Stardust and Kick-Ass. The film stars Taron Egerton as Eggsy, and Colin Firth as Harry Hart.This film feels like an early James Bond flick, with all the wacky villains and plots one would expect from such a film. However, it really has modernized the message and approach, with extreme, if goofy, violence and lots of modern gadgets and goodies. There is a lot of charm in this film, and it makes me feel like a young boy again, watching flicks like Thunderbirds or Agent Cody Banks or Spy Kids.Even so, this is not a film for children. It just has that slight fantastical feel that many children's spy films are graced with.There is a ton to enjoy in this film. The spy genre is done well, with intrigue, gadgetry, and Bond-esque suave/cool. The actors are superb, with Samuel L. Jackson making an appearance as a particularity interesting character. There was also good, taught emotional drive throughout the film. I was superbly impressed with this film.On a minor note, the film did have some corny/kitschy elements which did not always work. There was one scene in particular near the beginning, in a log cabin, which I thought was a bit much. These scenes were relatively small in number, however, and did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the film.This movie was great, and deserves to be cherished as an excellent new addition to the spy genre. I look forward to more from all the actors involved, and especially Mr. Vaughn. I would love to see this become a James Bond style series of films as well.This film is highly recommended. Just don't show it to your kids please. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Jonno Davies plays Lee, the unlikely hero and holds his own along the strong cast. But it is Samuel L. Jackson's nerdy villain with a lisp, Valentine, that makes me chuckle every single time.The action scenes are fun and easy to follow, although at times a bit to graphic for the lighthearted.

A very good film....but...,"""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a very good film....exciting and heart-pounding throughout. However, it has a couple problems and you might want to think twice before watching it or letting your kids watch it.The story is very much a reworking of the Jame Bond films...with a few major differences. Instead of one incredibly super agent working for the British secret service, this film is about an organization of men working for the British government as super spies. So, if they want to concentrate on different agents in upcoming films (such as in the third film), they can since it's not just about one guy. Also, while the agents are very sophisticated like Bond, they are more killing machines....with MASSIVE amounts of blood and gore. Oddly, Bond killed folks, mostly as a group in some exploding lair, but there was no blood and not nearly as much violence as you'd assume you'd see.There are two main plots for this secret organization. The first one involves the recruitment of a new agent, Eggsy (Taron Egerton). Much of the movie concentrates on his training and, ultimately, his first mission. To me, this was the most interesting part of the movie. This leads to the mission...the second plot. A billionaire maniac, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) is planning something bloody and evil....and very genocidal. And, naturally, it's up to the two new recruits to go into action.For the most part, I really liked the film aside from the incredible violence. It was smart, well written and well acted. But one scene really left me a bit turned off. Eggy's protégé (Colin Firth) is in a church in Kentucky when suddenly it turns into a giant bloodbath and everyone is killed but this agent. What bothered me is that I think this scene was meant to celebrate this mass killing, as the church members were all extremists....ultra-right wingers who were filled with hate and prejudices. It made me uncomfortable that the film seemed to minimize the deaths of these idiots...idiots but human beings. Don't get me wrong, the deaths of many people wasn't necessarily the problem...as in the end something similar happens. Why is the later kill-fest not the same? Well those later killed were all involved in committing mass genocide. Is being politically incorrect (and a bunch of jerks) as bad as those who commit genocide? And, should we enjoy seeing people we dislike killed like this?Overall, a film I generally liked but one that you never should let kids watch or anyone who cannot handle the gore. Also, you may find yourself uncomfortable with that church murder scene. If it had been in an abortion clinic or meeting of any left-wing group, it would have been equally repellent to me...though from what I noticed in other reviews, it didn't bother a lot of the viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of the Most Enthrawling Action Movies of Recent Years,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is directed by Matthew Vaughn and stars Taron Egerton as young Eggsy, a teenage street kid that is recruited by a spy organization, and must compete with other recruits in his class in order to become the next Kingsman, a gentleman like spy. Upon being recruited, he befriends an older Kingsman named Galahad, played by Colin Firth, that teaches him the ways of being a Kingsman, and, more importantly, being a gentleman.I actually didn't want to see this movie. I've never been too hot on espionage films, and wasn't looking forward to Kingsman. However, this movie proved me wrong in so many ways. I had an absolute blast watching Kingsman, and so regret not seeing it the theaters. Near everything about this film entertained me, and I was on the edge of my seat through every single action sequence. Kingsman was one of the few movies of recent years in which I had white knuckles through every single action scene, and even most of the talking scenes. Kingsman was an amazing movie, and had great aspects about it.The best thing about Kingsman is the actors' portrayals of the characters. Prior to watching this movie, I doubted Colin Firth as an action hero, but he was fantastic as this gentleman spy. I read that he did 80% of his own stunts, and it really paid off. Taron Egerton was the highlight of this film. He displayed Eggsy's large character arc near perfectly, and delivered every single one of his lines believably. Samuel L. Jackson played a great villain, and was another great attribute that Kingsman had going for it. He pulled off the ""evil plan"" cliché, while also acknowledging that it was a cliché.The direction by Matthew Vaughn was amazing as well. The way he manipulated the camera to film at varying speeds while weaving in between characters, mid fight, during the action sequences was excellent. He brought every scene to life so vibrantly that Kingsman sucks the audience in after watching it for only 5 minutes. All of the direction was great, and brought the film to new levels of expertise very quickly.The score was the third thing that really pulled me into the scenes, particularly the suspenseful ones. Without going into too much detail, the parachute scene was one of the most suspenseful scenes I've seen in recent years, and the music had a great part in it. All of the music throughout the entirety of Kingsman was astounding, and sucked me into the film so easily that I felt like I was there, in the film, rather than watching it.The only problem I had with Kingsman was the ending. Not particularly how the film ended, but some subplots that weren't wrapped up like I had hoped they would've been. This is most likely due to the presence of a looming sequel (Kingsman: The Golden Circle coming in 2017), but I still would've preferred some closure with certain characters and stories that the film presented. Besides that, however, I loved Kingsman.Overall, Kingsman: The Secret Service was a great movie, and I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys action, espionage, or just good movies all around.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Saving the World by Killing All of Its Inhabitants,"After his father is killed in the service of his country, ""Eggsy"" (Taron Egerton) lives with his mother and her low-class boyfriend with little opportunity for upward mobility. However, he still holds onto a locket given to him as a young boy with an advisement to call an inscribed number if he ever needs serious help. So, one day after fighting off some local bullies and being subsequently arrested for stealing the gang member's car, he makes the call. To his surprise, he is immediately released, and the charges are all dropped. It's then that he learns that his father was a member of a clandestine organization in the British government known as the ""Kingsman"" and he is encouraged to join. However, it isn't nearly as easy to graduate from the program as he would like, and he watches as the other people selected begin to drop out one by one. Meanwhile, a crazed billionaire by the name of ""Richmond Valentine"" (Samuel L. Jackson) who has come up with a plan to save the world from greenhouse gasses by killing almost all of the people who inhabit it. And with very few agents available to investigate, Eggsy is called upon to help out before everything and everyone is killed. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was an interesting movie which raced from one exciting scene to the next in a very smooth manner. Unfortunately, the director (Matthew Vaughn) chose to take the low-road and utilized an over-abundance of vulgarity for the sake of some cheap laughs much too often. And most of it was simply unnecessary. In any event, this grew rather tiring after a while and seriously limited the movie's overall appeal. But even so, it was still entertaining to a certain degree, and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thank you for Kingsman!,"This is one of those movies where after the it ends you will say, that was 2 hours well spent. Action begins from the go, and it is very realistic or at least they have made it look realistic on the screen, unlike some other similar movies, there is no flying or gravity defying moves here, its more of a close combat and that really intrigued me. Precision perfect stunts and amazing cinematography with a touch of humor will definitely make you come alive. The characters in the movie are really appealing, A notable candidate would be the super villain, calm,humorous and villainous all at the same time, loved his character. Even though the movie is action packed, it comes with a good story, a very good one in fact, so the bottom line is, this is a Great Movie and worth your time !",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

'The suit is the modern gentleman's armour. The Kingsmen are the new knights.',"Full court press with a British action thriller served up with a generous dollop of humor, this very successful film is based on the comic book 'The Secret Service' (writers Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons) and transformed into a screenplay by Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughan – that guy responsible for 'Kick-Ass', X-Men: First Class', 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' 'Layer Cake', 'Stardust'.For those of us who are not comic book fans or have not heard of the comic book on which this fantastic movie is based, the following is an explanation by Colin Firth's character in the script:' 'Since 1849, Kingsman Tailors have clothed the world's most powerful individuals. In 1919, a great number of them had lost their heirs to World War I. That meant a lot of money going uninherited. And a lot of powerful men with the desire to preserve peace and protect life. Our founders realized that they could channel that wealth and influence for the greater good. And so began our adventure. An independent international intelligence agency operating at the highest level of discretion. Without the politics and bureaucracy that undermine the intelligence of government-run spy organisations. A suit is the modern gentleman's armour. And the Kingsman agents are the new knights.'And that is only the explanation of the Kingsmen title. The film is blessed with a superb cast. The plot is all over the place and the action speaks louder than ideas of words. It tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. Among the featured actors are Colin Firth as Galahad/Harry Hart, Michael Caine as Arthur, Mark Strong as Merlin, Jack Davenport as Lancelot, unrecognizable Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold, Sofia Boutella as the lower extremity enhance weapon Gazele who assists Samuel L. Jackson as super bad guy Valentine, Jonno Davies as Lee, and the very impressive new face hunk Taron Egerton as Eggsy. Cinematography is by George Richmond, and the musical score is by Henry Jackman, Matthew Margeson with a bow to Sir Edward Elgar. Great special effects and an ending to end all endings make this a full evening of pleasure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
As good or as silly as any Bond movie.,"Didn't watch this to analyze the plot, sub-plots or characters. Just had a couple of hours to spare to hopefully be entertained and have a giggle now and then, it did it. It's a silly spy movie with ridiculous heroes and villains, with a lot of deference paid to the Bond genre.

"Well-executed, over-the-top action film","This easily blends the fast-paced and unbelievable action of a comic book film with the absurd, dry British wit of excellent veteran actor Colin Firth. He is Harry Hart code named Galahad, a member of a secret international espionage and intelligence organization called The Kingsman. He recruits Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), a young 20 something petty criminal who's the son of a friend that died saving Galahad years before.Eggsy is competing with other young recruits, most of them young people from British aristocratic families, for the spot to become the new Lancelot. At the same time, tech billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a strange lisp and Yankees hat) is plotting a dastardly world takeover with comic villain aplomb by kidnapping or recruiting wealthy aristocrats, politicians, and other people with spreading around money and influence to further his plot. A large part of that plot is the global distribution of free WiFi-enabled sim cards.The Kingsman have the unique guise of posing as tailors to Britain and the world's wealthiest and influential people. They operate out of an enormous underground complex based out of an above ground tailor shop. They're independent of normal government oversight and restriction, having operated since the early 20th century shortly after WWI ended. ""We are the new knights,"" is how Galahad explains their mission to Eggsy shortly after his recruitment.Matthew Vaughan and comic book Mark Millar who previously worked together to bring Kick-Ass and Wanted to the big screen, once again collaborate with even better results than these previous films. This is easily Matthew Vaughan's best film since his British gangster film days. What really makes this film work so seamlessly though is the performance of Colin Firth, he's the perfect gentleman spy and he gives a perfect credibility to the all the gadgets, martial arts and intense action scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Much potential, much crap","I realize this is a spy spoof, but this is just another modern film that proves conclusively that just because you can do something, doesn't necessarily mean that you should. The movie shows signs of having class, style, and some really good effects, but erupts with classless senseless violence before the end of the movie. The only thing that saved the rating above a 5 was it had a good ending with good closure. This movie could have been sensational, but unfortunately turned into nothing more than one of those chain saw horror films on steroids. If you like that sort of film, this movie is for you. Not my 'cup of tea'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A fun movie, but a bit over the top","Kingsman is the first of many spy movies coming out this year (Mission Impossible, James Bond etc.) and it is pretty awesome. We have Colin Firth playing a smooth gentleman spy/killer and we've got Samuel L. Jackson playing a hilarious, weird villain. I mean, this is enough reason to go see this right?The story is loosely based on a graphic novel so it's not entirely original, but it is definitely not any Marvel superhero movie. The story and plot are a little different than most movies, but it is still straightforward and fairly easy to understand. It is a really cool concept to; extremely proper, dressed up gentlemen spies/killers going out to stop this maniac of a villain from destroying the world. Speaking of the villain, this guy doesn't always seem like an obvious villain because sometimes you see his point. And he's very funny too; for example how he can't stand the sight of any violence. Kingsman is not only a gory action movie though, it also has plenty of good humor. So basically, the story is very humorous, genius and well paced, while the plot is different but still easy to understand.In the acting category, this movie strives. Colin Firth is awesome and fits his role perfectly. Samuel L. Jackson is also perfect for his role as the villain; he really brings his character across as a hilarious dude, but also an evil maniac. And the main character is played by newcomer, Taron Egerton. Man is he great. He was funny, but also did some great action stunts. Literally, the casting guys on this movie nailed it.I loved the music on this movie as well. It had this really great theme, but in between, it also had some great pop music that really fit well with the action scenes. Now this isn't you're usual pop music that comes on the radio 1,000 times per day. No this is just fun lyric-less pop jams that help give the movie a humorous tone.CGI is another category that was present in this movie. Though a lot was done practically there were some visual effects in here as well. And most of it wasn't bad. But some of it was quite bad. A few of the shots were just so apparent that they were CGI, that it was almost cringe worthy. Other than that, the CGI wasn't bad, but it was far from perfect.Action was a big part of this movie so I will touch on that a little bit. First of all, it was very fun to watch. It was very stylized, with shaky camera movement and slow-mo. There were also a few shots that vaguely resembled some Matrix camera moves, which I loved. I was very pleased with the action and the way it was shot. That being said, this movie was extremely over the top especially the action. Some of it was unrealistically unrealistic. If that makes sense. But I love over the top action so it was great.In the end, Kingsman was a fun spy action/comedy with great acting and a cool story. While some of it was not so great, it still delivered what it was supposed to.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Just an amazing, fun ride","I only recently saw this gem. Yes, the violence is over the top, ridiculous, and possibly even satirical at some points. I'm not personally a huge fan of violence, but it was all cartoon-like enough that it never felt ""traumatizing"" at any point. A lot of other people complain that the movie couldn't decide whether to be serious or comical, but I truly don't see why this is an issue. I think it's that mix that actually made the movie so fun.So if you're offended by a little ridiculous violence or strongly believe that movies strictly need to fall into binary of serious or comical, then perhaps it's not for you. If you're anyone else, however, please see this movie as soon as possible.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
4 Me a waste of time,"Only taped it on my TV 'cause of the string of actors I enjoyed in the past. After yawning a few times through it and pretending I was not hearing the inappropriate language, (Yes it was there just like people will put ketchup on any kind of food). The end came with some kind of relief. I did not entirely dislike it though and realised we don't have all the same taste. I have never seen Kick Ass which was mentioned by many reviewers and since I've almost stop drinking probably will never see any of them. Like someone mentioned there is black humour, violence, bad language (oh hardly any sex, beside oral sex yes f---k as if it came out of a drum kit to mark the tempo) But as already hinted ...it's not for me, again to each its own!

Fast-paced and fun...,"This movie was actually a lot more entertaining and fun than I had expected or dared to hope for.The story was well-written. fast paced and had all the right elements which included action, romance, humor, spies, gadgets and so forth.The acting in ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" was good, and they had a very unique and talented ensemble of actors and actresses on the cast list. However, I did find the villain in the movie was a bit too eccentric to really be taken all that serious, which was a shame because it gave the movie sort of a cheesy comic book quality to it.The special effects in the movie were great and very convincing. The action sequences were great to look at and nicely choreographed. The gadgets and gizmos were great and very much in tune with movies such as ""James Bond"".All in all, then ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is definitely a movie well worth spending your time money and effort, on especially if you like action spy movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"I went in expecting a James Bond ripoff, I left wanting a sequel.","It's easy to create an action movie based on big guns, big men screaming, and big name actors. Not this movie. This movie had a style all of its own. It was fresh, fun, and exhilarating. Something that this movie does differently than other action films is actually use the camera in its advantage. Instead of having the camera be something to put on a tripod while waiting for the special effects to happen, the camera is used to portray fluid motion. You can see every punch, gunshot, and stab easily; and the camera compliments them perfectly. If I were to complain about something, it would be the characters. I feel that the characters weren't anything special, and they all seemed to be the same person played by a different actor. However, that doesn't necessarily matter, for what they lack in characters, they succeed in a surprisingly interesting story. The antagonist wasn't the run-of-the-mill mad man who wants to take over the world: the antagonist had solid reasons for what he's doing, and the film explains it fairly well.Essentially, this was a very fun movie, and I highly suggest it if you're in the mood for a brand new type of action movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Stylish Indeed.....,"There is nothing like the meeting of style and substance, on style it certainly scores, on substance it falls a tad short. Colin Firth was exceptional as Gallahad. 
 Could have Eggsy's part been better played by anyone else, may well have... Samuel L Jackson as a comic villain just about does an okay job. Initial fight scenes were classy, a touch of Tarantino I find there, the church scene was great, but the action sequences towards the end by Eggsy were more video-gamish, the CGI was pretty bad there. Overall still a treat to the eyes, I go with a 7/10, thoroughly entertained...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Action packed and surprisingly good!,"We highly recommend watching Kingsman. The action is amazing. It's non-stop, appropriately paced, and quite violent. Sam L. Jackson is the opposition who has a half- baked plan to end global warming. He is protected by a prosthetic wearing hench-woman who is a stand out in the film. You will find yourself thinking, ""I didn't expect her to do that!""Eggsy is instantly likable protagonist. At first glance he is a misguided teen; but extremely loyal to his friends, little sibling, and mum. It is the loyalty quality and another underdeveloped talent (gymnastics) that make Eggsy an excellent candidate for the Kingsmen. Thanks to the same Kingsmen (Colin Firth) who gave Eggsy's father a chance years earlier, Eggsy jumps at the opportunity to try to become one. The transformation from thug being raised by his 'emotionally lost' mum and her nasty boyfriend to a debonair secret agent is completed through humor, teamwork, trust building, high tech gadgets, and loads of violent choreographed action.

Bloody fun,"I've been waiting for this film for a long time and I have to say that I was surprised as to how good this movie is. The trailer seemed boring, so I was not expecting much, but the first ten minutes was great and it set the tone for the rest of the film. What I truly loved about this is even though its a spy movie, it still had fresh, original characters with great personalities, mainly Valentine. The plot is great and the events are played out so well, even though anybody could think of this plot. But it is the action sequence and dialog that makes this film a memorable one. Its truly British so it was great to finally see a culture other than American, especially one as charming as the Brits. Kudos to the director for this amazing work. I am not sure why it got an R rating though, the blood and gore seemed okay to me, not over the top but still so very good. I was pleased to see fresh faces and Samuel L. Jackson playing a chill role. The biggest surprise was Colin Firth, I never knew he could kick so much ass ! I am never going to forget his role. Finally, the best thing about the movie is the absence of over the top explosions. The 'big' scenes are all hand on hand combat (with appropriate gear) and it was fantastic ! I have never felt more alive or joyous to see people get brutally killed and have their limbs hacked off or their brains splattered out as I did in this film. Maybe its how the Brits do it, but for the first time, I didn't see the badass girl wearing skintight clothes that barely cover anything or having a supermodel pose throughout the film... the girl with the legs was a complete badass and I am in love. Its a great film that you will enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Very Entertaining.,"I've never read the comics and I was never a fan of Colin Firth, but Kingsman isn't bad at all. An awful lot of people in the reviews that I've read are comparing this to Bond. In my opinion you can't compare them, they're to different . The film has plenty of action, great fight scenes,Firth is excellent. The story does start to fall apart a bit around the last half hour of the movie , it was like the script writers tried to inject a lot of humour and they ended up overdoing it. The main villain I thought was weak,and the movie does suffer to an extent for these reasons. Still, kingsman is enjoyable if you don't mind over the top action, and if you just take it for what it is, you'll like it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Watch it and have very good time, trust me.We all know the spectacular actor Colin Firth is, and watching playing this ""different"" role suited him perfectly.

Class Apart Spy Film,"I'm a fan of spy films and an addict of Bond films. Must have watched each Bond film multiple times. However, I also like the good old spy films like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.Basically, spy films according to me are of two types - the Bond type and the non Bond type. Bond type is where the plot is thin as a wafer and there are fast cars, gadgets, comic book villains, big action set pieces and sexy women.The non Bond type is exactly opposite of the above. Solid story minus the glamour.Matthew Vaughn just turns the tables. He and his writers create an excellent and delicious cocktail of the above types that left me high for a long while.So like Bond films there is a comic book villain (played deliciously by Samuel L Jackson), a bit ridiculous plot, some cool gadgets, good action sequences and a couple of hot women which includes a villain's henchwoman who has blade feet and cuts people apart literally.It also has the story of who are Kingsman, an independent spy agency and how time on time have saved the world from crisis. Kingsman can be looked as a coming age of film of a young man who is wasting his life who turns into a spy and gets meaning and purpose.So you have the writers who spoof Bond, Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer and all the major spy movies we have seen till date. However, its not like Austin Powers and Johnny English which were out and out spoofs. Here Vaughan ensures that things are in control.It also helps that he gets in a good bunch of actors to play key roles. What attracted me to this film was Colin Firth playing the role of a spy and doing action sequences. Frankly, Firth is a marvelous actor but never seem his doing an action film. After watching Kingsman, I say man please do some more action films because Firth is a pretty decent action hero. Check out the pub and church scene.Egerton is also a star to watch out for in the future. He is talented and nicely plays the part of young drifter who turns into a good spy. Jackson is brilliant as usual and Strong does a commendable job.However, the only thing I didn't like abt the film is the blood shed. Well, killing people with guns and bombs in fine. But here Vaughan is very inspired from Tarantino's work. So there is lot of blood spilled and the church scene is a classic case.If you are someone who doesn't like blood and gore stay away. However, if you love spy films and don't mind the blood spill...you'll enjoy Kingsman. I hope there is a sequel for it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Disappointed I can't give minus stars,"The lamest, most overdone movie since Clive Owens ""Shoot em Up""

"I'm not convinced this is as good as it THINKS it is, but there is enough to admire to give it a go.","You come away from ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" a little breathless, but more-so down to its bounding energy and sheer brashness than because you feel you have just seen a great film. For sure, the film is a colourful, kinetic experience; a series of brutal body blows which pulls you left; right and centre - across genres and through homages, but that did not stop me from feeling pleased that it was all over when it was.In spite of whatever ""Kingsman"" does well - the good choreography; the want to see the characters make it through their odds; the amusing villain - there is an annoying feeling of puerility to the film, or of immaturity. When Matthew Vaughn released ""Kick-Ass"" in 2010, the cover of a popular British film magazine depicted one of the characters in full superhero garb and the headline 'Say Hello to Your New Favourite Film', and there is that same aggravating, even adolescent, sense with ""Kingsman"". It is difficult to put into words, but I am sure you know what I mean - the film is far from being your typical brain-dead blockbuster, and one cannot fault its ambition, but it lacks a certain nuance or sense of subtlety.The film tells the double-stranded tale of a young London lad getting out of one world and into another alongside a suave veteran of espionage who senses his time is coming to an end as comrades die around him and world threats seem to intensify. Colin Firth plays said veteran: a secret agent by the name of Harry Hart, who operates as Galahad in an all-action British governmental group running in covert operations - try to imagine James Bond's 'Double O' section on steroids.Parallel to him is the story of Taron Egerton's character Gary, colloquially referred to as 'Eggsy', whose father was part of the same eponymous secret service group Galahad is in until he was killed in action some twenty years ago. Raised fatherless, both he and his mother have since fallen on harder times and Gary, now in his early twenties, finds himself occupying a flat in a seedy part of London whilst periodically falling out with his mother's sociopathic new boyfriend and dodging potentially fatal gang warfare.Gary and Galahad's worlds collide when the latter loses yet another agent during a mission in snowy Argentina, wherein a scientist specialising in global warming has been kidnapped and a rescue attempt is botched. Galahad's boss, played by Michael Caine, is losing patience: this particular agent, discovered and groomed by Galahad himself, did not live up to expectations. Gary, meanwhile, is living on even less borrowed time and comes into contact with Firth's character through some relatively convoluted means in order to begin, in true ""Men in Black"" style, his inception into the universe of this elite secret agency.Providing energy to the piece is Samuel L. Jackson's wonderful villain Richmond Valentine; a politician hating eco-terrorist with a speech impediment who has made his name operating in the technology industry and flinches at the sight of blood. He has his henchwoman, Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), take care of the more murderous side of being a super villain - think a more nubile version of Richard Kiel's Jaws character, but with legs and feet replacing teeth...We have seen films like ""Kingsman"" before, and we have previously enjoyed narratives similar to what is depicted therein, but Vaughn is canny enough to construct the experience in such a way that has us feel like this is our first time. The film is not manipulative in this respect, but it is brash. As was the case with ""Kick-Ass"", it takes absolutely no interest in whether or not it is offending you or even wearing you down - like it or not, this is the route it's taking. Through whatever means, the film manages to balance both revisionism and convention into a congealed, post-modernist package.The way the film eventually comes to fuse the execution of a dastardly plan Valentine is hatching; Gary undergoing his training and the Kingsman agency uncovering a series of strange occurrences around the world of army militias conspicuously turning on themselves is satisfying. Midway through, Vaughn plummets us headfirst into a steadycam sequence of one of these militias fighting one another in what is a quite striking scene outlining in equal measure both precisely what is at stake should our heroes fail and that the makers of the film have an eye for raw flair and constructive carnage.Despite being an incredibly striking film, this sequence to one side, I am unsure as to whether ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" amounts to much more than a well-made actioner with a familiar tale of a farmhand leaving behind his domestic set-up for world-saving greatness. It deals, mostly, in stereotypes: the fascist American southerners; the suave Westminster Londoner; the Scandinavian blonde and the Millwall Football Club yobs. Meanwhile, you get the feeling there was meant to be a message embedded in the film somewhere to do with the danger of phone/tablet technology, and what it is turning people into, but it gets a little lost.Irrespective, there is enough in ""Kingsman"" to recommend it - it executes what it wants to do with a certain unbridled brazenness and does what it wants with a level of enthusiasm where many other action films too often feel like they are going through the motions. This is not the case here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This is how movies should be,"Before i have seen the full movie i felt a slight childish motive behind it. You know kid spy movie and all. Then i looked at the cast and thought what can go wrong. Nothing went wrong. First of all this movie kinda proves you can do action scenes/movies without exploding everything and anything. Second of all plot of the movie is extremely tasty. It is not like your original bad guy is trying to do evil with evil means. Samuel Jackson's bad guy gives you mixed feelings. It is like you love to hate him or hate to love him kinda situation. Movie shows extremely diplomatic action on hand like dinner table conversations and convincing people are worth more than removing them from the game. My other compliment is for Mark Strong fans. We all seen him as convincing voiced bad guy but Mark Strong keeps rising from that streotype to charming mentor/voice of guiandince all the time. As for action scenes, man i haven't had fun since my early childhood Jackie Chan movie this much. Well coordinated little absurd also you gotta love the songs running on the background.

Bond. Chav Bond.,"Kingsman is an entertaining and fun movie. The pace of the film is upbeat and exciting, while the action scenes are an extravaganza of over-the-top, but very enjoyable, choreography.Kingsman: The Secret Service follows a young man, nicknamed Eggsy, who begins the story as a delinquent. Invited into a society of spies, Eggsy undergoes intense training and begins to develop discipline and confidence. Under the tutelage of Hart, his spy mentor, Eggsy becomes a formidable agent and is eventually faced with a Bond-style supervillain.The Eggsy character undergoes a transformative journey that most movie-goers have seen in endless iterations in many different stories. The story begins with a less-than-ideal hero and this hero eventually undergoes a journey that addresses inner turmoil and emerges as a better person. How the film tells this story, however, is what makes the film enjoyable.While the action scenes are the best part of the movie, they can also be downright goofy at times, with people getting cut clean in half or flipping through the air like a rag doll after getting hit. There are also far too many McDonald product placements in the film. The movie also suffers from somewhat generic features, such as; generic premise, plot, and character motivations.Despite these flaws, Kingsman is still an entertaining film. The casting and acting are great, the writing is good, and the pacing is fine. This movie is worth watching based on the spectacular action scenes alone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
So self aware it might hurt,"At least some of the viewers. Comedy is always something that will divide people. Because what's funny to someone, others find boring or annoying. I'll just say colorful sprinkle, you'll know what I mean, when you see it towards the end of the movie. I thought it was awesome, but I heard people complain about this ""getting out of hand"", being unrealistic/over the top.But that's it, because while it seems to have both feet firmly on the ground, it's always on some other level ""flying"" around and giving kudos to old spy movies by acknowledging their existence and tweaking, sometimes twisting our expectations. Something that is done very nicely. But the movie is not meant for those easily offended. It has some crude humor and one of the last scenes, will have a couple of people (especially in America) cringe .. more so, than if some violence was involved.If you can deal with that and don't mind this being ""British"" to a point, but very on the point when it comes to jokes, while not forgetting that there are consequences, you'll enjoy this.

Why are people calling this VIOLENT ?,"The ""violence"" is only the same type of sterilised faux violence that you find in Bond movies but just more of it. It,s very well done and I, personally find gratuitous violence in films so unnecessary, there are so many ways that film-makers can portray violence without actually showing it in graphic detail. A great film, it out bonded Bond by a long way. I don't want to go into the usual over the top orgasmic reviews, some of you should certainly get out more. I cant find much to criticise, the plot of course, is as usual for the genre, totally implausible with more holes than a colander full of colanders, but ..............that is par for the course. Plausible plots in spy films haven't risen their heads since Harry Palmer and too much reality in films is hardly ever good for the box office.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Entertaining,"A seasoned British spy (Colin Firth) mentors a younger spy (Taron Egerton) as they join a broader effort to save the world from an evil plan of an eccentric billionaire (Samuel L. Jackson).""Kingsman"" is occasionally too busy in its story but is still above average compared to other modern suspense-thrillers. It also has more than its fair share of violence (the odd use of the upbeat song ""Pomp and Circumstance"" in a particular scene is bizarrely unforgettable). Yet it still comes off as entertaining and enjoyable.Like the James Bond films (likely an influence), the gadgets and special effects add much to the entertainment value. Firth also brings along his dependable amount of class and talent especially in a scene when he must verbally defend his actions in a redneck, hate-filled church. Having Michael Caine in the cast is the icing on the cake.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
This was a interesting movie to watch,what i like about this movie is that the pace of it is not to fast and it is for people to understand what going on in the movie also the action in the movie is great and what it means to do teamwork in the movie it like a plot diagram in the movie also show a good father figure in the movie and their was some good technology use in this movie overall it a good movie to watch if you never watch a spy movie,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Loved it,"I loved this movie. It is so refreshing to see British comedy and British humour. British accents and British cockney slang. (Yes I am from England).It can be cheesy at times but hey, that made it even more comical.It's very different from other spy movies which I think makes it great. The language was a real shocker but I bloomin well found it hilarious.It is definitely worth watching. If you are into rather serious movies though i wouldn't watch it as it is quite comical and ridiculously violent and the characters are not like 'James Bond' or 'Bourne' or 'm'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Cleverly made propaganda, but fails as a movie","this is what a modern propaganda film looks like. from the opening shots of ""reel bad arabs"" getting tortured onwards, discerning moviewatchers know what they're in for. promotion of transhumanism, royalty and aristocracy, glamour shots of weapons caches, pretending that intelligence agencies are necessary to keep the 'peace' - it's all there. in fact the movie packs so many agendas into a non-stop barrage that you barely have time to register them all.from a propaganda standpoint, this is really well made. but as an entertaining movie it fails.one predictable plot development follows another as if the movie was assembled from pre-fab elements off the shelf. when i thought the movie should be about to end, i checked the remaining time and was amazed to find out that there was over an hour left! yawn!i'm sure the adolescent boys who are the target audience loved this film and are lining up to join this or that murdering intelligence outfit, expecting to skydive and f**k Scandinavian princesses up the a**.for the rest of us - if you want to see a good stylish action orgy, watch ""John Wick"" and forget about this insidious piece of propaganda.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
entertaining movie that doesn't always know when enough is enough,"Is this a spoof? I can see why it's getting described this way, but Kingsman isn't really all that different from its James Bond source material. Yes, there's the occasional mocking reference to James Bond, but the overall effect is more a slightly cheekier James Bond clone than an actual spoof. It's also not more than mildly amusing.But it is entertaining, mainly because of some terrific action scenes, some of which involve a woman amputee with swords instead of feet. These scenes are beautifully choreographed and often involve finding imaginative ways to knife and shoot people.Unfortunately, the movie is a little too in love with this stuff. At a certain point no amount of fancy choreography could distract me from the feeling that I had just seen something similar 15 minutes ago.The story is a rather messy one involving an evil billionaire fought by a mysterious spy organization made up primarily of lookalike square-jawed upper-class white guys bravely considering hiring a lookalike square-jawed lower-class white guy or a square-jawed upper-class white woman (who isn't lookalike because there's no one in the movie for her to look like).I kept wondering if the movie would make some sort of comment on the archaic nature of the organization, but since it didn't one tends to assume that the makers see nothing wrong with a powerful, secretive organization of white preppy guys. It makes an interesting contrast with the only important black character being a terrible person.Outside of that, I didn't really think much about the politics of Kingsman, although reviews like The Guardian's point out that it's pretty right wing overall. But because the movie is about 10% reactionary politics and about 80% stabbing people in the eye (the other 10% is for male bonding and dog walking) it's easy to ignore all that.For me, the issue with the movie is not its politics but it's inability to curtail its impulses. Watching a guy stylishly kill about a 100 people at once is pretty entertaining for about the first 25 people, and then feels like punishment. Cutting between a big action scene and a suspenseful high-altitude sequence sucks much of the pleasure out of both. The final battle's disco concept is clever but the flashy lights take away from the action.Still, Kingsman works more often than not, and while it's not consistently great, it has a decent mix of great and good moments and not that many bad ones. So overall, if you want mindless, violent action, this is worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Surprising Find,"This is one of those films that appeals to the younger audiences as well as 'traditional' fans of spy flicks. The humour is delightfully surprising, the action plentiful and easy to watch (unlike effects laden blockbusters like 'Transformers') and seeing Samuel L. Jackson tackle a quirky character was just icing on the cake.I don't usually roll in these circles, so I only ended up watching 'Kingsman' because my Dad chucked it on -- and I'm so inexpressibly happy I was too lazy to get up and ended up watching one of the best films of the Summer (if not the year).By far, one of the best films I've watched in a long while.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An Extremely Enjoyable Spy-Thriller!,"Kingsman may just be the most exciting and fun action movie of the year, just like last year's surprise hit, Guardians of the Galaxy. The brilliance of the movie rests in the hands of the writers and their tongue in cheek jokes poking fun at the James Bond franchise, as well as American culture, it's nothing short of amazing. They basically were saying that can do everything the Americans can do (action/over the top fighting), but also while maintaining a high level of sophistication while doing so.That being said, the action in the movie looked pretty great, lots of fluid/continuous action shots with some nice choreography. Surprisingly, almost all of the great action choreography comes from the Colin Firth's character! And of course like any spy movie out there, there need to be cool gadgets for our heroes, and Kingsman is no different. Everything in this movie is 'cool', from their clothing to their weapons (bulletproof suits, bulletproof umbrellas, grenade lighters), the Kingsman are basically the new James Bond.In the end, the movie knows exactly what is is trying to do, poke fun at classic spy thrillers while at the same time maintaining a new hip attitude, something today's younger generation would appreciate. And this is not your typical mind-numbing action thriller either, though not terribly original, Kingsman has a certain amount of style and flair to make it something special (that something special might be its political commentary). Kingsman is sure to be one of the best action movies of the year, no question about it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Solid and entertaining film...not your average spy movie,"Expect cheeky man whore spies and equally convoluted spy movie clichés? Kingsman: The Secret Service is not that type of spy movie.Slated for an American release in February amongst the lame romantic comedies and other dud-like films released in the dead of winter, Kingsman: The Secret Service shocks all by being quite a great movie.Kingsman is the name of the super secret espionage agency that polices the world and England in anonymity and without recognition. Only the most intellectual, moralistic, and talented are able to join this selectively reputable group. And, of course you must be invited and pass their highly competitive and rigorous training program. For this year's recruits, Galahad (played by Colin Firth) chooses Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), a rough around the edges hooligan with promise, to represent him amidst the rest of spy- hopefuls. Meanwhile a new 'bad guy' is ready to unleash his evil twisted plan and effectively destroy the world.We've all seen a spy movie, and if you haven't, you just simply must let me know where you found your rock. Gone are the tactical plot points and character archetypes, and instead Kingsman: The Secret Service is a refreshingly good, novel and entertaining film. The plot is linear, unlike most spy movies of recent time, and it makes for a very clean and captivating film.What is a spy movie without a protagonist, villain and killer action scenes? Colin Firth makes for the quintessential 'seasoned' spy while Taron Egerton makes for the perfect 'cheeky' anti-hero. Both have amazing chemistry and play well off one another while being engaging enough to continue garnering the audience's attention during solo scenes.And now, for the action. At first I thought Colin Firth had somehow managed to nonchalantly steal the award for best fight scene in an espionage film and then Taron Egerton showed up, a secondary dark horse in the running. The fight coordination is fast, concise and without flourish but stylized for a flare seemingly unique to Kingsman: The Secret Service.Admittedly, I was on the fence about this film going in. The trailer looked sick, and Colin Firth has never known to make a heinous misstepbut a spy movie in February that was more superficial and light than its dark and edgy peers? I was happily proved wrong, if you will, and Kingsman: The Secret Service is sure to entertain. I just hope there is a sequel/prequel.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of my all time Favorite films!,"I remember when I first saw this and my initial reaction being ""Wow"". I did (and still do) absolutely adore this film. It's funny, it's bloody, its brilliant. Every actor, whether it be professional actors like Colin Firth and Michael Caine or newcomers like Taron Egerton, does a brilliant job. (Sidenote: it's great to see Egerton is getting more and more roles now like Johnny in Sing or Elton 'Hercules' John in Rocketman) The action is brilliantly shot and edited, Sam Jackson plays a great villain and Sofia Boutella a great evil assistant. All in all, this film is FUNNY with GREAT ACTION and AWESOME ACTORS/ACTRESSES! I can't begin to explain my sheer love for this film, so if you want to know why, check out this 2015 masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Matthew Vaughn has made yet another amazing film,"My brother had told me about this a month or two before it was to come out and I watched the trailer and found myself really looking forward to the film. I love action films and the fact that my brother had described it as ""Alex Rider but better"" set my hopes pretty high and I was not disappointed.Matthew Vaughn is a great director and it is an unspoken rule in my house that if ""Stardust"" is on TV, we must watch it and I also loved ""Kick Ass"". This film had the slight gore of the latter, which is fine by me since I've always watched films like that, and the characters and aspects that don't turn out to be how they look on the surface. In my opinion, the perfect balance has been achieved between comedy, violence, action and even tragedy/seriousness. The actors used are amazing in their parts and it is a star studded cast of Michael Cain, Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson and Mark Strong but I think that Taron Egerton gives an amazing film debut performance.I've read some reviews where it has been described as ""laddish"" and brash but what else can you expect from a 15 rated spy film based on teenager from South London? In fact, Eggsy's contrast to the typical gentleman spy is what makes this film so good. We need more films that are like this one and push boundaries on the genres that we are used to.I came out of the cinema desperate to talk about it with my friends but none of them have seen it so I will have to think about how good it is by myself. It is also the first film that I have come out of cinema desperate to actually buy a copy of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
very enjoyable,"I was genuinely surprised by how entertaining this movie was. I don't share most people's apparent surprise by how effective Colin Firth was in the role of Harry Hart, a well spoken , immaculately dressed but utterly committed secret operative of The Kingsman. Harry has a conscience and a mistake made several years ago prompts the selection of a seemingly unlikely wannabe recruit to the Kingsman's ranks.The cast are all excellent, with young Taron Egerton seeming to be a star in the making. Only Mark Hamill is weak in his cameo.Production quality is excellent, the script is funny and there are some fantastic set pieces, with good pacing and a genuine sense of danger at the end.Films like Kingsman , The Man From UNCLE and Mission Impossible Rogue Nation merely serve to illustrate what a lazy uninspired cash grab Spectre was.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Good Movie, but Horrifying Ending","Interesting, just there are some parts which are just too much for me.Maybe it's because I'm the sort of person that sees things that other people don't, but the ending is just too terrifying. It has good morals such as it doesn't matter what your upbringing is to make a difference, or that we need to help the earth before it's too late, but the stuff near the end makes you wonder exactly how many people died due to the villain's plan. Also, it's revealed that the British Royal Family (the list says all their names) accept the villain's plan. Just...think about that during the implant scene near the end. On the whole, it is a perfect subversion of spy movies and gentleman spies, but those with a weak stomach might not like the church scenes or the ending.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""Do you like spy movies, Mr. De Vere?""","A lisp speaking billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine poses this question to a gentleman-spy Harry Hart, currently in disguise; which results in the smartest and funnest conversation you will see this year. From every frame of this film the love for old espionage and old James Bond films is tangible and mostly it is in this scene where the protagonist and and the antagonist of this film profess their mutual love of ""far-fetched theatrical plots"". Also a point is raised that the adventures were as good as the villain. The love for making films, having fun and letting yourself loose in the whirl of ideas can be felt throughout the whole film.The strength of any film is to have rightly cast actors. Taron Egerton, the most important piece of the puzzle, is the most promising talent to appear in the film since Jack O'Connel in Starred Up. He is charming, witty and just straight-up lovable. If the audience would not like him or sympathize with him the film would fail. Luckily, that is not the case. Colin Firth's talent is finally being used in the proper way. I finally started to enjoy Firth as an actor in last year's Woody Allen's Magic in the Moonlight and here he plays completely against type. The idea behind his casting was – Who is the least likely people would imagine as a spy?"" Colin Firth is delivers the performance of his life as the typical British gentleman with incredible fighting skills. Mark Strong is fun and entertaining as ever, this time differing himself with a Scottish accent. Samuel L. Jackson is the funniest and funnest villain you have seen in a long time. Matthew Vaughn decided to turn the villain formula on its head and Jackson spiced things up with a speech pattern, which results in the most ridiculous bad guy I have ever seen. I also always enjoy a villain with a noble cause. Sofia Boutella as Gazelle, Valentine's partner in crime is a great play on the typical henchman we see in the movies. Her having blades instead of legs is one wicked idea. Michael Caine of course is a national treasure and it is such a pleasure to see him in any film because no one has a screen presence as him.The camera work in Kingsman is the best I have seen since Bad Boys 2. The cinematography is fluent - no furious cuts, steady - no shaky camera, and is usually done in one take. The pivotal and arguably the bes scene of the film is the people are calling the 'church scene'. That scene is when everything cuts loose, people go berserk and generally mayhem ensues. This is the most violent, bloody action sequence you will see this year and it is all done in seemingly one take.That brings me to the highlight of the film. Since the film is not censored by American studio executives Matthew Vaughn was completely in hold of the reins. He could cut himself loose. Therefore one of the film's biggest appeal is its ultra violence. Now, I don't want to sound like some blood-lust psychopath but having people be killed in a movie without any blood or the consequences shown is wrong and it hurts the viewer's enjoyment (if I want to see Sylvester Stallone film I expect blood, which wasn't the case with Expendables 3) and it hurts the psyche of a potential young viewer who might get the wrong impression of violence.Vaughn's taste in music is very similar to mine. I have always dreamt of hearing Dire Straits's 'Money For Nothing' in a film and that is the song the film starts with. I was immediately in a paradise. The brilliantly put together soundtrack continues with Lynyrd Skynyrd's 'Free Bird' and KC & The Sunshine Band playing at the most inappropriate times resulting in a great comedic effect.Matthew Vaughn is ,for me, one of the smartest directors, since he is always is in sync with the audience's taste and its demand. So run to theater as fast as you can to see the best action film in years and the best movie of this year. I guarantee that you won't regret having an amazing time with this ultra violent, mega fun, self-referential spy action masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Fun, but not a bit awesome though it is sure trying...really hard!","Kingsman (2015)A huge spy spoof, lots of fun, with all the usual exotic tools and locations. And it includes a spy academy section where recruits perform bizarre and impossible feats.But not all spoofs are equal. This one is a bit mashed together, ranging from James Bond references (with Colin Firth playing that kind of spy in a suit) to kids being kids (racing cars around or taunting each other like they are in high school). There is a plot, for sure, and Samuel Jackson plays a quirky bad guy with a lisp out to ruin the world via everyone's cell phones.Things never get slow. Fight scenes are over the top improbable, not in the Jason Bourne way where skill prevails, nor even the James Bond way where cleverness and a couple of gadgets comes to play, but a combination of these with entertaining excess. One woman on prosthetic legs manages to leap, fly, and cut people in half with gymnastic (c.g.i.) aplomb.The principle character is one of the recruits, played by young British actor Taron Egerton, and for me he lacks screen presence. But we are meant to relate to him, for sure, a troubled kid with immense talent who gets a chance to fix his life by becoming a super spy. OK overall.Bottom line—a great fun movie for people who already like spy movies. I'd compare it to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" but that movie is far better than this one—funnier, better effects, better spoof referencing. ""Kingsman"" has lots of clever twists, so give it a go. But you might have a feeling along the way that it's all kind of ""stupid"" and a little disappointing. And you might give the parallel, zanier ""Spy"" a serious (and non- sexist) try...I liked it a lot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

In fact, it wouldn't be half the movie it is without the humour - it would just be another generic spy movie.

"Brash, inventive and highly entertaining.","After successfully dipping his toe in mainstream-friendly fare with X-Men: First Class, exuberant filmmaker Matthew Vaughn returns to non-PC mode with a subversive and sardonic flick that does for the spy genre what Kick-Ass did for the superhero genre. Attempting to deliver a genuinely great espionage flick whilst simultaneously parodying the genre it belongs to, the key to victory for Kingsman is its impeccable balancing of tones. Although Vaughn's arrogant gusto – displayed from the opening shot as we zoom up to an exploding Middle Eastern mansion – is a major contributor to the high level of entertainment on offer, the praise must be shared with regular screen writing collaborator Jane Goldman. The pair not only dish up witty, foul-mouthed banter and regular, cheeky movie references, but they also unleash gleefully irreverent commentary on subjects ranging from Westboro Church-style religious extremism to the ridiculous behaviour of the one-percenters. Even the action is hilarious. Vaughn designs his set pieces with equal parts flair and brutality; the violence is cartoonish yet graphic, the choreography is over-the-top yet exhilarating and a church-set rampage is one of the most downright awesome action sequences of recent times. The contrasts don't stop there either. Colin Firth is calm, cool and collected as gentleman spy Harry Hart and Mark Strong is unflappably controlled as fellow agent Merlin, whilst at the other end of the spectrum British youngster Taron Egerton is brash and self-assured as Firth's apprentice Eggsy and Samuel L. Jackson is in colourful lampooning form as megalomaniac Valentine. There are a few flaws that will irk those who don't appreciate Vaughn's cocksure direction, but with such inventive ultra-violent action, a rip-roaring soundtrack and adult humour aplenty, Kingsman is a big-screen delight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I have been waiting for a movie that has perfect and full of suspense and action and a good twist, this movie brought it all. It is perfect for the old and young crowds.

Her martial should be the best one in this film.Especially, the killing machine that Valentin uses to control and wipe out human is really cool, pop music can trigger the bomb chip inserted into the victims ' head and make them explode like a firecracker~Of course the training program is very hilarious, not to mention the underwater bedding scene or dog testing, however, Eggy ~ I don't know, not a big fan of him, tho he got potentials.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

There clearly is a very big love and respect for the spy genre and they clearly have very good control of their references to earlier works like James Bond, Jason Bourne and others. It is a very classic English spy, spiced up with some young British talent and an American villain wit a lisp :)All of the actors do a very fine job, the guys with the routine, Colin Firth, Michael Cain, Mark Strong and Samuel L.

Good movie but too violent,"I'd give this movie a 9 out of 10 if it was not for the gratuitous violence.This movie has a great script, a great cast, good acting, but needs about 30 minutes chopped to be really great.This script is fast paced with nods to some of the iconic spy film including of course James Bond. Surprisingly there were also some elements from the one TV show that Ian Fleming did. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. in the 1960s was originally titled Ian Fleming's Man form U.N.C.L.E.Where the movie fails is the level of violence. Scenes showing necessary violence to advance the plot go on much too long.Colin Firth was great as a classic Ian Fleming style agent. He would have made a great James Bond. Taron Egerton is excellent as a young man Firth mentors.Mark Strong who has a ""Q"" like roll and Michael Caine who plays the ""M"" like role in the movie are also excellent.If you like James Bond or the Man from U.N.C.L.E you should like this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Surprise Hit and Perfect Start to 2015's Slate of Spy Films,"I am a major unapologetic fan of the James Bond franchise and, as much as I love the latest serious Daniel Craig run of the series, KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is apparently the 007 film I've been craving since Roger Moore finished his run in 1985. It takes all the most playful elements of Moore's 007 films, gives them modern sensibilities, and ramps up the stylized action under the direction of Matthew Vaughn. I've enjoyed Vaughn's work since LAYER CAKE and I'll admit I was worried about KINGSMAN. Leading up to its release, I'd seen little to no promotion for it and it was apparently based on a comic property with which I was unfamiliar. To top it off, it was scheduled for release in the month of February, a notorious cinematic dumping ground. But, man, I was wrong to doubt it. Turns out, KINGSMAN is one of my favorite movies of 2015, a year swamped with spy films. The Kingsman are a secret organization of wealthy gentlemen dating nearly a century and their mission is to keep the world safe from danger utilizing seemingly endless resources. Cool gadgets and impeccable style without the hindrance of answering to the government and MI6. Each agent is code- named for one of the knights in King Arthur's court, and they operate out of a tailor shop on Savile Row in London. As the movie begins, a threat emerges in the form of a world-famous tech billionaire whose plan for saving the world from environmental destruction means eliminating its over-population problem.It all begins with the kidnapping of a famed environmental scientist/university professor, played by none other than Mark Hamill. A botched rescue attempt leaves a Kingsman agent dead and we then jump into the process of finding a new Lancelot. Harry Hart/Galahad (Colin Firth) recruits young Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) and convinces him to go through the recruitment campaign where he will compete with nearly a dozen other candidates for the position. This proves to be a challenge for Eggsy, as he's a street thug (albeit one with above average intelligence and Olympic-level gymnastic skills) going up against Ivy Leaguers with stiff upper lips and wealthy backgrounds. Hart feels compelled to care for Eggsy because it was Eggsy's father that saved his life by giving his own on a mission years earlier in the Middle East. Hart becomes a sort of surrogate father to Eggsy, teaching him in the ways of acting a gentleman and giving the kid confidence to compete. Firth and Egerton are a solid team in the film, and Firth's performance leads me to believe he could've been a fantastic 007 if he'd been given the chance. With support from Mark Strong as the Kingsman's tech wizard Merlin and Michael Caine as the commanding officer of the organization (dubbed Arthur, naturally), this movie's got some serious acting chops in it. But a proper spy/action film is only as strong as its villain and, when that villain is Samuel L. Jackson, you know it's going to be fun.KINSGMAN has a perfect blend of action and humor. It's definitely a lot edgier in the comedy than 007 films have ever been, seeing as how KINGSMAN totally embraces its R-rating. At the end of a 007 film, we get a tender embrace under the sheets, a cheesy pun, and an ""Oh, James"" from the leading lady. In KINGSMAN, the gorgeous woman prepares for mounting like a dog in heat because, well, he did save the world as promised. This movie is a jacked-up love letter to the fun 007 movies of the Connery and Moore eras, parodying elements with a knowing nod and taking everything a step further because they can. The violence certainly takes full advantage of the R-rating, with a church slaughter halfway through the film spilling loads of blood and establishing itself as the most fun scene of any movie in 2015 (fantastically set to the tune of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Freebird""). The Kingsman may not appear to be much of a threat in their tailored suits with their proper manners, but these dudes can open a can of whoop a**. I would never expect much from Colin Firth but he's got a few scenes in this movie proving that Galahad is not a man to be trifled with. I could go on about KINGSMAN but I'll sum it up with this: the movie is just a crazy amount of fun and there is extra enjoyment to be had for fans of classic 007 who'll see a lot of the tropes toyed with here.One last note: I really, really hope KINGSMAN 2 brings in Roger Moore in a supporting role, either as the villain or the head of the Kingsman. It would just be perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Total Nonsense! Be wary of rigged IMDb reviews for this movie!,"Having built high expectations from an almost 10 out of 10 IMDb rating and portrayed as a great spy thriller in the reviews we went to watch the movie but were extremely and totally disappointed and disgusted with everything in the movie. The storyline and direction were aimless and weak, the actors were made to show off their horribly cheap and duplicate quality James bond type weaponry, tricks, and style. The movie's plot and screening seems so stupid that the director would have been better off creating a spoof for a James Bond type movie instead. Anyway such movies always get made, but what I am most disappointed about is the fact that the IMDb reviews & ratings were completely rigged. IMDb you need to watch out for such flaws in your feedback system 'cos that will bring down the rating of your service in process.

The script is well written, so tight and connected ... complicated yet so easily understandable. when you see the Genre is ""Action | Adventure | Comedy | Crime"" well it is literally all of that combined and each has it's tangible Obvious part in the movie. Didn't have so much Fun and Excitement like this in ages !!! The first fight scene is amazing... the scene of the church fight is spot on ... the last fight of Eggsy my goodness, indescribable. Eggsy's facial expressions were priceless.Out to the cinematography and visual effects .. Just WOW ,, the video game camera like !!! new and successfully used ,, the Slow- Motion scenes were PeRfEcT,, i honestly only saw something like it in Sherlock Holmes movies fight scenes and as one would think it would make the movie slow and boring .. Gosh it made it look Original and even more precision and perfection,,, even the soundtracks and SoundMix... In the last couple of scenes my god they're brilliantly genius.As for the Cast ,,, Bravo... So many Names ,, didn't see that much of names since .. i don't know !!!

How to Recruit Socio- and Psychopaths for the Secret Services.,"Obviously this movie was written on the order of psychopaths, executed by psychopaths -or at least sociopaths- to attract those who would even kill their pet to get a job as paid assassin, and should feel bad if their conscience told them not do it.Christianity should also mercilessly be rooted out, as Christians are all racist conspiracy nuts.But you become part of the ""elite"" with a tailor made English suit just for you, and what could a boy with a inferiority complex find more attractive? I guess this is a whole new level of making a recruiting film for the secret services. I cannot imagine anything morally lower in this genre.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Truly Great take on a classic Genre,"Man I am so behind the times - Why has it taken so long for me to see this movie?Lets get the way as this film is EXCELLENT!Samuel L. Jackson is HILARIOUS!Colin Firth is simply Colin Firth but god damn does it work... I never had him pictured as an action hero but he pulls it off brilliantly!The film is just plain enjoyable... It takes all the greatest Bond Movie Tropes and turns them into a thoroughly entertaining movie... While at the same time throwing a lot of real life questions into the mix... Not going to go too much into that as it would spoil the movie.So for an Excellent Movie - Why only a 7?Well, yeah there are bad points and here its the old classic of Shaky Cam... I can forgive it as this was 2014 and this was pretty much a staple of most movies back then, but it makes fight scenes very hard to follow.The action IS enjoyable, but also somewhat too chaotic at times...And some of the editing is DEPLORABLE!!! Why have 3 cuts when you can have 15?No Seriously!!! Some of the action scenes cut between two different scenes up to 15 TIMES!!! The Church scene cuts between Samuel L. Jackson and the main fight over and over and over... And to be honest there is just no need for it!With that said, its a brilliantly written comedy, and has a reasonably good pace... A must see if I am honest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Go see it. NOW.,"This is definitely going on my top ten list of favorite movies. Colin Firth is amazing in Kingsman, as well as Taron Egerton. Also, it's fun and humorous. It's filled with amazing action sequences. For a R-rated action movie, the blood is not too gore-y. I definitely thought this movie was going to be more bloody than it actually was. The aspect of being a gentleman spy seems very interesting, not to mention the puppies.It does seem a bit over the top at times (good or bad depending on how you look at it). Samuel L. Jackson's lisp does distract you a bit. And the last scene, wow.In conclusion, this is a brilliant and by far, Matthew Vaughn's best film. Maybe he could top it with a sequel?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Not many new ideas, but more than enough fun","(67%) It doesn't break any new ground, it's very childish, silly, cartoonish; and overall just yet another throwaway action movie. But dear god it's superbly entertaining right from the very beginning to the very final frame. This resembles everything that the awful Avengers (not the Marvel one) movie should have been, with its touches of the Austin Powers movies, and of course the Bond films. If this had been released at around the same time as the poor Quantum of solace movie then it would have been the only case when a part spoof picture would have actually been better than the film being spoofed; but as Skyfall was fantastic then this doesn't get that most rare accolade. The cast is strong, I warmed to the characters, the direction is solid; while the action sequence in the church is worth the ticket price alone. All in all a near perfect spy popcorn movie with plenty of tricks up its tailored sleeve.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A secret with a twist,"This movie took a different approach on the usual secret service spy related movie, and it definitely paid off. Instead of seeing an experienced spy, it was a much younger group of new recruits who would go through training to become the one of the experienced elite ones. It was cool to see the beginning times for an agent in the secret service.Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton, is one of the young recruits for the Kingsman Secret Service. His father was a former spy for the Kingsman, but he was killed during a mission that went wrong. Eggsy was recruited by his father's partner Harry Hart, played by Colin Firth. Hart felt obligated to look after Eggsy because of his father's death.The training challenges were pretty intense and demanding. They were fast paced and rapidly built to high suspense. The fighting choreography was extremely innovative by mixing in parkour throughout the scenes.Overall, this movie surpassed any expectations I had for it based on what was shown in the previews.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
decent entertainment,"""Kingsman"" is loosely based on the comic book series ""The Secret Service"" but was adapted by Matthew Vaughn, the man who directed the film version of ""Kick-Ass"" . This production tweaks the Bond formula with some polished style, a lot dark humor and a bit of well-groomed action. As with ""Kick-Ass,"" there's a strong underlying nastiness but also a wicked sense of fun. This can create some dissonance for some people finding it uneasy to laugh at violence at a point and then find out a character they like was killed in the next sequence. The violence is over the top for the most part, and rapidly cut with a lot of blood to keep it all at a safe distance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Stylish, obscene, hilarious and British","""Do you like thpy movieth?"" lisps Samuel L Jackson's megalomaniac Valentine, to Colin Firths suited and booted (Oxfords, preferably) Harry Hart. ""I find them all a little dramatic for my liking"" he croons in the most perfect British accent, ""give me a far-fetched theatrical plot any day"". This one sentence explains everything you need to know about Kingsman; a gloriously over the top tribute, that takes huge risks due to its audacious attitude, and thankfully the risks pay off. From the director who made an 13 year old girl say THAT word in Kick Ass, it's not surprising that Kingsman is just as foul-mouthed and ultra-violent. With Vaughn's signature style of a comic book look and feel, he cranks up the coolness factor and puts you right in the middle of the action from start to finish. Vaughn directs with such enthusiasm and skill, it's hard not to love anything he does. Colin Firth is superb as the well groomed but deadly Harry Hart. He sheds his stiff, British exterior and embraces his new role, clearly having the time of his life. Firth's chemistry with Egerton is that of a father/son relationship and is truly lovely to watch. Taron Egerton is absolutely brilliant as the teen hooligan Eggsy. With his cheeky accent and potty mouth, he's perfectly cast and cements himself as a promising newcomer of 2015. Kingsman not only looks good, but is hugely entertaining, stylishly written, obscenely filthy, extremely funny and brilliantly British.Please vote for me (Jordan Thornell) in Vue Cinema's film critic comp on their website!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not your usual spy movie,Kingsman the secret service is a movie filled with action violence comedy and so much more its not like James bond movies where most spy movie fans originated their love for the genre its unique and that's why i love it. Amazing performances from Colin Firth and Taren Egerton who was a new comer to Hollywood and this was his first movie. Sofia Boutella was great as Gazelle and the stand out performance was from Samuel L Jackson as the bad guy Valentine who was threatening and funny at the same time kinda like Dr Evil. Overall Kingsman the secret service was an amazing movie with the potential to do some amazing things and hopefully this series will grow.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Rushed Plotline with Cheesy Writing,"The concept for the movie is great. Although the writing is where it falls short. The plotline is extremely rushed and ends up jumping around so much that you don't really know what's going on. I think the best way to sum up the movie is if Austin Powers and Tarantino had a sloppy 1 night stand.I don't feel as though I wasted my time watching it, but I certainly don't think I'll be watching the sequel.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Gentlemanly Awesome,"Kingsman is a nod to the old spy thrillers, with its crazy gadgets, beautiful women, crazy bad guys... but turning it on its head in the best way possible.I simply could not take my eyes off the screen. First we get some back story, a brief introduction to the Kingsman and how they kick-ass while wearing a suit (totally useless in real life fights, with all ties that can be pulled and pants that prevent any high kicking, but extremely awesome in movie fights). Than we meet Eggsy, a down on his luck kid that shows a hidden potential, and how he wants to turn his life around. He gets chosen and bam! Training. I just love training scenes. From Jackie Chan doing sit-ups upside down or Luke carrying Yoda (Mark Hamill is on this movie), give a few good training scenes and I know the master is a bad-ass and the student will become a bad-ass.This film wouldn't work if we didn't connect with Eggsy, but Taron Egerton does a fine job. Not only him, but Colin Firth is great as the ""Mr. Miyagi"". I've never seen him as an action hero, but he takes part in the best fight scenes in recent memory. Part of the credit though goes to Matthew Vaughn and his great directing. The way he plays with the camera, not using all that ""shaky cam"" that is all the rage these days, but actually immersing the audience and showing the important parts makes the punches all the more enjoyable.Also, Kudos for Samuel L. Jackson for the role of the megalomaniac villain, and all the supporting cast like Mark Strong.And last, but not least, the story is amazing. The script is simple in the beginning, with the underdog story we all know and love. There is nothing wrong with going for the known archetypes, you just have to do it well. And this movie nails it, while also creating something new. The ending of this movie is just delightfully surprising. A great way of twisting the spy genre.All in all, a great movie experience. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"An Uncensored Bond, for a New Generation","Comic book and graphic novel adaptations are something of a speciality for Director Matthew Vaughn. He has proved his worth with the ultra-violent 'Kick-Ass', the superior 'X-Men First Class' and now the stylish 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'. He is in my eyes one of the most original Directors working today. 'Kingsman' sees him at the top of his game and with the upcoming release of the twenty fourth Bond film later this year, what better time to release this spy parody.Now, the English have had a poor track record when it comes to spy spoofs. If 'Johnny English' was a guilty pleasure then 'Storm breaker' was definitely a disappointment to say the least. But 'Kingsman' works so well on multiple levels and even the plot is pleasurable.With the untimely death of two Kingsman agents, the others working in the field must find two suitable replacements. One of the candidates happens to be the son of a Dead agent from a botched mission that took place in 1997. He is Gary Unwin or 'Eggsy' if you are his friend. First time actor Taron Egerton who plays him with edge and conviction, if this is his first role imagine what he could accomplish in the future. The candidates participate in the ""most dangerous job interview"" they will ever get. Eventually Gary takes up the role of a Kingsman agent who is taught their prestigious ways by the smart and very talented Harry Hart played by Colin Firth. Whom still proves that he has got it, even if he is in his mid-fifties. I have heard that the majority of the action scenes he undertook himself and therefore I have to hand it to the man.Once the agents are assembled they must take down Valentine a villain with a lisp. Samuel L Jackson takes up the role. I would have thought that he would be unable to impress me as he is always able to outshine other major players. But, he proves that he is still one of the most dependable and bankable actors of this generation. Valentine hatches a plot to rid the world of those whom he deems are less than worthy to inhabit it. As he realises that the population is increasing the rate of global warming and must be taken care of. He wishes to carry out this plot through biological warfare with the help of amputee Gazelle whom has razor sharp legs that can pierce human flesh with ease. What follows is one of the best spy films and parodies ever created. This is because every single detail and element is handled with grace.One of the most important factors for a parody is the laughs. 'Kingsman' always delivers and makes me ever so thankful that the BBFC did not butcher this film and make it a 12A instead of the intended 15 certificate. It would lose half of its essence and almost every gag would land flat. Thankfully they do not and I had to use my arms to keep myself sitting straight and stop from falling face forwards onto the floor. Whether it be when the film takes the mickey out of the James Bond franchise, Valentine struggling with his ever so obvious lisp or the song that the villain plays to commence the end of the world, the film never falters where jokes are concerned.I will be brief here because with Vaughn behind the camera you know that the cinematography will be dazzling. But, also he is a Director who knows how to orchestrate fight scenes well, which is becoming increasingly rare for action films. One of the techniques that he uses to maximum effect is speeding up and slowing down the action. We get to see reactions more clearly and the full power of a single punch is never wasted. Rest assured the action is photographed spectacularly well and never descends into unwatchable shaky camera.The whole film maintains a sense of joy that is palpable throughout the two hour run time. The film is a sugar rush of the highest class. For the faint of heart it may be too much to handle; with the majority of characters free loading F bombs in every other sentence, heads exploding like shrapnel (to be honest it does have hundreds of deaths) and jokes about sex. But for others it will be a thrill ride that no other film can replicate or capture.For all action and spoof fans to miss out on 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' would be sacrilege to your country. Suit up, relax and freak out as Vaughn delivers a high octane, frequently funny and incredibly entertaining treat for teenagers and over around the whole globe. This is a younger, more daring and uncensored Bond for the new generation. If this was to be the next super spy franchise it would be joyous cause for celebration indeed. When it comes to furious action and elating energy, nobody does it better than Vaughn.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Uneven, but certainly not dull","Sitting down to watch ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"", I had no prior knowledge of the movie except that it was a modern film take on the idea of the British secret service. I don't know what I was expecting, but I didn't expect what I saw. I am not saying that this is a terrible movie. The production values are slick, there are some exhilarating action sequences, and the movie thankfully does not take things completely seriously. However, the comedy and the action really does not mix. The comedy is really goofy at times, while the action is really hard core at times, and the two extremes don't really mix. And at over two hours in length, the movie goes on too long. (I should add that even at that length, there are a few minor plot gaps that suggest some linking footage was cut out or not filmed at all.) But as I said in my summary line, I was not bored. This movie is a matter of taste; I can see why some people would not like it. Who would like it? I think those who are fans of the sometimes over the top action/comedy cinema coming out of Hong Kong would best appreciate this film.

Double-oh-six-and-a-half,"Co-written by Mrs Jonathan Ross (Jane Goldman) and director Matthew Vaughan, this is a smutty action comedy from the FAST AND FURIOUS school. Megabucks have clearly been spent on the fight scenes and CGI. Colin Firth and Mark Strong are visibly enjoying letting their hair down (Mark of course is bald), although Michael Caine looks as if he's uncomfortable slumming (not for the first time, Michael: we haven't forgotten Jaws 3D, hardly your finest hour).Taron Egerton, more Bourne than Bond, appears to have been cloned from Daniel Craig. Samuel L. Jackson's lisping zillionaire philanthropist and would-be world dominator Valentine is presumably spoofing Javier Basrdem in SKYFALL. Valentine's female sidekick runs on Pistorius-like blades that are more lethal than Oddjob's bowler hat, of fond recall.The death toll is like a war movie. The level of violence and the f-word quotient are probably way too high, but KINGSMAN is firmly pitched at the teenager in all of us; it certainly found the teenager in me and my companion, both of us clearly not kids but more clearly still kids at heart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Great, funny film. Worth a watch!","After seeing the trailer I thought I'd enjoy the first half cos of the 'joining the spy' bit and not so much the second half because of lots of action scenes, which I enjoy but not massively keen on - BUT I was very surprised that I enjoyed the entire film and the action scenes didn't override the film and were very good and had some very funny bits. Colin Firth was very good, he played Colin Firth (with extra added spyness) to a tee and was very enjoyable. I found Samuel L Jackson's lisp a little bit annoying but if he hadn't had it he would have been WAY more scary as a villain! He was very funny, too! The scenery was impressive and there were great swooping shots and you could actually see what was happening (not too fast).I really liked the whole 'knight' thing and that they had Arthurian code names.

A Semi-Lighter Side of Being a Spy,"Kingsman is a spy movie light. It is a small tribute to James Bonds' movies and those like it; meaning the dapper spy with all of the latest gadgets. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously (which is good) and that was supported by the fact that Samuel L. Jackson's character, Valentine, had a laughable lisp.The Kingsmen are a group of elite English spies. They are extremely secretive and unknown yet they are probably the most effective group of spies and killers on the planet. As members leave or die off they are replaced by qualified spies and gentlemen. This movie is about an unlikely person for the role of gentleman spy getting a shot to prove himself while the Kingsmen try to stop a plot to cleanse the world of people.There is a lot of unbelievable action, jaw-dropping fight scenes with surprisingly little eye candy. Being that it is a British spy movie I expected the token beauty whom the super spy seduces. That's not to say that they didn't throw in any gratuitous nudity, they just waited until the very end to do it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Slick Send-Up of Spy Films and a World Going Mad,"Director Matthew Vaughn continues His Winning Streak with this Ultra-Violent Send-Up of the Slick Spy Movie.

That may be the One Time that the Director's usual Disregard for Good Taste got the better of His Trademark Avoidance of Sensibility.Some May Point to the Church Slaughter as another, but that is Not Meant to be so Personally Invasive, more like a Parody of Hyper-Hypocritical Comeuppance.Overall, the Movie cannot be denied its Fresh Fervor and Willingness to Step, No Leap, Over the Line of what has Come Before.

Though some of these moments were not always too my liking, it's hard to deny the pleasure you have watching this movie. The makers of the movie were all in great form: Millar's script is craziness at its best, and it is paired with Vaughn's superb eye and perfect pacing.

A new kind of spy movie,"If you said that 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was like a 'Bond film' then you'd only be partly right. Yes, it's a 'spy movie,' yes you have a 'super villain' trying to basically take over the world and, yes, you have a 'gentleman spy' ready and waiting to stop him. Yet, for all its 'Bond-like' traits, I just can't really liken Kingsman to a Bond movie. It's not better or worse, just a different beast altogether.It's different because – unlike Bond – it doesn't just concentrate on one area of the spy genre. Our gentleman spy in question is played expertly by Colin Firth and, if the film-makers had chosen to do so, they could have easily concentrated on his efforts to stop our (lisping!) super villain, Samuel L Jackson, from getting away with his dastardly plans. However, like I say, that's only part of the story. Mr Firth, Colin Firth, decides to take on a protégé in the form of a young lad from the rough end of London and train him up in the ways of the Force (in Star Wars terms, anyway). So, not only do we have a spy movie, but with a large helping of teenage coming-of-age thrown in there (oh, and the obligatory teenage romance to satisfy the 'Twilight generation'). Now, if you're already picking up on my distain for twinkling vampires and schoolgirls who don't seem able to smile or close their mouths, then you're probably right. I'm not a fan of teenage love stories and Kingsman could quite easily have fallen down here in my estimation. However, luckily, it's not the case and the 'teenage element' is actually done pretty well and hopefully won't alienate too many of the older generation (like me, for example).I won't go into too many details about the plot. If you've seen one Bond film (or any other spy movie worth its name) then you'll know. The plot isn't important, only that you know that it's done very well. And, I should mention a special nod to the 'action scenes.' I'm not entirely sure how they're done, but they're damn awesome and stylishly put together.If you like the slightly tongue-in-cheekness of old 'pre-Daniel Craig' Bond then you should enjoy Kingsman. It has decent performances, stylish action, over-the-top baddies (seriously... a woman with giant razor blades for legs has to be straight out of the Dr No era!) and even a touch of humanity and uplifting character development. A surprise package.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.""","British spies are so cool. They always dress sharp. They act like perfect gentlemen. Every little thing on their persons is some kind of hidden weapon or device. They always defeat the henchmen, save the world from megalomaniac supervillains, and get the girl in the end. With Kingsman, Matthew Vaughn uses the standard British spy movie schtick to distill all the best elements of his previous films: a little bit of the training scenes from X-Men: First Class, a large portion of the ultraviolence and attitude from Kick-Ass, maybe a drop of the hard-hitting drama from Layer Cake, and voila, we have a martini that's far more shaken than stirred.Even though the film may seem derivative, it's still a total blast from beginning to end. The action is very stylish and incredible; the fight scenes are expertly-choreographed and filmed in a way that shoves it all in your face (in a manner that reminded me much of the way The Raid 2 was staged). As the film progresses, less and less is held back, and the film paints a colorfully brutal picture of the fantasy of being a British spy. A few scenes - the pub fight, the church scene, the fight with the main henchman, and a certain scene involving microchip implants - are incredible on their own and make the movie a must-see for anybody who can handle them.I thought the story was good and well-told. It wastes little time in establishing a great cast of characters we can relate to and enjoy, going so far as weaving inspiring themes of what being a gentleman really means. The story strikes an excellent pace and it shows exactly everything it needs to for the plot to unfold and reach its incredible climax. It is a very dense and fulfilling tale.The subtext, unfortunately, is where certain wires are crossed and it can leave some viewers feeling confused. This is a movie that often mocks the conventions of other spy movies (including the original James Bond series), but the film plays out in all the same conventions, making it feel rather hypocritical. Same goes for the violence; the film's shock value should make it appalling, but most of it could be seen as a glorification. Kick-Ass had these same issues as well, but the contrast between tone and content made it more successful at being darkly comedic. With Kingsman, the contrast is not as strong, and it's hard to tell what stance it's supposed to take on these issues.The film looks sharp, with decent photography and very punchy editing. A few of the action scenes are pretty fast-cut and have some shaky cam, but this is a rare case where I felt the frenetic nature of the scenes worked to the film's advantage. Acting is swell; the whole cast is colorful and enjoyable to watch. There is a ton of unnecessary swearing, but otherwise the script is great. This production uses good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are sometimes good, sometimes so-so. The soundtrack is great too.Kingsman is more outlandish than James Bond, gutsier than Jason Bourne, meaner than Jack Bauer. It's also colorful and nutty, a bit like 1998's Avengers, but far more successful at it. What makes it work is that it still has loads of style and action, but still tells a decent story. If you can handle the film's extremities, it's well worth the time.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A hilarious & action packed homage to spy films.,"Kingsman: The Secret Service tells the story of Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin(Taron Egerton). Eggsy is an unrefined but gifted street kid with a lot of potential. However, Eggsy uses his intelligence & talents to get himself into sticky situations. A spy named Harry Hart/Galahad(Colin Firth) who is part of a secret spy organization, sees Eggsy's potential & recruits him into the organization's cutthroat training program to become the next Kingsman. Meanwhile, a tech genius named Valentine(Samuel L. Jackson), has twisted plans that could put the whole world in serious danger.Kingsman: The Secret Service is an outstanding & flawless film. I haven't had this much fun watching a movie, in quite some time. This movie is full of action, witty one-liners & is also thrilling & suspenseful. Kingsman also has numerous memorable quotes like, ""This is not that kind of movie, bruv"". Basically, this movie is a complete package. The action sequences are intense, realistic, slick & stylish. This movie has tons of violence & gore & is not meant for the faint of heart & people who get squeamish at the sight of blood. There is one set piece in the movie that is out of this world! I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Matthew Vaughn has outdone himself. Kingsman: The Secret Service is better than Kick-Ass & is on par with X-Men: First Class. A note on the performances. Colin Firth is spectacular as Harry Hart/Galahad. Firth shines in his first major action role. Taron Egerton is brilliant as Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin. Egerton is extremely likable as the unorthodox lead of the film. Samuel L. Jackson is hysterical as Valentine. Jackson's antagonist is one of a kind & beats several Bond villains. Mark Strong is brilliant as Merlin. Michael Caine is great as Arthur. Sophie Cookson is good as Roxy. Sofia Boutella is impressive as Gazelle. The supporting characters are amazing too. Kingsman: The Secret Service is a must watch, especially for action-comedy & spy movie buffs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

However, she is not feeling very sociable and snaps at him, which results in Hart giving the medal to her son Eggsy (Alex Nicolov). Hart points out a phone number engraved on the back of the medal an tells Eggsy mother to use it and tells her the coded message she should use.The movie then jumps some seventeen years, and sees another agent, Lancelot(Jack Davenport), killed by a female assassin known as Gazelle(Sofia Boutella), who works for the billionaire (Richmond Valentine (Samuel L Jackson). Meanwhile, Eggsy (Taron Egarton) is finding life hard, living with his mother, young half sister and nasty stepfather.Despite having many qualities, Eggsy feels disillusioned and opts out of his training with the Royal Marines. He ends up being arrested for car theft and rings the number on his medal, which finds him being released. Standing outside the police station is Hart, who invites Eggsy to a local pub for a drink. Hart tells Eggsy about a secret organisation known as Kingsman that he and Eggsy's father worked for.

Eggsy, together with Roxy and Merlin, then feel obliged to go and shake things up at Valentines secret hide out.The Kingsman is an action movie directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Kick Ass, X Men: First Class, Stardust). The movie takes you into a gadget filled make believe secret service organisation. The sets are quite impressive as are the weapons and gadgets.

A Brilliant Blend of Action and Comedy with a Distinct British Flair,"'The Secret Service' is a rare gem in the action-comedy genre, delivering a refreshing and distinctively British touch that sets it apart from other spy films. In a cinematic landscape where few movies strike the perfect balance between action and humor, *Kingsman* stands out with its masterful scripting. The film expertly keeps the action intense and the comedy sharp, never allowing one to overshadow the other.The storyline is tightly woven, with a plot that consistently surprises and entertains. The ending is particularly satisfying, tying up all loose ends and connecting every plot point seamlessly, leaving the audience with a sense of closure that is often missing in films of this genre.However, the movie isn't without its minor flaws. One of the rejected Kingsman applicants is dismissed without a memory wipe, which feels like a significant oversight given the organization's secrecy. Despite this, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' remains an exhilarating and stylish film that successfully redefines the spy genre, offering both thrilling action sequences and clever, well-timed humor. A must-watch!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A must see action/Spy film,"Growing up one of my favorite franchises to watch was James Bond. A world based in reality, but with all these over the top gadgets, weapons, cars and villains. The kingsman did an amazing job at recreating the tone of these classic movies while putting this gratuitously violent, original spin on the spy thriller. The Kingsman is a story adapted from a Mark Miller comic book. This comic book tone was that insanely crazy quality that I think set this film apart from other spy franchises. Another aspect of this film I enjoyed, was the wink to the fact that Director Matthew Vaughn New how over the top this film was. The fact that he did this made the moments in this film that felt campy and a little cheesy feel fun while paying homage to the stereotypical spy film. The things I really liked the most in this film were the performances, the villains and the action. it's funny because these aspects if not done right could have made this unbelievably stupid. They stayed with a consistent tone and they really pulled it off. This main character eggsie is played by up and comer Teron Edgerton. This dude is awesome, he did such a good job. Colin Firth did a great job also, playing a mentor figure, and his action sequence is absolutely amazing. It is one of the highlights of the film. You will know what I am talking about when you watch it. Samuel L Jackson is the man, who else can play a sociopathic genius with a lisp and still make it his own.. At first I really did not care for his character but as the film progresses you end up think this villain is absolutely hilarious. I don't think anyone could pull that off as good as him. Besides Taron Edgertons character Samuel L Jackson was my favorite character in this film. I wrote in my marvel piece last week about what makes a good villain. The idea of a villain that thinks they are bettering the world by their actions, creates a whole other layer of evil. As over the top, and as crazy as his character was, this was the of the layer that made him a great villain. The only complaint I have about the kingsman is really minor. There were definitely a couple of occasions were I felt the film was a little corny. I will say this, those moments seem to pass quickly, and I mostly felt this in the beginning 20 minutes, before you really figure out the tone of the film. These moments are there to remind you that this is the tone of the movie. Overall. I really enjoyed this film. It was a total throw back to those over the top, 60's and 70's outrageous spy films that we all know and love. Cool gadgets, good action, it's very, very violent. Teron Edgerton was just awesome he played a good action star while being able to portray a relatable character with depth and substance. I highly recommend The Kingsman: The Secret Service. I give it a solid 8 out of 10. I can't say it enough if you like over the top violence and you like spy movie you will definitely dig this",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Bloody good fun,"'Kingsman: The Secret Service' walks a very fine line between parody and homage, never straying too far to one side or the other. Its tongue is certainly in its cheek, but never sticking out toward the audience.Clearly director Matthew Vaughn was attempting to fashion a spy film that brings back a sense of fun reminiscent of the James Bond films of yore; even going meta on occasion to drive the point home. But even though it wears its absurdity on its sleeve, 'Kingsman' still manages to sneak in a genuine character arc and by the end we genuinely want our heroes to save the day. It's a heck of a balancing act Vaughn has done here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
License to Thrill,"Kingsman is a thrilling ride from start to finish, packed with action, humor and style. Directed by Matthew Vaughn, this spy flick is a breath of fresh air in a genre often bogged down by clichés and predictability.It follows the journey of Eggsy, a street-smart kid from London who gets recruited into a top-secret spy organization. It's like James Bond meets The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, with a healthy dose of British charm and swagger thrown in for good measure. Taron Egerton's portrayal of Eggsy is a revelation, combining wit, charm, and just the right amount of badassery to make him a truly unforgettable protagonist.But what really sets Kingsman apart is its irreverent sense of humor and tongue-in-cheek attitude. From the over-the-top action sequences to the witty one-liners, the film doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. It's like watching a Bond film on steroids, with more explosions, more gadgets, and more banters than you can shake a martini at.Visually, the film is a feast for the eyes, with slick production design, stylish costumes, and enough gadgetry to make Q jealous. The action sequences are like a choreographed ballet of destruction, with every punch, kick and explosion executed with precision and flair. The stunning cinematography and jaw-dropping special effects are top-notch, rivaling anything Hollywood has to offer.With its slick style, sharp wit, and heartwarming moments, it's sure to leave you shaken, stirred, and wanting more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An exceptional awesome British action flick,I originally saw in the theater I just wasn't reviewing at the time and now that a new Kingsman is coming out this year I figured I'd rewatch it. Kingsman: The Secret Service is an exhilarating original spy adventure with great touches of comedy and glorious stunts! I love how Samuel L.

Bond Meets Ender's Game Meets Trading Places Meets 2012: Has Good Moments But the Violence Was Insufferable,"""Kingsman"" is not only a story about a young lad being trained in an ultra-secret service agency similar to Mi6 of the James Bond universe. Kingsman is also about satirizing Bond and other similar action fair. Other films are directly or indirectly referenced in ""Kingsman"", sometimes to good effect, other times with mixed results. So is the film about it's story/plot or its references to other cinematic shoot-em-up films of similar ilk? Rather depends upon how you look at it. For my money, the endless references to action cinema did become a bit overdone.""Kingsman"" incorporates two plots which become intertwined by the end. The first, and most interesting, is the training of a youth on the eve of adulthood. ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) is the son of a Kingsman who sacrificed himself to save his colleagues on his mission when his son was only a toddler. One of the operatives, code named Galahad (Colin Firth) gives the toddler a medallion. The late father was code named Lancelot. The film then fast-forwards many years later and now Eggsy is near adulthood but not very mature. He encounters Galahad who offers him a spot in a program with other recruits designed to train future kingsmen, in particular to fill the vacant spot of Lancelot. The training program I thought was the strongest part of the film as the coaches/trainers use no-win scenarios to challenge their recruits into finding creative solutions.The other story involves a billionaire, Richmond Valentine (Samuel Jackson), who has some strange ideas about defeating global warming. He makes endless speeches to both audiences and individuals with a lisp. Also in Jackson's service, as either an employee or slave, is Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) who sports razor sharp blades in place of normal feet. I started to guess when she appeared in scenes without Jackson, an extra or three was going to encounter the business end of Gazelle's ""shoes"".Underneath Valentine's seemingly innocent philanthropy in which he offers free internet and cell phone service through his network is a calculated plan to eradicate global warming. Trouble is, the plan involves causing people to engage in Godzilla-like violent behavior. He also implants computer chips into peoples' necks in which they become mindless minions in service to Valentine. Eventually, we see a demonstration of Valentine's plot in action when he decides to off the congregation of a church of far-right congregants in Kentucky who make Mussolini and Stalin look pretty democratic. The violence in the church was so over-the-top and grotesque, I found I was not enjoying it and wanted to fast-forward out of the scene.While I definitely liked the youth's introduction to Kingsman through Galahad, and I thought Jackson made a good baddie, the endless references to Bond-like cinema I thought was overkill. Not only are Bond films and ""Trading Places"" referenced, but there's parallel's with ""2012"" and there's even an indirect wink to the film ""Pulp Fiction"", which also starred Jackson. Also, the combat scenes were gratuitously violent for no apparent reason. This film is billed as an action-comedy, but I didn't find myself laughing when people's limbs were chopped off. When either Galahad or Gazelle rip into their victims, they literally come apart at the seams.By the end of ""Kingsman"", I wasn't sure what I had seen. Was this a comedy? Kind of. A spoof? Maybe. An homage to action cinema a la the 1960's variety? I guess so. At one point Jackson and Firth talk about those films from their youth, and Jackson even says ""It's not that kind of a movie"". And I think I had to agree. I wasn't sure what kind of movie this was in the first place, and I was still confused by the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Manners Maketh Man,"To me, this is undoubtedly one of the greatest action movies of all time and definitely in the conversation for being one of the best films of the year.Kingsman: The Secret Service is a very fun movie that I can watch at anytime, there's hardly a dull moment and tells a great story of a Kingsman trying to pay the debt of a man who sacrificed himself for his allies. This film also holds one of the greatest action scenes in cinematic history with the infamous ""Church Scene"".I thought all actors were great and played their role perfectly especially Samuel Jackson.

"Nothing more than fun, thrilling, and entertaining","This film, while it may have its flaws, is a great movie worth watching for thrill and excitement. To begin with its flaws, the movie at times seems a bit choppy and some scenes seem as if they're just placed chronologically for the single purpose of exposition and expanding on the plot. In addition, a few key characters aren't developed as well as I think that they could have been. One final flaw is in a few scenes, it was slightly noticeable that green screen technology had been used, since you'd be able to notice how the background and the characters aren't quite in the same shot. But that's it for the biggest flaws.As for its pros, the movie as I mentioned is extremely enjoyable with exciting and well-choreographed action scenes as well several instances of funny moments and lines. For the type of film that Kingsman is, its flaws don't take away much from the movie itself, since it is made solely for enjoyment and excitement and not for a perfect script and a completely original story. It's a entertaining film and strongly recommended for anyone just looking to watch something simple and fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Joyously entertaining - and clearly the first in a franchise,"If you enjoyed the 2010 movie ""Kick-Ass"" (and I certainly did), you'll be joyously entertained by ""Kingsman"". That's no accident since the films have the same British director Matthew Vaughan and the same British writer Jane Goldman (aka Mrs Jonathan Ross). Whereas ""King-Ass"" was a twist on the super-hero genre, ""Kingsman"" is a homage to the spy caper with particular reference to the earlier Bond movies. While ""King-Ass"" was wonderfully violent, ""Kingsman"" at times presents a gore-fest, notably in over the top sequences involving a fight scene in a church and heads exploding to accompanying music.It is a cleverly constructed work with excitement from the opening seconds, a narrative that fairly zips along, and lots of wry humour. And it deliberately pitches for a wide audience with a host of older familiar stars (Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Samuel L Jackson) plus a raft of new younger talent (Taron Egerton as the working class young buck, Sophie Cookson as his side kick, and Sofia Boutella as his intended nemesis). Sometimes it is all a little too contrived, with the device of a line of dialogue repeated later in a slightly different context used over and over again, but it is all so much fun you forgive such contrivances.The plan is that ""Kingsman"" will become a franchise and early in the credits a scene sets up the central character for the next movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Michael Caine does a good job as the 'M' character, its just the hero of the film who doesn't fit with the rest of the cast.There is a lot of product placement and it isn't difficult to see who sponsored the film.This film is OK, but it isn't great. 6 out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

As Unique As A Spoof Movie Could Be,"I love Spy movies like James Bond, Jason Bourne and Mission Impossible. But those franchises while still amazing don't always manage to retain some of their more sillier aspects that made them so unique but Kingsman The Secret Service is able to be a modern spy/action film that feels like it could be a 1960s spy flick and was on elf my favourite movie of 2015. The cast is the movie ranges from unknowns to veterans but they all bring something to this movie, Taron Edgarton was the perfect lead for this movie not only is he really funny and entertaining but he had a great arc to him that made you love and sympathise with him and made excellent chemistry with Colin Firth who was also Fanta in this movie I loved seeing him to something different, an action heavy and suave spy and he really stole this movie for me. The action sequences are so good in this movie Matthew Vaughn did a really great job at directing this movie, you feel every punch and bullet in every fight scene and the church massacre is without out a doubt this films greatest action set piece. The villains in this movie were really entertaining and perfectly balanced of the Spy leads. Samuel L Jackson was so great in this movie I loved his lisp it made him seem more vulnerable and is again a reference to 1960s spy flicks. But by far a more on the nose reference was his female assistant Gazelle I loved her. The sword legs were a really nice touch that made her all the more bad ass. The training sequence of this film is a great way to set up this world of the Kingsman, I loved seeing Eggsy over come obstacles and put up with the spoilt rich kids. I really liked the character of Roxy in this film I thought she had really good chemistry with Eggsy and I really hope that they'll explore their relationship more in the upcoming sequel. The overall plan that Samuel L Jacksons character has is completely far fetched but works for this films more comical and silly tone and made for an excellent final battle.Kingsman The Secret Service perfectly blended modern aspects and older throw backs and was great way to kick of a potentially great new action franchise.94%/A",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Fun, especially for Anglophiles. Villain a bit weak, though.","This movie was fun! If you are at least partly Anglophile then there is a lot in this movie that you will enjoy. If you also like over the top action sequences, then you're sure in for a ride! The movie prefers style to realism, and gags to deep thoughts - which I do not mind at all. It is also meta in many ways, a celebration of the genres that inspired it.The main flaw in this movie is the villain. In the movie they refer to the Bond-movies only being as good as their villains, and if that was the case with this movie, it wouldn't be that good. Jackson is charming as always, but the character itself is not that interesting. Luckily, the heroes are more than enough to keep you entertained, and the grand plot really does not matter that much.And wow, Colin Firth really shows a new side of himself in this movie! Another thing: I am a bit uncertain about how the movie tries to convey an anti-elitist message. The main character is not born into luxury, but was it not for his father then he would not end up in the position he ends up in. And he does not seem to mind the privileges his newfound occupation gives him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Samuel L. Jackson was robbed....,"Few movies had me on the edge of my seat (and still does) like this one has.

His maniacal portrayal as an over the top eco-warrior was nothing short of brillant and stole the show. HE SHOULD HAVE WON THE OSCAR FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR!Finally learning that the organization has been compromised Merlin and the ""new"" Lancelot place their trust in Eggsy to help save the day.

Quite the contrary, a big part of this is spoofing on old spy flicks.Performances are all spot on, even Jackson's ridiculous lisp feels like it somehow fits in this crazy world.

Very Entertaining Movie.,"Over the years I have seen many spy-thrillers. The more obvious being the James Bond films based upon the Ian Fleming novels. Each James Bond film has a unique maniacal villain with world domination as his main agenda.This film is no different. Here we have internet billionaire Richmond Valentine(Samuel L. Jackson) who leads a paranoid and selfish existence. He believes the world is doomed by global warming - and the only solution is a worldwide cull. And so, he sets about his plans in gusto.Then we have hero of the film, young Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin(Taron Egerton) who leads a sad existence in the ghetto. The death of his father gives him an opportunity to join Kingsman, a secret intelligence agency that fights against terrorist threats.In the film we have the typical gadgets or gizmo's that your average agent needs. We also have the kill sequences similar to the Bond movies, however with updated C.G.I. effects in all their glory. The main factor that makes the film work is that the script is well polished, the action and acting is thoroughly controlled, the cinematography and sound-effects are superb.Some actors shine more than others, here we have Samuel Jackson and Colin Firth as one of the best. Mark Hamill has a small cameo as Professor James Arnold. I hardly recognized him at all. Just by looking at the end credits did I realize that he was in the film. Taron David Egerton makes a good leap from TV into mainstream Hollywood.Matthew Vaughan has made some good films in the past like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000) and directing the films Layer Cake (2004), Stardust (2007), Kick-Ass (2010), X-Men: First Class (2011). He has some similarity in style with other directors like Chris Nolan and Paul W.S. Anderson.Verdict: definitely a good way to pass one and a half hours. But I wouldn't watch the film again. Typical toilet paper film.You may also like: The 39 Steps 1959, North By NorthWest 1959, Torn Curtain 1966, The Ipcress File 1965, The Odessa File 1974, Firefox (1982), The Fourth Protocol 1987, The Bourne Identity 1988, The Russia House (1990), If Looks Could Kill (released in the UK as Teen Agent) 1991, Mission Impossible 1996.Thank you for reading this review.

Action Adventure Spy Movie to the Next Level,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is the next awesome spy movie that is very alike to the James Bond movies, but in a action/comedy humor way.

Honestly,Taron Egerton did an outstanding job portraying his character Eggsy Unwin (who is a teenage boy from the streets to the agency of Kingsman) and he learns the way of Kingsman from his mentor Harry Hart (Colin Firth). Eggsy and Harry come along very well in this movie. As well as seeing Samuel L. Jackson portray as a bad guy which his name is Valentine, I was in wow by how well Samuel L.

The characters are build to make you feel in the team and at the same time keeps the individuality of each one of them, making them unique in some way.To me Kingsman was born from the desire of creating a modern age Bond with a different english accent, a different tone. Still, this movie doesn't shine because of its plot, or a excentric villain, known for a long time now, but because the action scenes actually makes you get up the chair and enjoy what you see. It's not written as a remarkable novel but a well engineered way to watch and feel action and tension. It doesn't need more, but of course I would apreciate a good written and a new-look to this genre.I would totally recommend it, as one of my favorite spy genre movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The fact that there are over 100 uses of the f-word take it out of the teenage crowd acceptability.,"""The suit is the modern gentleman's armor. The Kingsmen are the new knights.""

Before I really looked at the rating for this I was expecting a teenage Cody Banks type movie. After seeing it was rated R I was confused. The movie is very much geared toward the teenage crowd, but the fact that there are over 100 uses of the f-word take it out of the teenage crowd acceptability. The fact that the movie is about a younger agent takes this out of the older crowd's desire to see this. Colin Firth is very good and this is a different part for him. The main problem is that the swearing and violence push it out watch-ability for the crowd it is intended for. Had the movie been the same without the swearing it would have found an audience. As it stands its in between those that can't see it and those that don't want to. Overall, adding the unnecessary swearing really hurt the movie badly.

A woman's head is accidentally crushed by a fleeing party goer, with blood briefly shown spurting. Another person is impaled by a lamp-post, with massive amounts of blood spurting from his chest as he expresses bewilderment. Very graphic and gory. ""Or , Seven Psychopaths,Violence & Gore 8/10 , ""A man drags a straight razor across his throat and we see the slit open and blood gushing from the wound.""And that should be labeled as comedy ?

Manners maketh man.,"This is an enjoyable spy movie similar to the James Bond movies with a more light hearted tone. It has a core problem of having the main villain seek to destroy the world, which makes the ending quite predictable. However the most grievous error was the misuse of the amazing actors Mark Hamill and Michael Caine, which were in smaller roles that didn't take advantage of their unique strengths. In short it's enjoyable, however has a fundamental flaw in the predictability of the story and misuse of actors.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Well done,"The Secret Service is a 2014 spy action comedy film directed by Matthew Vaughn. It is the first installment in the Kingsman film series and is also based on the comic book series of the same name, written by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons, published by Millarworld and based on concept by Millar and Vaughn. The film follows Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin's (Taron Egerton) recruitment by Harry Hart (Colin Firth) into Kingsman, a secret spy organisation. Eggsy joins a mission, in brutal and comedic fashion, to tackle a global threat from Richmond Valentine (Samuel L.

This film doesn't know what it wants to be.,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is like two films, really. It starts out the neoclassic, early-Bondesque, spy-thriller-meets-Hunger-Games mash-up the trailers make it out to be. The plot and characters are compelling enough that you want to hang in, suspend disbelief and see where this is going. But it hits a wall in the last 30 minutes or so; from the conclusion of the church scene on, it's Austin-Powers-meets-Jackass-meets-Spring-Breakers-Gone-Wild. Screenplay, direction, production values all tank; it's like Vaughn got pulled off to another project and left the sum-up to his high-school interns ... or the guys at his car wash. And the camp factor comes too late and too abruptly to pull this into ""cult"" territory. The Vaughn fanboys will disagree, of course, and there are plenty on these boards. This movie suits the adolescent boy-fantasy mindset; if your standards are at all higher, you'll be disappointed. Pity, really. If I'd walked out after the first hour, this could've been a good 7-8 film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Fooling with etiquette,"I'm not attracted to anything in particular here and insofar as it moves fast it passes by without much incident, unless you're the type of viewer who in a silly film such as this likes to take umbrage by things like a pretty girl rewarding the world-saving hero with her body.But that - a princess swooning over her savior knight and yet the scene promises quick sex on a couch and not romance - is part of the deliberate crudeness here, usually noted as irony and amounting to a simple fooling with some etiquette. Here the James Bond film but the supervillain is a lisping nerd, the suave spy maims and kills hundreds in a scene of frenzy etc.It's such a small difference that I find no subversion in it and indeed quite the opposite, simple convention. This is a British attempt at a superhero comic book using the American language of spectacle to push out British stereotyped traditions in narrative.So an opening scene of meddling in the Middle east only serves as generic stage to exalt British heroism. A super-secret society of gentlemen spies exists to steer the world into order, above MI6 - which as Brits know has merely been a junior partner of the CIA for decades, though we're not told in the film - and founded back in prewar days, that is in better days when Brits were still dominant. The established order is compromised and gentlemanly resourcefulness shines through it.I'm not saying this from the viewpoint that it's harmful politics, it's fluff we will leave behind in no time, and only noting what gives rise to the image. Injecting adolescence in the tour and leaving the places visited the same. A Brit saves the world much like in James Bond fantasies - only he's a kid.(There's an aerial scene here as the kids parachute from a plane, I collect aerial scenes of this sort because they reveal with some purity the aerodynamics of visual imagination in its flight, the gravity of a falling body in space, the currents of that space, the turbulence of camera paths. This one just pales by comparison to work being done on the American side; some exciting work can be seen in Jupiter Ascending).",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Lowbrow, crass, sophomoric, yet still entertaining..","Just got back from the theater seeing this movie. Over all it was pretty entertaining, yet kind of let down too. I really wished I chose the other one that had Liam Neeson in it.It started out pretty well, but like most movies these days they feel they have to push it over the top.I think they were going for some kind of humorous feel, a bit of a spoof at parts, but it ended up feeling kind dirty and tasteless. It felt like instead of making a more quality story they went for the cheap thrills with a lot of four letter words, violence, and needless sexual overtones.In one particular scene it was non-stop over the top violent. I don't know what they were going for but everyone in the theater seemed to get tense. We were all wondering what the hell we just saw. Was this supposed to be funny or dramatic?And in the James Bond films (which this movie tries to spoof at points) the sex scenes are sort of implied, good enough, but this one became weird. Several people, mainly ladies, walked out on the film early.Over all fairly entertaining, but felt kind of cheapened by attempts to make it too edgy and contemporary..",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best action movie of all time,"Seeing as if most of the action movies do not depict violence as detailed as it can be, Kingsman stands out from all the others due to its outstadingly made fighting and shooting scenes, which by the way do not show much blood (sometimes a lot of gore).

"Uneven at times, but it shows a lot of potential for a future franchise","""There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.""Kingsman is director Matthew Vaughn's fifth feature film and there was a lot of speculation over this movie considering he had chosen to direct this over the sequel to his highly successful X-Men First Class. He was also in talks to direct the new Star Wars franchise, but Vaughn wanted to adapt Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons' comic book ""The Secret Service"" instead. A comic book I had never heard of, but Vaughn's dedication to the material is inspired by his love for the old James Bond films, and this adaptation plays out as a love letter to those former movies with fascinating villains and a far fetched plot. Kingsman is rich in style and the film is beautifully directed by Vaughn who has always proved his abilities behind the camera. His 2004 debut, Layer Cake, starring Daniel Craig might actually be the reason why he has now become the new James Bond. Vaughn, who had produced some of Guy Ritchie's films, was heavily influenced by him in that first film, but he has established himself now with his own personal style. My favorite film from Vaughn is still Kick-Ass which felt fresh when it first came out and established itself as a refreshing parody of super hero films. My expectations for Kingsman grew when I heard that this comic book adaptation was written by the same person who wrote the Kick-Ass comic because I was a huge fan of that film. However, the idea didn't feel as fresh this time and I had some issues with a couple of violent scenes that took me out of the movie. Kingsman does do to spy movies what Kick-Ass did to super hero movies, but if you saw that film you could expect some of the dark turns and twists that were going to come here. It is very similar in style and some of the characters go through the same fate but it is still fun and entertaining.Kingsman centers on a British spy organization run by Arthur (Michael Caine) that is trying to stop a global threat from a billionaire tech innovator named Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). When one of the spies dies during a mission, the agency decides to recruit a new one. Each one of the spies chooses a young candidate and Harry Hart (Colin Firth) puts his eyes on a street kid named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who shows a lot of promise. The recruits have to go through an intense program under the guidance of their instructor Merlin (Mark Strong). Meanwhile Harry continues to investigate Valentine and try to discover what he is up to as several celebrities and government officials begin to disappear.The film felt bipolar at times. There are incredibly fun action sequences that are directed very well by Vaughn, but at the same time there are some disturbing violent scenes that take place in a church. The violence is cartoonish, but there are instances where it does feel out of place. I don't know why some of those scenes took me out of the movie because Vaughn is just having fun with the action scenes, but they just felt out of place. The things that did work best for me in Kingsman are the strong performances from Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Firth who play off each other extremely well. The scenes they share together are wonderful and their self referential movie talk is hilarious. Valentine has a lisp which reminds us of some of the physical dysfunctions that the early villains from the Bond franchise had. Vaughn introduces small elements like this as he pays homage to some of those entertaining films. Newcomer, Taron Egerton, also delivers the good as this young street smart kid who is learning the ways of becoming a gentlemen. His scenes with Firth are another highlight of the film. Perhaps the most entertaining thing about Kingsman is the recruiting process the kids have to go through. One of the other potential candidates is Roxy who is played very well by Sophie Cookson. She shares excellent chemistry with Egerton. Mark Strong might be my favorite character in this film and he also gets plenty of screen time. Sofia Boutella also delivers a memorable role as one of Valentine's sidekicks. Kingsman is highly entertaining and has many positive things going for it, but there are a couple of disturbing scenes that felt out of place. Despite this, Vaughn is still five for five and a director I will continue to look forward to.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Fun, brutal, intellectual and streetwise","""Kingsman"" is a solid action film which twists the tropes of its own spy movie genre in intellectual, sardonic and also gut-busting, kick-in-the-teeth ways. Samuel L Jackson is the perfect choice for the delivery of this unique blend. He manages to hold together a mess of megalomaniac contradictions: both immensely inhibited and freewheeling, he subverts our expectations at nearly every turn.I like the film, but find something of the method of the Kingsman training deplorable even if eventually explained. However I accept the harshness was meant to instill a sense of life without ""safety nets,"" and to touch a nerve of the real behind the simulation, much like the film's confrontation of the play acting of movie tropes versus how conflict really plays out ""in the streets,"" so to speak.Finely done!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

It's got suave heroes, unbelievable stunt-laden action, natty high-tech gadgets, a megalomaniacal villain with a cool mountain-top lair, a deadly henchwoman with an unusual pair of weapons, and oodles of extreme violence, all delivered at a cracking pace with stunning visual effects by Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn.

"Kingsman: Spies, Villains, and Rock and Roll","Matthew Vaughn wants you to know that the spy movies today are too serious. They are too dark, too long, and too exhausting. He fancies a time back when spy films had a sense of humor, took chances, and were over the top because, in his eyes, that made them something he feels these films were born to be....fun. It's hard not to agree with him. Some of my fondest memories watching the old Bond films of Connery and Moore were how over the top they were. The cheesy villains, gadgets, and one liners. They made you roll your eyes but you didn't care because you were enjoying the hell out of the movie. Now in in my opinion, the darkness of recent spy films, especially in the Bond franchise, has greatly improved the genre. While the old spy films are fun, they became almost too ridiculous and repetitive to the point where they were just bad movies. Kingsman: The Secret Service is Vaughn's homage to the old spy film. Reminding Hollywood to try to have a little fun once in awhile.The story really is pretty formulaic throughout the first half. You have a mission from the past where something goes wrong and an agent goes down and that agent just happens to be the father of who will be our hero Gary....excuse me, I mean ""Eggsy"" (Yeah...I don't get it either) played competently by up and comer Taron Edgerton. Years pass and Eggsy has become the young lost soul who can't see to find a place in the world while trying to protect his mother and baby sister from an abusive stepfather blah blah blah. But again, much like those old spy films, you aren't seeing this film for the story.The film really gets rolling once we get more familiar with Harry Hart, Eggsy's mentor and certified bad ass in one of the very best performances of the early year by Colin Firth. When you think of the casting going into the film, Harry is the most crucial. He is used to embody that old school spy who is one part bad ass and one part distinguished English gentleman. Firth is an English gentleman by nature but the risk of casting him in the role is he is just about the least bad ass type actor you and even HE can think of. You'll read this same thought in any other review of the film but that point really can't be overstated. Any director worth anything can make someone look like they can kick ass with effects and such (cough...cough...Tobey Maguire), but if the actor isn't believable throughout the rest of the film as a force to be reckoned with, then the film suffers. Firth talks the talk of the gentleman and kicks ass as the spy. He is smooth, funny, and blows up the film with his swagger. A performance not to be forgotten any time soon.The rest of the casting is fitting. Samuel L. Jackson was the ideal choice to play an over the top villain because....well....what hasn't he been in his career if not over the top? Probably my favorite thing about his Valentine character is that I was originally going to write about how it was a little difficult at times to understand what some of the British actors are saying due to their thick accents. Vaughn gives a wink to the audience (especially the American audience) by giving the American Valentine a lisp that makes him sounds ridiculous AND gives him a line calling out the issue Americans have with Brit actors ""You Brits...Y'all talk so funny"". Well played Vaughn. We also get some solid supporting performances from Mark Strong and Michael Caine (playing a real ass hole in films lately) to round out a solid cast.If you're going into Kingsman: The Secret Service and expecting Skyfall the you're going to be disappointed. Kingsman isn't about being dark and serious with some powerful societal message to go along with it. Kingsman does what Matthew Vaughn intended it to do which was to give you a fun time. It's got violence, comedy, and some great music adding up to a great time at the movies. So turn your brain off for a bit, enjoy the chaos and don't bother trying to hide the smile you'll have when you walk out of the theater....we all saw it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fans of Vaughn and Miller won't be disappointed!,"'KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Matthew Vaughn directs yet another action comic book movie (following 'KICK-ASS' and 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS'), which is again adapted from material written by Mark Millar (the creator of the 'Kick-Ass' comics; as well as other popular titles like 'Wanted', 'Civil War' and 'The Ultimates'). It was written by Vaughn and his usual writing partner Jane Goldman. It stars Colin Firth as a highly skilled secret agent who recruits a street-smart young man into an elite secret agency force. They must do battle with a brilliant billionaire eco-terrorist, played by Samuel L. Jackson. The movie also costars Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Sophie Cookson, Sofia Boutella, Mark Hamill, Jack Davenport and Michael Caine. Fans of Vaughn and Miller won't be disappointed.The Kingsmen are a special spy organization, in London, that recently lost one of their best agents. They begin a very tough, and highly competitive, recruitment process; to find his replacement. Agent Galahad (Firth) decides to give a young street-smart criminal a chance, named Eggsy (Egerton). Eggsy is the son of an old Kingsmen agent, who was killed on an assignment, with Galahad, in the Middle East; 17 years earlier. Galahad made a promise to help out the deceased agent's family. The agency is also preparing for a dangerous mission; to do battle with a rich tech genius, named Valentine (Jackson), who's threatening to kill millions in an insane population control plan.The movie is everything I expected it to be; it's full of witty characters, spouting off clever dialogue, in cool and very stylistic action scenes. It's also got a lot of excessive, and very over-the- top, violence and it's even more gory than Vaughn's, and Miller's, own ultra-violent 'KICK-ASS' films (I'd say). Firth is great in the movie and it's also a pretty funny British spy spoof too. The only real flaw (I can see), in the film, is that the main young hero isn't that likable; sure he's relatable, and a believable British punk, but he doesn't have a heck of a lot of character or charm. Firth make's up for what Egerton's character is lacking though and it's still a pretty awesome action flick; as a whole. I'm sure it'll become another beloved cult classic, for Matthew Vaughn and Mark Miller lovers!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/yW1G90SYF_o",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"While not as good as critics would have you believe, it's still the best film of 2015 thus far","I saw two films in two days here, yesterday I saw Chappie which I was told I would hate and actually kinda liked, and today I saw Kingsman, which I was told I would LOVE and actually only kinda liked. As much as I try not to have any expectations going in, there's only so much you can do to avoid that. And because its hard to get a gauge on your outside influences, it can be hard to know just how much not loving a movie was because you had it over-hyped, and how much is because its just not your thing. I had the same problem with Gone Girl, and, like Gone Girl, I'm gonna assume it was predominantly the former and not the latter, and bump it up from three starts to three and a half by the skin of its teeth. Now you may have noticed that I said I ""didn't love"" it rather than ""it was garbage"". That's because I liked it, I really liked it and there is a lot you'll carry out from Kingsman that you'll hold on to for a long time. Matthew Vaughn is an absolute goddamn MASTER filmmaker, Colin Firth, Mark Hammil, Sam Jackson, Michael Caine, Mark Strong and Geoff Bell all get to flex their acting muscles here, and that is never gonna fail to get me stoked. You may not have heard of Taron Egerton or Sofie Boutella before, but mar my words, after their performances in this, you're gonna start hearing about them a lot, real damn soon. I'm calling it now, unless they somehow start making some monumentally poor decisions, household names by 2018. I did like Kingsman, and I feel obliged to tell you it earned the right to hold onto the top five box office for over a month, and its appeal is, while not universal, still broad. It may well be the best film of 2015 thus far, but it's also not so glamorous as most would have you believe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Stylish, Strong, Superb Spy Cinema.","Kingsman: The Secret Service is a film that is far better than it has any right to be. What could of been a by-the-numbers parody of the recent Mission: Impossible, Bourne trilogy and Daniel Craig Bond flicks, though each of those respective franchises are great in their own right, is in fact something truly special.Kingsman gave me the same feeling as last year's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' unpretentious, well directed and fun yet clever. Kingsman works on a number of different levels that make it a joy to behold. For one, it's an intriguing premise. A young boy living on a council estate in London is recruited to join a secret intelligence service working to preserve peace and order in the world and from there, must face a deadly megalomaniac who is intent on bringing about a new world order.For one, Kingsman is flawless in it's acting, Taron Egerton is sure for high heights, Colin Firth embodies the brilliance of Roger Moore's Bond but gives a far more lethal edge. While Mark Strong, Samuel L Jackson and Micheal Caine all shine in each of their respective roles.The film is also incredibly slick, the design on the film from the fact all of the Kingsman wear suits to the nostalgia fantastical plot is all a homage of sorts and yet Kingsman is profoundly original in a sense, it blends humour with a plot that is intelligently self aware all the while will still make you actually care for the characters and has enough curve-balls to make this seemingly predictable romp be far smarter than you were expecting.The music is great, a fight scene to 'give it up' by KC and the Sunshine band was a highlight for me and while the CGI isn't the big Hollywood Blockbuster standard, it still has that visceral punch to it that makes it a beautifully aesthetic and 70s feel to it.Whilst it's violence, though shockingly brutal is just stunning. Never before have I seen an action scene that is so well shot and paced and disturbingly amazing! If you have seen the film, I am sure you know what I'm talking about.It's a controversial film, that wears it proudly on it's sleeve, it's not afraid to offend and is something that many films lack the bravado to do so. It is also incredibly funny, with some great lines and still has some heart and emotion at it's center with a fantastically British flair.Kingsman is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, whilst Award season is currently progressing, with films that only possess depth or tackle big themes and overly convoluted, complex characters only being nominated. It's so refreshing that a film that is at it's core: fun whilst still being great is finally bursting into Cinemas. This is one of the rare films that I do hope is successful in order to warrant a sequel, if not, then it'll be a shame but what Matthew Vaughn and his creative team have done, is made a film that I will watch again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Better than i was expecting,"Having seen the trailer and read a couple of reviews for Kingsman: The Secret Service i wasn't expecting too much from this film but i actually thought it was a lot of fun. Sure , it has quite a few faults ( which film doesn't ? ) and it's extremely silly but the action is very good and at no stage was i bored. It's a cross between Spy Kids , James Bond and Austin Powers and it's strange to see Colin Firth involved in something so left of field but he does a pretty good job. The language is pretty raw through out so it's not something the kids or granny should watch , which is a shame because apart from that and the violence it's a very childish film.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A spy action movie for a new generation,"29 January 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Kingsman: The Secret Service. This film looked good right from the very first trailer. Very much a James Bond parody but up to date and obviously much younger, the character of Eggsy portrayed in this film is recruited, by a senior Kingsman Agent (Colin Firth) to take the place of a recently deceased colleague. Along with a whole group of other trainee agent Eggsy must battle to prove his worth and become the newest agent. With Samuel L Jackson playing the maniacal baddie, we see a standard good guy, bad guy action movie with quite a few laughs thrown in for good measure. There are some excellent fight scenes and a splendid musical spectacular which completely stole the show. It's refreshing to see a good well written plot combining new gags, up to date technology, reference to established genres and not forgetting Colin Firth in a most splendid British stiff upper lip action role. I hope this is the first of a series of these films. Highly recommended viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Stylish, slick and immense fun","In a time when celebrities mysteriously started to disappear and environmental damage caused by human overpopulation became the top agenda for a tech tycoon, a small gentlemen's tailor shop in London stood as the last defender against rising evil. For decades, the Kingsman secret service operated as an independent international intelligence agency in the guise of the tailor shop. Its meticulously dressed agent Galahad proudly defines the agency to a recruit, ""The suit is a modern gentleman's armour. And the Kingsman agents are the new knights"". Matthew Vaughn ('Kick-Ass', 'X-Men: First Class') provides the campy seriousness of a James Bond villain's threat but also has slick, bloody action that shocks they way 'Kick-Ass' did. This spy thriller is a patiche of several franchises but with Vaughn's bold, ruthless and stylized action sequences, it creates a genre on its own. The more ridiculous it gets, the more fun it is.Having the guilt of losing an agent during an unfortunate mission, Harry Hart (Colin Firth) aka Galahad offers aid to his family. Years later, the son Eggsy (Taron Egerton) grows up in the East end with a middle class upbringing and when his immature acts led to his arrest, he used his wild card and contacted the Kingsman. Harry bails him from prison and offers to recruit him as an agent. Any doubt in Eggsy's mind is laid to rest when he witnesses Harry taking down some rogues in a fast reflexive, stylishly canny brawl at a pub. The recruitment for the one agent who will become a Kingsman will see six youngsters in Hunger Games or X-Men type tests to determine their worthiness. From a flood in their dorm room, to keeping a dog constantly by their side and to dive from the skies to land on target while avoiding radars. Meanwhile, Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), the lisping tech tycoon who dresses up like a rap artist is the opposite of the suave secret agents. His evil plan for saving the planet from degradation is to cull the population of the dominant virus. With an app that triggers a micro SIM card installed in each subscriber, he can force aggressive behaviors in humans anywhere on the planet with the help of a satellite. The Kingsman must attack his stronghold and disengage him and also destroy the satellite that would transmit global ruin.The action is stupendous in parts. The pub brawl is only an introduction to Vaughn's style of slick, fast paced action but it is the precursor to the final mission, that is Harry's solo rage war in a church that stands out as one of the most brilliantly choreographed action sequences in recent memory. This one can be more astounding than what was witnessed in Kick-Ass. Throughout the movie, Vaughn pushes the clichés to new, darker levels that are crazily entertaining. ""This ain't that kind of a movie"".Algerian babe Sofia Boutella is the stunning steel prosthetic leg bearing human cleaver who dances her way through some shocking action scenes. As Gazelle, she is a threatening supporting villain who aids Valentine by doing all the dirty work. Samuel L. Jackson is a wickedly cool villain. After playing Nick Fury for so long, it is great to see him in a role where he can really open up and be at his expressive best. Michael Caine also gets to step out of his norm of being the gentle elder in the story and his stubbornness as the head of the Kingsman instigates suspicion and despise at the same time. Quite an unusual way to feel about Alfred. Mark Strong is excellent as Merlin, the resourceful Kingsman agent who sees the recruits through their testing stages and plays a critical role in the climax. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as Prof. Arnold who witnesses the bold rescue attempt in the beginning of the movie by an unlucky Kingsman agent. Taron Egerton is impressive. He plays an East-ender with the same natural ability as he plays a Kingsman with a suit on. Among his best scenes is certainly the one where he hesitates while pointing a gun at his pup 'JB'. Egerton remarkably holds his act well in the midst of such powerful actors. If Daniel Craig can be the hard faced serious agent, Egerton will be the earnestly entertaining one who can still kick-ass.Colin Firth is a veteran of a different genre of films. Therefore, to see him play such a lead role in a movie that mocks a spy genre and involves action that makes even 'Kick-Ass' look amateurish, is just difficult to grasp. Yet, he does so with such ease and finesse. The double-breasted suit was just tailored to perfection for him and he pretty much defines what a Kingsman agent is all about. Kind in his words, gentle in his behaviour but occasionally, needs to let off some steam in a crazy manner. He delivers an equally serious performance as he did in 'The King's Speech' in a movie that is overall just funny and crazy. That, precisely, is his strength as an actor.Michael Vaughn drew inspiration from Mark Millar's comic book series titled 'The secret service' but quickly altered many aspects of it to add his story-telling style that occasionally goes from stylish to outlandish but it never stops being immense fun. Vaughn pays tribute to the entertaining spy genre but uncannily, forms an alternate one where slicing victims with prosthetic leg blades, exploding heads and stylish gadgets will be common dealings for the Gentlemen who will save the day. Even James Bond would smirk at this job offer.9.15 on a scale of 1-10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Mission Accomplished!,"Comic book films have become a genre in themselves over the last decade. The well-known characters – Batman, Spiderman, Xmen, Avengers etc have been consistently successful which has led Hollywood executives to plunder the more obscure titles in search of the next big thing. Kingsman: The Secret Service is one such title based on the graphic novel, The Secret Service by legendary writer Frank Miller but the difference is this is not a film to take the kids to. But don't let that put you off, it's one of the most enjoyable and over the top experiences you'll see at the movies all year.Kingsman kicks off in 1997 somewhere in the Middle East. Secret agents, AKA The Kingsman led by Harry (Colin Firth) are on a mission to extract information from a prisoner who duly blows himself up, killing one of their agents. It's Harry's duty to break the news to his widow and in turn meets young Egsy (played by newcomer Taron Egerton). Years later The Kingsman are looking for another recruit and Egsy (now grown up and in the midst of a local gang war) comes to Harry's attention.The next hour of the film is a cross between The Apprentice and Full Metal Jacket as the potential recruits are tested in life or death situations and whittled down to find the best of the best. In the meantime we are introduced to token megalomaniac billionaire villain Valentine (Samuel L Jackson) who is making it his mission to sell his ""product"" to all the world leaders in an attempt to save the Earth from extinction – of course nothing is ever as it seems and it's only a matter of time before the Doomsday clock starts ticking.It's here that the film starts to have fun. The casting of Colin Firth is a genius move – always known as a gentle type of dramatic actor in his first action role, Firth is let fully off the leash and must've spent months in training for the two brilliantly filmed, and extremely violent fight scenes that are as good as anything similar you've seen on screen before. Taron Egerton – plucked from relative TV obscurity – does a fine job and this will no doubt be the start of a new career for him. Samuel L Jackson is good value and can play this role in his sleep and his henchwoman, Gazelle is straight from the Comics and slices up opponents with her blades that double as legs.The director Matthew Vaughn (director of Kick Ass – the copied style of funny, ultra violence here is clear as crystal) is also on great form and handles the action superbly - clearly setting the tone to be an enjoyable ride whilst frequently referencing the old school James Bond films before he went all serious – gadgets, guns and girls are the order of the day. All in all, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a cracking piece of OTT cinematic excitement – Mission Accomplished!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I am disappointed,"I saw this film last night thinking that it could be a little serious. I am disappointed having wasted my time with a shabby parody of James Bond films. Of course a parody is well come, when it is a real one, with humor and not a bunch of rubbish, like this. What a pity for actors like Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Caine to be let in such a nonsense.My vote 3/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Very entertaining,"I do think some reviewers get carried away when they like a movie. Some movies deserve 8 to 10/10 but this isn't one of them even though I had a riot watching it.The comic book style suited this movie. The comedy is good....even from Mr. Stiff Colin Firth. I really enjoyed watching him try his hand at a silly role for once.This movie definitely has a Kick-Ass vibe. It's very violent but not gory in the slightest.This movie won't be for everyone so if you see my review and didn't like films such as Kick-Ass, then stay away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Couldn't make it any better,"One might argue about the plot or the genre here but given this was set by someone I have virtually no idea how anyone could have made this movie in any better way. It is at least as good and entertaining as any of the good old James Bond films not only containing violent action (as some of the new ones do). It contains nice and lovable characters with some development (you can't expect too much here of course), a great villain and a good share of funny entertainment and some surprises one would not have necessarily pre-anticipated. If you like something like ""Red"" or as mentioned above the old James Bond style to first have some drink after waking up from being anaesthetised that is one to go for. (would have rated this 9.5 put since I can only pick integers: it's a ten)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"High-octane, violent, and decidedly over-the-top in its roots, Kingsman is a clever spy action spoof blooming with witty humor and style","This spy action comedy sees English director Matthew Vaughn taking the classic James Bonds films and spinning them into a sweet, yet audacious comedic spoof. Following his success with 2010's 'Kick- Ass', which showcased a tongue-in-cheek approach at the superhero genre, Vaughn orchestrates a fast-paced action vehicle that echoes the classic 007 flicks, but with an over-the-top, stylized approach that allows for a reasonable examination of what an R-rated James Bond mixed with raunchy humor would resemble. Although the film proceeds with a mean- spirited streak and experiments with humor in unapologetic territory, Vaughn crafts his concept with wit and cleverness. There is rarely a moment that goes wasted in the final product. And most importantly, the film is fully self-aware of what it is and does not aim to take itself too seriously. That is the beauty of what makes Kingsman a hell of a lot of fun. This film follows Eggsy Unwin (played by Taran Edgerton), a young man in his early twenties, the son of a former British spy who was slain in a mission gone awry. Following his arrest for a petty crime, Eggsy come face-to-face with Harry Hart a.k.a. Galahad (played by Colin Firth) who introduces him to a secret spy organization known as The Kingsman, headed by Chester King (played by Michael Caine). Their goal is recruit spies and train them to defeat an maniacal millionaire tech genius named Richmond Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson). With a mind-controlling chips inserted inside the brains of millions of people around the globe, Valentine's evil plan is lead everyone on Earth to kill each other and start a new world order, and with Gazelle (played by Sofia Boutella), a martial arts woman with prosthetic legs with blades for weapons, on his side. So it is up to Eggsey and the rest of the Kingsman to stop his diabolical, or face an unspeakable global disaster.Matthew Vaughn clearly has his tongue in his cheek when approaching the classic spy genre, with characters spewing references of James Bond sporadically throughout the picture, along with the various action elements owing homages to the British spy of cinema. Does the director's comedic approach work? In many ways, absolutely. The movie follows a plot that is almost never meant to be taken seriously, as opposed to the more darker elements that escalate a few scenes. When the action kicks in, there is plenty of violence and a wild barrage of raunchy dialogue and humor taps at the funny bone, while echoing the bold comedic-style of 'Kick-Ass'. It is hard not to indulge in the fun of Colin Firth beating down the bad guys in a bar, while admiring the slick, stylized execution of the action. In the process, the director always keeps things moving and almost never lets any jokes go to waste. There are a few moments where Vaughn tends to push the envelop with his comedic streak, particularly for the conservative right. Easily the scene that best demonstrates this is one involving a violent massacre at Baptist church filled with a hatred-spewing congregation, apparently paying homage to Westboro Baptist. On the other hand, this film never fails to have a good time while allowing you to turn your brain off. Colin Firth demonstrates a humorous streak with subversive dialogue and raunchy jokes. Mark Strong, playing an ally of the Kingsman gets the job done. Samuel L. Jackson, playing a maniacal villain with the persona resembling Dr. Evil from 'Austin Powers', shines with suitable over-the-topness of a villain with a morbid, yet humorous energy. Then there is Taran Egerton, playing a naive young man going from zero to hero, who evolves with solid charisma.Kingsman: The Secret Service is a high-octane spy action comedy blistering with rewarding comedic energy and fun that is simply irresistible, at least for those who can skim past the questionably bold humor. Matthew Vaughn lives up to his directorial talent, surpassing the over-the-top superhero spectacle that was 'Kick-Ass'. To say the least, this movie is a total blast in the realm of graphic novels.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"I mean it is OK, but nothing extraordinary!","I was surprised to find out that this film was rated 8 out of 10. I would not give it such a high grade, may be 7 out of 10 is more appropriate.The problem being that I saw so many films like this before, spy thrillers/comedies. I have to say this one brings in refreshment as far as the plot goes. It is very well thought out plot with very cool and sexy ending ;) Acting is excellent. I really liked all the actors who participated and they mostly did an excellent job.What I did not like was too many aristocratic sets, with leather chairs, fireplaces etc. Too much out of time and date.

A little disappointed and too overrated,"I had some expectations when I read some reviews but unfortunately I am not completely satisfied. I expected a much more clever story and it delivered two brutal sequences. I don't know why so much blood must flow here. Perhaps you know what I mean. Or am I wrong because I have to understand the British humor? Is this really British humor? Okay, there were some funny jokes but the special effects I didn't like.I prefer rather the Johnny English series with Mister Bean even if there isn't so much woman sex appeal.I will not see the second part if there will ever be a sequel.

I'm 47 and I loved it,"Little bit of Bond, Little bit of Kill Bill, little bit Austin Powers. I've always liked movies where the main character evolves into a bad ass better version of himself. The fighting in this movie is definitely above average violent. John Wick recently..i didn't love the movie, but i did appreciate that the violence and fight scenes were more graphic than usual. The scene in the church in this movie was very reminiscent of the scene in the Japanese restaurant in Kill Bill. Also worth noting....I remember reading that Tarantino had to make that scene black and white to get around the censors because there was ""too much"" blood in that scene. There is a scene towards the end of this movie where some animation was inserted in lieu of horrific graphic violence, which i thought was hilarious. There are also movie lines that stay with you for the rest of your life, ""I am your father"", etc... and this movie has might what go down as the single greatest line in movie history...taken in context..who said it...the situation, the fact that it was out of the blue and seemingly out of character for this person, and the other persons response to it...was just great. If you like Bond, Men in Black, Mission impossible, 24, etc....and you have an above average sense of humor, go see it.

New mile stone in history of action movies,"To be honest I don't really understand how come that the rating of this movie stars with a 7.

I think they managed to come up with an entirely new way of shooting a fight scene which involves having many long takes that are rather rare in fight scenes. And who would have ever thought that ""Darcy"" becomes the new action hero in a movie that beats the ""Mission Impossible"" series.The story itself is good as well, good-written.

Hugely entertaining and loads of fun,"KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is one of those movies that grabs you by the stones and doesn't let go until the credits roll. I haven't seen any of the spy films that it pays homage to, but if they're anything like this I'll get right on it. The basic story is about a young man, Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who joins a super-secret spy organization, helps save the world, and becomes a better person in the process. The entire cast did an incredible job playing their characters. You have seasoned veterans like Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson. And then there is newcomer Taron Egerton, who is a revelation. He has a suave, cool attitude to him that really sold the character he played. Not only were the performances excellent all-round, the actors looked like they were having a great time, which spills over onto the audience as a result. The action sequences, an important part of a film like this, were also really good. Matthew Vaughn has a way with kinetic action (see: LAYER CAKE, KICK-ASS) and he delivers that here. Although the editing and camera-work pushes the boundaries of comprehensibility, the geography of each scene was never in question. The crown jewel of these is a scene in a church set to Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird. If you aren't on-board with the film at this point, maybe it isn't for you. If there's anything that be said negatively about the film, the characterization of the villain might not sit well with some people. There also was quite a lot of CGI enhancement. And, there's one sexual joke/scene towards the end that could come off as crass, but I thought it was consistent with the type of film this was trying to be. Generally speaking, all of the complaints that could be made of the film have (to me, at least) a valid explanation. It's a highly entertaining film with a good story, excellent action, and a great sense of humor. Just sit back and enjoy the ride!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The best 60% I've ever seen,"This movie is definitely not for everyone.

People seem pretty split about it. As for me: I'm in the former category. I freaking loved this movie! I can really enjoy a self-aware campy gore-fest like this. But, if you don't like it, that's fine. I can see why some people would be disappointed. Though, this movie is not at all worthy of 1s and 2s. You aren't going to sound contradictory if you give a 6/10 and say you still didn't like it. I can admit that Big Hero Six was a good movie, but I still didn't like it as much, and that's perfectly fine.So, if you enjoy seeing Colin Firth kicking unfathomable amounts of ass, it's definitely worth seeing.

The Good Old Days,"Undeniably, there is something irresistible about the English. Overdone, some would say, but that which discernibly distinguishes them. Colin Firth, perhaps one of the last active remnants of the aristocratic legacy of the Queen's culture and coterie at least on the silver screen , stars in this delightfully violent and overwhelmingly recreational movie.A deliberate digression from self-importance colours up the whole situational setting . We have out of the box action sequences. Seriously worded quips and one liners laced with characteristic dry humour of the Isles. An undercurrent of persistent comic reliefs both cultural and as well instinctive.The movie is not shrouded in any contradictory , psychologically complex cryptic conceits . The tale is fairly direct and lucidly directed. One can argue that the movie a tad too long but the intensity of the scenes is such, that one does not deem prudent to as much as utter a pretentious sigh of fatigue.Those who do not relish violence may find the movie a little distasteful and gross . The kinship to Kick-Ass can be clearly identified in the thematic treatment of the movie. However, the anterior is visually quite different.The most interesting and attractive part of the movie is that despite turning into a serious ""The Spy Saves the Day"" type of flick in various sequences, it doesn't in the least bore you.Samuel L. Jackson animates the cast . Mark Strong does a fine job with an interesting character sketch. Taron Egerton also exhibits fine acting skills .On the whole a very entertaining movie . They should produce more such movies. Reduction in violence can qualify it to be a strong candidate for classic summer blockbusters of the 90's.I found the movie quite good .",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Panders too much, subverts too little.","Kingsman: The Secret Service is the type of film that wants to be special, but it's anything but. This isn't another Austin Powers level parody of a beloved sub-genre, for better or for worse. While Bond has added the grit as of late, Kingsman tries its best to emulate it in the action and as a result, it's a film that panders too much and subverts too little. Its idea of what you least expect is a lisping Samuel L. Jackson who serves McDonald's for dinner. Nevertheless, it is enjoyable entertainment if your brain is firmly switched off. It has a nasty habit of plummeting characters into situations that are only really interesting in hindsight of their twists and as a result, they're unsatisfying until the reveal, including the now infamous church sequence. Matthew Vaughn is good at bringing a little bit of Hollywood back home so it is often cinematic though hit-and-miss with its sense of style. The film does do one thing intelligently and that's the illustration of class conflict. But the controversial joke near its end shows the standards its reaching for. Ultimately, Kingsman tries to be a franchise starter without starting with enough of worth. Beats a normal comic book adaptation I guess.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

There are no heroes or any sort of virtuous characters to latch onto. The plot is full of holes. I could go on, but suffice it to say that this is low-grade filmmaking and a waste of everyone's time.

"Original, FRESH and FUN!","I am not usually a fan of ""violent"" films per se, but there was a certain degree of ""candidness"" and ""innocence"" in the violence portrayed in this film... and that combined with great acting, action and humor made this film just simply FUN and a delight to watch.The idea of ""gentlemen"" agents is to the degree that they are not fully super""heroes"" yet they are not fully ""ordinary"" either. It gives the audience the perfect room for a perfect level of ""fantasy"" combined with reality (for instance, the tailor shop in London).There was no mucking about in this film. You are not given the time or the need to try delve into everything that is happening. You are not asking yourself 'why' is he doing that? what is the meaning behind that action? That symbol? etc. The film does not require you to wonder beyond what is necessary. In most of the ""superhero"" films these days we wonder what the back-story of the hero is - why is he the way he is? I was surprise to realize at the end of the film that not once did I really try to fathom where all these characters CAME from. They were just there doing all these amazing stunts and looking so dashing in these suits and I really appreciate that about the Kingsman. It is just PURE FUN.

The only thing that matters is the church scene.,"Ignoring the garbage follow-up and some icky sexism (I advise pushing that ""skip 30 seconds"" button on your remote when Eggsy returns to the prison cell), this is a joyful romp that remains one of my favorite action movies of all time.Listening to the dulcet tones of Mr. Darcy telling a bigot that he's a catholic whose black Jewish boyfriend is employed at an abortion clinic, and by the way hail Satan, is the height of filmmaking. Then of course we get a wonderfully choreographed fight scene after, which is hugely satisfying since everyone in that crowd deserves it.

The gentleman spy,"Kingsman wants to be a lot of things. A James Bond homage mixed with The New Avengers and a touch of The Man from Uncle. Lets throw in Eastenders as well with scenes set in a council estate pub. Taron Egerton plays the young hero Eggsy and Samantha Janus plays his mum.Kingsman is an independent spy agency with an Arthurian leaning which operates out of a gentleman's tailor shop. When one of the agent dies on duty, Colin Firth nominates a small time criminal (Eggsy) to be a replacement. Eggsy's father was also a Kingsman once.All the nominees go through a tough selection process. At the same time the organisation investigates the mysterious disappearance of some celebrities and the actions of a well known philanthropist and cyber billionaire Valentine played by Samuel L Jackson who is concerned about climate change and wants to give away free sims, free phone calls and internet.Valentine obviously watched that episode of Doctor Who where the dastardly villain used mobile phones devices to control people's emotions.Director Matthew Vaughn as with the Kick Ass films uses strong humour and cartoon violence although in this film, the violence has a video game footage look about it. I do think an anal sex gag at the end was misplaced!The film is entertaining enough, makes you laugh a few times but lacks a lot of originality. Maybe the comic book it is based on is itself been inspired by many other film and TV sources.In short its a fan-boy remake of a James Bond film from the Roger Moore era. However hearing Samuel Jackson describing spies and megalomaniacs also reminded me of the film Unbreakable which itself was about people with superpowers and super-villains and Jackson had a major role in that film as well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"What I was expecting, I didn't get. And that's a good thing!","My wife and I watched the trailer for this film two weeks ago and she wanted to see it and I didn't. Seemed a silly sendup of the spy genre badly miscast with Colin Firth in a lead role and shot in a frenetic style. Surprise, surprise. This is the most fun we've had at the movies in a long while now.Colin Firth is exactly right for his part. He deftly wavers between dead serious and quiet amusement. Not once did I think even for a moment that anyone better known for action movies could have done half as well. He's very entertaining and in a lot of ways the film revolves around him to its benefit.I found Samuel L. Jackson's lisp a bit distracting and a little off-putting, but no deal breaker. The character I was most intrigued by was Gazelle the villain's henchwoman played by an extremely comely Sofia Boutella who would make an impressive Bond girl. Throughout she's a delight to watch doing evil despite her having no feet.There's humor here and a good sense of fun. But I can't say I'm that enthused about a sequel though the main character here, Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton, is quite good. His transformation here is pretty impressive, but he's awfully young.Of course, I started out thinking the movie was going to be boring, and I was quite wrong about that.

I had a hard time understanding other reviewers that said the kid wasn't in training when clearly time was changing drastically. One minute the dog is a tiny puppy the next it's full grown adult dog. Then they go to his mothers home and the infant is now a toddler... looks like 2 or 3 years has passed. They just didn't show you the training as you have to understand that's the boring part. The saving the world was the storyline and what was important.People just need to pay more attention to understand that time passed. The tests they showed were to prove they were worth continuing on in their training.Anyway, this film started strong and went through the entire show strong. The humor is subtle and again, you have to actually pay attention and it all makes sense. At the end my husband was like, I can't wait for a sequel! I had to agree.I love the twists and turns and it kept us wondering what the evil guys game plan was. What did his invention do?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Mediocrity Disguised in a Shining Suit of Action and some Irony.,"A crazy, implausible, over-the-top storyline that is neither original nor particularly intriguing, except for some genre-typical twists, clad in a superb, tailored action-suit with the license to be self-ironic.Kingsman works as a rather violent ""Kick-Ass"" version of a James Bond spoof having a slight touch of Austin Powers.Colin Firth handles his first engagement as action hero surprisingly well since his gallant stiffness matches the character he portrays in the movie, so that all in all he did not need to change much for this role in relation to the previous roles he played; in fact his character only gets really interesting in the moments when he briefly forgets about his good manners and starts wreaking havoc.His juvenile protégé and spy-in-training ""Eggsy"" (T. Egorton) is certainly the most (or rather the sole) psychologically complex character in the movie because he is the only one undergoing an inner development from a Hooligan nobody to a Gentleman hero.However, they both are somewhat overshadowed by the lisping Samuel L. Jackson and this certainly just because of his funny lisping which makes him one of the most bizarre movie villains since ""Jaws"" in James Bond.""Gazelle"" (Sofia Boutella), the razor-harp woman and bodyguard on his side, entertains as a dangerous mixture of ""Cherry Darling"" from ""Planet Terror"" and ""Gogo Yubari"" from ""Kill Bill"".Politically incorrect killing sprees and fast-paced close-combat fighting scenes together with caricatural characters and one or two laughs constitute the fun factor of this movie which might not be enough for a more demanding viewer who has seen tons of movies like this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Original action scenes, a funny and brilliant movie that you can watch with everyone","A few action movies managed to keep me until the end. Kingsman hasn't the most original story, but from a technical perspective it is one of the best things that I watched in years. First of all, action scenes are truly amazing, camera movements really immerse you on fights, there is the right mix of special effects and practical stunts and shots are very dynamic.The cast is formed by big stars and as always Samuel L. Jackson managed to play perfectly this parody of the classic villain, as well as Colin Flirth as the gentlemen/main manager of the secret service agency.The movie is fun, and you can watch with everyone, for sure a movie that stands out, compared to the infinite action flicks that are released every year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Umbrellas have never looked this cool.,"Umbrellas have never been so badass.When I first saw the trailer for Kingsman: The Secret Service, it seemed like a bit of an eye-roller. It looked like a forgettable action comedy with stupid one-liners and standardized action built for people who like movies like Real Steel or Agent Cody Banks. I was wrong. More movies need to be like Kingsman: The Secret Service, and there are three reasons why.Reason number one: It's rated R. This movie could have easily been chopped up and delivered with a PG-13 rating, good for all ages, sans balls (I'm talking about you, Expendables 3). It wasn't. The action here is fantastic, full of glorious head trauma, exit wounds, and broken bones. One scene in particular - set in a church - is one of the coolest scenes you'll see all year.Reason number two: It's an original property. Yes, I know it's based on a comic book called 'The Secret Service', but it basically just borrows loose plot points from it. I wish more studios would take chances on unknown entities instead of churning out sequels, remakes and superhero flicks. That being said, I bet this gets a sequel...hopefully still helmed by Matthew Vaughn. When someone else takes over something that he made, we get crap like Kick-Ass 2.Reason number three: It was fun. It took itself just seriously enough that it didn't border on parody, like the last two Pierce Brosnan Bond movies that nearly killed the series (The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day). There were serious, heartfelt moments mixed in with a ton of levity. It paid a ton of homage to classic spy movies while being a blast to watch. Rarely do I leave movies saying to myself, ""I need to own that"", but this one fit that bill.The year is young, but I'm pretty confident that when 2015 is over, there will be no bigger cinematic surprise than Kingsman: The Secret Service. It's not perfect - it drags a bit at points and Samuel L. Jackson's lisp is eternally grating, but every actor aside from him is fantastic (including Colin Firth, which I never thought I'd say), the action is amazing, and the gadgets are fun. If you're into action or spy movies, Kingsman is a must see.My final grade - A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Style over substance,It's really the prime example of that all of the action sequences are great and stylish but overall the movie lacks depth due it basically being a campy spy spoof ticking off everything on the list of clichés but it's still an entertaining movie nonetheless,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
My Review!,"Casting some of the drama / serious oscar winners, you automatically tend to think that it will be one of those serious super spy action flick. But, it gave a twist I never thought would be possible with the cast. This is by far one of the best comedy spy flicks ever made. Imagine all the serious actor's given a bit of humorous scripting to play with? Although, not sure if it deserved to be in the top 250 imdb best movies list. Anyways, I would definitely watch it again. :)Peace Out!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An utterly exhilarating experience,"I didn't know this movie existed before I went into the theater to watch it. I hadn't read reviews, I hadn't seen trailers and I didn't even know it was based on a comic book (which I haven't read either). I just happened to stumble upon it in my weekly trip to the cinema and, since there wasn't anything else worth watching (that I hadn't seen) at the moment, I decided to try my luck...... Glorious, if I'm going to use one word to describe this film, it is that one. After having watched, in theaters, a string of depressive dramas and offbeat comedies (mostly last year's Oscar nominees and some art-house movies) in the past few months; this movie reminded me why I love the seventh art so much: it's just shameless, stylized, escapist and balls- to-the-wall fun.The first thing I want to comment on is the acting and I'm not going to focus on the veterans (it's pretty much a given to expect amazing performances from Firth, Jackson, Caine and Strong; even if, in the case of Firth and Jackson, their roles are quite outside their comfort zones) but on our protagonist. Egerton plays the role with panache, comfort and emotional depth unusual for someone who is pretty much doing their first big role and in an action/comedy flick no less. There's no moment in the movie in which I could say he isn't Eggsy. He clearly threw himself to it and had a blast, there's enough conflict, audacity and (to use Merlin's words) ""cheek"" to spare. And he also did most of his stunts to boot.That leads me to another fantastic asset of the movie: the stunt work. The action setpieces are just things of beauty and although everyone mentions, and with good reason, the church scene; my favorite moment occurs at the end and it involves a lot of parkour. It's mesmerizing.The comedy is also spot on and perfectly timed, Galahad's line in the church is flawless in every sense, and that's just one moment.The soundtrack, both the compositions for the movie and the pre-existing songs, fits like a glove and sets the mood of each scene seamlessly. Of particular note is one of the most inspired uses of ""Free Bird"" I've heard.In the director's seat, Vaughn does a great work of letting us see all this in the smoothest way possible, he has an eye for genial moments that he puts to great use.Here's hoping it gets enough money to warrant a sequel and this one isn't messed up like certain other of director Vaughn.All in all Kingsman gets a 10/10 from me (and it's the sixth movie I've ever watched to get that rating). I'm not claiming it is a landmark masterpiece of cinema but, as far as escapism go, this movie does achieve perfection.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Kingsman: The Secret Service,"Despite the fairly experienced cast here, this rather enjoyable rip-off of all things ""Bond"" and ""U. N. C. L. E"" really belongs to the ballsy and engaging effort from Taron Egerton. He is the young ""Eggsy"" who lives with his mum (Samantha Womack) and her gangster boyfriend ""Dean"" (Geoff Bell). After a pretty daring altercation with his goons, the youngster ends up in a police station where he remembers a gift that was given to his mother when his father mysteriously died. He calls a number, is duly sprung and introduced to the dapper ""Harry Hart"" (Colin Firth) who quickly enrols him in a school that isn't for the faint hearted. Survival here is just the start of his adventures as he is quickly embroiled in a world-domination scheme being hatched by gazillionaire ""Valentine"" (Samuel L. Jackson) - aided by his lethal-limbed hench-woman ""Gazelle"" (Sofia Boutella). Luckily he has the sagely ""Merlin"" (Mark Strong) and the versatile ""Roxy"" (Sophie Cookson) to help him - but can he thwart the dastardly plan? Jeopardy isn't high on director Matthew Vaughn's priority lists here, but entertainment and plenty of fun action-escapades are, and they deliver well. Firth is on fine form as the deadly but debonaire mentor; Sir Michael Caine adds a soupçon of class to the proceedings and Jackson looks like he is having fun in his bright red Converse trainers. It does take just a shade too long to get going, but Egerton works really well as the cheeky chappy with a brain in his head and a solid sense of common decency - particularly useful when he is facing overwhelming odds and doom lies menacingly before him. It's a great looking film, the visual effects are used sparingly and all told this is a characterful, well-written, and good fun yarn that still tips it's hat to the espionage genre - but in a playful and slightly mischievous way. Good fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

All the fun and inventiveness Bond has been lacking recently,"What a surprise this entertaining and very funny spy with an younger slant deserves to be a hit. A young delinquent whose father was a special secret agent gets recruited to join the Kingsman secret agents after a run in with the law.The effects, fight sequences and action are original which is no mean feat after all the action movies out there. There is violence but it is comic not Quentin gross. The good thing is the sense of humor that stays throughout the movie. The gadgets are inventive. There is a variety of settings and scenarios that keeps it interesting.Taron Egerton in the lead role is likable and his cockney accent is understandable. Unlike some of recent British comic action movies in the past like the Guy Ritchie movies, all the accents are quite easy to make out thank goodness. Good supporting actors with Mark Strong, Michael Caine and as well cast Colin Firth as a mentor. He is best in these kind of supporting roles.

My new favourite movie,"This movie was absolutely PERFECT! So much action, so hilarious! It makes fun of cheesy spy movies while also adding parts of them into the script! Incredible actors make this movie the greatest spy movie ever! I have already seen it 3 times in cinemas and I do plan on going as many more times as I can fit in before it ends, I'll be pre-ordering the movie as soon as I can! Such an amazing movie, I would give it PERFECT scores no matter how the ratings were recorded, 1000000000/10! I recommend it to everyone (as long as they're over 15, some parts are a bit bloody)!I've never seen Colin Firth in an action movie before and he should be in so many more, he's so great at being a spy! The other actors are also amazing, and the movie wouldn't have been the same without them!

Successful Mini-Bond film!,"2014 is shaping up to be a fantastic year for action films, with Kingsman as it's latest entry.

Other aspects of the film that are noted wins are the catchy music choice, fun and witty script and intriguing plot.

"Well, that's a different one...","Well, this was a really nice movie! It started off as a really really serious movie with spies and everything and as it evolved, it also incorporated some humor along the way. It felt at sometimes as a movie that is targeted to teens, you know, the ones that are usually aired around lunch time on weekends. Overall it was this kind of a movie for me but one with a bit more realistic effects and nicer performances as far as the cast is concerned. It would be a 6 out of 10 for me but Colin Firth kind of saved it for me. I don't know why on earth he would do such a movie but then again, Piers Brosnan did the other one with the Greek gods (Persi or sth). Overall it was a nice feeling watching the movie but it's certainly one of those movies that you know that the trailer is as good as it gets and no matter what's in it, you won't be amazed by it.Especially some of the director's findings in the end, as well as the way he portrayed some of the killings in the end were not for my taste.

Kingsmen: The Secret Service is a fantastic send up to old fashioned spy thrillers that truly kicks butt!,"The last time that my dad tuned the channel to BBC, he shut off the TV, claiming that the Brit mentality had tired him out in less then five minutes. My poor father, as I'm a big fan of British television, especially of comedies like Mr. Bean and Blackadder. It might be for the funny accent as I found their sound very fancy, but it may also be for the mindset on how they process ideas. With Doctor Who and The Avengers (not the Marvel heroes, but a spy series). I've always seen their thinking as more out of the box and oddball. Who else but the British would have come up with something like Monty Python and the Holy Grail.One of their most well known properties are the 007 spy movies. They too had that British set up as we had a super human that had a lot of strange gadgets, cool vehicles, and an actor that can both kick butt and be very suave. The course of the films have gone from being realistic to almost science fiction-like. This had put fans at a crossroads of where something like Skyfall would fall. For those that want a return to the more outrageous should come to Kingsmen: The Secret Service.While on a mission in the Middle East, secret agent Harry Hart (played by Colin Firth) witness a fellow agent killed by enemies. He visits that family back in London where he gives a young boy a medal that has a phone number to call should he need help. We cut to years later as the boy has grown into Eggsy Unwin (played by Taron Egerton), an unemployed youth whose intelligent was once training in the royal marines. He's arrested for steeling a car and finally takes up the phone number to see what happens.Eggsy get's released from jail, as paid for by Harry. With a vacant slot open, Eggsy is recruited to apply to join. He sees what Harry is capable of when he fends off a set of drunken ruffians with his fighting skills and an umbrella with gadgets. Eggsy meets up with the other possible candidates while Harry investigates billionaire Richmond Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson) with the too good to be true free cell phones and Wi-Fi he's giving away. Eggsy meets up with the head of the agency, ""Merlin"" (played by Michael Caine) but fails his next test, sending him home. But when something goes wrong and Valentine may be looking to take over the world, Eggsy may be needed to be a kingsmen after all.Kingsmen: The Secret Service made me realize that it's been a while since I've seen a spy film like this; one that totally embraces the tuxedos and fine taste along with the high tech weapons and machines. The Bourne series was a more realistic spy movie and the 007 movies still have the strangeness, but relies on being more of a blend of the old and new ideas.Kingsmen: The Secret Service is more of a comedy-action movie then anything. Oh there are some action scenes (some really good ones!), but I was surprised with how much fun I had with the spy sequences and the witty banter.Colin Firth is one actor I would have never pictured as an action hero, but I now see that no one else could have played this guy as well as he did. Samuel L. Jackson is great as always, really loving his role as the villain. Newcomer Taron Egerton is a force as he had movies like Bond and a sassy mouth that could also lead him to be a comic star. He could go wither direction.I'll give this ten umbrella guns out of ten. The Kingsmen: The Secret Service is another British creation that I hope both strikes a cord with American audiences and sparks a series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Classy, exciting and just outright entertaining.","""Manners Maketh Man.""This is one of those movies that completely takes you by surprise. I enjoyed it immensely. James Bond type-ish British spy film, but with way WAY more wack and awesomeness. Matthew Vaughn is a great director. I've watched all of his films (except Layer Cake) and the guy just has a knack of delivering really enjoyable/entertaining movies (Stardust, Xmen - First class, Kick ass).The cast delivered great performances all round. Colin Firth simply KICKED ASS. Loved his character and how classy yet deadly he was. Taron Egerton, the protagonist, was some nobody to me before I saw this movie. Now, he is a star in the making. Samuel L.Jackson, while didn't stole the show or anything, was a pretty good villain with a funny lisp condition.The plot actually felt somewhat fresh and wasn't your typical 'Take over the world' type scenarios that you see in this genre. Although I have see the main mechanism elsewhere, the reasons for doing, the justification and all that was something that I could standby with. Also, the movie had some messages about over reliance on smartphones, privacy hacks etc which I really liked.Coming to the action, let me just say that it was just awesome. The pacing was so well done that many scenes had me on the edge of my seat with my heart thumping like crazy. The hand to hand scenes were also well executed. Full of gore, long takes, class and no excessive shaky cam and fast cuts bullshit. Add dark humor layer to it all and it was just a wonder to watch it all. The Church scene in particular really WOWED me.Sound effects and OSTs were also perfectly edited in scenes, enhancing the experience, adding more adrenaline, class, humor etc as required.The only complaint I had was that the movie tried to develop some romance and while I'm REALLY glad it didn't linger on it, it did kinda felt out of place and just tacked on.Overall, it's the best movie of this year so far for me. I just hate myself for not seeing it in the cinema.8.6/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"A screenplay that verges on the point of trolling, but with cool action scenes.","The movie started off pretty well, but it soon went downhill when I realized what kind of movie this was. Such troll, would be how I would describe this movie. The jokes are so corny that it just felt too ridiculous. OK, it was quite funny at times but not enough to make up for the rest of the ridiculousness.The story itself is also a little typical. We have the bad guy, corrupt people in high places, the good guys, and the novice spy who becomes a professional during a crisis. And though I should be glad that this film did not have a typical romantic ending, in this case I will make an exception.The character of the bad guy played by Samuel Jackson is just so offensive that I can't believe it. First off, he is of dark skin, which wouldn't really have made a difference except that in this case he had a lisp. So on top of being overall racist (black person playing a bad guy), they are emphasizing that racism by giving him a speech impediment (black people can't speak). I am hoping that this is the result of them so subtly bringing to light issues/ stereotypes by blatantly showing it.The swearing and the gore. Oh my goodness. Really not necessary and adding to the ridiculous factor. I'm not a fan of swearing at all, but in some cases I concede that it actually helps to get the point across. But overusing it is definitely too much. The gore in fighting scenes too was a little much. The fireworks is ridiculous.Though the gore was too explicit, the action scenes were actually pretty good. In fact, they were great. The camera work, fighting, editing, all worked together to create great action scenes. The music helped too.There is a lot of big names in this, and they all played their part relatively well, but it does not change my mind about what I think about this film. I am also thinking that a lot of the humour in this film is 'British' so it is subtly but in a blatant way, showing all the things wrong in cinema or the world today. I don't know. Please let it be satirical.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A sit back & go with the flow romp. Violent, bloody & hugely entertaining.","Adapted from the acclaimed comic book by Jane Goldman (Stardust, The Woman in Black) and directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Kick-Ass) Kingsman: The Secret Service is a sit back, put your feet up, go with the flow romp. It doesn't pretend to be anything else, and it achieves its goals admirably.Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is an agent with a super-secret undercover organization hidden behind the façade of an exclusive tailor's outlet in London. When one of the Kingsman agents is killed in action, a brief, intensive selection process begins through which a replacement will be found. Whilst the majority of the potential recruits are public school educated and born with silver spoons in their mouths, Harry's proposition is Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), a streetwise kid from the wrong side of town and a pitiful history. With death or expulsion the penalty for failing each task, Eggsy battles prejudice as well as aptitude tests in a bid to become a Kingsman.From the opening titles of Kingsman: The Secret Service we know we're up for fun. The credits tumble out like rocks from exploding walls as Vaughn sets the tone of adventure and derring-do. We think we know where we're going but Goldman and Vaughn have formed a reliable partnership that maintains the ability to surprise, to appall and to shock simultaneously. This is tongue-in-cheek, logic be damned magic.Throughout Kingsman: The Secret Service we are treated to bloody, violent, beautiful choreography that leaves us wincing, laughing and admiring the audacity of the mayhem they spread across the screen. The church sequence is a marvel to behold and a scene that Tarantino must wish he had created first. As for the grand, spectacular finale, well, let's just say you've never seen fireworks like this! It is a visual triumph that is, in an odd kind of way, mind-expanding. Riotous, beautiful and very funny indeed.One of the great joys of Goldman's and Vaughn's collaborations is that they seem not to care too much what anybody thinks. They just do it. They know the rules and they play the Hollywood game but they do it their way. Product placement has long been a standard of filmmaking, and though there is plenty of it on display here, one particular example is the funniest, classiest most blatant since, well, ever!Like Goldman's and Vaughn's other work, Kingsman: The Secret Service doesn't take itself seriously. It is joyfully camp at times, frequently taking digs at the genre it is mocking. In the Roger Moore years, James Bond became a buffoon, an unbelievable pastiche of himself. Here, Bond gets a makeover and frivolous fun is on the agenda throughout. All the ingredients are here: a super villain, excess, beauty and gadgets. This is gadget heaven and umbrellas have suddenly become cool.Colin Firth is clearly having an absolute blast as the suave agent. Who needs Paddington to boost your cinematic profile when you can shoot, stab, smash and bludgeon this stylishly? Firth is a class act and this is proof once again that there is far more to him than simply the stiff upper lip persona.Samuel L. Jackson is on scenery munching duty the as Valentine, a twisted tech genius holding the world to ransom under the guise of being its savior, and why not? There's a certain amount of ham in his performance but it works perfectly here and he's in good company.Egerton makes for a fine, watchable secondary hero that we may perhaps find it easier to identify with but he's not in the same league as Colin Firth or Michael Caine and does not easily drag our attention away from them. Mark Strong's accent takes a little while to settle in but he, too, brings light humour and a certain gravitas to Kingsman: The Secret Service, as we have come to expect from his presence.There are plenty of gaps in the plot (at what point does Eggsy actually learn to fight properly?), and occasionally the humour is a little too obvious and slips below the level Vaughn sets, but all of these glitches and flaws are forgivable when a film is this much fun.Unfortunately, when a film is as much fun as Kingsman: The Secret Service, the temptation (and pressure from the studio) must surely be there to forge a sequel. Let's hope Goldman and Vaughn resist that money making exercise and leave Kingsman to stand proudly as a unique experience that thrills and entertains completely.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Low brow James Bond for the millenial pea brains,"Spy movie with some interesting ideas and touches but the overuse of foul language, crass bum sex references and church scene really cater to the lowest common denominator which these days seems to be the norm and movies just seem to strive for the mediocre like the vast majority of our pea brained reality tv generation which i find utterly soul destroying.Call me a snob but i prefer the days of good stories with decent acting without the need for the ""f"" word in every sentence and overt sexual references and mind numbing pointless violence in every scene.I am not giving the movie a 1 or 2 out of ten like some of the reviewers who rate a movie on knee jerk reactions, its an average; very average 5 from me and without crass use of violence, foul language and gutter trash sexual references etc I would have possibly rated it a little higher!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Strangely entertaining,"If you are in the right mood, this film can be quite great. Twice I've tried to watch this movie, but never finished it because I was baffled by this strange concept. Now that the third film is in theaters, I thought to give the series another chance.My favorite thing to do is watch a movie without knowing exactly beforehand what's going to happen, who all is in it, or who wrote the script or directed it. Still, with some productions, it makes sense to know beforehand. With Thor: Ragnarok, I knew that Taika Waititi was directing and that it would be completely different from the previous MCU productions.Kingsman bears the signature of Matthew Vaughn, who was responsible for Kick-Ass, among others. And in the end, Kingsman is similarly twisted, as if a British Tarantino had been allowed to shoot a new James Bond film persiflage with Taron Egerton, Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson.The less seriously you take the film, the more entertaining it is. It has a lot of details, a dope cast, great production design, is bloody, brutal, funny, and has almost no boundaries.

Everything You Hope For And More,"Part of the genius of Matthew Vaughn's films is his ability to blend genres. Whether it was First Class, Kick-Ass, or even The Debt, he has time and time showed just how versatile he can be. This film is straight up awesome. I found myself laughing at just how ridiculous it was, but it worked. The film is also incredibly funny by itself make no mistake about it. It's also very self aware, much like the Fast & Furious franchise, in that it toys with the fact that it knows it's insane and has fun with it.I have to say though, I didn't have high hopes when they announced the film a few years back. Why would Vaughn leave Days of Future Past to work on some film called Kingsman? Luckily, both films turned out to be terrific. The casting directors also deserve a lot of credit for finding Taron Egerton. Talk about a young kid who should probably be looked at for the new Peter Parker, man does he have talent. He also has something that other possible candidates don't necessarily have, which is comedic chops. This film has more laugh out loud moments than the recent SpongeBob film. Samuel L Jackson gives us many of those humorous scenes, as this is probably the best he has been in quite some time. His trusty Bond villain-esque sidekick is also a bright spot. Or perhaps the cinematography and special effects crew should be credited for just how seamless these action scenes are. This is likely the closest we will ever get to a non Gareth Evans Raid film.The film is also impeccably unpredictable. It's refreshingly to see the action genre get revamped a little bit. Even the best action films can be predictable at times. It's funny because I feel like I should have seen some of the twists and turns coming, but it's a tribute to Vaughn's directing that I didn't. Some may say that the action can be a little bit too over-the-top even for a film that acknowledges it's own boundary-pushing. There was one moment where I thought it probably didn't need to take it that far, but it was still immensely entertaining. I really do hope that this spawns a franchise. Egerton has a lot of potential, and this world deserves to be explored further. It's a film that even my sister, who isn't particularly a fan of these types of films, really enjoyed the experience. It's a much better choice than that one other film people are seeing this weekend...+Egerton's surprisingly good performance+Samuel L hasn't been this entertaining in years+Unpredictable+Over-the-top action works+Potential franchise-Don't get too obsessed with that ridiculousness9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Nice movie...,"""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch a young man being recruited by a spy organisation to join their training program in order to become a spy. After that he has to deal with a global threat and try to save every person on Earth.I enjoyed this movie because it was interesting, funny and it contained plenty of action. The combination of action with comedy was very good and the result was very pleasant. The direction which was made by Matthew Vaughn was very good and he did a great job on it. Regarding the interpretations of both Colin Firth who played as Harry Hart / Galahad and Taron Egerton who played as Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin were equally good and their combination worked very well. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Samuel L. Jackson's who played as Valentine and Mark Strong's who played as Merlin. To sum up, I have to say that ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is an entertaining movie and I am sure that you will enjoy it, too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Fantastic Fun, A Reinvention Of The Spy Film Game For A Modern Age","As a fan of the comic, I will say this, Kingsman actually manages to trump it's source material in many ways. Taking what we know about Spy films: the gadgets, the villain, the prestige, even the action, Kingsman gives us street level flair here by essentially reinventing the Bond formula and kicking it in the teeth. It's an exciting, action packed, and fun film that conforms to Matthew Vaughn's stylish take on the comic book film. Eggsy is a smart, talented young man living with his mom and her boyfriend in London with a penchant for trouble. With his dad having died when he was a child, Eggsy has lived a rough life dodging the law and local thugs. But when an old associate of his father's enters his life, he's given the opportunity to put his talents to good use and become part of an elite group of spies.What a blast. From beginning to end, this movie is entertaining. And this is mostly thanks to the actors rounded up here. Colin Firth brings his usual wonderful skills as an actor, but it's his combat skills that make him so entertaining. Essentially the old fashioned James Bond of the film, Firth is as suave as ever, but he also commits violence that goes unparalleled in the film. This is most demonstrated in one of the film's biggest set pieces, taking place at a southern church which was briefly shown in the trailer. He steals the show, but the surrounding performances are just as great. Taron Egerton, a stranger to the States, is excellent as Eggsy. While this could have been a character who came off as thuggish and criminal, Eggsy is actually quite sympathetic from early in the film. He's clearly smart and a guy who wants to protect his mom and see her have a better life. However, like so many these days, he feels burdened by his lot in life and it has turned him into a less than stellar citizen. His transformation from a troubled kid to a master spy is incredibly entertaining and combines the charm and sophistication of the typical spy film with the rough edge of a street level action film. Sam Jackson brings the ham as an unusual villain, Mark Strong plays one of the most entertaining characters in the film as the youngsters spy trainer, and Michael Caine appears as the head of Kingsman, bringing his usual mix of seasoned professionalism and sense of fun.As for the film itself, Matthew Vaughn does as good a job here as his previous comic book adaptations. He continues to demonstrate how to make a film fun, exciting, and hip without it being overly cheesy or appear to be trying too hard. He seems almost a perfect match up for Mark Millar's work, as he is able to almost perfectly convey Millar's mixture of rough edge, sense of fun, and intriguing bend of known tropes. In terms of breaking down a genre, this is similar to Kick Ass in that sense. The action is as superb as you would expect and we're always allowed to see it, with a lack of dizzying close ups and shaky cam, which is thankful. The climax is especially rousing and exciting, with plenty of varied action bits, from gun fights to a dual between Sofia Boutella's deadly, prosthetic leg wearing assassin and Eggsy.It's something of a surprise to find this film playing in a month usually reserved for films studios have little faith in. This is summer blockbuster material and fantastic entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Good action movie...great satirical masterpiece,"I went to watch this movies with mixed expectations;a friend said it was stupid and a complete waste of time, the ratings on IMDb claimed otherwise. In my opinion, those who think the movie is stupid or has a weak plot, did not get past the thin veil that looks stupid. Digging a little you get to realize the real issues that the movie wishes to highlight.The movie has some humorous and light-hearted moments but too much violence and action to be classed as a comedy, I can compare this to DR Strangelove by Stanley Kubrick. This is not a stupid movie or a waste of time as claimed by some, I recommend you to watch it and be the judge; however,if you like to watch uncomplicated,easy to understand movies and traditional plot styles...THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF MOVIE.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Another Great And Hyper-Violent Mark Millar Comic Book Adaptation,"If there is one individual who has most recently become a true legend in the world of comic book writing, then it would have to be Mark Millar. With works like Nemesis, Kick-Ass, Wanted, Marvel's Civil War, Old Man Logan, and Ultimate X-Men and Fantastic Four under his belt, Millar has managed to follow in the footsteps of classic comic book writers like Alan Moore, Frank Miller, Will Eisner, and Neil Gaimen, and like many of these artists, Millar has been able to see and even assist in watching many of his works be adapted for the silver screen.For Millar, film adaptations of his work have had mixed, but interesting degrees of success. Wanted (2008) was a stylish and adrenaline-pumping experience with some great performances by Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman, but I do admit that the actual film was an awful adaptation considering the story and characters had almost nothing to do with the comic. Kick-Ass (2010) was a gleefully violent, hilarious, and faithful adaptation of Millar's work that helped jumpstart the careers of Chloë Grace Moretz and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, not to mention it featured the last truly impressive performance by Nicolas Cage, and while Kick-Ass 2 (2013) was far inferior to its predecessor, it was still a decent adaptation.Now we have Kingsman: The Secret Service (2015), which while only loosely based on Millar's The Secret Service, is still a funny, well-acted, and beautifully ridiculous action film that more Hollywood studios should observe and copy in the future. Also, this film should make Liam Neeson nervous; he's not the only older actor who can pull off action movie roles. Welcome to the action ring, Colin Firth!The plot of Kingsman is very much in the same vein as a classic James Bond film, and the film is not afraid to make fun at Bond's expense (or even Jason Bourne for that matter). The film focuses on Eggsy (Taron Egerton), an unemployed London resident who has a cowardly mother and an abusive stepfather, and has spent his entire life giving up in situations where he could have easily succeeded (school, the military, etc.). After getting arrested by the police, Eggsy makes contact with a long-lost ally, Harry Hart/Galahad (Colin Firth), who happens to be a member of an organization known as the Kingsman: individuals who pose as sophisticated tailors and businessmen who in reality have become the new ""Knights of the Round Table"", and work to protect the world and keep it in balance.Eggsy is then offered a chance to become a Kingsman like his late father before him, and must compete with other hopeful (and privileged) candidates like Roxy (Sophie Cookson), all the while under the watchful eye of Merlin (Mark Strong), a senior Kingsman and trainer. Meanwhile, Galahad, under orders from Chester King/Arthur (Michael Caine), is sent to investigate lisp-ridden billionaire, philanthropist and tech tycoon Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) and his bladed prosthetic leg-equipped assistant Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), who seek to drive the world into chaos and create a new world order, and eventually Eggsy and Roxy have to join the fight, and gleeful violence and action ensues.The plot is clearly inspired by the James Bond films of old, but director Mathew Vaughn and long-time collaborator and writer Jane Goldman, who've created excellent films like Stardust (2007), Millar's Kick-Ass (2010), and X-Men: First Class (2011), manage to keep the film deliciously retro and fresh. The story is great, the action is frenetic and edgy, and reminded me of Vaughn's previous work in Kick-Ass, and the performances are all excellent. Firth is great as Galahad, and I would love to see him star in more action films. Egerton and Cookson are solid in their roles, and it'll be interesting to see what future starring roles they'll partake in. Strong, Jackson, Caine, and Boutella all have moments to shine in the film. Mark Hamill and Jack Davenport are also funny in roles that could be chalked up as cameos, but their roles are important in driving the plot forward.The only criticism I have with the film are that in some instances the special effects are decent, but you can tell that they are just CGI. The same held true with Kick-Ass, and even X-Men: First Class; Vaughn is able to craft great movies on relatively small budgets, but focuses more on using great actors and a story rather than effects, and there is nothing wrong with that. It's just on a few occasions the effects were so obvious that I was pulled out of the experience. Also, while the humor in the film is really great, there were one or two moments where the comedy felt designed to be shocking and perverse but in no way to drive the plot forward, but that's mostly a warning for anyone who doesn't like seeing those kinds of things.Overall, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a fantastic action flick with a great story, excellent acting performances, awesome humor, and some jaw-dropping action scenes. If James Bond were to ever become rated R and hyper-violent, I think this would be the film to copy. Also, like Kick-Ass, Vaughn knows how to use classic rock songs in his action sequences. In my opinion, Vaughn and Goldman are the two individuals who are able to make excellent and worthy film adaptations of Mark Millar's work, and Kingsman is no different. Simply put, it's one of the best action films of the past few years, and should be seen by any fan of the action/spy/comic book movie genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"If you know what you're signing on for, you'll love it. If you don't, why are you going to see this?","Here's what trend I am noticing with these reviews. With rare exceptions, it's getting either a 1/10 or a 10/10, which means for this movie to have a stellar 8/10 IMDb score, for every one person that gives it a bad review, four people have to give it a perfect review. This is a rough calculation obviously, but it's actually important to my review. Instead of looking at this as, 4/5 people liked this movie, I look at this as everyone who likes this genre of movie, liked this movie. Now, why do I make such a claim? Read the negative reviews. Every review is about how there is too much violence or the plot being over the top. What did you expect walking into this. Look at the rating and the reasons for the rating. Watch the trailer. Read one review for the movie. Watch the other movies by this director. Take your pick. These are all indicative of what the movie was actually like. These reviews are basically akin to ""I didn't like the Avengers because there was too many superheroes."" I'm not implying you should know every little thing about every movie you see, but shouldn't you at least know the general idea of what you're getting into? Ranting aside for how people don't educate themselves before spending their money, if you like these types of movies, you'll adore this one. I'm beating a dead horse, but it's a British Kick A**. Plain and simple. It's unique, quirky, humorous, enjoyable, and fun. They do a great job of mixing action with comedy, much like the aforementioned title. Honestly, I laughed more during this than any comedy movie I've seen in years. I'd prefer to keep this review entirely spoiler free, so I won't be giving any examples of witty lines or particularly memorable action sequences, but believe me, they exist.There were so many unexpected bright points from the movie as well. Samuel L. Jackson's character was beyond amazing. I certainty didn't see that coming. The plot, although indeed over the top, was extremely clever at certain points in the movie. There's some predictable twists, but a lot of the interview test scenes were handled very cleverly. The whole British twist on the movie added something fresh as well. As someone who generally doesn't personally like British movies or even the culture (no offense intended, just not my cup of tea...pun intended), I found it to be a welcome theme for this particular movie.There were a few tiny grievances I had, however. They probably didn't need to swear as much as they did, but that's just a personal preference and not anything actually wrong with the movie. I also thought the music wasn't that great. Maybe I'm spoiled from Kick-A**'s, well...kick-a** soundtrack, especially during fight scenes, but I wasn't feeling it for this movie. The universal complaint I seem to see in these reviews that I'll agree with too is the gratuitous last three seconds of the movie. It was kind of demeaning and added nothing to the movie. But(t...another pun? :) ), we all know why it was there. Sex sells. There's not much you can do about that at this point.All in all, if you liked Kick-A**, you WILL like this movie. If you like stylized action, you'll like this movie. If you like James Bond, you'll probably like this movie. If you like unique movies, you'll like this movie. If you're easily offended by excessive violence, you will not like this movie. It's, for the most part, not even that gory; just violent. It's as simple as that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

From chav to gentleman in two hours,"It's actually a rare occasion that you see a movie based on a comic book about British people. Until i managed to recall V for Vendetta, i thought it's my first rendezvous with a material of such sort. Especially since it revolves around a figure of an English gentleman, and who can be a more unlikely comic book hero than a tea-drinking suit-wearing umbrella-cane-carrying snob?Well, this is where it gets interesting. Because, although our main gentleman figure is played by Colin Firth, a seasoned veteran of Regency era courtships and chivalry, it's not gonna be a Pride and Prejudice of any sort. What we have here is a modern day dandy spy squad. But it's not just James Bond dressed for Royal Ascot. It's more like Captain America dressed (and mannered) for the same sort of thing. Fancy, ain't it?But, as with a recipe for a proper Martini, all the ingredients, including the last one, are equally important. And, as a cherry (or should i say an olive) on top, we have here a little social confrontation, because our modern time knight with impeccable looks and manners chooses as his apprentice a young chav'ish guy, who's equally talented and troublesome.At this point, i believe that anyone who's at least mildly interested in the action/adventure movie genre will be intrigued to the limit. And they should be, because Kingsman: The Secret Service delivers a today's interpretation of the ages old fairy tale about a commoner who rose up and got into the highest ranks thanks only to his courage, wits and honor. And this time, instead of bows and swords, we have shotguns and super spy gadgets.Surely, as any fairy tale, Kingsman is hardly a sci-fi. So don't expect much plausibility here, since what's believable is not always fun. Instead, enjoy how marvelously graphic this movie is, how brilliantly the fighting scenes are filmed and how insanely surreal (or surreally insane) the main villain is. It takes a courage and some wild imagination to actually transform the current collective subconscious into a figure of flesh and blood and make this figure really evil, but only evil enough to still take it seriously. Because, as we know from the old Bond movies, the over-the-top baddies cause more laugh than fright, and we don't want the audience to laugh before the punch line, do we?But no matter how gentleman material you are, it's hard not to get your suit wrinkled and specked a bit when it's raining punches and bullets. So, while Kingsman is light-hearted and jolly enough to be on par with Kick-Ass, it certainly lacks some depth and character development. Surely, we see how Eggsy, the ballsy (no pun intended) Galahad's protégé, goes from that council housing punk to well-esteemed gentleman with fighting skills straight from The Matrix. What we don't see is some real, not fairy tale sort of, challenge he has to overcome to become what he becomes. Just a bit of brawling with some higher-born competitors and one skydiving trick - that's all. He doesn't even seem to break a sweat, which falls in line with the fairy tale style, but lacks realism so much that it undermines the value of the achievement somewhat. And yes, there's product placement. So explicit and blatant that they even make Colin Firth endorse McDonald's as a part of a dialogue. I try not to be a snob, but that was a bit too much.So, while Kingsman is hardly a movie that would hold you enthralled on a re-watch, it's still entertaining enough for your first date to be pleasant. It's fresh enough, funny enough, and who would skip an opportunity to see Colin Firth kicking major ass for three minutes straight? Not me for sure. And neither should you, because for that alone watching Kingsman can be a lifetime experience ;).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Cheap Plot but a Classy Film,"Let's face it every spy movie will always have a cheap plot. It's how they execute their idea that's what should be the main criteria of judging the movie.

And although it's not as classy as James Bond, it has surely managed to entertain us in a ""Gentleman's Way"".The characters may seem like a bunch of stereotypes. But if you stick with it, you'll realize they are not exactly our regular stereotypes.There are some powerful actors. But the acting is kind of disappointing.The best part of this movie is the action scenes. And while they are the most amazing actions I've seen in a very long time, it felt like they lacked something else.Another clever thing about Kingsman is the subplots. What this film lacked in the main plot, partially made up with it's subplots. I'm not gonna spoil them by giving any example.Final verdict: 7.4/10, you have got to watch it.

Some scenes, as in the church, are just disgusting, and from that point the interest level wanes. The scenes in the mountain lair are INCEPTION meets ON HER MAJESTYS SECRET SERVICE with absurd and endless killing which ultimately made me feel ill. 30 minutes too long and from a clown copycat director, this film is great initially, for 60 minutes and then irritating and vile for 70 minutes. Yes the damn thing runs 130 minutes. I really did feel sick and exhausted when it finished. I thought it all a shocking waste of production money time and the studio's trust.

Yes!,"Kingsman deserves better than listing comparisons of it to other films. So let me get it out of the way: Imagine a cartoonier Bond film, influenced by Edgar Wright's brainy editing, with Wanted's unabashed silliness, Kill Bill's oddly gorgeous violence, and Guardians of the Galaxy-style comic book humor and you begin to get the picture. Above all, it's an absolute blast of pure movie fun. Boasting a great cast of perfectly matched characters and actors, kinetic scifi action choreography, and tons of slyly intentional silliness, Kingsman is funny, ultra-violent, and bursting with vibrant color. The Kingsman is a secret British organization that combats against the biggest of Earth's threats currently looking to replace one of its most recent lost members. Its structure has the skin of the ubiquitous YA-novel-turned-film genre, only much rougher. With director Vaughn at the helm, my fear was that Kingsman would be similar to many of his recent efforts: an interesting but ultimately sad miss. Blatant product placement and a couple too-clever-for-its- own-good jokes aside, this is happily not the case. Led by the classy and surprisingly action-inclined Firth as the elder statesmen of the group, the movie chugs along with inspired verve. It's also really smart. Themes like the presumptuous danger of playing God and personal honor vs. public persona bring just enough moral complexity to put it above films of its type. However, the boldly big goofiness that propels the film is never far from sight. Kingsman is a super smart action thriller that won't disappoint anyone wise enough to skip 50 Shades of Grey.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Clubbed to death,"A private club of assassins locks horns with an effete billionaire bent on world depopulation, so the club turns to an underdog recruit to see off the beastly chap.Good acting and pace. Humour is a bit patchy - there's a flash of porn ass at the very end, so clearly Carry On humour just ... carries on. But the final third is a complete riot, from the scene in the church onward - I guess thanks to the director's worship of Hong Kong action films. Colin Firth did his own stunts. LOL. The fights are a bit repetitive in style, although amazing to behold, and it goes full 007 parody in the end.Overall, though, it lacks the satire of the equally ambitious Iron Sky.The problem I have is with the politics. This is a real London film - loads of money to deliver a stylish, full-on neoliberal message that Big Men Rule, democracy and liberty are sideshows. The members of the club might as well be sitting round the cabinet table in Downing Street.At one point the hero says saving Thatcher from assassination was a pity, but Thatcherism runs right through this story.

Kingvaughn: The Kingsvaughn: The Director Brings a Quality Action Film and Makes Colin Firth an Action Star,"Young Critic 2/18/2015 It's nice to have these kinds of surprises in the winter season of rubbish. Along with Paddington, the wide release of American Sniper, and now the surprising and bold Kingsman: The Secret Service it's turning out to be a good winter season. Going in to see Kingsman, I expected the typical action-spy thriller with the high stakes, stunts, and evil villain, but I wasn't expecting an artistically directed film with a perfect contemporary plot and courageously pushed comedy. Director Matthew Vaughn did it yet again with the help of veteran and rookie actors who pushed out of their comfort zones.Kingsman is adapted from a comic series that was first published in 2011. The premise of the film is that of a young English troublemaker named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who is recruited by a Kingsman agent named Galahad (Colin Firth). The Kingsman service is basically a continuation of King Arthur's knights. They are an organization more secret and discreet than MI6, and their work goes largely unrewarded (Galahad's office is covered with the front pages of newspapers the day after all his successful missions). Eggsy is tested and evaluated along with other recruits to fill a vacant spot of a murdered Kingsman. As Eggsy trains we find out that the assassination of the Kingsman agent is Silicon Valley billionaire Valentine's (Samuel L. Jackson) fault. Valentine has an evil plan that actually ends up being less absurd and is worrying for most of the audience; it plays around with our ubiquitous smart phone usage and with the climate change problem. Valentine's plan (if you don't mind my revealing it) is that through his phone products he can trigger a violent and uncontrolled part of the human brain that would cause an unfiltered surge of violence. This evil plan would cause death and bloodshed, but it would also get rid of the problem of overpopulation, global warming, and even extinction animal species. As Valentine says: ""Humans are like a virus. When you get a virus your body heats up, trying to kill the virus, and that's what the earth is doing."" The smart line made me think of global warming in a way I hadn't before. Now of course I'm not defending or rooting for Valentine and his plan at all, I would much rather cheer for an awesome fighting Colin Firth.The genius of this film comes from director Matthew Vaughn. His film resume includes Kick- Ass and X-Men: First Class, both really good films that also stood out from other action films for their boldness and originality. I admire Vaughn for being so risky with his films; in Kick-Ass he went on to mock the very genre that was becoming the highest grossing and most popular genre in the world. With First Class, he retook the decayed ­X-Men franchise (and a superhero film) and revived it by unerringly replacing the whole cast, making it a prequel, and mixing the historical, dramatic, and comedic genres. With Kingsman he avoids falling into the standard clichés, by riskily conducting his action sequences (one is a huge massacre in a church, another depicts a woman tearing down a door wanting to murder a child, exploding heads at a cocktail party that turn into fireworks) and he doesn't shy away from adult humor (usually coated or avoided by action films that want to play it ""safe""). His touches of auteur-ship are seen and faintly remind us of Tarantino with scenes such as the exploding heads one, which is tuned to ""Pomp and Circumstance,"" or with the snappy and extremely smart dialogues that seem out of place, but ground the characters' humanity. But the greatest feat of all is that Vaughn avoids being predictable, some important characters die, which you don't expect at all and there are some unseen betrayals. These surprises make us be on the edge of our seat, actually fearful for the stakes of our characters.But having a great director only takes you so far; the spectacular cast was a big factor in attracting an audience and keeping their rapt attention. The star of the marketing campaign for the film was Colin Firth, but you would never expect Colin Firth to be an action star. Firth was known for his gentlemanlike roles in all his films from Love Actually to Pride and Prejudice and even in The King's Speech. In Kingsman he plays a badass secret agent, but nevertheless the role is suited for him (that's meant to be a pun). The Kingsman service is unique in that their agents dress in expensive suits and carry umbrellas, heavy rimmed glasses, and gold watches and rings. Firth fits perfectly into this agency, it was almost made for him. He succeeds not only by pulling his own stunts, but also by maintaining a cold and straight face throughout the entire film, smirking once or twice after some awesome stunt or another. If I may be so bold it was the first time that we've seen the wide range of Firth's abilities, he had been enclosed previously to one type of character. We also have the more than worthy Taron Egerton, who plays the lead role and whose transformation from London lowlife to gentleman agent is extremely smooth. I hope to see more of him, be it in future Kingsman films or in other films. Finally, we have very notable contributions from supporting actors: Michael Cane and Mark Strong, who both are Kingsmen in the film. And of course we have Samuel L. Jackson, having the time of his life playing a villain with a lisp and cackling evilly.The great chemistry in the cast along with the spectacular and bold directing from Matthew Vaughn make this a needed tribute to the 007 films that at the same time spawn a quality and enjoyable franchise.

Film Review: Kingsman: The Secret Service,"Upon first glance, Kingsman: The Secret Service looks like an outdated, outlandish attempt to reinvigorate the action spy genre that saw Pierce Brosnan fail miserable as his final appearance as the famous spy-agent James Bond in The World is Not Enough. Since 2005, thanks to the likes of Martin Campbell and Christopher Nolan, two directors that took two very different iconic action figures, Batman and James Bond, and injected a much needed, gritty, dark, reality-based foundation to these characters and their overall narratives, over-the-top action has long been expired. In the last decade, what has arisen, is a very dark and realistically twisted take on many action icons, both in the superhero genre and the action hero genre, that allows the cartoonish elements of these characters to fade, and the realistic to rise in popular and rewarding box office results.One of these aforementioned films that inhabited a reality based narrative structure was the recently re-envisioned X-Men film franchise, which was, ironically, reinvented by Matthew Vaughn in X-Men: First Class in 2011. The film, which took place in 1962, set around the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis, showed just how much the comic book genre succeeded among audiences when introduced around real-world events.The amazing thing about Kingsman: The Secret Service, is that the same man who was responsible for breathing new, raw life into the X-Men franchise, after the disaster that Brett Ratnet's X-Men: The Last Stand was, is the same man that is bringing back the absolutely manic and outrageous spy-agent genre with a vengeance. Thankfully for everyone, Kingsman: The Secret Service is the action movie we have been waiting to see and the is the tremendously alternative to a highly unbelievable 007 movie that never came.Upon first view, I too was worried about the dynamics of Vaughn's newest Millar adaptation (Vaughn had already adapted Millar's Kick-Ass). Looking back at the trailers, the action looked silly; the players too clichéd in the world of agent-spy standards; and gimmicky thanks to the inclusion of adorable pugs and attractive cast members. Boy was I wrong!Kingsman is a highly calculated film romp that never takes itself too seriously, yet never lets go of its grip of highly entertaining action movie and escapism Hollywood fluff. To think that Vaughn could have potentially abandoned this project completely to make X-Men: Days of Future Past is sad. Thankfully, the highly visionary and confident filmmaker stuck to his guns, and delivers easily, one of the most entertaining films of 2015 thus far.Kingsman begins as any action movie should; with a girl. But this girl, is a recently widowed mother who surprisingly has a stranger visit her in the late night, to tell her that her husband, a Kingsman (unbestknown to her) was killed in the line of duty. The stranger, Harry Hart (Colin Firth), is unwelcome in the home, and focuses his energy to his partners newborn son, Eggsy (newcomer Taron Egerton), where he discloses to him that, if ever in the future he encounters any problems, the Kingsman are indebted to them forever thanks to the bravery of their patriarch.Flash forward a decade, and Eggsy is a troublesome youth, whose failed attempts in the marines, and trouble with the law finds his luck at the crap end, time and time again. It isn't until Eggsy, who in an act of defiance for his mother against her petty mafia boyfriend, finds himself in a police station, in deperate need of the Kingsmans help. After a quick phone call, that ends ambiguously, Eggsy is released of the police station and greeted by the same man who visited him and his mother upon the news of his father's death, Harry Hart. Luckily for Eggsy, Harry offers him a job interview, that could see him in the same line of work as his father, and could change his world forever thanks to an unexpected visit to a tailor shoppe.On the surface, Kingsman seems to be a neat and well dressed action film. Once cracked open, Kingsman is a rough, tough, cocky-filled fuel ride of adrenaline, bad manners and tailored attitude that puts James Bond and company to shame.Vaughn, whose decision to keep the material in his native English tongue, complete with attitude-filled cockney accents and strong British accents, breaths new life to the very apocalyptic world take over plans of the film's villain, and easily the best and most iconic villain of 2015, Richmond Valentine, played with such bravado and vigour by the astonishing Samuel L. Jackson. I know what your thinking. How in the hell can Jackson, whose playing a villain with a bad and wholly unnecessary lisp, offer any bravado and vigour to a role that is more comical than anything? My answer to you, is that you just watch the film and see for yourself. In addition to being one of the best aspect of Kingsman along with his highly inventive and wholly contemporary scheme to rid the virus known as mankind, Valentine, as well as the film itself, is a highly meticulous and thought-out tongue and cheek ode to the many iconic and memorable films and film villains of the early 70's and 80's. One of the best dialogues in the film, when Valentine and Hart meet for the first time, and indulge in some fine, wholly signature American cuisine, the two discuss, each of their displeased thoughts with the current state of spy, action movies. ""A spy movie is only as good as its villain"", says Valentine, in which Hart agrees formidable. I can only imagine how big of a grin screenwriters Jane Goldman and Vaughn himself had penning the script to this film with that notion in mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A mix-up James bond copycat for teenagers,"For those who believe James Bond has become too serious in his old age, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" restores the British espionage genre's irreverence, delivering a younger, streetwise take on the 007 formula while joyously pushing the favorite. The audience's ingredients - sartorial taste, homicidal toys, and explosive supervillains - are taken to dramatic extremes. The out-of-the-box Fox franchise presents itself as a more sophisticated option, based on the 2012 Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons comic book series and directed by Matthew Vaughn in the same pop and exaggerated style as his previous ""Kick-Ass,"" before taking a difficult turn in a decidedly classified territory.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This film was funny and action packed,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is a British secret agent film that calls back to the old spy films, especially the James Bond series of films. There is a lot of fun to be had in this film. The acting is great all around, even the small characters that only have a minute or so of screen time are up to par. In terms of the plot there are very few issue I had with it. The training segment was cool but there was almost no training shown on screen, just tests that took place between the training. This made it kind of jarring to see a people gain tremendous skill so fast. The music is fun and fits extremely well into the fun, over the top action scenes. This whole movie is very self-aware about how over the top it is. There are many times in the story where characters will reference old spy movies and bring up how clichéd their current situations are. The dialogue is very witty so most conversations are very interesting to listen to. There are many interesting and unique characters that I loved watching interact with each other. Some of the accents can be a little thick so I may take a little time to get used to. The action is not to be taken seriously. If you've seen the trailer you know what I am talking about. People will be hit in the face and flip a couple of times before hitting the ground. This is definitely a positive; the film definitely gained a lot from that. The villain's motivation is kind of dumb, but you can get into it because of the self-awareness of the movie. The action scenes are phenomenal. While they can be a little shaky, you can definitely see the immense skill that went into them. The editing of the action is very original and blew my mind. Be warned that this movie definitely earned that R rating. This is the source one of two real negatives with the movie. The language is just filthy but does not feel like it had to be. I am perfectly fine with some F words during action scenes. I'm sure that if I was fighting for my life I would curse, too. The problem is that people cursed constantly, even if it wasn't necessary. It didn't feel natural when people would curse about small, irrelevant things. If you want an example of a movie that utilizes cursing is a realistic way, then watch the movie Chef, or V for Vendetta. I typically don't care too much about this but there was so much cursing in inappropriate places that it began to bother me. The gore on the other hand was fine. Yes, it was pretty gross and shocking, but the film did it rarely enough and never lingered on it for long enough to really bother me. There was a very unnecessary (and very brief) nudity scene at the tail end of the film designed to be funny, but just came of as awkward. My final complaint is rather small but there is one product placement for McDonalds that was so obvious and in your face that it took me out of the scene for a while. Be sure to stay for about minute after the credits roll because there is a little scene that concludes a somewhat important arc.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fun at the end but drags on in the beginning,The first hour I was checking the time to see how much longer I have.

A bloody good time!,"Last night i saw a press screening of Kingsman: the secret service and wow was i blown away! Another great night at the movies. I wasn't too sure what the movie would be about as i had only seen the trailer 2 times and i believe they were different trailers so it was the second one that sold me on the movie. The Action set pieces are very well done and it feels like a hybrid of James Bond, Sherlock Holmes, and John Wick. The movie is very self aware and doesn't take itself too seriously which is always nice :) the world that has been set up in this film really requires a sequel to explore it further however the movie wraps up as its own stand alone movie 1 minutes into the credits with the last scene. so if there is no sequel the movie will still be fantastic, but spending more time in that world will be fun! Now some of the jokes/humor was lost upon me because i speak/ have an ear for British insults/jokes but you noticed that it was a joke being made so still laughed along with the others in the theater. The movie has a lot more heart than i thought yet the comedy overpowers this Action Spy Film. See this movie and appreciate original films like this!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"some great action scenes and acting by all the main players, but Samuel L Jackson's character was so off-putting and the dramatic elements seemed out of place","I saw this reluctantly after so many years and admittedly I was surprised at the action scenes, they were brilliantly executed although the church one felt too long, it eventually became nauseating. Stunt choreography and acting combined was impressive, Taron Egerton was unexpectedly captivating in his performance; Colin Firth unsurprisingly great, Mark Strong I honestly was hoping to see more of, and for what little there was of Mark Hamill, he too was entertaining. Perhaps my biggest praise for the movie was it leaning into the R rating; for the type of movie it is, I'm shocked they even went for R. The frequent profanity never felt forced and the blood, although lamely CGI'd, was appreciated. Of course, the whole stereotypical villain plot of world domination via some insane ploy was cringe, but I guess that's what they were shooting for. Unfortunately, given the prevalence of humor, or at least the outrageousness of the plot and Samuel L Jackson's annoyingly silly character, I couldn't take any of the dramatic moments seriously. Still, entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Spy New School Awesomenss,"Kingsman The Secret Service is a fantastic spy thriller that has a lot of heart and is very funny. The direction from Matthew Vaughn is dynamic, using steady and shaky cam as well as they possible can be used and not relying on 30 cuts every 5 seconds during the fights. The acting is great, from Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson to newcomer Taron Egerton and Vaughn regulars like Mark Strong and a nice smaller role from Mark Hamill, everyone is on their game and fits flawlessly into their roles. The story is smart, fun and easy to follow and the musical score fits to a T.

Kingsman embraces its Bond influence- transcends its genre,"Kingsman starts out like a fairly normal spy movie. In fact, almost routine-like. I started to have fears of director Matthew Vaughn's impressive action credentials being confined only within the X-men universe. But as the standard bond plot goes on; the more insane and crazy the action became.Statements were being made about the idea of violence- how much is too much- should we identify with our heroes reacting to violence with little to no emotion (if not sadistically enjoying it); and at the same time Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman were reveling in not only the crazy violence displayed on screen, but the potential reactions of the audiences.I saw one trailer of this marketed like a spy-version of one of the Young Adult novels; and the thought of teens expecting Stormbreaker 2 when watching this made me side with Vaughn and co. This is a film that embraces the bond tropes so hard that they almost burst. And that is a great thing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"An enjoyable, fun romp","Kings man is such a great joy to experience because it plays a interesting, satisfying trope- that of the cultured, suave spy. It is obviously a bond-Esque film, but directed and written with such assured hands as to render it engaging and entertaining throughout(which cannot be said for all bond films). The film is also fun because it has excellent action choreography, unrealistic yes, but excellently over the top and satisfyingly brutal. In this movie, one man can fight a hundred, often quite literally, as shown in a glorious church scene where our man ends up the last man standing in a church riot. Although the plot is quite fantastical, the film still manages to retain an audiences attention because it is tautly paced and well acted, especially the performances of Eggert and Firth.

"A 2 hour commercial for Levi's, McDonald's, The Sun, Guinness, etc","This is a fun action movie in the 'Bond on speed' style. Acting is good, story is OK for the genre and the fight scenes are top shelf. But we aren't even 30 seconds in before the first thug pulls out a gun from his pants, with the resulting zoom on a Levi's pocket for a good 3 seconds. The bar is set for the rest of the movie, where the main characters make sure to announce they are enjoying their Guinness at the pub and have front pages from The Sun plastered all over their office (despite playing an intellectual liberal who likely doesn't share a single perspective on anything with that newspaper). Product placement is fine when it is suble, but The Kingsman it is a constant barrage of in-your-face product references.

Entertaining spy film for the next generation,"Clearly, Kingsman was crafted because of the sheer love Vaughn has for the old spy movies like the sixties Bonds.

What Vaugh has done, is take that great escapist spy formula from those days (when Bond films weren't gritty and down to earth) and updated it for a modern audience. The succes is a highly entertaining film with standout performances all around, but the highest praise must go to newcomer Egerton as Eggsy. He absolute steals each scene, no easy task considering he was up against guys like Jackson, Firth, Strong and Caine.

A Terrific Blockbuster Sometimes Marred By Its Violence,"It's hard not to miss the early days of James Bond, when the adventures were colorful, 007 was spryly unserious, and the villains were ready to rupture with their European shaded, cackling madmen personas. Such wondrous cool exploded in the early Bond franchise that it isn't unrealistic to watch ""Goldfinger"" over and over again. Cheekiness goes a long way. But now we have the ""modern"" Bond (introduced in 2006's ""Casino Royale""), who is as sophisticated as ever but is hardly the Technicolor nympho he was in the pre-Brosnan days. He's become a spy grizzled and cynical, more quick to grimace as he goes through the motions, a smirk completely unheard of. I like ""Casino Royale"" and its sequels (""Quantum of Solace"", ""Skyfall""), but I miss the days when British spies weren't always well-oiled machines of slickness — agile, action-packed ridiculousness is much more satisfactory in the long run.I suppose I wasn't sitting around and waiting for a movie like ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" to come around and sweep me off my feet, but it's the kind of blockbuster needed to invigorate the incessant rut of superhero franchises/gritty action movies. Here is a movie so cartoonishly brash in its thrills I couldn't help but reflect back on ""The Avengers"" and ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."". Cheesy yet impressively tactical, both were 1960s spy shows fully aware they were telling comically insane stories most of the time — but through a competent use of gaudy violence and disco ball flashy characters, silliness became sly while everyones tongue remained firmly in cheek.""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a parody of sorts, self-aware in its cocktail infused kookiness but ready to pay homage when it comes time to hearken back to the days when Roger Moore was kicking every bad guy's ass as he held an unrealistically sexy woman at close quarters. This film's biggest issue is its violence — while oft comical, there are several gratuitous scenes of bloodshed that hardly match the snickering tone of everything else — but when ""Kingsman"" succeeds it manages to soar; it's a puff of crisp air following the pollution of its staling super-suited counterparts.With a lively wicked performance from Jackson, ""Kingsman"", like one of its characters suggests, is as good as its villain: exaggerated, bombastic, agreeably oily, though a little too violent. Indeed, the majority of ""Kingsman"" is an amusing take on what the Bond franchise could have been, had 007 been seventeen and let loose in a maze of rated-R obstacles — but sometimes, the film goes too far, a shame when so much of it sits a cut above other modern blockbusters.My most prominent issue lies in the constant profanity and the sometimes disturbing violence. Though I don't liken myself to the most prudish of people, tonal issues arise through ""Kingsman""'s inability to figure out if it's joking or if it's a bit sick in the head. The fight scenes are astonishingly well-choreographed, haphazardly exciting in their fast-motion dexterity — but somewhere during the halfway mark, the film sours once it sets a mass slaughter in a church.The scene, finding its setting in Kentucky, serves as an introduction to Valentine's new technology, which causes even the most peaceful of people to become violent with just the click of a button, thanks to their Valentine designed cell phones. Unfortunately, Harry Hart is visiting, ending with him killing every single person in the building. Vaughn, who directs most of the film charismatically, decides that such an act is excusable as long as the people are despicable (think the Westboro Baptist Church) — but the murders are less cutely ""Kill Bill"" and more gory horror movie violent, the acts mostly shocking and not thrilling. The scene ends with a man getting a stake stabbed harshly from the bottom of his face to the top: are we supposed to laugh? Irritating is how much more focus is put into these scenes of gratuitous terror being placed upon innocents while the post-credits sequence leaves Eggsy's beating of his stepfather off-camera. Personally, I would rather my screen violence be justified rather than simply there to be cool. But that's just me.If my review sounds negative, don't pay any attention: the previous two paragraphs exist as one giant complaint. Fact is, I liked ""Kingsman: The Secret Service."" Taron Egerton, reminiscent of a snarky young Guy Pearce, has serious potential to become a movie star. You certainly won't look at the normally smooth Colin Firth the same way again. And Vaughn (""Kick Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class""), for the most part, gives us a strictly fun action movie, full of terrific lines and thrillingly choreographed brawls. I just wish the film had an understanding that violence has to match tone, and for a movie so ready to charm us, we shouldn't have to buckle up and grab our barf bags right after we gleam during a witty exchange.

Everyone involved is endlessly watchable, even those with smaller parts. Newcomer Taron Egerton was very good as both the street-wise punk with an oddly sophisticated past, and the dapper Kingsman he eventually becomes. The action and effects were well done, although some may find a certain choice near the end to be a bit odd.

Feeling guilt over the loss of his comrade, Harry Hart, code-named ""Galahad,"" personally delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow, Michelle Unwin, and his young son, Gary ""Eggsy"", saying that if they ever need help, they should call the phone number on the back of the medal and deliver a coded message.Seventeen years later, Professor James Arnold is kidnapped by unknown assailants, led by Internet billionaire Richmond Valentine and his henchwoman Gazelle. One of Hart's compatriots, ""Lancelot,"" attempts to stage a rescue, but fails. Valentine, known for his philanthropy, continues to meet with various heads of state and VIPs; some of whom go missing afterwards. He also announces a giveaway of SIM cards, granting free cellular and Internet access.In London, Eggsy is now an unemployed young adult living with his mother, infant half-sister, and abusive stepfather Dean. Despite being intelligent and capable, he left training for the Royal Marines and lives an aimless life. After being arrested for stealing a car and taking it for a joyride, Eggsy calls the number on the back of the medal. Hart arranges for his release and tells Eggsy about the existence of Kingsman, a secret intelligence agency for which both he and Eggsy's late father worked. In the wake of Lancelot's death, the agency opens a vacancy for a new agent, and Eggsy agrees to apply. He joins a group of other candidates, including a woman named Roxy. Training is overseen by ""Merlin,"" a senior Kingsman that acts as teacher, quartermaster, pilot and Ops coordinator. The candidates are eliminated one by one until Eggsy and Roxy emerge as the final two. However, Eggsy fails his final test, and Roxy becomes the new Lancelot.During this time, Kingsman have been investigating Valentine in connection with the VIP disappearances and notes that Arnold is no longer missing. Hart tracks down Arnold and confronts him about his abduction. A chip implanted in Arnold's head explodes, killing him; Hart is injured during his escape from unknown assailants. Undeterred, Hart poses as a billionaire and dines with Valentine to try to discern his plans.Hart tracks Valentine to an obscure hate group church in Kentucky, where Valentine and Gazelle are conducting a test. They broadcast a signal to his SIM cards, causing everyone in the church, including Hart, to become uncontrollably violent. A mass brawl breaks out, with Hart the sole survivor, while Eggsy, Merlin and Arthur—the Kingsman's leader—watch via video link. Valentine approaches Hart and kills him without revealing his plan.Eggsy returns to the Kingsman headquarters, where he discovers that Arthur is one of Valentine's converts. Arthur explains Valentine's views: humanity is akin to a virus, and global warming is the Earth's equivalent of a fever. Valentine intends to kill the virus before it kills the host, broadcasting his signal worldwide to cause a massive culling of the human race. Only a select few that Valentine has deemed worthy of living — those who have sided with him and thus received the protective microchips in their heads, and the VIPs he kidnapped — will be spared.After avoiding Arthur's attempt to kill him — killing the group leader as he does so — Eggsy teams up with Roxy and Merlin. Roxy pilots a high-altitude balloon vehicle into the stratosphere to disrupt Valentine's satellite network with a missile, while Eggsy and Merlin directly assault Valentine's mountain bunker. Roxy knocks out the satellite and Eggsy fights his way through Valentine's security forces, while Merlin detonates the security chips, killing all who were part of Valentine's plan. Eggsy then fights and defeats Gazelle before killing Valentine and saving the world.In a mid-credits scene, Eggsy, now a full Kingsman, reaches out to his mother, offering her a nicer house and a chance to get away from Dean.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
My Life is Worse after Seeing this Movie,"The best thing about this film was the time before I ever watched in when with a naive child-like faith I believed that there was still the possibility of an action film that didn't make me wish I could go back in time and slap myself in the face to avoid watching this truly horrible film.At first I thought I could attempt to overlook the totally idiotic and unnecessary profanity in hopes that the action scenes and over all plot would make it worth while. But after a while (and by ""a while"" I mean the first 10 minutes) it just seems like a bunch of prepubescent children were given permission to swear like the big kids, and for no apparent reason are running around screaming the f word.A man sliced cleanly in half in the first scene should have given me a fair warning. The violence wasn't laughable or gruesome or realistic. It was stupid. I've seen episodes of sponge bob square pants where poorly sketched characters slap each other that had more of a positive effect on me than this did.Even the overall plot was dull and predictable.I don't know what sort of blackmail was used on some of these great actors to get them to agree to this truly pathetic production. I feel certain it was created for idiots by idiots.If you want to watch a truly horrible movie in every way, this one is for you.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Better than I expected,"At the start, I though the movie is just an ordinary teenager movie where the hero is a school student that is a spy and his mission is to find some Latino drug dealers and put them to the jail.But when I watched it, I was like: ""Damn, that is a hot sexy movie"". The spy girl that went out to the moon is hot as hell too. His mom played nice role.What I hated about the movie is that the music background didn't fit most of the themes. You should have choose better EDM songs. But anyway the movie isn't about music or soundtracks. Great job all the way to be honest guys.The second thing that I hated is the Arthur (the head of the kingsman), is always playing the good roles not the bad guys side.The scenario is outstanding alongside the actors and their acting abilities.Perfect movie all the way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I loved it.,"My son reckoned I wouldn't like this movie, but I did and would have watched it a second time but fell asleep. Action plus, great cast, special effects and as the director mentioned, one has to have a nasty villain that made the 007 movies so great.I don't know if they can follow it up with a second sequel but they will have to follow it up with a great cast someone to replace Arthur (Michael Caine) and Colin Firth (Gallahad).I thought the script and editing were brilliant, it brought smiles too my face, especially the ending. ""Good manners maketh the man"". It does, even though he might be a dangerous person inwardly if one crossed him badly. In other words, he or she, doesn't wear their heart on their sleeve and only attacks the unworthy.I loved the approach and theme, and hope they dare to make a sequel that would also get a 10 out of 10. To coin a phrase, it will be a hard act to follow, but well done. About time the great spy movies got some humour in them, as they are what we would like reality to be, but unfortunately it isn't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A really cool action movie,"This is awesomeness redefined. Every time I believe the world has seen enough action movies, I get jolted off my senses to accept that there exists million other exciting ways to kick, jump and fight. And when violence combines with humor and Lynyrd Skynyrd solo, the jolt is even more devastating. Kingsman, the secret services, as the title suggests is an undercover organization 'tailored' to protect the world from unprecedented dangers which threaten mankind. Its members are the world's most agile, skilled, intelligent, suited and British gentlemen with a penchant for vintage whiskey and cute dogs. The movie covers basically two issues. One is to find an ideal replacement of one of the most able members of the service. The screening process is one of a kind, I have ever seen. It's wonderfully conceptualized, pulsating and unpredictable. The other issue is to avert a massive catastrophe which I cannot comprehend at all until the last quarter of the movie. This certainly forced me to speculate and commanded focused attention throughout the movie. Among the characters, the first pick is of course Colin Firth. Very few can portray the grace of a king and valor of a knight as convincingly as he did. At the helm, the think tank is always Michael Caine who exudes the persona of a wise old man who stands firm on his beliefs and ideals- either for good or bad; we have to decide. 'Taron Egerton' is one of the most able contenders for being a Kingsman but disappoints a little when he actually is. All in all, the movie is a must watch. A real refreshment for the ones who are actually bored of typical action movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A violent, funny and exciting action thriller for adults","Kingsman: Secret Service is fantastic, it just delivers a lot of thrills and violence that it is nearly unbelievable, this film is one of the best of 2015. I saw this the first time when i was on a plane, i saw the airline version.The plot is about how a promising street kid whose mom is poor with an abusive father and a baby, joins the Kingsman to stop a Tech genius from using a Sim-card, which allows free-internet to cause people to go insane and go on a murderous rampage, it's up to Eggsy, the street kid to stop him and his assistant from releasing the Sim-card to the public.The film is very good, so good in fact, it's much better than any other Matthew Vaughn Movie before that. The script in this Movie is both funny and well written, while the performances are top notch, the film just falls flat when compared to it's likable characters, most of the characters are good, but some can be forgotten.The violence is good, but there's just too much of it, it's like Kick-Ass just not as realistic. The shout-out for the film is of course Colin Firth, he is fantastic, he delivers the lines perfectly. The film is also funny, some scenes made me laugh like the part where Galahad said he was a Catholic whore and where the dinner at the Meeting with the villain was McDonalds Food.The Church scene is if not the most violent scene i've seen in a action-comedy, this seen includes every single ways to die as possible, impalement, shooting, getting fire in the hair, Axe and stabbing.When i saw the trailer for this Movie, i didn't expect it to be that violent, literally. When i saw the trailer, i thought it was a PG-13 Movie, but i was wrong, it's violent, rude and has sexual References.Kingsman: Secret Service is a fantastic film, the Music, action scenes, script, acting, characters and plot is great, despite the violence being a bit much innit (pun intended) and a few character Development issues, otherwise great Movie, recommended for the People who are sensitive.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Really entertaining!,"Kingsman is a fantastic film, fast paced, funny, and serious in the same instance.Colin Firth as the ""mentor"" to the main character was awesome, far different from the usual type of character he plays; sophisticated and cool.Taron Egerton (who plays the lead - ""eggsy"") Filled the role perfectly, his character being a ""chav"" with an high IQ and natural athleticism, has fallen 'off the rails' and finds himself in trouble with the law (before he knew about Kingsman, that is).Every other character was played well, with a list of great actors including Samuel L Jackson (as the super villain), and Michael Cane.Overall a very good film, exceeded already high expectations.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Review of Kingsman,"Please indulge my need to object the rating of ""Kingsman"".My Objections to the movie:1. The use of the word f***. It seemed to be on a marathon of how many times can they get that disgusting word into the time frame. It simply didn't let up! 2. It seems to promote the idea that all difficulties or challenges require a good drink of a quality liquor. Not what we want to promote with our 14 year old. 3. Success, promotes the idea that blatant sex is the reward. Come on with a 14 year old rating?This movie draws the young generation. The content is disgusting language and inappropriate behavior. I am angry and willing to carry my complaint to anyone who will listen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
What a charming movie!,"After ages I saw a good Action/Thriller/Comedy movie. How many times you watch a movie and say 'great action! but could have had a little more comic scenes' or 'all action but where is the story?' but with Kingsman you get a package deal.There is a secret service/intelligence agency called Kingsman which is ""very secret"" as Michael Cane says and its working domain is international. This time they loose one of the kingsman and want to find a good fit for it. That's where the real story starts.In one of the initial fighting scene in the movie you can find out which kind of the movie it would be. This scene has a little humor, sleek action and a kick-ass/funny introduction of the Villain.The story is very simple and nothing new in that and it would have been a very ordinary movie in any other director's hand but Matthew Vaughn makes it stylish and irresistible!The Action scenes are of course the highlight of the movie but everything else shines out as well. The dialogues, the costumes, the swag, setup everything.Performance wise everyone has done a great job but Colin Firth has acted marvelously and he has taken the movie to whole another level. His dialogues delivery is excellent, his fight sequences will certainly shock you in a positive sense and most importantly his chemistry with Taron Egerton is awesome. Specially the church fighting sequence will blow your mind.Samual L. Jackson as a Villain has enjoyed most in this role. You can clearly see that he is very comfortable in this character who has a slight lisp (and you will love it) and a fear from gore/bloody sights and yet he is the one responsible for all the blood and gore in the movie! He has a very likable personality as a Villain and never forgets to be a funny but dangerous antagonist.The training of new Kingsman part could have had a few more scenes as you would enjoy them.Taron Egerton is good as Eggsy and has some good action sequences in the movie.Overall a great action movie which I would love to watch again because ""A gentleman never ceases to appreciate a good movie"" :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A Brilliant Revival of the Original Bond Format on Steroids!,"After the success of Kick-Ass and X-Men First Class you would expect something special from director Matthew Vaughn; Kingsman: The Secret Service will blow your expectations to smithereens. This ultra-violent, super-charged reboot of the spy genre may be the most exhilarating blockbuster of the year. A gloriously bold venture, Kingsman furiously pushes the limits of mainstream cinema to bring you exactly what you never knew you wanted.Colin Firth revels in the role of suave spy Harry Hart, who introduces us to elite super-secret organization, Kingsman. Hart recruits Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), the least likely candidate, to join Kingsman's grueling eliminatory training process designed to test his mettle and loyalty. Relative newcomer Egerton displays impeccable talent as the rough-around-the- edges Eggsy, commandeering every scene with utter charm.While Eggsy overcomes each challenge in this particularly unorthodox program, callous tech mogul Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) plots a global revolution of catastrophic proportions. Jackson is emphatic as the sadistic and flamboyant super-villain, Valentine who ironically cannot stand the sight of blood. Fortunately, a sexy sidekick with some killer blades is on hand to carry out his dirty work. Jackson's chemistry with Firth is particularly electric in an excellent postmodern scene, which sees the foes discuss their preferences in spy movies.Brimming with crisp aesthetic and vibrant style, Kingsman displays high value and sophistication. The fight scene choreography hits every mark flawlessly, allowing the effervescent action to flow in a way only Vaughn can capture. The Kingsman agents manage to fight off mobs of mindless killers in marvelous locations without acquiring a sole crinkle to their immaculately tailored suits. An excellent soundtrack by Henry Jackman is teamed with fast paced, well-timed rhythm that barely allows you to catch your breath. Kingsman brings the fun back to spy movies with this hilariously irreverent and brazen proof that the concept never got old, but was rather in dire need of some fresh and innovative oomph.Kingsman is not without fault, the gratuitous violence can become a tad tedious, but the sheer audacity to the step away from the watered down action to which we have grown accustomed is precisely what makes Kingsman special. An attempt to present a strong female character in Roxy (Sophie Cookson) is also admirable, but falls short when she constantly achieves by chance rather than skill. Unfortunately Roxy is left merely to overcome her fear of heights while the boys save the world. With Hit-Girl for comparison, Vaughn certainly could have done better here.A brilliant revival of the original Bond format on steroids, Kingsman brings street to the elite with surprisingly hilarious consequences. With a wealth of talent that also includes Michael Caine and Mark Strong this British bombshell is cinematic gold. It even carries the solid message that anyone has the potential to be a gentleman; it is all about what you project and how you carry yourself, after all, ""manners maketh man"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Zealousness best served unrestricted,"I remember the very first trailer for ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" almost a year ago being rather unremarkable in the way it portrayed the action and spy genre, sort of seeing it as a spy film playing safe and not giving it much thought. However, when a release date of October 2014 was pushed back to February 2015, and the trailers began to become more prolific, it seemed that the marketing team behind the film started to deal with the film in an entirely new sense. The trailers became a riot, showing so much craziness and complete insanity that one wondered what would be left to show in the actual film. I went from a generally dismissive attitude to genuinely being excited for, what I saw, a something totally new and fresh.""Kingsman"" is exactly that; a film that slaughters convention and any and all expectations to create something completely unpredictable, zealous, and most importantly, highly enjoyable. The film opens by showing a mission in the Middle East, carried out by the honorable Kingsman, an elite spy organization. We see a Secret Agent by the name of Harry Hart (Colin Firth) try his best but fail to save the life of one of his fellow agents, leading him to deliver a medal of bravery to the man's widow and young son. He tells the song, Eggsy, that if they ever need any assistance to call the phone number on the back of the medal and state a special message.Seventeen years later, another Kingsman has fallen, leaving the organization questioning how to proceed against Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a wealthy inventor who is dolling out free cell phone service in efforts to control the population and his henchman Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), equipped with sharp metal legs. Eggsy lives in London with his mother and abusive stepfather, and is arrested after stealing a thug's car at a local pub with some friends. He uses his sole phone call in prison to call the number on the back of the medal given to him as a child, and is bailed out by Harry, who wants him recruited for the secret service agency known as Kingsman in efforts to stop Valentine and company.The Kingsmen use a variety of sophisticated weaponry and fighting styles that would normally leave the untrained aggressor crippled and sore for weeks. Harry, however, is not an untrained aggressor, using suave tactics to brutalize his enemies or instigators and assure that justice be served in a fair manner. He takes Eggsy as his prodigy, showing him the ropes of a Kingsman and what it means to work for the organization, as it's more than just umbrella guns, knives that propel out of dress shoes, and inconspicuous grenades.Obviously, ""Kingsman"" is a blatant parody of the Bond franchise, but it is so in the best possible manner. Rather than lazily parodying character names, mannerisms, and proposing direct references to films of the franchise, writers Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughn (""X-Men: First Class"") lampoon style, which will always bear a greater longevity than mindless name-calling and spoofing in parodies. The key to the art of parody is in style and convention, which Goldman and Vaughn understand from the get-go. What results is an uproariously fun film that never runs out of energy and always provides something fresh in a currently overcrowded pool.""Kingsman"" wisely comes amidst a time where the superhero genre and the spy/espionage genre are in their primes, but never adhering too much to one particular side, creating a joyful hybrid rather than yet another project to get lost in a sea of others. In what looks to be a big year for the superhero/action genre, ""Kingsman"" provides those experiencing fatigue and dissatisfaction from the ubiquity of such projects with a pleasant sense of originality and style to their content that could've easily been just another example of muchness in a genre.The film is likely to play nicely, with generally little competition in the same vein and an obvious push with communities like Reddit and 4chan embracing the content for its simultaneous slickness and uniqueness. Moreover, the film plays nicely for people simply looking for a cinematic experience that appears to have a pulse after a month of general ho-hum and mediocre releases. There's an unabashed level of excitement the film bears during a time of unimpressive titles that will undoubtedly find ways to cheer up a crowd that has long been done a disservice so far this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This film brought absolutely nothing new to the table.The volume of action was great but it was executed very poorly. It was a CGI fest throughout and it was unconvincing at best. The acting was subpar. SLJ was an embarrassment. It was the type of performance you would see in a not so serious commercial. Taron played the typical chav role pretty well. He looked the part at least.The whole thing was just too cheesy for me and very predictable. There were too many scenes where I actually found myself cringing. I recently watched John Wick and in comparison is light years beyond this film in regards to action. This film is for school kids that enjoy sniggering to a sexual reference, rubbish acting and all out action.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone because I'd be robbing them of their time.

"Thin but Electrifying, It's Best Enjoyed with a Healthy Appreciation for Old Bond Movies","Roaring, overly indulgent fun amidst the rubble of the classic spy films and programs that dominated the 1960s. It's a more deadpan, action-focused take than Austin Powers, of course, but I'd hardly venture to call it serious. The tone is decidedly carefree, which should be no surprise given the creative team's track record. Director Matthew Vaughan and comic book author Mark Millar, who teamed to bring Kick-Ass to the screen a few years ago, are also the guilty parties in this case, and it's right in the same ballpark. Tons of effective punchlines, a few really great cornerstone action sets, and a wide spectrum of colors to cover for a very simple, shallow, recycled plot. And it works, honestly, both as a standalone mind-number and as a winking, grinning, elbowing satire of Bond and company. For my money it lingers too long in the training room, but once the cast graduates it's basically balls-to-the-wall the rest of the way home. Gratifying if not nourishing, like the big McDonald's spread enjoyed by a certain nameless character in a key scene, I had a great time but felt a little guilty about it later. The chapel brawl and the series of colorful explosions at the film's climax are two spots I'll have a hard time forgetting, though, and I feel like I'm richer for having experienced them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Everything that's missing in a Bond movie ...,"I am offering you the opportunity to become a Kingsman. A tailor? A Kingsman agent. Like a spy? Of sorts. Interested? You think I've got anything to lose?I'm not a big fan of Bond films. Too clean, too boring and too stiff. And there was always Q who came up with some new inventions and coincidentally they came in handy in that movie. I would love to own his crystal ball. Also, every movie was stuffed with action, but you'd never see a speck of blood (Before all Bond fans react furiously: I admit that I haven't seen all Bond-movies. So I could be wrong on that part). And in every film a bunch of gorgeous ladies paraded around, but I've never seen a millimeter of offensive nudity. ""Kingsman : The Secret Service"" feels like a James Bond flick, but then provided with all these last-mentioned facts and an excessive dose of humor.Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is a member of ""The Kingsmen"", an espionage organization, which is even more secret than the secret service itself, that gets all the dirty jobs from MI6. Hart is a genuine Englishman and looks more like a distinguished businessman or banker than a master spy. During an operation in the Middle East, the father of Gary ""Eggsy"" (Taron Egerton) got killed, after which Hart gives this toddler a medal that could be useful in the future. 17 years later, during the kidnapping of a professor by the multi millionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), another secret agent is killed during the rescue operation. Hart recommends Eggsy (grown up, unemployed and no prospects) as a candidate to join ""The Kingsmen "".The whole film has the atmosphere of an old spy movie like James Bond or ""The Avengers"", a popular series from the 70's with John Steed as a secret agent who faithfully wore a bowler and was equipped with an ordinary umbrella with all sorts of ingenious gadgetry. Compared with the civilized manners in those days, ""Kingsman"" is rather brutal and radical. Don't get me wrong. Hart is an example of courtesy and attempts to be as reserved and correct as possible, regardless of the situation he finds himself in, as befits a true Brit. But it's mainly the dissolute tone and graphic violence that makes the difference. The film sometimes tends to take on Tarantino-like proportions. The fragment in the local church is such an example. 3 Minutes of rage swirling across your screen with Hart acting as a purebred John Wick. Or the scene in the local pub where he demonstrates equivalent fighting techniques as ""The Equalizer"". Colin Firth doesn't look particularly like a well-oiled fighting machine and some movements look rigid, but all in all this 55-year was convincing enough. He proves that besides serious roles full of drama as in ""Devil's Knot"" and ""The Railway Man"", he's capable to handle lighthearted, action-packed roles as well.When Eggsy begins the grueling training, with annoying rich kids as opponents, I was afraid it would lead to a kind of ""Ender's Game"" or ""Divergent"" story. Fortunately, this wasn't the case. The whole training proceeded under the watchful eye of Merlin (Mark Strong). The only thing that was a bit unbelievable for me, was the fact that an inexperienced teenager as Eggsy, whose most exciting life experience so far was peeing against an electric cattle fence, can grow out into an experienced parachutist in such short period. However I tolerated this since this action comedy doesn't take itself seriously in the first place. And also lets mention Michael Caine, as the Godfather of all Kingsmen, who perfectly took upon himself the role of ancien.In a real spy movie, a bad guy shouldn't be missing obviously. This part was played with visible pleasure by Samuel L. Jackson as the lisping multimillionaire Richmond Valentine who worries about the future of the earth. In particular, the global warming, concerns him. For this, however, he has devised a diabolical plan. Only the implementation of this plan is inadequate. Jackson is peerless in this role (About time after a few feeble performances) as the eccentric Valentine who can't stand seeing a drop of blood and tends to lose consciousness in that case. To avoid this, he has a graceful assistant called Gazelle (Sofia Boutella). A true fury and fighting machine with razor-sharp legs with the necessary amputated limbs as a result. Finally, also a honorable mention for Hanna Alström as the Swedish princess. She didn't need much acting talent, but her graceful butt was prominently displayed in the end.""Kingsman: The secret service"" is a must see movie. Do you enjoy a touch of dry English humor, overly bloody action moments and all of this with a wink to the great spy movies of yesteryear ? Surely this film is made for you. Brace yourself for this espionage which contains brute force as well as humor. And it doesn't avoid well known clichés, but still brings them in a different way so that you actually won't notice it really.

The films perfect blend of witty comedy and over the top action makes for a movie that rivals the forefathers of the spy genre.I have never really been a fan of action or spy movies, as I found that they have become stale over the years with a recycled plot line (with Skyfall being my only exception). However, Matthew Vaughn has managed to make something truly amazing rise from the ashes of the action genre. This is an epic movie filled with ultra-violence; laugh out loud moments and a strong and coherent plot, thus paving the way for this to be an inevitable success. As some of the other reviewers have put it, this is what would happen if Kick-Ass and James Bond made sweet love and created the ultimate spy action movie.It contains all the same nuance's that you would expect from a British spy movie, with the elegant spoken word and the dapper costumes and suits. But it is all built around the framework of over the top violence that will make even the strong willed wince in pain. The best way to describe it is, this is an action movie that understands it's an action movie, Vaughn hasn't tried to water it down to make it more 'child friendly' if anything he has turned the dial up and chucked in as much violence and foul-mouthed comedy as he could get away with (however I must stress that it is just enough to carry the film and its brilliant plot, and it isn't just violence for the sake of it)But I would say the number one thing that kept this film fresh and entertaining was the undeniably awesome cast consisting of heavy hitters like Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson mixed with up and coming stars like Taron Egerton and Sophie Cookson. For me, Colin Firth stole the show as the suave super spy with the ability to kill you with his pinkie finger – because we are so used to seeing him play roles that require such seriousness, it was refreshing and fun to see him out of his comfort zone and play a more dynamic character. Whilst talking about cast, it's only right that I mention that Sam Jackson delivers another sterling performance with a character I promise you weren't expecting, but also Taron shows that he is well on his way to stardom and that he has a range that his acting chops are developing very nicely.All in all, the breath-taking cinematography and witty script backed by an impeccable cast means that Kingsman: The Secret Service is one of the best films I have ever witnessed. It is original and cool, but most of all it doesn't require much thinking on your part. So you can sit back, relax and enjoy the epic story as it unfolds before you.P.S. If it is a decision between Fifty Shades of Grey and this masterpiece, I urge you wholeheartedly to make Kingsman your choice as I promise you, you will not be disappointed. 10/10 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Witty and Bond-like with a touch of British humour,"Kingsman: The secret service is one of the few movies which can make the viewer laugh even though there are brutal action scenes. It is the only movie where even genocide can seem humorous. It brings back the classic James Bond style and the concept of spy agents. Usage of futuristic gadgets, glamour, adventures including traversing the globe and of course, a lot of action-packed sequences. The music which is integrated with certain scenes is brilliant and the screenplay is beyond ordinary. I may be biased towards British movies because anything British fascinates me.This movie is brilliantly made in terms of action and humour. Even though it has a cliché spy story, it is portrayed differently.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Bad,This film was bad. I can understand if you are between 12 - 15 yrs old you might like it but I find it instantly forgettable. I don't understand how it can get a 7.9 rating on IMDb...unless the majority of people voting are in that age group. This doesn't come close to films like Blade Runner ( 8.2 ) or Easy Rider ( 7.4 ) which have featured in the top 100 films of all time for the last 30 years yet receive a similar score....I think there is something fundamentally wrong with the rating system. Kingsman will have disappeared without a trace within a couple of weeks and not even make the top 1000... ever...so I can only assume that the rating will decline over time as people grow wiser with age or more film enthusiasts start voting.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Very entertaining,"Unexpectedly entertaining movie - honestly, I assumed this will be just another run-of-the- mill action boom-bang-a-bang but it turned out it was compulsive watching with lots of humor that affectionately pokes fun at James Bond. It has all the ingredients of usual clichés (elegant mentor leading young unknown and green talent trough procedures that would create another super-hero) and it works wonderfully as everybody obviously had lots of fun while making this, specially Colin Firth who for once steps out of the box where directors so often forced him to be just another romantic lover in historical costumes - you can clearly see his joy of being allowed to do something different and here, for a change he is a bad ass who fights, breaks bones left and right and all of this without ever losing his suave posture. His young protégé is Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who metamorphoses from poor London boy in sneakers into another elegant secret agent and has just the right charisma to carry on the rest of the movie. There are also obligatory celebrities (Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Caine) but honestly the movie would work with anybody in these roles. There is no point in taking this movie seriously and trying to find any deep meaning - critics are collectively praising it for being entertaining, funny, full of action and lots of car crashes so it is really a good, old fashioned cinematic action extravaganza that screams for sequels.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of the most fun theatre-going experiences I've had in recent memory,"The plot of ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" involves various agents of an international secret intelligence agency (The Kingsman) on a mission to take down an insane billionaire's plot of 'improving' the world. One of these agents is 'Eggsy' - a troubled young man who is given an opportunity, among stiff competition, to become a Kingsman.QUICK REVIEW: Matthew Vaughn steps it up again with Kingsman: The Secret Service. Yes, the humour and violence may seem immature and tasteless to some, but if you enjoy the kinds of humour and violence in movies made by Tarantino or even Edgar Wright, then this film is perfect for you (I personally love stylized violence myself). Most of the action scenes are done hand-held, but they're proficient enough so that you can see every punch, kick, and gunshot clearly.Expect to see one of this film's lead star, Taron Egerton, in a lot more films in the future. Not only did he get his character's tough exterior and quick wit down, but he also has his character's sweet and caring side down. The chemistry between him and Colin Firth's character is also strong.Speaking of Firth, he too proves himself as an actor who can take on physically demanding roles in this movie. I would even go as far as to say his performance is as suave as Sean Connery's when he's James Bond.Vaughn could not have picked a better actor to play the main villain of this movie. Samuel L. Jackson is as HILARIOUS as he is cold as billionaire Richmond Valentine.Fun, irreverent, and jam-packed with action, Kingsman: The Secret Service is one film you don't want to miss in 2015.VERDICT: See it in theatres... NOW.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Strong fight scenes make this film good,"Went in without any expectations or rather, expected it to be like those Hollywood teenage spy movies. What i got was truly unexpected.The combat scenes have a level of hardcore and speed that i normally only see in korean films (eg Man from nowhere). With a lot of Hollywood action films, fights are slow and cumbersome, while a fight in this film is at high speed signalling well practised choreography.The script is fine, with the various scenes that encourage rooting for the ""blue collar makes good"" are easy to spot but all the actors play their parts well, at the very least. Samuel L Jackson puts in a non standard performance while Colin Firth plays the cultured agent shtick with pizazz. Sofia Boutella makes an impression though sheer audacity and physicality, though at the end of the show i did not even remember her character's name (if it was given). Comedy is doled out in small doses and work well with the overall script.Not truly a 10/10 film but the show's fight scenes deserve the recognition.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Absolutely FUN! A Marriage of James Bond & Pulp Fiction,"With a movie of this quality, it is quite easy to set aside technical- physical impossibles and just settle in for the ride. It was so over the top funny that the technical goofs only made it more hilarious than not. The music was powerfully fun, the acting and Brit street lingo was great, and quite simply, I had to watch it several times because I kept recommending it to friends and family. It only slowed down--for me--during the last ""phase"" of 20% or so. The scene at the backward church in Kentucky was epic!Set in the UK's London, the street lingo the Brits (apparently) use was entertaining all by itself and I learned a few more expressions from our British friends. The two-finger'd ""flick-off"" the Brits use was also accurate--allegedly originating from the British Longbow shooters of the middle-ages who were so hated by their enemies, having their bow fingers cut off was just the beginning of their punishment if captured. I watched the film in the USA and in Italy, though the Italian audiences seemed more muted in their response, perhaps because the type of humor (guns, bombs, etc.) doesn't get them as much?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Assemble the kingsman,"A spy orginization recruits a young teenager into their ultra competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. first and foremost, I think this is better than the 007 series, this takes the spy genre, spins it on its head, goes completely nuts with it and says LET'S GO lol, and it doesn't tone anything down or hold back at all, it just goes full on crazy :-), and I liked how this was in the vein of kickass rather than 007. this movie was just absolute fun, if you loved the kickass series, you're gonna LOVE kingsman, it's loaded with really impressive action, blood and gore, and dry British humor that always makes you laugh out loud, and leave the kiddies at home for this one, this is for the adult crowd. I'm planning on seeing this again with my dad since he already wants to check it out lol",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
KINGSMAN is cinema royalty,"With ""KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE"", Matthew Vaughn secures his position as one of my five favorite directors. I've seen virtually all of Vaughn's previous films (""STARDUST"", ""KICK-A**"", and ""X-MEN: FIRST CLASS), but this one assures his place among one of Hollywood's best filmmakers. This high-tech espionage action-comedy-thriller has great acting, a highly involving story, and (best of all) over-the-top action and violence. I actually gave this film a standing ovation, and I don't give that to a lot of films I go see. I highly recommend ""KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE"". It delivers more than it promises, and it is one of the most entertaining films of this or any other year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Entertaining, Funny and Gripping Movie","A refreshing way of presenting spy movies with expensive gadgets and suits. The main difference compared to Bond or Bourne movies is the comic angle which very well suits the whole theme. I wish there were more romantic angle to the story and also I wanted to see more of the training that Kingsman go through so that they become so good. There is a good material for sequel I think. So this movie is more on entertainment side. They could have added more depth to the characters however that could have been challenging to do in a 2 hour movie. With sequels, the character exploration can be attempted to create a legendary Kingsman story itself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
First great movie of 2015,"Kingsman: The secret service is about Gary ""Eggsy""(Taron Egerton) who is a teenager who's gets in a lot of trouble but when Harry Hart(Colin Firth) has the chance to recruit someone to be a kingsman and chooses Eggsy because he see potential. The Kingsman is a spy organization. First off, thank you Matthew Vaughn for making this movie. I haven't had this much fun in a theater since Guardians of the Galaxy. Let's start with the acting, not one person was bad. Colin Firth plays his role as a spy so well. Samuel L. Jackson was great as the villain. One of the best and funniest villains in the past few years. Everyone did great but the person who stole the show, was newcomer Taron Egerton. This was his first film and wow, he can act. Hope to see him in more movies. There some cameos that just makes the movie more special. The action was amazing, the way Matthew Vaughn handles each action scene, just makes you wanting more and more. This was the first spy movie to add a little bit of every other spy movie and make it great and different at the same time. It's James Bond meets Austin Powers.Overall Kingsman: the secret service is a crazy, fun spy movie, that everyone should check out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"As stated by another review, Kingsman is 'bloody brilliant'. Do I agree...bloody yes!","A mind blowing spy action with a hint of British class that makes you proud to be British. Kingsman provides action, intensity, comedy, and fun for all viewers. If you think it is a simple spoof of all spy films, you could not be more wrong.Colin Firth provides that awesome, and fetching fighting skills, and character for viewers to support. Seen in continuous fight scenes, with sensational Cinematography, we meet the James Bond side of Firth with non-stop skills.Kingsman is definitely a 10/10, and must see film of 2015. Although the film contains constant bloody and graphic content throughout, I believe that Kingsman is film for the whole age appropriate family.This film is strongly recommended by this viewer so, grab your ticket and enjoy 2 hours of action packed thrills.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
more entertaining than the last half dozen Bonds combined,"I truly loved this movie. It rekindles the innovation, the excitement and the surreal tone that the last few 007 movies have been missing in spades.Acting is uniformly excellent, with the established names like Caine, Jackson, Firth and Strong as flawless as ever and newcomers like Egerton and Cookson skillfully more than holding their own in such stellar company.The action scenes are stunning, and unlike many recent action movies , you can actually see what is going on. Cinematography is superb, and the production values are first rate. The budget for Kingsman was a fraction of that of Quantum of Solace, and yet Kingsman looks much more polished.The score, by two gentlemen whose names I was unfamiliar with is evocative and memorable.In short I can't endorse this movie strongly enough.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Kick-Ass meets James Bond: Superbly Stylish and Highly Enjoyable,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is the latest hyper-violent offering from Layer Cake/Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn. Starring Colin Firth as highly gentlemanly secret agent Galahad, Kingsman tells the story of Eggsy, (exciting new-comer Taron Egerton) a chavvy London teenager who seems to be at a low point in his life, until he meets Galahad and discovers the Kingsman society, which includes Michael Caine and Mark Strong as members of the Secret Service. As Eggsy begins the process of joining Kingsman, he discovers the plot of human-hating Valentine (a lisping Samuel L. Jackson.)Now where Kingsman succeeds is perfectly blending elements of laugh-out-loud humour, nailed by the spot-on comic timing of Egerton and Firth, a subversive commentary on the spy genre (from the silliness of the 1960s to the Bourne-ification of the James Bond series) and very fun, extra stylish action sequences. Notably a stand-out sequence in a church full of racist Southerners, to the tune of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Free Bird,"" has viewers visibly grinning with delight as they watch the eye-catching, finely-staged action unfold. By making the characters and the ""gentleman"" ideals realistic, Vaughn creates a fine film in which you not only want to be the characters but also could be them. Unlike a certain 007, Galahad and the true Kingsmen represent the qualities of what a real, every-day gentleman, which is both riveting to follow and entertaining to watch.There is little bad to be said about Kingsman. I suppose if you hated Kick-Ass and dislike the spy genre in general, it is almost certainly not for you, but it is probably worth watching anyway. Also, once the main plot begins to get under way, it slows down for a while. Nothing major actually happens for a while, but it's still highly entertaining. Jackson, apparently doing his lisp on a whim, is just as interesting to watch as always, as is his ""legless"" sidekick Gazelle. Mark Hamill appears for a while, simply to prepare us for the shock of seeing him on screen again in The Force Awakens this December. All combines to make a thoroughly amusing and exciting film; the best non-Bond spy film in some time. Please don't see Fifty Shites of Grey over this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Embarrassing,"Very glad I didn't waste money on seeing this cringe worthy film at the cinema; it was in parts pathetic, embarrassing and crude. Whatever humour it purports to possess went straight over my head and I consider myself well endowed with a rich, black vein of deadpan running through me. The cgi was very poor; why have such a large amount of it when it's so poor? The younger actors uniformly clichéd and inept. Samuel L needs to call it a day; Colin Firth is a mediocre talent; here he attempts something akin to Patrick McNee and comes up woefully short. Overall, it's a filthy little rag with a fetish feel about it that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Childish muck, avoid.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A great combination of action and comedy,"Kingsman was originally a graphic novel by Mark Millar (the creator of Kick Ass) and Dave Gibbons. Having read the novel, it's a decent story, that is sort of a coming of age film combined with a James Bond-like setting. It's a decent novel, but in my opinion it is overshadowed by Millar's previous works. However, the movie takes his ideas to different levels, and in almost all aspects it outperforms the novel.The story is about a less fortunate 'lad' named Eggsy (Taron Egerton), who lives in a council flat after his father; a kingsman, is killed in action when he was a child. The movie centres around the spy world of the kingsman, Eggsy being trained to become a kingsman, and Samuel L Jackson's plot to 'save the world' by killing most of humanity, in what can only be described as a send up of our technological progress in the last 20 years.Colin Firth is the true star of the show however, displaying the class and mannerisms of the gentlemen that are the kingsman, while kicking some serious ass in some scenes, and making amusing jokes in others.The action you would expect in a spy movie is there in full force, some scenes are directed extremely well, combining a blend of blissful carnage while a blistering soundtrack plays overhead. The comedy is strong as well, while it may not be laugh out loud all the time, the film ticks along with a constant pace of puns and quips you would expect from this genre.The movie also pokes fun at the genre throughout the film, whether it by using sarcastic remarks, breaking the fourth wall or using Eggsy's working class background to undermine the gadgets and flair of the 'kingsman'.While the movie is great fun there were a few minor niggles that annoyed me. Obviously there are changes from the novel that change the story, but there are certain lines (one in particular involving a Swedish princess) that sometimes leave you almost cringing, and really felt out of place in the context of the movie.Overall, if you are looking for an action packed movie full of entertainment and surprise then this is really good fun movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Never judge the movie based on its trailer,"""Do not judge a book by its cover."" is often the common idiom that suits to possibly many underrated films out there, including ""Kingsman: The Secret Service."" There has not been any sacrament of myself planning to watch this movie because of a dull and cliché trailer that gives off an impression of the cheesy action movie with a ghost of hidden excitement. It definitely resembles to an obscure and mediocre Hollywood goof, solely based on the trailer.However, I ended up watching it after coincidentally getting involved into the plethora of great reviews and positive opinions about this film that have littered the media and my surrounding. And I am glad I did. Almost everything about this film stands out among a lot of its counterpart. The introductory starts strong off by unleashing bits and pieces of prowess and personality of the private organization, Kingsman in the most entertaining way. And as it carries on, things get more intense with more character development and a series of predicament that leads to the breathtaking climax after a great amount of well-written shenanigans that transpire in different places which makes the cast twice look cool and bona fide. Although, I wish the director had them articulate little slower or clearer to neutralize the accent to make it easier for others to comprehend.By watching a whole movie, each cut scene that I think of it as an underwhelming performance or over-the-top in the trailer surprisingly turns into an awesome sequence. It does not squander a minute to fully describe the protagonist who puts all of its energy into improving himself while fervently vying for the one and only Kingsman title with several others under the Kingman's unerring guidance as well as using all the skills he has obtained during the span to fight against the ominous and wicked pair that tries to get a grip on everyone in the world with manipulative SIN cards that can be inserted to mankind.There is no such thing as ""Too much"" or ""Too little"" in the name of Kingsman. The moderate amount of characters, dialogues, and battle scenes are timely introduced and shortly edited. And what every character says is critical and relevant to the plot and those words speaks for its identity. The same thing goes to the battle scene. It effectively capitalizes on a shaky and fast-paced camera technique as well as focusing on significant parts where nifty artifice and brutality are vividly depicted. The massive scrum of entire nation beating each other up has more depth to it because as the outset gradually builds up, the origin of the outbreak gets disclosed, thus gives you another reason to watch it.In a nutshell, the atmosphere of this film reminds me of the mitigated, but funnier version of ""Kill Bill"" sequel where the meaning of death is quite redundant. Obviously, the level of blood spattering and cruelty is different, but sharing one similarity would be the main character focusing on its nemesis as the deadly number of enemies and unexpected twists ensue. What truly differentiates the ""Kingsman"" in a good way from the ""Kill Bill"" would be types of weapons with a variety of uncanny attributes and the level of humor in which most action genre can rarely utilize.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Spectacular Spy Flick,"When Eggsy was a toddler, his father was killed in the line of work. He was given a special medal by a well-dressed gentleman, telling him that he can call when he is in trouble. Seventeen years later, growing up in a rough London suburb, Eggsy got himself thrown in jail after engaging police in a backwards car chase. He calls the number behind the medal, and in comes the dapper Harry Hart to the rescue. Knowing Eggsy's wasted talents in gymnastics and academics, Harry brings him to try out for a vacancy in his ultra-secret spy organization, the Kingsmen.The fun begins with the opening credits, when letters would form out of the rubble that fell from various explosions of an ancient temple, to the tune of Dire Straits' hit ""Money for Nothing"". You knew by then that you should be ready for something tongue-in-cheek. The beginning sequences do not hide the fact that this would be a graphically violent film. Throughout the film we will be regaled with fights with guns, bombs, and blades, all in extraordinarily spectacular fashion we have never seen before.Colin Firth, an actor who is practically typecast as the shy or dour guy in romantic comedies, shows a totally screen persona here. As Harry Hart, aka Galahad, he is a swashbuckling super spy like we have never seen him before. Mark Strong makes another memorable screen appearance as Merlin, the Number 2 man among the Kingsmen. The ever reliable Michael Caine plays Arthur, the head Kingsman. You know he can play this role with his eyes closed.Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as the villain Richmond Valentine, an insane megalomaniac telecom tycoon with a lisp planning to have mankind kill each other. Exotic beauty Sofia Boutella is Valentine's vicious henchman Gazelle, a graceful killer with her deadly sharp prosthetic legs. Mark Hamill was unrecognizable as the elderly environmentalist Professor Arnold, whose abduction starts the action.The biggest surprise is the breakthrough star-making performance of Taron Egerton as Eggsy. In the beginning it took some time getting used to the new face. But as the film went on, Egerton will possess the screen with his action skills and suave charm, even in the presence of his esteemed co-stars. By the time the film ends, you could not wait to see more of this young man in future films.Overall, this is a very entertaining, visually stimulating film. The production design, with all those gadgetry and weaponry, is very inventive and eye-catching. The musical score is pulsating and exciting. The action sequences were really relentlessly bloody, with various body parts getting impaled, sliced off or blowing up. Yet, this was all done with typically British wry humor and aristocratic class.Director Matthew Vaughn takes the James Bond genre, and mixes in the superhero and hi-tech elements of two excellent films he directed before (""Kick-Ass"" and ""X-Men: First Class""), as well as some Cockney elements from his earlier productions like ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". With ""Kingsman"", he has actually managed to create something even more fantastic. This is the best 2015 release so far. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Wes Anderson does Quentin Tarantino,"I haven't gotten this giddy, this wide-eyed excited about an action movie since the 2009 Star Trek. Maybe 300 before that, and The Mummy when I was more of a kid. Kingsmen had me by the ladyballs literally from the first five seconds, as I imagine it might for many other Western World 80s and 90s kids. It might be my favorite movie opening to date. In fact, the whole film is visually spectacular, from the speed of the fight scenes to the thoughtful framing and color choices to the classy and unique way they integrated cg into their spy tech.It was actually pretty well-written, too, and I'm picky about that. For frame of reference, I think Avengers looks pretty cool but the dialogue is dreck. Kingsmen, though, asks you to suspend your disbelief as much as you would a comic book movie, but also provides answers to many logic holes that a viewer with half a brain would have. That said, much of its charm is also borne by its formulaic story. Like in the aforementioned Star Trek, our young troubled hero must prove he's worth his father's salt to an organization he's destined to join, and does so by helping to defeat a sociopathic supervillain. I'll trade originality of plot for sharp one-liners delivered by an intelligent cast in these rare cases.The film has its flaws of course. Sorry ladies, Kingsmen is a boys' club, save the occasional tropey man-eater female assassin or damsel busting at the seams. Oh well, you can't have everything. TL;DR: This movie is f'ing spectacular. If I were British I probably would have loved it to an unhealthy degree.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Hard R -- biggest disappointment of the year - KILL BILL meets SCARFACE,"This is the biggest disappointment I've had at the theater in a long time, even worse than NOAH. The idea was outstanding, with the flavor of 007 James Bond from LIVE AND LET DIE days with the cool gadgets and the cheeky humor. Everyone I know wanted to see this movie. Then, they put in more cussing than SCARFACE and more blood than KILL BILL and drowned it in a Hard R that left the audience stunned and confused. If this movie had been a PG-13 for the family, it would have been the beginning of a chain of profitable and enjoyable movies for these folks. Instead they made fun of rednecks and Republicans, used the F-word as a conjunction in every sentence in the movie. Had scenes that were so brutal and out-of-place in this funny little movie, that I looked at my wife and mother and they were covering their eyes. They drowned this guaranteed winner in obscenity and blood. If you are an 18 year old Marine or just out of jail, enjoy. If you are a parent or on a date or any other member of the target audience for movies, SKIP THIS sleazy piece of poop!!!!",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
crazy funny spy action,"I saw this movie in a theater. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, and ""Kingsman"" is greater than I expected.This movie doesn't have very thrilling scene.

I like ""that"" scene very much.Colin Firth and Taron Egerton are really cool. Also, their spy gadgets are cool and exciting.There are a lot of highlights in this movie.

Reminded Me of Hot Fuzz...Only Better,"I went into this movie expecting just a fun spy-action comedy. I certainly got that, but it felt like a lot more than just that.Kingsman: The Secret Service has a very goofy plot. It's over-the- top, and it certainly knows it. However, the plot is still serious enough to keep you interested. Considering the handful of twists throughout the movie it easily keeps you engaged, and although you love laughing at how over-the-top it is, you still want to know the overall outcome.The characters are quite well done. Sure, some of them are a little cliché, but that doesn't necessarily make them bad. Plus most of the cliché-ness is drowned out by the greatness of the rest of the movie, so I hardly noticed it until after the end credits rolled. They still felt real enough to keep you engaged in who they were and how the plot drove them forward.The action scenes were fantastic. The camera work and constant speed of each duel was captivating, and oftentimes quite hilarious. Nevertheless, they're some of the most engaging fights I've ever seen, and some of the overall best. The choreography is fantastic, to an almost unreal level at how people are capable of moving as smoothly and quickly as they do (I wouldn't be surprised if there was some editing on the speed of each character though. Nonetheless, they were always beautiful to watch). Most of them appear to be done in one shot for the most part, which is even more fantastic. And considering the plot twists throughout, you were never sure who would actually win a fight, which really kept you on the edge of your seat.Overall Kingsman: The Secret Service is not at all what I expected, and in this case it turns out to be a good thing. The plot is silly, yet serious enough to keep you engaged, the characters are well- done, and the fights are stunning. This movie reminds me of Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz, with it's goofy plot and over-the-top action, only I thought this movie was better. If you did like Hot Fuzz, then you'll love this. In the end I would highly recommend Kingsman: The Secret Service. It surpassed my expectations on every level, and I'm sure it'll do the same for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
