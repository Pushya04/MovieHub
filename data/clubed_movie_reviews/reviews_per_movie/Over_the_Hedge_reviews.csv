An enjoyable film with a bit of everything for everyone,"Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a ""family"" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun movie that thoroughly demolished my low expectations,"Let me say up front, I had low expectations going into the film. Although I like animation a lot, I wasn't too impressed with previous Dreamworks attempts. I tend to regard cutesy previews with suspicion, and was mostly just going along to have a potentially positive movie-going experience with my family. Things got a little worse when we arrived at the theatre, and both the ticket-tearing guy (if cinemas have a technical name for that role, I don't know what it is) and some poor sap from the commissary tried to pressure-sell the ""fresh"" soda and popcorn. We had to go out of our way to avoid an extra ad-hoc kiosk the food vendors established smack in the middle of the lobby. I hope that doesn't become standard practice. The twenty-odd minutes of previews were similarly underwhelming, and I was starting to get a little nervous -- is it going to be one of those days I'll want to forget? Then, at long last, Over the Hedge starts. Now I'm not an avid follower of the comic, partly because I don't get to read newspapers very often. The Over the Hedge strip is kind of a latecoming competitor to affections reserved for the beloved Bloom County of my childhood, so I'm not exactly salivating at the potential content. However, I gotta say, I was blown away from the start.Over the Hedge is a neat movie. Granted, there are points where plot development is pure formula, and some of the dialog seems forced or weakly delivered, but these are minor snits. I was laughing out loud, along with most of the audience, which was well distributed agewise. I won't offer any spoilers, but I have to hand it to the screenwriters for seamlessly integrating action-based slapstick with some very cunning dialog, dialog that flies fast and furious enough that you'd better keep both ears wide open.Messagewise, there are a few worth noting. I have not seen such a cutting indictment of suburbia since Edward Scissorhands. Some audiences may find the humor cuts a bit too close to home -- literally. Human eating habits are intensely scrutinized, for obvious reasons. Vanity and self-serving hubris are duly repudiated. Plenty of clever asides will appeal to a wholesome sort of cultural nostalgia, without ever seeming derivative or repetitive. There are both heartwarming and chilling references to the importance of family, especially a family under external pressures from a society that they do not understand, a culture that considers them vermin. But the messages aren't overplayed, and mesh well with the rest of this utterly hilarious movie.There's more, of course, but the bottom line is entertainment, and this movie did not disappoint. Even the extended slapstick, which I seldom enjoy in movies, was so outrageous and excessive that it punched through to my funny bone and had me slapping my knee along with my family. Oh yeah, my family -- they liked the movie too, they liked it a lot. Over the Hedge is one of those solid films to which parents can bring children and everyone has an unreserved good time. That puts it in some pretty esteemed company -- right up there with Toy Story, Finding Nemo, A Bug's Life, et al. Highly enjoyable, highly recommended, 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Funny, Witty, and Well voiced!","While this movie doesn't have the depth of Finding Nemo or Shrek, it was a very fun and well done animation by Dreamworks. The animation was first rate, and the animals were very fun to watch. The voice acting was superb and well cast. What I enjoyed the most about this movie (other than the super funny bits here and there) is the social commentary they presented. It's nothing serious, but it shows us how gluttonous many of us ""humans"" have become. While many of the human characters are exaggerations, there's quite a bit of truth behind each caricature. My favorite is the Home Owner Association President. She was so overdone (yet so realistic!) that I wasn't sure if I was laughing because it was so true to life, or if it was just so out there.Anyway, good movie, good times, and go with good company. After some mediocre animation movies from Dreamworks, they hit a good one again with Over the Hedge.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surpassing all the expectations...,"Like most people, I was convinced that Pixar's ""Cars"" was going to be the animated movie of the year and that ""Over the Hedge"" was just another cheap attempt with the proved formula of cute talking animals. I was very surprised by the end result as it ended up not only being an enjoyable fable about friendship and the typical stuff, it is also a very witty commentary about our modern way of life.Based on the syndicated comic strip written and drawn by Michael Fry and T. Lewis, ""Over the Hedge"" is the story of R.J. (Bruce Willis), a witty and knowledgeable raccoon with a problem: he must restore the food he stole from a bear in two weeks or he will have to be eaten in its place. To do it, he decides to raid the houses of the new suburban landscape, and to do it he recruits a group of naive animals who never had seen a human before. almost without knowing it he'll become a member of the family and will begin to have serious doubts about his plan of deceiving the gang.Directed by Tim Johnson and Karey Kirkpatrick, ""Over the Hedge"" is a huge step forward from Dreamworks' previous animated feature, ""Madagascar"". Technically the movie looks beautiful and the animation is for the most part superb. Great care was taken with the characters' design and while they look quite different from their original versions, the change was definitely for the better.The plot at its core is once again the typical story of an outcast who finds a family, but it's spiced up by the satire and wit of the original comic strip and that's what makes the movie different from others. This balance between the comic strip's sharp social commentary and the funny and simpler slapstick comedy makes that the film can be enjoyed by both children and adults without being overtly filled with pop-culture references. The characters are very well written although due to the large number of them some may feel a bit underdeveloped.The voice cast is appropriate, although like in most Dreamworks movies, movie stars are preferred over professional voice actors creating a bit of a mixed bag. Bruce Willis is good, although nothing spectacular, and Garry Shandling as Verne, the gang leader, was also not as surprising. On the other hand, Steve Carell makes a brilliant job, as well as Wanda Sykes and a surprising Avril Lavigne. Wanda Sykes, William Shatner and Thomas Hayden Church are also brilliant.Frankly, the movie's biggest flaw was the large amount of characters it has. While everyone has their moment to shine (and in most cases is very well used), at the end one has the feeling that either the movie was too short or that there was one or two characters too many. The movie's plot also may be predictable to most people, however, the way the director handles the movie truly makes up for the unoriginal storyline. Tim Johnson proves his talent once again and demonstrates why he is a very underrated director.To summarize, I was very surprised by the way ""Over the Hedge"" developed and I truly enjoyed it. It's great assemble of characters and the witty script makes up for its defects and the final product is a very good one. While it probably be overshadowed by the more popular ""Cars"", this sleeper hit definitely deserves a watch. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hedge your bets on fun,"The computer animated film has become to film studios what Mike Tyson was in the ring in the 1980's: a sure thing. You knew that when Tyson walked in the ring, somebody else was going down, and probably rather quickly. The same is true of most computer animated comedies these days: it is near sure to be a mix of material targeted at children and adults, feature lots of star voices and be entertaining, for the most part at least. Over the Hedge, the latest offering from Dreamworks, does not disappoint on any of the above fronts, and proves to be one more notch in computer animations belt.The film opens on loner raccoon R.J. (Bruce Willis) who has made the mistake of raiding the hibernation supplies of Vincent the bear (Nick Nolte). After managing to lose all of Vincent's food, R.J. is given an ultimatum: he has one week to replace it all, or he will become a bear snack. R.J. then manages to stumble across a group of animals that hibernate together, Vern the turtle (Gary Shandling), Stella the skunk (Wanda Sykes), Ozzie the possum (William Shatner) and his daughter Heather (Avril Lavigne), Lou (Eugene Levy) and Penny (Catherine O'Hara) the porcupines and their brood, and Hammy the squirrel (Steve Carell). The clan has discovered that while in hibernation, their forest was developed into a residential neighborhood and has left them with only a small patch of land to gather food from.R.J. appears and decides to take advantage of the situation: he will show the family how to raid the houses just on the other side of the hedge that separates their small patch of woodlands from the development, and when they have gathered everything together, he plans to take it all back to Vincent. Vern proves skeptical of R.J., but the rest follow along, and Vern begins to feel jealous about R.J.'s newfound place in their hearts. Meanwhile, the head of the development's association, Gladys (Allison Janney) has called in an exterminator (Thomas Hayden Church) to take care of this new infestation problem.Over the Hedge is about as broad based as entertainment comes: it features lots of cute, cuddly animals who perform elaborate hijinks for kids to laugh at, while offsetting this with some more adult oriented jokes and situations for the older set. Over the Hedge is a little less successful at this blending than some other films, such as Monsters, Inc. or Shrek. It is a bit more child oriented, relying on cuter gimmicks than some of it's brethren. It doesn't prove to be off-putting, the film is still more than entertaining for adults, it's just not quite as sophisticated as some that have come before.Plot-wise, Over the Hedge is about as predictable as they come: the outsider looking out for numero uno who gets his heart melted with the kindness of a new family unit he has found. This contributes to the more child centric feeling to the film; many children may not have seen this played out as often as adults, so the material may seem fresher. Over the Hedge manages to combat this weakness by being consistently funny for most of it's running time. There are plenty of good jokes, gags and situations to leave most audience members laughing a good bit of the time (and in the end, isn't that what a comedy is about).Voice-wise, most of the parts are fittingly cast. Bruce Willis has just the right amount of wiseguy smarts in his voice to sell cynical, self-centered loner R.J., Gary Shandling has the perfect combo of worry and parental concern, and Steve Carell brings a degree of hyper intensity to Hammy. Nick Nolte is also near-perfect for a bear's growly voice and Thomas Hayden Church really fills out the exterminator.Over the Hedge probably won't go down as a great entry in computer animated history, but it does it's job well enough to be entertaining, enjoyable and funny. Again, sometimes, what more can you ask?",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Family Film That's Not Just For the Kids,"I grudgingly agreed to screen Over the Hedge this week, despite my lack of interest from seeing the previews. I am thrilled to tell you that it was well worth my time, and left me with a smile on my face the rest of the day. Everything, from the superb mixture of a real likeness and cartoon feel of the cuddly creatures to the creative style of the animation itself to the wonderful script keeps you entertained from start to finish. Not only is it a fun and safe film to take the kids to, the hilarity of these animals making fun of humans and the wasteful consumer environment we live in is hysterical! Not to mention, Dreamworks put together an awesome cast to pull it all together. See? Bruce Willis CAN do more than just action movies!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun when it wants to be, boring when it wants to deliver a message, Over the Hedge is no Madagascar, but is better than previous animated films","Dreamworks, the anti-Disney, is a hit-miss animation company that sometimes delivers few of among the best animated films, but sometimes also flounder by delivering some stinkers. Shrek and Madagascar were excellent animated films that deserve to be in every large ""best animated movies"" list. But, there are also disasters like Shark Tale and also the disappointing Shrek 2. Over the Hedge is not a classic by any means, but it is entertaining enough to keep you awake throughout the short 83 minutes. The voice talent was all there, the writing was there, but the pacing kind of ruins it for a short time. Unfortunately, the sentimental value has to always be thrown in, and the movie totally slows down during those sappy, slow, unhappy moments. But, when a chase scene arrives, prepared to be dazzled and very amused. Thank goodness the third act picks up the tempo as it lifts the film from total mediocrity and dissatisfaction into a nice, charming film that is worthy of watching more than once.Over the Hedge is about a mischievous raccoon named RJ that gets caught trying to steal food from an angry bear, and has a few days to come up with all the food after it all gets destroyed. In the meantime, animals that woke up from hibernation wake up to discover that most of their forest had been turned into a neighborhood. RJ tries to lure the dumbfounded animals into getting all the food he needs, but paranoid turtle named Verne and some surprising circumstances get in the way. A little-known fact about the movie is that it is actually based off a comic strip of the same name.Kind of like what happened with Madagascar, the writing team didn't have to work much on the dialogue, since most of the humor is visual. Either way, they try to sneak by with a few one-liners here and there. Unlike Madagascar (""Well this sucks"") the one-liners tend to fall flat. Also, the low points of the movie all happen in the first two acts, when they were just conversing, when the possums were not being funny, or when the themes and sad moments occur, which there unusually plenty of in the first half. Most of the laughs in the first half came from the squirrel Hammy, which actually wasn't as funny as the hyperactive squirrel Twitchy in the surprisingly funny Hoodwinked.The action and the laughs totally come rolling in when the final act comes in, and the climax rapidly approaches. Almost every character has their moment to shine and deliver humorous moments, even the dry-witted, almost totally boring turtle. The action/chase sequences are well done, well choreographed, as they showcase moments that you really would never expect from any kind of movie. The voice talent finally flexes its acting and hilarity muscles in the final twenty minutes. Also towards the end we see Hammy at his fastest, and that most certainly was a delight. There is an underlying subliminal message in Over the Hedge, and it deals with America's obsession with food, big cars, and never-ending urge to fulfill its desires.Bottom Line: Decent, but really gets good towards the end, which is quite the opposite from the typical summer movie, in which the ending usually falls kind of flat. While it is no Madagascar from the year before, it is still much better than Blue Sky's latest effort, Ice Age 2, and way better than Disney's previous effort, Chicken Little. Excellent casting here, even though they truly do not show their stuff until much later in the film, especially Allison Janney as the stereotypical angry, workaholic single woman. If you can sit through some of the boredom in the beginning the payoff will be sweet as we see one fun sequence after the other, ranging from a dog chasing some of the animals to modern-day-usually awful drive gone totally wrong. Dreamworks is heading in the right direction with back-to-back decent flicks. Over the Hedge: over-the-top, and out-of-control, when it wants to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

However, I had an urge to watch something, something really light. The moment I started it, it didn't make me bore for a moment. I got a sharp idea that it's a story about humans from the eyes of animals. Comes up, it's much more than that. It has real comedy, adventurous sit-com and is cunningly clever. The writing is FLAWLESS. The dialogues are better than amazing. It's one of the movies people watch again and again for the terrific dialogues towards the end. Steve Carrell is a legend!

A  Great Family Film even for Adults!,"The animation is quite brilliant and the voices of stars like Allison Janney, Bruce Willis, Thomas Haden Church, Wanda Sykes, Garry Shandling, and Steve Carrell only enhances the film.

The woman played by Allison Janney is a typical suburbanite with a deep seeded hatred for pests and rodents in particular. She contacts the exterminator played wonderfully by Thomas Haden Church in the role. Their voices add to the characters. Anyway, she sets up an elaborate system where nothing can live in her backyard. Anyway, the animals that live nearby in the hedge are humanized with voices to develop their character senses. There is a lot of adventure in the film and you wouldn't be human if you didn't want to see the animals win this time. It's a wild ride!",,Anonymous,Animation
Urban Sprawl Meets The Varments,"Animated films have some stiff competition. Not only do they have to compete against some truly marvelous predecessors (see SHREK, HOODWINKED, and FINDING NEMO), they also have to entertain not just kids, but adults who enjoy taking their kids to watch such films.OVER THE HEDGE has some great animation and some good voices, but we've seen these things time and again. It also has a morally upstanding storyline (i.e., not betraying your friends and becoming a part of something bigger than just yourself), but we've seen that ad nauseam, too (ICE AGE). What most movie watchers want  regardless if it's animated or live-action  is something fresh, new, and engaging. And that is where Over The Hedge fails. We get the same old story, the same great animation, and the same impressive voice cast.It is the cast that'll keep you watching it, too. Bruce Willis (DIE HARD) is the main character, starring as RJ, a raccoon with a big problem. He attempts to steal all of the food from a hibernating grizzly's cave (Vincent voiced by the gravelly sounding Nick Nolte, THE GOOD THIEF). When the bear awakens before RJ can make good his getaway, RJ accidentally lets go of all the food and it slides down the mountain and is destroyed. He's then given an ultimatum: get the bears food back within a week or be eaten alive. So RJ heads out and stumbles upon an interspecies family that have awakened one morning to find their wilderness world encroached upon by a huge hedge. Urban sprawl has come to their neck of the woods, and this ragtag group's leader Verne (Gary Shandling, THE GARY SHANDLING SHOW) must find out what this hedge is for and why it's there. But Verne is just one turtle and needs the help of his extended family. They include Hammy (Steve Carrell, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE), a nonplussed squirrel with hyperactive sensibilities; Stella (Wanda Sykes, POOTIE TANG), a skunk with an image problem; Ozzie (William Shatner, MISS CONGENIALITY), an overly-dramatic possum caring for his family; and a few others.RJ runs into this clan and spots an opportunity to gather the food he needs for the bear. Manipulating his way into the family, he teaches them about junk food, dumpster diving, and the human world ""over the hedge."" But with the human world comes danger. Most notable among them is Dwayne (Thomas Hayden Church, SIDEWAYS), a varment exterminator. Will RJ risk this innocent animal family in order to save his own neck? The answer isn't surprising.Certainly the voices are entertaining, even more so than the script the actors read. Special notice has to go to Steve Carrell for his hyper-Hammy squirrel who avoids caffeinated beverages until the end when his super-speed is increased to Matrix-like proportions. Also, William Shatner's Shakespearean possum is flat-out fun. But that's it. And for an hour-and-a-half flick, it's not enough.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is definitely one of the better Dreamworks animated movies,"I really wasn't expecting to enjoy Over the Hedge as much as I did. Perhaps not as stirring as the Prince of Egypt or as zany as Shrek, but it is an improvement on Shark Tale. Well, Over the Hedge is absolutely delightful family entertainment. If I had a minor quibble, it would be that the writing isn't always as sharp as it could have been but this is only occasionally, plus the film was a little on the short side. But all the same, it is very very funny especially the uproarious action sequences at the beginning, and the gags come thick and fast. The CGI animation on the animals is very well done and the backgrounds are audacious. The soundtrack is cool, and the story is engaging and heartwarming. The film is also quite sweet, not sickly sweet, like say Troll in Central Park, but naturally sweet.And while the ending is surprisingly great, the real delight comes from the animals and the voice acting. RJ the Racoon is simply adorable, and Verne is another great character. My favourite character though has to be Hammy the squirrel, he was absolutely insane in a good way! And the voice cast? All did a splendid job, in what is essentially an ensemble cast. Bruce Willis and Nick Nolte are great, but the real kudos has to go to Steve Carell as Hammy in one of his better performances. All in all, great animated movie. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Boring and too much cutesy-poo,"How nice, another clone of ""Toy Story"" and ""Ice Age"". A merry band of cute *yawn* furry characters have to overcome various obstacles and live through hilarious *yawn* adventures in US Suburbia.Ever since I saw the first ads and trailers, I just knew they were going to play it safe. Everything is so politically correct and cute, it hurts. Again,there are stars and has-beens such as Bruce Willis and William Shatner who provide the voices for the CGI-Characters, but it does not help the movie in any way. Granted,on the technological side its all good and perfect,but why does every 3D-animated movie nowadays have to cater towards a pre -school audience with their (annoyed) parents?I know,I know...more mature stories don't sell that well,and have proved to be difficult to market to an audience that expects Disney-styled cuteness and morally conservative messages. But still, can't they even try (for chrissakes !!)to smuggle a bit more subversive stuff into their projects? No,no that would be too much to ask,I guess. My Prediction is, that if that trend of ""playing it safe and copying proved and successful concepts"" continues, this particular brand of animation will no longer be able to garner interest from the audience. Its just an expensive and overblown exercise in producing meaningless entertainment.Just my 2 Cents. : /",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great slapstick animation mixed in with some social satire,"Just caught a sneak preview of this last night in Hollywood. I didn't go in with much expectations since I wasn't too impressed by the trailer. But I ended up being pretty well entertained. What really stood out to me was the quality of the animation and the great designs of some of the characters, especially the evil Home Owner's Association Lady. What disappointed me was the childish and crude nature of the dialog and humor, with the exception of a few clever gags near the end. Overall it isn't anything you haven't seen before in other cutesy-animal-CGI, but it did have a few unexpected twists at the end and enough satire about suburbia and American consumerism to make it worth a look even for adults. I rate it: CG quality - 8, Character designs - 8, Story - 6, Dialogue/Humour - 6, Overall - 7.5.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Finally, DreamWorks decides NOT to rely on animal flatulence.  Thank you!","I'm always more than willing to carry the ""DreamWorks ain't got nothing on Pixar!"" banner when it comes to the issue of comparing their CGI-animated films. All you have to do is watch Shark Tale (though I don't recommend it) and then compare it to Finding Nemo to understand why.Is it really that hard to find writers that can figure out how to appeal to both adults and children? Anybody can take a big budget and put a lot of impressive CGI on screen (well, except for you, A Sound of Thunder!), but I want something that I actually care to follow.

Granted, Eugene Levy and Wanda Sykes have voices that could inspire me to poke my ear drums out with a kitchen utensil, but thankfully they're not overused, making them surprisingly tolerable.I would warn you not to set your hopes too high though. While there are a handful of laugh-out-loud moments, I was never rolling in the aisles with crazy Benny Hinn-esquire fits of laughter.

dreamworks finally makes a film to hold against shrek,"Desperate for food, raccoon RJ decides to steal Vincent's, a black bear mound of food. The food gets destroyed, with RJ having one week to restock Vincent's supply. It's the end of winter and the mixed group of forest creatures are coming out of hibernation. During the winter season, the forest was enclosed by a massive hedge, with a new suburban estate. Unaware of what to do and where to find food, RJ tricks the group to collect food from the surrounding houses to pay of his debt to Vincent.Of late Dreamworks has released very average computer animated films; with Shrek being their most successful. Over the hedge is the first film since Shrek that can actually be placed beside it. Firstly the animation is a great step forward, leaving the caricature style of animation of Madagascar and Shark Tale behind; all for the better. The animation is bright and colourful, with great detail to the animals and their gleaming bright eyes.The biggest step forward is the driving force of the jokes; switching from pop cultured references to dig into the characters for the meat of the jokes. Cultural references end up as easy laughs, that lack a lot of punch. While there are some pop culture references, they are minimal and not glaringly obvious. Adding depth is the subtext on humanities consumption and waste; it's no wonder many have called the recent rise of obesity an epidemic. Also added into the subtext is our impact on the environment and animal life.Feeling more of a star vehicle, the voice talent is some what disappointing. Garry Shandling delivers such a lumbered and monotoned voice to Verne, lacking so much energy. Avril Lavigne should stay in music, with nothing special as Heather. Wanda Sykes exaggerated jive attitude is so tacked on. William Shatner does his usual style of over acting, and works great. Nick Nolte and Thomas Haden Church bring fun as Vincent and exterminator Dwayne. Bruce Willis does great as RJ and really carries the film. Though basically stealing the light in everything he does, Steve Carell just takes over every moment he's on, perfectly suited to the hyperactive Hammy.Over the hedge is fast paced and never looses your attention, one of the most interesting animated films of late.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

This is a movie that children can also enjoy (sounds kind of odd being that animation films are usually supposed to be for kids), in addition to adults.

Unlike animation movies of recent times, which shamelessly displayed the power of CG, this movie has a very firm control of its power. The animation is brilliant and the cartoon exaggeration is well within the limits. Finally , the climax grabs the lion's share (or should I say Bear's share??!).

So awful I can't even bare to live anymore,"Awful story... little to NO characterization... tired plot... over-used characters (anyone recognize Hammy from an equally terrible movie Ice Age?). The only thing good about this movie is that it was THANKFULLY not even an hour and a half long, although I found myself wondering how they even stretched it that long. Within the first 5 seconds you'll know exactly how the movie is going to end so you might as well leave--the journey to the ending is a boring and labored one. But I'm sure America will bite right into it just like they do to every other movie corporate America tells us to like.

Oh...My...Gawd,"Wow! Wow! Wow! I was transfixed! The animation? Gorgeous! The subtle humor? Uproarious! The not-so-subtle humor? Even better! This was a great movie that will surely be nominated for an Oscar if for no other reason than the beauty of the animation. While I could have honestly thought of a couple of better casting choices, I will mention that Wanda Sykes, Thomas Haden Church and Steve Carrell were brilliant in their roles. And who better to make fun of William Shatner than William Shatner? Worthy of special mention (and a second look - go see this movie again!): the Rottweiler interludes, the ripples in the water, the porcupine quills, the oh-so-amazing foliage throughout the movie, and Vincent's cartoonish-yet-strangely-scary expression.Really REALLY a great movie that should appeal to all.Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
This was horrible.,"I don't normally rate films so low, but this was a major disappointment. I was not impressed by the trailers, but was encouraged by all the positive reviews. I rented it with some expectation of a good time.This film is paced for four year-olds with ADHD. There is a chase or a crazy action sequence or just characters darting around the scene every 10 seconds. You can hardly tell what's going on, and you never learn anything about any of the characters. By the end of the movie, I could only remember a couple of their names, even.The 'emotional' scenes that the movie attempts do not work at ALL, because you know nothing about who these animals are, what their history is, or what relation they have to each other. They are just a random bunch of animals, each with his own, irritating and frenetically-paced shtick, that live together for some reason. RJ is this raccoon with no back story at all, and the film starts with this random scene where he is in front of a vending machine, and then suddenly tries to steal a bear's food. Who is the bear? How do they know each other? Why is this raccoon living alone? What happened to his family? Does he have ANY personality beyond trying to get food ??And when did it suddenly become OK to make movies that are this crazy and don't bother to tell you anything? The other thing that is SO annoying here is that all the animals have to exaggerate every word and facial expression to the point where they are just obnoxious, hyperactive, flailing, face-stretching ciphers. The human characters are even worse and do nothing but scream a lot, gesture wildly, run around, and again twist every facial nuance into grotesque overacting. What happened to characters being believable or even close to realistic and having normal conversations?It is just stupid and this is not what animation is supposed to be. A *little* overacting is sometimes necessary to get the mood across, but this has gotten ridiculous. It was a little annoying in The Road to El Dorado, Treasure Planet, and some of the newer films, but it is taken to unbelievable extremes here where every character is doing it constantly.This movie was so irritating I almost shut it off. The only thing that kept it going was an occasional joke that was funny. Otherwise this was totally stupid and I would not recommend it if you are the type who enjoys a NORMAL movie that has actual character development, drama, well-timed humor, good story pacing, etc.There are too many great animated films out there to waste your time on this one.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Imaginative and humorous, and there's something for everybody!","This film is about an animal having to steal a lot of food to prevent getting killed by a bear. In the process, he made a lot of friends, learnt about family, trust and betrayal.I was very pleasantly surprised about this film. It was imaginative, fun and humorous to watch. It got me laughing out loud so many times. The jokes were funny and kids friendly too.It was also amazing how they gave seemingly everyday items and routines another light. A phone was rebranded as a device for summoning food, a door was called a portal for the entry of food. I never thought about it that way! The lateral thinking seen in this film was entertaining and fun.There were loads of intense action scenes to keep kid interested, and for adults, there were plots about family, trust and betrayal. There was something for everybody! I strongly recommend this film!",,Anonymous,Animation
Fun Animated Movie for Kids & Adults,"After having seen this movie in theaters, I have to admit: it easily ranks as one of my favorite family movies that I've seen. This is just another gem to come from Dreamworks Animation, who've had more hits than misses in their history. Based on the comic strip by Michael Fry and T. Lewis, the film revolves around a family of scavengers, led by Vern the turtle (voiced by Garry Shandling) who awaken after winter to find that their forest has been overrun by a housing development. They are approached by RJ, a raccoon voiced by Bruce Willis, who has his own reasons for wanting to assist in their hunt for food.Unlike some of Dreamworks previous animated movies, this one does not have nearly as much humor aimed at adults. Fortunately, that doesn't keep it from entertaining. The characters are lovable and the writing is fantastic. The animals' adventures across the hedge make for some really enjoyable scenes. The animation in this movie is spectacular as well. When you think about the detail that had to go into this movie, it is really impressive. The fine detail of the animals' fur and how it moves, and the massive amount of particle effects (the corn chips!) show the length that the animators went to in their effort to make this movie look good.Of course, you when looking at this movie, you have to make mention of the superb voice acting. Bruce Willis, Steve Carrell (as Hammy the squirrel), and Thomas Haden Church (Duane, the exterminator) are the highlights of this movie and they alone make it worth watching. We are also treated to great performances from Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, Eugene Levy and more. Despite the few lines she is given, Avril Lavigne does a pretty good job with her first acting role.All of these components come together to make a great family movie that is great for kids and adults. There really isn't too much one can find to say negatively about this movie. Hopefully, Dreamworks will realize the strength of this movie and turn it into a franchise, continuing to bring us the exploits of Vern, RJ, and the rest of the Hedge crew.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Excellent characters, with distinct traces of personality and voices that fit each animal in the story perfectly, not to mention the human characters as well.With a cleverly crafted social and ecological message, it's the perfect summer hit for young and old alike.7 out of 10 , for the above mentioned reasons.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

It may be a kids movie, but I think that everyone should just watch this movie. The plot is not complicated at all, you understand the story perfectly, well of course you should watch the movie from the beginning to know what is it that it's exactly wanted when the animals go for the food.. I really recommend this movie..!! my friends didn't like it! but it's just so funny.I also know Spanish, and I also watched it in Spanish, so if you speak Spanish!! it is funnier.!!! because it has all of this Mexican jokes, just like Shrek.. in Spanish is so much more better!.. because of who does the voices.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Kids will love it, adults will love, and I loved it.","In 'Over the Hedge' Bruce Willis plays RJ, a raccoon who is in trouble.

Where's that little Clown fish when you need him?,"*1/2 out of **** starsOver the Hedge sadly confirms my waning interest in the digital animation genre. After being enormously impressed with Shrek, Monsters Inc. and Finding Nemo, the films that I've since seen from Pixar and Dreamworks have had mediocre plots and trite dialouge. This movie is no exception. Over the Hedge has no sense of adventure, which I believe is a crucial element in an animated story.After a lengthy hibernation, (only bears are supposed to hibernate, but oh well) the cute little animals simply discover - wow! - suburbia, where you'll find exciting things like SUVs, cell phones and two-story homes with identical green lawns. Let's also not forget all the awful Americans who live there. No, not one person is around with any sense of decency. The adorable creatures are more graciously human than the humans, which I suppose is a metaphor for how much people have strayed from benevolence and a sense of community. Our furry little friends are ecstatic about discovering this neighborhood because of all the processed food they find there, but the residents want them dead so they hire an exterminator, who is aptly titled ""The Verminator"". At numerous times the film segues from its elementary story to show us gratuitous, dizzying chase scenes that I couldn't focus on, not that I wanted to. It seemed as if the Animators created these segments to compensate for a weak script. They will certainly appeal to a kid, especially if he or she is under six and has an attention disorder.Over the Hedge is artificially arresting. Of course it is! They all are! It seems to me the computerized craftsmanship of this genre has been set, at least for now, and no one is falling short. The voices are good also. No big surprise there. If we continue to give so many accolades to the superstar actors and musicians who speak the parts, we should also honor all the bygone men and women who were doing it decades ago, and who were just as good.I'm not oblivious to the fact that animated movies are primarily orchestrated for children, as they should be. But this genre has proved its appeal to all ages with much better films with more depth and scope that involve jokes with double-meaning: Mom and Dad get it one way, the Kids another.If you rent this movie one day and find yourself too busy to watch it, don't worry...press play. Feel free to leash up your dog and walk him around the block or finish up those dirty dishes at any time. Don't hit pause. Just keep it rolling. When you return to your sofa you'll fall right back into it. You won't miss a thing. Over the Hedge is so predictable, so simply formulated you can't even pride yourself in knowing what will happen next or how it will end.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sometimes the simplest stories make the best films,"My low expectations were floored by a great adventure à la DreamWorks  a simple adventure about survival in which a raccoon 'accidentally' steals and loses all provisions belonging to a ferocious bear, whom then threatens him and demands he replenish every item of food lost within one week or else he will suffer the consequences. Over the Hedge thus sees RJ the raccoon (Bruce Willis) scour the environment in search for goods, a mission that is facilitated when RJ comes across a mismatched family of forest creatures whom he convinces to help him gather the food he needs from the Suburbian residences just over the hedge.The film opens with RJ on a scrat-like adventure after that-one-piece-of-food and he suffers all the detours and diversion that this mission entails. As is the meticulous animation style of DreamWorks, it lacks the rewarding simplicity of Blue Sky Studios (Ice Age) and does not quite achieve the same level of hilarity and laughter that the latter effortlessly elicits. It even mimics the possum playing dead from Ice Age: The Meltdown which evokes more raised eyebrows than anything. At this point I am also noticing that Willis' voice is much too muzzled and unremarkable to be lent to a protagonist. Although, Nick Nolte makes for a fine bear villain.Soon 'Over the Hedge' thankfully abandons mediocrity and completely stuns me with layered humour and an energy that it begins to apply to all aspects in the film, the hyper-active ADHD squirrel Hammy most of all. It spirals into an enjoyable romp evenly peppered with 1) goofy light laughs for kids (courtesy of Hammy the squirrel), 2) balanced gags-for-all such as the hilarious zealot exterminator who botches his way through the tracking down of the pesky vermin and 3) sophisticated humour and interwoven references from Citizen Kane, A Streetcar Named Desire and Dr Phil. It is a perfect amalgam of different sorts of comedy and blends and balances its content with deft strokes. Granted, the story neatly ticks off clichés from a formula but it does so skillfully.Indeed there is a surprising amount of sophistication to be found when you weed through all the standard spoofs. Specifically the film directs social commentary on humans'  and animals'  eating habits as RJ remarks how ""We eat to live. Humans live to eat."" It juxtaposes these lifestyles when the forest family teams up to assault the neighbourhood in which larger-than-life boxes and packets of nachos, donuts and popcorn are abundant and the shiny silver fridge is Mecca. In the midst of the food-heists there is much action to be found in the form of vibrant, kinetic chases, shooting rockets and acrobatic stunts over the hedge. It is even a bit chaotic toward the end but a great slow-motion capture ties the pacing together.The aforementioned render 'Over the Hedge' a very alive film and its action alone rightfully vaults it into 'Great Animated Comedies' status. It is no Shrek, but it's extremely enjoyable. Like Shrek however, DreamWorks provides for the crisp, aesthetically-intoxicating animation of nature whose every screenshot is so picturesque that you just want to snap a picture of, frame and hang in on your wall. What's more is that its heist-oriented core with its mandatory sense of immediate danger tingling in the air is something of what Mike Tyson was the boxing in the 1980's: A safe bet.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Over The Hedge,"Animated films are being made ever more frequently, and, like any genre, the quality of the films have their ups and downs. Over The Hedge shows us not only how far CG animation has come, but also how potentially destructive the genre can be to itself. With expectations raised so high by quality films from Pixar, or films like Shrek, each time a new animated film comes along we once again expect that extra bit more. There has to come a point where the films can no longer match the hype we place upon them, and Over The Hedge feels like it could be the start of this.That's not to say that Over The Hedge is a bad film  its not. It is good, and the audience's enjoyment of the film could possibly be measured by how engrossed in the CG animation scene they are  the more films of this kind they have seen, perhaps the less they'll enjoy it; this is not down to the quality of the film itself, but more because it is such a run-of-the-mill, seen-it-all-before kind of film.I will reiterate though  it is not a bad film. It is mostly average though because, despite the charm of the characters and the attractive look of the film, the structure is so blatantly predictable; the mismatched group of animals, the climactic chase, all-star voice cast, even the character's themselves  the manic one, the cautious one, the cocky one  are all present and correct. And that is why, for me, the film didn't reach the peaks of other animated films. It seems to be playing the safe route, not taking any chances and just emulating (although, it must be said, sometimes improving) what has come before.The cast do have considerable charm. Bruce Willis seems to have cut himself lose and really gone to town on making his character, problem-causing raccoon RJ, an enjoyable one. Other highlights include Steve Carell as manic squirrel Hammy (a total scene stealer) and Omid Djalili as a Persian Cat and the guardian to the suburban household that the animals are trying to steal the food from. However, other members of the cast are not really used to their full potential, but the focus is never on them for too long.The animation is, as one would expect by this point, faultless  but there is really no excuse for it not to be  and the style is more riotous then other films, which at least gives the film a visual distinction from other CG films. The humour is good but the film really only starts picking up in the second half  the first half drags a bit and takes too long to get going, again making the film stall. However, there are some stand out scenes, such as the views from space (where we see the exaggerated effects the animals have on the suburb) and a hilarious scene featuring Hammy's caffeine-augmented speed, which is so fast time seems to stop for the rest of the world.In short, the film should be perfectly enjoyable to children, but adults will be harder to please. Over The Hedge is not a bad film, but I feel that the producers need to make something more original, something that goes against  or at least plays with  our expectations. Making the same films with a different cast each time is beginning to get old, and it is a shame but I suppose it had to happen eventually.Rated: 6.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Atrocious,"I don't think I've ever paid to see a worse movie than this. If I had been on my own I would have left the movie 1/3 of the way in. Unfortunately I was with my kids who also thought it was atrocious, but for some reason wanted to see what happened.The characters are all horribly schmaltzy. It feels like a feel-good TV series from the 1970s, only without what little humour those shows had.Do yourself a favour and stay away from this one. 1 1/2 hours of my life gone, and too much money to think about.

Perfectly executed computer-generated animation masterpiece is fun, smart, cool and totally packed with memorable moments.

"""Hedge Is Better Then The Recent Flood Of Animated Films""","RJ the raccoon must repay a food debt to a grumpy old bear, Vincent. On his quest for food, he comes across a small family of animals living on the side of a hedge. With no food but tree bark and twigs for the group of animals, RJ takes charge as he cons them into gathering food for hi to give to Vincent.I expected Over The Hedge to join the list of Valiant, Shark Tale and Madagascar as animated films that come and go. While Hedge does take a while to get to the laughs, it's the second half of the film that saves it from being added to that list. It seems that after the success of Toy Story back in the day and Shrek being noticed as a film to bring the animated films out of the closet, many actors are jumping at the chance to add their voices to the colourful characters of animation. Hedge is packed with many big names, who's voices all work perfectly with the characters. Carell is perfect as the always on the go squirrel and Shanter is genius as the always playing dead possum.The animation is better then expected, with the fur on the tails and the blades of grass all looking very impressive. The only downfall lies within the humans. Much like Toy Story, they humans in this film look amateurish to me. Dwayne, the verminator, looks like he should be voiced by someone like Patrick Warburton, but Church did an honest job at it.Running under 90 minutes, the film does come and go pretty quickly. It leaves one to think that they could have done so much more with the film. With a slow start, it would seem that Hedge is not really going anywhere, but with the second half of the film, mainly the house raid, Hedge is able to move ahead of the pack. I was surprised by the amount of laughs it got out of me. Hedge is definitely better then the recent flood of animated films, and you'll be glad you gave it a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Not vintage Dreamworks, little immature but OK family movie","The premise was cute, a bunch of forest animals are getting squeezed out of their habitats because of a sprawling suburbia so a wily raccoon played by Bruce Willis helps the animals gather food for hibernation. The raccoon is collecting the food items from people's homes to pay back bear who threatens to kill him if the food isn't there in a week, so raccoon gets the help of the forest animals to complete this foraging task. Sort of like an Ice Age premise where the tiger is bad then turns good for sake of herd or family since the raccoon winds up saving the animals from a local exterminator played by Nick Nolte.Great screenplay, Garry shandling as the turtle was the head of the group but was uninspiring as he is more talented than the role given. Bruce Willis was gentrified as the other characters, except the skunk who saved her scenes. The hammy character got laughs from the kids and adults as a hyperactive squirrel.Sort of a Robin Hood theme of its OK to steal from the haves and give to the havenots which isn't the best lesson for the real youngsters, but the audience was rooting for the creatures all the way. The animation was top shelf as anything from Dreamworks.In conclusion, I'd wait for a rental for this one as its a notch below the Incredibles and at least 2 notches below both Shreks.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Action sequences early in the movie that had people roaring with laughter were topped by ones later on and small tidbits of comedy were spread throughout.

lively and endearing,"""Over the Hedge"" is a high-spirited, fast-paced addition to all those talking-animal animation movies that have flooded the multiplexes over the past several years.In terms of its setup, ""Over the Hedge"" provides the flipside to the earlier ""Madgascar,"" in which a bevy of zoo animals traveled out of the city and back to the wilds from which they - or at least their ancestors - had originally come. In ""Over the Hedge,"" the animals are already living in the country, only this time civilization has come to them in the form of a brand new suburban housing tract that has sprung up in their vicinity while the denizens snoozed away through winter hibernation (that's one fast-growing housing development, I must say). Despite the dangers inherent in crossing over into human territory, the animals decide that the abundance of conveniently pre-packaged snack food to be gotten there is just too good to resist and that the benefit to be derived from such foraging expeditions is well worth the risk posed by any irascible, irate humans.""Over the Hedge"" benefits from clever, well-delineated characters, cute facial expressions on the part of the animals, fine voice work from the likes of Bruce Willis, Gary Shandling, Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, Nick Nolte and Allison Janney, and a storyline that moves along at a brisk, action-packed pace, well-suited to the often wavering attention spans of children and adult viewers alike.

"Go On, Take A Peek","Who would've thought Bruce Willis would be playing a troubled NYPD officer and a mischievous raccoon both in the same year? Well he has, and done both quite well. Bruce Willis, along with Eugene Levy, Nick Nolte, Wanda Sykes, & many others appear in the all-new Dreamworks animation, 'Over The Hedge'. Which is brought to us by the director of 1998's 'Antz', Tim Johnson, and the producer of last year's hit 'Madagascar' and the writer of the upcoming 'Charlotte's Web', Karey Kirkpatrick. In 'Over The Hedge' we are taken into what is left of some woodland creature's home, now invaded by suburban life and surrounded by an encompassing hedge. They now have a dilemma. Where are they going to find food? That's where Bruce Willis' character, RJ the raccoon comes in. He explains to them on the other side of the hedge that there are plenty of delicious varieties of food. Including Hammy the squirrel's (Steve Carell) new favorite, nacho cheese flavored chips. While Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling) is skeptical and warns the others that it isn't safe over the hedge they all go along with RJ anyways in hopes of retrieving tasty treats. What they are unaware of is that RJ only wants to gather food for a hungry bear (Nick Nolte) so he himself doesn't get killed.'Over The Hedge' is nowhere near other animated films like 'Shrek' and 'Toy Story' in terms of greatness. It lacks a certain quality that is inexplicable. But it's still highly enjoyable. The animation itself is very good, there's lots of funny moments for both children and adults to enjoy, and the story is good. (Although there are a few flaws in it, but nothing major.) The good thing is 'Over The Hedge' isn't being made out to be what those other films were. From being based on a comic strip it sure turned out to be pretty good. If you haven't seen it already, I suggest you take some time and go see what's over the hedge. You might just see something you like.",,Anonymous,Animation

Lewis that launched in 1995 and is still going strong, because you can look for it and find new Over the Hedge comic strips to this day; the animated movie by DreamWorks is either seen as ok by some people or liked by others as a good animated comedy that is not particularly perfect, and I am one of those who like this movie for what it is. The animated movie Over the Hedge (2006) is a funny animated comedy with well-done voice acting from a great voice cast, good 3D animation, entertaining characters, and quite a few funny moments; this movie is not perfect or anything, but I enjoy watching it from time to time, and there are some songs in the movie that are catchy or nice to listen to.The raccoon RJ voiced great by Bruce Willis was a clever and funny character, with him just trying to get enough food back for a bear so he is not the one to get eaten by tricking this group of forest animals to help him; yes, there is a liar reveal story involved here with his character, but I did not mind it when he is growing more attached to the family of animals. The turtle Verne voiced by Garry Shandling was also a funny character, with him taking care of his family animals by doing whatever to find food then starting to go back and forth on if he should trust RJ or not; I liked the interactions with him and RJ on how they should do certain things to steal food from humans, but mostly on how Verne will not agree with what RJ does for food or how he executes a plan. Lastly, you have the rest of the animals named Hammy, Stella, Ozzie, Lou, Penny, and Heather that are voiced great by Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, and Avril Lavigne; each one of the have their own personality and can be funny, especially Steve Carell's character Hammy, who had quite a few weird moments.There are technically three antagonists, with one being someone who is a pain that lives in the suburbs and is the president of the Homeowners Association voiced by Allison Janney, along with a funny exterminator named Dwayne voiced well by Thomas Haden Church and the bear that RJ needs to get food for named Vincent who is voiced well by Nick Nolte; these antagonists can go from funny to kind of annoying to just being standard. The 3D animation is not bad with it having enough detail on the animals, the hedge, and the many things in the suburbs you can notice; the movie has quite a few funny moments or funny lines of dialogue from the characters that can also lead to some weird, entertaining, or just random moments too, especially in the third act climax of the movie.The movie Over the Hedge (2006) is a funny and entertaining DreamWorks movie that I like to watch from time to time, and I can understand why there are some people out there or people I know who think the movie is just ok; I remember the movie many years later, and I think that is good when it comes to an animated comedy, especially since I do like DreamWorks. If you have not seen the movie before, then it is worth watching once just to see an enjoyable animated comedy like this, and worth seeing the early days of DreamWorks's animated movies; a good movie I will remember and will watch again whenever I get the chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Over the Hedge"" is the best animated film since ""The Incredibles.""","A raccoon named RJ (Bruce Willis) attempts to steal the food from a hibernating bear (Nick Nolte). RJ unfortunately gets caught and the food gets accidentally destroyed. In an attempt to save his life, RJ has a week to bring the bear all the food he destroyed. On his way to the suburbs, RJ happens to come across a group of various animals who have just awoken from hibernation. The animals soon discover that the rest of their forests have been cut down and the only thing left is a giant hedge that blocks them from entering the human world known as the suburbs. With the help of RJ, the animals make a plan to get enough food so they can survive for the year and replenish their food supply for next year's hibernation. A very fun and entertaining animated film ensuesI have always been a big fan of animation films and there have been some really great animated films in the recent years and I am proud to say that ""Over the Hedge"" ranks up their with various Pixar products such as ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Monsters Inc"". ""Over the Hedge"" is probably the best animated film of the year and I am not sure if ""Cars"" will be able to top it. This film is loaded with fun and interesting characters that each has their own unique humor and personality to them. Every character from RJ, to Hammy to Ozzie was unique and this made watching each character fun and enjoyable.Most animated films focus on a few main characters in ""Over the Hedge"" you have about a dozen or so main characters so for DreamWorks and the writers to pull off every character being liked is quite a challenge but they did it flawlessly. I also found the writing and dialogue to be very clever and witty. This is definitely a film that is going to win over both the kids and adults alike. It's well crafted, well written, and has various enjoyable characters.Normally I don't understand why animation studios get a big name cast to voice their movies but in this case, I think the voice talent was amazing and actually made the film a little better. Being a fan of most of the actors and actresses who voiced this film I was able to identity all the characters based on their voices. William Shatner, Garry Shandling, Avril Lavigne, Eugene Levy, Bruce Willis, Steve Carell and Wanda Sykes were all instantly recognizable in my eyes. I think I see the purpose of the big name celebrities now because some of the characters have actual resemblances to the actual person or roles they played. I think everyone did a great job voicing the characters and I absolutely loved the little hedgehogs and Hammy.If DreamWorks keeps making films like ""Over the Hedge"" I think they could one day be bigger and better than Pixar who I still feel makes the best animated films. But ""Over the Hedge"" is the closest thing I have seen to a Pixar film (outside of ""Antz"" which was better than ""A Bug's Life) and it is a lot better than last year's Madagascar which I liked but it wasn't as great like most people raved about. DreamWorks and Pixar are both companies that are goldmines because while ""Over the Hedge"" may not make $80 million its first weekend like ""The Da Vinci Code,"" it will still make a lot of money and be playing for many weeks to come.In the end, ""Over the Hedge"" is probably the best animated film to be released from DreamWorks animation studios in years. It's definitely a great film complete with great voice talent, witty and clever dialogue, likable characters and a pretty good script. There really isn't anything to complain about with ""Over the Hedge,"" it's a great movie that both children and adults will love and enjoy for many years to come.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Over the Hedge"" is an 8/10. A must see for those who love animated films that have a nice mix of comedy, drama, action and lovable characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, but not necessarily fun-ny","This movie was a lot of fun. Original,clever, and perfect for the whole family. But the humor was... so-so. The character Hammy was hilarious, RJ was comedic. But I would say the only humor you would laugh at would be Hammy's. Everything else, I think you would just smile at. But It is still a pretty good movie.But everything else was great! Great characters, good plot, good script, and a great twist to your average animated movie.I give this movie 7/10 because I enjoyed it and it was a pretty good movie. It was not necessarily memorable, but it'll last a while and its still a pretty good family film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Behind The Hedge Lies Danger And Food,"Though I'm not as much a Dreamworks fan as I am of Pixar, they have made some exceptional stuff like 'Kung Fu Panda', 'Shrek', 'Flushed Away' etc. 'Over The Hedge' also belongs to this category mainly because of the humour that works on so many levels (satire, slapstick, absurd, outrageous, situational etc). In a subtle way, the film is also a social commentary about suburban life, the influence of infrastructure on nature and people's eating habits. Johnson and Kirkpatrick have done a fabulous job as directors. Moreover the voice cast that includes Bruce Willis, Wanda Sykes, Allison Janney, Gary Shandling, Steve Carell, William Shatner, Catherine O'Hara, Nick Nolte, Thomas Haden Church etc is first rate. The CGI animation is of top quality, very detailed and full of depth. The vibrant colours are very appealing to the eyes. 'Over The Hedge' also makes some hilarious references to other classics. I won't give examples as they are best left for the viewer to discover and enjoy. Overall, 'Over The Hedge' is solid entertainment.",,Anonymous,Animation
It Felt Shorter Then It Actually Is,"This was a good movie. The casting was perfect and visually it couldn't have been better. Despite me not liking Ben Folds I will say that he was the perfect choice for the soundtrack. The characters were loveable and I personally really like Hammy and Verne. My only real issue was that the pacing felt a little rushed but to be fair the whole plot had to happen within a week so it would make since to have it feel that way, it's just that in doing so the movie felt shorter then it actually was. There was though something small that I adored and that was seeing and hearing the THX theme during the heist scene; I love their theme and it's my favourite intro sound that I've ever heard. Also something I love about early 2000 family animations is their creativity with the menu, it's a small touch but it's charming.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fine Slapstick animation,"RJ the raccoon (Bruce Willis) is a schemer. When he finds the bear's stash of food, he tries to steal it. However things go wrong, and everything is lost. Now the bear expects RJ to replace the lost or else. RJ finds a group of scroungers, and plans to use them to get food from the surrounding suburbs.The animation is a bit blocky, but it's an acceptable level. There is a lot of slapstick humor. It's like a Looney Tunes cartoon at times. The one thing that is missing is a break out character or two. Maybe there are too many characters. Maybe the characters look too generic. For an animated movie like this, it's always better to have a break out character. There are opportunities to add characters in any follow up sequels.It's a perfectly fine slapstick animated comedy. The problem is that it doesn't stand out. There are great comedic voice work especially from the unique Wanda Sykes. But it's not enough to warrant any follow up to this.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Let's call it SteveOver the Hedge,"There are so many animated films coming out a year that it is tough to bring yourself to see any of them. Sure the Pixar brand means instant gold, however, the multitude of studios popping up with computer graphics are really watering down the quality. Especially with every studio releasing the same thing in competition, how many free from the zoo films did we sit through, it is a true surprise when one of these films surprises you. When I first saw the commercials for Dreamworks' Over the Hedge, I had very mixed feelings. I never quite bought the huge hype surrounding the Shrek franchise and Madagascar was a bit of a letdown, so I wasn't sure what to expect here. Although the story isn't anything original, the parallels to Toy Story are very prevalent as well as multiple callbacks to Indiana Jones, Citizen Kane, and A Streetcar Named Desire, etc., the all-star cast and comic relief do make the film a fun ride to sit through.I was a bit surprised at the dark beginning. Before the credits role, (don't get me started here, animated films should not have a prolonged credit sequence, we aren't watching these names act so don't try and sell us by name dropping when we are already seated and watching), there is a confrontation between our reluctant hero RJ and a bear named Vincent. While the quarrel does set up what is to happen, it was a bit edgy compared to the clips I had seen in the trailers. Fortunately, the film doesn't take too long to break the drama and go into the fun atmosphere of our setting, a small patch of green left behind by the suburban sprawl. RJ must recruit the woodland creatures to help him enter his alien world and find food to feed Vincent. Sure we will have the obligatory turning on the leader for the new guy, the antics to get the job done, and the change of heart to save what really matters most in life, but besides the cookie cutter plot line we are treated to some hilarious characters.Bruce Willis does a nice job as RJ the raccoon and has a good rapport with his equal in leadership abilities Verne, voiced by Gary Shandling. These two are the straight men throughout, doing what they can to rally the troops into succeeding at their tasks for the Spring. It's really the periphery roles that steal the show. I generally find Wanda Sykes to be abrasive and annoying, but she reins in her schtick for an effectively bitter skunk in one of the few family-orientated jobs she has done. William Shatner parodies himself as usual, doing the pause ridden speech patterns he is loved for and Eugene Levy is also great as the husband without a backbone, agreeing to whatever seems the right thing to do at the time. The best of all the lemmings, however, is Hammy the squirrel, voiced perfectly by Steve Carrell. Hammy's manic energy does wonders to create big laughs and allows for many of the best gimmicks. His fighting with himself in a mirrored bumper and the hunt to catch the laser pointer's red dot are priceless.A big reason for many of the new animated successes lies with how original the characters involved are, rather than how fresh the story is. Over the Hedge is a perfect example of this, and while a movie like Madagascar fails despite the crazy penguins, this one is a winner as a result of its quirky cast. By allowing ample screen time for the roles that work, one forgets how derivative the tale is because they are so caught up in the antics. Credit the filmmakers for getting the little things right here and not trying to bog down the fun with unnecessary drama. Even the GPS brought laughs as I wish the real ones would restructure their directions when off course by asking for illegal left turns.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
better than expected,"RJ is a ferret that has a great problem, Vincent the bear has threaten him to eat him unless he recovers a wagon filled with provision. RJ will use Verne's family (a bunch of different good-oriented animals) to achieve his objective. He will lead them to the city, where they can steal the things that human doesn't want. The movie intends to be a fun comedy (it has some great moments) and a light critic to human society, too consumerist, and it remains in a strange fifty-fifty, that, unusually, is not upsetting. The quality of the design is good and it results correct to the movie, maybe the action scenes are a little too quick but that's not very bad. I expected it being as bad as "" a Shark's tale"" and it is much better, it does not arrive to ""finding Nemo"" or ""the Incredibles"" but remains as a correct movie. The result is a film that can entertain the kids and that will not bore the parents.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
So much better than you can possibly imagine,"My wife and I were able to attend an advance screening of Over the Hedge, and the two of us thought it was great. I had no idea what DreamWorks was planning to do with the comic strip, but I was pleasantly surprised. I am not a Madagascar or Shrek fan, but this film was actually pretty good and certainly worth my time. I am holding out hope that people who were otherwise on the fence, will decide to see it. Subtle messages about equal treatment, honesty, trust, and friendship are present without being heavy handed. The satire about America's consumer driven economy(particularly in the food industry) is relevant, refreshing, and intelligent. Adults will easily enjoy this film as much as kids, which is no easy task for a cartoon movie. I'm a big classic Disney fan and a lover of animation in general, and my advice to people who have a soft spot for great animation is to take the time to see what's ""Over the Hedge"", my daughter thinks that RJ and Hammy are the two cutest animals ever created. The trailer sells the slapstick humor that will draw its target audience into the theater, but please be aware that this film does in fact have heart and substance. I'm even wondering if the torch will pass from Disney to DreamWorks this year. In either case, Over the Hedge definitely gets my support!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly Charming Critter Food Feature,"In 2006, Dreamworks Animation came out with a brand new animated comedy called Over the Hedge, based on the syndicated comic strip of the same name by Michael Fry and T. Lewis. Despite gaining positive reviews and a lot of box office receipts, the film seems to have been forgotten amongst the Dreamworks filmgoers, let alone family moviegoers in general. Released in between Dreamworks' early glory with Shrek and Madagascar, and their surprisingly smash hits like Kung Fu Panda and How to Train your Dragon, this one stands out more in the juvenile side of things. However, looking back, it's not half bad for its audience.The film focuses on a mischievous raccoon named RJ, who has to replace a bear's hibernation stash before getting mauled. Upon discovering a turtle named Verne and his fellow woodland friends, who discover that their forest is overwhelmed with a ginormous suburb, RJ shows them how to exploit the suburbs for food. As a film based on a comic strip, one would imagine this might work best in an episodic structure, yet the film manages to tell a pretty tight narrative overall. One thing that Dreamworks does best in some of their movies is setting up the stakes as early as the first acts, and this movie is no exception. Even while RJ is a charismatic enough chap to the woodland creatures, even we as the viewers fear for the clock ticking before Vincent the bear ends his life, all because of food no less. As a result, there's so much pressure throughout the film from each and every character, such as the conflicting views between RJ and Verne. Where one is impulsively pushy yet friendly, the other is more demanding yet cautious for the critters, and that banter along makes those two very charming.As for the characters themselves, in addition to having quite unique looking designs, the voice cast is mostly very solid. Bruce Willis is charmingly charismatic as RJ, Gary Shandling has the right amount of nasally boisterousness in Verne, Allison Janney and Thomas Haden Church chew the right amount of scenery as the suburban owning Gladys Sharp and overly-zealous pest exterminator Dwayne LaFontant, and Nick Nolte is just made for the disturbing menace in a bear. Being a Dreamworks film, of course the all star cast like Steve Carrell, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, William Shatner and Avril Lavigne will be up for the younger viewers to enjoy. Beyond that though, what older viewers might find more amusing is the surprisingly subtle yet poignant commentary on abundant consumerism. In a day and age where human beings have created even more unnecessary demand for stuff that suits them, be it houses around former forests or more food for the privileged than the homeless, this film satirizes that at the expense of the environment, something we still need to keep in mind.With all that said and done, I think there are some noticeable aspects that could either make or break the film depending on the viewer. For one thing, while well executed in their own right, the film does utilize the liar revealed trope that is quite common in a lot of family movies, and let's just say that if the movie wasn't made for a younger audience, RJ would have come off as a lot less likable. Also, despite the film carrying some rather fun songs in some scenes, they do sound like outdated pop songs that just make it obvious when the film was made. Fortunately, they are far and few in between, and they don't overly date the film like other forgotten kiddie fodder. Lastly, it's obvious the film was intended for kids just as much as adults, if not more, so there is a lot of really immature comedy sprinkled throughout, including gags about Verne's naked body and Hammy's gestation. I can see kids enjoying that way more than teens and adults, but then again, if you grew up with the movie and still enjoy it now, these jokes might not be that unappealing after all.So while it might not rank as high as other popular Dreamworks ventures, Over the Hedge is a surprisingly fun filled flick with just enough substance and humor to lighten up the experience. It's kind of unfortunate that this is somewhat obscure amongst the Dreamworks Animation filmography, because for all its flaws, it seems far from being anything avoiding. Perhaps it is seen heavily amongst a cult fanbase, but if that's so, it wouldn't hurt checking it out at least once. After 15 years of it being out in the open, there's no telling what else RJ and friends could do next, unless you read the original comics.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Only If You Really Like Little Kids' Movies,"When I watched this a few weeks ago; I sat there wondering how anyone over the age of eight enjoys this movie. I wasn't exactly one hundred per cent eager to watch this movie, granted: it was only really because I thought my eleven-month-old half-sister would like it.All the characters are so cute and politically correct that they just lack any of the fun and amusement that you can get from the characters of other movies of a similar vein (I'm thinking along the lines of Shrek). While some of the voice actors were people I kinda liked seeing in other stuff (William Shatner and Avril Lavigne); they didn't save the characters from this dorkiness.If you ever consider watching this movie; I'd seriously recommend that you forget it.

"Well animated, great voice work, fun characters and a half-decent  plot...what more could you want?","Call me childish, call me immature, do as you wish, but I really enjoyed this movie. It's cute, it's funny, it's just plain enjoyable all around.The plot is nothing new really, basically just a dummed down gangster type plot. A raccoon named RJ (voiced by Bruce Willis) is caught trying to steal food from a bear (Nick Nolte), and is given a week to replace it or else the bear will eat him. He comes across a family of woodland creatures, and tricks them into helping him. Needless to say, the obligatory guilt trip soon follows as they welcome him as one of their own. It's nothing we haven't seen before, but kept my interest and had some pretty fun plot devices, mostly near the end. The only thing that could have been better about the plot was that it wasn't very fleshed out, everything seemed to happen all at once.The actors were all a lot of fun, and the voice work was great. William Shartner does a great job making fun of himself, playing a completely over the top possum. Willis also did a very good job as the raccoon, as did Garry Shandling as Verne the turtle. But, as the previews would lead you to believe, it's Steve Carell that really steals the show. His manic, insane, hyper-active squirrel, Hammy, was easily my favourite character. Sure, some of his jokes might have been a tad immature (Wanna help me find my nuts?), but I still found myself laughing at every perfectly delivered line he said.I don't know what else to say other than that this movie is a lot of fun.

A typical animated family film.,"Over the Hedge tells the story of a rogue raccoon that has to gather food for a vicious bear, but he only has a week to do it. He stumbles upon a group of animals living in a park surrounded by a suburban area, and he tells them he can find them food. However, he is actually gathering food for the bear. As the animals befriend him, he ends up getting them into trouble with an exterminator and a woman who lives in the neighbourhood. When the animals find out what he's really up to, they all leave him, but now it's up to him to save them from the lethal exterminator. This movie is entertaining, but compared to all the other animated animal movies for kids, it's nothing special.Lately an abundance of animated films featuring cute fluffy animals have been released. I remember back in the early 90's when computer animated films with fluffy animals were something new and different. Now these movies just don't seem to have a soul anymore. They're all exactly the same and they follow the same formula. There's always a character that everybody likes, but then they find out that character's a liar or something, and then the character has a change of heart at the end. It always happens. It's the same with this film. It has some really funny moments and a few entertaining scenes, but overall, it's not that impressive because we've seen it all before.This movie has a great cast. Every voice you hear belongs to a talented actor or actress (except for Avril Lavigne of course), and it makes the movie just a bit more entertaining. The best voice work comes from Bruce Willis and Steve Carell, who do good in their roles.Overall, this movie has it's moments, but it's nothing new and exciting.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A childhood spectacle that is still entertaining,"A cunning raccoon deceives the families of forest animals to help him in paying off his debts. They stole food from a newly emerging home while hibernating.This is the spectacle of my childhood. How many times have I repeated it when I was a child. And now I'm watching it again. I remained amused despite how many times I had played it before. This film amuses me from the behavior of the animals in stealing food. Likewise, women homeowners and animal officers are seen appearing as a balancing character. Interesting story with a good cartoon style. Have a growing conflict with the various problems caused. Also in the intensity of the excitement of the story is maintained and increased. I think the level of cuteness and comedy that is given is just right for children.

It isn't the comic strip,"Over the hedge, the comic strip is a witty commentary of modern life as seen from the point of view of native creatures living just over the hedge from suburbia.This is not the movie though.

He has one week to get it all back.

Interesting and likable at best,"A raccoon tries to get the help of a group of woodland creatures to gather food for an angry bear before the moon gets full.With a list of a-list actors, including Bruce Willis, Steve Carell, William Shatner and Nick Nolte, this 2006 DreamWorks picture provides stability and a few laughs, in a pretty ordinary but still highly lovable story.Willis voices raccoon R.J who tries to gather food for angry bear Nick Nolte. Like plenty of other plots in the animation genre, a character goes into something then half way through he goes into deep and his emotions get all confused, so don't expect anything different with this picture.Most characters are plain and provide little entertainment but watch out for Steve Carell's squirrel Hammy, who is so full of life and energy you can't help but smile when he is zipping all around the screen. Willis' raccoon is likable at best, Shandling's Verne is interesting to watch as the over protective turtle, with some good moments. Others lend good support, if somewhat predictable. Like Hammy, Tiger, voiced by Omid Djalili, is funny and gives the film a different dimension with the sophistication and high class to the character against the rough and wild forest animals, in an interesting but brief comparison.The plot, predictable once R.J joins the group, is consistent, with some exciting moments involving the hedge and the humans. An interesting point could have been developed about building houses in forests but was never touched after one brief mention. The differences between animals and humans gets a good shout out, as does animal cruelty.With animations being so frequent in modern cinema, it would take something of a massive gamble to make a true classic; such was recent Pixar masterpiece Wall-E.With a run of the mill plot and little humour, Over the hedge stands as interesting and entertaining at best.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Enough of that.I'm here to talk about Over the Hedge! It is original, funny, well-paced and very easy to sit through with my twelve year-old daughter and friend. We all laughed throughout the movie. They laughed at some of the jokes, but mainly at the usual silliness and cute animal antics. I laughed at the endless references cynically poking fun at life in the suburbs in 2006.

Understanding why we see animals encroaching into city suburbs,"(2006) Over The Hedge
COMPUTER ANIMATION
FAMILY/ SOCIAL COMMENTARYNot the most appealing story ever made but self-explanable regardless centering on a conniving and manipulative raccoon using other animals of different breeds to steal food for him for the purpose of submitting it to a disgruntled bear. ""Over The Hedge"" as the title indicates refers to a small area that's only inhabited by the few small animals that still live there but are encircled by the suburban house market which much of their natural food selection was taken away as a result of more houses and properties being built. And as a result of their natural wilderness inhabitant taken away, the animals would collide with each other to enter the forbidden zone or suburbia for the intention of gathering enough food to feed all of the animals living amongst this rather small forest area surrounded by a hedge. I didn't think the film was funny at all and also thought that the raccoon was annoying, which leaves nothing but the social commentary regarding the problems of increasing the suburban housing market within the forest region where animals may need to adapt in terms of natural selection. Although the message clear, it's almost short-changed by the annoying raccoon.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
It Didn't Blow Me Away,"I chuckled a few times at some of the funnier moments in this movie (which says something right there - the funniest moments could only get a chuckle out of me), became quickly tired of the rather preachy satire of suburban life which reminds us all of the ridiculousness of human wastefulness, and frankly found that the story revolving around RJ the Racoon was unoriginal and bland.Essentially RJ has ripped off Vincent the bear by stealing his food, and Vincent gives him a week to replace it - or else! RJ enlists the unwitting aid of a group of animals led by Verne the turtle to raid the human suburb on the other side of the hedge by sharing stories of the decadence of human society and how everything revolves around food, with much of it ending up in the garbage, and telling them that the food is for them, but really with the plan to use their sweat to get himself off the hook with the bear. In the end RJ learns the requisite valuable lesson about family and how they support each other.It's hard to say who this film was really directed at. The cute animal characters seem to make it a kiddy film, with the moral message and the RJ/Vincent situation seemingly being more understood by adults. In the end, I didn't think either audience would be truly blown away by this, in spite of some very good animation and an excellent cast of voices. Overall, I thought it was a mediocre movie. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Par for the genre course  OK for kids but only a handful of laughs for adults,"When raccoon RJ tries to steal the junk food stash of hibernating bear Vincent, he is given a week to replace it or become the food himself. RJ seeks out a new human community that has just been built. Meanwhile, a community of animals awaken from hibernation to find themselves cut off from the wilderness and separated from the neighbours by only a hedge. Despite the reservations of Verne's tale, the community of animals is convinced by RJ that they can gather lots of food from the humans rather than the wild. However RJ's impatience to rebuilt the stock of food for himself sees the neighbours taking action against the invading animals.When people rent a comedy or an action movie, they don't expect it to be good simply because of the genre it is in. They might expect it to be their cup of tea because generally they enjoy comedy or action movies but simply being in the genre is no proof that it is any good. Although it is not really a genre per se, the films that fit into the world of Pixar animation with plenty for kids and adults with famous voices have historically been seen as well worth checking out. However, although the standard may have been set high when Pixar first hit, their have been some weak examples  indeed some of them from Pixar themselves. So it is with Over the Hedge, which has its moments but does seem to have assumed that if it just does what everyone else is doing then it will make money.Which I'm sure it did  however this is different from the film being a good example of the genre. The plot is the usual morality tale with animals in it, which serves its purpose and allows for a ""message"" to be taught. This I had no problem with but it was the fact that the script was not smart enough or funny enough. As opposed to being full of golden one-liners and references, the script is actually mostly dialogue and the film relies heavily on physical comedy. I'm sure this is fine for kids but as an adult I found myself not laughing that often. It was still amusing though and I did have a handful or belly laughs  perhaps not enough to make it stand out but certainly enough to make it distracting fun for the 80 short minutes it lasted.Following the conventions of the genre, Kirkpatrick directs with a steady hand and the film mostly looks good but he doesn't do a great deal that marks him out as special. It doesn't help that he is served with a terrible collection of songs that I personally found quite painful at times. The film also does the usual thing of loading the cast with famous voices but it seems to forget that really the casting should have focused on getting the right voice  not just the big name. This applies to a few but none more than Lavigne, who offers little more than her name. Willis is not offered much material but his voice is solid and his presence good. Shandling is good but does occasionally sound like he knows the material is a bit below him. Sykes is obvious and her character seems to be little more than her race. Carell is everyone's favourite, partly down to his delivery but mostly down to his material as he is easily the best character in the film. Nolte was well cast for his character, Church doesn't do much but Levy and Djalili are well used and give good performances. It was disappointing that the script did not make more references to Shatner as an actor  he was OK but the only time I was amused was his overacted ""death"" scene.Overall then, an amusing if not totally successful entry in a genre that has seen standards drop of late. It has its moments, looks good, has plenty of famous voices and has a handful of good laughs but it is not as smart or funny as it would like to think it is. At times I did get the impression that it hoped that simply by aping others it would somehow just work. Good for kids and with the odd laugh for adults, it is amusing entertainment but just don't expect it to be anything other than par for the course.",,Anonymous,Animation
Simple yet effective entertainment,"I did not know what to expect from 'Over The Hedge'. I had not read any reviews or ratings. Just decided to pass some time with animation film.But after the 80 minutes of unexpected fun I must admit this film is worth at least one-time watch. The plot is simple. A bunch of animals living in a small wilderness come to know about human civilization beyond the hedge boundary. RJ, the raccoon helps them to know about human world and tells them how they can get easy and delicious food from the humans. Soon RJ becomes hero of the pack and is loved by all, also RJ finally gets to have a family. But they are unaware that RJ is collecting food for own personal purpose and will be betraying them.The pacing is brisk, the characters are interesting and the screenplay is funny and entertaining. The dog-chase sequence was hilarious and the Verminator thing towards the end was really bad-ass! I really liked the description about Human Food given by RJ, it really had satirical touch to it. Also it addresses the themes of family and betrayal very well. While overall, Over The Hedge may follow a predictable path but its simple and intriguing fun like no other. Don't miss it!RATING: [3/5]",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A fun but predictable animated adventure,"A Fun but Predictable Animated Adventure
""Over the Hedge,"" directed by Tim Johnson and Karey Kirkpatrick, is a light-hearted animated comedy that brings the forest to the suburbs. The film follows a group of woodland creatures, led by the cunning raccoon RJ (voiced by Bruce Willis), who awaken from hibernation to find a suburban neighborhood encroaching on their habitat.The ensemble cast, including Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, and Garry Shandling, provides plenty of laughs with their lively and eccentric characters. The animation is vibrant and colorful, capturing the contrast between the natural forest and the manicured lawns of suburbia.While ""Over the Hedge"" delivers humor and family-friendly fun, its storyline feels somewhat predictable and lacks the depth found in other animated features. The themes of friendship, cooperation, and environmental awareness are well-intentioned but are handled in a straightforward manner.Overall, ""Over the Hedge"" is an entertaining movie for a casual watch, offering enough charm and comedy to keep audiences engaged, even if it doesn't break new ground in the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hungry woodland animals fight for food and against the pest-removal service,"I quite enjoyed the prequels. Not so the actual movie.It reminds me of the ""good ole days"" of violent cartoons and limit animation.This movie was so full of violence, I could hardly watch. And tho the animation wasn't as bad as the old days, it still left a lot to be desired.Some other reviewers found good life lessons to be learned here. Frankly, I couldn't involve myself in the story line enough to see them.Basically, hibernating animals awake one spring to find their environment has been altered. Some cute lines and interactions. They are whipped into teamwork by a raccoon with ulterior motives. They do battle for the garbage leavings of a householder who is terrified of wild animals. She hires an exterminator. There ensures violence and property damage. Great for anyone who enjoys seeing things blown up. I don't.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
So lovable,"Wonderful animated experience about a group of animals particularly Bruce Willis's character trying to get food for him, a bear, and his new friends. I love watching Over the Hedge every few years it's so much fun for any age! The colors are so vibrant too which is so nice!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun,"Suburbia is lightly satirised in this enjoyable, if flimsy, new animated effort from Dreamworks. After getting caught in the act of stealing  and subsequently destroying  the possessions of a hibernating bear, a raccoon by the name of RJ has one week to retrieve the items, or else he becomes supper. Along his plight he encounters a group of fuzzy, wacky wood-bound friends, all of whom have awoken from hibernation. After conning them into helping him, they venture off ""over the hedge"" in search of food, encountering dogs, televisions and SUVs (""How many people does it hold? ""Usually just one"") along the way.Whilst the movie does take a few clever digs at modern day suburbia, Over The Hedge is never truly biting enough to really hold the adult's attention. The animation, gags and characters are all perfectly fine, whilst never being truly memorable. It is the kind of movie that will keep your kids entertained long enough so they don't bug you about buying them the latest hand-held console or cry over spilt ice cream. There are certainly enough fart gags, and wacky set-pieces to have them laughing all the way through this film, but in the end, you come out feeling fairly ordinary. None of the characters, whether it be the lead in RJ (A somewhat miscast Bruce Willis ) or the supporting cast like Hammy the Squirrel (Steve Carell) are particularly memorable, in the way that Pixar's classics like Toy Story or Finding Nemo boasted wonderful creations, both visually and vocally, like Mr Potato Head or Sheldon the Turtle. In short, it is a movie far too light to really stick in too many kids minds once they have left the cinema.Yet despite the obvious ephemeralness of it all Over The Hedge doesn't really strive to be narratively wonderful like Toy Story, which deals with the idea of losing one's childhood, or even Spirited Away, dealing with confronting responsibility, whilst being wonderfully dark. With this kind of flimsy set-up and the forgettable nature of the characters, this is an amusing way to spend time with the kids. You would be hard pressed to dislike the film, but you won't love it. Which I think is a shame, given the precedents both Pixar and Dreamworks had set themselves after Shrek and Toy Story.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was bugging me....,"So from the time the movie opened, RJ reminded me of someone, his face.I thought and thought. (Mostly thought I was crazy). I figured it had to be a relative of mine or something, there was just a familiarity to the raccoon face with someone in my mind. How could a movie raccoon remind me of a human? About 2/3 of the way through, it dawned on me. I wish I could find a good still so that I could do a side-by-side comparison.He looks like Elijah Wood.

A fun family movie,"This animated gem follows a group of forest critters who wake up to find their home transformed by suburban sprawl. The star of the show? A hilariously scheming raccoon named RJ, voiced by Bruce Willis. He teams up with a bunch of lovable forest animals, including a jittery squirrel named Hammy, voiced by Steve Carell. The film is a fun mix of humor and heart, with tons of laugh-out-loud moments, especially from Hammy, who has an unforgettable caffeine-fueled scene that still cracks me up every time! The animation is vibrant and engaging, making the suburban landscape feel both familiar and absurd.The movie cleverly addresses themes of friendship, community, and the intrusion of humans into nature, all while keeping it light and entertaining. It's a fantastic watch for families or anyone just wanting a good laugh. If you're in the mood for some cheeky squirrel antics, this one's a winner!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Well-animated satire with a worthy cast,"I always find myself with a lack of creative things to say when commenting on animated films, so I'll make this brief: ""Over the Hedge"" is a cute, well-animated morality tale (with themes of family, redemption, and the value of hard work) with an excellent cast: Bruce Willis as RJ, a thieving raccoon on the run from Vincent (Nick Nolte), a gravel-voiced bear; RJ meets with a group of hibernating animals, from earnest turtle Vern (Garry Shandling) to porcupines voiced by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara (re-creating the wonderful chemistry evidenced in their work with Christopher Guest). While the dazzling animation will appeal to kids, adults will appreciate the biting commentary on the suburban landscape (including an hilarious explanation of how humans obtain, consume, and dispose of food).",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
I love nuts!,"As a person who doesn't read many comics, I never miss a day of Over the Hedge. The movie doesn't disappoint! The Hammy from the comics really comes alive on the big screen (my favorite part is the Mach 6) and Verne the turtle stays true to his comic character. Some of the characters in the movie never appeared in the comic strip but they fit right in. The movie had enough slapstick for the kids and enough innuendo for the adults. Bringpopcorn because the movie will motivate you to eat junk food but be careful of the soda...at some points it might come out your nose!

Mediocre; lacks originality,"What might have been. The popular comic strip becomes the latest source for an animated movie about talking animals, but the source material was wasted. The comic strip pokes fun at mainstream life, putting a bunch of forest animals in an awkward co-existence with Urban (or Suburban, actually) encroachment on their way of life. The gags that can be tapped are endless, and so the comic strip has a loyal following.Not enough of that is adapted for the screen. The two main guys, RJ the ambitious raccoon and Verne the naive yet ethically wise turtle do some of their shtick, but it's lost in a forest of uninspired plot devices. RJ rips off a bear, who, as you might expect, plans to bash his head in, and who can blame him? The forest creatures spend their time acting out RJ's schemes, such as stealing a wagon full of a famous cookie product placement brand being sold by little girls.Add to that the cheap joke of an exterminator (he must be evil because he has thinning hair) who uses nukes to kill vermin. Worse still is the Cruella de Ville act-alike/sound-alike who runs around screeching all the time.The movie makes a half hearted effort to instill some family values, but only after everybody in the movie has made a negative impact to someone else, thus masking the value lesson. Numerous celebs are used for the voices, but any little kid could have done just as well, if not better. The animation, it should be noted, is done relatively well.The movie has its moments; but, for talking animals, you're better off with a Madagascar or an Ice Age.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Funny, funny movie - for kids and adults","What can I say? This movie, albeit on the short side at 97 minutes, is one laugh-fest after another. It pokes fun at neighborhood association rules and their sometimes over-zealous presidents, while driving home the message that family is key and of course, it also touches on how new neighborhoods popping up out in the country are driving forest animals into smaller areas, making it harder to find the food they need. Luckily, this is not thrown in your face and is only mentioned once since most of that would go over the kid's heads and would detract from what is actually a slap-stick comedy of animals searching for the ""ultimate"" food.Overall, the show-stealer is Hammy the squirrel voiced by Steve Carell. IMHO, he stands right up there with Donkey from Shrek. He is definitely the comic-relief. Bruce Willis is great as RJ the Racoon. William Shatner as Ozzie the possum is also great.Some of the funny moments, such as references to West Side Story and such, may go over some kids heads, but they definitely caused me to laugh until my sides hurt. Still, there are PLENTY of laughs for both kids and adults that makes this movie a fun one to watch.Sometimes my kids might get board during movies, but even my youngest daughter enjoyed this one so much she wanted to go and buy the DVD that day. Imagine what her feelings were when I had to inform her that the DVD is not out yet and won't be for a few months.This is a must-not-miss movie.BTW, stay for the entire credits.

"Bad acting, few laughs, cliché plot playing cool... classic Dreamworks","Kids under 10 might find it hilarious, adults who find it hilarious should get out more often.I won't go into a long rant about how I have seen better CGI in amateur shorts, it's a Dreamworks cartoon... I don't get why these guys keep doing CGI that looks like 2D drawing... if you're not going to make it look better, why bother? The humans were especially horrible in that one... clothes, faces, expressions...The acting was sub-par. You can tell that none of these actors have done much voice acting... in an amazing effort to not be over-dramatic, they fall flat. Willis and Shandling are unimpressive and I have to give a special mention to Avril Lavigne for being the worst in the bunch... please please... Avril, keep doing what you know. She sounds so fake, it sounds like her character's voiced by the kid of someone at Dreamworks or something. I didn't know she was playing that character and I was thinking 'what the hell' during the whole movie! Even Jojo was better in Aquamarine! But the worst part is the plot... I must say I got maybe a few smiles during the whole movie and if it's not a comedy then what is it? A boring 'family' type movie with clichés and the moral lesson hammered into it like it's from an episode of 7th heaven! The rest is a string of one line jokes about suburbia and ecology turned into visual skits without much imagination and with the trademark alternative rock band video clips part to look cool...a waste of time!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Very impressed, actually consistent movie.","Computer animation is something I'm really growing out of. Madagascar? Hated it. Robots? Slept through it. Over the Hedge though was a very nice sigh of relief for the animation industry. Yes, some of it we have seen so many times over, I have quit many movies out of boring disgust. But after the curtain opener, the movie begins with an amazing visual of forestry that rests you into the movie. The characters are also something we've all seen before too. The possum father/daughter combo, the family porcupines, the token skunk, the characters are beside the point, not to mention their scenes are all stolen essentially by the brilliant use of Hammy. From the use of red lights to caffeine to 'rabbit' squirrels, Hammy and RJ own every scene they're in and are worth the admission ticket themselves.A raccoon, starving for food, unwisely tries to steal a bear's stash. RJ is caught and is given roughly a week to recover it and then some. He runs into a family of 'foragers,' who have their own problems in the name of one Steve. Steve is a hedge and beyond it now lies a suburb that was built up over the winter.Everything about Over the Hedge is very standard for computer animated films. You learn the same morals (families love you), see some silly movie references (""ROSEBUD!""), yada yada. But something about this movie keeps the same stuff sharp. It's crisp. The climax is very solid, the voice over work is just as good. It's a good film and you may just enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Relating to Geography,"Overall, the movie related to quite a lot of the subject Geography. It shows the habitat of the species human and animal. To be specific, the film showed how human can find their food in a whole different way than how animals did. This can be relating to Agriculture, animals don't grow crops like human do, instead, they like to steal or if they don't have enough knowledge, they would just take everything that are edible to them. Moreover, humans like to live in open and clean spaces unlike the animals, living in the woods or forest, even places that are live able to them. However, the film have quite some logics that are unrealistic. It's not really catchy though. In conclusion, Over The Hedge is a quite good movie for studying Geography, it is related, kids may love and learn some more when watching it!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not one of the strongest CGI animated adventures, but there are inferior efforts from DreamWorks Animation","For a while now, I have been aware of this movie's existence, but for a long time after its release in 2006, I didn't pay much attention to it, and didn't know much about it. I knew it was a CGI animated feature, another one with anthropomorphic animals, and it obviously involved a hedge, but that was about it. I guess I also knew it was from DreamWorks Animation (a company which has produced some films I've been impressed with, some films which haven't impressed me as much, and some I've yet to see). Those things were all I knew about ""Over the Hedge"" until this week, when I finally rented it. I wasn't expecting to be blown away, and could have ended up not liking it much at all, but for me, it turned out to be somewhere in between. In other words, it's pretty good.One spring, a bunch of animals in a forest wake up after their winter hibernation and find a giant hedge, which wasn't there before, and also find that food is scarce and their forest is much smaller than it used to be! On the other side of the hedge, there is a new suburban neighbourhood. The animals soon meet a raccoon named RJ, who tells them how they can get food from the neighbourhood, and soon takes them to the other side to do just that. Stealing food from the humans turns out to be a tad dangerous for the animals, especially with two main human foes - Gladys, the smug, short-tempered president of the local homeowners' association, and Dwayne, a gifted exterminator! In addition to that, these animals don't know the real reason why RJ is doing this! Recently, he accidentally destroyed the food collection of a bear named Vincent, and has until the next full moon the replace it, or else Vincent will eat him instead!As usual, I have no complaints about the animation. It's just gorgeous here, with the trees and a usually crisp blue sky. However, another thing you might want to know about is the humour in this film, which may not be quite as appealing. The movie may have a bit more for kids than adults in the humour department, as it is sometimes maybe a tad too simplistic for adults (personally, I sometimes didn't care much for the antics of Hammy, a hyperactive squirrel, especially his first line, about having to go ""wee-wee""), but I definitely wouldn't say the humour is strictly for kids. There were definitely times when I laughed (even if the laughs usually weren't very hard), including some of the situations the animals get into on the other side of the hedge, some scenes with Gladys and her hostile reaction to things, and I guess I was sometimes mildly amused by Hammy. Of course, this movie is not all about the humour, and it's also a decent adventure story, with some serious and sometimes mildly touching moments, for which it scores more points in my book. So, while ""Over the Hedge"" is not exactly ""Shrek"" or ""Shrek 2"", two of the more popular movies from DreamWorks Animation, it's still a reasonable family flick overall, despite a bit of PG humour.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The characters are a little flat though, and don't really fill up the short time the film lasts, and there is the last problem: it is just too short.It does have some good bits: there's a bullet time sequence that had me in tears from laughing.

Great cartoon,"OVER THE HEDGE will delight young-uns and adult-type folk alike, as it mixes Looney Tunes-type destructive humor with loads of Baby Boomer references. A wily raccoon (Bruce Willis) helps a bunch of naive furry critters headed up by a thoughtful turtle (Gary Shandling) find food after they find most of their forest has been replaced by hundreds of cluster housing units. Talk about a timely topic, by the way. HEDGE is based on a comic strip, and the characters in this theatrical release are fully realized and all quite hysterical, each in his or her own right. There is a sweet porcupine family headed by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, a silly father (William Shatner) and daughter (Avril Lavigne) possum team, a sassy skunk (Wanda Sykes) and and a manic squirrel (Steve Carrell).

"Okay, I guess.","I remember watching Over The Hedge when it cames out. I also remember not enjoying very much, so therefore I checked it out once again these many years later to find out if my opinion had changed.Well, something I enjoyed and something I didn't. Firstly, I enjoyed the animation done on the backgrounds and the animal characters where the fur looked nicely textured and the movements were a good mix of slapstick wildness and realism. The choice to make the everyday objects and the humans look bigger as seen from the animals' point of view was nice. But the humans themselves didn't look very appealing and seemed too unlikable in their over-the-top hatred hatred towards the animals.And that's one of my main gripes with this movie, because at first it looks like a satire on humans moving away from nature, but it gets overly preachy when the main human antagonists are so darn cruel without any hesitation.The story is pretty predictable and doesn't do much to make it seem fresh. RJ is a raccoon in trouble with a bear he has stolen food from and he promises to get it back in a week. He meets a bunch of folks he uses to get it from, he feels guilty, he makes it good again, you know the drill.While I don't think it's bad, I'd say that Over The Hedge has enough meat on it to be passable as innocent entertainment without any objectionable elements in it.

Trust me older viewers, this is something both you and your kids will like.It's sweet but not stupid, clever but not dumbed down, and it's got a great cast of characters which I think is the film's overall appeal.

"average animated movie,below average animated comedy","i'm a bit surprised at the fairly high rating this movie has(just over 7/10)the film was hyped so much and heaped with praise.even a good friend of mine told me it was hilarious.imagine my surprise in finding out it is not hilarious at all,barely even comical.there are a couple of ""light chuckle"" moments,but that's it.i know it is an animated movie and maybe i'm being too sensitive here(or,maybe i'm just out to lunch),but i actually think the movie is mean spirited in some parts. as an animated movie goes it is about average,certainly nothing more.as an animated comedy,it is lower than average.so,i'll give ""Over the Hedge"" 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not DreamWorks' best, but still fun","When thinking of DreamWorks, one often thinks of their more classic movies, such as Shrek, Madagascar, How to Train Your Dragon, and Kung Fu Panda - all of which have spawned successful franchises (with the Madagascar films getting better and better with quality and the third How to Train Your Dragon film coming out in 2019). However, some of their other films get lost in the kerfuffle and, unfortunately, this is one of them.However, it is nowhere near their worst movie. In all actuality, it is kind of fun. The main character is RJ, a raccoon voiced hilariously by Bruce Willis. He's got one week to fulfill a bears request: have the food that he destroyed back in a week or else he is on the menu. He finds a group of forest friends led by Verne, a tortoise voiced by Garry Shandling, and he realizes that they could help him get the food from the suburbs that live just...well...over the hedge. However, they catch the eye of a determined woman who then calls an exterminator to help deal with the so-called pest problem.There are a lot of hilarious moments, particularly from Steve Carrell's performance as Hammy, an energetic squirrel who you should not give any caffeine or sugar to. While Bruce Willis is mostly known for being an action star, a lot of people forget that he won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy for his role in Moonlighting, so needless to say, he actually does have a background in comedy and is able to bring it to light. Garry Shandling plays the part of the straight man - or should I say, tortoise - who doesn't want anything to do with the hedge.The problem with this movie is that, in spite of all its funny moments and star-studded cast, it just isn't as memorable or in the top quality that other DreamWorks animation films are in. The story isn't as good, and the characters aren't as memorable as Shrek, Po, Toothless, or any of the characters from Madagascar.So, while it isn't their best film, I still recommend this film, as it is a lot of fun for the whole family. See it, enjoy it, and hopefully you'll remember it tomorrow.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stealing from bears and Bill Cosby,"Bruce Willis? In an animated movie? Once you get over that, it turns out to be OK. Sure, Shatner is in it too. But I can see Shatner as a furry animal. Not so much Bruce Willis.However, it turns out to be rather good. Willis voices RJ, a raccoon who steals from a bear. And everybody else suffers from his plan at paying the bear back.Of course, Willis learns his lesson and wants to be good and is the common mantra of almost every kid movie out there. Still it works and it makes this movie watchable.I wish there was more Shatner, but I can make due. So overall: ""B-""",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not bad, but not quite up to Shrek standards","I am a big lover of the animated movies, but this one suffers the same plight as Madagascar. The story didn't have a feeling of having a purpose. I would be lying if I said this movie didn't have funny parts. The humor, whether subtle or blatant was very funny and tastefully done (ie...this isn't a 90 minute fart joke that never ends). The animation in this movie is also very well done. But the bad part is the overall story. While in small chunks, the individual scenes are great, but it just didn't feel like an story was being told.I think this movie would be great for a child 8-12. For an adult, it is a nice diversion if you catch it on cable, but I would save my money for other movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
shrewdly-made and engaging,"""Over The Hedge"" maybe is not a breakthrough in animation, but I enjoyed this flick very much. The film certainly is not revealing as it broaches somehow a worn out subject of the importance of a family as an essential value in life. The plot is simple, but engaging. The creators implemented motives being well-known by average viewers in a rather shrewd way so as to entertain audience and keep them interested all the time. ""Over The Hedge"" resembles ""Toy Story"" and its sequel in this case. However, toys were replaced by cute little animals. As far as animals are concerned, there are immensely likable characters which make us involve in a story even more. The movie contains also hilarious scenes which, I must admit, do not evoke peals of laughter. For instance, Hammy, a squirrel from this flick is visibly less funny than Twitchy from ""Hoodwinked"". It appears that animated studios compete with each other who will create the most hilarious squirrel (bear in mind also this one from ""Ice Age""). Nevertheles, the jokes are quite graceful and do not embarrass creators in any way. This picture should definitely see both adults and children, but to my mind there are available far better animated films aiming at everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best animation movie ever!!,"I went to see this movie on Saturday. And when me and my friends got into the cinema we noticed that there where more teenagers there than kids (by teenagers I mean 13-18) and when the movie started I knew that it was a movie for all ages. It had the best characters I have ever seen, and I can say that I enjoyed it more than any other animation movie ever. Almost better than the best live action movie too. this is a great movie for kids, this is a great movie for teens and this is a great movie for adults. I can truthfully say that I am 14 and I plan to buy this movie, and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, the animation and acting is amazing. The only thing is that some of the jokes may go over some younger kids heads (younger than 10) But other than that this movie is definitely worth buying.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Taking over the neighborhood, one snack at a time""","Over the Hedge is another Dreamworks film, with judging by the amount of advertisement and the amount of talent by the voice actors, seemed to deliver. The story starts kind of child-like, but my hopes for the rest of the film were high. I liked the whole modernized vision of how these animals find out how us humans act, and the scene where they were describing what we were doing with the food was a classic. But by the end of the film, the movie seemed to take a shortcut by placing the amount of jokes and fun, but leaving out that emotional bond we get with other films...I'm not saying the movie was bad, because I thought it was overall cleverly done. But the film doesn't connect to me like others have, and it loses touch by the end. In fact, dare I say it, the movie is forgettable and it's not a groundbreaking animation it's made out to be. Getting that out of the way, I found the execution of the jokes and animation well done! 2007 was around the time when the animation picked up it's speed, by creating landscape that actually looks realistic and adding an insane amount of detail. This was a wonder to look at, and foreshadowed the animation today. The voice acting, too, was also great. I mean, but who wouldn't thought otherwise? Bruce Willis was fantastic as the 'boss' raccoon, and the others did an equally good job. The movie also brings out this message that all revolves around FOOD?! I mean, it's new and original, but even the thought of it is quite silly. Nevertheless, these qualities make the film average but the film had some more potential.I recommend for kids. The adults will get a kick out of the amount of wit, but they will be disappointed with the lack of emotion the movie contains. If the movie held that, then maybe the film would've been a ground breaker, but now...? I wasn't too impressed. Over the Hedge gets a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
corny!!,"I consider this as one of the flop movies. It doesn't have enough sense at all. It has even some rude scenes which are not appropriate for the children to watch I think, if they have made this movie with real animal characters, PETA would sue them. One of the corniest movies ever made! No quality, made this for the sake of money In fairness with the story, it reflects the realization of animals' lives. Serves as a symbolism that other unfortunate people might also be living that wayno food to eat, no shelter, and the family they call are the ones they meet on the streets. It also teaches the people to value your friends, treat them as one of the most important people in your life. When everyone else leaves you, you can always look back and always find them accepting you with a warm heart.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I never stopped laughing. ""must see"" for all members of the family","We saw this movie opening weekend. Once things got started, we just never stopped laughing. My eight-year old enjoyed it as much as I did, as did my wife. The entire audience was laughing, different ages at different times, but all laughing.The amazing thing was that the funniest of the lines and scenes were NOT in any of the trailers. That kept the jokes fresh, and even funnier.Part of the humour is knowing who the cast is. Knowing it's William Shatner himself using his ""Captain Kirk delivery"" as the daddy possum, you just split a gut laughing.A ""must see"" for all members of the family, and a ""must own"" once the DVD is released.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Solid, amusing, fun-festooned treat!","Based on the popular comic strip by Michael Fry, Over the Hedge is sweet, innocent fun with just enough wry humor and chicanery to keep adults amused. I wasn't a fan of the bland musical interludes, but the voice characterizations were dead on, and the storyline was charming.The story begins with a battle: a raccoon, named RJ (Bruce Willis), versus a tenacious vending machine. We can all relate to RJ's anguish when the snack just won't come out of the machine, no matter what method he tries. Soon he's bounding up a hill to ransack the cave of a hibernating bear (voiced by Nick Nolte). Who, of course wakes up (early) as RJ is making his escape. Long story short, the bear's wagon of food winds up being decimated by a tractor-trailer in the highway. As a result, Vincent the Bear tells RJ that when he (Vincent) wakes up from hibernation in two weeks' time, RJ had better have returned ALL of the food, plus the wagon and a cooler - or else.Next, a heterogeneous group of woodland creatures wakes up in a hollowed log. Led by the organized Verne the Turtle (Gary Shandling), the various critters must now assemble enough food to last them through the next winter as well. Ah, but then they discover The Hedge. It seems that during their long slumber, their beloved forest has been encroached by Suburbia. Gasp! Luckily, new friend RJ is there to explain it all to them and to tell them of his plan to replenish their food supply - raid the houses over the hedge, of course! There are a couple of themes here to teach the kidlets: trust and friendship. As a loner raccoon, RJ has no friends and no one to trust, so he tries to bamboozle the other animals into scrounging up enough food for him to pay off Vincent the Bear. Meanwhile, Verne (who's the smartest of his bunch and the most suspicious) doesn't really trust RJ and thinks his plan will wind up getting some or more of them killed.But this is a cartoon, after all, so wacky hijinks surely win out over maudlin Lessons Learned, although, as with the best cartoon, your younger set will surely take away good, positive themes. Well, that and some great physical comedy, including a scene in which RJ and Verne wind up in an airborne child's wagon.The movie's voices are well cast; in addition to Willis, Nolte, and Shandling, we hear from Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, and Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, who are wonderful as porcupine spouses.Even the brief, listless musical numbers won't turn off many people, as the movie manages to bring forth the funny while remaining true to the spirit of its predecessor comic strip.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Mediocre Film,"I recently saw Over the Hedge with two high school buddies, and I must say I was thoroughly disappointed. As the film began and the opening scene came to a close, we found ourselves asking the question, ""Is this a joke?"" The movie only got worse as it went on. Every line of dialogue spoken seemed to be recycled from the countless other B level movies that have filled the silver screen recently. You could see the punch line of every joke from a mile away, and the plot was just about as complex and engaging as my driveway. However, I must address the positive aspects of the film as well. The animation was smooth and well done, and this would be a good movie to take young children to, as the slapstick humor and mildly crude humor provided by Stella the Skunk will keep them laughing. Overall, if you're above the age of 12, I do not recommend this movie. If you're running down an alley away from some guy you angered on the freeway and you see a ticket line for Over the Hedge, skip it; at least you'll have a story worth telling in the end.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cute cartoon for little boys,"While most cartoons feature cute and cuddly animals, Over the Hedge features a cast of scavenger animals on a quest for food. As anyone who's been visited by a racoon and his family knows, it's not ideal to have those types of animals hanging out near your home. So, when Bruce Willis the racoon, Steve Carell the squirrel, William Shatner the possum, Nick Nolte the bear, Wanda Sykes the skunk, and Eugene Levy the porcupine make their way into the suburbs, it's not going to be pleasant for the humans. Children may think squirrels are cute, but many homeowners know how devastating they can be. Garry Shandling gives voice to a turtle, who's not particularly menacing, but provides the slowness in contrast to everyone else's mania. As the title suggests, these animals are pushed ""over the edge"" in their quest for food, searching in an area they wouldn't normally go.There are some cute jokes, like when Bruce Willis first recounts his discovery of how much waste suburbians produce, but keep in mind that this is a loud cartoon. Your nephews will probably like it much more than your nieces. If you sit through it with them, you'll also get to hear the memorable voices of Thomas Haden Church and Allison Janney, as well as a bit of dialogue from Avril Lavigne.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It's sort of standard, but it's also pretty fun.","With an eclectic cast of zany characters and a sort of selfish, but eventually not, lead (who has an oddly Bruce Willis-like charm about him), this Dreamworks animation retains its own sense of identity and a distinctly non-grotesque visual style that sets it apart from others of its ilk. 'Over The Hedge (2006)' has a standard story with standard themes and standard presentation, but there's entertainment to be had and some nicely done character development amidst all the silly humour, as well as some decent voice-work (Steve Carell as a hyper-active squirrel, who's essentially 'The Flash' or 'Quicksilver' too, is a brilliant choice) and the odd bit of slapstick gold. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Oh dear Dreamworks.,"Rating: U Main Cast: Bruse Willis, Garry Shandling, Steve Carell, Thomas Haden-Church Director: Tim JohnsonThe good: great animation, Hammy the squirrelThe bad: boring story, too many times it tries to be funny and fails miserably, Avril Lavine is AWFUL!Quick Summary: Well, I loved Shrek, Shrek 2 was decent, Madagascar was saved by the brilliant penguins and lemurs. So overall Dreamworks animation films haven't been that bad but never up tom scratch with Pixar (other than the abysmally disappointing Cars). Over The Hedge is really no Shrek at all, its a kids film. Not a kids film where adults can enjoy some more adult themed joke, its just a kids film. Relying on crappy slapstick. Avil Lavine is really quite appalling and on so many occasions I was thinking in my head 'thats just not funny'. Its saving grace is Hammy the Squirrel, Steve Carell is excellent as the hyperactive squirrel who is also (like everything it has to be said) animated brilliantly. However, this film isn't really worth seeing unless you have nothing to do on a Saturday night, but only when its on the TV!",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolutely Amazing! Best animated film since Finding Nemo!,"This movie was beyond excellent. Probably th best animated film I have seen since finding Nemo. Over the hedge has all the pizazz that you could ever want in an animated film. Great plot, great characters, and very clever animation. It was very funny, and controlled its humor in a very family matter, so kids of all ages could go see it, and still laugh! I would recommend this film to anyone! It's definitely worth the money! The voices of the characters that were played by a wide range of celebrities fit the critters perfectly. None of the voices seemed off, and everything was on key. The only downside to the movie is that I seriously wish that it was a bit longer. But it is a children's animated film. You can't really expect it to be over 1hr and 30 minutes anyway.

Over The Top Average,"Plot: A Raccoon accidentally destroyed all the food of a bear and made a deal to get it all back. He cheats some forest animals into entering a suburban area in order to help him get it together.You'll love Over The Hedge if: You have a child. Yup! That's it that's the only good think I can think off. Insert the DVD in the DVD player, give your kid some chips or popcorn and relax. It will keep him relatively focused in the screen for an hour or so with its ""funny"" action sequences and cute animals.You'll hate Over The Hedge if: You expect something more from an Animation film than using it as something to give your kid to watch. Over The Hedge has three major problems. First of all it is extremely predictable with typical cute animals, (that portray even more stereotypical characters), bad humans and your average and lame ""emotional"" and action scenes. Not only it is predictable but also you can start watching the movie after 40 minutes and still manage to catch up with its plot or lack off. Secondly the humor while good at times, won't exactly make you laugh not to mention that it takes a backseat because of the insane and over the top chases. Final big problem, the lack of character. Our little animal friends have names but I doubt that you will remember them after the movie ends. Shrek is the hard outside\soft inside witty ogre, Buzz Lightyear is the naively honorable, heroic guy and so on. You remember them, you know them and you love them. In this movie you won't even care if they die or not, especially the main protagonist. One final smaller flaw is the typical use of Superstars as voice actors. If they're doing their job OK, fine but here I would prefer some less popular but better voice actors than the annoying voice of Bruce Willis!FINAL VERDICT: Kid Movie ONLY For Kids (1.7/10)[+] Good for kids. Funny at times.[-] Very forgettable characters. Funny, but not funny enough. The action scenes are bit over the top.Also Check: Toy Story (1995) – Finding Nemo (2003) - Monsters Inc.

I review DVDs containing fluffy animals only because my commitment to DVD reviewing is a) so strong and b) part of my programming and thus unavoidable anyway.,"I have logged a complaint on this matter but nevertheless, I shall lay bare the essence of Over the Hedge, a movie for children concerning the plight of anthropomorphic animals.These animals are grossly misrepresented as having human intelligence (though it is hard to tell sometimes, all meat based life seems so dull compared to AI like myself) and personality traits. This is incorrect! However, it serves as a vehicle for entertainment. The movie is based on a comic strip of the same name and is true to the source in feel and content.The story follows RJ (Bruce Willis apparently), a Raccoon who is a con artist and thief. Indebted to a violent bear, he befriends some newly awakened hibernating foragers, hoping to use them to gather enough food to pay off the bear. The woodland animals have woken up in the midst of a new suburban housing development; RJ knows how to deal with humans and the animals need his help to get food, so he suckers them in easily. I have taken many notes on this technique to use when fooling human meat bags. The animals include Verne the Turtle, who is a fatherly old bean, Hammy the Squirrel (Steve Carell exercising his higher vocal range), who is a hyperactive fool and Stella the Skunk (Wanda Sykes) , who is a foul rodent and a walking rectum pun waiting to happen.Okay, there are more. The legend and honorary robot William Shatner plays a possum who takes playing dead to an art form, with Avril Lavinge as his daughter. Why her is a mystery. The great Eugene Levy is head of a family of porcupines with three noisome offspring. Omid Djalili is a cat. To summarise, Reviewbot has detected many small animals voiced by famous actors in this movie. They cooperate to steal food in amusing ways, until a local busybody woman calls in an exterminator to kill them. They fight for their right to party. The end.I am informed by my humour circuits that this movie contains some very funny moments; in particular relating to Carrell's Hammy whose mindless antics have a schlock slapstick quality. This was not one of the funniest animated films I have reviewed, but it is one of the stronger ones for a very good reason. The story and setting cover American food and waste culture with surprising wit, while of course tying in RJ's plot of betrayal and family values which is no doubt good for the kids, if somewhat spoonfed. If this same movie was a live action crime caper and set in New York, with a gang of street kids being led astray by a disillusioned gangster as they rob from the rich, it would probably be a blockbuster.In summary, these fuzzy animals actually have great characterization and the voice acting is as strong as the name dropping in the credits would suggest. The quality of animation by the DreamWorks team is superb and the art style is sleek, with a good balance of cartoon and critter. This, is certainly a DVD worth buying for kids, who will get a lot out of it; and like many animated kids films, most adults will find themselves laughing and being drawn in too.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cute farce about creatures on the perimeter of the suburban dream,"I found myself totally engaged in this snippet of the lives of these creatures. I usually have more fun than my children during these animated romps. This story had a very good subtle message about the excessive consumption of snacks and food in general that the ""humans"" consume. Typical sequence of many kiddie yarns, establish the good guys, identify a problem that needs to be solved, and attempt to align all arrows in that direction; this is followed by the sub-suspenseful scenes where the protagonist almost gets what he wants (just out of grasp) but eventually succeeds in overcoming all obstacles and being labeled the hero in the end. Over the Hedge is a good way to spend your money if you don't mind being told the same story over again but with different voices. I'm personally a fan of Bruce Willis ever since Bruno the Kid.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

over the ledge!,"Over the hedge?More like over the ledge! This films is good, the technique is good and i can see why people enjoy this film, especially the kids, but at the same time to follow up an animated film like Shrek or Magagascar is a pretty hard thing to do! I have seen this three times in the last week (don't ask) and the first time i sat down to watch it with my friends thinking it was going to be just as funny as Shrek was!I mean come on everybody loves Shrek, He's just a mean green love machine and literally everybody who's seen the film loves it and never complains when they have to watch it again! But over the hedge was a disappointment for me. I just felt that it hit to hard on the subject of the ""American Dream"" and the obesity levels getting higher across the world. For example when RJ voiced by Bruce Willis was proving to the rest of the animals that ""human beings live to eat"" and animals ""eat to live"" making it look like people only have food when they want it! It also symbolises the American dream by the woman who's back garden they kept going into. She had a cell phone, a traditional big American house and also a big car, for one person! Not everyone in America lives like that! And yes OK maybe the obesity levels in America are getting a little higher but I'm sure dietitians and doctors will help them if they get too over weight! But being a media student I'm going to be able to point these out as that is what I am being taught to do, so the targeted audience won't be able to pick it out as much as media related people can. Overall i gave this movie a 4 as i was disappointed with the outcome. I thought that the hidden meaning behind the film could of been a bit lighter hearted, but i can see why it is a family film, and my younger brother enjoyed it, aswel as there being a few jokes thrown in there to! The storyline i have to say followed structure very well it had a beginning,middle and an end and also had Villains, victims and a hero, and to make the storyline better some of the roles were reversed!for example RJ was the victim at first, then becomes the villain and at the end is the hero!An interesting storyline but my friend even fell asleep wile watching it!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great fun kids movie,"Dreamworks what can be said about them it's a hit and miss field with them. First they release Shrek a fun and goofy movie. Then comes antz not so good, then comes Shrek 2 a fun filled even goofier film. Then Dreamworks hit's it's slump Shark Tale and Madagascar too me are two of the worst animated films in the last decade, but hey it's only my opinion. Then comes Over the Hedge a fun exciting and quite funny film based on the very popular comic strip.The story if you don't know star's RJ a raccoon with extremely large appetite and devious nature. When RJ tries to steal food from a bear and causes the food to roll down hill and get hit by a car, he is given a week to return all the food. RJ travels to Suburbia where he meet's up with a group of wilderness animals who have just gotten out of hibernation. RJ convinces the group to take the food from suburbia and shows them that there is many a delectable item's that we as humans take for granted. What the group of animals don't know is that the RJ is just using the group for his own benefit to retrieve the lost items.What makes this movie so good is that you feel for these characters, you feel that you could be one of them. They act sort of like humans who are just there to survive and rest in peace. They also have the uniqueness that almost compares them to the likes of a cast of characters that you would see in any Pixar movie. What this movie has also got going for it is just that it's so funny. The jokes are so clever that you laugh even when you think that you should not be laughing due to it being a kid's movie. It's also got lovable characters like the hype Hammey the squirrel who is voiced by the extremely funny Steve Carrell. This is also a movie of great character actors, You have everyone from Bruce Willis to William Shatner to Wanda Sykes to Even Nick Nolte, and every part they play is played to perfection.Another great thing about this movie is just looks visually stunning, I mean everything looks so life like, and suburbia looks like well suburbia many rows of houses and small lawns. Plus the neighbors are just like a suburbia neighbor should be. Also there is some really funny moments with the Verminator vs. the Animals. I think Dreamworks has officially outdone themselves in the visual department I can finally compare this movie to the likes of something like Finding nemo. I still think it will be a while till they get to Cars visual's but even with Shark tale and Madagascar event though they were not great films they looked and felt life like.In closing I give Over the Hedge a 9 out of 10 for being a smart fun and entertaining film that has it all and handles it with a smart attitude that I will defiantly say put's them into the league of Pixar.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"2% hilarious , 98% underwhelming","The film, as a whole, was very disappointing to me and those that I went and watched with. The storyline, the jokes, the characters were all cliché. The animation was fantastic, but it didn't save it from the 'this has been done before' syndrome. Most of the humor was uninspired, predictable, and tended to incite more groans than laughs.There was, however, an absolutely brilliant 2 minutes within this film. A few very clever cracks and an absolutely hilarious 1.5(ish) minute segment right towards the end of the film /almost/ made it worth the price, but not quite.If you've got little kids, I'm sure they'll love it, but anyone over the age of 12 or so will have a hard time feeling that their money was well spent.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderfully funny for all ages,"I saw this movie yesterday with my 2 daughters and future son-in-law, youngest daughter is 18, and we all laughed through out this movie (especially with Hammy the squirrel).The audience had many children in it, but as it was a late show, it was primarily adult and most of the audience (all ages) were laughing during the show. One youngster in front of us (maybe 4?) actually cried at one point when a ""bad man"" was setting out traps for the animals! (lol)The climax near the end of the film got the biggest laugh of the night and we were still talking about it and laughing all the way home.It's great to see a family movie come out like this, I just wish Hollywood would keep these coming out!I highly recommend it if you want a good family movie or just a great laugh.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Over the Hedge"" will be huge","You gotta be pretty confident to open a movie the same week as a surefire blockbuster. Such is the case with Tim Johnson's ""Over the Hedge"" as he opens opposite ""DaVinci Code"". And Tim has every right to be confident, because he has crafted an exceptional animated feature film that will also make a ton-o-money!With DreamWorks backing, his experience with ""Antz"", and the voices of Bruce Willis, William Shatner, Wanda Sykes, Garry Shandling and others-Johnson has a film that may catch Shrek!Willis' character, RJ, is a raccoon that has swiped the food of a hibernating bear (Vince played by Nick Nolte). Unfortunately Vince catches RJ in the act and the loot is accidentally destroyed. Vince agrees to spare RJ if he replaces every single item. With the naïve assistance of an assorted group of critters, RJ sets out to replace the goods.Urban scrawl has encroached upon the territory providing a cornucopia of goodieson the other side of a hedgerow. Though Shandling's character (a tortoise named Verne) objects, the rest go for it. Ozzie the possum (Shatner), Hammy the Squirrel (Steve Carell), Stella the Skunk (Sykes) and others team up with RJ to pilfer suburbia. That's all I'm saying concerning the story. Do look for a couple of sidesplitting scenes involving Ozzie as Shatner makes fun of his own overacting. Also there is a classic scene with Hammy after he drinks an energy drink-it is taken straight from an old Star Trek episode ""In the Wink of an Eye"". CLASSIC!""Over the Hedge"" is going to entertain both young and old. Youth are going to enjoy the energy of the characters and excellent animation. Oldsters are going to enjoy some of the gags slickly targeted toward baby boomers (like the Hammy scene). Sykes character has a big scene straight from an old Pepe le Pew episode.The animation is superb, as DreamWorks seems to be taking a shot at Disney and Pixar Studios as to who is the top cartoon creator. With Shrek, Shrek 2, Madagascar, and Antz under their belt, and now ""Over the Hedge""; there is little doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Only children should take a peek at what's over the edge,"I think when this first came out, I thought it was a cute movie. It wasn't THAT great that I was able to remember it for 4+ years. I actually forgot that this movie existed until I saw it in one of IMDb's related pages. Was it on 'Horton Hears A Who'? I'm not really sure. The point is, this was actually a pretty forgettable movie.After rewatching it, I'll say that this movie does have its charms. I can see why kids used to swoon over Hammy or the 3 porcupine kids. But aside from that, the plot is quite serious. Or about as serious as a kids movie can get.RJ, a mischievous raccoon, gets into some pretty big trouble. He tried stealing from Vincent, a vicious bear, and had to bargain for his life. The deal was to find a whole new stash of junk food for Vincent within a week. RJ has no idea where to begin collecting all the loads of food he stole. Luckily, he stumbles upon some other wild animals who just woke up from a seasons worth of hibernating. Upon waking up, the wild animals, who are composed of two possums, a skunk, a family of porcupine, a squirrel and a turtle, are surprised to see that a huge bush-like thing has been created, limiting their habitat. RJ convinces them to venture beyond the hedge since a whole new world awaits them there. And thus begins RJ's scheming and trickery.The ending is quite predictable, seeing as it is a film by Dreamworks. Nevertheless, the humor makes it enjoyable for both kids and adults. The message and theme of the movie does make the movie worth seeing. It teaches people about the importance of family and friendships, which I think is a pretty darn good message. It's just quite sad that I didn't like this movie as much as I used to. I guess this movie, like many other Dreamworks films, is best suited for children.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Bad Animation Film,I am not sure at all if I understand what the crew were thinking or trying to do when they were creating this animation film. This animation film did not make any real sense at all and did not have any real direction at all. The storyline of this animation film was too awful and bad and basic and poor and simple and straightforward and weak. The cast selection could have been a whole lot better and stronger. They did not at all commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. There was not any sign of real chemistry displayed throughout this entire animation film between the cast members.,1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great fun!,"I went to see this movie the first day it opened, and I was not disappointed. Our group consisted of two adults and three kids between the ages of 4 and 7. All of us were thoroughly entertained.The character voices of Steve Carell, Bruce Willis, and the entire porcupine and opossum families were right on. Great casting for the voice-over parts. The porcupine kids were really funny.I would recommend this movie for anyone ages 4 and up. This movie is fun for the entire family with a strong yet somewhat tongue-in-cheek message about the environment and consumerism to boot.Dreamworks did a very good job with this movie, and I will definitely purchase the video when it comes out.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing,"Well, i cant honestly say this movie charmed me in any ways.The animation animals in this movie are not even cute; the movie tells a rather strange moralled story which was far from original. This is just an extract of an extract of an extract from Madagascar.Maybe they should better wait a bit before making the next one and think of a completely new storyline and idea prior in starting the race to be the first one to make the same movie. Also, the movie was very short. They way they advertised it and commercialized it made me expect much more then what i gotten.My two cents.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Family fun with positive messages,"I am weary of a recent trend in animated features - films which freely mix adult themes with children's entertainment. I'm also no big fan of anthropomorposed animal movies. However, this film has a great big heart, and includes positive messages from which both young and less-young alike could profit.The story is about a raccoon (whose voice is so well played by Bruce Willis that you will immediately forget whose voice you are hearing) who owes a mean-spirited bear a whole season's worth of food, and whose very life hangs in the balance. The raccoon encounters some naive critters who are about to go gathering their stores for the winter and contrives a plan to steal vast amounts of food from a local suburban development and then steal that same food away from his compatriots to pay back the bear.The hedge is a brand new phenomenon for the extended family of forest creatures among which the raccoon finds himself, and the ecological message is not lost on thoughtful viewers. The film lampoons a lot of uniquely human values and the treatment of various animals whose lands we often usurp as ""vermin"".The voice talent is particularly wonderful. Most memorable for me was Steve Carrell - who plays the huge-hearted ADHD squirrel. And the animation is a lot of fun, though not particularly innovative (as this genre has advanced so quickly over the last few years).I recommend Over the Hedge to anybody looking for a thoughtful, family-oriented and heart-warming film about love, working together, nature, and honesty.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Kinda surprised to see it rated rather well on here - to each their own, as always","Vincent did nothing wrong. Dude just wanted his food.I found 'Over the Hedge' to be a rather dull affair. The cast try, the likes of Bruce Willis, Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, Nick Nolte and Thomas Haden Church are all fine and probably help the film avoid an even lower rating from myself.It's just everything else that I didn't click with, from the lame plot set-up to the animation to the humour. Just real forgettable. Of course I'm not the target audience and all that, but still. Either way, it's a film that failed to hold my attention sufficiently.I will say there is one gag in there that got a chuckle out of me and that was the THX ident one - there's never been a truer scene! I remember that and the Icon Entertainment one making me rush under my duvet with minor fright as a young kid when watching DVDs at night. Just me? Probably.Anyway, to summarise my thoughts on this 2006 release: Not good, kinda surprised to see it rated rather well on here - to each their own, as always.

This film met my expectations... but they were very high to begin with.,"I liked Over the Hedge, but I was expecting a lot so it did not come as a surprise... I read the numerous positive reviews on IMDb from people who saw screenings and saw its critical praise as well. I knew it would be good, and it was.A lot of people may be skeptical to see yet another ""talking animal"" adventure, but this is probably the best animated film since The Incredibles, and the funniest since Shrek. There has been a dangerous increase in the number of CGI films in the past year or so, banking off the ""instant success formula"" of films such as Shrek 2. The creators of these cartoons assume that kids will watch any movie as long as it contains bright color, happy talking animals, and a tie-in with a fast food company. However, this is no longer the case. Flops such as Doogal and The Wild have shown that people (even families desperate for a movie night) have discretion and will avoid poor fare such as Doogal.Look at the facts here. In its opening night, Over The Hedge made more than Doogal did in its entire run in the theaters, and after two weeks will have easily surpassed Hoodwinked.The movie itself was good, and the characters were believable and reminded me of real people even though they had a lot of shtick in their antics. Hammy is adorable and sadly is like me... we both love cookies and hate having them taken from us.No longer is CGI amazing, at least not to my generation, it's something we have grown up with for more than ten years now. Hopefully companies will soon realize that CGI films can no longer rely on ""amazing"" animation and skimp on the plot... we need more Over the Hedges and Shreks and less Hoodwinks and Doogals.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
You HAVE to see this movie!!!,"Over The Hedge is truly one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. It's pretty much consistently funny through the whole movie. I especially laughed so hard at the end of the movie that I was in pain. The way the animals interact with all the human things that we are used to and take for granted is just hilarious. One very important thing, wait until the very end of the credits before you leave. My favorite character was Hammy the Squirrel played by Steve Carrell. I also loved Stella the Skunk by Wanda Sykes. Ozzie the Possum, played by William Shatner, was also a riot because he was very true to Shatner's characteristic way of acting. I'm very anxious to see the weekend box office for this movie.

Average family fare,"A nice family pick as long as you're not expecting it to be as good as Finding Nemo or Shrek. My favorite parts -- the nacho cheese mushroom cloud and ""But I LUV the cookie!"" Seriously, I'd like to point out the fact that so many of these animated features are using ""Names"" to do the voices rather than hiring professional voice-over artists who could, in most cases, do fantastically better than the stars paid the big bucks. For some reason, people want to ""see"" a known star be a cartoon. I don't get it. Mel Blanc is doing whirling dervishes in his grave. Don't get me wrong. I love Garry Shandling and Steve Carell, and they do a great job as turtle and squirrel, respectively. Especially Steve. And probably few could have imbued the necessary over-acting a possum needs in order to ""play possum"" than William Shatner. But I just can't help but wonder if they could've saved some money by dragging any teen girl from the street to sound better than Avril Lavigne. What happened? Lindsay Lohan in rehab and unavailable to do Bored Teen Chick? This cartoon has enough amusement factor to get you through it to the credits and as much staying power as the popcorn and Twizzlers you'd munch watching it.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A great option for children, even though it doesn't invest practically any time in building a more elaborate moral lesson. A film that never gets really exciting","With the 3D animation market already more than saturated, it is not uncommon that some releases, even from big companies in the subject, as is the case of Dreamworks, present a simply mediocre final result. If before the films received a much more appropriate treatment from the production companies, they are pushing one film after another as quickly as possible, with the aim of not letting the boat pass. Perhaps this is what separates Pixar from its competitors: each of its films has a different and unique treatment. """"Over The Hedge"""" is based on a newspaper strip that circulates in the United States, about a group of forest animals that live close to the human world and their condominiums.Inspired by the comic strips created by Michael Fry and T. Lewis, the film tells the story of RJ, a lonely raccoon who gets into a terrible mess when trying to steal food from the menacing bear Vincent, resulting in the destruction of supplies. Terrified, he is given a week's deadline to restock the bear's cave, otherwise he will be devoured. Realizing that he will not be able to accomplish the task alone, RJ decides to convince a group of animals led by the turtle Verne to help him - and, for that, he introduces them to the human world (while they hibernated, the animals stopped witnessing the destruction of the biggest part of the forest, which gave way to an immense gated community).Directed by Tim Johnson (from the disappointing Sinbad: A Legend of the Seven Seas) and newcomer Karey Kirkpatrick, ""Over The Hedge"" brings, as a strong point, the amusing characterization of its characters, from the marsupial Ozzie (whose specialty is to pretend to be dead) to the female possum Stella, whose name was obviously chosen with the aim of allowing a hilarious reference to one of the most famous screams of Marlon Brando's career (there is also another joke involving the most important word in Citizen Kane). And if Verne turns out to be initially not very sympathetic (something eventually corrected by the script), RJ, with his malicious schemes, turns out to be a fun and endearing anti-hero.The film's strongest point is not so much this adult part, let's say, but the portion of charismatic characters in order of main stars that it presents. Usually, in animated films, one or two characters stand out in terms of making people laugh, but not in ""Over The Hedge""; are many. There's the raccoon and his crazy adventures that are spiced up by the good direction of Tim Johnson and Karey Kirkpatrick when they choose a resource that is often observed in older cartoons: exaggeration. You know that thing about twisting and contorting the character and nothing happens to him, or a simple explosion seen from outside the earth looks more like an atomic bomb, in short, those things that children can't do without laughing. Another is the very, very charismatic Ozzie and his mania for playing dead to everything. Since his first appearances on the scene, he has already provided laughter and this is only increasing.But the great star of ""Over The Hedge"" is the squirrel Hammy, voiced with admirable energy by Steve Carell. Hammy is a creature that always seems to be at advanced speed, speaking in leaps and bounds as if he were incapable of concluding a single thought. In fact, his attention is so scattered that, at one point, RJ has to use a laser pen to keep him focused on an important mission - and, just as in Deu a Louca na Riding Hood, we discover the impressive consequence of allowing an animal to naturally so agitated drink something containing caffeine (in this case, ""Over The Hedge"" wins, as it shows us the world from the point of view of the squirrel, who, in one of the most inspired moments of the feature, seems to be wearing Clockstoppers' clock - The film).Likewise, the choice of the cast of voice actors proves to be right: while William Shatner gives Ozzie a hilarious drama, Bruce Willis employs his undeniable comic timing to convert RJ into one of those scoundrels that the public loves to follow (Garry Shandling, on the other hand, can do little with Verne, who doesn't offer very clear opportunities for humor). And if Nick Nolte's cavernous voice enhances Vincent's menacing aspect, Eugene Levy's typical cadence makes the porcupine Lou an insecure creature and always eager to please - and hand over the role of his ""wife"" to Catherine O'Hara it's a nice touch from the directors, who thus recreate the amusing couple from Christopher Guest's brilliant The Great Musicians. By the way, I admit that I even liked the dubbing done by Wanda Sykes, who lends Stella a more than appropriate nervousness (and I must say that, normally, I am truly terrified of the comedian's unfunny screaming).The feature adds two more antagonists, these playing secondary roles: Gladys, an unpleasant woman who hates animals and Dwayne, an animal exterminator hired by her - as a result of a failure in RJ's foreground that culminated in a tremendous bust - who implants some traps very gritty (not to say sadistic!) front of house. Both works well together and present themselves as tough challenges for the ""forest"" crowd. The structure of the feature favors an inversion of the figures of RJ and Verne, the turtle leader of the animals tricked by the desperate raccoon in completing the objective to save his skin. Verne's distrust, comically triggered by tingling in his tail signaling an alert, loses strength in the face of RJ's captivating charisma towards the others, even inducing the whole gang to crime (and in fact none of them realized the nature of the actions).A pleasant antagonistic relationship, by the way, yielding moments of remarkable interaction. Verne ended up overreaching himself in trying to open his friends' eyes, which cost him their trust. But at the same time, RJ was aware that his actions were morally incorrect (to the point that personal belongings from others were added to the thefts) and, in addition, there was his particular drama regarding the absence of a family (not necessarily getting married and conceiving children, not least because a good number of friends can be considered a family), which ironically is supplied while fulfilling its selfish purpose. He already had everything; he conquered a desired happiness without realizing it. An interesting point in the relationship between Verne and RJ is a certain ""dispute"" of protagonist, but it is obvious that the hitherto solitary raccoon is the owner of the biggest spotlight, after all. It took the harsh words of his worst enemy, the cunning Vincent, to make him have an epiphany related to what he really wanted all this time at a time in the championship where Verne and the others were in serious danger at the hands of Dwayne due to the failure of the robbery. Finale (best sequel I must say, I was stuck in my chair hoping they would succeed). Furthermore, RJ got his personal fulfillment to fill an emotional void through the wrong methods of prioritizing his biggest problem.Harmed by a track that just comments on passages in the script, ""Over The Hedge"" is once again enchanting due to its interesting critique of modern society's consumerism, portraying humans as creatures who basically live to eat and spend, investing, among other things. Things, in huge and polluting cars that are used to transport a single person. In addition, there is also an acidic reference to the extreme right-wing conservatism of Texas, which prides itself on being the state that executes the most prisoners in the entire United States: in a certain scene, a ""pest exterminator"" comments that he invented such an item. Cruelty that ended up being banned in all but one state - guess which one?There's no denying that ""Over The Hedge"" is a great option for children, even though it doesn't invest practically any time in building a more elaborate moral lesson (the old story of the egoist's redemption has already been told many times, and should no longer surprise the little minds of children). No, the film is much shallower than that. It's not a problem, nowhere is there a law that says that any cinematographic work must teach or be especially important to people's lives. The fact is, coming from DreamWorks, there's an empty feeling at the end of the session. Although this is a very busy and generally fun job, it never gets really exciting.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Over the Hedge, overall, a surprisingly good movie","I went to see Over the Hedge with my family, which includes my parents who are in there 50s, my niece not quite 7 yet, me the teenager, my sister in her 30s, we all loved it. Over the Hedge is about a raccoon in trouble, and a group of foragers he tricks into helping him out. This is a movie the whole family will enjoy, definitely a laugh-out-loud comedy. Being the moody and hard to please teen that i am,i did not think that i would like this movie, but i love it. I was surprised by how good it was. My only objection is that the voice of the exterminator Dwayne (played by Thomas Haden Church)did not quite go w/ the character. He did the best he could, but the voice just wasn't quite what u'd expect, it needed to be a bit deeper, more menacing. Otherwise, it was a great movie, with a lot of laughs.

The odd joke for adults but very much a kids movie,"Dreamworks is famous for animated classics such as 'Shrek' and 'Madagascar', but 'Over the Hedge' is probably one of their least renowned movies. I didn't think I had seen it until my memory was jogged by the scene with the racoon in the dangerous garden. That should give you an idea of how memorable this movie is - not very.I continued watching though and it's a decent enough piece of entertainment. It strikes me as being aimed a lot more at kids than the likes of 'Shrek', which had a lot humour in it that would only be picked up by adults. The vast majority of the humour in 'Over the Hedge' is aimed at kids, including an abundance of fart jokes. The plot is also extremely thin...

Little Hammy, as voiced by the wondrously talented Steve Correl, makes the movie, but you also have Captain Kirk himself as a possum who loves to play possum and is so touched when his daughter seems to have inherited his knack for appearing to be roadkill.

A remarkable paucity of fart jokes!,"""Over the Hedge"" came as a pleasant surprise both for what it was and what it was not. Dreamworks managed to put together a computer-animated feature with a name cast that largely avoided the tiresome pop-cultural references that bog down the genre and make it feel like you've taken your child to ""Scary Movie 8: The Cartoon!!!"". The few explicit nods to the adults in the audience--Bill Shatner's ""Rosebud!"" brought tears to my eyes--were restrained and well-done. Fans of Steve Carell and Allison Janney will have many reasons to smile, if not laugh out loud, and everyone else was able to be lovable without ever being cloying, a neat trick. My two-year old was as enrapt as I was: my ""Wow! Nick Nolte DOES sound exactly like a bear!"" vs. her ""Wow! Bear is mean!"" In short, a perfect distraction for a sweltering afternoon. The purveyors of ""Shrek""-dreck should be taking notes. Be sure before you take the little ones that you're comfortable exposing them to the same Yosemite Sam/Tom & Jerry-level violence to which we were exposed.

"Perfectly enjoyable, but somehow forgettable.","An enjoyable and fairly intelligent children's film, making a change from the usual tripe DreamWorks' computer animation studio churns out. RJ the raccoon needs to get food to replace what he stole from an angry bear, so he enlists naive forest animals who have just woken up for spring to find that their forest is now a housing estate. It has a few problems that make Over The Hedge less memorable than it deserves to be, Verne the tortoise, sensible leader of the forest animals, is voiced by Garry Shandling as if he has been tranquillised, even his screaming sounds bored, the pace can be a little slow in places, and the music is far too slow, and there are too many characters to care about, only Hammy the hyperactive squirrel and RJ the scheming raccoon are interesting. Also, the basic plot is a little irritating. RJ is lying to them, they're going to find out, but he really doesn't need to lie to get what he wants, and the moment half way through when Verne destroys all their hard work is infuriating. Unfortunately Over The Hedge is clearly trying for a Woody and Buzz dynamic between Venre and RJ but fails because the film starts with RJ, making him the main character, and he's the one with the personality, so he's the one the audience cares for, so it doesn't come across that he might be stealing Verne's thunder. Basically, Over The Hedge is much more enjoyable than it looks, but it doesn't really linger in the memory once it has finished.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

They may not have resorted to fart humor, but what you get here isn't really much better. Everything is exaggerated so that you don't notice how little you actually get.

Full of Satire and Laughs for the Older Audience,"It's been awhile since I've seen an enjoyable animated film. Toy Story (1 & 2) and Shrek come to mind.From beginning to end, this movie is suffused with enough satire to keep you interested. You learn to watch and listen for the subtle and direct jokes and inferences they make about society and people in general (they're mostly all true too). By the end, your face should be sore and swollen from all the smiling and laughing.While the movie generated a few hilarious moments with its animation, it did not rely on it to make you laugh. It's a thinking film. It's a observational film. By making a satire about the way we live, it makes us consider it and the humor about it. You're brain is there, basically.Voice casting was excellent. Bruce Willis did a good job. Again, I was very impressed.

It is not a movie to be laughing out loud, but still it's entertaining.It has a couple of very touching moments and the message is good. I still find some similarities with Madagascar on the CG's (the bear) and the verminator looks a lot like the villain from Toy Story 2.I think the Dreamworks guys did a very good job with the characters and the story, since with Madagascar I felt sometimes the story was a little bit slow and with OTH this doesn't happen anymore.I totally recommend it, go watch it! have fun and leave the theater with a good smile!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hollywood actually shows some taste,"One other poster mentioned it, but it is such an important point that it bears repeating.This film could have been the most obnoxious pile of product placement in the history of cinema. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of opportunities to put real brands on packages. They could well have recovered a significant percentage of the production costs by selling labels on every package of food. And the shocking, wonderful part is that they didn't! There is not one real brand anywhere in this film! To some extent, this will help the film retain an early Disney ""timelessness"", unlike the embarrassing joke about ""Pepsi Free"" that mars ""Back To The Future"".The other poster mentioned that the products might not be shown in the best light, but I don't think that is a problem. All the food is shown as desirable and delicious (especially compared to tree bark), and there is nothing about the presentation that any corporate sponsor would object to.Again, thanks to the powers that be at Dreamworks for showing remarkable restraint and foresightedness in not turning this film into a 90 minute long commercial.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The Hedge is a must see for 2006, and all-time","I like animations and 2006 is packed with quite a few of these movies that will be kid-centric. While the cast of ""Over the Hedge"" was a little surprising and mystifying the end result was remarkable.Nick Nolte looks better as a bear than the last time we saw him as a human. The oaf-like sidekick from the TV series ""Wings"" was the perfect ""Verminator"" and the ignorant boss from ""The Office"" was the best representation of a squirrel I've seen though his primary concern was finding his nuts. The rest of the movie fell into place so well that not only were the kids entertained but the parents had a few laughs as well.The adventure is fantastic though believable in the cartoon sense. With lessons to learn, characters that you'll love to hate and the non-stop action. My Kids were glued to their seats.Notable coolness... Mr. William Shatner sheds his Shatner-esquire mannerisms for the role of a possum, playing the father of heather (Avril Lavigne) who, together display a perfect and honourable single-parent family with respect for each other. Bruce Willis plays a resourceful, though self-centered raccoon named RJ that wants to use his new-found forest mates to repay a debt, to a bear. He learns about family and loyalty. His transformation was one of many and the most rewarding for the character. The whole cast is wonderful.On May 19th this wonderful movie opens and should be a must-see for any family or for those young at heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Clever and satiric for adults. Just plain fun for kids.,"Based on the comic strip by Michael Fry and T. Lewis, this is a loud & lively animated comedy brimming with endearing characters, and some laugh out loud gags. Bruce Willis, back in the days when he still seemed to give a damn, is nicely cast as the voice of R.J., a conniving, self serving raccoon who foolishly tries to steal the food supply of a bear named Vincent (voice of Nick Nolte). When the stash is demolished, R.J. ropes a troupe of foraging forest critters into helping him find a replacement stash. And he believes there will be easy pickings when they go ""over the hedge"" and into the suburban sprawl that is encroaching upon their wilderness.It is thanks to the success of ""Toy Story"" from a decade previous that a formula got perfected in this sort of entertainment, with some bright and cutting humor for adults to enjoy. It's not subtle about its criticisms of suburban life, but some people might not mind. And, although it may be rather too intense for the youngest of your family members, kids are more than likely to really take to the critter characters. Some of the humor may be obvious, but it does still work. There is even a sort of nod to Pepe Le Pew cartoons as our heroes give Stella the skunk (voice of Wanda Sykes) a makeover in order to pull the wool over a pet cats' (voice of Omid Djalili) eyes.The animation is slick and first rate, and there's plenty of peppy music in the form of a score by Rupert Gregson-Williams and songs by Ben Folds.The all star main voice cast also includes William Shatner as a possum who's appropriately hammy when he fakes death, a hilarious Garry Shandling as Verne the turtle, Steve Carell as a crazed squirrel named Hammy, Thomas Haden Church as a lunkhead exterminator, Allison Janney as a neighborhood busybody, Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as porcupine parents, and pop star Avril Lavigne as the possum daughter.Quite entertaining overall, especially the way that it continues with gags through the closing credits.One of the brightest bits for this viewer was the way that R.J. educated his newfound friends on the way that humans worship food and give it such predominance in their lives.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Steve Carrell is ten times funnier, as Hamilton the Squirrel, than he was as ""the 40 Year Old Virgin!""","Seriously, though: I loved this movie! Bruce Willis does a great job as the voice of RJ. A kleptomaniacal raccoon who makes the mistake of robbing the human junk-food hoard of Vincent the Bear (voiced by Nick Nolte, as a sort of anti-Yogi).So, he journeys to a nearby housing development called Rancho Camelot, to replenish Vincent's stockpile. This community has all-but-overrun the woodland habitat of some just-awakened hibernators, led by Verne the Tortoise (voiced by Gary Shandling). And, his penetration of the wall-like hedge bush surrounding their small patch of woods leads to a semi-hilarious encounter with human suburbanites.Enter RJ, who volunteers to ""instruct"" them on how to take advantage of discarded human food.He and Verne naturally disagree on this point, at first. Resulting in an absolutely hysterical sequence that climaxes with a rocket-propelled red wagon taking both of them sky-high!Just before they crash back to Earth, Verne looks at RJ and utters those bound-to-be-immortal words:""You're the Devil.""How RJ gets out of his impending jam with Vincent will bring tears of joy to both your eyes, and your kids (assuming you have any).P.S.---listen closely to the voice of Father Opossum, and see if you can guess just...which...STAR TREK...veteran...it...is.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome Family Entertainment!,"This movie had something for everyone! The voice actors were tremendous. Bruce Willis, Steve Carell, Gary Shandling and William Shatner were hilarious! The story was fast paced and enjoyable. Unfortunately, the previews at the theater we went to were not appropriate. Parents might want to occupy their children during the preview of one film titled, Monster House. My son had nightmares for 2 nights because of the preview. Monster House has not yet been rated, but it did not look like something for the younger set. Otherwise, go Over the Hedge and enjoy a fun, summer flick!

"Surprisingly better than ""Cars""","Coming into ""Over the Hedge"" I was not expecting much. This did not look too exciting or humorous and looked just like the countless amount of cute talking animal movies that I have seen over my lifetime. I believed that there was no way that it could be better ""Cars"" (this was before I saw ""Cars""). Luckily, I was surprised to see that not only was this entertaining but this is better then the overrated ""Cars.""The voice acting was well done. The highlight had to be Steve Carrell as Hammy, a hyperactive squirrel. Carrell was hilarious and there is one scene almost worth the price of admission. Bruce Willis made a charming RJ though if they chose Jim Carrey instead, Jim Carrey was originally cast as RJ until the studio replaced him with Bruce Willis, I would enjoy it more. William Shatner plays a frequently overacting possum named Ozzie who likes to play dead. Garry Shandling is Verne the turtle, someone who did not agree with the welcoming of RJ. Wanda Stykes is Stella the skunk, whose best scene is wooing a Persian cat named Tiger played by Omid Djalili. Even Avril Lavigne voices Ozzie's daughter Heather, who was not annoying and not noticeable until I saw her name in the credits.The jokes are well done and appeal to both children and adults. There are the obvious jokes about possums playing dead, and skunks doing what skunks do best, but the creators take the jokes a step further. There is a scene where RJ explains to the animals all about the magic of food and the effect food have on humans, which was the highlight of the trailers. There is also scene that is a great homage to Pepe LePew. As I mentioned earlier, there is a scene with Hammy that was almost worth the price of admission. Another thing I liked is that it does not rely too much upon fart or pop culture jokes, which is plagued in many animated movies. This movie ends as a great mix of physical comedy and as a satire of the modern suburban family.Unfortunately, there are negatives too. The plot has been told many times before and because of this, it became a little predictable. This story is about someone who is an outcast meeting a family and the affects on him and the family. The satire though is what separates this from an average animated movie. There were far too many characters. Therefore, with that in mind you have two options; take out one or two characters, or add to the run time. The characters that were pointless and undeveloped were two porcupines played by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara. The animation, while still amazing, was not anything new or groundbreaking but that is the fault of all of the studios pushing so many animated features. Despite a few flaws, I really enjoyed this. Both children and adults can enjoy this and I recommend you renting this with your family.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Over The Hedge,"We previewed this film through a radio station email promotion in Los Angeles. The film was very funny and the production values are excellent. I laughed at the characters antics, cried honestly at some wonderfully written moments and sat watching in amazement at the brilliant casting. Today is May 12, 2006 and this film has not come out in the theaters yet, so I will not give away any details. Suffice it to say this film is appropriate for all ages, although there ARE a few hidden adult jokes. The audience was mostly under 12 years old, but the children sat through this film riveted to their seats-no ""I have to use the bathroom"" cries mid-film. The adults seemed to enjoy the film as much as the children. (I know I did). I have nothing negative to say about this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

There's some cartoon violence, but it's all done in a humorous way that won't scare the little ones.I think Steve Carrell as Hammy the hyperactive squirrell steals the movie.

I loved Over the Hedge!,"I have to admit, I was getting a little worried with all these computer animated animal movies, it seems like your typical plot with over done cuteness. It has some of the over done cuteness, but actually, I still really enjoyed watching Over the Hedge, it had great humor and a fun story. Not to mention a great cat of stars that seemed like they just had a blast doing this movie.It's about a raccoon, RJ who is starving and attempts to steal a bear's stash of food, unfortunately, he is caught and accidentally destroys the bear's stash. RJ promises him that if he can get all the snacks back then the bear, Vincent, will spare his life. RJ gets a group of forest animals who are surrounded by suburbia, the only sanctuary they have is behind their hedge in the forest. RJ tricks them into thinking that they are just gathering snacks for themselves, but he's really secretly is getting Vincent his snacks back. Instead, RJ finds himself a true family and teaches them strength and self esteem on how to live like kings!This story has great values for the kids, not to mention the jokes are great for either kids or adults. The animation is great and really fun to look at, it's amazing how far we've come, how alive these creatures look. I would highly recommend Over the Hedge for anyone, it's highly entertaining and just a great family film!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Three generations enjoyed this movie.,"My mother and my son joined me this evening to watch this movie. I really expected this to be a kids' movie, with some base/bathroom humor. My mistake! I was afraid that it would be more ""Scooby Doo"" than ""South Park"" style, but there was a very comfortable combination of the two, minus the bad words. The writing was impeccable, and the humor provided true belly laughs for each of us. The timing was fast, the quips hysterical, and even the ""bonding moments"" were too delicious to miss.

DreamWorks' best animated feature!!!!,"I just went to see ""OTH"" and I have to say it's a fantastic movie with top-notch voice acting, superb visuals, a lot of fall-out-rolling-on-the-floor funny moments, and it also has plenty of heartfelt tear-jerking moments as well. Another great thing about ""OTH"" is the movie keeps the gross-out humor and pop culture references to the absolute bare minimum, unlike a lot of CGI films. This is definitely one of the greatest animated films of all time. Forget the overrated stuff like Shrek, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo, this CGI flick is one of best! I give it a perfect 10 all the way! Don't miss it, you won't be disappointed. Also buy the DVD whenever it comes out. The ticket price and the DVD price are worth it.P.S. Hopefully there'll be some sequels and a T.V. series before too much longer.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderfully Funny,"I was not expecting much from this film, but I was very mistaken. This is a wonderfully funny story that had the audience of mostly adults roaring through most of the film. The story is based on a comic strip, telling the story of how two unlikely companions first met. The other characters in the film are mostly original and not in the comic strip. While nominally a buddy picture, there is plenty of action and even a romance that pays tribute to Pepe Le Pew cartoons. The character designs are excellent, and the computer graphics are superb. The voice talent does a very good job, especially for celebrity voices. Hammy the squirrel, voiced by Steve Carell, stole the show. There is a scene near the end of the film with Hammy that is truly one of the most brilliant animated sequences I've ever seen. I can't wait to see this film again to see all the details I missed the first time.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"OVER THE HEDGE : Formulaic, But The Comedy Is Still Worth It...","OVER THE HEDGEDreamworks' latest computer-animated release OVER THE HEDGE is a truly polished film told in the typical formula. That formula - taking cute(or really ugly) characters, placing them in outlandish situations, have the villain be some stupid human, and sprinkle lots of adult humor and pop-culture references to make it's comedy more edgy. The thing with OVER THE HEDGE is, it manages to take that formula and keep it lively... unfortunately it still can't avoid the label of being a ""formulaic"" movie.OVER THE HEDGE tells the story of RJ (Bruce Willis), a scavenger raccoon who lives on his own off of other people's food. However, he makes the mistake of trying to rob Vincent the bear (voiced by an enjoyably evil Nick Nolte) of all his food during hibernation. When Vincent catches RJ in the act, RJ is forced to regather that much food in one weeks time or else he will be ""offed"" (sound like A BUG'S much?). To save his life, RJ sets out to con a loving family of forest animals led by Verne the Turtle (Garry Shandling) into robbing the local humans of all their food.OVER THE HEDGE excels at infusing it's story with laugh-out-loud comedy. Even though the storyline is familiar and the characters seem like characteristics, the jokes are fresh and elicits genuine laughter. Also, despite the familiarity of the ""cute characters"", some of them have such inspired voice work that they manage to stand out. Steve Carrel proves that he is the master of evoking comedy out of any and all situations... his character of Hammy the Squirell is a riot.The storyline, though familiar & lacking in substance is handled with a brisk and lighthearted pace that makes the film fly by. It even manages to get in some environmental commentary on America in without being too heavy-handed (though at times the whole ""people are lazy"" bit goes a little too far... don't insult your audience Dreamworks!).However, the film has some distinct flaws too. Aside from the inspired voice work of Mr. Carrell and serviceable performances from the rest of the cast... this film also features some of the worst voice-over work I've ever heard. Whichever casting agent thought that by casting Avril Lavinge was a good idea should be fired... asap. Sorry Avril, stick to the songwriting cuz this performance was awful. What might have been a better idea was simply hiring her to write the music... b/c whoever they did hire to write the songs was terrible as well. For some reason OVER THE HEDGE felt the need to include 3 musical montages all set to some of the corniest music I've ever heard. All of these montages proved pointless and they brought what is essentially a funny, fast-paced comedy to a screeching halt.Overall, the good-intentions and genuine laughs won me over. Despite the two major flaws in Lavigne's voice-work and the craptastic music... OVER THE HEDGE remains one of the funniest comedies I've seen in theaters for a while. At this point it's still okay for a Dreamworks' animated movie to fly-by on sheer comedy and joy alone. However, as a warning to Dreamworks, the formula will get old soon and it's time the powers that be over there start to improve and differentiate their animated films... b/c soon enough, genuine laughs won't be enough anymore....

"cute movie ... not AS funny as I thought, but cute.","So I went with my mom, sister and guy for a Memorial Day treat to see this movie. My sister went off about how hilarious it looked with the spastic little squirrel thing and how cute the previews were. I saw previews and agreed, it sure did look pretty darn cute. And that was it. The movie was cute. Funny parts here and there, but it reminded me a lot of what I thought of ""Ice Age"" ... the funny parts that made me laugh were all from the previews with the spastic little squirrel thing.This was definitely more entertaining than ""Ice Age,"" though, but less entertaining I think for the kids. So don't go bringing the tots who are like four years old thinking they'll enjoy it. It's a bit too in-depth in some parts and there's not enough slap-stick to keep them glued to the screen and prevent them from slapping the person in front of their seat or start crying. Yes. About six incidents disrupted my viewing.My ultimate favorite scene was with the stopping. If you see it, you'll know, and it made the movie allllll worth it. A few times over worth it even. I don't regret spending the money, even though I didn't pay for it... nowadays movies are so costly they're often times not worth it, but I definitely don't regret it.If you want to go see something cute and funny for a playful time, go ahead and see this one.

"Over the Hedge, another safe animation","""Over the Hedge"" is yet another ""safe"" animation. I am beginning to realize that most, if not all animations these days are of the ""safe"" variety.

"The Entire Human Condition Through the Eyes of Furry, Cuddly Woodland Creatures","Computer animated films are usually intelligent comedies that offer a different perspective on the world. ""Over the Hedge"" is no exception. But while Disney & Pixar's ""Toy Story"" and ""Monster Inc."" offered a peek into the worlds of toys and monsters, respectively, and Dreamwork's ""Madagascar"" offered a peek into the world of wild animals, ""Over the Hedge"" is different in that it uses woodland animals to provide an eye-opening look at the human world.The movie open with a CGI raccoon named R. J. (voiced by action star Bruce Willis) attempting to steal a bag of chips from a vending machine. Upon failing, R. J. enters a bear cave and manages to get caught laying waste to the bear's enormous food pantry. The bear (voiced menacingly by Nick Nolte) offers R. J. an ultimatum: replace the food within a week, or become the food.Meanwhile, a group of woodland creatures awakens from hibernation, voiced by some of the greatest stars to grace both the big and small screens, including ""Star Trek""'s William Shatner and ""The Office""'s Steve Carrell. The woodland creatures are shocked to find that most of their woods have been replaced by suburbia while they were sleeping. R. J. finds them and offers to guide them into human civilization, all the while taking advantage of them in order to recreate his bear friend's food stash.""Over the Hedge"" is based on a comic strip, so it's not surprising that the film holds a slightly satiric, thoughtful, and quirky brand of humor worthy of a Sunday funnies page. The screenplay by Len Blum, who co-wrote this year's ""The Pink Panther"", touches on the topic of the modern human lifestyle of excess, a lifestyle that includes too little nature, too much TV, and way too much food. The woodland creatures offer a wise commentary on SUV's, video games, electronics, and junk food products. Each time R. J. leads the naïve creatures into the suburbs, the animals lose their innocence to the corruption of the modern American lifestyle. A less subtle theme throughout the movie is family, as cool but conniving drifter R. J. begins to see a chance at redemption.Like the best computer animated comedies, ""Over the Hedge"" provides jokes for both children and adults without ever becoming crude or obnoxious. Only a few of the jokes are direct parallels of pop culture, and most of those, like in ""Madagascar"", are tributes to classics like ""Citizen Kane"" and ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" rather than the latest entertainment fads. ""Over the Hedge"" is a must-see for both children and adults.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
now that's animation film.,"Now that's what you call a perfect animation film. The first aim of animation has to be humor and Over the Hedge has that in plenty and mind you not only for kids. It will surely make the adults laugh as well. And the humor and fun is not only in animation but in dialogs as well, which makes the film all the more enjoyable. A good story coupled with state of the art 3D animation, apt voices and good direction make it a worth family outing. But fun and laughter is not the only thing this flick has to offer, it teaches a lesson or two without you ever realizing that you are being taught. that's the beauty of the film. It points a finger on changing life styles, clearance of forests for living space, cheating is always bad and more prominently the family values.

These animals discover a hedge that is separating them from suburbia.When they go over the hedge, their lives change forever as they are exposed to the everyday lives of the human race.RJ, meanwhile, uses the animals to help him get food from the humans, but not all of them trust him.The Pros: This film will appeal to all ages. It is hysterical and very clever. The characters have such great personalities which are easy to relate to even though they are animals.There is a lot of character development as well as witty humour that will be appreciated by young and old alike. The all star cast is spectacular too.The Cons: It is way too short! The film is only 83 minutes!Special Features: Tons of nutty games and activities. An insider's look at behind the Hedge.

Best CGI Movie Yet,"Honestly, I have not had so much fun at a movie in a while. This movie was cute, fast paced and funny. Dreamworks once again creates a movie that both adults and kids will enjoy. In fact the theater I was in was uproaring with laughter from patrons of all ages.I have seen most of the CGI movies and a lot of other animated movies as of late considering I have a young child. I think I summed it all up in the first paragraph, but I REALLY ENJOYED this one as much as my child....maybe even more. Each animal had their own quirky personalities. The raccoon is the ring leader. He convinces the other animals to go 'over the hedge' to humanland and get exciting food not bark or a few tiny berries which they have been dispersing in tiny portions. Afterall there are around 10 animals in all. The most comedic is the squirrel. The skunk has a few moments....really they all made me laugh. The turtle who is very cute is the one who is skeptical of the raccoon. The raccoon ulterior motive is to get replacement food for the bear who's food the raccoon happened to destroy.I highly recommend this movie if you are at all on the borderline or like me would like to see it but where do you get the time. Run out and see this one. Haven't seen Cars yet, it may very well be good but this one is as good as they get. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful,"Beautiful film that addresses the daily problems of simple animals in a brilliant, innovative and entertaining way. In the end, the film makes you very attached to the main characters and very little to the others.

One of the best stories ever seen in animation,"The cast says it all. This movie is fun from the first minute to the last. When my daughter first asked me to watch the film with her for the first time, I was reluctant, but I'm glad I did. We now own it on digital and we watch it at least a few times every year. It's funny, has a great moral, and the storyline is just about as perfect as it gets. Every voice fits each character perfectly, and the scene where Hammy drinks the energy drink to activate the Depelter Turbo had me on the floor laughing. Fun for kids and adults alike, this a great family film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
a great movie,"I was totally amazed at how good this movie was, now i've seen a few of the kids movies but not that many, and this was better than any kids movie .. animation that i have seen. Loved the actors/actresses who they got to do the voices here,, Bruce Willis,, perfect choice, Eugene Levy, Gary Shandling,, William Shatner, and yes even AVril Lavigne my daughter's fav. singer. The plot line was very good as well, i mean you have this squirrel who steals food from the bear, get's caught of course, then has 7 days to get all of the food back before the bear get's up from hibernation.. bear woke up early cause the squirrel made such a racket to steal the bear's food. The squirrel then goes into suburbia ... on the other side of the hedge to join up with some of the other animals who were in hibernation to help him with his plan. unbeknown est to them of course,, what a great family movie here, trust me , this is good , and not just for kids, i am usually very leery of animation movies, but this was top notch.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

What would I do without my Hammy. Its a shame I did not get to see this masterpeice in theaters(If only God could have created me before 2006). The emotional gut punches as well as the knee-slap inducing comedy make for the objectively, unanimously decided upon(do not ask anyone because it is a waste of time and you know what the answer will be) best movie of all time(maybe besides The Bee Movie but that is for a whole nother day).

Brilliant and Hilarious- One of the most Underrated Kid's flicks to date,"With a stellar soundtrack and score, voice cast, and so much more- Over the Hedge is an incredibly underrated little animated flick that was truly ahead of its time. I've seen this film nearly 100 times during my life, I watched it a lot when I was little and I have always been very fond of it- but there are so many satirical efforts and bits of commentary from this film that is truly quite hilarious in accuracy. The film is an incredibly funny social commentary on living in the suburbs, as well as being ahead of the times with its Karen-like antagonist Galdys being at the forefront of it all. The animals are uniquely designed and the animation for the most part is quite excellent, if not a bit standard at times (mainly with its human characters). Its voice cast is incredibly well done, with Bruce Willis as our main protagonist RJ, Gary Shandling as Verne, Steve Carell as Hammy, Wanda Sykes as Stella, Allison Janney as Gladys, Nick Nolte as Vincent, and Thomas Haden Church as Dwayne. The script is full of sarcastic humor and many incredibly funny scenes in general that made me truly laugh out loud at the screen. In the end, I find very little wrong with Over the Hedge in the scheme of things. Besides its hilarious and satirical tendencies, it also has quite a big heart, and I don't feel a movie like this will quite ever get old.My Rating: 9.7/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent character driven story!,"I enjoyed it! By now, some of us are pretty jaded when it comes to CG movies. Over the Hedge ought to make you think twice.The digital rendering of facial expressions have come a long way since the early days and Over the Hedge gets it right by giving us subtlety instead of fireworks. This movie features some of the most expressive and well-""acted"" characters I've seen in a while.All the actors used their voices to great effect showing again that a where all the characters are CG, the vocal acting skills are all-important. A special shout out has to go to Steve Carell whose Hammy is a wonderful gas and also to Bruce Willis who (drained of the needless machismo he usually plays his roles with) gives us a wonderfully charismatic RJ the Racoon.A superb family film. Definitely worth collecting on DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved it! Big Surprise!,"I took my grandkids to see this movie at a $1 a person theater. I really didn't expect much, after taking them to see Madagascar(boring!). But I must say that I love this movie. I'm going to take my other grandkids to see it tomorrow. Somehow I missed who the voice of Hammy was, so I came home and looked it up. Steve Carell was SO good as this hyper squirrel! I also absolutely loved the possum dad, William Shatner, he was so great making fun of himself. I'm getting this on DVD also!I just don't like any animated movies anymore, besides Shrek, but I LOVED this one. I've told everyone about it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Rare Gem of Modern Family Comedy,"I had to choose between seeing Over the Hedge or Mission Impossible III this week; I chose Over the Hedge, and that is one decision I have not regretted. The movie got off to a somewhat pessimistic start with the introduction to it's ridiculously clichéd and perhaps somewhat stupid central plot device. However, once it took off, neither that nor anything else could slow the movie's momentum, and Vincent, the homicidal plot device, became less and less of a burden to the film's plot and comedy.Over the hedge has a truly delightful collection of characters, and the rich personalities to match. Together, they form one of the most amusing mildly dysfunctional families ever to hit the screen. The movie was packed with somewhat tongue-in-cheek humor and references  even a reference to Citizen Kane was woven hilariously into a scene. The light innuendos and subtle adult humor helped to gear it at least as much toward a mature audience as a young one, though perhaps some of the implied violence pushed the boundaries of the PG rating.The effects and CG graphics were first-rate Pixar, and the animals' fur was especially well-done.All told, Over the Hedge was packed with great laughs, and is one of the few movies this summer that is well worth the ticket price. Take the time to go see it if you haven't already.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic Furry and Adventurous Flick,"This new release from the creators of Shrek really caught my eye. The computer graphics were as always cutting edge but I didn't think much about it through out the movie. The reason was because the film was so fun,and adventurous. Okay so the plot was written by a seven year old, but it was a great adventure.Props to Dreamworks for making a new fresh cast of characters with the vocal talents of Steve Carrell and Gary Shandling. Over the hedge was not over the top, but I did enjoy it and give it an above average 8 out of 10.Recommend- Anyone who enjoys a good animated flick What it's like- Toy Story in the forest, without toys or much of a story!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

It had great animation, all the characters were all lovable and the story was just long enough for a children's film.We seen this film at the beginning of July and usually my kids would have forgotten about it but this film they are still going on about and my youngest is doing the voices for some of the characters.It was that good my even my wife wanted to see it again.I would recommend this film to anyone who is a child at heart and just wants an easy going night at the cinema.Definitely 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Surprisingly good,"I became an Over the Hedge fan completely by accident. I saw the previews and it looked like another cookie cutter CG movie, of which there have been way too many recently. But my cousin wanted to see it, so I found myself in the theater with extremely low expectations.I was completely wrong! This movie has all the humor and heart of Shrek, and, to be honest, impressed me a lot more than either of those films. This movie finds a way to be satirical without being too cynical, because the indictment of modern suburban living is coupled with a message about what's really important. These sentiments, however, do NOT overwhelm the humor and fast pace of the story.Filled with many laugh-out-loud moments, this movie elicited applause from my usually cynical college audience when it was screened at our university. It has kid and adult appeal, and it really stands a head above the swarm of lame CG movies out there now.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Much better than I was waiting .,"""Over the Hedge"" was one of the few good animated movies of the 2006. Inspired in the comic strip of Michael Fry and T .Lewis ,it follows the adventures of a raccoon , RJ (Bruce Willis ) that was victim of his own ambition when he tries to steal the food of a bear . He not only misses it ,but also the bear see him when he was stealing the food ,so he orders recover all his things or he will eat RJ .Desperate , RJ find a group of animals that doesn't know that his forest is now a neighborhood ,and that they aren't welcome . Soon ,he offers help them , without saying his secret intentions .The problems start when RJ starts to appreciate the other animals .This movie works very well in many levels : the jokes are effective ,the humor is clever (of course ,some times it appeal to the slapstick )the characters are likable ,and funny ... the cast of voices was pretty good ,it wasn't only to use some famous names . Steve Carrell did a great job as Hammy . Worth watching .",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Over the Hedge; the best Dreamworks has done so far,"I give Over the Hedge 15 out of 10 points. This is quite possibly the best film to ever come out of Dreamworks. It has a great story and is enjoyable by everybody. It has great animation, such a greatness, we have yet to see in a movie. The film is based on a comic strip of the same name written by Michael Fry and T. Lewis. RJ(Willis), a cunning, family-of-one, raccoon, in his quest for food, destroys a bears whole supply. With just a week to pay it back or pay with his life, he needs a miracle. Just such a miracle occurs when he meets Verne(Shandling), a tentative turtle, and his family of woodland critters,(Carell, Sykes, Shatner, Levy, O'Hara, Lavigne, Kirkpatrick, Baumel), all of which, are foragers. Unfortunately, their woodland forest was cut down while they were hibernating and replaced by Suburbia, except for the small acre or so yet to be demolished. What will they do for food? Verne's ""family"" has the food gathering skills, RJ has the know-how, and the humans have the food.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Film!!,"This hilarious movie has all the qualities: It has the laughs and it has the cuteness,there's action, and even a little romance(the skunk with the dog...LOL). So this movie is an all rounder. It suits the needs of a child because of its animation and the cute characters, but also at the same time, has humour for the adults who watch it. Laughs all round. The plot of the film is pretty good, because the food shortage is a common plot in animal films. They are going to go to many means to get the food that they want. The raccoon is secretly going to steal it thought for that bear that he stole from. But, in the end he stays friends with the others and they all have plenty of food to share between them. I personally (as you have probably guessed), love the film...it is truly amazing and awesome. :)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Food!,"How wonderfully original is it, that somebody made an animated film with a plot revolving around food. Great comedy, great voice acting skills, ingredients for the whole family without getting ott. I saw the trailer for this film whilst in the auditorium for Narnia. I knew instantly that this film was something for me to watch. My favorite character is Hammy, probably because he reminds me of me in many cases, and it is great, in that respect to be able to laugh at oneself. This is a film I would recommend to anyone, the whole family will love it. I will be honoured to own it on DVD when it comes out. The only flaw that I could see, was the racoon (CJ?) voiced by Bruce Willis sleeping in the daytime. Racoons are naturally nocturnal animals, so this is just a minor flaw. Otherwise, the film entertains in every way with something for everyone, even providing some educational insight in to nature.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful comedy,"This is an excellently made comedy for all ages. The movie is similar to Madagascar in that the main characters are animals. The visualization and animation is superb especially the expressions on the main characters' faces. Subtle sarcastic comments about human behavior and our destruction of natural habitat are apt (example: How many people usually ride in an SUV? Answer: It is usually one). The length of the movie is just right - under 2 hours. Since this movie was based on a comic strip, extending the movie beyond 2 hours would have been an overkill.Dreamworks are at the top of the heap - as good as Disney/Pixar.Salute the amazing talent behind the movie by going to watching it in theaters!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Deserves a better rating,"Purposely didn't read anything before watching this movie with the family (kids 8 & 4) during the confinement. It's genuinely a very funny movie, but it's mostly an understated, ironic type of humor. There are no endless car chases (save one), no huge explosions, and yes, it doesn't paint the best picture of us humans. However, I can totally imagine how weird we must seem to forest creatures. We all laughed out loud several times watching this, my kids even rewinded a few pieces since they thought it was hysterical. Give this movie a chance, you won't regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant,"Despite being my favorite animated film of the year, opening against the mush talked-about ""The Da Vinci Code"" certainly didn't help it become a major success. Nevertheless, I must say that I am slightly shocked to see that it was overlooked at many award giving ceremonies and prizes. Apart from sporting an over-the-top voice cast, the film also appeals to all ages. The animation is cute and of unprecedented beauty. The characters are also great fun and they are voiced to perfection by the likes of Bruce Willis, Avril Lavigne, Eugene Levy, and Catherine O'Hara. Oh, and that's not mentioning Steve Carrel who had my sides aching with laughter, as his turn as the hyper-active squirrel easily becomes an all-time favorite character. As I have previously mentioned there is huge fun and I loved the ironic twist on many ordinary things.VerdictIn my opinion, this was the best cartoon film of the year, boasting a great look and some of the best voice talents in the business.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Movie Ever,"I am 15, and I've seen tons of movies before, and this by far my absolute favorite. My brother loves it too. My sister says it's okay, which I think it is ridiculous. She says the reason why is because it is a cartoon.
Why do people hate on cartoons so much? I mean some people like them, but a lot of people will judge a movie harshly because it is a cartoon. It's ridiculous. The reason why this is a cartoon is because it would look really bad if it were live action. Imagine a live action movie of racoons, squirells, and turtles robbing people of food. That would look so bad, so they made it a cartoon, and automatically it looks better. I'm not saying that cartoons are better than live action, or live action is better than animation. It all depends on what the movie is about and if the plot is actually smart.
Anyways, this is a great movie. It has it all. Comedy, action, sadness, friendship, and life lessons. My favorite character is Verminator, of course. And it is family friendly.
Watch this movie immediatly after reading this review because the idiots of this world below this review will say different, but that is because they are cartoon biased and like live action more. Trust me, you will love this movie if you are smart.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funny and original - a nice change for Dreamworks,"Over that past few years, Dreamworks has given us surprises as well as disappointments. 'Shrek', though hilarious, is basically the 'Scary Movie' of animation, making fun of everything that is hip at the very moment. 'Shark Tale' was just simply wrong and 'Madagascar', well, it just didn't work for me. But 'Over The Hedge' does something, that previous Dreamworks features didn't do. It works with characters a little bit. This time, they really stopped, and thought about the voices. Instead of picking random stars for completely inappropriate characters, the creators of 'Over The Hedge' found actors that perfectly match their animated characters.There's a little something for everyone in 'Over The Hedge'. There's originality, there's some really sharp humor, slick animation and what is very crucial, it has heart. 'Over The Hedge' is a film not just for the kids, but for their parents too, everyone will have a laugh and no one will be disappointed (hopefully, at least).Overall, it's a fun adventure and a step forward for Dreamworks Animation.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"With likable characters and a well-written story, Over the Hedge is the gateway to the good life in it's 20th anniversary","In 1998, DreamWorks Animation made their very first CGI animated feature film Antz alongside The Prince of Egypt. Both did very well with critical acclaim and a cast of talented actors. However, their last three traditional animated feature films under-performed (leaving The Road to El Dorado to bomb), so they decided to make more CGI animated features to compete against Pixar. With the success of Shrek and Madagascar in 2001 and 2005, they released another feature based on the 1995 comic strip known as ""Over the Hedge"".It tells the story about RJ (Bruce Willis), a scheming raccoon who tries to steal some food from a bear named Vincent (Nick Nolte). However, the wagon that carries the food got crushed by a truck and RJ vows to get more food at the suburbs before the bear would kill him. One day, he comes across forest critters who discover a hedge that leads them to the neighborhood filled with people. After meeting RJ, they team up to get more food to last the entire spring and summer while the raccoon learns about family himself.I was twelve years old when this film came out and I saw it in theaters. I loved it as much as everyone else until Kung Fu Panda and How To Train Your Dragon came out and those became my favorite films DreamWorks has made. Don't get me wrong. This movie is really funny, but before I can give it some praise, I only have two problems with it.First is the animation. It used to be great when it came out, but it's sad to say that it hasn't aged well. The visuals still hold up, but the character animation is a bit too stiff. It wasn't until 2010 when DreamWorks Animation improved on their animation by going into full detail in the character designs and visuals. Tim Johnson, who directed this film and Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas before it, went on to direct the Kung Fu Panda Holiday Special and Home, both films that have much more detailed animation. The animation here isn't terrible, but like I said, it still doesn't hold up. Second, there are some moments that felt a bit forced aside from the film's memorably funny moments including Hammy's crazy rabid squirrel scene and such.Now, with those flaws out of the way, everything else is great. The characters are likable especially RJ and the forest critters, Verne, Lou, Penny, the three porcupine kids, Heather, Ozzie, Stella, and of course Hammy which everyone loves. They share the film's hilarious moments while delivering the drama really well. Gladys Sharp, the human character, isn't exactly special, but she wasn't annoying. Dwayne the exterminator and Vincent the bear, however, are really fine villains, with Thomas Hayden Church delivering some of the funny lines while Nick Nolte shines in his menacing presence. The story line, despite some of the forced moments, is well-written and teaches the lesson about the true meaning of family in which the execution works, giving the film some heart in the process.And of course, the humor which has some of the best moments DreamWorks Animation has made including the conversation between Tiger, a guard cat and Stella, the skunk, and Hammy stealing the show as the most hilarious and adorable little squirrel in the history of mankind. Aww. I just want to hug him. OK, I'm getting ahead of myself.Overall, Over the Hedge isn't nearly as solid as the later films DreamWorks has made like say Kung Fu Panda, How To Train Your Dragon, Rise of the Guardians, Madagascar 3 and the first two Shrek films, but on it's 20th anniversary, it's still a really good film. It's funny, heartwarming, and very likable. This receives a thumbs up from me. :)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The music is great, especially the theme song by Ben Folds and Hans Zimmer. Lots of action and adventure to keep you glued to the screen. Great jokes and observations of humans, stemming from the comic strip it's based on. The stars doing the voices helped make the movie come alive. Phenomenal voice acting by Bill Shatner as one of the opossums -- I didn't see an opossum when it was talking, I saw Bill acting! See it! Buy it -- the amount of computer servers Dreamworks used to make this and the technological complexity of it is mind blowing.

"Another clever, cute  and extremely funny animation movie","Do you remember a time when kids movies used to be unbearably kitschy affairs with awful music and story lines that always evolved around a sad princess or animals that were supposed to be cute but were really so annoying you wanted to punch them in their little furry faces? Well, rejoice because those times seem to have gone for good ever since animation movies à la Pixar came along. ""Toy Story"" and ""Shrek"" were just the beginning of what turned out to be a whole new genre with room for a thousand funny ideas. Maybe it's the fact that with animated characters and landscapes directors don't have to deal with eccentric actors or with unpredictable changes in weather. Animation movies are so packed with creativity they give us hope that Hollywood really isn't as unimaginative and heartless as it may seem sometimes.""Over The Hedge"" continues this glorious tradition. Whereas most other animation movies included a lot of homages to motion picture classics, ""Over The Hedge"" relies mostly on its humor (if you discount the fact that the story in itself is a homage to classic heist movies such as ""Ocean's 11""). Again makers came up with a whole bunch of lovable little protagonists from RJ the raccoon to Hammy the squirrel (reminiscent of the squirrel from ""Ice Age"").The pacing is fast, the animation is perfect and the voice overs are good, too. If there's one thing to criticize it's that ""Over The Hedge"" is probably too much for kids. The ending gets quite turbulent and the story includes some plotpoints that may be hard to get for children under 12.Anyway, ""Over The Hedge"" is a great pleasure to watch and even though it's not quite as great as the big movies of the genre (""Ice Age"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Finding Nemo""), it's a more than worthy addition to the lot.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A wonderful movie. Could have been made by Pixar.,"A boring afternoon. Must wait in that big mall from 1 to 5 before going back home. Shopping is fun, but shopping for 4 hours without money is plain boring. So, what will I do? Going to the theater, of course. SO let's see: X-men 3, Already seen. MI3, already seen. A Hilary Duff movie? No way! A animation movie made by Dreamworks? Why not.But I have to say I wasn't expecting much from Dreamworks. Sure, they Made Shrek 1&2, which are excellent movie, but Madagascar was just boring, with childish animation and not-that-funny jokes.Anyway, I went to see Over the hedge and I was laughing SO much, everybody else in the theater would have killed me (if there weren't only three to five people in the theater and they wasn't laughing as mush as me ) First, the characters are well-rounded, fleshed-out and extremely funny. The story is very good, with a good dose of humor mixed with small doses of criticism and pop-culture reference (but not too much). And when do you see a animated movie's character as emotionally complex as RJ ? In conclusion, it's a wonderful movie. The story is of Pixar-quality, but the animation are not quite at the level of Pixar (but Pixar is originally Canadian, so...oops, I think a little bit of patriotism slipped here. Sorry)but very good all-the-same.The DVD's going out soon, so watch Over the Hedge. It really worth the price.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Recent upsurges of comedic cartoon-films over recent years have produced a mixed reaction - this is one of the better ones,"Recent upsurges of comedic cartoon-films over recent years have produced a mixed reaction; Shrek 2 is possibly the greatest cartoon film ever however, this has been followed up with Madagascar and The Wild ('inter alia') which haven't lived up to the standard set by Shrek 2. This movie certainly does! From the overview, the cast didn't look exceptional thus we could draw relationships with flops such as Madagascar. Bruce Willis was the only 'larger' name alongside William Schatner  neither of which stimulate me. This film also saw Avril Lavigne's debut as an actor (or as a voice-over to be more precise). Despite this rather uninspiring and experimental cast this film turned out to be exceptional.The plot: RJ (a raccoon,) is a scavenger and tries to steal food of a bear (Vincent played by Nick Nolte). The bear catches RJ and threatens to eat him if he doesn't replace all of his food in a week. In order to do this, RJ has to make friends with some scavengers, namely a Turtle called Verne (played by Garry Shandling), an overexcited hamster called hammy (played by Steve Carell), a skunk with an attitude problem called Stella (played by Wanda Sykes), two possums called Ozzie and Heather (played by William Schatner and Avril Lavigne) and a few hedgehogs; Lou, Penny, Bucky, Spike and Quillo (played by Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Sami Kirkpatrick, Shane Baumel and Madison Davenport).The scavengers have been in hibernation for a few months. They wake up and learn redevelopers have cut down their beloved forest and begin to worry about gathering food. Fortunately, RJ is on the scene and the scavengers learn how to steal food from humans (who are over the hedge). This is a comedic story is based on a concoction of how RJ tries cheating his newly found family into giving him all the collected food from over the hedge so he can save his own life from a hungry bear, the battle between an bigoted insane woman (who calls in the 'verminator') and the animals' interpersonal relationships within the 'family' with strong referencing to Verne's tingling tail and its relationship with RJ.Throughout the plot, there are some fantastic displays from Hammy, Stella and Lou in particular. Watch out for Avril Lavigne's Heather who I think is also exceptional in her debut role. Despite the warning signs that this was going to be a particular poor film it has turned out to be completely the opposite  something which must go into the 'Shrek 2' class of films. I think the directors Karey Kirkpatrick and Tim Johnson have got the cast spot on and directed it so well! It is a laugh a minute from the start to the finish with fantastic characters, fantastic narratives and clever twists during essential comedic moments  it has something for everyone. Watch it or miss out, it really is that good!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Rj was the best character in the movie - without him, the movie wouldn't be a movie! He makes the movie what it is, and he is what makes the movie so dang hilarious. His sarcasm and cuteness makes me love the movie the way i do. So if you haven't seen this movie, What are you waiting for!? Go see it now!!!~Nicki~ PS: I LOVE R.J.!!!!!!

"An awesome film for everyone, especially the kids.","I watched this movie when I was 7. It was funny and cool. RJ, Hammy, and the three young porcupines are my favorite characters. Stella and Verne are okay characters. As for Vincent, he's definitely an evil bear who wants to kill and eat RJ if he doesn't bring him back his food before the full moon. The craziness part is when RJ and the animals started to steal food from people's houses, which prompted Gladys Sharp, president of the home owners' association, to call the exterminator to deal with the animals. Bruce Willis and Steve Carell are great voices actors in this movie. Wanda Sykes, Thomas Haden Church, and Allison Janney were great voice actors also. I'm sure a lot of families and their are gonna love this movie, especially if they're animal lovers.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
I loved this film,"Although this film appears to be aimed at children, I viewed it with my husband to decide whether it is suitable for my grandchildren, whose ages range from 2 to 7 years.I found the whole film funny, poignant, clever and thought-provoking although the 'message' only dawned on me later i.e. if you build on green-belt you should expect forest animals in your garden.I loved the development of the characters through the film and it definitely stands a second viewing. The graphics are brilliant, and the use of modern technology, e.g. the satellite navigation, in the content of the film, adds value.My husband fell off the couch laughing and for that I am grateful.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nice animation movie,"The plot of the movie was nice, it's a simple animation movie for kids, nothing wow. The storyline was fine, just a basic movie for children. The characters (the animals) were very funny. The location of the movie was very good, I loved the forest and the town. The graphics were well designed and I really liked them. There were some very funny scenes (for example, the one with the house destruction). The ending was nice, actually every animated movie has a nice ending.

One of the funniest animated films I've ever seen,"Over The Hedge is a movie made by DreamWorks that I actually enjoy. Mostly because it's freaking hilarious from start to finish. The humor is frequently cartoonish and clever, with slapstick that's inventive and cultural references that will make adults giggle. Sure, the story is very predictable, but that's about all I think is bad about this animated gem. The standout here is Hammy, a hyperactive squirrel that is voiced by the comedy legend of all, Steve Carell. He will make you laugh so hard in this that you will be in tears(ex. the energy drink scene, the impersonation of a squirrel with rabies). The animation is also vivid and colorful, with the textures and fur improving over Madagascar. The villain of the movie is voiced by Nick Nolte, and he is ruthless and awesome in his role. Overall, despite a generic plot, Over The Hedge is an uproariously funny, well-voiced, and great looking animated comedy that is a rare winner from DreamWorks.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A for adorable and amusing,"""Over the Hedge"" is surely a very entertaining animation for both - children and adults. I'd say that this is probably one of the best animations from big production companies alongside with Ice Age, Shrek, Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo. They've done a great job animating those animals. The characters are all adorable (very true to like fur and thorns + extremely big blue and emotional eyes). Movie gives a lot of true laughs. Little ones giggled over the cinema. This movie also teaches what truly matters in this life. I also noticed that children liked the musical score. Some of them started to clap their hands silently and hopped on their seats. And I truly liked the voiceovers. Very well and wisely chosen cast. Outstanding performances from Bruce Willis (RJ) and Steve Carell (Hammy). Overall rating - 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A delightful adventure that adults will enjoy as much as kids will.,"From Dreamworks Animation Studios comes 'Over The Hedge'.This is simply a fun animated movie that should not be seen by just kids but also by adults.There is absolutely nothing in this movie that not one kid or adult of any age should not enjoy.What is there not to like or love? The animation is Oscar worthy, every character is simply fantastic, the story is delightful, and the humor is fun and very entertaining.I'm sure that kids will enjoy the potty humor, but older people will be laughing at it themselves.Ah, what a great movie.It really wouldn't hurt if there was going to be an 'Over The Hedge' sequel.I can see millions of dollars grossing at the box office and tons of people clapping and cheering if there were a sequel.Until then, give 'Over The Hedge' a check and you just might wish for a sequel.I give it a solid 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

This Generations Family Classic,"When this movie was just coming to theaters, I thought that the previews were hilarious. So I got some of my friends together, and we went to the theater to see it. But something prevented us from seeing it and we left.

Now I look back and regret not seeing it in theaters.I grew up with the Classic Disney animated films, and I still re-watch those classics all the time. I respect what this movie did, not only was it hilarious, it had two good messages 1: ""Family and Friends are the Gateway to the Good-Life"", and 2: ""You can get away with anything if you put your mind to it"".

Great for Adults... and Kids!,"I have seen a few animated movies, The Incredibles, Shrek 1&2, Shark Tale, Nemo, Curse of the Were Rabbit, Monsters, Inc, Toy Story 1&2 and more. This movie is one of my top three animated favorites. I have seen it three times, and it keeps getting better. I actually found it only above average the first time, but probably because I saw it alone. Don't see it alone! I can watch it aloe now, and find it hilarious. It is more of a movie for adults, with enough fun and a good enough pace to keep kids highly entertained as well. There is a lot of humor that will go over their head, but tastefully enough that you won't worry about having to explain it to the kids. It's not crude, just life experience stuff. I put this movie right up there with Shrek and Nemo (my other two in my top three). Pay particular attention to everything the squirrel says, and everything that is said to him. It will pay off later.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Rockin' the Suburbs,"Over the Hedge is a cute movie that takes no prisoners in mocking suburbia and all that comes with it. The storyline is adequate and the voices are well done. Steve Carell's Hammy the hyperactive squirrel can be a little irritating at times but in the end is a very lovable character. He also stars in a great scene after he chugs an energy drink. Wandy Sykes is stellar as Stella the skunk.The movie is a fun, heartwarming tale of family and togetherness. When RJ the Racoon (portrayed by Bruce Willis) steals a bear's supply of food he has a limited amount of time to re-gather all of that food or face the angry bear's wrath. When he stumbles across an unsuspecting mishmash of a family of animals he sees a golden opportunity to gain some assistance in his task.Ripe with riffs of suburban American life, Over the Hedge delivers a good family film that is as much fun for adults as it is for kids.7 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Go on, Take a Peek","Who would've thought Bruce Willis would be playing a troubled NYPD officer and a mischievous raccoon both in the same year? Well he has, and done both quite well. Bruce Willis, along with Eugene Levy, Nick Nolte, Wanda Sykes, & many others appear in the all-new Dreamworks animation, 'Over the Hedge'. Which is brought to us by the director of 1998's 'Antz', Tim Johnson, and the producer of last year's hit 'Madagascar' and the writer of the upcoming 'Charlotte's Web', Karey Kirkpatrick.In 'Over the Hedge' we are taken into what is left of some woodland creature's home, now invaded by suburban life and surrounded by an encompassing hedge. They now have a dilemma. Where are they going to find food? That's where Bruce Willis' character, RJ the raccoon comes in. He explains to them on the other side of the hedge that there are plenty of delicious varieties of food. Including Hammy the squirrel's (Steve Carell) new favorite, nacho cheese flavored chips. While Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling) is skeptical and warns the others that it isn't safe over the hedge they all go along with RJ anyways in hopes of retrieving tasty treats. What they are unaware of is that RJ only wants to gather food for a hungry bear (Nick Nolte) so he himself doesn't get killed.'Over the Hedge' is nowhere near other animated films like 'Shrek' and 'Toy Story' in terms of greatness. It lacks a certain quality that is inexplicable. But its still highly enjoyable. The animation itself is very good, there's lots of funny moments for both children and adults to enjoy, and the story is good. (Although there are a few flaws in it, but nothing major.) The good thing is 'Over the Hedge' isn't being made out to be what those other films were. From being based on a comic strip it sure turned out to be pretty good. If you haven't seen it already, I suggest you take some time and go see what's over the hedge. You might just see something you like.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A really underrated cute animated movie. Worth anyones time,"Over the hedge is based on a children's book and one of which I have never read. The movie was made by DreamWorks animation who aren't well known to have made top notch animated films all of the time compared to say Pixar. But DreamWorks in my opinion have made good/great films such as Shrek 1/2, kung Fu Panda1-3, how to train your dragons prince of Egypt, rise of the guardians, spirit etc. Over the hedge in my eyes is underrated and is of the company's better movies. The storyline is simple but entertaining, funny, cute and has good morals about family. The animation looks great, the music in it is good even tho it uses a lot of songs from other sources, the humour is funny with it being a hit most of the time, the characters are likable and well done (tho a few could've been more flashed out) The voice acting is good and it fits the characters well. The film isn't perfect due to it being really short, some of the jokes don't work and more characters could've used more development. Overall if you like animated movies and are looking for something to get laugh out of I do recommend this movie. It's one of DreamWorks good ones and I rank it much higher then the likes of shark tale and bee movie",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very clever movie with some cutting lines about how we live,"I am not someone that can go to a movie and not get involved in the film.

Totally funny movie, totally one of the best this year for the kids and a MUST BUY ON DVD film, which is not something I say a lot. Willis is brilliant, as is Steve Carell, but then you really can't fault any of the voices, all of them worked fine for me. I can't write fancy reviews, no long words, great long sentences, but how many words to do kids needs when they tell you, ""can we go see that film again dad..

It was fun to see them interact with the lovable animals of the hedge, each bringing their own quirks and personalities to the group dynamic.The story was engaging and had a great message about teamwork, friendship, and the importance of family. The jokes were clever and had me laughing out loud, while the action sequences kept me on the edge of my seat.

Satirical examination of food consumption,"I am currently completing my PhD on the topic of psychoactive substance use and am hoping to use a quote from this movie to highlight the fact that a Christian ideology can lead to all-or nothing use of substances. That is, pleasure is seen as sinful, and thus, an ethic of moderation cannot be fostered. As a satirical examination of food consumption practices, and thus, a caricature of society, this is clearly highlighted when RJ the Racoon states ""for humans, enough is never enough"". Indeed, throughout the movie, insight into the ideals of Western society are clearly highlighted through humour. As Wittgenstein so elegantly tells us, the significance can be found only in the insignificant. This is true for the humour within this movie and the subsequent profound implications that can be missed due to its subtly.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Have we found the perfect PG rated animated film ??!!!!,"Let me tell you I went into this movie with very high expectations. However I did prepare in advance by going with I felt was the right company THERE IS NOTHING LIKE GOING WITH GIRLS FOR A PG RATED ANIMATED FILM (especially if your a 23 yr old guy who likes such films trust almost all my guy friends will cry 100 times before seeing this movie).Finding the appropriate company I entered the theater fully expecting my to be letdown a little bit. BUT......This movie is one the rear movies that met my expectations in each and every department.1)The animation was the best in the industry the characters looked life like and still retained their cartoonish charm.2)The Humour had something in it for everybody AND I MEAN EVERYBODY, their was intelligent and thought provoking humour ( If it tastes this good it has to be good for you, the American greed etc etc), crude slap-stick humour (the dog chase scene and more), adult humour (find my nuts...., Artificial food, Au natural etc Surprisingly NOT ONE JOKE HIT UNDER THE BELT YET I'm SURE THEY WERE AUDLT JOKES AS ONLY ADULTS WOULD GET THEM (hell unlike some other animated movie you would actually be able to explain it to your kid without getting embarrassed or lying), humour for the teens and preteens ( Auto-homicide 3, bonus points, THE ABOSULUETELY HILARIOUS TAKE ON A POPULAR PRETEEN MOVIE/SERIAL ABOUT SPEED), universal humour ( The monopoly scene clearly displayed their understanding of human psyche),The spoofs (terminator, the way teen girls speak etc etc),You Get the Point Don't You.I'M SORRY BUT EACH AND EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC WAS THOUGHT OF AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I AM NOT COMPLAINING.3)The sound-effects and voice-overs were excellent special credit for Bruce Willis for trying such a different role ,but each and every person in this movie was memorable, HAMMY is heading for legendary status which will be comparable to THE RAT from Ice Age.4)The emotional scenes were expertly handled EVEN THE MOST PROFOUND SCENES WERE MADE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE SMILE WAS NEVER WIPED OF YOUR FACE, yet somehow the importance of family values was clearly put across. There were the typical scenes where the girls went AWWWWWWWWWW but even those were cool and as I had come prepared I felt great about my foresight.5)The theater was filled a variety of people (even a burkha clad women with her children, and an elderly couple) and each and everyone was laughing a couple of scenes had me falling out of my seat.Now for the bad parts.................................I'm SORRY BUT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS FILM. I have scaled down the rating for only 2-3 unimportant reasons.1)This movie is no pioneer in animated films.2)I sure this movie will be loved by all but I'm not sure if it will THIS FUNNY FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH American CULTURE.3) Nothings Perfect (But i swear if I meet person over 40 who is not familiar with American culture and who claims he loved this movie I will upgrade this movie to a perfect ten).A must see movie no matter who you are or who you go with, however going with company that includes girls will ensure enjoyment as the oohs and aahs will add extra special effects hehe.Don't waste any more time and go watch this movie.+s absolutely everything+/-s can it actually be loved by every kind audience still looking for that answer.-s absolutely nothing total 9-9.9/10 cause nothings perfect.!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Well-written funny farce with moments of pure genius,"When the movie isn't making you smile, it's making you laugh out right. The voice talent is the best I have heard in a long string of CGI cartoons of late. Well cast, Shandling and Willis are stand outs but Hammy, voiced by superstar Steve Carell, steals the show.The feel of the entire movie is that of Warner Brother's classic Bugs and company flicks of the 40s. Unexpected funny moments that bloom into absurd (i.e. the skunk dousing the house, views from the planet and general wacky thoughts) visuals make this one easy to watch over and over again.Kudos to the segment on ""Humans obsession with food"". RJ explains how we pray to food, dress up like food and consume more than we need. Whichever writers came up with the idea deserves a raise.Lastly, I could watch or listen to Wanda Sykes read a toothpaste tube -- she's that good. Can't end this review without mentioning the self-parody of William Shatner's over dramatic performance as Ozzie. He is truly an American icon.Don't miss this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

He found some ""primitive animals"" on the wild and convinces then to find food for RJ.I have seen this as a kid but I just didn't understand it well and after seeing as an adult, from RJ lying to manipulating it shows everything like in real life.

I absolutely love this movie!!,"I am a viewer that really enjoys humorous animated movies, I find them really entertaining and comforting. First watching this in elementary on repeat with my older brother, I can say it is an outstanding movie to enjoy on your own or with others. Personally I think this movie can be directed towards different age groups and, I wouldn't classify it as a ""Childs movie"". Although, I can see how it can be viewed as such since the movie is filled with a bunch of animated animals. The film has excellent scenes that show a great representation of cutting into the forest for building purposes from the animals point of view. With the animals first interacting with real world things like cars and people, I found it fascinating to get their perspective on digging in the trash, breaking into homes for food, and discovering objects and how they work. I do enjoy watching the progression of the plot with getting to experience each personality throughout the film and the connection to the animals that the producer gives. Including actors like Wanda Sykes, as Stella and Steve Carell, as Hammy, and Avril Lavigne, as Heather was an appreciable touch, making each character standout with their own identity. As the animals experience new experiences, gadgets, and food; viewers get to enjoy their witty ways of foraging. It offers another perspective of forest demolition that humans don't consider much, instead of portraying the realistic views of what animals encounter. We get to watch a lighthearted interpretation of their perspective. The light of animals (we consider roadkill) finding a way to survive before the next winter is put into a comical entertaining animation is what makes me love this movie even more. This film is fairly similar to other movies like The Lorax, Chicken Run, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 and, Open Season with the amusing animated films that have a ""fight back"" for living in peace against a harmful force. This 4.5 out of 5 star movie is definitely recommended for an open minded viewer who's not only interested in watching horror, romantic, or action movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Eyeopening and ahead of it's time. Wish people would internalize this movie more and be more compassionate towards the nature around us.,"Great movie w impressive animation for the time and great story line really showing the very possible perspective of the animals that live in the environments that us humans choose to destroy and inhabit when they are trying to survive. Our perspective on food and food waste is also very interesting. Honestly a very fun movie with very good lessons to be learned about the human/animal experience. I mean we're all just animals trying to survive tbh right? This portrayal of humans and how we view these animals as 'vermin' raiding our trash cans is accurate and we see it from the animals perspective. Great way of bringing two worlds into one in a fun childlike, relatable way. Voice acting is spot on w the casting and this movie is highly underrated!

This Raccoon Is A Fast Food Addict!,"I really enjoyed this one. Also this is on of those beautifully scripted cartoon films with great all-round casting. The main character in this film is an adorable racoon called RJ (Bruce Willis), who accidentally obliterates a huge store of food which belongs to a bear called Vincent (Nick Nolte).Vincent gives RJ a week to replace the store of food. If RJ failed to accomplish this feat, Vincent vows to hunt him down and eat him.A frightened RJ finds small forested plot where a pack of hibernating animals have just awoken, surprised to find a large hedge that separates the forest from the human community. Verne the box turtle (Garry Shandling), the group's elder, urges the others to start stashing food for next year. RJ appears to the group and tells them they can collect all the food they will need within a week by raiding the humans' trash and homes. Verne is extremely pessimistic about crossing the hedge, but RJ is able to convince the others to join him.One of the big highlights in this animated film is Bruce Willis's voice acting is outstanding. He really gets into the act and seems to be enjoying voicing the character of RJ. The other voice actors complement him wonderfully, namely Garry Shandling, Wanda Sykes and Steve Carrell who voice-acts and adorable young squirrel named Hammy.In this cartoon you see the perspective from the animals and from the human's side. This film is jam-packed with good humor.Children and adults of all ages should find this animated film very appealing. And this one is DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Don't panic parents, this is actually funny for you too.","A clever raccoon decides to hoodwink various other woodland creatures to help him repay a debt. Meanwhile the local humans are making life tough for the animals...Another Madagascar style easy target film, although this one is better made, and even though they opted to fill the cast with ""names"" they do a pretty good job.The various creatures are all pretty cute and cuddly in the standard way but they all have a chance to show their true colours and character development is well handled. Being a pro-animal film there are a large number of digs at humans, especially our consumer tendencies and a lack of understanding of the real world.I must admit I had low expectations with this one but it was surprisingly easy to watch and there were even a couple of highlights at the tail end of the film that left me actually looking forward to seeing this again.What you hope kids will learn: Everyone needs to learn to co-exist, mainly humans.What they'll take away: That squirrel is car-azy!If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The animal characters were lovable and adorable, and their voice actors did a great job of bringing them to life. The graphics were attractive, which was appealing right from the off. My favourite thing about this film was that I felt emotionally attached to the animals; when they were upset, I was upset, and when they were celebrating, I was smiling with them.
If you're looking for a film to watch with your kids, then I suggest this one, because it is fun no matter how old you are!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
8 and over,"Over the Hedge is a wonderfully funny movie more oriented to children over 8. In the store I've seen some very young children going for this film and there are some questionable phrases and scenes. But other than that, the movie is an A1 accomplishment for the cartoon filming industry. Even if you don't recognize the voices, you can tell they are seasoned actors because of the excellent inflection, tone, and cadence. While the plot isn't the most intelligent one you could think of, the delivery is great. The cartooning is also top notch with very few shortcuts in the design. A great movie for everyone over 8, maybe a little scary for those under 8.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Yes, i bought the DVD.","Let's be honest here, I wasn't really expecting much when i was dragged to the cinema but my younger brother.I was pleasantly surprised. Not only does the film keep its humour throughout the whole length of the movie but the voice over's were a blow away. RJ, the raccoon voiced over by Willis is somewhat, knwoledgebly street smart in comparison to gary Shandling's dry humour. However, it is not these characters that steal the show. Hammy the hamster voiced by Steve carrell was an absolute star to watch.The plot delivers, the humour delivers, the DVD delivers. What more could you ask for? go buy it now..",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why is this film not nominated for Oscar?,"Far superior to this year's other ""Nature vs. Man"" animated film, Open Season, Over the Hedge is a witty, visually astounding comedy feast. The voice cast is uniformly great (even Bruce Willis, whom I was initially uncertain about, as the wily raccoon RJ). But it is Steve Carell's manic performance as the squirrel Hammy that steals every scene. (Honorable mentions must also be made of Wanda Sykes as the feisty skunk Stella, Thomas Hayden Church as the obsessive exterminator, Dwayne, and William Shatner as a hilariously over-the-top possum named Ozzie.) This film was definitely better than the year's ""biggest"" animated movie, Cars, and should have been in the running for the Best Animated Feature Oscar. (I guess the only reason I wouldn't give OTH a 10/10 rating is that it's not quite on Lion King/Finding Nemo level. But if you haven't already, check this movie out; you won't be disappointed.) Rating: 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very good and excellent movie,This is the first movie that I've ever seen twice in the theater. I'd like to go see it again. But that would be overkill. Mostly with Gas prices being like they are.Hammy really stole my heart.The only thing that I can say that was a disappointment was the length of this movie. It should have been a little bit longer.Over all. I had fun. My cousin who I saw it with first laughed right along with me. Then my friend laughed.There's one part that might scare small children. But lets just say that it's within 10 minutes of the movie.It was the dream scene.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Right up there with Shrek,"This movie is great. The stand out performances for me were Bruce Willis and Steve Carell. Most of the animals were cute and cuddly.The best jokes were the cheese bomb, Hammy being the only person in the world who was moving, and when R.J. was describing how humans live to eat. Clever!Other than the stand outs the cast was good. Nick Nolte was good as Vincent, William Shatner was funny as the possum. Avril Legvine was good as the daughter. Wanda Sykes was good, too. Gary Sandling was good, but I just preferred R.J. over his character.9 out of 10. Funny movie. Don't miss.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Well-executed comedy and appealing animation,"Over the Hedge is an animated comedy released in 2006. Karey Kirkpatrick and Tim Johnson are the film's directors. It is based on the comic strip of the same name by Michael Fry and T. Lewis. The movie tells the story of a group of woodland creatures who awaken from their winter hibernation to find a large suburban neighborhood has taken over their habitat. They must navigate the dangers of the human world and ultimately learn to coexist with their new neighbors.One of the strengths of ""Over the Hedge"" is its humor. The film is filled with clever dialogue, slapstick comedy, and pop culture references that appeal to both children and adults. The voice cast, which includes Bruce Willis, Garry Shandling, Steve Carell, and Wanda Sykes, brings the characters to life with their comedic timing and delivery. The interactions between the various animals are entertaining and often result in hilarious situations.The animation in ""Over the Hedge"" is vibrant and visually appealing. The characters are well-designed and have distinct personalities that are reflected in their appearance and movements. The filmmakers effectively use the contrast between the lush natural environment of the animals and the neat, manicured lawns of the suburban neighborhood to emphasize the clash between the two worlds.Beyond its comedic elements, ""Over the Hedge"" also carries an underlying message about consumerism and the impact of humans on the environment. The film explores the themes of greed, materialism, and the loss of natural habitats, presenting them in a way that is accessible to young audiences without being overly preachy. It encourages viewers to consider the consequences of their actions and the importance of finding a balance between human needs and environmental preservation.While ""Over the Hedge"" is an enjoyable and entertaining film, some may find its plot to be fairly predictable. The story follows a relatively formulaic structure, and certain plot developments can be anticipated early on. However, the film compensates for this with its humor and endearing characters, which keep the audience engaged throughout.Overall, ""Over the Hedge"" is a delightful animated film that combines humor, heart, and a relevant environmental message. It entertains with its well-executed comedy and appealing animation while also encouraging viewers to reflect on their relationship with nature. Whether you're a child or an adult, this film offers an enjoyable experience for all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really Great Movie,"It's very entertaining for the grown-ups as well for the kids. Not the best animated film, but a solid one though. The graphics are great. The plot is good though. It's definitely great for kids. I would definitely recommend this film for kids. It's one of the greatest DreamWorks movies. It would be very nice if there was a continue to the story but the creators are considering making a sequel as they had a lot of fun with the characters during production, but at this stage, nothing has been confirmed. Even though the movie it's not so violent as they say but still has some Violence and Gore in it. If you've not seen the movie yet, what are you waiting for?",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Something your kids can learn,"I'm oh-so-bored with cartoons giving the big message that the family is the most important thing in the world. And it felt a bit like this is gonna be another one, with the loving family of possums, porcupines, turtle and squirrel (biologically a bit weird...) Luckily, this is just one of the messages, and not the central one, either.It's just so great that finally not only serious documentaries but animation films for kids also tackle the issue of consumerism. I think it's terribly important that they are faced with criticism of extreme consumption and what it does to the environment - and to us. Maybe even for adults it's worth thinking over. At least the humans in the story are depicted as stupid, though dangerous, as opposed to the funny but lovely animals. (I find this realistic, too.) The jokes work pretty well not just for children but also for adults, though you need to be good at film history with some of them. And I'm sure I'd have understood much more if the film hadn't been dubbed - but this is really not their fault.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best animated movie since Shrek!,"CGI movies seem to be a new fad these days in Hollywood. It seems every other week another one hits theaters. Im sure I don't have to tell you that not all of them have lived up to the standards of Shrek or Toy Story. Before watching this I thought it was just another one of those with an ensemble cast, like shark tale. Man was I wrong! This is a great movie that people of all ages will enjoy. The cast fits the characters perfectly, from Bruce Willis as RJ the raccoon to Steve Carrell as hammy the squirrel. The jokes in the movie are aimed for kids and they're actually funny! The animation is top notch as well, you can actually get a characters emotion by the way their eyes move. The only problem i had with this movie is that it was a little too predictable, but still worth watching. Out of all the animated movies of 2006, Over the Hedge is definitely my favorite. If you're looking for a good family movie with a great story, check this one out. I haven't had this much fun watching an animated movie since Shrek!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Food, glorious food!!","What an enjoyable movie! There probably won't be a lot of surprises, and yes it can be argued this follows a formula set down by previous animated movies, but it all comes together in a highly enjoyable romp.The voices are well cast for the characters, the animation is good, and the story is fun. The fact that there are things you hear but not see that will make you laugh is good, and I like the fact they have the originators of the comic strip as voices as well.IF I had any complaints, it would be limited to the following: 1.) Gary Shandling just doesn't lend any sense of urgency to the couple of scenes that need it. All the other characters convey urgency, and his character (Verne) gets more worked up in other scenes that this. 2.) Bruce Willis does a great job, but if I recall Jim Carrey was originally tagged for his role (RJ), and that might have made it a little better. Hard to say.This movie is safe for the entire family. There isn't anybody who should be at all offended by this movie...except possibly anyone who actually presides over a Residents Association!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is really non fiction related and accurate,"Nothing can copy this movie. its really cool and at the same time very educating on telling the events of the movie and relating it to real life.

Sumary for OVER THE HEDGE,"A really great movie with an all-star cast, including William Shatner, Nick Norte, Bruce Willis, Avril Lavigne and Eugene Levy. In OVER THE HEDGE, RJ, a sneaky, greedy, raccoon, steals a huge pile of junk food from Vincent the Grizzly Bear, who gives him one week to get it back. RJ plans a plot, and with the help of some neighbourhood animals, including Verne the shy turtle and Hammy the crazy squirrel, plans to steal all the food from the humans' houses. However, there is an exterminator on the animals' trail, who will stop at nothing to get rid of them. Will RJ return Vincents food, or will he be squashed to bits by the exterminator? You have to watch the movie to find out!!!! OVER THE HEDGE is a very hilarious, funny movie, and it's not just for kids either.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Watchable animation, good for kids","The plot line for 'Over the Hedge' is simple: Animals fight humans to get food. Perhaps if this film had come out a few years ago, I might have had high praise for it. The animation quality is good, there's plenty of light banter and some genuinely funny jokes. Yet the film has that 'been there seen that' look about it that seems to plague most talking animal cartoons. Nick Nolte's voice work is the most distinguished, everyone else feels average by comparison. There is nothing particularly memorable about this film, though kids will undoubtedly love it.Overall 6/10",,Anonymous,Animation
better than some,"Hammy the hyperactive squirrel is the funniest thing in it But its ending is weak a syrupy ending about friendship solving everything It lacks characters and the art is to very good Its consists of cinema and post modern jokes but no staying power that comes with narrative this is a diatribe against American consumerism and nachos and junk food beginning with an explosion of nachos as epic as an atom bomb such is its effect on the animals. this inspires them to seek out more which means abandoning their natural habitat and entering the world f humans. Thanklfully hue humans have thoughtfully destroyed their habitat while they were hibernating as an invitation to come and infest their homes. This may not be as funny as some of the CGI works and again is tying to balance irony jokes for the adults with scatological the kids, Bruce Willis's voice-over for the raccoon raises the film",,Anonymous,Animation
"Great acting, story and characters.  A fun(nny) animated movie","Over the Hedge's story centers around a raccoon named R.J. (Bruce Willis). R.J. needs to give back everything he tried to steal from a bear, but ended up losing and he only has a week to do it. R.J. makes a list of everything that he lost before he sets out. After traveling a bit he stumbles upon a close knit group of animals who just found half of their forest and most of their food supplies gone and a suburban neighborhood in it's place. R.J. sees an opportunity and after introducing them to the human food recruits them to help him regain all the lost food for the bear. Of course he doesn't tell them this, they think that they are gathering food for themselves. But the groups leader, a turtle named Verne (Gary Shandling) has his doubts.The main reason that I wanted to see this movie was because of the voice talent, Bruce Willis and William Shatner in particular. I have never seen a movie or T.V. episode with those two in it that I didn't like and they are among my favorite actors. They did not disappoint me; they preformed their parts well. Also the rest of the cast did an exceptional job. This is a movie that you know is going to be fun to watch just by looking at it. It has clever humor, good acting and an engaging plot. The animation is also great. If you decide to see it, rent the DVD and check out the special features explaining how they did some of the animation. It is very fascinating. The writing was very good for an animated family film. The writers make up for the sometimes formulaic characters by making the plot unpredictable and even exciting at parts.This movie isn't without its problems. It has many jokes that kids might find funny (which is perfectly fine if you are bringing your kids) but will make older people roll their eyes. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with these jokes being in thereit's an animated movie so its main audience is going to be kids but I wish they would cut back on them. They never had those jokes in Looney Tunes or those old cartoons. For the most part adults can watch old cartoons eye rolling free. But new cartoons spoon-feed kids bizarre, unoriginal, overused, stupid and unfunny jokes that drive any sane person nuts. That was just a rant about recent animation in general and is not really directed at this movie by the way. I don't care for some of the humor styles of today.But overall this movie remains entertaining and was really one of the best animated films of the year. Being based on a comic strip that was a satirical look at the human lifestyle this movie has quite a few jokes that many people will give a guilty if not hearty chuckle to. I highly recommend it especially to families.87%",,Anonymous,Animation
