Winslet Impressive In This Two-Movies-In-One Story,"Kate Winslet is just outstanding in this very interesting film that is almost two stories-in-one. The first part is a sexual story of an older woman having affairs with a teenage boy and the second part is her war crimes tale and what happens afterward. The first is a somewhat happy jaunt of a short story and the second is a very serious and depressing story. That's where Winslet really shines. Obviously, she's developed into an an outstanding actress.The second part is what most people, I assume, will remember about this film. Can ""Hanna Schmitz,"" a Nazi employee (so to speak), who was part of concentration camps, be a sympathetic character? To me, that's what it looked like that's the question the story was asking. The answer may have come in the final minutes of the movie when her ex-lover ""Michael Berg,"" now grown up and played by Ralph Fiennes, confronts a survivor of the camp. That, too, was very intense and interesting scene. Lena Olin is riveting as ""Rose/Illana Mather.""""The Reader"" was full of quiet, but intense scenes. This is a very thought-provoking film, especially for one that doesn't start off that way but look almost like some soft-porn flick to get our attention. It is anything but that.For Germans, this film must bring out many emotions and thoughts. Guilt and forgiveness are just two of the issues that are dealt with in this unique film. ""Hanna Schmitz"" turns out to be an incredibly simple-yet-complex person, unlike any I've encountered on film in a long time. You see her in all kinds of light, both good and bad.Kudos, too, to David Kross' acting as the young Michael Berg. It must be strange for someone his age (barely turned 18) to do the scenes he did with 30-something Winslet.Overall, a very different and excellent film that stays with you and makes you ponder its main characters.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Right and Wrong,"Post-WWII Germany: Nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, law student Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) re-encounters his former lover (Kate Winslet) as she defends herself in a war-crime trial.The film raises the question of whether we should judge someone by the law or rather ""the laws of the time"". And there is a big difference. Of course we know that killing is morally wrong, and those who sent people to death in World War II were morally in the wrong, even if they were only following orders.But were they legally wrong? One could argue not. That is a difficult topic. Like the women of this film, those at the Nuremberg Trial were tried and convicted under laws invented after the war. Laws written by the winners. This makes one wonder: is it right to put someone on trial for something morally wrong, even if it was not legally wrong? And who should decide the laws? Had the Axis won, they could have just as easily declared it illegal to drop atomic bombs on innocent villages and then try, convict and execute Harry Truman.Right and wrong is no easy topic.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An insight into the humanity of the inhumane,"Before I start reviewing, let me say something personal: As a German, one can hardly watch movies about the Holocaust, WWII or any related topic unbiased. As I have discovered myself, no German family is without a history related to the Third Reich, almost none are without grave guilt, or at least the fear thereof, and most who say otherwise either lie knowingly, or simply try to evade further inquiry.Reading some of the other reviews, I realized that for me, the movie conveyed something slightly, but decisively different: It is not so much about understanding HOW people could ever do the things they did, but rather how it is possible, that people we love, and people that have been loved by people we love could be so guilty and so loving, so despicable and lovable at the same time. It is about how we expect the guilt to show up somehow, how we expect to know the killer, the monster, at first sight and say: how could anyone not have seen it? Yet we have to admit sooner or later, that we were wrong, or were we? The question really is: How could I have ever loved someone who did things as horrible and disgusting as Hannah did? And just as much: If I am unmerciful now, having learned of their guilt, is it because they did what they did, or because they disappointed my own belief in their innocence?At one point, Hanna Schmitz asks the judge: ""What would you have done?"", and I think that therein lies an even more disturbing and unsettling question: What would I have done? What would you have done? How can anyone know for sure what WE would done? It is too easy to think of oneself as morally sound, with a firm belief in what is right and wrong. It's what Germans call the ""mercy of late birth"" - the luxury of not having been in the position to make that choice.So, what made this movie worth giving the full 10 points out of 10? It is well-crafted, well-played, believable, at times even beautiful. It captures both the fascination Michael feels with Hannah, and his disbelief, even disgust while exploring the ugly truth about her past. It conveys the struggle between our compassion and the reluctance to show mercy against the ones who did not. It leaves the viewer with the same, disturbing questions that have not been answered sufficiently in the past 60 years (nor will they ever be). It does not provide simple answers, but rather raises more questions, left to be unanswered. As Lena Olin's Character says: ""If you want Catharsis, go to the theater!""Other than providing beautiful, well-toned cinematography, a well-written script, love of detail and convincing performances even by the supporting cast - what more can you expect from a truly great movie?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The Reader is a brilliant, sexually charged, and oddly heartbreaking tale about the complexity of human morality and the lifelong repercussions that result from our actions.","There's an urgency in human nature to understand. When it comes to the Holocaust, history's bleak, unsettling period, it doesn't matter what book you've read, film you've seen or account you've heard; in the end, your response it halted by its incomprehensible conclusion. How could humanity course its way towards such a violent, destructive path? How could people knowingly send men, women, and children to their impending doom? Most puzzling, how could the world allow it? Even though its been 63 years since the blood-drenched annals of World War II, its aftermath today is still bone chilling.After a six year celluloid dry spell, Stephen Daldry returns to the director's chair in a brilliant, sexually charged, and oddly heartbreaking tale about the complexity of human morality and the lifelong repercussions that result from our actions. Adapted from Bernhard Schlink's best-selling German novel, ""The Reader,"" Daldry's visual translation is a powerful, emotionally absorbing film that is one of the year's best. It's superbly crafted.With World War II over, Germany, in 1958, is still recovering. Deep within Heidelberg, Germany, Michael (David Kross), a young pubescent teenager haven fallen ill, is comforted by Hanna (Kate Winslet), a hard working woman who is twice his age. Taken by her generosity, Michael revisits Hanna to offer his gratitude. What begins as an awkward reunion escalates into a seductive, forbidden affair that intensifies when Michael begins reading to the distant, empty Hanna, who is deeply awakened by Michael's spoken literature. Too young to understand love's complicated implications, Michael is emotionally devastated when Hanna suddenly disappears. Nearly a decade later, unable to forget his passionate summer while studying law, he attends a Nazi trail, and to his dismay, hears Hanna's distant voice.""The Reader"" is a complex film; maybe a little too complex for some. Though the film pertains to Nazism and the ""sins of our fathers,"" in essence, ""The Reader"" is a film that reflects the emotions inside all of us. During a lecture, Michael's professor comments, ""Societies like to think they operate on morality but they don't."" In this cynical age, how far from reality is that statement? During Hanna's trial, she's questioned why she participated in the Nazi party's horrendous war crimes, broken she replies, ""It was my job."" Oddly enough, that seems to be the justification most people use. Surprisingly, though, ""The Reader"" isn't about her exposure as a war criminal, but an exposure on an individual who took the wrong path. She's not a bad person; she's simply made wrong choices. However, when it comes to having involvement in the Nazi's liquidation of the Jews, how ""wrong"" can you get? ""You ask us to think like lawyers,"" cries on student, ""what are we trying to do?"" A distraught Michael replies, ""We are trying to understand!"" But, just who exactly is trying to grasp a deeper understanding: the court or Michael? How can Hanna's past be forgiven? Director Stephen Daldry brings the much needed emotional layer that a character such as Hanna Schmitz desperately needs. Although her actions are beyond unforgivable, strangely, we sympathize with her. Maybe it's her other shameful secret. Maybe it's superb character development.""The Reader"" is a film that is driven by it's raw performances. In one of her finest hours, Kate Winslet gives the performance of a lifetime. It's a haunting and heart-breaking. David Kross, who's only 18, is impressive as the teenager with raging hormones; it's such a daring performance. Winselt and Kross bring this picture together. Their performances are jaw-droppingly brilliant. Completing the role of Michael, as the tortured grown man, is Ralph Fiennes, who balances Michael's despair through his melancholic emotion when he encounters a grown Jewish woman, played by Lena Olin, who was also at Hanna's trail. Although her scenes clock in less than 10 minutes, Olin, too, is breathtaking.When ""The Reader's"" credits rolled, I sat quietly shaken by what I had witnessed. It's a film that is impossible to forget. When a grown Michael asks Hanna, ""Have you spent much time thinking about the past?"" Heartbroken, she replies, ""It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter what I feel. The dead are still dead."" She's right.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Never underestimate the power of guilt,"Kate Winslet, I absolutely adore her, she's my favorite actress of all time. I still can't believe that she hadn't won an Oscar, her first nomination was in 1995 with Sense and Sensibility. Finally after 14 long years, she finally won the coveted award with the movie The Reader. I finally was able to see this movie the other day and it blew me away, I'm still debating if this really was my favorite Kate Winslet performance, but once again with a strong cast telling a powerful story, The Reader was definitely one of the best films out of 2008. So many holocaust films have been made, it's hard to make another that stands out, but we really haven't had a story where the Nazi guards were on trial. A lot of people debate if this movie is trying too hard to push sympathy on Kate Winslet's character, but my love for this film is to just show that they were human as well, hard to believe, but that our mothers, sisters, friends, whoever could have done something so shameful.Michael Berg in 1995 Berlin watches an S-Bahn pass by, flashing back to a tram in 1958 Neustadt. A teenage Michael gets off because he is feeling sick and wanders around the streets afterwards, finally pausing in the entryway of a nearby apartment building where he vomits. Hanna Schmitz, the tram conductor, comes in and assists him in returning home. The 36 year old Hanna seduces and begins an affair with the 15 year old boy. During their liaisons, at her apartment, he reads to her literary works he is studying. After a bicycling trip, Hanna learns she is being promoted to a clerical job at the tram company. She abruptly moves without leaving a trace. The adult Michael, a lawyer, at Heidelberg University law school in 1966. As part of a special seminar taught by Professor Rohl, a camp survivor, he observes a trial of several women who were accused of letting 300 Jewish women die in a burning church when they were SS guards on the death march following the 1944 evacuation of Auschwitz. Hanna is one of the defendants. Stunned, Michael visits a former camp himself. The trial divides the seminar, with one student angrily saying there is nothing to be learned from it other than that evil acts occurred and that the older generation of Germans should kill themselves for their failure to act then. But Michael is conflicted on what to do, if to speak out on Hannah's behalf on some of her innocence in the murders or keep quiet.This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen, it was so incredible and just heart breaking. One of the things I respected about the film was the way they handled the awkward ""love story"" between Michael and Hannah, she's older, he's younger, but it's not even a perverted thing, so strange to say that. I don't know how to put it exactly, but their connection was real and in some sense they both needed each other. If you have the chance to see this movie, I seriously suggest that you take it, the powerful performances really make this film captivating. The story is so heart wrenching and painful, but was told so well. Kate now finally has the award she's deserved for so long and pulls in a terrific performance with The Reader.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Reading, Writing and the Wonderful Kate","David Hare wrote one of my favorite female characters in ""Plenty"", Meryl Streep brought her to life in the most extraordinary way. Here, Hare writes another power house female character. It doesn't have the intellectual aspirations of ""Plenty"" but there is also a form of mental illness in his character. Kate Winslet is magnificent. Her early scenes with the wonderful David Kross are filled with compelling, contradictory and totally believable undertones. My misgivings are to be pinned on Stephen Daldry, the director. His sins as a filmmaker start to become a sort of trade mark, visible and palpable in the moving ""Billy Elliot"" and the shattering ""The Hours"" I can't quite pinpoint what it is but in ""The Reader"" that element is more obvious than in the other two. Maybe it has to do with loftiness. There are moments so frustratingly long and slow here that he lost me in more than one occasion. In any case, the cast makes this film a rewarding experience. Besides Kate Winslet and David Kross. The tortured Ralph Finnes has a couple of wonderful moments as well as Bruno Ganz and Lina Olin in a dual role.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A victim's guilt,"The film is a series of profound moral dilemmaswhile contrived by the author, they are fair questionsthat resonate deeply in the 21st Century: The role of guilt in victims, perpetrators, individuals and collectively, as well as justice, forgiveness, redemption, shame and, of course, literacy and its role in Western thought.All this is a pretty heady mix for a film, but Stephen Daldry (as with ""The Hours"" ) makes literary conceit play very naturally here. David Hare's screenplay and the remarkable cinematography of the always remarkable Roger Deakins together with a sensitive score by Nico Muhly, this is indeed rarefied film-making.But the actors are what drag the audience into this story. David Kross is amazing as the young Michael who has to play a range of virginal innocent to wizened and bitter. It's the key role in the film, and we're all lucky he was found to play this role. And the ever confounding Kate Winslet. What an amazing career for this young actress! Running through a list of her credits, she has some of the best performances of the last decade: ""Holy Smoke,"" ""Eternal Sunshine,"" ""Iris,"" ""Finding Neverland,"" ""Little Children."" But here she does something very different. Playing what amounts to a monster, we see that they too are human. Not many actresses could bring this off, but it may be her greatest accomplishment to date.Ralph Fiennes brings a continuity to the work David Kross begins, and there's a brief appearance by Lena Olin who commands the dignity the role deserves.I'm puzzled at the lukewarm reception to this film. I almost missed seeing it. And it turned out to be one of my favorite and the most heart-rending films of the year. All involved should be very proud.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'd rather re-watch the Reader than re-read The Watcher.,"It's taken me a while to review this...You know, it's rare for me to watch the film (that means ""movie"" in German) and THEN read the book, no disrespect against intended against literature and the films thereof.I was in what British people call ""college"" but was actually high school and I had a free period last thing on Friday. I would try to get all the homework and reading out of the way so I could read something and at one point I read this.The book has kind of skewed my vision of the movie and I suppose I owe it a re-watch to that end.First things, first: elephant in the room: there is exactly one language this movie should be in and ever should have been in and that language beings with a G and rhymes with ""merman"". This cannot be said enough.But it's good though. I was bemused to find out that my dad had watched it and sort of liked it. In any case he called ""disturbing"" and I suppose it is in a way that doesn't really activate until you are going over it in your mind days later and I suspect, love or hate it, it will burrow into you.The novel is sort of a parallel of a young boy's disillusionment with the woman who quote unquote ""made him a man"" with the struggle of the Teutonic people to come to terms with the whole Hitler thing.The wonderful thing about a lichtspiel (that means ""film"" in German) is how it can seem to fill your whole world or at least your evening but is still on the whole a very efficient non-committal medium of narrative so you're getting a much less chunky experience than the book (I forget the German word for that).But it's all there: act one is the ""dear penthouse"" part which in Act 2 develops into an adorable age discrepant romance that in Act 3 suddenly gets pretty grim.I suppose it's ultimately a retrospective on how good things never really last and there's something bad within every good thing (and vice versa).A curiously lyrically but oddly sobering experience.At least it's still in German accents.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A thoughtful and plausible examination of guilt.,"Very well acted and presented and a faithful representation of the main points of the novel on which it is based. This film encourages us to look closely at very difficult issues surrounding the atrocities of World War II. I am at a loss to understand why so many critics have been so damning of it. Perhaps it is too subtle for them to understand. It seeks to outlaw the false and intellectually lazy theory to explain the holocaust, namely that the horrors were committed by monsters. In its place we are offered contextualization, not as excuse but as explanation of how quite ordinary people were able to do extraordinarily dreadful things. We avoid these uncomfortable facts at our peril.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Kind of Film to Admire Rather Than Fall in Love With,"""The Reader"" is full of interesting ideas, but it suffers from lacklustre execution.The central question at the heart of the story is whether or not we'll ever be able to distance ourselves enough from the Holocaust to understand how it was allowed to happen. Categorizing every person who played a role in it as a monster is easy and it provides an emotional catharsis, but it also prevents us from learning from history. After all, not every person who worked in a concentration camp was evil -- many of them were just people doing their jobs without any of the historical context we now have. And if we disregard them as something inhuman, we won't be able to know how to prevent something similar from happening again.This question plays out in the story of Hannah, a former concentration camp guard (played by Kate Winslet), and Michael, played as a young man by David Kross and as an older man by Ralph Fiennes. Hannah and David have an affair before David knows of Hannah's past, and comes across her again years later when he's a law student and she's on trial as a war criminal. David must reconcile his loathing of what Hannah did with the fact that he knows she's not a monster. Hannah's real shame are not her crimes, but rather the fact that she never learned to read, and the film's best moments come in the third act when Michael, as a way of expiating some of the guilt he feels at not coming to Hannah's defense when he knew information that would have helped her case, records himself reading some of Hannah's favorite stories and sends them to her in prison.""The Reader"" is a solid piece of film-making, but it has that ever-so-slightly-embalmed quality that comes when a director and writer feel the need to be too respectful to the source material. It's sombre and tactful and always feels more like a filmed book than a movie. It never comes cinematically alive. It boasts good performances, especially from Winslet and Lena Olin, who has brief dual roles as mother and daughter concentration camp survivors. And it has one all-too-brief thrilling sequence in which Winslet's character decides to spend her time in prison learning to read -- just watch Winslet's face as Hannah recognizes the word ""the"" for the first time. Otherwise, it's the kind of movie to admire rather than fall in love with.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good second half,"The first half of this movie, which focuses on the relationship between a young man (16 or so) and a middle-aged woman, is beautifully shot but pretty empty. It is as if the talent behind something like a Merchant-Ivory film (minus the script writer) had grabbed the first story that came to hand and filmed it just to keep busy. It's beautifully done, but apparently pointless.Then, once the trial starts, the movie gets MUCH more interesting. Kate Winslet gives a truly first-rate performance as a very difficult character whom we only come to understand over time. This second half held me.Yet, after it was over and I discussed it with the person with whom I had seen it, I found weaknesses as well as strengths. Michael, the young man who has an affair with Hanna, is studying law and guilt, but he really never has interesting things to say on Hanna's involvement. His conversations with his professor could have been much more interesting and better written.In the same sense, Hanna's preoccupation with order and fear of chaos, which play so important a role in the second half of the film, could have been developed in the first half. As could have been her shame over her ""deficiency.""Not the great movie some critics seem to be hailing it as, therefore, but still worth a viewing, especially for Winslet's truly impressive performance.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
About As Unbiased and Objective As Any Form Of A Medium Can Get,"The Reader is one of my favorite movies from the year 2008. It is incredibly complex in the way you react to the characters of the movie. It carries many emotions from sensuality to anger all the way back to that of sympathy and resolution. Many moves advertise themselves as unbiased and fair but nothing gets close to that like The Reader which is able to build sympathy for a character you would never think you could feel towards.The acting in the movie was phenomenal. Especially that of Kate Winslet who draws out many emotions from whoever is watching. She plays an ex-Nazi guard who has an affair with a 16 year old boy played very well by David Kross. Her bitter, cold attitude, random behavior as well as her past history seems unjustifiable and deplorable. Yet you can do nothing more than feel empathy and compassion towards the shame and humiliation she feels about her one well kept secret. In the course of her affair she ask for one thing, to be read to. From this do you see the humanity within her. Ralph Fiennes also gave quite a nice performance as an older Michael Berg who looks back on his life and then later finds a way to open himself up through his time of self reflection and sudden realizations towards life. David Kross plays the younger Michael Berg whose performance was undoubtedly a very good one, maintaining his presence in not letting himself being totally overshadowed. Overall the performances are very deep and will keep you thinking long after you have seen the movie.The directing and writing also was very key to the emotions felt in this movie. Every scene had to be done precisely and consistently to feel genuinely touched rather than feeling falsely drawn in. Stephen Daldry did that under his great subtle direction. The writing by David Hare allowed actors such as Ralph Fiennes, David Kross and of course Kate Winslet to give such stunning and deep performances and take the film to another level.I found this movie to be very compelling in many ways. The emotions felt here were not cheap gimmicks but that of feeling true sympathy and forgiveness towards what we would normally describe as something wrong, shameful and reprehensible. I can't remember another film that made me feel these emotions for a character especially after learning one startling secret after another. This film succeeded in ways that almost movie would likely fail in, it did not come off as generous or light but as remarkably fair as a film or any type of medium can get shedding light on both sides of the spectrum. This is a film that is amazingly thought provoking and will bring out the humanity within all of us and should not be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Evil often has a human face,"Directed by Stephen Daldry and written by David Hare, ""The Reader"" is a thought-provoking and surprising drama that takes the viewer in several different directions. Though some reviewers on this site are critical of Daldry and the film, in lesser hands, ""The Reader"" would be a total, erratic mess.The story is told in flashback as the adult Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) remembers his youth. As a 15-year-old boy, the young Michael (David Kross) has his first forays into sex with an older woman, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) in 1958 Berlin. She helps him when he winds up on her doorstep, ill with scarlet fever; he returns to thank her when he's well. The two enter into a sexual relationship. As part of their time together, Hanna has Michael read to her. One day, Hanna simply disappears. The next time Michael sees her is in 1966, when he is a law student in Heidelberg and his class travels to watch a trial. It is then he realizes not one secret that Hanna carried with her, but two.""The Reader"" is, above all, a very human story of real, conflicted human beings, and the brilliant performances reflect this. David Kross is exceptional as the young Michael, in the throes of first, blinding passion, who, in the face of the truth about the woman he loved, endeavors to understand her nonetheless. Kate Winslet is magnificent, and that's the only word for her. Hardened by life and her unsentimental and uncompromising view of the world, she is cut off from people due to a secret she considers shameful. With Michael she allows herself some softness, and gives in to not only passion but emotion, sobbing when Michael reads a sad story to her. Winslet shows us all of this, her need to connect with someone, and her strict view of life. Ralph Fiennes turns in another excellent performance; Michael's world and his own isolation were shaped by Hanna. As an adult, he still grapples with a decision he made and his own guilt; he still tries to understand not only her but how he could love her, and in the midst of all of these complex emotions, he believes he owes her something. He ends up giving her the greatest gift he could - her dignity.As with ""Dead Man Walking,"" there is more to a person than his or her actions, reprehensible though they may be. We are not, after all, what we do but who we are. While some crimes are unforgivable, there is, shockingly, at times a connection with the perpetrator that allows us to see the person and extend a consideration that person never gave another. Thus murderers have loving parents and family, and someone who showed inhumanity to others has a little humanity shown them.A very remarkable story.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sympathy for the devil,"The Reader is a film which for the first half of its running time goes to great pains to make sure the viewer sympathizes with the character of Hanna Schmitz. Nevermind the fact that Hanna, a woman in her mid-30s living a quiet life as a tram conductor in Germany in 1958, is carrying on an obviously inappropriate love affair with a 15-year old boy. And in actuality there is not much love at all in this supposed love affair, this is pretty much all about sex. Well, sex and reading as Hanna makes her young lover, Michael Berg, read to her before they get down to business. The reading angle is curious to say the least but that will make sense in time. Anyhow we watch as Hanna seduces the young, innocent Michael. And watch and watch and watch again as this movie certainly doesn't skimp on the sex scenes. And despite the nagging sense that this relationship is obviously wrong the film makes no bones about the fact that we're supposed to feel empathy with Hanna, to be on her side. And then just like that Hanna disappears. Eight years later we see her again. But now Hanna Schmitz is on trial. And we learn her dark secret. Hanna Schmitz was a death camp guard, responsible for the deaths of countless innocents. Are we still meant to have empathy for this woman? It's a lot harder now that's for sure. If we pity her maybe it is because of her other secret, the one she keeps hidden as she finds it to be even more shameful than her death camp atrocities. Sorting out our feelings for the complex character of Hanna Schmitz will not be easy. And we're just watching the story, Michael Berg is living it. His coming to grips with the truths with which he is confronted is what it seems this movie is ultimately all about.This is a movie which asks a lot of questions to which it appears there are no comfortable answers. Most centrally, once we learn the truth about Hanna's horrible past should we not be repulsed by this character? She is pure evil, isn't she? Or was she just, as she rather coldly explains it, doing her job? After spending so much time embracing Hanna is it so easy, for us and for Michael, to all of a sudden perceive her to be some sort of devilish monster? There is no doubt that the story this movie has to tell is a unique and thought-provoking one. And with Kate Winslet playing Hanna you know you can count on a thoroughly professional and powerful performance in the key role. Perhaps even more impressive than Winslet is David Kross in his portrayal of young Michael. We expect Winslet to be brilliant, we also expect that she may thoroughly overpower and overshadow her young counterpart. Many young actors, matched against one of the leading actresses of our time, would have been completely in over their head in this thoroughly challenging role. But Kross holds his own. Ralph Fiennes bookends the film with his portrayal of the older, adult Michael and it almost seems as if he is in an entirely different movie than everybody else. He's there at the beginning, he's there at the end and he has a moment or two sprinkled in the middle but wherever he is there's a sense that in his scenes things are somehow a bit off. No fault of his performance which is fine for what he is given to do. But this movie belongs to Winslet and Kross. As the story plays out these two performers create characters you can't help but feel for. Even if in Hanna's case you ultimately find yourself questioning what exactly it is you should be feeling. And truth be told Michael will not be found to be faultless either. Maybe he doesn't always do the right thing. Sometimes though it is not crystal clear exactly what the right thing is.There is no denying that this is a powerful film. And Winslet and Kross are certainly excellent in it. Perhaps it doesn't all come together as well as you might hope. The flashback structure doesn't always work perfectly. The pace does drag at times. And when the movie finally comes to its end there's a bit of a sense of anticlimax. It's as if the movie has reached its natural ending point but there's still another scene to be tacked on, a scene which makes sense for the story but by that point all the drama has really played itself out. But for whatever flaws there may be along the way there is no doubt that the story this movie tells is a fascinating and powerful one. And that story makes the movie well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Warning: This Review Contains Full Frontal Nudity,"Warning: this review contains full frontal nudity. But that's okay, because you really can't get a grip on the Holocaust until you've had a gynecologist's eye view of Kate Winslet's naked *&^%s.""The Reader"" is pretentious cheese. It isn't honest enough to be straightforward soft-core coming-of-age porn, or to be a hard-hitting, revelatory Holocaust movie. Rather, it's a clunky and silly film that attempts to graft the one onto the other and succeeds at neither. ""The Reader"" brings the viewer in, and then teases him, with a half hour of almost uninterrupted simulated bodily functions, combined with nude bathing. It's all a great big, high school literature class metaphor about the washing off of guilt, dontcha know. Then ""The Reader"" devotes its remaining hours to scenes of well-dressed, attractive young Germans sitting around asking and declaring, ""Who's guilty? Aren't all our parents guilty? I hate my parents."" Overlaying every boring, banal, scene and vapid line of dialogue with ponderous, self-important gas, ""The Reader"" ultimately succeeds at neither serious discussion nor eroticism.From top to bottom, the cast is first rate. David Kross is achingly poignant as teenager Michael Berg, who, in the 1950s, loses his virginity in an affair with Hanna Schmitz, a 36-year-old, former SS concentration camp guard. Kross is both intimately human and vulnerable and also larger than life and every bit the compelling, big screen movie star. In that he reminds the viewer of the young Peter O'Toole. May Kross have a long and bountiful career.In the ""deleted scenes"" reel on the DVD, there are three fine scenes that could have served as centers of three fine movies. In the most gripping, Thomas Thieme is a truck driver who gives Kross a ride on a backwoods road where a large horse is transporting logs. Thieme is repulsive, terrifying, and also clearly human and in need of understanding. In another deleted scene, in a conversation with his professor (the always brilliant Bruno Ganz) an attractive German boy admits that his father was an SS guard. In a third deleted scene, a prisoner painstakingly learns to read in a prison cell. That these three fabulous scenes were deleted, while endless scenes of nude bathing were kept, informs you of the filmmakers' eye on the box office.In the DVD commentary, the film's director Stephen Daldry, CBE (Commander of the British Empire), script writer David Hare, and novelist Bernhard Schlink smugly pat themselves on the back. Wearing professorial clothing, tweeds and nubbly sweaters, these graying white men express how mah-velous, perfectly mah-velous it is that they've made such a big, fat, profound film that will finally get people to engage in some serious thought about the Holocaust. Significantly, they never mention a single other of the, by now, millions of works of art that got to the topic before they did, nor do they ever address their pimping out Kate Winslet's &^%*s to make their contribution to the body of Holocaust lit stand out.Check out the IMDb discussion board for ""The Reader."" Most threads are devoted to such deep and heavy topics as clinically detailed examinations of the tautness and firmness, pendulousness or sag of Kate Winslet's #*&^'s, the straightness or curvature and length of David Kross' %$#^*, the specific acts that the characters engage in, and what bodily orifices are employed.This review is not a protest against erotica; it's a protest against BS. This review isn't even a protest against the disturbingly burgeoning subgenre of Holocaust porn. In fact there is a brilliant, scathing, unforgettable scene in ""Schindler's List"" where Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) menaces his Jewish slave, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) as she bathes in a cramped basement. That scene is so powerful and unforgettable because it has two things ""The Reader"" completely lacks: psychological insight – the viewer knows exactly who Goeth and Hirsch are and what their relationship is to each other, and, thus, complexity and depth, and stylistic sophistication – Goeth does all the talking. He imagines Helen's replies.Look, there is worthy art out there about the Holocaust. Read Elie Wiesel's ""Night,"" Borowski's ""This Way to the Gas;"" Rufeisen's ""In the Lion's Den,"" see ""Schindler's List,"" ""Europa Europa,"" ""The Gray Zone,"" ""Shoah,"" or ""The Shop on Main Street."" There's also really good soft-core porn out there, much of it free on the internet. ""The Reader"" gains nothing, and says nothing, in its pretentious, but commercially shrewd, attempt to combine the two genres.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Great Read,"We don't know. We think we do but we don't. We make decisions or sometimes decisions are made for us but we think we've made them. Then suddenly, there we are. We can't be certain how we got there or where we will be when everything settles but we do know that we are alive. Some experiences are life altering and we can run from them or embrace them. Staying to see them through though can bring incredible bliss but also tormented turmoil. We just never know. One such experience was had by a young Michael Berg (David Kross) and is chronicled in Stephen Daldry's THE READER. How could he know that when he pulled into an alley to be sick that he would meet the woman who would shape his entire life? How could he know that getting close to her would pull him the furthest he's ever been from himself?Of course, when you're a sixteen-year-old boy and a woman who looks like Kate Winslet disrobes in front of you in the privacy of her bathroom, how much thought really goes into the decision that has presented itself? However little it is, it is certainly less than is warranted. This is especially true in West Germany of 1958. This is a Germany that is uncertain how to proceed, how to be its new self in the eyes of the world and the eyes of its very own future generations. Winslet plays Hanna Schmitz, a compassionate woman but also abrasive and stern. Winslet strikes the perfect balance between directness and desire in Schmitz, making her complexities part of her appeal. She is a good fifteen years older than the young Berg and she knows much better than he of her country's history. What he knows, he has read in books, been taught in school. What she knows, she lived first hand. So when the two come together, naked in each other's arms, the meeting is as redemptive as it is passionate. Berg is just happy to be in love and having sex but Schmitz is washing herself clean with the youthful vigor of Germany's tomorrow.The summer ends and so does the affair, as one would expect. Just when it would seem that the two would never meet again, life steps in to ensure that past decisions, perhaps made in haste, can come to see their consequences. Berg has grown some and is a college man, studying to be a lawyer, when he catches sight of Hanna Schmitz again. Their latest chance encounter is far less exciting though as he sees her on a class outing to a courthouse. Schmitz is on trial for crimes against humanity for her time as an officer in the Nazi party during the Second World War. Berg's memory of his first love would now become a question of his own morality. How could he love someone who was now accused of such atrocities? How could he be so intimate with someone he apparently never truly knew? And yet, now that he knows her past, does he really know how her past came to be? After all, what is the face of evil? Is it Hanna Schmitz or is it something incredibly bigger than her?Ralph Fiennes is the future of Germany. He plays Berg as an adult. His life is orderly, very clean, crisp and cold. He made decisions that made him the man he is and he can never say whether they were the right ones or not. What he can see is that we all make decisions that either hurt or harm other people and that the atrocities committed by his past generations are not as far outside the realm of understanding as he might have originally thought. More importantly, redemption is not that far either.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant,"Reader, The (2008)**** (out of 4)In post-war Germany a 15-year-old boy (David Kross) has an affair with an older woman (Kate Winslet) and falls in love but weeks later she disappears without a trace. Years later the man is in law school when he goes to a war-crime trial and sees that the woman has been brought up on charges. What follows will effect his life through adulthood. A few weeks back I said Slumdog Millionaire was my pick for the best movie of 2008 but that has now changed as this film will take the top spot. I expected a great movie walking into this thing but I never imagined how beautiful and touching a movie experience it would turn out to be. The film deals with a lot of ugly situations and has some downright heartbreaking moments but I love movies with great stories being brought to life with great acting. Hopefully the Oscars will treat this film very kindly because it's certainly in a league of its own. The film's basic story has the adult (played by Ralph Fiennes) looking back at his first sexual relationship and the effects it had on his life and especially his estranged relationship with his own daughter. I think a lot of what happens to a young boy will have a major impact on his life and I think that's the greatest thing about this film. What happens to be boy starting with the affair and leading up to the trials make for some very compelling drama. I'd say this is a brilliant coming of age story but I'm not sure if that would be insulting the film since there's so much more to it. The film also does a great job with its rather frank sex and nudity scenes. There's quite a bit of both but the film is very mature about it considering the age of the two people involved. The subject of the age is never mentioned as the film just treats it as one thing that happens among many others. Both Kross and Winslet were very brave in terms of their sexuality but their brilliant performances are the key here. I expected a great performance by Winslet since she's perhaps the greatest actress working today but Kross stands right there with her through the entire film. I think Kross' performance is the real key here as we're seeing all this stuff from his point a view and it's up to him to sell the story and the emotions behind it. The actor handles the awakening of his sexuality brilliantly and he's even better during the trial time scenes where his judgement is going to have a major impact on several people. Fiennes is brilliant as well in his supporting role playing the adult . He has couple emotional scenes, which I won't ruin but his acting inside the jail cell might be the greatest I've seen from him. This is a pretty depressing film from start to finish but that's often the case when you deal with a subject matter like this one. Director Daldry does a masterful job handling the different time periods and putting them all together. The story jumps around from decade to decade but all of this is handled with a problem. In many ways this is a love story and on that level I think the film hits a grand slam and turns out to be a true masterpiece without a single flaw.",,Anonymous,Romance
What Did We Learn?,"Stephen Daldry knows how to tell a story, knows how important it is to  make each of those characters relevant and indispensable, more  importantly, emotions are finely portrayed, but it is the cerebral  quality of his work that both impresses and irritates the audience.  Somehow, he let go of his control and made ""Billy Elliot"" exuberant and  glorious, with each note and emotion spilling out of the screen. His  restraint might have lessened the impact of the dark nature of the  tragedy in ""The Hours""; somehow the balance continues in ""The Reader"",  a powerful testament to the complexity of humans and their  interactions. In ""The Reader"" learning occurs, consequences, origins,  and motivations are carefully explored and analyzed, leaving out some  of the mystery for us to decide. Choice is key here, and some choices  are carry a bigger weight than others.  The marvelous Kate Winslet, who should be honoured for the quality of  her work, with as much recognition as it is humanly possible portrays  the central character of the story, a woman whose life might have been  shaped by unfortunate events, mostly undisclosed to us, and some of her  own genetic makeup. We, as the lawyers and the students in the film,  get to evaluate the evidence and choose to make a statement to justify  hers and our own ethical standpoints. It is the intricate and deft  interpretation of Hannah that anchors the story. Although, the story  follows Michael and their relationship from his teenage years to the  devastating conclusion, the film succeeds because Winslet is able to  show every bit of the confusion, rationale, and emotion that her  character possesses. She seems cold and detached, but as we look, we  discover that there is more to her than we can see from the moments we  see her on the screen. Hannah carries secrets inside her soul, somehow  keeping herself alive, surviving, living an austere existence that  hypnotizes, seduces, and repulses those she encounters.  Michael is seduced by this mysterious woman, and his own future is  shaped by those moments they spend together. What he doesn't realize is  how big of an effect their time together will have on his life. Their  early scenes are powerful and presented with a strong sense of realism  and brevity. They're probable the best of the film and might have to be  reviewed to understand how key they are to the further growth of  Michael's life and reactions to others. Winslet does not say much, but  her manipulations provoke her desired effects.  As their paths diverge and meet, their relationship changes as one  observes the dramatic turn of events that brings them together again,  and how Michael's actions have dire consequences for both of them. It  is during this period that we think we begin to see how relative  everything: what is moral and immoral, logic and emotional, simple and  complex. Highs and lows are hit again, as we become more involved in  one of the most powerful and dramatic moments of their lives.  In the final act of the film is when Winslet and Feines do some of  their most outstanding work ever; she even surpassing her masterful  turns in ""Revolutionary Road"", and ""Eternal Sunshine"". Every gesture,  every look, every enunciation add details and shed light to who they  were, are and might become. It is subtle work, haunting, and  bewitching, the work very few people are able to do.  ""The Reader"" reaches its amazing conclusion with a couple of scenes  that might break whatever little strength we might still have left.  ""The Reader"" isn't an important work, but it is a work that should be  recognized by the quality of its work, a finely tuned and produced  piece of cinema by people who recognize how magical, powerful, and  intelligent films can be.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
More romantically engaging than politically or morally provocative.,"I've read several places on the internet that many found 'The Reader' to be slow-paced and relatively boring at times. I didn't find it boring for a single second, it's a very interesting film about the Holocaust aftermath in Germany. Surely the film would have had extra affection if the characters had spoken in the German language, but the performances are all around so good that I quickly forgave them for making Bruno Ganz speaking English. Anyhow, Stephen Daldry does have problems keeping a film spanning from the mid 50ties to the mid 90ties well constructed all the way through, there are a couple of missteps (as what's actually the thing between Michael (David Kross/Ralph Fiennes) and his family?) but in retrospect it's Kate Winslet's fine performance and the odd romantic situation that lingers. Great work from cinematography and production design captures the time-traveling with great visuals.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Incredebly Balanced,"This is an amazingly believable film. The types of dilemmas faced by the characters are the kinds of things that easily could have happened. There's pride and anger and self doubt. This is really a story about a man who has been shaken loose from innocence, who must face the fact that someone he loved or thought he loved could have been a monster. Still, even if she was a monster, we cannot totally condemn her. Kate Winslet is incredible from the sexually driven streetcar conductor to the perpetrator of an event that killed hundreds of Jews. The amazing thing is that she can't get her mind around what she has done. She saw it as a way to find work since everyone was at war and she needed the employment. She is painfully honest which is hard to fathom for the courts. Roy Fiennes has a connection to her because of their affair, but he is still repulsed by the events. Because of his basic human kindness he continues to read to her as he did by recording books on audio tapes (he comes to realize that she can't read or write). There are not simple answers and no last minute discovery; it's about people trying to connect. This is a fine film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why didn't you speak up?,"""Every single day -- 365 days a year -- an attack against children occurs that is 10 times greater than the death toll from the World Trade Center...We know how to prevent these deaths -- we have the biological knowledge and tools to stop this public health travesty, but we're not yet doing it."" Jean-Pierre Habicht, professor of epidemiology and nutritional sciences at Cornell.Eight million of the eleven million childhood deaths a year could easily be prevented. That's because almost 60 percent of deaths of children under 5 in the developing world are due to malnutrition and its interactive effects on preventable diseases. Is this not a holocaust?An old Soviet piece of gossip had it that Comrade Khruschev was interrupted during his famous 'secret' speech before the Communist Party elite when he denounced Stalin's crimes in 1956, three years after Stalin's death. A voice from the audience shouted, ""Why didn't you speak out against these crimes when Comrade Stalin was committing them?"" Khruschev looked up from his speech and asked loudly, ""Who said that?"" A long silence ensued after which Khruschev observed, ""That is why.""When you see ""The Reader"", ask yourself why you are doing nothing about the holocaust which is happening every year to the poorest children of the world. Is it because you are afraid to be seen as being 'silly' or too 'socialist' or 'soft hearted' or because the system demands that you pay attention to the important things of life like obeying your bosses and keeping order and besides, ""What can a lowly person like myself do about the situation"" and you're too busy speculating on what the real estate market will be doing in the coming months and finding a pair of jeans at Jeans West which will fit.....Michael meets Hanna when he is fifteen. Unbeknownst to Michael, he is coming down with scarlet fever. He is throwing up in an alley on a very rainy day when Hanna, the tram conductor, stops to offer him a warm place to rest until he feels better. Hanna also cleans up his vomit from the pavement. Hanna believes in orderliness and cleanliness. This penchant for order is apparent from the beginning of their relationship and these traits lead her to offer Michael baths and to bathe herself as well and as the movie progresses the motherly Hanna and her son-like friend begin to explore the attractions which flow from such erotic circumstances.Both Hanna and Michael are full of hidden passions. Michael could have been a Heydrich in Prague, had he been born 15 years earlier. He is clearly 'officer material'. Hanna, on the other hand, is a working class woman born 30 years earlier into a society which would tell women that their highest aspirations could be fulfilled by staying in the kitchen with the children when they weren't engaged in taking in a church service. with the family. Education was unnecessary. Both Hanna and Michael are intelligent and attractive. Both are turned on by the doors which are opened to them by great literature. Both are also social products of their own German culture, with its various and sundry facets of puritanical, psychological repression, including a kind of reserve which leads to the peculiarly German goodness of keeping one's mouth shut in public about things political, things which the authorities have well in hand. Hanna's fear of exposing her own illiteracy and Michael's fear of public condemnation as a young law student at speaking up for Hanna in a court of law are the stuff of tragedy.Sound familiar?Even after many steamy sexual encounters, Hanna is shocked by passages in D.H. Lawrence's LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER, telling Michael that it is the equivalent of smut and that he should stop reading from it, almost as his mother would have. But clearly, Michael is not attracted to Hanna because she is a mother replica--Oedipus, no. One has only to compare and contrast Michael's screen mother with Kate Winslett's Hanna to know that.However, it is 'klip und klar' that Hanna loves Michael and he loves her but, unbeknownst to them both when they are together, their love runs very, very deeply. They might believe that they will get over their summertime romance as time goes by, but the reality is that such love does not die, no matter what happens: there are no conditions for it.There are elements of Fassbinder's ""Ali, Fear Eats the Heart"" and ""Berlin Alexanderplatz"" in ""The Reader"". ""Sophie's Choice"" also comes to mind. See this movie and be prepared to cry for humanity because as Thoreau observed, """"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them."" Methnks this is especially so in cultures as deeply built on the authoritarian personality character structure as the German one is.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'll ask the crucial question: Would this movie still be approved if it was between opposite genders?,"Cinematographically beautiful yet story wise unsettling. This kind of movies help me to generalize some stuff in life, such as I acknowledge that majority of the audience that liked this and helped this movie have these ratings are scary, nuts and probably sick in the head.I'd understand if this was based on true events yet even then I wouldn't be the biggest fan. Knowing this was just written for a movie bugs me so much.So I am asking, what if this was between a 40ish years old man and 15 years old girl?And I am wondering..Why seeing a naked boy that's just 15 yo amused many people?How did people connect with this storyline and what intrigued them?I have many questions and I am scared of the answers.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Kate Winslet is a wonderful actor.  She can't carry an entire film.,"The Reader (2008), directed by Stephen Daldry, is a coming-of-age movie that begins in postwar Germany. The film stars Kate Winslet, who is one of the great actors of our time. She turns in another excellent performance in a difficult role. Ralph Fiennes does his usual workmanlike job, and Bruno Ganz and Lena Olin appear in supporting roles. Olin has a great scene near the end of the movie; Ganz appears to be walking through the film without really noticing where he is.The film deals with the question of German guilt, and also with the complex relationship between the characters played by Winslet and Fiennes. (There's also a subplot about Fiennes and his daughter, but that never goes anywhere.)Given all the fine actors, and the plot potential of this movie, I was expecting a truly memorable film experience. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The film plods along, with a fair amount of histrionics, but not much else, until it gradually winds down and fades out as the credits start to roll.Winslet is talented and beautiful and Fiennes is talented and handsome. I'd like to see them together in a film that doesn't hinge on a ""mystery"" that's not all that mysterious.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Reader,"Kate Winslett's performance as Hanna makes this film a memorable experience. Her vacant stares are anything but vacant and will haunt you long after you have left the theater. The subject matter is much more than just an affair with an older woman, albeit this love affair impacts the young man throughout his life. It is more a morality play and a philosophical question of German guilt.Bruno Ganz, who plays the professor, actually includes Karl Jaspers' The Question of German Guilt as required reading for his young law students, including Michael Berg, Hanna's lover. The professor also requires his young law students to attend a trial for low level guards from the concentration camps.While watching the trial scenes, I tried to make a decision as to what I would have done if I were in Berg's position. It is not an easy question. I guarantee you will be torn apart by this film.The young Michael Berg, David Kross, gives a stunning performance. And Ralph Fiennes, as usual, gives the performance he should, reserved, yet multi-layered if you look deep into the philosophical questions this film poses.It is based on a book by Bernhard Schlick, adapted for the screen by David Hare, and directed by Stephen Daltry. I highly recommend this film.One last thing, on a personal note, I fell in love with Bruno Ganz in the Wim Wenders film Wings of Desire and I am still in love with that man.

Learning from history,"In the anti Apartheid film, A Dry White Season the lawyer character played by Marlon Brando stated that Law and Justice are not the same thing, at best they are distant cousins and in South Africa they are not even on talking terms.In a similar vein in The Reader, Professor Rohl (Bruno Ganz) the law professor argues: 'Societies think they operate by something called morality, but they don't. They operate by something called law.'He goes on to say: '8000 people worked at Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been convicted, and only 6 of murder.'The Reader is an infuriating film although I admire its subtlety and in some ways daring. Although the narrative is jumbled up, it consists of a love affair of Michael Berg (David Kross)a 15 year old schoolboy and a tram conductress Hanna (Kate Winslet) who is over twice his age. It is a passionate affair mainly due to his raging teenage hormones and during their time together he reads books to her.Hanna then suddenly disappears and the story moves eight years later when Michael is a law student attending trials of Nazis with other students and their lecturer Professor Rohl. To his horror he finds Hanna is one of the defendants as she was a guard at Auschwitz and is accused of allowing several hundred prisoners to burn to death locked inside a church.This incidents sullies his memories of Hanna and racks him with guilt. Unable to talk to anyone about this he finds that he has information that could help her and lower her sentence. Micheal realises that the reason Hanna liked him to read to her was because she was illiterate and the accusations she is facing was the she allegedly gave written orders leading to people's death. This cannot be true but Hanna is embarrassed to let people know she cannot read or write.The final section consists of an older Michael (Ralph Fiennes) who we see in some scenes now a wealthy, successful lawyer, divorced but with a child still affected by her relationship with Hanna. Over time he has sent her tapes in which he narrates stories to her and eventually just before she is about to be released from prison he goes to see Hanna who is now an old woman.Eventually Michael goes to New York to see one of the survivors from Auschwitz who a small child at the time. It is an uncomfortable experience for him as he confesses his love affair with Hanna to her. The first time he has ever spoke about it.I somehow felt that the film always did not get its theme across clearly despite its symbolism and imagery. I liked parts of the film but it did not lead to a coherent whole.Hanna asks the Judge at the trial what would you have done?' Of course no answer is forthcoming. In the same vein young Micheal allows Hanna to be wrongly convicted. He is angry, ashamed, bitter or just clueless. Yet someone gave those written orders and he let Hanna carry the blame and let the real culprit get away with a lesser charge.I did think Hanna's lawyer was useless, I have little idea of the German legal system but he let her basically walk into jail and throw the key away. Surely he would had known that Hanna was not exactly that bright and she could not read or write. Did she never sign anything? Maybe one of Michael's fellow students was right, the trial was a sham, deflecting guilt from the many to a few.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent one of the best,"The most heart rendering, touching, disturbing and yet immensely beautiful movie of the year. I can not remember when last time I was so much moved by a film. Only another movie coming in mind called Monster's Balls. I don't know why I am comparing these two movies, apparently nothing similar but perhaps somewhere vast intrigues of human mind and its dilemmas, the complexity and overall hands of destiny bring the character of Halle Berry with Kate Winslet and Billy Bob Thornton with Ralph Fiennes.The human pride has collapsed dynasties in histories. The Reader takes you to a journey of what human pride and fear of being ashamed can bring down on us, perhaps life long imprisonment to someone just to keep the secret; to someone else it perhaps brings rotting in the agony of repent and living a life worse than death.This movie poses many glitches of relationships. Accepting love as of any situation is the key, listening to heart and be bold in love is another. Why did young Michael could not meet Kate during trial? Why didn't he save her? Was it his own fear of exposing an apparently socially unaccepted affair or was it the respect towards his once lover's secret what he bore although his later life. Can someone just be convicted of guilt even the then law and order compelled her to do the job? When Hannah asked the judge ""what would you have done if your were in my place?"" not only makes him and the juries to silence but also brings the question before us, what would we have done if we were born during Nazi regime and sent to camps as guards? Could there be a choice? What will be her alternative? So many questions...I was dumbfounded with numerous questions of our social structures and be-wilderness of human natures. And overall sometimes people think they can find their ways in lives but never tries to understand what their hearts want. Is it his weak nature or is it moral dilemma to protect somebody who is convicted of felony? But then who is responsibleI am sure when you watch this movie you will face similar questions. If Kate Winslet doesn't win Oscar for this role then it will be injustice to this beautiful actress who portrays her character with so much subtleties and nuances that I have seen rare in recent past. Same applies to the character of young Michael by David Kross and nonparallel Ralph Fiennes as the elder one. The expressions of this English Patient actor are marvelous. But it is no doubt a Kate Winslet movie all in all. A wonderful creation by Stephen Daldry and exceptional cinematography.I thought Slumdog was the movie of the year but then that was a loud movie. The re-fineness of the Reader is very exceptional, sets it miles apart from other movies. It is in that genre of movies that tell complexities of love and its non-confluent ends, or you keep on thinking was it not supposed to be like this. Would it be made more beautiful when at the last scene Ralph Fiennes finally opens up his closed heart to her daughter? I don't think so.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Thought-provoking, but not as philosophically penetrating as it needs to be","Can you recall being read stories as a child? Warm and tucked up. In your bed. Feeling safe, secure, loved. And that wonderful, strong, all-knowing adult giving you undivided attention? You don't have to do anything. Wonderful tales race before your eyes. Lose yourself in the prince as he slays the dragon. Or the princess awoken with a kiss. When we awake as adults, we maybe re-create that security for ourselves. We read to get to sleep. We read to our own children. We enjoy worlds and emotions that give us respite from the hard business of living. Why not? I wondered if Hanna (Kate Winslet) had ever been read to as a child. A hard life shows on her face. She lives in a tiny apartment in Berlin. She gets by. But, more importantly, Hanna cannot rebuild her world through a half hour escape in a novel. Hanna cannot read.The Reader brings together familiar enough story lines  the seduction of a young boy by an older woman  the trial of a former SS guard  guilt  self-sacrifice  love found, then lost. But the emotional punch is delivered by mismatching our sympathies to the characters. The people we love turn out to be deeply flawed. But if we hold that against them, are we doing so to make ourselves feel better?Hanna has sex with young Michael, shortly before his sixteenth birthday. We are encouraged to just accept it. Any analysing over whether it was 'wrong' or screwed Michael up emotionally can be done by those diehards in the cafe after the film. More pertinent at the time is their genuine affection, the superb acting, and the imaginative love-making between an extremely buff Michael and a rather fit-looking Kate Winslet. Winslet/Hanna is the constant transformation throughout our film. She is harsh, convincingly Germanic, and ages convincingly from her thirties to her seventies. It's a make-up job that almost rivals Kidman's Virginia Woolf in director Stephen Daldry's earlier masterpiece, The Hours.Hanna is brutally honest with herself about almost everything. Except one thing. She is deeply ashamed of being illiterate. She hides it from Michael, who nevertheless senses it. He makes a habit of reading to her. Everything from Homer's Odyssey and Tolstoy to comic books and back again to Chekhov. We realise how important it is to her: she announces to him that he will read to her before making love, not afterwards.Michael continues schooling to become a lawyer. Hanna is offered a promotion from her bus conductor job  to work in an office. This is a disaster  as she can't read. She throws a hissy fit at puzzled Michael and breaks up their affair. Later, when we learn she had once accepted work as an SS guard instead of a step up in her old job, we can secretly suspect the same reason.Although Hanna is guilty of terrible crimes in the past, our sympathies are not so much with her victims. The one survivor has written a damning book and patently done rather well for herself. Elegant and tall in contrast to the haggard and drawn guards on trial. Those indicted are a handful out of tens of thousands. Symbolic sacrifices. Their incarceration allowing the silent others to feel sanctified. Germany righteously punishes its own. Jews are avenged. Justice is seen to be done. But we see Hanna's co-accused gang up on her. She confesses to something she could not have committed. A personal surrender, an over-redemption.Michael doesn't announce a truth that would mitigate her sentence. He is too ashamed to be connected to her. He disguises it as 'respecting her wishes.' Like Odysseus secretly observing Penelope, he stays incognito. Michael's 'respectable shame' becomes the shame of humanity, unable to forgive, whatever the cost.Ralph Fiennes, as the older Michael, is well-cast. Although the opening scene of The Reader recalls Constant Gardener (white collar chap with nude woman wandering around apartment), Michael is more of a throwback to the slimy characters that Fiennes specialises in.At this point I differed from my viewing companion on the film. She declared it one of the saddest films she had ever seen. While I could not get it out of my mind what a slimeball Michael was. We both agreed it was fundamentally a love story. But for me it was marred by an increasing sense of cynicism. Catharsis for whom? As the emotional valence ratchets up scene by scene, I feel sucked into a sick psychopathology of characters whose stunted development was hardly a matter for theatrical wallowing. And while Winslet ages forty years in the course of the movie, Michael simply has two ages played by two actors. At one point  amid the dizzying flashbacks and forwards  I had to believe Fiennes was twenty years younger as he was wearing a jumper instead of a tie.David Hare has done an admirable job with the screenplay. But the philosophical questioning of attitudes to people who helped the Nazis is hard to portray with cinema's broad brush. In The Hours, Hare (and Daldry) had both the genius of Virginia Woolf's ideas and Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer-winning modern take to work from. With The Reader, Bernhard Schlink's semi-autobiographical novel has generated a film that is thought-provoking rather than yielding insight. Hanna's illiteracy is his metaphor for modern understanding of the Holocaust. We weren't there. We can't understand. ""What would you do?"" Hanna asks the judge, not rhetorically, but wanting an answer.And what would you do, if you couldn't live with what you've done? Even if you felt you'd had no choice? And if even the healing fantasy world of fiction is finally denied you? The Reader is a story that puts nothing to bed.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Reader is a perfectly constructed drama that feels extremely understated.,"This is an interesting one. Often regarded as an ""Oscar-bait"" film due to its subject matter and focus on acting. I never believe this term to be a detriment, in fact it evidently shows here because I thoroughly enjoyed this. A young boy has an affair with an older woman during one summer, she disappears after a promotion which is soon revealed to be a guard at a concentration camp. I shan't say too much in regards to the story, but this is very much what I call a ""story film"". We have a beginning, middle and end which are suitably implemented into a straightforward accessible narrative. Evoking themes of love, truth and reconciliation, I found this to be an endearing and sentimental story without the need of overacting and melodrama. I find that Kate Winslet often overacts, to a point where I dislike her. However, here she gives undoubtedly her best performance. Why? Because it's nuanced. No massive outbursts, no overly animated scenes. It's just her talking and taking control of every scene. Her subtlety and fragility is what captivated me. The character she portrays is shrouded in mystery and is psychologically intriguing, particularly as it is revealed she is unable to do a certain thing which all of us take for granted (I shan't say). Whereas David Kross and Ralph Fiennes' character, both may I just say were extremely competent, brings the heart and soul of the story. Love is a powerful emotion, one that cannot be fabricated or falsified. Ultimately, I believed in the relationship between these characters despite the events that take place. Loved the musical score as well, suited the film brilliantly. I did find the ending was slightly underwhelming, I would've liked it to be more impactful. Certain scenes did drag on however the pacing overall was fine. There is a lot of nudity, no idea why but the two main characters are always naked. Literally. The Reader might be too safe in its subject, but you cannot deny it's still a captivating watch and adequately moody.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love and revulsion are simultaneous emotions,"This movie begins as if it is solely a romantic tale of somewhat forbidden love, but it is much more than that. Kate Winslet stars as Hanna Schmitz, a conductor on the city tram lines. David Kross is the teenaged Michael Berg and the original location in Berlin, Germany in 1958. Michael becomes sick while walking the streets and vomits at the entrance to an apartment building. Hanna takes pity on him, cleans him up and helps him go home.
Michael is diagnosed with scarlet fever, a very dangerous illness at the time and it takes months for him to recover. Once he is well, he revisits Hanna's apartment with flowers in hand. One thing leads to another and they become lovers, older woman and teenage boy. The affair continues and quickly includes Michael reading to Hanna on a regular basis. He learns that Hanna is illiterate, unable to read or write even the simplest words. There are then flash forwards to an adult Michael where he recollects events in his past and tries to cope with his present. These flash forwards continue for some time.
Young Michael enters law school and in an advanced seminar they attend the trial of some female Nazi prison camp guards. Hanna is one of the defendants, which strains Michael psychologically. Hanna is found guilty and given a life sentence. Michael is torn, because he knows that Hanna is illiterate and could not have done some of what she was accused of.
When Hanna is in prison, Michael sends her a tape recorder and cassettes containing books he has put on tapes. Hanna treasures the material and it motivates her to learn to read and write. There is a dramatic conclusion to their relationship and an anticlimax. It is clear from the way it is played that Hanna is the love of Michael's life, yet he cannot get past her sordid past. He struggles with his complex feelings for her, from love to revulsion at what she once was.
This is a movie about love between a teen boy and adult woman that lasts, but in a very complex form. It is a reminder that in dark times, people do dark things, sometimes because they are forced to and other times because they consider it their duty. Michael struggles to make sense of his feelings, what Hanna did and at the end he does the right thing, but not to the results he envisioned.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Reader is performance driven movie,"Last week I saw Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.. Steven Daldry has this quality of telling the story from quite a number of angles.. But the story loses its pace somewhere in between.. The reader is a movie that tells the story of Hanna Schmitz(Kate Winslet) and Michael Berg over a long period.. The movie starts off showing Michael preparing breakfast and it goes backwards where Michael met Hanna for the first time.. Hanna took him home where he was detected with fever.. He came back to Hanna when he recovered where the affair begins and the affair goes on and on and on... In between the affair Hanna expresses her likings to read books but she likes being read to rather that reading herself.. Michael reads her ""The Odyssey,"" ""Huck Finn"" and ""The Lady with the Little Dog."" Despite the bond they shared Hanna disappears from Michael's life one day.. The story moves to the point when Michael is seen in law classes. The professor takes Michael to live court sessions where he sees Hanna is being trial-ed for murdering 300 lives during Nazi war crimes.. There Michael discovers the reason of Hanna not reading books herself.. Because she is illiterate.. He sees Hanna admits all the murders in order to keep the secret that she does not know how to write.. Hanna is imprisoned for life and Michael becomes a lawyer with a unsuccessful marriage and a daughter.. While in prison Michael sends Hanna recorded tapes of all the novels that helps Hanna to past time.. She used the tapes to learn reading and writing that helped her to write letters to Michael.. However Michael does not reply to her.. At the time when Hanna was to be released from prison Michael was her only contact.. Then we see the first confront of Michael and Hanna after the date Hanna disappears.. Michael told Hanna that he has got an apartment for her and a job that upsets Hanna because she expected that Michael would keep her with him... She did not see the Michael that she wanted to see which killed all her intentions to live and that made her commit suicide leaving a will for Michael.. She instructed Michael to give her money to the girl that survived the Nazi fire.. Michael does as she says.. The last scene shows Michael taking her daughter to the grave of Hanna and telling her the story of theirs...A movie showing Nazi war crimes, illiteracy, a secret and intense love making needs a better treatment.. the relationship between Michael and Hanna never increased emotionally.. The story jumped from subject to subject.. the only thing that held the movie together was the performance of Kate Winslet and young Michael(David Kross).. Kate was good throughout the movie.. You will see the movie and think about it for 5 minutes.. it will not reach your heart.. Altogether a movie that could have been more emotional and more intense.. This is where I miss Clint Eastwood...",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
You'll cry your heart out!,"The Reader is apparently the first ever movie which made me cry at the end. Filled with a gorgeous story, great performances and sharp screenplay, the movie is more than just a movie to us.

Based on a German novel, the movie is a sad, cheerful, and quite shattered story but it couldn't have been better.

Didn't do much for me,"A film that I rarely, if ever, got caught up in. It felt like the kind of movie that is based on a much better novel. A 15 year old boy (David Kross, played by Ralph Fiennes as an adult) meets up with a strange older woman (Kate Winslet) and, before long, they have a passionate, tumultuous affair. This first section of the film is pretty good, bringing to mind some of the great, erotic movies about sexual affairs, like maybe Last Tango in Paris. Less erotic than that, really, but it's pretty hot, and Winslet is extremely good in these scenes, carrying an unknown weight that is threatening to crush her. In the second section of the film, we learn just what her deal is. If you've seen any commercials or trailers for it, you already know the secret. If you don't, the film might work a little bit better, have a little more suspense. Personally, it was in the second section of the film where I really stopped caring. Kross is a law student observing a trial in which Winslet is the defendant. There's just too many scenes of Kross staring at Winslet from above, confused as to what he should do. Plus, where the theme of sexual politics and broken hearts is well enough done in the film, I thought it did a bad job building up any deep theme upon the historical events that are the focus of the film. It uses a very serious event, but I felt it didn't explore it in any but the most banal way, like it never even happened. I also thought Winslet started to flounder in these scenes. The final part works a tad better, but I just felt uninvolved by that point. European greats Bruno Ganz and Lena Olin have cameos.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated Oscar-bait Garbage,"After having seen The Reader, I found myself in a state of shock, amazement, and disbelief that the same film I had just wasted 2 hours of my life on had been recipient of so many awards, as well as having the seemingly unanimous admiration of film critics lavished upon it.The lovely and talented Kate Winslet stars as a secretary for a high-ranking Nazi Officer who years later will end up on trial for her role as an accomplice for many of the heinous crimes committed by her despicable low-life employer.What ensues is an odd mix to be sure: a statement on Pro-literacy, an art house period piece, soft-core titillation, and a Holocaust/WW II epic. It unfortunately fails with all four.In the film, Winslet's character carries on a torrid affair with a young man. Capitalizing on the well-known fact that Winslet is not shy in front of the camera, there are several explicit sex scenes featuring a fully nude Winslet - as is the case with countless previously released films in which she stars. I am no prude, but Winslet appears to be long past the point of being typecast in this type of role. Nothing wrong with that, but it has now reached a point where if she appears in a film in which her breasts are not bared, people in the audience may be asking for their money back.Winslet is most certainly a fine actress, but the abundance of praise she has received for her turn in ""The Reader"" is mind-boggling to say the least. She has given far better performances in just about everything else I've seen her in.Without question the sole motivation for any studio greenlighting material such as this are for Oscars. As a film fan and Oscar telecast viewer, it is rather disappointing to see the clout of Big Hollywood producers strong-arming the Academy year after year so exercises in mediocrity like ""The Reader"" monopolize the nominations in big categories. To see superior films such as ""The Wrestler"" and ""Gran Torino"" get snubbed in the top category is a real shame for movie fans.Time would be much better spent reading a book for 2 hours than seeing this garbage.Three stars for Kate, one star for Ralph Finnes portraying the boy as an adult, ZERO for the film.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautifully photographed, contemplative movie with understated performances.","It's not really difficult to be complimentary about this movie. Wonderful direction, quietly engrossing, great performances from all. Nice to see Bruno Ganz turning up too. There is something amazing about a film which successfully spreads itself across decades of people's lives, and this film is certainly successful in that respect. Really makes you think about the roles we play as humans. Are they really of our own making? How much power do we truly have in terms of being caught up something much, much bigger than one can even imagine? Probably the best thing that Ralph Fiennes has done in a while; Kate Winslet's star is obviously very much in the ascendancy these days, and I hope that we will be seeing a lot more of David Kross - a fine young actor.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Dubious and unremarkable.,"There's a rule in cinema that pretty much defines whether or not a story that centres on romance or love manages to engage its viewers in the manner in which it hopes. The best examples of such movies carefully warm us up to the individual characters and then slowly bring them closer and closer until we can't take it anymore; we will them on to find happiness within each other. The Reader, which ostensibly for the first half at the very least- can be described as a romantic drama, can be compelling watching, but only outside of its romantic interests. Hindered with lukewarm chemistry between the two leads and divulging in the obvious facets of a relationship with acute abrasiveness to the point where all subtle nuances are lost, the movie fails to establish its core with any resonance beyond its more obvious façade. As such, The Reader exists as a mostly dubious and unremarkable affair that only ever mildly engages, preferring instead to bore through laborious and dry characterisation than to compel through dynamism and chemistry needed to establish the central theme of love.For all intents and purposes, Bernhard Schlink's story (upon which David Hare's screenplay is based) is a tale divided into three distinct movements or, acts. Of course, most stories are of this design, yet the problem here is that Schlink, or rather, Hare makes his divisions all too obvious and fragmented to watch unfold. The seam that ties these three stories together are in place- two lovers and their tale of fleeting romance that lasted but a summer- yet the lines that separate them draw far too much attention to themselves than need be. The result is a story that can draw you in, only to perplex you moments later when you are whisked off to a different point in time. Furthermore, as is usually the case, there are acts here that are obviously stronger than others, and one can't help but feel that maybe there was a decent enough story to tell in just the first of the three. Yet indulging in a tale that transverses a series of decades, The Reader feels jarring in its approach, telling a story that has the potential to be gripping and moving, and yet never takes off thanks to its jittering and turbulent structure.Despite the feature's many technical problems that detract from the entirety of the experience however, there nevertheless remains a select array of elements that succeed in drawing you in. The first and foremost of these lies in the movie's aesthetics department, utilising soft, complementary photography that gives the film a sense of otherworldly realism that is always interesting to watch. Playing along beautifully in the background is the score penned by Nico Muhly, who up until this point has stuck mostly in Hollywood's back garden, so to speak. Muhly's score often complements the visuals in ways that echo the tranquil moments and the much more dissonant scenes built upon tension and conflict with much needed depth. It's a shame then that much of this inevitably goes to waste on a script that fails to establish character and performers who although delivering by the book renderings worthy of a look in for those interested in Oscar noodling- never come off the screen, failing to go beyond their caricature personas and truly touch the viewer.Taken as a whole, The Reader can be seen as a simple, lukewarm attempt at telling a story of love in all its complications- it also doesn't help that one of them was a guard for the SS. In this context, the movie can charm, but only with a timid sense of poignancy hinted at every half hour or so. The remainder of the feature then can't help but cave under the weight of such contrived pretensions from the director and his cast; we are told there is love here, and we can smell it somewhere off in the distance, but unfortunately that small glint of romance never reaches full climax, crescendo or even resonant motif. Instead The Reader bumbles along for the good part of two hours, middling in and out of mawkish clichés to the point where we honestly don't care where the characters go. Too much scope, with very little development or focus on the smaller aspects of what makes a love story compelling in the first place, The Reader is a troublesome, albeit slightly interesting story (historically speaking) that simply doesn't do enough to make it anything worth remembering.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,Romance

"Extraordinary script, wonderful directed by Daldry and acted by Winsleet, Feinnes and Kross!","This jewel of a movie delivers a rich and subtle moral message about the legacy of the Holocaust. It is a story about two people from different generations in Germany whose lives intertwine over the last 4 decades in the 20th century. Their relationship begins with an unseemly but wholly believable love affair between Michael, an intelligent, winsome, privileged 15 year-old, and Hannah, a 33 year-old trolley car attendant who's interior life is never made available us. We know her only in what we can glean from the outside. Tho she is worn and hardened, Winslet's physical beauty combines with the opacity of Hannah motives and Michael's youthful innocence to excite powerful sensual, erotic and complex tensions. We know Hannah from the beginning as a poor, lonely and emotionally remote older woman. Though illiterate, she loves good literature and shows unpolished intellectual complexity. From her first interaction with Michael, we know she is capable of acting out of human compassion. All this reminds us that her life might have been very different, if only . . . In contrast, Michael has more gifts, but despite his seemingly good family, his intelligence and winning nature, his whole life (like that of his generation) is haunted by this relationship and its effects not just his life but through him, his daughter's life as well.The affair lasts only a summer and though it dominates the 1st half of the movie. Over the next 40 years, they directly interact only twice in brief encounters, but Michael's whole life is shaped by this affair and metaphorically parallels the lives of Germans born after the horror of Nazism but indelibly stained by that history and their familial connections to those who lived through it. For we next learn that in the 1960's Hannah is charged along with other former SS guards of committing Nazi war crimes. While the story is told without heavy-handed moralism and only glancing reminders of the horrific historical events, viewers will be disappointed if they expect the rest of the movie to offer some resolution in the lives of these characters or if they think even a qualifiedly sympathetic view of Germans is morally intolerable in any work that touches on the Holocaust. For the full power of this movie is only apparent if the audience puts itself in the shoes of the main characters, and in the process sees them not only symbols of the German generations but expressions of our own frail humanity. Hannah's and Michael's lives are inextricably intertwined as are the lives of pre & post-war German generations. Tho they are Germans, they are, like all humans, trapped in the circumstances of our lives, the conditions that make us beneficiaries or prisoners thru complicity in the accidents and historical circumstances within which we are born and shaped, circumstances outside our control. Yet if we have any decency, we recognize and take moral responsibility for all our choices, whatever circumstances our choices place us in. If before her trial we wondered what Hannah might have been, we must also wonder her motives in leaving Michael, in fleeing from job promotions, in her love of literature and especially in her actions and choices at the trial. The power of this movie comes in making this imaginative identification with both Hannah & Michael, then reflecting on all the questions implied by the choices they make in their lives. that are left for us to puzzle about in each and every scene of this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not great, but nowhere near as bad as it is being made out to be","Like almost everyone, I was stunned on January 22 to find that The Reader was nominated for Best Picture. Not just because it was in and the likes of The Dark Knight, Gran Torino and Revolutionary Road were out, but because it seemed like the nomination was almost out of nowhere. Controversy about the nomination brewed, but obviously, nothing is going to change it. So with an intrigued mind, I went in expecting the worst movie ever made about the Holocaust.A young Michael Berg (David Kross) is ill, and is helped by a woman named Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet). She is young, but is about double Michael's age. He recovers in bed for months, and goes back to Hanna to thank her for her help. Shortly after, the pair begin a lustful affair that lasts only for a summer. Years later, as Michael sits in on a trial against female Nazi guards, he is shocked to find Hanna among the group.The film does a fairly adequate job jumping between this core story and the older Michael (Ralph Fiennes) remembering it and the fallout that came afterwards. He acts almost as a narrator, but more of an outsider looking into what his life was and became as the years went on.To say the film is a Holocaust film is not accurate. Sure, Hanna goes on trial for being a Nazi guard during the war, but outside of these scenes (and minor, haunting scenes in Auschwitz), the film takes place almost entirely in Germany well after the war. It is obviously easy to classify the film as a Holocaust film, but it spends more time dwelling on everything that came after than it does even mentioning the events that transpired. It is an intriguing angle, and one that does not come around too often in mainstream cinema.But the crux of the film is in the love story between Michael and Hanna. Seeing these two lovers passionately making love is at once just as beautiful as it is creepy. Director Stephen Daldry and the masterful Roger Deakins use very soft angles to express the feelings these two have for each other. And even with the immense amount of nudity, it is very tastefully done. A lot of time is spent lingering on the naked, imperfect flesh of both actors, and it helps to express the emotional hold these two have on each other.Unfortunately, it never seems to be explained why the pair gets together in the first place. We understand some of the motivations, but we never have a clear idea why Hanna would risk so much by having an affair with so young a man. In fact, the first scene the pair has that involves their love is jarringly unbalanced. It is powerful enough to evoke an immediate response, but just seems bizarre later on. Their relationship is vaguely acceptable (albeit slightly disturbing), but it hinges on so little that you wonder why these two have such a strong emotional bond. It almost seems weird to think, but with so much time spent on these early scenes, you would expect a bit more to be discussed and explained, as opposed to merely leaving it to the vices of Michael's older mind, remembering the majority of it as it happened.Another unfortunate thing is the lack of development in Michael and Hanna. Their backstories are never really explained before they meet each other, and the most we learn about Hanna other than her ""secret"" is the bit about her being a Nazi guard. And even then, we learn very little of what she did, or why she did it. We get no explanations about what lead up to Michael's illness, nothing on how he ended up in law school, and even less on the events of his adulthood. We merely get mentions and vague ideas to help establish who he has become. These two are clearly well written characters, but not enough to make the audience feel like they were truly developed. There is too much of an enigmatic side to both characters that one will never feel satisfied with what is covered (even if it would have dragged the film out longer than it is already).Relative newcomer Kross is fabulous in his role. He helps hold the film on his shoulders alongside Fiennes, but he delivers the bravest performance of anyone. Sure, Fiennes is great and very subtle in his role, but he is not the powerhouse that Kross is. Seeing him develop from a teenager to a young man is an exercise is astonishing, and seeing his emotional range makes me wonder why we have very little American actors that can pull off similar feats. He just seems to know exactly how to tap into Michael's psyche, and knows just what darkest depths this character feels he has gotten himself into. Watching him question his ethical judgment merely through facial contortions is worth a review all in itself. He has sadly gone underrated through the awards circuit, and it is really a shame. I can only hope he keeps it up with work like this.Winslet is just as great as you have heard. Much like in Revolutionary Road, she is a character going through an existential crisis plagued by tragedy and heartbreak. She plays Hanna very coldly, only letting the audience in at a few points. She wants us to feel the character's pain, and she wants us to see her as the confused individual that she is. Her performance is strong, and her emotions even stronger. But she lacks the will to make this as devastating a portrayal as in Road, so it seems rather eerie that the Academy picked this role instead.It's not great, but The Reader is not as bad as most have made it out to be. The story just needed to be as strong as the performances.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unsatisfying execution boosted by Winslet,"The Reader, starring Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes and set against the backdrop of the Holocaust, is at times tiresome and plodding, offering a unique plot (boy has affair with older woman, finding out later she was a Nazi guard) and a strong performance by Winslet and very little else. Its main problem seems to be that it simply doesn’t know what it wants to tell the viewer, what lessons it wishes to impart. As a result, its identity shatters into the proverbial million little pieces, each less interesting than the last.Michael Berg (David Kross) is 15 and on the verge of falling under two spells: first, scarlet fever, from which he recovers in a few months, and then Hanna (Winslet), the older woman who helps him when he becomes ill. It is from this latter spell, though, that Michael never recovers; he feels the impact of their short, summer affair until the end of the movie (forty years later).As romances go, it’s pretty sweet for the teen: he gets to sleep with a sexy older woman who desires only one thing (other than his sinewy body, of course): for him to read to her whatever trips his fancy. It’s a symbiotic relationship; he’s happy to have found a kindred spirit and ecstatic - pardon the term - to find an outlet for his hormones. She, on the other hand, is happy for his company and to hear him recite works of classic literature.But as all affairs do, theirs ends abruptly, with nary an explanation, and that’s the last young Michael sees of Hanna, until he’s in law school years later, and as a field trip he’s in the very courtroom where a group of female, ex-Nazi guards is being charged with war crimes. Lo and behold, one of the guards is Hanna! The story is related in flashback through the memories of the adult Michael, played by Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes is a fine (ha) actor, of course, but it seems he’s always stuck with these repressed, completely controlled roles. Distant, Michael’s called in the movie, an emotional cipher. Michael attempts, for decades, to come to grips with two dilemmas: why did Hanna leave him, and is her alleged Nazi past true? For me, I didn’t much care about his first dilemma; of course she left him, because she’s like twice his age and he was the clingy, controlling type. I was more concerned with the latter dilemma, because the trailer leads you to believe there’s some dispute about that. But this isn’t a courtroom drama. It’s more of a romance melodrama with serious undertones about the choices we make and the responsibility we marshal. The suggestion is made in the movie that the German people are looking for someone on whom to pin the blame of the Holocaust, and who better than guards following orders? Really, the film has just one thing going for it, although it’s a doozy: Kate Winslet, who electrifies the screen even when she’s not on it. Her vulnerable, conflicted Hanna is nurturing and distant, just as Michael would turn out; we can only guess at her true feelings, but Winslet is so talented that with a mere glance she can turn our perceptions on edge. She is this film, inside and out, and the fact that she also gets naked doesn’t hurt matters.The Reader perhaps overreached its goals, whatever they may be. It admirably tries to give us a main character who is not noble and good of heart in all things, but it fails to give us a solid reason to care about the proceedings other than as if we were being read a tale set in a faraway land in a distant time.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Challenging and Provocative,"Ask any number of people to describe an event, and they will all do so slightly differently. This is because each of our experiences and our own personal psychologies influences how we perceive the world. This being the case, then how can justice be truly blind?Michael Berg (David Kross) becomes ill one day, but is helped by a passing woman. Later on, he tracks down the woman, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) and they engage in a passionate affair. After falling in love, Hanna suddenly disappears, leaving Michael stunned and heartbroken. They encounter each other again years later, when Hanna is on trial for murders during the Holocaust (Michael is a law student observing the trial).The film touches on many themes, including command responsibility, the theory versus the actuality of justice, what constitutes morality and others. These are challenging topics, all the more potent when they involve the something as dark and horrible as the Holocaust. It is a credit to the filmmakers that not only are all of these themes and ideas presented intelligently and in ways that stir our minds, but they never make the film exploitative.Kate Winslet is easily one of the most exciting and versatile actresses alive today. She finally won a long overdue Oscar for her performance as Hanna, and she is wonderful. Aloof but naiive, Hanna is a fascinating individual and is brilliantly realized by Winslet (I have one minor quibble...when she is shown in old age, Winslet doesn't adjust her voice, but that's hardly worth mentioning). As Michael, David Kross matches her beat for beat. He's also stand-offish, but he's fallen helplessly in love with Hanna, which changes his life forever, and leads to an extraordinarily complex moral quagmire. Ralph Fiennes has a small role as the Older Michael, but we can see the similarities of a man whose picking up the pieces of a traumatic life.The film is superbly constructed by Stephen Daldry The film hits the correct note every time, however the film's ending is a little too oblique.

Rewarding nudity,"""But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading."" Gertrude, HamletKristin Scott Thomas in I Have Loved You So Long has competition from Kate Winslet in The Reader for best actress of the year 2008. The Reader has competition from Boy in the Striped Pajamas and Defiance for the best Holocaust film of 2008.The real winners in this sample of high-profile film competition are those of us who love good movies. The message is also that similar themes abound this year as filmmakers are in concert about the issues most important to a populace reacting uncharacteristically in a recession and war year by preferring more serious films at a time when escapism would have been though to be the operative guide.Set throughout the major decades of the twentieth century, The Reader tells of 15-year old Michael Berg (David Kross) having a three-month affair with the older Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) and viewing his life as an attorney who meets up with her again. Although the older woman-younger man motif works well when it moves apace, most often it lingers like long takes from the adolescent idyll, Twilight. The difference is, of course, rewarding nudity and physical and emotional connection not given to that vampire lightweight.When Reader gets to the trial, it picks up considerably from its languid pace although never reaching the potential of drama and insight such a setup should offer the playwright, David Hare. Bruno Ganz as the law professor is a welcome part of the denouement.It's Winslet's movie throughout, and she retains a stoic innocence consistent with her character. Ralph Fiennes as the older Michael never impresses me because, with the exception of his brutal turn in Schindler's List, Fiennes frequently plays variations of the most soulful-eyed depressive on the planet. He's very good at the role. As the title implies, reading is a motif that ties the major sections and characters together nicely.

A brilliant and simply stunning film,"David Kross promises to be a young talent that is waiting to explode in films, and his role in THE READER is a mesmerizing and stunning role for a young man who learned English in order to play in the film. Kross and Winslet are glorious in scenes which are both of a tender nature, and at times frightening with the intensity of two tigers waiting to claw one another. The film is beautifully shot, locations are in complete relation to the story, and watching the face of David Kross look at Winslet is a treasure to behold. Stephen Daldry has directed an immensely important film of human flaws, coupled with the history of World War II Germany, and Kate Winslet better take the Globe and Oscar home for THE READER.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
a German drama ruined by English actors,"This is just another drama exploring the jaded topic of German guilt and redemption. Compared with some recent German films (e.g. Der Untergang, Die Weller, Baader-Meinhof Complex, and The Life of Ohers), this British made film based on a German theme lacks authenticity from several angles of view:1) Kate Winslet's fake German accent is unbearable to listen to. Foreign accent is only applicable to a person who lives in another country. The fact is that Hanna Schmitz was a German woman living in Germany, why would she have to speak a foreign language to her fellow-countrymen in her own country? If the film is intended for English-speaking audience, English language should be spoken naturally as the story unfolds naturally. By adding German accent only make the film seem more contrived. It defeats the purpose.2) Kate Winslet did a good job acting a simple woman with tough exterior and a soft heart. But because of her falsified accent, her acting became wooden and stilted, lacking spontaneity. Especially in the love-making scenes, both actors were slow and awkward, showing no passion at all. If you think this is the German style, then you should see ""Baader-Meinhof Complex"" which will give you a real picture of how Germans make love.3) Ralph Fiennes, though beautifully acted as a mature deep-thinking person, bears no resemblance to the young Michael Berg at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A movie with substantial flaws,"This movie exemplifies hyperbole. The accolades that this movie won are leaps and bounds beyond what it truly deserves. I'm not trying to argue that Kate Winslet didn't do a wonderful job, she did, nor am I arguing that underneath there aren't strong qualities, but this movie is certainly nothing special. Unfortunately this is an example of a film getting lost in the bubble of Hollywood where some things take on a life of their own.Movies about guilt, pride, loss of innocence, have to walk a fine line in their story telling. This movie falls apart with it's inability to artfully hold the story together. The danger when dealing with such subject matter is that in order to make it feel real the characters must show emotional damage. The Reader does a masterful job of showing people who's lives have all been damaged by sin. However, the trap that can be sprung, and that this movie falls for, is that the characters become unidentifiable with. The cold nature of the main characters, especially Hana, keeps the audience at arms length from growing attached to anyone. Watching a 2+ hour movie without anyone to feel for is a hollow feeling.To best sum up my feelings about this movie I will draw a comparison to Benjamin Button. Both movies have such strong source material to draw from, a wealth of talent and limitless potential but yet neither accomplished much that hasn't already been done. The Reader has been done before and done better by other movies. It leaves too many loose ends to be considered a strong movie, interesting and important plot developments are either not explored or left hanging. Winslet is by far the best part of this film, it's unfortunate that the rest of the film didn't live up to her performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very well done film,"The Reader (2008) is a very interesting film, unlike any other I've seen. The story focuses on Michael Berg, played by Ralph Fiennes and David Kross (younger Michael). It's about him and Kate Winslet's character, Hanna. When Michael was 15, he meet Hanna and they began an affair, an affair that consisted of sex and reading. Michael would read to Hanna and then they would make love. They did this for a summer and then Hanna left. A few years later, Michael was in law school and was witnessing a trial, a trial that involved Hanna. We learn things about her past through this trial. One thing that I absolutely love about this film, is the acting. The acting is so unbelievably great, especially on Winslet's part, who I believe is one of the greatest actresses Hollywood has ever seen. She delivers such a deeply raw performance, we as the audience feel everything she feels, the same goes for Fiennes and Kross. I just want to give special recognition to Kross, because I absolutely adored him here! Even as a young actor, he gives a very skilled performance. I also liked the writing, it's very well done. I like that, through the writing, we get to know these characters. Overall, it's a very intelligent film and it's recommended",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What would you have done ? She asks,"Crime,guilt,punishment and redemption (or lack of it) are weighty subjects. They all came together in Stephen Daldry's adaptation of Bernhard Schlink's book of the same title. It started out aimlessly, looking much like a story about boy coming-of-age with an older woman. By the movie's end it is not about that but how we deal with guilt. Hannah, the older woman, carries a wartime past that explains her hardened exterior and distance. Sensing the boy,Michael, is wanting more out of just sexual relationship, she abruptly moved away. Flash forward to years later Michael, a law student, sees Hannah again, in a courtroom trial where Hannah is on trial along with half dozen other women for being camp guards, aiding and abetting the Holocaust. This is a fresh angle among Holocaust dramas. We are witnessing ordinary people, not to be excused, followed the herd, even it was churning toward evil. To what degree are each one responsible ? It can't be ""just following order"". Post-war German guilty and retribution is on display. Hannah and her cohorts are charged with not freeing the prisoners while their shelter - a church, was burning. Hannah did not defend her action. Michael struggles with a secret which could have helped Hannah, but he chooses not to go forward. The great Roger Ebert drew this parallel - both Hannah and Michael rejected the chance to do good, and are living with that guilt. It is also important Hannah does not get rehabilitated in the end. Such ending would have pleased the masses but casts nothing about penitence and atonement. Hannah accepts and carries her punishment. Michael carries his guilt differently, in personal relationships and enduring painful history. The book cleverly uses readings of literature as common vehicle linking Michael and Hannah together. ""Read to me first, then we make love."" says Hannah. Many find the first half of the movie in which there is much puppy love/sex the high point. I can understand that because the latter half strikes a completely somber and serious tone distinctly different than the first part. However it draws for me a more powerful conclusion as we are thrusted into facing the difficult subjects of generational guilt and self-condemnation.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
sensitive treatment of a difficult subject,"I watched this riveting movie without prior knowledge of the book which it is sourced from by Bernard Schlink. Some reviewers had implied that it is hard to follow given a complex flashbacks plotting device but neither I nor Jeana had any difficulty in keeping up.It's very good. Kate Winslet's performance is, in my view, a career high and the young Michael Berg, played by David Kross, puts in an outstanding turn as Winslet's young (underage) lover, before the part is taken over beautifully by Ralph Feinnes. Lena Olin has only a very small part at the end of the movie, playing the daughter of a Holocaust survivor but her role is fundamental to the film's denouement and she carries it off stunningly.I'd rather not spoil the plot by revealing the key central twist which you can see coming, but it is very effective and takes the third act of the movie into a new, and unexpected dimension. The first act is essentially a seduction and the second, a courtroom drama. All three are paced slowly but carefully. In lesser hands this film could have gone so wrong in so many ways but the acting is supplemented by great writing (David Hare - well, what do you expect) direction (Steven Daldry) and Cinematography (Roger Deakins whose last brilliant movie was No Country For Old Men). Indeed the movie is nominated for best film, writing directing and supporting actress at the Golden Globes. Quite rightly in my opinion.It's very moving and given the nature of Winslet's role it's a tribute to her and the production team that you sympathise with her throughout, even though she clearly would not find universal favour.7.5 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Engaging and erotic.,"The Reader is really 2 movies is one, essentially:The first is about a boy who, despite being 15, starts a sexual relationship with a woman(played by Kate Winslet-aka Rose in Titanic) over twice his age. Their relationship consists of 3 things: sex, bathing, and reading. The affair lasts a summer, and they don't connect afterwards. This covers roughly 45% of the movie.The latter section sees these 2 meet again after the woman is given a life sentence for aiding the Nazis in the Holocaust.Knowing her true heart-that she wouldn't WANT someone killed, the boy(now a grown man played by Ralph Fiennes) finds the books he read to her as a boy and records them unto cassette tapes for her to listen to.Of course, many details follow, but these summaries are a quick basis without being spoiler heavy-I hope this didn't give too much!Like I said, this movie is entertaining from start to finish. If I had to pick one flaw, it would be that the dialogue was a bit quiet, but other than that, there's nothing I'd complain about!While some scenes are more engaging then others, there is never a scene in The Reader that doesn't grab the attention of the viewer.However, I should tell you: if nudity scenes offend you, this movie is NOT for you! Kate Winslet is nude often, and the 15 year old has his share as well.Usually excessive nudity bothers me(see my review of The Wolf of Wall Street), but this movie uses it for showing the immorality of the situation, and not used just to be there.If you want a romance movie that is very entertaining, The Reader is the book, er, movie...to pick up!Note: I recommend this for ages 16-17 and up.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An adaptation that adds something,"Salman Rushdie, in an essay on adaptation, remarked ""Something is always lost in translation; and yet something can also be gained."" This film adaptation from Bernhard Schlink's novel directed by Stephen Daldry, previously known for ""Billy Elliot"" and ""The Hours"" loses some of the depth of the novel, but at the same time Kate Winslett brings alive the central character of Hanne, the former SS guard in her thirties who has a brief affair with Michael the narrator when he is 15 years old far more vividly than Schlink was able to in the novel. David Hare's screenplay follows the novel fairly closely, but Kate Winslett, often by body language alone, is able to tell her character's story so as to make her understandable, if not forgivable. David Kross and Ralph Fiennes, the two actors playing Michael, who grows up to be a stiff legal academic (boy, do I know the type) also do a remarkable job.The more stringent critics would say that nothing can be said in defence of Nazism, but they rather miss the point. Schlink and the movie makers are trying to explain why people can behave in such a terrible way, not to excuse what they did. Are the critics saying that Hanne should not have been portrayed as a physically attractive woman? Because she is attractive we can more readily accept that the narrator, at 15, will fall in love with her. He is, of course at that stage completely unaware of her history. He does not even notice that she cannot read. Later, when he knows the full story he is indeed consumed by guilt, but it his not the affair he is guilty about, but his failure to help her, his betrayal in fact.This segues into the larger question of how can the post-war generation of Germans come to terms with what was done by many of their parents. Neither Schlink nor the film makers have an easy answer to this. Schlink writes ""Whatever validity the concept of collective guilt may or may not have, morally or legally – for my generation of students it was a lived reality."" It did produce a generation who were anti-Nazi. Schlink again ""It converted the passive suffering of shame into energy, activity, aggression."" As to losses in translation, the most irritating change was to recast the linear structure of the novel into flashbacks, which added nothing and made the story harder to follow. Some of the earlier scenes with Ralph Fiennes as the older Michael don't make much sense. But Kate Winslett carries the day with a gutsy and convincing performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing,"I can't say I didn't like the movie, but to me, the success of it sounded greatly overrated. The movie works with incredibly strong story, however, the filmmakers in my opinion didn't process it into an atmosphere and plot the story truly deserved. The first segment of the movie takes part in 1950ties, and you could say it's long and even boring. Two others are in 60ties and 90ties. The characters are not lively enough, they're distant and reserved - they only deliver very specific parts of themselves that are very closely related to story. The plot is very passive and often predictable.Seeing the movie and reading the movie's description on IMDb does not make much of a difference.That's in my opinion very sad, because the story had excessive potential to be breathtaking and stunning journey into WWII tragic events and people's lives affected by it, taking in account the human aspect of involved individuals.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's almost believable as a true story,"There are so many different perspectives this movie allows you to look at it from but at the end of the day I think it's a beautifully composed story of a heinous woman, or a woman who partook in a heinous act. There are several stories taking place, first was this enticing relationship Michael had with Hanna when they were both younger, we then see how that affected him later emotionally, then Hanna's history with the Nazi's although her time there isn't really explored or shown, it's just talked about post-bellum.It's hard for me to properly articulate how I feel about the it because my emotions kept changing throughout the duration of the movie. I'm a sucker for romance so that's the perspective that stuck with me the most, even though the movie was about more than just that, I think it's more about questioning our view on morality, how distinctly we separate a good person from an evil one; because in the first part of the movie, we're shown the caring humane side of Hanna towards Michael who was only a stranger then, despite her somewhat cold tone she showed heart and looked after him. I think she did care quite a lot, but didn't yet love him, or love him the way Michael did her; which was were she made her first ""mistake"" in regard to her and Michael, when he asked her if she loved him and and she nodded in agreement. I understand why, a story we've seen before were someone says they love the other out of fear of hurting them because they actually care. Can't speak to whether it's wrong or right but it is justifiable.But after she leaves him, and Michael learnt of what she'd taken part in, it made it worse, because this person, the first person micheal was ever in love with, not only left but did horrid things as a prison guard. That's when both micheal and us the viewers would ask ""do you really ever know someone?"" Or how could this person I know be capable of such without me noticing?"" type questions. And this essentially stunted his emotional growth and made him distant.I acknowledge that her illiteracy shouldn't make us forget or forgive the things she'd done, but the shame she felt became her undoing, because that's what made the difference between her getting 20yrs in prison while her more hostile looking friends only got four. Writing that report. Michael had a chance to help but that's were we see he's stuck in between two minds.Are good people capable of evil, can an inhumane person still be good? I don't know. I don't recall Hanna speaking ill or hatred towards the Jews, seemed to her she just took a job and she did it.The story was so beautifully written and acted out by the cast that you're taken by surprise when you find out what the movies about. From a forbidden romance of a young boy and older woman to a war-crime film with moral dilemma. The acting by both David and Ralph as Michael and Kate Winslet was astounding that the movie is believable as a true story.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Engaging Start, Uneven Finish","The first half of the film is particularly engaging, focusing on the forbidden romance between the young Michael Berg and the enigmatic Hanna Schmitz, played with depth and vulnerability by Kate Winslet. The film's exploration of their relationship is both captivating and unsettling in its complexity.The cinematography and period detail add a layer of authenticity to the story, making the film visually striking and emotionally resonant. However, as The Reader progresses into its second half, the tone shifts in a way that might catch you off guard, especially if you're not familiar with the source material. The narrative takes a sharp turn into the Holocaust story, which, while important, feels somewhat jarring after the intimate drama of the first half. The film's focus shifts from the personal to the somewhat historical, and this change in tone can feel a bit abrupt, making the latter part of the film less engaging than the first. The emotional intensity that the film builds so effectively early on starts to wane, leaving the final act feeling somewhat bland and detached.While The Reader remains a well-crafted film with strong performances, the unexpected narrative shift and the less compelling second half might leave you wishing the film had maintained the more intimate focus that made its beginning so absorbing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Problematic Movie, Problematic Ending: POSSIBLE SPOILERS","Kate Winslet deserved the Oscar she won for her role as Hanna Schmitz, who snares a teenage lover, Michael Berg (David Kross) and later emerges as an accused war criminal, sentenced after a trial to life in prison. Michael, then a law student, observes the trial throughout. Fast forward. The boy whom Hanna bedded, now an adult (Ralph Fiennes), acts after a long delay on a key issue he recognized during Hanna's trial and did nothing about, though it might have brought Hanna a much shorter prison term. Hanna is illiterate and could not have written the report on the crime which she and other female guards committed. Her confession in open court that she wrote the report is all that separates her from the other guards who receive significantly shorter sentences. The younger Michael does not tell the court that Hanna cannot read or write, but the older Michael begins sending Hanna tape after tape after tape of things he had read to her during their summer of love-making and much, much more. From the tapes, Hanna learns to read and learns to write. She is no longer illiterate. (I'll omit the ending. No reason to spoil it for those who haven't seen the film.)Hanna's reason for not defending herself in court -- shamed by her illiteracy -- is comprehensible (barely). The reason Michael, the law student, gives for not disclosing the truth to the court, is that he should not violate her desire to keep her shame private. But the actions of the adult Michael are difficult, if at all possible, to comprehend. It must have taken him many months, perhaps a couple of years, to record all the books he sends her and why does he do it? Memory of a distant love affairs? That scarcely seems a satisfactory motivation. Guilt at having failed to rescue her from her own lie? That isn't a sufficient explanation either. Still in love with her? No reason to think that's the case.What we are left with then is a superb piece of acting in service of a film that, ultimately, fails of its own weight. That failure does not affect young David Kross's excellent acting during his love affair with Hanna, but it undermines the character of the law student that he later becomes and it leaves Ralph Fiennes without a sturdy foundation for his turn as the older Michael. As a result, despite Kate Winslet's outstanding performance, I was disappointed by this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An OK film with interesting aspects and good performances but lacking in the total delivery,"The Awards season always generates buzz and also means the sudden release of lots of worthy and good films all at about the same time. Of course this doesn't mean that all of them are good and just because some have hype for acting reasons does not mean that the film itself will be good, vice versa and so on. Coming to The Reader, the viewer already has pressure on them  the film is one of these contenders for awards, it has some heavy-weight performances and it is about a typically worthy subject in the Holocaust. The pressure to be overwhelmed and deeply moved by it is there for all to see  some say films will make heavy plays for Oscar but they do the same for the audience. The reality is not always so (both for the Oscars and for the audience). With The Reader the film is very much on the back of the actors and I left with the impression that that's all it had in its bag.The story is a reasonably interesting twist on the Holocaust drama as it is seen in retrospect through a case convicting those who worked at the death camps, with a focus on Hanna. We meet her via the teenage Michael and for the majority of the film we know nothing more than her love of being read to and their sexual relationship. It offers the potential for exploration of guilt, of personal responsibility, of morality in the face of a mob mindset, of forgiveness  all of these are here to be had and the cast suggested that the script must really do this, hence their involvement. The thing is that the film doesn't manage to do this to any significant degree. The first half of the film spends far too long on the relationship between Michael and Hanna, because it has nowhere near enough to do with it and it ends up slightly dull as it goes along.The second half is the guts of the film where secrets come out, things are confronted and issues are on the table for moral debate, whether within the characters or in the group of law students who seemingly exist to allow this debate to occur. Here is where my doubts over the film manifested themselves in proper, if slight, disappointment. The second half, you see, is interesting. That's it. Interesting. It is not challenging, it is not impacting, it is not moving and it is not thoughtful. I honestly no idea why it failed to really punch home on any of these because at times the concept and the characters make it feel like an open goal of sorts. It is a disappointment when all's said and done but thanks to the cast it does still engage to a point.Everyone is good. Winslet gets the praise and rightly so as hers is a difficult and complex character. That she gets so much out of it when the material does want to explore her very much as part of the narrative is to her credit. Kross works alongside her very well, with a strong performance that matches her in so much as the material needs him to. Fiennes is a good future character and I liked what he did despite having the challenge of remoteness from the majority of the film and also little screen time. The problem is that everyone is good enough to make me yet again be bothered by how the script is not better so that they may have had more to work with.The Reader is a big worthy film with big worthy names giving big worthy performances. Problem is that it doesn't do half as much as it should with the subject. The concept is fine and the cast deliver it with all they can but yet the material fails to deliver a really thoughtful piece full of debate and impact  the way it is set up suggests it was going to be all about this but instead it is only an OK film with interesting aspects and good performances but lacking in the total delivery.",,Anonymous,Romance
What would you have done?,"Based on the 1995 novel by Bernhard Schlink, The Reader (Der Vorleser) tackles difficult ethical standpoints in post-WWII Germany.Fifteen-year-old Michael Berg (David Kross) has a passionate summer affair with Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet), a mysterious woman twice his age. She suddenly disappears but accidentally resurfaces in his life eight years later as a defendant in a trial he is observing as a law student. It culminates in a decision to either keep or divulge a secret important to Hanna that Michael knows could absolve her but damn him and the cause of those inadvertently affected by her unfortunate actions.Oscar nominated director Stephen Daldry (for Billy Elliot, The Hours and The Reader) shows his trademark restraint and skillful handling of top-notch actors in this heavy drama about human complexity. The story itself is so open to interpretation and could've been coarsely treated but Daldry and his remarkable cast show immense sensitivity that it becomes difficult not to feel for each one.After seven nominations, Winslet finally wins an Oscar for Best Actress for her stunning performance as Hanna. She is able to make you have mixed feelings of overwhelming sympathy and intense disgust for such a simpleton. It makes me wonder though, why she has to keep shedding her clothes in most of her roles when she doesn't really need to, with her incredible talent. Kross is a revelation and holds his own screen presence against such a formidable co-star. It was also interesting to find out that the production had to wait till he turned 18 to film his love scenes and that he had to learn English for this breakout role. Ralph Fiennes plays the older Michael, and while I originally thought it was a waste to cast him for this part, I later realized how crucial his eyes and expressions were in communicating volumes of feeling, even in the slightest of dialogues.While heavy, The Reader is still a must-see, if only to get back to contemplating on your basic humanity. ""What would you have done?"" is the question Hanna poses to the judge, and would be interesting to ask yourself. Elements of many parts of this movie would make for a fruitful after-movie discourse.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good Movie, but Never for Oscar Nomination","In 1995, in Berlim, the lawyer Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) recalls his adolescence in 1958 in Newstadt, West Germany, when he was fifteen years old (David Kross). While walking on the street, he becomes ill and the thirty-six year-old stranger Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) helps him to go home. Three months later, in summertime, he is recovered and he pays a visit to Hanna to thank her kindness and they immediately begin a secret affair. Their encounters always begin with Michael reading a book and then going to the bed with Hanna, until the day Hanna vanishes, leaving the teenager brokenhearted. In 1966, Michael is a law student of the Heidelberg Law School and his class goes to a trial of Nazi war crimes. For Michael's surprise, he finds that Hanna was a former S.S. concentration camp guard and is being accused in the courtroom of several crimes. Michael lives a dilemma: should he disclose a secret that may save Hanna from a life sentence?.""The Reader"" is a good movie, but never for an Oscar nomination. The story is predictable and falsely moralist with the despicable attitude of Michael in court, hiding the secret that could have saved Hanna from her most severe accusation. In my opinion, Kate Winslet is presently one of the best contemporary actresses after Meryl Streep, but she could never win an Oscar performing a German character without speaking German. That is one of the major differences from a great number of Europeans and non-Europeans actors and actresses, the skill for languages.One exception is the fabulous Meryl Streep that not only learned a Polish accent but also learned how to speak German to make ""Sophie's Choice"". Kate Winslet deserves an Oscar for her magnificent filmography, but never for ""The Reader"", which is another movie about the Holocaust, the favorite theme for nomination in Hollywood. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Leitor"" (""The Reader"")",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"engaging and sad, perhaps too sad, with a weaker third act","Maybe I should've read the book. Ironic that a film that has a crucial point being illiteracy should be seen by me, having not read the very, very highly acclaimed book it's based upon. I saw the film with my wife and mother, both of whom had read the book, and they claimed they had a more enjoyable experience (if that's the term used for a tragic tale of first love gone bad and/or strange in the long-term) as they could fill in whatever gaps were missing from what was, according to them, a faithful adaptation. Taking the film on its own terms, how it works in telling its story, it's certainly better than the stuff previous ""Oscar-baiter"" from Stephen Daldry, the Hours. Certainly Kate Winslet helps every mili-second she's on-screen, and the fact that it's two movies, sort of, makes it interesting when things start to get a little detached.The first half, what could have made on its own an absorbing story of lust and obsession and hills and valleys in a relationship, is about a near-Last Tango set-up where after a mid-30s German woman (Winslet) in post WW2 Germany helps a 15 year old get home he comes back in some attraction, and soon they start an illicit affair kept pretty much to her (Hannah's) quarters. The big thing is reading to Hannah: she can't read or write, so ""kid"" reads to her before and after (I'm surprised not during) their sexual endeavors. But, of course, the relationship turns sour since, frankly, the kid Michael gets interested in girls his own age and is screwed in the head over it... It screws with him still when this first sort of movie ends and the second one begins, which is when Michael is a little older, a law student, and watching Hannah on trial for war crimes she committed at Auschwitz.Sound like fun date stuff? Not exactly, though it may hit the spot for the couple looking for that love story where compromises are few and the consequences are plenty (i.e. if Michael comes forward during the trial with information that could help her a tiny bit, which he doesn't, what will that mean for Hannah who does not read or write and did not in fact write the letter she's accused of writing detailing what to do against prisoners). If there seems to be some kind of problem, and this is just a guesstimate from someone, again, not very familiar with the book, is that in two hours, even for something that's supposed to be a short read, is crammed in. We see a montage of Michael reading countless books on tape for Hannah while she's in jail. It's hard to feel any sympathy for her since, frankly, she's a war criminal in the worst possible way. But there is an identification with the boy who becomes a man, and the essential elements of pride and dignity and intelligence that are touched upon.At the same time it's also a pretty good love story, one that starts as hot and heavy and probably immature on one end and transforms into something that is kind of like making constant amends. It's maybe a little too polished at times- the musical score goes away at the mood as if it were Notes on a Scandal, which isn't quite right- and without Winslet or Fiennes or for his few minutes Bruno Ganz it doesn't work nearly as well. The Reader does make for some involving storytelling, of something not usually considered which is the conscience of law vs love or the power of words spoken and stories told when a life to oneself (like Hannah's) is worth nothing much at all. It doesn't leave you feeling very good inside, but you'll feel rewarded for the performances and at the least the reasonably hot sex scenes (it is Kate Winslet doing her nude/sex thing after all).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Multiple Oscar candidate,"The reader more or less took me by surprise. And not just a little bit. I just saw it and i am almost speechless.OK, i cried several times.And yes i love Kate Winslet.Im still a bit emotional but ill try to be rational.The Reader is a love story. A love story against maybe the most grim circumstances it can be in. Or end up i should say, cause the first half of the movie takes up the character building, the evolving of the love. There is quite some nudity in that part, but i didn't find it out of place. It's supporting to the love, as it should be.The acting is great, specially Kate with her beautiful facial expression. It's never boring. It just took me and dragged me in more and more. It ends in a secret that is not to be told. While Kate aka Sarah finds herself in a difficult position. It turns into a morality movie, while the love keeps into the story, adding to the tension.This is the first movie i have seen that portrays the people that were actually camp guards in WW2, as human beings that thought they did right. It's not all black and white as we are so desperately willing to see it. (B & W... ?)Im sorry, i can write a whole book about this, but whats the use?We will make the same mistakes.

Strangely flat and lifeless,"Stephen Daldry's The Reader is based on a novel by Bernhard Schlink that grew out of an experience from the author's youth when he discovered that the teacher he had admired for his love of literature had a darker past. Shown through the lens of memory by an adult lawyer (Ralph Fiennes), the film is set in Berlin, thirteen years after the end of World War II. A fifteen-year old boy, stricken with a sudden illness in an apartment doorway on his way home from school is assisted by an older woman. Six months after his recuperation from Scarlet Fever, the boy returns with flowers. After the woman provides a bath for him to clean up from shoveling coal, he is initiated into sex. The woman is Hanna (Kate Winslet) who collects fares on the local streetcar and the boy is Michael Berg (David Kross), who returns every afternoon. Hanna also has a strange obsession.She wants to be read to and Michael eagerly complies, reading The Odyssey, The Lady With the Little Dog by Chekhov, Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn and even Lady Chatterley's Lover which she objects to. Then, one day she disappears without explanation and the film flashes forward eight years. Michael is in law school and his class led by their teacher Professor Rohl (Bruno Ganz) is observing the trial of Nazi war criminals. Shockingly, Michael observes that Hanna is one of six co-defendants, all former guards at concentration camps who, by their inaction, allowed three hundred Jews to be burned to death in a bombed church. He has to face the trauma of not only seeing his first love after many years but also finding out that she was perhaps the woman most responsible for the deaths of the prisoners the guards were assigned to watch.Sadly, Michael fails to reconnect with Hanna during the trial and views the proceedings from a distance. Though knows a secret that may help Hanna in her defense, he is unwilling to go the extra step to visit her in prison and try to convince her to help herself. The older Michael, now a lawyer, however, attempts to rekindle the emotions of his youth by sending her tapes in prison of him reading classic books. Adapted for the screen by David Hare, The Reader has an important story to tell, allowing us to gauge the reaction of the younger generation in postwar Germany to revelations of Nazi complicity among their elders. Unfortunately, however, I found it to be strangely flat and lifeless, undercut by an air of portentous self-importance and peopled with characters whose complexities and contradictions are never fully illuminated.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I love it!,"Great literature delivered through captivating narration has the ability to enchant and move listeners. ""The Reader,"" directed by Stephen Daldry, is a film that captures this essence while exploring the complex relationship between a young man and woman. The storyline is presented in a non-linear manner, tracing the lasting impact of their connection. The film's aesthetic is visually striking, set against the backdrop of Central Europe's stoic granite architecture.Kate Winslet delivers a heart-wrenching performance, taking the audience on an emotional journey that touches upon sensuality, literary ecstasy, and missed opportunities. Her commanding presence drives the narrative, with Ralph Fiennes and David Kross providing strong supporting performances.""The Reader"" is a celebration of the power of literature, the beauty of storytelling, and the importance of action.

Not impressive,"""It doesn't matter what I feel. It doesn't matter what I think. The dead are still dead.""I don't know, I just couldn't force myself to like this movie.

It just drags on really slowly portraying everyone as nothing more than depressed people with moral problems that, in my humble opinion, just don't make a lot of sense.

"""Well, what would you have done?""","The story based on a popular novel ""Der Vorleser"" by Bernhard Schlink, takes place over several decades from the 1950s through the 1990s.We start with a boy Michael Berg (David Kross) who is helped home by a streetcar ticket puncher Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet)when he contracts scarlet fever. After recovery, Michael goes to Hanna to thank her. One thing leads to another and they strike up a physical relationship. The relationship deepens and changes course when Michael discovers that Hanna likes to be read to. He ends up reading everything from the classics to comics. Then one day she disappears leaving Michael distraught.Eight years later Michael rediscovers her. Only this time Michael is a law student and Hanna is on trial for war crimes and accused of voluntarily joining the SS. Michael could save her from prison but at the expense of revealing her secret. What would you do?The story is not really about Michael (later played by Ralph Fiennes) and Hanna; it is more about how the different generations in Germany come to grips with their history.I have not read the book yet and am sure that this film is just a reflection of the story but it was played well enough to win an Oscar and be nominated for many more.I especially like the scene where Michael is reading Hamlet to Hanna. Hanna says that she does not understand it. Michael says (indignantly) it is a classic. She asked if he understands it and upon reflection, he says ""NO"".I will not go into the aspects of the media as Blu-ray is the norm and does not need to be described.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great book - shame about the movie,"The book was impressive. The film - up to the final scenes fairly gripping and fairly true to the book. The issues of legality versus morality well brought out; the effect of hidden secrets on people's lives; the effect of a love affair - all dramatic and excellently acted and portrayed. But . . . . . . having praised the good bits, why was this not a German language film with sub-titles (as was the much better 'The Lives of Others'). The cod German-English accents are a joke. Kate Winslet is very watchable - but the amount of gratuitous nudity unnecessary. I felt she was miscast, and there was too much 'look at me' in her role. (Kristin Scott Thomas better deserves the Oscar for 'Il y'a Longtemps Que Je T'aime). The other acting was excellent. Despite these criticisms, the film pretty well held me until the final scenes - in New York and at the graveside. Mawkish, over-sentimental and totally unnecessary.",,Anonymous,Romance

The Reader is a most compelling drama concerning two people during a time of trials concerning historical atrocities,"Just watched with my parents this very compelling drama about a man named Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) remembering his relationship with an older woman named Hanna Schmitz (Oscar-winning Kate Winslet) as a teenager (David Kross) and his later encounter with her when she went to trial for crimes committed during the Holocaust. The actors I mentioned gave really good performances. Also praise worthy is Lena Olin both as a mother and daughter survivors of concentration camps. Fine direction by Stephen Daldry of a screenplay by David Hare as adapted from the book by Bernhard Schlink.

It isn't what you think or feel; it's what you do that counts.,"If Kate Winslet, who won a Golden Globe for this performance, does not win the Oscar for the same role, then there is no justice in the world. She was absolutely incredible in a role that had her go from predator, to victim; from seemingly oblivious to the magnitude of what she did, to someone willing to take blame that wasn't hers to avoid embarrassment.It is extremely hard to critique this film without giving away the magnificent plot, so I will try my best to avoid anything that would do that.Bruno Ganz played a law professor that was critical to enjoying this movie because he made us think about the role of the individual, of the collective, of society, of everyone in the horrible massacre that was the Holocaust, and also makes us think of our role in the massacres that are going on around the world in Darfur and Iraq. Are we responsible by doing nothing? Can we really say we do not know what is going on? It was pointed out that there were 1000 concentration camps. Every German knew. What was their responsibility? What of the responsibility of the 52 million Americans who voted for Bush in 2004 knowing what was happening in Iraq and Guantanamo? One cannot avoid the comparisons, although the Jews had it far worse.Ralph Fiennes put in an incredibly good performance, but nothing compared to Winslet.

An amazing picture of human nature in love and despair -,"I will start by saying I have never seen a movie which made me feel the way The Reader does. It captures every emotion that can be experienced. I was in tears at one moment, and in a blank stare at another moment. Kate Winslet was incredible playing Hanna Shmitz. Her raw attitude and personality creates a clear visual of her character. David Kross shows his true potential playing Michael Berg - I see a prominent future in his acting career. It is very rare when a movie can move you in such a way as The Reader does. You get lost in the story and the characters. There is not one thing that I would want to change about this film. I have never had such a strong reaction to a movie. This movie shows the significance one person can have on another - even if it is only for a brief period of time. The affects an individual can make on another can be tremendous, and tragic. The love, the pain, and the heartache are all expressed with extreme care in this film. Stephen Daldry should not go without applause, as well as all the actors. This is a movie that will stand the test of time, and teach us of true human individuality, morals, and nature. A re-occurring thought was in my head throughout the film, ""Someone had this story in their head, in their mind - Somehow, someone created this beautiful story - Where do people come up with this?""

After The War.,"I can see that I am not the only person who missed this excellent drama upon first release, and in fact I actually avoided it at the time, not bothering. Friends raved about it and I was ho-hum. Now I wish I had seen the film in a cinema, given it's potent impact even through the hell of watching THE READER on commercial clogged Television. A revisit on DVD is now a must. Similar in structure to SOPHIE'S CHOICE another WW2 aftermath moral dilemma with time shifts and character revelations, THE READER is a completely absorbing and thrilling drama with superb casting and excellent production values. Made on a modest budget and with new comer David Kross' pivotal performance as the teen in love with older woman with a vile past (Kate Winslet) THE READER establishes itself strongly with a heady mix of sex and secrets. The scenes at the lake with his teen friends realising he is up to something are also evocative. A similar but more ghastly film was the 1971 film THE NIGHT PORTER with a role reversal and disgusting fetish. If you see it you can see the identity swap and the cruelty of attraction. THE READER has a sunny lead teen and a cold femme balance. The moral dilemma is not to be revealed but witnessed as you see the film for the first time.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Haunting Post-Holocaust Drama Falls Short Despite Solid Work from Winslet and Kross,"If you mixed Robert Mulligan's ""Summer of '42"" with Stanley Kramer's ""Judgment at Nuremberg"", you could likely come up with a melodramatic hybrid as lugubrious as this 2008 drama about post-WWII moral ambiguity and obsession. Adapted by playwright David Hare (""Plenty"") from Bernhard Schlink's critically acclaimed 1995 novel, the film directed by Stephen Daldry (""The Hours"") offers the veneer of an important subject in reflecting upon the years-later psychological aftermath of the Holocaust. The source book deals with the difficulties which subsequent generations have in comprehending the scope and magnitude of the war crimes However, the screenplay focuses more squarely on the passionate affair that develops between Hanna Schmitz, an enigmatic, controlling woman in her mid-thirties, and Michael Berg, an impressionable fifteen-year-old student in 1958 Berlin.The film begins well enough when the focus is primarily on these two characters with Hanna calling upon Michael to read to her during their discreet afternoon meetings. The affair ends abruptly, and he doesn't see her again until six years later when she goes on trial with several other women for contributing to the murder of 300 Jews while she was serving as an SS guard at Auschwitz. The plot turns on a key revelation that is quite obvious from the early scenes, yet it is at this point when the film loses momentum considerably. Daldry's excessive jumbling of the timeline does not help either in overcoming the increasingly convoluted storyline which has the older Michael conveying a deep sense of conflict over Hanna when she is found guilty and serves a life sentence.Making good cinema out of such introspection poses a challenge. We are meant to empathize with a man who is torn between protecting the subject of his youthful ardor and withdrawing from the horror of the crime for which she accepts accountability. When the plot threads wrap together with the characters' fates sealed, there is a pervasive sense of emptiness since Daldry and Hare cannot move us emotionally beyond the elliptical nature of Hanna and Michael's relationship. This leaves the principal actors to fill in the gaping holes. In response, Kate Winslet gives a strong, nuanced performance as Hanna, foregoing much of her glamour to track the oblique character over three decades of stoic concealment. German actor David Kross is genuinely affecting as Michael, and he brings the necessary vulnerability and eagerness to make more palatable the controversial sex scenes with Winslet. Ralph Fiennes has the diabolically difficult role of the older, haunted Michael, who must come to terms with his unresolved feelings toward Hanna. He is given precious little latitude to flesh out an obviously pained character.Give credit to Daldry and Hare, however, for attempting to tread a fine morality line in presenting a character whose sense of duty to the Nazis did not end up defining her life. At the same time, they fall short in dramatically connecting her lack of rehabilitation with the broader question of responsibility and culpability for the Holocaust. There are plenty of extras on the 2009 DVD beginning with five separate featurettes. The first is the standard ""making of"" puff piece with the cast and crew discussing the characters and the production, while another is a ten-minute interview with Kross and Daldry about the young actor's casting. Winslet is spotlighted primarily for the make-up and prosthetics she had to don as the aging Hanna. Two shorts focus on Nico Muhly's haunting soundtrack and Brigitte Broch's meticulous production design. The theatrical trailer is also included, although the best extra is a run of deleted scenes, 42 minutes in total, which provide added context for some of the more elliptical turns of the story.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

So I just come here to share my feeling I resented watching movies. Here, like many, I reacted positively but with lot of pain and sadness. Thought provoking? Certainly as this film deals with many facets of our ""humanity"" or the lack of it. The holocaust was such a surreal events that people who live with ordinary reality had trouble to perceive or accept. And the many who somehow were part of the tragedy, save the victims, weren't necessarily evil people as well. ""human"" is such a quality or rather an adjective that can have extreme representation, the good Samaritan or the serial killer with almost everything in between. I personally saw an interesting introduction of this person who dealt with life the best she could but with lot of respect for what she was doing, and this was acknowledged by her peers and superiors at work. Her secrete handicap led her in a different direction although she applied the same integrity. Her logic defied those with higher intellect. The conclusion is well handled and fitting, and the acting all around was brilliant. Well this may already amount to 2 cents so I'll leave it to that.",,Anonymous,Romance
Literacy and other barriers,"THE READER in the form of Bernard Schlink's masterful book made an emotional impact on those who read it. And for once the book to film version holds nearly as much agony and beauty as the original. The screenplay is by David Hare (whose transformation of 'The Hours' was so worthy) and it captures not only the dialogue of Schlink's novel but fills in the silences with well-constructed added commentary. Stephen Daldry ('The Hours', 'Billy Elliot') directs with great sensitivity to not only the narrative story but to the myriad metaphors that fill the quiet spaces in both the novel and the film.Michael Berg (David Kross, a significant discovery!) lives in Berlin, falls ill with Scarlet Fever, and is given shelter from the rain and cold by a stern appearing Hanna (Kate Winslet). When Michael recovers from his illness he returns to Hanna's flat to thank her for her kindness and there begins a strange and beautiful love affair between a virginal shy lad and an older but obviously emotionally flat yet needy woman. Despite Michael's family's disdain for his absences away from home, Michael surrenders himself to the passion of love and Hanna softens as she pleads for Michael to read to her. Reading and sex become exchanges for this rare couple until Hanna disappears. Michael discovers her some ears later when Hanna is on trial for war crimes (she had been a guard in the concentration camps). Hanna allows her guilt to override reality in confessing she had been the one who had written the orders for the extermination of Jews - this despite the fact that Hanna is illiterate, a fact known only to Michael.While Hanna is imprisoned Michael (now Ralph Fiennes) records his reading of books to send to Hanna and during Hanna's twenty years of confinement she learns to read and write because of Michael's efforts and gifts. Once Hanna is scheduled to be released from prison and the prison matron convinces Michael to be in charge of the aging Hanna, the story takes turns and the ending is so gently painful that sharing it would ruin the impact for those who have neither read the book nor seen the film.Winslet, Kross, and Fiennes are excellent in these very difficult roles. Their performances are enhanced with the supporting cast that includes special cameos by Lena Olin and Bruno Ganz and some other fine German actors. The mood of the film is gray except of the isolated moments of bliss Michael and Hanna share and the atmosphere is well balanced by the musical score of Nico Muhly. This is a film worth viewing repeatedly, there are that many layers of meaning to glean from this cinematic triumph. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
David Kross,"Whereas most viewers praise the performances of well-known and appreciated actors, Winslet, Fiennes, the truth is that is the performance of David Kross as Michael that holds the whole picture together and it is mostly through his eyes that we get to know the story. This must have been a huge weight on the shoulders of this young actor but you wouldn't guess it in his fine performance. He is truly the discovery of the year and I find it amazing that his role has largely gone unnoticed. Still, if the film is loved by many, it's due to him as much if not more than the other co-actors. I hope to see more of this fine young actor in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's all in the eyes,"A very good somewhat subtle movie where almost everything is in the unsaid, the subtext and the eyes of the characters. The always sublime Kate Winslet did not get an academy award nomination for nothing. She's bold enough to act without makeup, naked and at different ages. The other actors were fine also (including Ralph Fiennes, excuse the bad pun ;-). I wish it had been more touching for me but it's already great that the character played by Kate Winslet was multidimensional and not unlikeable despite her sins. Lest I forget, besides the ""love"" story element, there is a strong reflexion about morality, guilt and doing what's right. As a former and hopefully future bookseller/librarian, the reading parts of the story were some of the scenes I preferred. It's definitely worth a rental but probably not a purchase as watching it once is probably enough.Rating: 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An unforgettable and moving read,"There is something extremely dangerous about internalizing the shame or embarrassment a person might have. They can act stoic, sure, but eventually what they tried to suppress will come back to them and at that point, it becomes all the more difficult to finally confront those demons when it does. ""The Reader"" shows us just how damaging such secrets can be, not only for the person keeping them, but also to whom they're keeping them from.Its story is told in three distinct parts by Michael, including flashbacks that begin at the time when he was a reserved 15-year old kid, falling ill, being helped by and setting eyes on Hanna for the very first time. Their ensuing romantic relationship is a complex one - enigmatic but endearing, abnormal on paper but validated by the fervent, undeniable lust they show for one another. The conflicting forces of their bond are, in a way, what seemingly draws the two together. Below the surface, however, it would appear that their vulnerability plays an important part in it as well.The film is not unpredictable per se, in that certain elements of the film, like Hanna's feelings towards Michael, are viewed skeptically due to 1. The inherent peculiarity of their situation and 2. Winslet's extraordinarily nuanced demeanour. Our consciousness of the situation allows us to more clearly analyze and understand it and so we are granted the time, amidst their time together, to ponder the psyche of each individual. This element, of its subtext being masked by a rather straightforward situation, makes ""The Reader"" all the more thought-provoking and powerful.The direction and writing also play an integral role in bringing out the humanity of its characters. The shift in tone, beginning with its brevity and high pace, then gradually slipping to a more pensive, poignant feel, effectively divides its story into its own distinct parts but manages to flow seamlessly by the weight of its characters emotions that seem to never relent and so humanely evolve. This is thanks to masterful performances by David Cross, Ralph Fiennes and, of course, Kate Winslet.The story of Hanna Schmitz is reflective, regretful and truly heartbreaking, as we watch her being slowly swept away by the uncompromising ugliness that stems from keeping her own her secrets. Perhaps confessing to her shortcomings may serve as the proverbial key to her freedom, but it is ultimately her shame which has imprisoned her for life. And in that sense, she can never truly be freed, only endure what has irreparably damaged her for so many years.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"daring, thought-provoking, sublime","The Reader is a very ambitious and daring movie, in that it risks being misunderstood, mainly by those who believe solved all the questions concerning the Shoah and can see clearly where guilt and responsibility lie. The movie, like the book, shifts the attention from the universal, great history to a personal, small history, trying to pose further questions, to look at things from a different perspective, but never falling into the temptation to justify or blame anyone or anything. The horror of what the Shoa was is out of doubt, is something the viewer has always in mind, and, given the due proportions between collective and individual tragedy, it just gives voice to those people who became, more or less unconsciously, the instruments of Nazi Germany, people whose consciences were totally destroyed and replaced by an absolute duty to obedience, fundamental to the success of that dreadful system. I would define the movie as sublime, in the romantic sense of the word, in its tension towards a possible definite comprehension of reality, even though no final and absolute truth is to be found. The movie moves gently but inexorably into the harsh story of Hanna, superbly interpreted by an outstanding Kate Winslet, one of the most talented actresses of today, capable of conveying a strange but touching sense of emptiness, sadness and at the same time a passionate longing for life. Her love story with the young boy is experienced with passion but also sadness and pain, the only moments in which she feels authentically human is when she is read the classics, which can lead her into the lives of fictitious characters, but full of pure emotion. Less convincing Fiennes' interpretation, who seems (maybe only apparently), a little detached from those events which should have left a time-resistant mark in his soul. The only flaw is the choice to use the English language, both for the books and for the letters between Hanna and Michael. I think it's quite misleading, since the question of the language is highly significant, in that is strictly connected with the sense of belonging to and identifying with a country and its history. This flaw does not prevent the movie from standing out as milestone within the cinematography urging thought and elaboration of the sense of individual, besides collective guilt, under Nazi Germany.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Reader A Decent Drama With Good Performances,"The Reader is a decent drama with good performances especially from Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, and newcomer David Kross.

He shows some real talent and bravery especially in the nudity/love scenes his character has with Winslet. The rest of the cast are also solid in their limited screen time.

Heart wrenching performance by Kate Winslet,"The story is based in post World War 2 Germany, shown inter-linked in three parts:First part, where a teenage boy Michael Berg (David Kross) falls in LOVE with a young working girl Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winstel) who is double his age.Second, where the boy Michael is a young graduate lawyer and is attending a court seminar where Hanna Schmitz is accused of being a complicit guard at a Nazi prison where 300 people are murdered.Third, where Michael (Ralph Finess) a well established lawyer secretly supports Hanna's 20 year prison sentence and after release when she commits suicide, he fulfills her wish.The first and third part are the most engrossing and entertaining where romance between these two protagonist brims every frame.The main spine of the movie is Hanna's illiteracy that she is ashamed of.During part one - Hanna insist that Michael reads out all story books and novels to her before having sex with her.During part two - Hanna's secretive about her illiteracy during court proceedings lands her in a life-time sentence compared to her other co-guards who only get 2-3 years of jail sentence.In part three - the part one romance of story reading is recreated again when Hanna is in prison - and Michael sends her audio tapes of all the books he had read to her. Through these tapes Hanna learns to read and writes to the extend that she can form a small sentence and send it to Michael. Those scenes are exceptionally executed with tenderness and LOVE. Even a three word sentence of Hanna written to Michael brings tears to our eyes.Michael is shown torn between hating Nazi criminal and his romantic love interest - Hanna.The last scene of Michael and Hanna meeting each other after almost 40 years face to face is extremely heart-breaking.Without saying much Kate personifies her LOVE by screaming through her eyes, body language and hidden emotions that she wants to be with her LOVER Michael who is unwilling to help her beyond a point. This realization leads Hanna to commit suicide.Hanna's character screams at us as audiences for empathy and sympathy and all credit to the master-class performance of Kate Winstel for it - incredibly portrays an Oscar winning role.Apart from these two main characters - other roles are passe.

"A powerful, authentic and compelling drama","First of all, I'm surprised and disappointed by the weak reviews this film received from a significant number of critics. In my opinion, ""The Reader"" was, by a small margin, the best Hollywood film of 2008. ""Milk"", 2008, is also excellent, however, I felt ""The Reader"" was a little more powerful and the entire cast gave exceptionally good acting performances, especially newcomer David Kross, as the young Michael Berg, besides the obvious powerful performance of Kate Winslet, as Hanna Schmitz. I considered ""Frost/Nixon"", ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"", all from 2008, to be very good, but not excellent films. The five films mentioned here were the five nominees for the Best Picture Oscar of 2008. The feel good ""Slumdog Millionaire"" won the Oscar for Best Picture.The story is based on a German novel of 1995, and concerns the remembrance of a long ago summer love affair between a 15 year old boy and a 32 year old woman. This story point apparently was objectionable and distasteful to many critics. I disagree with their perspective. Of course, the behavior of Hanna Schmitz, in the story, is wrong and immoral and could be considered statutory rape. For this offense and the later, more serious offense committed later by Hanna Schmitz, I found myself surprisingly sympathetic to her plight during and after her trial. The story, as depicted in the film, spans 34 years of the life of Hanna Schmitz. ""The Reader"" was shot mostly in Germany, where the original story of the novel takes place. I was impressed with the emotional authenticity, weight and honesty of the film.Director Stephen Daldry, with his stage background, does an excellent job obtaining the best possible performances with all of his actors in the film. Daldry certainly knows how to tell a story with significant and authentic emotional impact. The courtroom trial is dramatically authentic, powerful and emotional. There is some raw sexuality in the summer lover affair and it's done with admirable restraint and grace.Though Kate Winslet has given some very good to excellent acting performances before this film, which include five Oscar nominations, I felt this was her most compelling and powerful acting performance ever, since her feature film debut in ""Heavenly Creatures"", 1994. This performance in ""The Reader"" represents her sixth Oscar nomination, so it was certainly her time to finally win.Winslet has received six Oscar nominations for acting in only 15 years, which is certainly impressive. Most actors and actresses do not even receive a nomination during their entire acting career. Since 2004, it became apparent to me that Winslet was an especially gifted and promising film actress. I have thought of Winslet as ""The Great Kate"", since 2004. With time, I believe it is certainly possible for her to reach Meryl Streep's amazing acting achievement of 16 Oscar nominations. After Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet is the film actress I hold with the highest esteem, respect and admiration.Besides Winslet's great acting performance in ""The Reader"", I was most impressed with newcomer David Kross, as the young Michael Berg. As a native German speaker, he not only mastered the English language, he proves himself very genuine and sensitive with his acting and has an authoritative voice, in this, his third feature film. I will be watching for future film performances of his, as he appears to have a promising acting future.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A changelling and bold film with sensitive scenes and thought-provoking issues,"¨The Reader¨ opens in post-war Germany when teenager Michael Berg (David Kross) becomes ill and is helped home by Hanna (Kate Winslet), a stranger twice his age. Michael recovers from scarlet fever and seeks out Hanna to thank her. The two are quickly drawn into a passionate secret affair. Michael discovers that Hanna loves being read to and their physical relationship deepens. Hanna is enthralled as Michael reads to her from ""Homer's The Odyssey,"" ""Mark Twain's Huck Finn,"" and ""The Lady with the Little Dog."" Despite their intense bond, Hanna mysteriously disappears one day and Michael is left confused and heartbroken. Eight years later, while Michael is a law student observing the Nazi war crime trials, he is stunned to find Hanna back in his life--this time as a defendant in the courtroom. As Hanna's past is revealed, Michael uncovers a deep secret that will impact both of their lives. Many years later, nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, law student Michael Berg in 1966, he is now age 23 and attends Heidelberg Law School. As part of a special seminar taught by Professor Rohl (Bruno Ganz) he goes to a trial and re-encounters his former lover as she defends herself in a war-crime trial. How far would you go to protect a secret?. Unlock the mystery !. Behind the mystery lies a truth that will make you question everything you know !.Stephen Daldry directs the leading couple Kate Winslet and David Kross in The Reader, where the British actress won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress and the Oscar and BAFTA for Best Actress. 'The Reader' is an engaging and brooding story about truth and reconciliation, about how one generation comes to terms with the crimes of another and in which starring Michael will discover a deep secret that will have a great impact on both their lives. The film is faithful to the detail and tenor of Bernard Schlink's 1995 novel, titled ""Der Vorleser"" with adequate script by David Hare, a complex beast in simple clothing. It is a post-Holocaust story, pitching itself between the known of the cataclysm and the unanswerable philosophical questions of its fallout, touching on responsability, justice, law and forgiveness, all the while considering education and literacy as crucial to those debates. Bernard Schlink and Michael Berg are second generation voices,embroiled in first generation issues, adressing a third generation audience. Along with the three protagonists: David Kross, Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, who give very good performances, there is a fine support cast, such as: Bruno Ganz, Lena Olin, Alexandra Maria Lara, Jeanette Hain, Alissa Wilms, Susanne Lothar, Emily Berg, Florian Bartholomäi and Matthias Habich.In this attractive
film the colorful and evocative cinematography by two great cameramen: Chris Menges, Roger Deakins stands out. As well as the sensitive, moving musical score by composer Nico Muhly , including a catching leitmotif. The motion picture was competently directed by stage director Stephen Daldry. He made his film debut in ¨Billy Ellot¨ . Daldry is a good director whose films often contain a character who tries to seek some form of redemption , and his roles usually progress with the help of another character generally focus on female ones , including interpretations honored with an Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role by Nicole Kidman in The Hours (2002) and Kate Winslet in The Reader (2008) . Daldry has directed 6 actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Julie Walters, Nicole Kidman, Ed Harris, Julianne Moore, Kate Winslet, and Max von Sydow. Kidman and Winslet both won Oscars for performances in one of his movies. Rating 'The Reader' : 7.5/10. Well worth watching . Essential and indispensable seeing .",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dont worry about facts when you have romance.,"Deep story with great performance by Kate Winslet, she is believable at each scene. The disappointment comes when her young affair has no way to present evidence he clearly knows and to save the rest of her life. If he felt he was a jilted lover it only brings more injustice and have learned nothing from their german past. Besides this guy with no honor, the Aushwitz camp is only being used, even though it mostly Polish prisoners, the witness is jewish. Why not use the numerous other camps, the jewish one of Berkenau and Plaszow which they mentioned as being ""near Krakow"" just bad history.

The Holocaust in a Different Light,"I was deeply touched by the film's primary message, that, although there were countless evil leaders within the Nazi regime, there were also those misfortunates, like this illiterate woman, who were victims, certainly by their own choice, but more for reasons that point to their own survival.Having no education, however, does not make one unable to feel, as witnessed by this woman's love for literature and for a 16 year old boy, no matter what some might think about her contributing to the delinquency of a minor. After all, how many of us today got our start willingly in our teens? Being illiterate can, and in this case, did, create for Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) limited options for employment. And so she went for whatever door opened to her, not knowing where it would lead.I keep asking myself why Hanna didn't admit to her illiteracy when prompted to show a sample of her handwriting by her prosecutors? Was it embarrassment, or was she willing to be a scapegoat in order to keep the other women guards from a possible death sentence? Was illiteracy, in that day, on the same scale as an unpardonable sin? I saw in ""The Reader"" that one can love another as God loves us, without reservation, no matter our iniquities. Love forgives, and covers a multitude of sins.In this film, however, only the very select reaped what she'd sown.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The Reader is not loud, but has its moments","The entire movie is complex, multi-dimensional and needs time to digest. It's about the consequences of an affair and the underlying sin/guilt of the affair and the past. 33-year-old Hanna Schmitz had an affair with a 15-year-old boy Michael Berg. 10 years after the end of this summer affair, Hanna was trialled for mass-murdering 300 Jews in the concentration camp. Berg witnessed the whole trial, but was ultimately reluctant to meet Hanna personally. The court sentenced Hanna to be imprisoned for the rest of her life, after Hanna confessed her responsibility as a camp guard of sending women to their deaths. When Hanna was in the jail, Berg couldn't let her go in his memory and kept mailing special presents to her......At the very conclusion of the movie, the audiences were able to see the immorality/guilt/sins of Hanna comes partially from her illiteracy. But in the trial, in the very law process which decided the fate of her, it's the consequences of the guilt that mattered. Throughout the movie, Hanna always looked confused and conflicted. In the affair with the ""kid"", aka young Michael, she infected Michael with such confusion and conflict. Lately, in the year 1988, when Michael had returned the tin of money Hanna preserved for the Jew victim who accused her, this flow of confusion had come to a conclusion. The movie can be divided into 2 perspectives, the guilt's and the victim's. Hanna was reviewed by Michael in both perspectives so he had the most mixed and conflicting feeling for Hanna. In some sense, Hanna, the immoral senior woman who seduced Michael into an affair with her, had destroyed Michael's marriage and integrity of family before he had both. So Michael, a victim to her, blamed her for dumping him. On the other side, he sympathized with her in the trial because the trial nonetheless aroused people's hatred against Hanna, who was actually illiterate and shouldn't have been sentenced so harshly. In Hanna's perspective, she took an interest in Michael maybe because Michael was considered an reincarnation of the victims in the camp. She made Michael do the same thing she asked the prisoners to do--to read books for her. Their connection, the reading of the books, had become the only connections again, when Michael began to record the reading of the books he used to read to her. It's actually not hard to understand her suicide in the end, since she doesn't have much to live for, and she couldn't face Michael again. There are of course more than one explanations to all of these, when you consider the movie't not trying to tell a flat story but rather a 3-dimensional one.The movie had a lot of sentimental moments, and tried to discuss the topic about what's the proper criteria of guilt. Should people be prosecuted for real? Does the legalistic system rise people's rage and hatred rather than comforting the victims? It probably took the position that used to belong to The Dark Knight in the best picture Oscar nominations. We can tell this movie is somehow made directly for winning Oscar, so why not give it a chance?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What an outstanding performance.........,"What can say about this film ,this film is an great adaptation of the book The Reader.There's an urgency in human nature to understand. When it comes to the Holocaust, history's bleak, unsettling period, it doesn't matter what book you've read, film you've seen or account you've heard; in the end, your response it halted by its incomprehensible conclusion. How could humanity course its way towards such a violent, destructive path? How could people knowingly send men, women, and children to their impending doom? Most puzzling, how could the world allow it? Even though its been 63 years since the blood-drenched annals of World War II, its aftermath today is still bone chilling.After a six year celluloid dry spell, Stephen Daldry returns to the director's chair in a brilliant, sexually charged, and oddly heartbreaking tale about the complexity of human morality and the lifelong repercussions that result from our actions. Adapted from Bernhard Schlink's best-selling German novel, ""The Reader,"" Daldry's visual translation is a powerful, emotionally absorbing film that is one of the year's best. It's superbly crafted.With World War II over, Germany, in 1958, is still recovering. Deep within Heidelberg, Germany, Michael (David Kross), a young pubescent teenager haven fallen ill, is comforted by Hanna (Kate Winslet), a hard working woman who is twice his age. Taken by her generosity, Michael revisits Hanna to offer his gratitude. What begins as an awkward reunion escalates into a seductive, forbidden affair that intensifies when Michael begins reading to the distant, empty Hanna, who is deeply awakened by Michael's spoken literature. Too young to understand love's complicated implications, Michael is emotionally devastated when Hanna suddenly disappears. Nearly a decade later, unable to forget his passionate summer while studying law, he attends a Nazi trail, and to his dismay, hears Hanna's distant voice.""The Reader"" is a complex film; maybe a little too complex for some. Though the film pertains to Nazism and the ""sins of our fathers,"" in essence, ""The Reader"" is a film that reflects the emotions inside all of us. During a lecture, Michael's professor comments, ""Societies like to think they operate on morality but they don't."" In this cynical age, how far from reality is that statement? During Hanna's trial, she's questioned why she participated in the Nazi party's horrendous war crimes, broken she replies, ""It was my job."" Oddly enough, that seems to be the justification most people use. Surprisingly, though, ""The Reader"" isn't about her exposure as a war criminal, but an exposure on an individual who took the wrong path. She's not a bad person; she's simply made wrong choices. However, when it comes to having involvement in the Nazi's liquidation of the Jews, how ""wrong"" can you get? ""You ask us to think like lawyers,"" cries on student, ""what are we trying to do?"" A distraught Michael replies, ""We are trying to understand!"" But, just who exactly is trying to grasp a deeper understanding: the court or Michael? How can Hanna's past be forgiven? Director Stephen Daldry brings the much needed emotional layer that a character such as Hanna Schmitz desperately needs. Although her actions are beyond unforgivable, strangely, we sympathize with her. Maybe it's her other shameful secret. Maybe it's superb character development.""The Reader"" is a film that is driven by it's raw performances. In one of her finest hours, Kate Winslet gives the performance of a lifetime. It's a haunting and heart-breaking. David Kross, who's only 18, is impressive as the teenager with raging hormones; it's such a daring performance. Winselt and Kross bring this picture together. Their performances are jaw-droppingly brilliant. Completing the role of Michael, as the tortured grown man, is Ralph Fiennes, who balances Michael's despair through his melancholic emotion when he encounters a grown Jewish woman, played by Lena Olin, who was also at Hanna's trail. Although her scenes clock in less than 10 minutes, Olin, too, is breathtaking.When ""The Reader's"" credits rolled, I sat quietly shaken by what I had witnessed. It's a film that is impossible to forget. When a grown Michael asks Hanna, ""Have you spent much time thinking about the past?"" Heartbroken, she replies, ""It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter what I feel. The dead are still dead."" She's right.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

There are some twists that feel a little unnatural, but it does not really bother the already weak script. In this first half, one could think the film intended to revisit the Madison County bridges, but in a different location and time. It results a poor attepmt to me. The ""reader"" shows more bed scenes than actual book reading. And it is cheeeesy.Second half is just another holocaust film, nothing new.

"Only the ""important"" half of the book portrayed appropriately","It is sad to see another book-to-movie conversion gone wrong. Overall this film is certainly okay, but if you've read the book, especially in the original, you will probably be disappointed.Obviously a lot of the director's and cast's attention was caught up with the usual Nazi, World War II and Holocaust themes. Which unfortunately caused them to completely under-portray the more subtle human angle that was the relationship between Hanna and Michael. Especially Kate Winslet's portrayal of a Berlin woman of the time was very, very poor. It is admittedly very hard to accurately portray a typical Berlin character, even more so if one has never lived in the region and even more so without speaking the typical Berlin dialect of German. Unfortunately all these things are necessary to accurately bring alive the character of Hanna Schmitz and the relationship between her and Michael. It is quite apparent that Kate Winslet could never fully get into the character of Hanna Schmitz, which leaves the whole movie with a rather stale aftertaste.The book has a variety of central themes: simple juvenile first love, responsibility in an unbalanced relationship, pride and how to deal with the problems it brings, broad human rights questions and philosophical points both small and big. While the movie attempts to bring out all these nuances, it only succeeds in a few areas, and virtually all of these have already been covered by a great many movies dealing with WWII themes. Why Kate Winslet won an Oscar for her sub-par performance is quite beyond me.Having said that, the rest of the cast are pretty good most of the time, the settings are very accurate and the questions the movie does manage to stir up are important and well done. Overall it remains just slightly above average though.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Winslet headlines a strong film that lacks clear and unified meaning,"There's no denying that ""The Reader"" is a well-crafted film. Director Stephen Daldry (""Billy Elliot,"" ""The Hours"") has proved himself more than capable of handling a struggle as deeply internalized as that of Michael Berg (David Kross), a German teenager in post-WWII Berlin wrestling with the shame of an affair with an older Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet), who herself is wrestling with having been a Nazi. There is no question that despite the film being about guilt and shame and how the characters are affected by bottling it up, that Daldry is able to successfully communicate the story, its emotions and keep it visually interesting (though Winslet is the true master of this skill). Yet somehow, ""The Reader"" doesn't manage to drive any kind of message home. It drives home three or four instead of clearly focusing on one.Ironically, a character at the end of the film suggests to an older Michael (Ralph Fiennes) that if he's seeking catharsis he should turn to the movies. Well, not this one, at least. It's really hard to pinpoint what this film is about. Is it about a scandalous love affair and its implications? Is it about the guilt that is never absolved when one commits crimes of genocide? It's even hard to tell who the film is about because Winslet is as powerful of an actress as there is when it comes to commanding the inner monologue that she'll have you convinced the movie is about her even when--from a bare bones perspective--it's really about Michael, or at the least their relationship.There's just too much for the viewer to reconcile in ""The Reader."" Between overtones of suggesting we should feel sympathy for a Nazi and understanding why older Michael is being so emotional about Hanna decades after they were last intimate, there's no room for clarity. While you can certainly feel captivated by Winslet's facial expressions portraying a heavy clash of guilt and shame, that doesn't help you better understand why her ex-lover is struggling emotionally to get through law school. It might not seem right to say it, but Winslet is so good that she becomes more a part of the film than perhaps she was intended to be.Audiences will like ""The Reader"" for its parts, but not the sum of them. Each subplot, each essential question, gets addressed in some way by Daldry and writer David Hare, but the main idea, the message as a whole, is unclear. There are so many satisfying bits and pieces, scenes, symbols and imagery that appear particularly artistic and poignant, that there's something for everyone viewer to connect to, but together they feel almost meaningless.Because of the thematic identity crisis, there are some structural issues with the film as well. While the producers wanted you to know about Schmitz's dark past, the film ignores the fact that you know for the first 45 minutes or so. It begins telling the story chronologically from the day Michael and Hanna met but then ends up shifting more frequently. These different 'time zones' don't exactly succeed well on their own either, they're all a part of the greater story, which as we know, is not entirely clear.""The Reader"" is an example of why Winslet is every bit deserving of the acclaim she receives and of how you can take something seemingly unfilmable and give it visual life and make it interesting. In a year as full of remarkable films as 2008, it's simply hard for ""The Reader"" to stand out, especially with some flaws that keep it from being a deeply meaningful film in addition to a well-made one.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

This movie is full of clichés, it's almost unbearable. The dialogues are unnatural. The story is powerful, but the way it's told is an offence. What a pity! The first 20 mins of the film are already a warning. Why do the two main characters develop a relationship? It seems totally theatrical, unbelievable. Where does the kid's fascination come from? The woman is a stranger to us, we never get to know her, her character is so erratic and inconsistent: one day she is sweet and sensitive, another day she is a rude bitch. Then the grown up man, who is he in reality? We get a glimpse on his family problems, but are they relevant to the story? In a more technical ground, the film is slow and redundant. OK, the kid is reading to the woman. We don't need to listen to him reading for hours to understand the concept and its impact on the characters. OK, they have good sex. We don't need to see them doing it all the time to get it!! And then OK, he is reading again. And again we are forced to listen to him for endless minutes! I was terribly disappointed by this movie.

A Good Conflicting Story,"The movie represents a duality between the present and past life of Michael Berg (played by David Kross and Ralph Fiennes), and his troubled relationship with Hanna Schmitz (played by the award winning actress: Kate Winslet).The movie's ""mood"" could be divided in two emotions, the viewer might feel thoughout the film as the story progresses. And that's good, because suddenly there's a clear division between the parts, generating conflict and interest to the viewers, who were pretty much already uninterested but the excessive nudity it contains (not exaggerating, the first scene has nudity).Young Michael's actor and Hanna's, played a huge part in the movie, with good acting, that even got Kate Winslet the Oscar's for it.The fact it's played in post-war Germany isn't unimportant, as it directly influences the characters journey. (Want to know what happened? Whatch it.With some flaws, of course, the movie deserves some credit, and I recommend it.

Reads into a Strong Ending,"Director Stephen Daldry and writer David Hare have one of the greatest chemistry's of any writer-director I've witnessed. Going back to their ambitious effort, The Hours which would fail to win any other Oscar outside of Nicole Kidman's staggering performance. However, The Reader, their newest efforts have proved to be much lighter and even less impressive of works of 2008.The film stars a wonderful ensemble of actors; starting with the beautiful Kate Winslet in her most ""bare,"" to say the least we've seen her in her career, who gives a valiant effort portraying Hanna, the woman with a dark past and even darker future. Winslet's performance here, while not surpassing her work in Revolutionary Road earlier this year, should see herself as an Oscar nominee this upcoming season.David Kross who plays Michael, the object of Hanna's affection at fifteen years old, is solid and gives a courageous breakthrough performance which should make him one to watch in later years.Ralph Fiennes, as the elder Michael is utterly heartbreaking. Making us aware of how great he has been in the past and still continues to wow us in his later years, he really shows versatility here. We hope he doesn't remain one of Oscars best kept secrets who continues to go unnoticed through time. Lena Olin, in a brief, yet strikingly igniting role, does what she can in such minimal time.David Hare's screenplay however, doesn't provide enough character depth to hold us to the story. All are pretty much a mystery and undeniably in agony but we really don't care why. Daldry's direction holds pace but takes a while to pick up steam. The last third of the film is where it really comes alive but the journey there is quite uneventful.Collectively, The Reader is a solid work yet noticeably flawed but always worth the watch.***/****",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

An Outstanding Movie,"What an amazing movie. Starts off almost as a boring movie with an affair between a 15 year old and a woman twice his age. A lot of adult content has been thrown in.Just when one wonders where all this is heading, comes the major twist in the plot. It really shakes you up. But if there is something that defines this movie, it is the subtle handling of a very complex historical theme. It attempts to slightly humanise the other side where the lowest rung were following orders. No judgements passed either on the affair or the Auschwitz's killings. The facts are laid out before you and you almost flow with the tide of emotions that well up within and are torn between the plight of the victims ( an unforgivable crime) and atleast one character who doesn't understand that what she did was wrong. .
The questions asked in the movie will vary for each one of us depending on our value system. Some of these could be
Is it possible to continue to love someone who has been found guilty of heinous crimes against humanity.Whether a crime is a crime in a moral sense or as interpreted by the laws of the land prevailing at that time. Or the winners are free to frame laws with retrospective effect.And the eternal question of the Nuremberg trials where the plea that the killers were merely following orders received from their top bosses was not accepted

The film suggests these questions repeatedly. So much so, that ultimately you cannot help pondering bigger questions, more troubling questions. Powerful stuff!

"Passionate, thoughtful and moving, but there was a problem...","I enjoyed ""The Reader"". I did. I thought it was a good film. A passionate, thoughtful and moving piece of work about guilt, shame and the secrets that can blight a life. In the first half Kate Winslet and David Kross carried the film, and both were very good, but when Ralph Fiennes took centre stage, ""The Reader"" became outstanding. ""The Reader"" was a solid and quality piece of work.My problem? Er... Well, the nudity. Kate's copious nakedness was really kind of distracting and ""The Reader"" didn't need it. In fact, I would go as far as to say that it took something away from the power of the movie. Perhaps the filmmakers thought they had to demonstrate, in a blatant and provocative way, the passion and the intensity of the affair between the older woman and the younger boy? I don't know. I just felt that the explicitness was draining and a little bit unnecessary.Come on guys (and gals)! There are other ways to shoot love scenes. You can concentrate on the legs, the arms, the back, the lips, the feet, the face. Especially the face. You don't need to show everything.I am not a prude. If Kate Winslet still wants to take her clothes off on screen, then that is just great. In fact, it is fantastic! More power to her elbow. At 33 she is still a fine looking woman.

Funny out takes at the end?,"Was it just me, or were other people hoping for some funny out takes at the end of the movie? With all the sex scenes between the boy and Kate Winslet, there had to be some funny moments when shooting? :-)If someone gave you the ""elevator pitch"" on the plot of this movie, I think the typical person would roll their eyes (at least a little). I'm giving it six stars because the film was beautifully shot, set, and caste, but the real purpose of the movie was to ""build"" an Oscar worthy movie. Unfortunately, the endeavor failed miserably.On the other hand, if I was dating a new girl and hadn't had sex with her yet, I would definitely take her to see this movie!

Moral Dilemma,"The problem with any movie trying to deal with the holocaust is that it draws comparisons to Schindler's List. I like this film because it challenges the viewer to make sense of pieces of a puzzle that are never put together to explain exactly what happened, but there are very clear clues that young Michael Berg, played very effectively by Davis Kross fails in his duty while still being faithful to the woman he knows Hannah to be. Kate Winslett provides the necessary mystery to as a complex a character as one is likely to see in film. If I have a complaint it is that the talents of Ralph Fiennes are a bit underused here, although I can't think of how it could have been done better. The pace of the film might be off-putting to some, but for me, it added to the portrayal of psychological pain that is at the center of the story.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Very good, but no Masterpiece","The Reader is a great adaptation of the amazing novel. The screenplay is of the highest caliber. It revolves around everything the novel focuses on, and it gives these characters some dimension and force. Of course, the main performances here are spectacular. David Kross is very realistic, and although at times he felt awkward to me, I think he still managed to make all of his expressions be fitting and work with his character. The tour-de-force here is Kate Winslet. What is possibly her best year, giving an amazing leading performance in her other brilliant film,Revolutionary Road, here she plays her character of a different caliber that she has never done before. Her acting is certainly of the highest rank, and she deserves all the recognition. Ralph Fiennes, a great actor, managed to pull it off very well too. We feel for him, playing the older Michael. The film has some amazing cinematography, costumes, set designs, and amazing make-up. It does come with it's flaws though. I felt that some of the small actors were not up well for their writing. They were not bad, no, but maybe too bland. The music score was brilliant, but I thought at scenes it was way too loud, and went on for too long. But of course, the highs of the film bring everything to another level. Quite brilliant film",,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: The Reader,"After the recent Golden Globes, I'm sure many were scratching their heads why Kate Winslet was put up for a Supporting Actress award, because if she's not the lead actress in The Reader, then I don't know who is.Based on the book by Bernhard Schlink and adapted for the screen by David Hare, The Reader tells of the sexual relationship between a boy and his older lover during a summer in post WWII Germany that had been kept under wraps, and the aftermath of that relationship after some trying circumstances involving sudden departures, unexpected reunions, and worse of all, denial because of confusion in wanting to do what's right.Directed by Stephen Daldry, The Reader tells the story of Michael Berg (played by David Kross and Ralph Fiennes as the older man) and his sexual awakening under the tutelage of Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet with an accent), a tram conductor whom he met one day when he was sick. Soon after he's back at her place more frequently like a horny schoolkid given a head start in sex education, who thought that his reading to her the classics of works from Charles Dickens to D.H. Lawrence was kinky foreplay. Rated R21 for full frontal nudity (male included) and what have yous, but it's all quite tastefully done without the need to gratuitously exploit the scenes.The first half dealt more with the physical nature of Michael and Hanna's relationship which slowly transforms to an emotional one, albeit peppered with issues because of their obvious age gap, and for her, in being a cradle snatcher. We know little of her past as well, which will be revealed in due course, but so long as it's not made known to her lover, their tiffs (as with all couples) become more pronounced and reconciliation becoming more difficult as well. She disappears one day, leaving Michael heartbroken, and it's not until much later during a trial that he finally learns more of her. Not an ideal situation of course, as it presents a chock load of questions to which there are no clear answers.Kate Winslet deserves her awards thus far for her portrayal of a woman hiding what she deems as a shameful secret, and it's not about her romance with Michael at that. She gives her Hanna an air of innocence despite the severe crime against humanity in which she was implicated, all because to her it was a job, and has to be done right, and duties discharged professionally. Winslet brings through her exasperation really well, and slowly we see her steely resolve and innovation in correcting her deficiency. The make up department also deserve credit for their work on her, and adds an extra dimension to her performance.Ralph Fiennes on the other hand has limited screen time here as the older Michael Berg, but managed to add gravitas by linking both past and present together. His role is to carry the sense of guilt over, as well as to seek some redemption and forgiveness of his past. His short scene opposite Lena Olin wrapped that up quite nicely. David Kross naturally steals the show as the protagonist, who in his youthful exuberance and defiance at first deemed his relationship under wraps to be perfectly novel, until like Adam's biting of the forbidden fruit, he finds himself surrounded by controversy that he's unable to handle, and a tinge of shame that his promising future will be on the rocks should his illicit affair be made known.Kross had shown this change of attitude perfectly. From that innocence of a wide eyed boy toward getting to the candy shop every day, preferring to forgo hanging out with his immature peers for the arms of a mature woman, to discovering that growing up also meant change, and wistfully wanting to be back with his peers. He doesn't know whether to do the right thing, or weighing the consequences, prefer to keep mum, deny, and let another go through persecution alone. His failure to understand and grasp his reading to Hannah, and worse, that act being associated in what was deemed to be a heinous crime, seemed to all condemn his silence even further. While Ralph Fiennes had that excellent scene opposite Lena Olin, here David Kross has plenty opposite Bruno Ganz who plays his law lecturer.You know that Oscar season is here when movies like these start to make a beeline for release dates from now until February. The Reader is recommended for its well thought story, as well as its wonderful cast to bring to life a tale of romance, guilt and redemption.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Hard Lines,"A hard beauty. A joy to behold. Unadorned, utilitarian, purposeful. Cold as steel, and maintaining a firm line constantly. What man could resist? Yes those 1950s trams were things of great wonder.Kate Winslett was OK too, but my problem is that I always find Kate's characters slightly annoying. Unfortunately, I feel the same about Ralph Fiennes. And believe it or not, Bruno Ganz as a Robin Williamsesque university lecture , and Lena Olin as the Manhattan based gallery something-or-other, (who ARE these people?), surpassed them both. Ganz in particular. Shudder.The film itself I felt started slowly with no real meat to the cold romance depicted.

Solidly made but overrated and disappointing,"The novel upon which ""The Reader"" is based is a highly acclaimed and much loved piece, particularly in Germany. It deals with German national guilt about Nazism and it is a book which, by all accounts, is a clear, well-defined and gripping piece that has something to say and says it well. This makes it all the more surprising that the film adaptation is so confused.It is not just a confused piece, but a disappointing one as well, particularly as it is solidly made. It is very well shot and beautifully scored and there isn't, technically, much wrong with it. It is also pretty well acted, though this is not one of Kate Winselt's finer performances and the Oscars have nominated her for the wrong film (when compared with far more interesting performance in ""Revolutionary Road""). There is a particularly strong turn from Bruno Ganz, as a Law professor.However, the film simply doesn't amount to anything. You never really care for the characters as you have no time to connect with them before they begin to have a wail of a time. The plot meanders, ponderously, through many years and becomes increasingly dull. And, through it all, you're never sure that the film knows what it wants to be.Is it a Holocaust drama? Not entirely. Is it about German war guilt? Not entirely. Is it about the triumph over illiteracy? Quite probably, as most of the film appears to be about this. There are elements of all of these, but as the two hours of well-put-together, decently-acted drama plays out, the film, as a whole, doesn't really develop. It is as solid as you would like it to be, but thoroughly, thoroughly disappointing.3 Stars out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Well-done about the struggle of post-war Germans dealing with their history,"It's set from 1958 to 1995 primarily in Berlin and Heidelberg, Germany. It follows the impact of a teenage boy's affair with an older woman on his life, especially after he learns she was a guard at an extermination camp during World War II.Michael Berg (David Kross/Ralph Fiennes) is a 15-year-old schoolboy who by happenstance encounters a 36-year-old streetcar conductor, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet). She seduces him and they have an affair for some months. Suddenly, she disappears without explanation. However, the relationship impacts Michael for the rest of his life.Eight years later, Michael is in law school in Heidelberg. One of his professors (Bruno Ganz), a Jewish survivor, takes his small seminar to see a trial of former SS guards accused of responsibility for the deaths of 300 women. Michael is shocked to see that Hanna is one of the women on trial.The film gradually reveals why Hanna disappeared in 1958, why she accepts responsibility in 1966, and how Michael copes (or not) with this knowledge about his former lover. His struggle with how to relate to women, and to Hanna following 1966 is the core of the plot.This is well-done about the struggle of post-war Germans to deal with what transpired in their country during the war. At the same time, we see Hanna's humanity despite her psychological denial of her role in the war. Kate Winslet and David Kross are superb. Ralph Fiennes is more one-dimensional. For me, the literacy angle of the film is a symbol of German blindness.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just what are we being told here?,"The Holocaust is such a huge subject in every sense that it's not surprising that there have been so many films examining the experience from so many varied angles. By one authoritative reckoning, there have been nearly 300 such cinematic works and some - such ""Sophie's Choice"" and ""Schindler's List"" - have been truly memorable and moving. However, ""The Reader"" is an addition to the genre that it is hard to welcome.Directed by Stephen Daldry (""The Hours""), technically it is superb. The acting is fine with an outstanding performance by Kate Winslet as Hanna, a former concentration camp guard who betrays no understanding, let alone guilt, for her actions both at Auschwitz and at a fire and yet shows kindness in assisting a young man in the grip of scarlet fever who becomes the reader of the story (David Kross as the youth and Ralph Fiennes as the man). The make-up and cinematography are first class.The problem is the narrative, which jumps backwards and forwards between 1958, 1966 and 1984, based on a bestselling German novel by Bernard Schlink. Things might be clearer in the book but, in the film, the motivations of the leading characters are utterly opaque and the central message of the work is totally unclear, leaving this viewer anyway perplexed and unsatisfied with a story which seems morally confusing if not vacuous.",,Anonymous,Romance
"An excellent story, where each viewer judges for himself what he is seeing.","I was impressed with this film. It is truly memorable. The story begins with young Michael, a German boy in his teens. He meets Hannah, a tram ticket collector somewhat older than himself, and is attracted to her. Later, they both start a very intense love affair, which marks the discovery of sexuality for Michael. The case lasted only one summer, but it impressively marked him: years later, already as a law student, he will find Hannah in a difficult situation, when she is accused of several heinous crimes related to Nazism.This film has an excellent script. The story of love and physical desire between the main characters may shock some people by their age difference, but I confess that I didn't feel uncomfortable with that. Hannah's permanently grumpy and rude attitude bothered me a lot more. The way in which the film approaches various situations that are morally debatable in a neutral way does not seem negative to me, it ends up allowing each viewer to think for himself about it. I also think that the psychology of Hannah has not been fully explored. There is so much about her that the film does not reveal, so much that we wanted to know... I feel that this is intentional, due to the way it involves the character in a tasty and charming mystery. Another thing that caught my attention was the nudity. The sex scenes are sometimes quite visual, although always short... it was not something that shocked me or that I really considered a problem, but some parents should consider it before leaving teenagers to see this movie.In addition to an attractive script, the film features good actors. Kate Winslet is the big star of the film and, really, is in excellent shape and gives us a superb interpretation. She deserved, in fact, the Oscar for Best Actress that she won with this work. The very young David Kross showed that it is a promise of European cinema with an intense performance of a shy, withdrawn and sometimes naive young man, and Ralph Fiennes did not disappoint us in the mature version of this character, offering us with an elegant and restrained work. The cast also has a good work by Bruno Ganz.Technically, it is a discreet film that does not bring anything new, despite doing what has to be done with professionalism. Cinematography is the standard, but it makes good use of the filming locations, also knowing how to play with shadows: in fact it is a cloudy film, and the Sun, like joy, rarely appears (as in the bicycle trip that the two central characters, at the height of their happiness, do it together). The sets are good and the costumes and props were chosen in order to recreate, with caution, the periods that the film is going through (from the 50s to the 90s). The soundtrack is good, but I confess that I didn't find it memorable.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A forbidden love, the right love","The Reader, directed by Stephen Daldry, is an emotionally charged and thought-provoking film that explores the complexities of love, guilt, and moral ambiguity. At its core is the unlikely and deeply nuanced romance between a teenage boy, Michael Berg (played by David Kross as young Michael and Ralph Fiennes as the adult Michael), and an older woman, Hanna Schmitz (played by Kate Winslet). Their relationship, which begins in post-World War II Germany, evolves over the course of several decades, filled with passion, regret, and long-buried secrets.The film spans a timeline from 1965 to 1995, reflecting both the personal growth of Michael and the shifting political and social landscapes in Germany. Through the lens of Michael's first love, The Reader delves deeply into the emotional intricacies of coming-of-age, particularly the raw and unfiltered emotions that arise when a young man becomes infatuated with a much older and mysterious woman. David Kross delivers a stunning portrayal of Michael's youthful enthusiasm, naivety, and the intoxicating whirlwind of emotions that accompany his passionate affair with Hanna. This first love is all-consuming for Michael, and Daldry masterfully captures the overwhelming sense of exhilaration and confusion that such an intense relationship can bring.The chemistry between Kross and Kate Winslet is palpable, and Winslet's performance is nothing short of captivating. She brings a deep sense of vulnerability and complexity to Hanna, a woman who is difficult to fully understand, yet impossible to ignore. Winslet's portrayal of Hanna earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress, and it is easy to see why. Hanna's character oscillates between being tender and distant, which creates a sense of emotional tension that carries the film forward. The audience, much like Michael, is left to grapple with Hanna's choices and her role in a much darker chapter of history.One of the film's greatest strengths is the way it juxtaposes Michael's emotional journey with Hanna against the backdrop of historical events. The relationship between Michael and Hanna is more than just a coming-of-age romance; it also serves as a vehicle for exploring themes of shame, guilt, and the legacy of the Holocaust. As Michael matures and becomes a law student, he discovers Hanna's involvement in war crimes during the Nazi regime, which forces him to confront the ethical dilemmas of loving someone who is morally compromised. This revelation alters the course of Michael's life, and the film grapples with the weight of their shared past, as well as the broader implications of forgiveness and accountability.The film takes viewers through a rollercoaster of emotions. From the initial stages of infatuation, where Michael experiences the thrill, anxiety, and passion of his first love, to the devastation and disillusionment that follows once Hanna's past comes to light. The emotional highs and lows are palpable, and I found myself feeling a wide array of emotions-love, devastation, fear, and ultimately, pity. The relationship between Michael and Hanna is layered with both beauty and tragedy, and even though their bond is fractured by painful truths, there remains an undercurrent of affection and care between them, a flame that never fully extinguishes, no matter how turbulent the years become.In a sense, the film feels like a modern-day fairy tale wrapped in a grim reality. Michael's youthful love for Hanna initially feels like an escape from the world, an intimate secret shared between the two of them. Yet, as their lives become entangled with the weight of history and personal responsibility, that fairy tale is upended. There is no prince charming here, and Hanna, far from being a damsel in distress, is a woman with dark secrets that Michael cannot ignore. The emotional stakes are high, and Daldry successfully conveys this tension through masterful storytelling.A critical element of the film's emotional depth comes from the score, which is beautifully woven throughout the narrative. The music, composed by Nico Muhly, perfectly complements the film's tone, enhancing the viewer's emotional journey. Every note is meticulously placed, ensuring that the score amplifies rather than overshadows the film's more delicate moments. Whether it is the gentle strains during Michael and Hanna's intimate scenes or the more somber, reflective melodies that accompany the film's darker turns, the music never misses a beat. It works in harmony with the storytelling, guiding the audience's emotions in subtle yet powerful ways.Ultimately, The Reader is much more than just a love story-it is a meditation on human frailty, redemption, and the moral complexities of life. The performances from the cast are outstanding, with Ralph Fiennes delivering a nuanced and restrained portrayal of the older Michael, haunted by the decisions of his youth and the consequences of Hanna's actions. The dynamic between the two actors who play Michael at different stages of life is seamless, creating a cohesive character arc that is both tragic and thought-provoking.Stephen Daldry succeeds in crafting a film that lingers long after the credits roll. The Reader invites viewers to reflect on the nature of guilt, love, and the burdens of history. It is a film that challenges us to question whether love can truly exist without understanding, and whether we can ever fully reconcile with the past.Overall, The Reader is a haunting and captivating film that held my attention from start to finish. It is a rich, emotional experience, filled with depth and nuance. While it is not an easy watch, it is a rewarding one, offering audiences much to contemplate. I'd give it a solid 8 out of 10 for its compelling performances, strong direction, and the sheer emotional weight it carries.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two persons' story which never becomes equal.,"This is a work with the history, life and death, a very heavy theme. I think about how I compensate for the mistake that has been repeated in the history. German Nazis party is the keyword of this.It is an elaborated story that this movie is splendid. It is the relationship of a man and a woman ―their name is Michael and Hannah― if I say in detail. They surely love, but always pass each other; and are not equal relations. If their relationship included the top and a bottom, two people met you; Hannah is the top at first. Michael is a student learning a law, and Hannah is an older woman working by rail of the cities. But, in fact, Hannah does not understand a letter, and the position relations with him who learns both the Greek and the Latin reverse. They meet again in a court. She is the person is judged.

Great story but...,"I found it fascinating. But I have problems with the morality play here. I understand that the Holocaust was horrible but the woman in this movie portrayed by Kate Winslet is someone caught up in the horror of German dominance. Michael Berg on the other hand, has free will in his actions and his choices are utterly contemptible and repugnant. He's actually worse then the woman he so freely judges. The movie is riveting but has such a sadness that it borders on depressing.

Strong Start Weak Finish,"Kate Winslet won an Academy Award for this performance and she deserved it. The woman she plays is everything at once. Brutal, heartless, cruel, seductive, vulnerable, tender, despairing and lonely yet absolutely above all self-pity.So that's great. But the problem is that the first third of the story, where Hanna seduces the young hero, has a completely different tone from the last two thirds of the movie. All the slow, gloomy courtroom scenes, the moral dilemmas that keep hitting the viewer over the head, just come across as leaden and uninspired. Really the whole movie should have been the love affair and then there could have been a brief post script explaining who she really was and how the boy dealt with it as an adult.This movie was trying to be Schindler's List but ended up being the Last Picture Show.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An engrossing film with an amazing performance from Kate Winslet,"Okay, I'll admit it; Kate Winslet is my favorite actress of this generation. So, I might be a bit biased towards her, but I try not to be. Yes, she is incredibly beautiful, but she is also incredibly talented. She becomes the characters she portrays. I believed her as hopelessly romantic Marianne in ""Sense and Sensibility"", as insane Ophelia in ""Hamlet"", as quirky Clementine in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". Now I believe her as cold yet passionate Hanna Schmitz, an older woman that has an affair with a much younger man while hiding dark secrets from him. Watching the film I believe Winslet is German, and I also believe she is capable of the crimes she is accused of in the film. She is sharp and cold in her encounters with other people, yet we still can sense warmth hidden inside. Winslet is absolutely brilliant in her portrayal and she finally won an Oscar for it. (She was nominated 5 times before her win, further proof of her abilities.) But I don't want to take away anything from the other actors. Ralph Fiennes is great as the older Michael, but it's David Kross that hold his own against Winslet. His portrayal of both the innocent and maturing Michael is truly great.I've read some reviews that complain that this is just another Oscar baiting Holocaust movie. I'll agree that it does lack some of the emotional punch that other films had that year, perhaps this was something that was lost in the translation from the original book. But to discount this as just another Holocaust movie is not fair; it is a movie that poses complex questions about ourselves and about our secrets. We all have them and often we go out of our way to keep them. Do we hide them so that we can belong? Or do we hide them out of pure shame? In the film one character keeps a secret that hurts another, the other character keeps a secret that hurts them self. Why? And why did I care so much for someone that was so cruel? These are some interesting questions and the film left me wondering about human nature and why we do the things we do and feel the way we feel. I can always appreciate a film that makes me ponder such things.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""  You think you upset me?  You don't matter enough to upset me!  ""","Somewhere in the dark, amid the wet streets of Berlin, this story arose. It was originally written by Bernhard Schlink, screen played by David Hare and later directed in a motion picture by Stephen Daldry. The story is of a young teenage boy named Michael Berg (David Kross) who is smitten by Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) an older neighbor and seduced into an assignation. Though their affair is the basis for their initial contact, Michael comes to enjoy the pleasant company of the older woman who introduces him to youthful physical pleasure, but also to the mysterious side of a woman with a secret. It is this secret which the adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes) must contend with. His older life revolves around their early companionship, one which ties them inexorably to the future. The forward and backward motion of the story is difficult to come to grips with, but eventually the audience snares the essence of message. Mr. Fiennes is superb as Michael and comes to realize there is so much hatred between the races, it could easily keep theme apart for eternity.

OK story but with...,"a bunch of unnecessary nudity thrown in for publicity. I think Kate Winslett's nude scenes were to help advertise the Reader. Her young lover, Michael, also shows off too. But aside from that, this movie is OK but nothing great. Winslett is Hana Schmitz, an older woman that falls for a 15 year old and begins an affair. She has him read her lots of books since she is hiding her illiteracy. The first part of the film is about the affair; the second part is about Hana's trial. She is on trial with others for being a nazi guard and letting her prisoners burn in a church. An older Michael is now in law school and is attending her trial. He wants to say something when Hana's illiteracy could help her case, but doesn't. Hana gets a life sentence.The make up and aging of Hana is very good.

Thought provoking!,"The Plot: A teenage boy finds himself in a (sexual) relation with an older woman. Part of their relation is based on the boy reading to the older woman. However one day the woman disappears, leaving the teenage boy heartbroken.Several years later he finds her again as he witnesses (as a spectator) her trial where she is charged for war crimes.As society passes moral judgement over the woman, so does he. Whether he is right or wrong in doing so is left to the viewer to decide, the movie merely shows us what happens given the choices the characters made.The acting: Although I don't think anyone could've acted any better than Kate Winslet in this movie, speaking English with a German accent to portray Germans is very disappointing. However, the characters don't speak out every emotion they are experiencing (unlike most US of A movies) which challenges the viewer to think for themselves, is it love, fear, sense of duty, hate, misunderstanding, shame (and i could go on) that motivates the characters actions? Very difficult to pull off, but all actors pull this off magnificently. They force you to look at the complexities of a human being and (rightfully so) deny you the easy way out by simply putting people in 'good' or ' bad' categories and be done with it. (Note: see those reviews that think bad of this movie? Written by people who love doing this and find themselves confronted with their own shallow mind, better to disregard the movie then!)To sum it up, a very nice thought provoking movie about morals and love.

Two, couldn't the older Michael in 1988 be more sensitive to a lonely Hanna who's about to be released after spending 22 years in prison?Kate Winslet's performance is splendid with effective support from David Kross and Ralph Fiennes. She's able to project her character as a former SS guard disturbed by her past and trying to make amends for the wrongs she might have done although she seemed convinced that she was simply performing her duty. As the younger Michael Berg, Jack Kross comes across as a person who's battling his own demons.This film will make you think days after you watched it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Subtle and restrained, holding a little too much back; amazing performance from Winslet","There's no doubt about it  where American drama film-making is often very in your face, obvious and insistent, British film-making is far closer to the European faction in its elegant, delicate subtlety. The Reader is one such example of this impeccable English film-making, and benefits from the best England has to offer: Director Stephen Daldry, who was a long-time theatre director before moving to motion pictures recently, and who has previously directed two excellent films  the under-appreciated underdog story Billy Elliot, and the even more underrated cinematic masterpiece that is The Hours; screenwriter Sir David Hare, also a long-time theatre professional, in this case a playwright; Roger Deakins, who is one of if not the best cinematographer working today; and at least two of the best acting talents Britain has to offer, Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes. Literally nothing in the film is blunt: ideas and themes in David Hare's screenplay are very subdued and under-the-radar, the acting is not bombastic and melodramatic but rather restrained and calculated, the cinematography serves its purpose but for the most part doesn't particularly stand out (Deakins, who won an Oscar nomination for his work on the film, should have been nominated for either of the other two films he shot this year, Revolutionary Road or Doubt), and in all, I actually felt that it was this subtlety and restraint that really held the source material back from true greatness.That said, the film does contain many elements that come together marvelously, starting out from the screenplay. Like another excellent script from 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Reader's almost extreme and radical subtlety dictates that none of its rich, resonant, powerful themes burst out of its seams, but rather remain bubbling right under the surface. Many critical viewers unfortunately interpret this gentle, restrained subtlety and nuance as ""lack of content"" and ""emotional coldness"", but I actually felt that this was one of the film's greatest assets. From a distance, it may seem to the simple-minded that the film is about the Holocaust and the horrors that occurred in it, but that couldn't be further from the point. As evident in a very short and easy-to-miss scene near the beginning of the film, the true underlying message of the movie is about the dark nature of secrets, and the fact that sometimes, in order to keep secret something that we are ashamed of, we end up doing far more atrocious things than those that we are trying to hide. This message can easily be applicable to the Holocaust, in that because of the German people's shame that they let an atrocity of this magnitude happen on their watch, they didn't do anything to stop it in time. Then again, the message could also be applied on a personal, human level as well, and it is this universality that lends it even more weight and relevance.In addition to the inherently rich screenplay, the film is also carried and elevated by its performances. At the center, and also rightfully attracting the most attention, is Kate Winslet's simply riveting, intricate and quietly heartbreaking performance. It's one of the finest acting moments of her undeniably illustrious career  Winslet is my favourite actress of all time and I don't think she has ever delivered a bad or even a mediocre performance; that said, this is definitely one of her shining moments, and aside from sporting an excellent German accent, Winslet demonstrates an incredible ability to embody her character, who is so caught up in her own shame, both for things she had no say in but also for atrocities that she participated in by choice that she has become a closed shell, hiding all of her feelings behind a pale sheet of glass, although she lets just enough of them seep through her eyes to give us a hint of what's bottled up inside. It is easily one of the best performances of the year. Also worth mentioning are the two actors portraying the young and old versions of the protagonist Michael Berg, David Kross (young) and Ralph Fiennes (old), both of who deliver stellar performances for entirely different reasons. Kross is wonderful in showing the transition from the youthful, lively, passionate Kross to the jaded, introverted and emotionally distant Kross, emotionally damaged by his unrequited love for Winslet's character, Hannah Schmitz, who one day just disappeared after their whirlwind affair one Summer. And Ralph Fiennes is remarkable in his portrayal of the older version of Berg, by now completely world-weary, isolated from everyone around him and emotionally cold and dysfunctional. It is another one of Fiennes' immaculately subtle performances that, although thoroughly excellent goes completely unnoticed by awards circles.The Reader is a good film, but not a great one. It's subtlety and restraint both in its screenplay and in its performances is terrific, but ultimately I felt that the film may have held too much back, keeping us not quite riveted by the plot or characters, as intricate as they are, but rather more objectively but distantly interested. Although a definite beneficiary from excellent performances, in particular Kate Winslet's enthralling, haunting portrayal, The Reader is also somewhat lacking in its more technical aspects, and while a good, entertaining and interesting film, I can think of at least five other films from 2008 more worthy of the coveted Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards than The Reader.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

In fact, Michael offers compensation to those Jewish, but also exposes himself emotionally in front of her, without vulgarity, and reveals her decades later about his relationship with past Nazi guard, and a tear almost mutate from his eye. He implicitly admits guilt, even though he did not know the past when he fell in love with Anna , even though he left her twenty years in prison without the visit, but refused so he will grant a Jewish Yom Kippur, nothing can erase the guilt of the ""Holocaust""! She refuses to receive the compensation funds because this may suggest that the story of the ""Holocaust"" is over, and her house in the film suggests a degree of affluence originally, but Michael is obliged to provide financial compensation in any case, so he is looking for a Jewish organization provided her ...

The Reader,"David Kross is really effective in this tale of a young boy (""Michael"") who encounters ""Hanna"" (Kate Winslet) as he shelters in her doorway from a rainstorm. In fairly short order, this fifteen year old boy becomes her lover; in return she gets him to read to her. He is soon infatuated and devastated when he turns up at her apartment one day to find her gone. Skip on thirty years or so and he - now Ralph Fiennes - takes over a retrospective of her story as we discover she was tried for being a particularly nasty Nazi prison camp guard and she is sentenced to life imprisonment. Throughout her internment, the two continued to correspond - he would send her tapes to aid in her learning to read... Stephen Daldry has created a delicate masterpiece here, I think. Winslet is very much on form as the story goes from a bit of sexual fantasy for the young man, through to a far darker, more horrific, second part. There is something unnervingly natural about Winslet's performance; from the playful and generous - though temperamental - lover for this naive young boy, then the odious and distinctly unrepentant, almost belligerent, woman at her trial. Despite that, somehow, Daldry manages to elicit just a grain of sympathy for her. Was she inherently bad or just inherently weak - or both? Did she crave for affection just as much as the young ""Michael"" did when they met? His story is one of emotional barren-ness growing up in a large family where his relationship with his father was distant and chilly and the young Kross really does shine in the role. There is plenty of sex at the beginning, but it's not gratuitous; it's exploratory - for both of them and that intimacy also adds richness to what is ultimately quite a sad tale that, though thought-provoking when it comes to the whole concept of forgiveness and reconciliation, did make me realise that so many people caught up in the Nazi machine were ill-educated and frightened. It's also worth noting the subtle role played by Bruno Ganz as his legal professor ""Rohl"". This is a character who proves to be a crucial conduit for the young man as he has to come to terms with what he thought she was, and what he now knows she became. The pace of this production is measured, the photography frequently intimate and lingering and the attention to the detail from the production designer also adds potency to this visceral and touching story that I really did find well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Worth Seeing for the Kate Winslet Oscar Victory,"This is one of those times where I'm kind of at a loss for words (or as much as I can be). I don't know what it was specifically, but I can't seem to put a finger on why this movie had no effect on me. It has all the right elements for stirring things up emotionally: a forbidden love affair, dark secrets, the Holocaust...and yet for the most of the film, I remained relatively detached.The Reader tells the story of a summer love affair between Michael Berg, a high school student and Hanna Schmitz, a woman twice his age who works as a tram conductor in Neustadt, Germany. Throughout the affair, Hanna requests that Michael to read aloud to her and mesmerized by his current circumstance, he willingly obliges. Then one day he arrives at her apartment to find it empty and Hanna gone without a word.Eight years later, Michael is attending the Nazi War Crimes Trials as a law student and is floored as Hanna has re-entered his life as a defendant in the case (the theatrical previews show this so I'm not giving anything away).There are some great conversations between the students and their professor in regards to the difference between guilt according to the law and guilt according to morality and David Kross does an exceptional job conveying the mangled and conflicted heartache seeing her in this revealing light, but I'm beginning to realize that my problem was ultimately with Hanna's character. Maybe I wasn't invested enough in their relationship or maybe it was the way Hanna was written, but I just could not wrap my head around it. She comes off like a genuinely clueless simpleton during the trial but in earlier scenes she is fierce, manipulative and strong.A couple of the tag-lines for the film are ""Unlock the mystery"" and ""How far would you go to keep a secret?"" I didn't feel that the mystery was too...well...mysterious and I didn't believe, as a plot device, it really held the weight that brought these two worlds crashing down.This role earned Kate Winslet her sixth Academy Award nomination. A friend of mine was confused as to why she was nominated for The Reader instead of Revolutionary Road, but I have a feeling that in order to prevent a split in the votes and potentially missing a nomination in the Best Actress category altogether, she submitted herself for only one role.I love her and think she should already have an Oscar in the bag from previous roles, but it would be hypocritical of me to say that anybody should win based on a body of work. I know people feel differently and I don't think they're wrong. It's just my belief that each year should be a clean slate and you should be awarded that year for the specific role you are nominated for. I think the Oscars should be like any sporting event: One team against the other and the outcome is based on the performance during that specific match-up despite a winning or losing record.However, the Oscars are determined by a group of people and not by goals, touchdowns, runs, or three-pointers. If Kate Winslet does win, even though this wasn't my favorite role of hers by far, my human side will be thrilled... even if my critical side will still be at a bit of a loss.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I resisted watching this film, but I was wrong","I'm not a fan of holocaust films and I suspected this was one. But in fact this is more en exploration of the reality of having to make your way through a war. And though the young male lead (David Kross)is especially flawless, Kate Winslet is even more luminous and unforgettable. For me, Ms. Winslet epitomizes what an actress should be far more boldly than, say, Meryl Streep. She seems to crave exploring other persona to the point she can authentically speak for them. What's more, there's something oddly disarming about the way she so easily goes nude in many of her movies. She might as well be chiding the rest of us for our utter lack of courage.I would fault this film with being a little long on its intimate scenes for my taste though I'm not sure it would work otherwise. But this film for me is head and shoulders above others I've seen covering the same subject matter. It makes you think more clearly about what it must have meant to be a Nazi, working for the camps, and though I can imagine there will be people who think this is some kind of apologia for those who worked in the death camps, I would argue this merely highlights their own lack of compassion.Ralph Fiennes role is a difficult one and I'm not sure he fully conquers it, but he certainly isn't very far from making it real. Try to imagine what could have been done to make his performance better. I can't think of a single thing.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Oscar-Köder,"A terse, uneven and rather beige bit of Oscar-tickling here with some beautiful location stuff, and sturdy but very understated performances from all hands. Despite the plethora of German places and supporting actors, and despite it being very much encouraged by the author and funded by the government there - it still feels very uncanny valley with everyone British here doing their best silly accents. Especially given the semi-allegorical nature of the story, wrenching it away from Deutschland feels wrong somehow. Still, the late Bruno Ganz does a good turn and it has an admirably grey ethical ambiguity that you rarely see in awards-season fodder but it fails to leave any real lasting impression.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

An emotionally compelling exploration of post-war Germany,"Spearheaded by forceful performances, The Reader is a very well-crafted historical drama that succeeds in portraying a story that is provided by very challenging source material, as an incredibly intimate relationship is used to explore the moral and emotional issues that arose in the scope of the Holocaust and its aftermath. Kate Winslet is simply outstanding in her role, and one cannot say enough about the quality of her acting, particularly due to the fact that the character she portrays is very unsympathetic and distant. Interestingly enough, the Holocaust is not placed in the forefront, but is rather maintained as a constant backdrop to the story, which makes for an extremely powerful and riveting viewing experience. The Reader is therefore the type of film that proves very gripping as it takes its audience on an emotional journey, one that has even greater resonance due to its main subject being Germany's postwar guilt.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Slow in building up,, but very after a few moments in","The movie starts and builds itself so very slowly that feels very strange. Also there's the awkward focus transitions between the young and older Michael and also between Michael and Hanna from time to time. But the movie really sets itself up well after a few moments in with those intimate shots. The characters, especially the main characters, are revealed very well by peeling their layers one by one. I like how the movie emphasizes on the characters' flaws, especially their hypocrisy, innocence and their reactions to ordeals, their own or of others they know. The acting overall is a great job indeed. Kate Winslet really depicted the character very nicely. We can really see all Hanna's angles, from her wild adventures with Michael, her firmness to him, but also her powerlessness which she hides from him. David Kross nicely depicted the innocence of a youngster who gradually changes into someone wiser. Ralph Fiennes did also a great job in imparting the emotions on the reading recording scenes and depicting the older Michael's doubts and reluctance toward Hanna.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Reader-How Wrong Can You Be?,"'Have you been spending a lot of time thinking about the past?' the man asked the woman. 'You mean with you?' 'No, no...I didn't mean to me.'

'I wasn't sure you've learned...' 'I've learned,Kid, I've learned to read.'......................'How wrong can you be?' I think this must be an outcry inside the heart of the man the moment Hanna gave him such a ridiculous answer after so many years of her being a prisoner.When man finally sat and faced in the front of Hann with whom he had an affair when he was fifteen-year old, he sincerely expected the woman could realize how wrong she was in the past, (maybe in this way he could give her a chance to excuse her) but the woman's cold and ridiculous answer made him disappointed again.He loved the part of woman who ever helped him and gave him such a wonderful feeling that summer while he couldn't forgive the part of woman who left him coldly and helped Nazi kill three hundred people's lives.Indeed, there are some people in this world that used to estimating themselves in their own imaginary way. They couldn't face their true face just like Hanna would like to committee a crime she didn't make rather than confess that she was an illiteracy.That summer, the boy was being left alone and heart-broken while Hanna didn't realize what she left behind was the best thing in the world but turned to the wrongest thing in her life.

One of the most touching and thought-provoking films of all times,"'The Reader'(2008) is undoubtedly one of the most touching and thought-provoking films made on the Holocaust in particular and the World War II in general. Though the tempo of the film is indeed rather slow, nevertheless it is entirely gripping and forces the discerning viewer to think and realize yet again that life is usually not black-and-white, rather always grey. The film is basically meant for a mature and thinking audience....one that has an eye and a mind for cinema on serious / controversial subjects such as the Holocaust and how the post-war generation of young Germans are still coming to terms with their troublesome past.The performances by all the cast are perfect for their respective roles, even that of Ralph Fiennes, whose role has, in my opinion, been rather unfairly derided by some. The stand-out acting performances are delivered by Kate Winslet (who won a richly deserved 'Best Actress in a Leading Role' Oscar in Feb 2009, for her role of ""Hannah Schmitz"" in this film)and the young prodigy,David Kross (brilliant uninhibited portrayal of an adolescent boy who falls in love with a woman in her 30s and later learns about and has to somehow come to terms with her notorious past).Indeed the duo have given it their all. So brilliant is Kate's performance (at her trial and onwards in the film)that it is difficult not to sympathize with her and make a genuine attempt to also understand her defence of her past actions, especially the circumstances under which she did what she had to do as a part of her official duties as an SS female guard in a Nazi concentration camp. The background musical score by Nico Muhly is brilliant and just right for the grim and sombre mood of the film.Overall 'The Reader' is a brilliant,sensitive and highly thought- provoking film....full of pathos and tragedy,....a film that boldly dares to challenge conventional notions about the Holocaust without overtly defending its perpetrators / taking sides. The Director leaves it to the judgement of the audience to decide for themselves. One of the ""must watch"" movies for those who value and understand quality cinema purely for its story,performances and direction...not just for gizmos and special effects and to watch certain over-hyped ""stars"".",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A beautiful, yet flawed curiosity","THE READER is a film that is going to perplex many audiences. The reason for this is that is has many of the ingredients that make a film great, and many will see the film as a great success because of these. But unfortunately, the film also misses the mark in a few areas and many film goers will not be able to look pass them. I was stuck in between these views... that is why it has taken almost two days for me to get this review out.What really struck me off the bat was how great the film looks. Roger Deakins always works wonders behind the camera, but there was something about the look of this film that was just so lush and captivating. There's no doubt that it's Oscar nomination for cinematography is completely justified. Next, direction. Daldry, with just two other films under his belt has gained quite the reputation (with 3 Oscar nominations under his belt), and that is because he has a great sense of realism and the ability to make the audience feel apart of his character's world. Those abilities are put to great effect in THE READER. There is not a moment that doesn't feel completely authentic. Also adding the the sense of immersion are a wealth of very fine performances, by heavy-weights (Winslet, Fiennes) and relatively unknowns. I'm pretty sure that Kate Winslet will take home the Best Actress Oscar this year, but I feel that it is NOT her finest performance and there were better performances from other female leads (Melissa Leo in FROZEN RIVER and Sally Hawkins who failed to obtain Oscar recognition for HAPPY GO LUCKY).While the film has it's undeniable strong points, THE READER also has some unforgivable flaws that damper the film as a whole. Frankly, it's one of the colder films of recent memory. For such an intimate portrait of these characters, I was shocked at how little I cared about any of them. Even Winslett, the heart of the picture, I had little feeling or sympathy for. For a drama of this caliber, the lack of emotional connection was beyond disappointing. But perhaps the biggest flaw was how generic it all felt. Throughout, I was just constantly reminded of different, and often better, films. I don't know why, but there was so much familiar with the plot and the setting that I couldn't help but be reminded of such films. I know it has been stated to the point of insanity, but THE READER is the definition of Oscar Bait (especially in the case of Winslett, who will once again prove excessive nudity = Oscars). What also didn't help matters was that after a strong start, the film just seemed to get more tedious and boring as it proceeded, to which I began to car less and less (The film at just over two hours rushes through it's plot, sometimes leaving the viewer confused and in a state of ""why do I even care."" The film does build to a strong third act though).I may sound like I'm ragging on the film, but I'm most definitely not. It's just that in the time after my viewing of it, the flaws have seem to become more apparent then before; and that's always frustrating.For all it's stunning cinematography and visual grandeur, there's an uneasy sense of ""I've seen this all before;"" For all of the films great performances, I wondered why I didn't care about their characters more; For it's strong direction, I wondered why the film couldn't flow at a more comprehensive pace.This brings me to the conclusion that in THE READER, most every positive aspect comes with a negative one. This is a shame because the talent on display could have given light to a great film. Instead, the final product is more of a deeply flawed curiosity that some will love and some will hate. A few however will be stuck in the middle like I am. I find that worse than the two extremes.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

All you have to do is be related to a person who grew up in that era or be their offspring. These people were raised to be polite even if it meant at the expense of truth. It must have been a holdover from the Victorian Era but most of the people who were young during the war and some even after lived quietly with constant pain. Over and above all else one must only show a good face/appearance. Never have scenes in public. I can completely understand why Hanna and Michael could only constantly think of weakness as looking for the truth. I cannot however forgive Michael for not letting the court know Hanna was illiterate. But, that is human nature folks!

Cold hearted,"This is a very cold movie and dangerously close to a hollow and fake one, like the typical Oscar fare. My problem with it is that it is very difficult to sympathize with either one of the two main characters and the other players are just shadows moving in the background.Much was written about the early sex scenes, which are beautifully lit and bring to mind soft-porn movies rather than anything linked with the holocaust. Because of the way the story is presented - a torrid affair between a boy and an older woman - everything that happens afterward tastes fake. Sure, there are some pretty serious questions hanging around - German guilt, personal choices, etc... - but eventually it all boils down to a couple of unpleasant, cold-hearted people who do not care much about others and little about themselves.Hanna is a little bit more believable as a character, as the uneducated, brutal creature who just obeys orders and does not think about the past or consequences. The boy Michael is a stereotype of the cold German, and on top of that, his actions are totally illogical. First he is supposed to be in love with Hanna, but does nothing to help her (due to German guilt I guess, but still unforgivable, especially coming from somebody who chose law as his profession). Then, after many years he is again ""nice"" to her, but refuses any direct contact and finally, when it is conveniently too late, he decides to come clean and confess.Of course people behave in illogical and inconsistent ways, but I found his behavior really too much of a mess. Kate Winslet as Hanna is good, but again, this role is possibly the most unsympathetic, distasteful and ambiguous she ever played. I'd rather see a good comedy any time than a pretentious, made-for-the-Oscar movie like this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"a captivating, well-made story","The setting is Berlin in 1995: Michael Berg, a coldly introverted lawyer who's never open with anyone, recalls his youth when as a teenager in 1950s West Germany (the aftermath of WWII still fresh in the minds of many) he crossed paths with an older woman who became his lover, but it's not until years later that he discovers she was a former SS guard at Auschwitz. As an adult, he has yet to fully come to terms with the affair and how it drastically affected the trajectory of his life. Sensual, atmospheric drama vividly captures the mood and essence of a specific time period, and packs an emotional wallop with the expectedly haunting revelations of the Holocaust, along with fully realized characters whose morally ambiguous actions shake them to their very core. Absorbing and thought-provoking, with (not surprisingly) fantastic work from Winslet, a riveting and complex performance from Fiennes, and a remarkable, praiseworthy showcase for Kross who comfortably holds his own as the young, naïve version of the same character. ***",,Anonymous,Romance
A must-see,"When I first heard of this film I thought it was just one more good film because the lead actress had won the Oscar. I was wrong! In the beginning I found the film a little boring story of an older woman falling in love with a young man but as the film unveils it becomes more and more interesting revealing a tragic ending and a never to be forgotten story. The first third of the movie is of a very sexual nature. Hanna and Michael's affair occurred in the summer of 1958, abruptly ending when Hanna left the city. The setting then fast forwards to 1966 when Michael was attending law school. ""The Reader"" is a good film that also makes us think a little more about the consequences of our attitudes in this life. Excellent acting by Kate Winslet and a deserved Oscar.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Uneven film, great performances","'The Reader' tantalizes us with a premise so sultry, so sensuous. Stephen Daldry, who also directed 'The Hours', brings this tale of Nazi accountability to life with the help of a tremendously talented cast. But as the heat of passion wears off, so does the spark that made 'The Reader' such a captivating picture.'The Reader' nearly achieves greatness during its first hour. It's seductive, sexy. Kate Winslet and David Kross bear all to deliver remarkable and worthy performances. While Winslet is no stranger to stripping down for the camera, David Kross' role as a teenager coming-of-age while living in West Germany during the 1950s is admirably brave. The relationship between these two is captured beautifully on film with human passion during a difficult time of reconstruction and national shame. The film is focused, rapturing.But as 'The Reader' moves away from its sultry premise, the driving force behind the picture falters. It never ceases to be a fascinating story, but it lacks that emotional punch that would have helped make this a truly memorable experience. It feels rushed, and was in order to be out in time for Oscar consideration. And what was a provocative coming-of-age portrait becomes an interesting but dull look at Holocaust accountability. It suggests an emotionally resonant life story, but in reality 'The Reader' is rather distant. I'm not quite sure what it was getting at, a dilemma that may have risen when translating the source novel from the screen. But I'm not convinced that had Winslet's Hanna been literate, her actions would have been any different. Is it redemption for the awful crimes committed?The emotional toll that 'The Reader' takes on David Kross' character is obvious. He becomes a heavy smoker, he's forced to watch the trial and humiliation of a woman he thought he knew. Kate Winslet's physical appearance undergoes dramatic changes. The sensuous, lustful body gives way to age. These are two devastatingly human performances, and that makes the difference. 'The Reader' may struggle when it tries to become a profound and meaningful excursion, but the riveting performances of these fine actors is terrific. See it for them. But if you're looking for a more convincing and tragic look at Post-WWII Germany, you may want to look elsewhere.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie is based on a hidden love affair during the world war two.,"First of all, this great movie is again a great collective work of Stephen Daldry (Director) and David Hare (scriptwriter). Their gorgeous previous work was The Hours. As it happens in the hours, this movie again drifts the viewers into the mystic world of books and book reading. today the accelerated world we are living in do not recommend the old style habits. Both of the movies illuminate the illiterate viewers. Secondly, movie approaches to the Nazism in a very different way. Nazism and second world war is a very cliché subject for the Hollywood. Over and over again we have memorized the same story. This movie really deconstruct memorizations. Thirdly, ""The Reader"" brings out an extra ordinary love story. A love story that starts as ""taking advantage of each other"" and ends with a passion.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thought provoking for sure,"Many a times in the movie you are not sure what you are seeing, what are you feeling about what you're seeing yet you are hooked to go along with it. That's the quality of the film that stands out. Looking at how different people have different things to say and take out of the movie, can say the movie manages to achieve the rare feat of keeping things open ended yet not render it uninteresting. And there are so many layers to explore that you can sit and keep thinking about them long after the movie ends. Ebert hits upon an interesting idea that the movie is equally also about the man's guilt because he cared more about hiding his shame than saving her but I am more in line with the interpretation that the man was a survivor of abuse and the movie in the latter stages traces a very delicate position he finds himself in. And god, the holocaust and the culpability layer - I need to do some serious history reading to have some grasp there. And finally, one more thing that would be interesting to think about is why did Hanna do what she did at the end. I know many at that point would think, ""yea, makes sense"" and move on. But I kinda wanna think that the Fiennes character had something to do with it!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best delivered Oscar in the last years!,"First let me start by saying that Kate Winslet was the best delivered and most deserved Oscar of the last years! OK, I'm exaggerating, every year the great actresses win their deserved awards... but God I'm surprised, happy, proud and delighted with Kate Winslet's performance... Jesus Christ, that woman is amazing! I also have to say that Slumdog Millionaire is, in my opinion, the most overrated movie of the last years... and this time I'm serious... the movie is good... very good actually... but it's not THAAAAAAAAT good as the Academy made it sound! It's overrated... The Reader is FAR better for example.Alright... enough with the bla-bla-bla and focus on the movie! Kate Winslet is (as you all understood already) amazing! Probably the role of her life! David Kross is equally great. He is the surprise of the movie! 18 years old and acting with no fears like a Pro! I gotta say ""Congratulations"" because he is really good! He is a very big promise as a future actor... I hope people realise that and don't him get away! I sure would love to see him again in a big movie! Ralph Fiennes... I honestly don't know what to say... He is a great actor, no doubt about it... but he barely appears in this movie... that's why I think David Kross should have been more talked about... Sure, Ralph Fiennes is the big star, not David, but he barely appears so... you know what I mean! Long story short... this movie is FANTASTIC!! Great actors, great plot, great direction, great production and it has an essential thing.... the SURPRISE ELEMENT! Great everything... more Academy Awards would have been TITALLY deserved! You're gonna cry from the beginning 'till the end... I know I cried... A LOT!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
No cacaphony in cartharsis,"I did not see this movie in the theaters, so the actors and sounds did not grab my attention immediately, but once they did, and they did, this movie became the most wonderful exhibit of studies in catharsis, which I have ever seen. Though I did not suspect duplicity in catharsis as I moved through each scene, by the end of the movie it was clear to me that the writer(s)intention was to culminate the movie with the strongest of the expiations, the opening to the closed doors of the psyche. I don't want to be specific for fear of spoiling it for others, but Kate deserved the Oscar, and I liked this film much better than Slumdog Millionaire, but I wouldn't go so far as to say the Reader should have won the Oscar. SM was a good film, one that deserved recognition, a film that could grab your attention in almost any setting. I suggest that if you find yourself in the mood to curl up with a good book, it is the perfect setting to watch the DVD. Kate as Hanna is amazing, strict to our perception of the more logically oriented women of the Deutschland. It is surprising to see what delights this woman in this role, and that is to KW's credit. There may be one disturbing scene with a stark reminder of Nazi atrocity so you are warned. If the mere hearing of any discussion of the Nazi prison camps bothers you, you are once again warned.However, if there is some slumbering guilt deep beneath the surface of your heart, which sometimes emerges to knock at the door, this movie may motivate you to open that door. If we open that door, we may be better off for it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pointless needless propaganda,"I nominate THE READER for the inaugural Leni Riefenstahl Award for Excellence in Propaganda.To begin, author Bernhard Schlink wanted to examine what it means to love someone who committed an atrocity. He could have set his tragic love affair against any moral crisis he wanted, but his choice of the war crimes trial of five female Nazi prison guards places both his novel and the movie in the category of zionist propaganda. The great propaganda moment comes near the end when the crime in question is revealed at the trial. Two points are of particular note.LAW VS. MORALITYBased on their written account of the event, the women are charged with failing to open the locked door of a building during a fire, thereby causing the death of 300 women and children prisoners trapped inside—all save one woman and her daughter.A law professor, who brought five students to see the trial, explains that what the women did was legal according to the law at the time. Student Michael Berg rejects this sanguine attitude: ""You keep telling us to think like lawyers but they are guilty... What is there to understand?"" Berg is meant to represent the voice of humanity and righteous indignation. For him, what the women did was a crime because they were morally responsible for the lives of the prisoners and they failed in their responsibility. Legalistic tap-dancing around what was or was not acceptable cannot make the crime any less punishable. For this scene—and the film itself— to have integrity, the position of moral righteousness must remain constant. It doesn't.Because The Reader came out during Israel's bombardment of Gaza one month ago the entire trial is rendered banal. The professor is absolutely correct: there is nothing surprising or condemnatory about what the women did because the same corrupt morality that made it legally acceptable then is again acceptable now.During the bombardment of Gaza, Israel forced 110 Palestinians, half of them children, to take shelter in a house in Zeitun, a suburb of Gaza City. The next day Israel deliberately bombarded the house for 34 hours, killing 30 and wounding 18. The youngest victim was five months old. There is no trial scheduled to try these war criminals.In fact, the Jews who committed the Zeitun atrocity were greater criminals. The guards did not actually attack the building. Theirs was a crime of omission; Israel's is a crime of commission.The only reason to make this movie, much less write the book, is to breathe life into Hitler's ghost so we don't notice the living Hitlers in Israel. The guards in The Reader were not put on trial for allowing innocent people to die; they were tried for allowing Jews to die. The effect is to propagandize the Jew-as-victim myth and make the audience believe that it's a political reality.COLLECTIVE GUILTThe second propaganda point is the common theme of all Germans sharing responsibility for the holocaust. One of the law students says of Hanna Schmitz, one of the guards: ""I'd shoot her myself; I'd shoot them all."" In contrast, fellow student Michael Berg is downcast throughout the trial because Hanna is his former lover, and he knows she is innocent because she is illiterate. She could not have written the incriminating report as the other defendants claimed.Against the lies of the other guards, though, Hanna would not defend herself for fear of admitting her handicap. Berg, who could have saved Hanna, did not speak up because he feared his classmates' contempt, and he wanted to distance himself from the crime.The audience is shown both bloodlust and cowardice, yet they are supposed to identify with the professor's detached, rational respect for the law: ""If people like you don't learn from people like me, then what the hell is the point of anything?"" Indeed, what IS the point"" The idea that justice for these Nazi guards should be fair and rational is hard to take seriously given that Jews in Israel are visiting a collective punishment, a holocaust, on Palestinians, and many Jews are sabotaging attempts to bring the criminals to justice. Moreover, if one accepts that Israel is a law unto itself and commits collective punishment as a matter of national policy, could the professor's rational detachment be invoked in the defence of any Israeli war criminal that might face trial? Regardless of how much attention one pays to the relationship between Michael and Hanna, the holocaust is the focus. Without it, there would be no book or movie. The holocaust defines for all time our moral frame of reference: the past is real; the present is an illusion; Jews are eternal victims.The legalistic culture and the oppressor/victim relationship described in The Reader are antiquated, so the decision to use them, in preference to meaningful, real-life, examples renders the book and movie preposterous, manipulative and dishonest.For the above-mentioned reasons and the high quality of the movie's production, The Reader would be a worthy recipient of the inaugural Leni Riefenstahl Award for Excellence in Propaganda.excerpted from ""Hollywood's most misunderstood genre deserves its own award category"" (http://www.gregfelton.com/movies/2009_02_15.htm)",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Reader is disappointing.,"This film is very disappointing. Kate Winslet doesn't normally do bad films, but here she has stained her perfect record. The idea was good but the film was bad. Ralph Fiennes is over acted, he has gone downhill since his days in ""The English Patient"".Stephen Daldry used to direct excellent films (The Hours, Billy Elliot) but now there is a stain in his perfect record too. I found this film at times boring and slow. In general, this film is an example of good talent wasted.I think it isn't worth paying for it at the cinema or in a video-club, if you are curious to see a bad film download it.

A passionate and steamy love affair that last in memory even when times of guilt and the arrival of truth is discovered.,"""The Reader"" is without a doubt an emotional love story that spans thru time and memory as it shows how it can affect and shape the life of one young man. This type of film may not be everyone's cup of tea, yet I for one found it's themes of love, along with the hot and sexy steamy love making scenes, rounding out with the trial after war time that arrives at painful guilt and truth discovery to be compelling and interesting, as ""The Reader"" is just the type of film to draw the complete attention of a viewer. To add to that the performance of Kate Winslet the lead lady of the film is portrayed to perfection as her role of an older lady who's clearly a seducer is a real treasure to watch.""The Reader"" which was based on a novel is set in postwar Germany and it chronicles the life of one Michael Berg(Ralph Finnes)from the tender age of 15 till his life up in the mid 1990's. Starting with Michael being ill he meets Hanna Schmitz(Kate Winslet)one day as after Michael is helped home and upon his recovery he again journeys back to see Hanna. Yet he will discover that Hanna is twice his age, yet despite his tender age of 15 Michael is drawn into a very hot and steamy passionate love affair with her(I must say the love scenes were well done and Kate shows plenty of skin). Michael being a schoolboy and Hanna who works as a train ticket conductor keep their physical romance a secret, yet Michael discovers Hanna has one passion and that is she loves for him to read stories and poetry to her(Oddly enough Hanna herself is illiterate)and this skillful fun only deepens their passion for one another. Then the film shifts one day as Hanna leaves causing Michael to be heartbroken.Eight years later while Michael is a law student observing the Nazi war crime trials, he will make a surprising discovery as sitting in the courtroom back in his life is Hanna who's on trial as a defendant for war crimes. Hanna does not defend herself even though she feels she done nothing wrong you as the viewer really wonder about it if she feels any guilt or not. As it goes on Michael's feelings of the past become more and more intense as memories of love and passion never die even in hard and harsh times of guilt and regret.Really this film was well directed and paced by Stephen Daldry as it really is a haunting epic about how even the truth and guilt intersects with love proving memories can stand time from generation to generation even though it's impacted by war crimes. Overall ""The Reader"" is clearly a watch in my opinion for the messages and themes it sends out like love, passion, coming of age, regret, and most of all proving that everyone has memories and that nothing can stop anyone from remembering good times like passionate love even though it didn't last. Also with the performance from Kate Winslet the film is even much more memorable for her bold and brave performance as her characters risk taking style was one to be remembered.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ponderous,"This film has a slow and ponderous style that might lead to accusations of being a typical Holocaust drama.

"""The Reader"" is a sensitive film about controversial topics, in addition to the guilt that surrounds the Germans after the end of World War II","Inspired by the homonymous novel, by Bernhard Schlink, the feature film begins in Germany undergoing post-war reconstruction. Michael Berg (played, as a young man, by David Kross, and as an adult by Ralph Fiennes, with little screen time) is a 15-year-old student, member of a traditionally stoic German family, full of virtues and moral values. On the tram, on the way home, he feels sick, jumps off the tram and is helped by an unknown woman who takes him home. There, a disease is diagnosed that keeps Michael at home for three months. Once this seclusion is over, he decides to thank the woman who helped him: Hanna Schmidt, a character in her 30s, played by Kate Winslet. In a short time, they begin a romance where there is an exchange of both sides and initiations: Michael's sexual, and Hanna's literary, since Michael read to her in the meetings, due to the initially undisclosed fact of her inability to read. The romance lasts the summer and, always very reclusive and even lasts, Hana only asks him for one thing before sex, that he read to her. Hence the title of the book and film. When - without warning - she disappears without leaving a trace, the boy suffers and matures. Years pass and now he is a law student. Guided by one of his professors, he and his colleagues will follow the process of former SS officers who are being tried for the death of Jewish prisoners. And feelings he thought were in the past come back to haunt him.At first, the film is promising, without shame and exposure of numerous issues. The film was not afraid to use nudity in the couple's dialogues as part of the script. Kate Winslet is competent as usual, but it is a pity that in a film without great impact, especially as in the work in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)"", she did not take the statuette. The use of a German accent (even speaking in English) and the creation of a confusing and unpredictable personality for Hanna was worthy of her ability. However, more than the romance between the two, the work tries to show the public what it was like to be born in Germany after the Second World War, all the ethical discussions that come from that time and the traumas as well. In the case of our story, the question is: should Michael intervene in the case and testify on Hana's behalf? But there is still another question: is not being quiet during the trial being as conniving as were the Germans who knew what the black smoke was coming out of the concentration camps and did nothing?Structured in three parts, the narrative develops in the midst of Michael's maturation process. His youth dominates almost the entire novel, but the reflections of adulthood are what punctuate the majority. A first-person narrator, The Reader reflects Germany's past and does not develop its analysis in a Manichean scheme. Hanna had a civic duty to fulfill. Was there another option? Could it go against the ideological scheme of the period? Was what she did wrong? Probably yes, but instead of turning her into a monster, the novel humanizes her, revealing some characteristics of her complex psychological background.Schlink, jurist professor at the Humboldt University in Berlin, reveals to the public a discussion that permeates several areas of human knowledge, in a work translated into more than thirty languages and taken to the cinema by the talented Stephen Daldry, with Ralph Fiennes and Kate Winslet the duo protagonist. Full of chronological analepses, the novel narrated in the first person also delicately deals with the issue of illiteracy. The work also stands out for its intertextual relations. The first work to be re-read by Michael is Homer's Odyssey, a work that talks precisely about one of the themes of the novel: the return. The readings in the work function as a kind of movement towards the past, in the incessant search and seemingly endless task of understanding the lived history. The relationships with Homeric poetry, in this case, appear as quite significant details. The reading/writing process carried out by Michael resembled the narrative journey of Odysseus, the hero whose return does not prevent the adventure from continuing, even if still in the form of a story. ""The Reader"" is very reminiscent of Tolstoy's Resurrection. In the Russian novel, a male character also meets a woman from the past in a trial. Burdened by the feeling of guilt for the unfair situation to which they are subjected as spectators and witnesses, the protagonists of both works seek, to a certain extent, to accomplish something that leads to the unfolding of the situations in question.The performances are the great asset of the work. Young German actor David Kross builds Michael as a boy who, at first, can hardly believe his luck when he meets a seasoned, beautiful woman who gives herself to him without reservation. Becoming visibly surer of himself over time, he still cannot get rid of his old emotional fragility, allowing his lack of affection to transform Hanna into an extremely important figure in his life and submitting himself, with that, to a inevitable heartbreak. In this way, when we meet Michael again as a university student, we immediately understand the origin of his introspective and solitary temperament, which, consequently, proves to be fundamental for us to also identify with his adult version (Fiennes).Meanwhile, Kate Winslet creates a completely different figure from the well-groomed April from Rolling Stone - and just the brutal contrast between these two characters embodied in the same year is enough to reinforce the actress' position as one of the best of her generation. . Giving herself as usual to the role, Winslet abandons the glamor by appearing with unshaven armpits and by establishing Hanna as an ignorant woman who uses sex as the main form of communication with her young and educated lover (and as has become commonplace) in her career, the actress does not show any restriction to appear naked on the scene, which is fundamental to establish the deep physical intimacy between the two characters). Yet it is the wretched woman's secret that makes her so psychologically fascinating-and I don't mean her Nazi past, but rather her shame about a particular handicap. Interestingly, when confronted with her old crime, Hanna does not hesitate to use the classic justification of having followed orders - which, in her case, does not seem just an excuse to exempt herself from responsibility, but rather an absolute, unshakable and shocking to have acted in the right way (not morally, but professionally). By the way, by not realizing the seriousness of the consequences of her ""zeal"" as a jailer precisely because of her lack of intellectual baggage, Hanna reveals herself - in the eyes of Michael and the spectator - as a creature simultaneously worthy of revulsion and pity.And this goes directly back to the immense sense of guilt of the German people in the post-war period. Thus, the postwar trials simultaneously served as both a purge of this internal guilt and a painful jab at German pride - especially since the same countries that now acted as judges and executioners had committed barbaric war crimes in Hiroshima and Nagasaki (that is to say). Not to mention the bombings in Tokyo and Dresden).Ultimately, the trial of figures like Hanna was an indictment against the entire German people, who, at the very least, had committed the crime of omission by not taking an interest in what happened in the concentration camps. And it is precisely in this aspect that Michael's action during the ex-lover's trial reflects this immense responsibility: stunned to realize that that mysterious romance from the past had returned as a shocking reality, the boy is still led to process his own hurt by the abandonment. That she had experienced - and her crucial decision in the sense of revealing or not a certain piece of evidence that could exonerate (or, at least, mitigate the guilt of) Hanna is an issue that refers to the attitudes of the girl (and of so many Germans) during the Second World War.These dilemmas faced by the characters in ""The Reader"", by the way, undoubtedly represent the strong point of the film written by David Hare based on the book by Bernhard Schlink (which I have not read). Unfortunately, filmmaker Stephen Daldry, perhaps not trusting the strength of his theme, employs a series of narrative devices that weaken the discussion through artificiality or melodrama - such as the long sequence that illustrates Michael's visit to a concentration camp and which, in addition to being unnecessary, sounds like a cheap exploitation of the terrible suffering experienced by Hitler's victims. In addition, the beautiful photography by Roger Deakins and Chris Menges lacks precisely for its admirable plasticity, as it strives to glamorize the sex scenes starring Michael and Hanna when, in reality, these are nothing beautiful or ""cinematographic"", since which, strictly speaking, represent moments of sadness, loneliness and shame.""The Reader"" is a sensitive film about controversial topics, among them the love affair between a 15-year-old teenager and a woman twice his age, in addition to the guilt that surrounds the Germans after the end of World War II. Directed by the same director and with a text by the screenwriter of ""The Hours"", this production is once again careful with the original story (one of the most important works of modern German literature) and with the appreciation of the work of the actors. It's not an easy movie to watch, not least because it deals with many potent themes in parallel - and in an almost banal way - but maybe that's precisely why it's so interesting. It is also worthwhile for showing Kate Winslet and a young German actor (David Kross) in touching interpretations.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The courts could have made her sign her name or the lawyer should have known she could not read or write.I cried deeply for Hanna because she is like so many in society that are forgotten. She had her life battle scars but no one really cared not even Michael. That is why many people commit suicide; they are forgotten or not understood.People read to her all her life.

Multi-layered emotional triumph,"The Reader is a real rarity in movies today; an emotional film that resists a simple explanation. If you like your movies all neatly wrapped up for emotional consumption, ""The Reader"" is not for you. Our story begins in 1995 as our hero, Ralph Fiennes comments about his daughter's impending visit. We are soon transported back to 1958 as our character is seen as a young teenager getting violently ill in the rain. He is assisted by a woman who takes him to her apartment and before a whole lot has transpired they have begun a sexual affair, an affair that both parties keep secret. We move forward eight years hence when our hero is a young law student witnessing the war crimes trial of several minor SS guards. The woman that taught him about sexual love is one of the women in the dock.As difficult as it is to sum up in under 100 words what this film is about, it is just as rewarding to the patient viewer. It covers a wide range of issues and has something important to say about a wide range of subjects, from The Holocaust to adult literacy. From lustful sex to repressed memories. Kate Winslet is absolutely stunning as a woman who ages forty years before our eyes. Every performance rings true to some extent and that is no easy task given the depth of the lead. ""The Reader"" is a film that will reward the patient viewer with one of the best paced and developed stories of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Basically, an unintentional whitewash","This is one of those rare opportunities one has, to compare and contrast a novel (Schlink's 'Der Vorleser') with its movie, both being recent and both being controversial. All in all, my take would be that the movie comes out on top. It is more nuanced than the novel, the characters are better delineated, it grips the viewer without the subtle, insidious effect the novel seems to have had on most of its critics (including top-notch ones!). The bottom line, in the novel at least, is that the monstrous behavior of former SS officers is buried in an avalanche of schmaltz, romantic delusions, euphemisms... Hanna's total lack of humanity is at least partly excused on the grounds of her illiteracy: a hard one to swallow, also because it is not at all clear how she could have joined the SS AND a tram company without even being able to write her own name; genocide becomes hidden in childish arguments (Hanna 'gladdens' the last days of many perfectly healthy, innocent young women before sending them to the gas chamber!); in the discussion about the church fire (caused by that nasty Allied air force!), much judicial quibbling is devoted to establishing who had written a report on the fire, and no-one asks the obvious question 'Why were those innocent women locked up in a church against their will?'; the death march (not shown in the movie) is made to sound, in the novel, almost like a pleasant walk before a picnic. In regard to the above issues, the movie performs rather better than the novel, due perhaps to input from non-authorial sources. Therefore, in my view, the movie deserves, perhaps, six out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Winslet just stood there and spoke the truth,"Basically I go to the theater without any previous knowledge such as user comments, reviews, or trailers simply because they spoil my pleasure and excitement. On the other hand, I refer to some basic information such as ratings, votes, or people in the film in order to judge whether it's a crap or a must-go.""The Reader"" got 7.7 points out of 10 by 28789 audiences (June 2009). Thinking about Winslet's Oscar, the number of votes seemed kind of small to me but demographic breakdown says 65% of audiences, regardless of age and gender, rated 8 or greater. As for the people in the film, I liked Winslet on ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (2004), Daldry's directing on ""Billy Elliot"" (2000). Right, I think it's a must-go for me.OK. I watched the ""The Reader"". Now let me just skip synopsis or plot here; you can get it at IMDb or the official site, right? I will touch on my impressions or comments for your reference. Actually I wrote paper on ""Holocaust"" at college but I really learned how horrible it was from the movies, not a textbook. ""Life Is Beautiful"" (1999) , ""The Pianist"" (2002), etc.For me, this is the first time to see a movie which described the viewpoint of perpetrators, not of the victims. So I thought the story seemed new and unique to me. Also the best reward of this movie was Winslet's outstanding performance. If I could borrow a quote from Eastwood, Winslet ""Just stood there and spoke the truth"", and she made her acting real.On the other hand, I felt that the movie could have been much better with less naked scenes or love affair and with more depictions of reading and mental interactions between Hanna (Winslet) and her lovely kid. I expected hope for life, not despair, would come to Hanna as a result of her redemption, you know. To be honest, I was not fully satisfied with the ending. If you are eager to watch Winslet's acting AND her voluptuous body, I guess it's worth watching at a big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Reader Wanted!,"Congratulations! You are the protagonist of this film review! Yes, you are. It is not me the writer, it is you ""the reader"". Come back! Please do not stop reading! Director Stephen Daldry's ""The Reader"" is definitely not the feel good movie of the year, but it is gripping enough to satisfy your visual-literary movie experience. Kate Winslet stars or is a supporting star (depending on which movie awards you go by) as Hannah Schmitz, a German lonely woman in the 40's who works as a transportation ticket-taker. Her young meal ticket though comes in the form of Michael Berg, a secluded teenager she meets in a side street in caring for him cause of an ailment. Eventually, Hanna's pedophile storm stars erupting when she starts having passionate sex with him on a routine basis. You don't have too read much into the fact that Michael does not mind that whatsoever. Hanna does fixate for Michael to read her novels and books; call it a foreplay literary fetish, but if it helps getting Kate Winslet into bed with you then it's a well read out plan. OK, enough! Hannah's temporary cradlerock adventure does fade when she deserts her apartment and also Michael for an employment promotion. Michael eventually reconnects with Hannah (and no, not on Facebook) years later as a law student when he witnesses a Holocaust S.S. trial which Hannah is one of the defendants. ""The Reader"" also shows a much older Michael in recent past time reminiscing on his ""Hannah-Barbaro"" experience, and in trying to open up resolving chapters in order to help the troubled older Hannah. Speaking of chapters, I will let you (the reader) visually read the remaining plot line chapters of ""The Reader"" in order for yours truly not to play the part of the antagonist ""Reader Spoiler"". Winslet's performance is worthy of all the accolades it has received. David Kross and Ralph Fiennes also delivered authentic performances as the young & older Michaels respectively. Writer-Director Stephen Daldry did demonstrate the post Holocaust doldrums in ""The Reader"", but his readiness on the narrative was primarily fixated on the impact that hiding a disability can have on people's lives. ""The Reader"" does include some inconsequential scenes that could have been read out of the film, but it is still a powerful film which you should read into. **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shame and guilt,"A great film about shame and love , its very emotional and everyone can relates to it all that packed with a great performance from Kate Wenslet I didn't read the book on which the film is based on but I think from the people's opinions the director has done a good job in adapting the Novel it was very interesting watching this story and how you could forgive this woman and even try to find ways to justify what she did also the shame you would find in the both 2 characters and how this shame haunted them and changed both of their lives Hanna who is Ashamed of being illiterate gets imprisoned for most of her life and end up committing suicide Michael is ashamed of his relationship with Hanna because she is a Nazi who committed murder cases this shame made it worse for the rest of his life he divorced, he doesn't get along much with his daughter. its an inspirational love-story film with a great role from Kate Wenslet",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I have watched it many times, and every time it touches the deepest strings of my heart.It is a movie that will make you realize that there is always more than one side of the story. I could not help feeling deeply sorry for Kate Winslet's character. I could not help feeling horrified by her actions. This movie left me sitting by the screen with my heart bleeding, my face stained with tears, and my mind racing with thoughts.Who am I to blame? Who am I to judge? Who am I to decide? These were the questions my brain sought the answers to. There is never a definitive answer.Remarkable acting is another thing that makes this movie so outstanding.

Good - but not great.,"This is a slow movie and it takes quite a while for you to get drawn in. A lot of people might give up on it for that reason.It is a worthwhile movie with a moving and touching storyline. It is more style than substance though. I did feel somewhat manipulated by the Director to make sure I felt the right emotion at the right time. Despite that, it is a well-crafted.This story does need two heavyweights to act their asses off, and I have no complaints with the casting. From what I am lead to believe the movie is as good as the book.I've read a lot of the reviews and I can see where people are coming from, both good and critical. I would recommend this movie as one to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
ambiguous drama about guilt,"I have to write about this movie because I read so many comments on Hanna being a monster. Nobody is a monster in this movie. The message of the movie is: We are all neither good nor evil, we are always a mixture of both. The world is not a black and white place, it's not even gray - it's multicolored. And if anyone sees Michael only as an innocent victim, what about not telling  anyone about Hanna's secret? His statement could have saved her life.Both protagonists  though in a totally different way - suffer from the same very human character flaw: They both have a secret they want to hide by all costs because they are ashamed of it. In order to hide this shame they both do things that are wrong. Their actions are somehow always human and understandable. (Whoever thinks he's above it suffers from an illusion.) They both eventually get eaten up by guilt and their lives take the course of their consequences.This movie is a dark and ambiguous story that upsets our values of morality showing victims as possible culprits and culprits as possible victims. The question of guilt is not being easily answered here. This movie won't help you understanding life better but it will make you think about life and maybe your personal guilt.On one side there is the law - our justice. But there is a second justice system within each of us: We judge and punish ourselves more appropriate than any court of law could ever do. Sometimes our own morality is even more radical and cruel than the one of the ""law"". When we judge ourselves, we often get ""life"" or even a death sentence - with no possibility of parole.Even though I read the book and knew the story I was deeply moved by this movie. I did not give it a ten only because in my opinion the movie only partially succeeded in showing the devastating impact that Michael's first love experience had on all his upcoming relations.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Compelling film-making...,"Starring Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes, two of my favorite actors, The Reader was what I expected it to be...an absolutely stunning movie rich with excellent acting and a compelling tale. The movie is about how a young man and Kate Winslet enjoy a sordid love affair one summer (sordid because the boy is only 15 and Kate Winslet is in her 30's). The boy falls in love with her but one day, Kate Winslet packs up and leaves without telling the young man and his heart is broken. Later in life, the young man is a law student and Kate Winslet's character is at the center of a huge trial. The movie explores themes of love, loss, and ""what is the right thing to do?"" As with most Kate Winslet movies, there is an abundance of nudity in this movie, which in my opinion, never fails to increase the sense of realism and eroticism in a particular scene or shot...and that goes for all movies; not just The Reader and not just Kate Winslet movies. The musical score to this movie supplements the visuals well and the acting is just top notch. A must-see film in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bonding and the study of human psychology,"Although it wasn't powerful or riveting as I thought it would be, it's still a alright film. Ralph Fiennes, David Kross, and Kate Winslet was perfect for there roles, especially Kate and glad they didn't cast her role with some other actress. The film has to do with a boy reading to a grown woman and build a relationship because of it and crimes committed during Nazi occupation that comes back, for redemption although Kate Winslet's character didn't seem to feel much guilt for most part. Like she said, she was only following orders, plus others that were involved much more gets off with a way lighter sentence. And during Kate Winslet's characters prison term is when Ralph Fiennes becomes her reader once again, and helps her through the time she has left behind bars. The movies has some wonderful moments, but a it's a very slow paced film to the point it can get a big annoying sometimes, and parts of it seem to drag on and on. But overall it's a decent drama with some good performances, it could have been better if it was a bit more faster paced and the script had a bit more to offer.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Monster or Victim?,"The Reader tries to tackle questions as broad as What is truth? What is justice? And, more narrowly, who should be singled out to pay for a nation's collective guilt? But the key question confronting law student Michael Berg (David Kross) is respect for Hanna Schmitz' (Kate Winslet) privacy versus the truth needed for justice.The film, directed by Stephen Daldry and based on a work of fiction Der Vorleser by Bernhard Schlink, touched on stereotypical elements of the German psyche such as an excessive need for order and approval by superiors and helped to explain why good Germans became Hitler's willing executioners. Reader is a very good movie thanks in part to the acting of Winslet and Kross (younger Michael). This is nothing against the acting of Ralph Fiennes (older Michael), but the defining scenes of the movie involved the younger rather than the older Michael. At times the film moved slowly as Daldry kept the camera on Winslet or Fiennes as if to give us time to try to decipher what secrets were in their minds. Would the film have been better in German with sub-titles? Perhaps, but I think Winslet and Fiennes made convincing enough Germans.One scene is reminiscent of Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft in The Graduate, but under the freer standards of 2008 versus 1968 the film goes on to show the culmination of their encounter. Is this a good thing or not? Perhaps The Graduate's bedroom scene suggested the contrast between jaded experience and unsure enthusiasm better than The Reader showed it in living color. The Reader also presents a reflection of a theme from Sophie's Choice (a great book, but a not-so-great movie) from the point of view of the prison guard rather than the prisoner.Another sub-plot deals with the reason six low-level female camp guards were tried for war crimes 21 years after the war's end. A survivor of the camps had published a book singling out these six. Such a book could have been a source of renewed anti-Semitism as Germans asked why the survivor is reopening old wounds by going after women who were only following orders. But Daldry brings this sub-plot to a meaningful close. In a difficult encounter that takes place in New York in 1995, Fiennes and the survivor (Rose Mather, played by Lena Olin) try to come to grips with forgiveness, absolution and responsibility.At the end of the movie, we are left with two questions: Was Hanna Schmitz an unfeeling monster who felt no remorse for her part in the murder of 300 human beings, and who used (and statutorily raped) 15-year old Michael Berg for her own pleasure? Or did Kate Winslet convince us that Hanna was a victim: a naïve young woman who believed she was only doing her duty for the Fatherland and engaging in a harmless, mutually pleasurable relationship with Michael Berg? And what about Michael Berg? Was he always destined to be an amoral attorney who never acknowledged the guilt of his parent's generation, including the guilt of Hanna? Or was he the victimnever able to enter into full relationships with others because of his youthful affair with Hanna?",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disturbing,"THE READER is a somewhat disturbing film that is hard to dislike. Interesting story and some great photography, direction and acting. The disturbing aspect is the character flaws in both Hannah and Michael. He's always so remorseful with tears coming out of his eyes every five minutes. Hannah is a difficult character to understand which makes it all that more disturbing. What's so shameful about being illiterate? While there were no excuses for what she did as a camp guard, she could have saved herself by admitting she couldn't have wrote that discriminating letter. To compound that, why doesn't Michael go ahead and defend her? Just plain stupid and totally unbelievable, yet fascinating. KATE WINSLET and David KROSS were extremely good in their roles, less so Ralf Finnes. As an adult, the older Michael should have seen an analyst as he is troubled throughout his entire adult hood and a wimp at that. He needed as much help as Hannah in his own way. The time lasps are a bit illogical as well. One of the best performances, however, is the one given by Lena Olin as both mother and daughter. A brilliant performance what is never talked about or discussed. She should have been up for a supporting award at least. How does the public and critics let these performances slip by the wayside? Too much attention on Winslet I guess. Despite reservations, THE READER should be seen. Good DVD extras plus lots of deleted and extended scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
notorious for all the wrong reasons,"At the time of it's release The Reader caused considerable controversy which clouded its qualities. Everyone was upset about nudity and sex, as well as the alleged glorification of the Nazis, yet little has been said about the qualities of the movie. The advantage of writing this review today is that we can take a step back and talk about the movie itself.In my opinion, The Reader is an exploration of guilt and shame. It addresses the situation in which any of us might think what we should or shouldn't have done. Given the historical context, namely Second World War in Germany, this becomes a potent dilemma to ponder over.A considerable part of the cast plays SS-personnel and shows them as they were: Ordinary people who made their choices under extraordinary circumstances. Obviously they haven't chosen wisely. But it is worthy mentioning that the victors write the history. Had Germany won, the SS-members would have been the heroes of the fatherland. So their choice was partially a gamble which didn't pay out.But there is another plot line. The main character in his youth meets a lady and they engage in a sexual relationship. From today's perspective the lady would have been exposed as a child molester. However, after WWII there has been a shortage of men in all countries involved, a fact that helps understand this escapade.The cast delivers a solid performance. Overall, this is an excellent movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Until viewing the film, I never learned of the ""secret"" and I won't reveal it here. This is a bittersweet film that you cannot easily forget! In this film, the explicit scenes were not the most memorable scenes. I found the courtroom scenes to be the most compelling. I'm glad that Nicole Kidman did not get the role.

Wished for more,"Recently saw ""The Reader,"" with Kate Winslet. Frankly, I don't know why the many kudos for this film nor for Winslet receiving the Academy Award for her performance in it. For me, the story didn't unfold so much as plod lugubriously with far too much time lavished upon the sexual foray between Winslet's character and the teenage boy. I consider Kate Winslet a decent enough actress, capable, perhaps, of delivering an Oscar winning performance, but it didn't happen in this film - not necessarily because of lack in ability on her part. As written, the scope of personality in the character Ms Winslet portrays is far too narrow and limited to allow for much more than looking mostly sullen or abstracted in scene after scene; limitations far to great to allow for rendering a performance that warrants an Oscar. In other words, she did the best with what little she had to works with, but, alas, it wasn't enough for me.Also, I would argue that the film's subtext, the trial of the prison guards, was an opportunity squandered. I feel it should have been the film's main focus and thrust. To relegate the trial to subtext dilutes it of it's power to dramatize the gripping revelations that would shine a light on what and how this sad, proud woman had come to be sitting in that chair, in that courtroom, before that tribunal.Lastly, I was much bothered by the complete disconnect between the Ralph Feines (Feinnes?) character as teenager and older man in later years. Seems to me that by the time a boy is in his mid to late teens there is some indication or resemblance to his later adult self, however vague. There is no such connection here - not remotely. The only ""resemblance"" between them is the fact that they are both male. Again, and alas, it wasn't enough for me.All in all however, the film did have it's moments....",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Disappointing and insulting,"This movie didn't impress me at all. It's too mushy, and I must say politically hurts my feelings. If I had survived the Holocaust, I would be deeply disappointed and insulted. I cannot say that the actors didn't give their best, but I definitely wouldn't choose this film into top 5 for the Oscar. It's predictable and what I cannot stand is the stupidity of the main female character. Being illiterate doesn't necessarily mean that you're unaware of your actions. The victim is definitely not a victim, and I cannot sympathize with her illiteracy nor embarrassment for being that way, which is the main goal in this movie. The mistakes she did were shown as secondary, almost irrelevant compared to her reading disability. The only reason I gave a five to this movie is because the actors did quite a good job, otherwise I'd give a much lesser grade. As for Kate Winslet winning the Oscar for this role, I think that Meryl Streep should have won the Oscar for her performance in ""Doubt"".",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Unbelievable Tale of Sturm and Drang,"While I was eager as I was to see The Reader, I was completely disappointed in this improbable and sentimental story. While I have not doubt that a lonely woman would leap into bed with this handsome young man, I found it highly unlikely that she would be overjoyed having The Illiad read to her. What is she, a scholar? I am well-educated and would be bored to death by The Illiad.Without revealing anything, I would say that was just one of the many absurdities in this totally unbelievable film. Except for the sex, it was impossible to understand anybody's motives for anything they did, or more to the point, did not do. While the critics praised this film and the Academy gave Kate a well-deserved Oscar, I feel that is a laughable film filled with unlikely characters being ever-so solemn and tormented based on a single premise that is completely unlikely.",,Anonymous,Romance
Thought provoking film?,"Yes it is. It is also a very decent film, and I can't see why it attracted so much criticism upon its release. Unfortunately films to do with the holocaust don't seem to go down well with our European neighbours, and I sense that it is something that they would rather forget.Fortunately or unfortunately this is exactly the type of film which always seems to get all the armchair amateur arty philosophers discussing the meaning of life for hours. Guys, it is just a film, a good one but just a film nevertheless.I thought the film was a little bit too long and the middle part could have been shortened slightly.Up until seeing this film recently on DVD I had never been a massive fan of Kate Winslet, not from Titanic onwards, but in this film she was absolutely magnificent and her acting was of the very highest order. Ralph Fiennes was his usual very competent controlled self, but I found his character (Berg) to be infuriating and especially so in the scene when he meets Winslet in the prison canteen towards the end - still, it shows what a good actor he is.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the most intelligent multiplex films in an age,"I suppose I should have expected more from ""The Reader"" than I actually did. After all, this was the same writing and directing team, (David Hare and Stephen Daldry), who had done such a superb job in bringing Michael Cunningham's 'difficult' novel ""The Hours"" to the screen. Perhaps it was the subject matter, (a May/September romance, both in terms of age as well as in duration, with the Holocaust thrown in for dramatic backdrop), or perhaps it was just the publicity afforded Kate playing older and dowdier than she actually is as if deglamourizing a glamorous actress in itself amounts to 'acting'. I should have known better. Hare, Daldry, Winslet and Fiennes don't do second-rate or hand-me-downs. ""The Reader"" is superb.I haven't read the original novel but you might say that it, too, is 'difficult'. The film certainly deals in weighty themes; guilt, forgiveness, retribution, redemption. It is primarily a love story and it covers a period of years. As with ""The Hours"" it moves back and forth in time. It has a conventional beginning and end; it's the middle that is off-kilter. The Holocaust does indeed form the background but it is not used flippantly or as mere window-dressing. This is one of those rare commercial movies to talk about after you see it. It is a movie to discuss and argue over, one which engages the head as well as the heart and it certainly does engage the heart; I was moved to tears more than once, (and not in a sentimental way, either).The story is simple even if the themes are complex. A 15 year old boy has a brief but very passionate affair with a woman who helps him when he takes ill in the street. After a few months she leaves him. During their affair she asks him to read to her before or after sex, anything from Tin Tin to Lady Chatterly which, despite having seduced a 15 year old, she finds distasteful. The boy goes on to study law and a few years later he sees the woman again only now she is a defendant in a war-crimes trial. It is at this point that the film takes off; issues that might have seemed black-and-white become fudged or more complex. The film deals, not just with feelings and emotions, but with intellect as well. There is a good deal more here than meets the eye.As I've said I haven't read the source novel, which was originally written in German, but the script seems to me a superb example of the art of writing for the screen in balancing the obvious emotionality of the subject with the kind of deeper themes the subject engenders, while Daldry's direction is a model of restraint. As for Winslet's much vaunted performance, she really is extraordinary. This really is a 'difficult' part. The woman is superficial in so far as she reveals nothing of her character, at least initially. She is a tabula rasa and it is left to us to fill in the blanks, (although I think an audience will cop on quicker than the boy does). And it's not just a case of playing dowdy or wearing make-up that ages the actress beyond recognition. It's in how much of the character Winslet reveals, and in stages, to the audience. It's in the physicality of her emotions and not in her appearance that Winslet's performance rests. She deserves every award she has won and more.The boy is played by a newcomer, David Kross, and he's fine in so far as it goes, but faced with more seasoned performers he seems a little out of his depth. In later life he is played by Ralph Fiennes; it's a small part for Fiennes but he's as good here as he's ever been in anything else I've seen him do. Fiennes is a master of reticence and silence who can convey more with a look than most actors can with a whole page of dialogue. Perhaps I would have been more impressed with Kross' performance had a lesser actor than Fiennes played him elsewhere. There are also fine cameos from those fine actors Bruno Ganz and Lena Olin.By now, you may have gathered I think very highly of ""The Reader"". a film which treats its audience with the same intelligence as those involved in its execution. In an age of multiplex fodder, for this we should be truly grateful.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Emotion laid foundation,"""What was the nature of your friendship?"". Why did Micheal stay silent for a minute when Martha asks this question? You know, the answer is the entire story of the movie. The Reader is some kind of a work that talks about a mature-immature romance and in the sense a deep penetrated affection between a 15-year boy and a 30-year aged woman. Both ascription suites their relationship and also it invites us to the problems and the nasty acts of the Nazis in World War II. Hanna is been the culprit and she serves her imprisonment sentence. When we drew back to the past, the movie begins with what we said earlier. It commences with the relationship of Hanna and Micheal. Their love-making, Micheals's reading of classic books to Hanna, and more than that a motherly affection of Hanna towards Micheal. They don't want only to make sex. Micheal has something far more than that. That's why he calls her for cycling. There nourishes a deep bond between them. But it is clear that something is hidden inside Hanna. She breaks that relationship deliberately and leaves Micheal forever. There unveils the hidden face of Hanna, while after eight years Micheal finds her in a courtroom for his studies as the main accused of the murder of 300 jews. The rest of the things developed the movement of the story. So stunned by the acting of Kate Winslet and I completely appreciate her courage to do the part. She simply carries Hanna into her.

What this movie is all about,"Hanna = traditional epic hero of Greek tragedies and symbolism for Germany(wonder why Micheal is always reading the Odysseys)She is ideal: beautiful but strong, stoic but compassionate (she offered the condemned Jews what little she could), hardworking, excelling at everything she does, but quite down to earth (despite being a superhuman) - briefly on her behalf re church fire: - Premise 1: prisoners in Church have been convicted and essentially sentenced to death by the state, by people who knows what she doesn't, people who could read, people similar to the judges who would sentence her to life imprisonment, she believes in the tiers of society (you still wonder why she never challenges her sentence) - Premise 2: letting the prisoners out would certainly add to the chaos - Premise 3: the prisoners certainly would attempt escape only to be re-captured and executed - Conclusion: letting the prisoners out would benefit NO ONEHelpful to note: Hanna DID NOT join the SS by free will, she need the job b/c she had to give up her promotion by Siemens (remember she quit after being promoted from train conductor)Her forgivable flaw is her pride. Combined with her circumstances/faith -> her predictable downfall. She's an epic hero after allA victim to her circumstances: she does not get the education she craved and deserved in time (A victim to its circumstances, the fatherland and the hardworking, honest (sturdy) German people suffered unjust hardships post WWI. Germany was unjustly forbidden to have a military force every nation deserves).In the end, she refuses to let circumstances further take advantage of her and learns to read (yep a 60 yo retarded ADHD learns to read - maybe Mandibule is projecting) (parallel: Germany acquires a strong military under Hitler and goes for a brief vacation in Poland and France to rectify the wrong). Regains pride but dies. Regains respect but loses to the ruskies and Yankees.The plot of the movie was made to be predictable because: A Good re-watch value. It is a classic. A Bray I'll actually pay for. B It would not be a Greek tragedy otherwise: you fall in love with the hero, you see her inescapable doom and you get catharsis (what the Jew woman recommends to Micheal)Learning objectives: 1. Don't judge with today's standards, yesterdays' actions. 2. Things are not black/white. If they are to you, you are either a dark sith (per Yoda) or bipolar per DSM-IV.Beautiful movie on an emotional level, however, on an intellectual level, the movie is a subconscious justification of WWII. The depiction of the ideal Aryan superhuman character tortured by the insensate rest of the world compels the ratification of the injustice. And what about that snobby Jew woman telling Micheal illiteracy isn't a Jewish problem while Hanna had to learn to read in a prison - after watching the movie, i don't like 'em Jews so gud.Those are the major points. Should be easier now to fill in the gaps. I'll be back to expound if necessary.BTW fool, in case you got distracted, the reason Hannah dies is because she had to for the cat hairs.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Adapted to suit US tastes?,"Perhaps it is the fault of expectations formed after the parade of awards, or, more likely, of those formed after having read the amazing book by Bernard Schlink? Whichever it is, I found The Reader-movie quite unnecessarily sentimentalized.Ralph Fiennes, one of my favorite actors, plays so badly that it almost causes a toothache. The final scene, with the daughter and the grave, is simply pathetic.Additionally, the film introduces scenes that I do not remember from the book, and which by their ambiguity acquire a sinister meaning. When the judge asks the mother-survivor of the camp how many people died in the fire, she answers that they all died. Then he asks her how she survived, and she does not answer. What are we to deduce from that missing answer?Further, when Michael visits the daughter-survivor, the opulence of her New York flat is in a striking contrast with the pathetic prison cell that we have seen just before. Is the conclusion that Jews, if they survive, always know how to take care of themselves? Lena Ohlin is completely unconvincing in the role of the aged daughter.Kate Winslett is doing her best, although one would think that, what with the contemporary knowledge of cosmetics, one should age women on the screen much better. (Well, I do admit that I think it quite often - they all tend to look like wearing peculiar masks.)All this does not take away the utmost importance of moral questions asked in the film (not the ones about German responsibility, asked so many times before): did Michael did what he did from respect for her, from fear for his own situation, from the sense of (legal) justice, or from all of the above? It brings to mind Giorgio Agamben's reading of ""Bartleby, The Scrivener"" and the force (or lack of it) and the consequences of ""I prefer not to""...I do admit, however, that mine is a European reading, based on great many books and films on Holocaust. Perhaps this sentimental version of The Reader fulfills a useful role, gently introducing North Americans to the complexities and horrors of Holocaust.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely incredible film; worthy of the Oscar,"This poignant film took a devastating look at Germany post WWII. Having lived in, and being born in Germany, before the fall of the wall, I have witnessed the sense of guilt that does not easily leave a nation. Even young Germans today do not identify with the Germany of the past.Kate Winslet's intricate and provocative performance was incredible. She embodied Hanna Schmitz in every emotion and detail. I definitely see David Kross' career blossoming as well, as a direct result of this film.Many people argued at the Berlin FilmFest last month that this film was all about the Holocaust, but directly, it is not. It is about guilt, illiteracy, love, loss, family, and questioning everything we know. Nevertheless, the aftermath the Shoah is shown on screen in the highest of sensitivity. I really defend the high amount of Holocaust films being made; that period in history; WWII is fascinating and devastating and every story must be told.The Reader is undeniably the top film of 2008 and worth every accolade it receives.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Like a good book that you can't put down,"While not the best example of a Holocaust movie, THE READER transcends that by portraying a sensitive and emotionally moving story about a man's relationship with a woman he later finds out was an SS guard. Every aspect of this film was exquisitely put together, from the cinematography to the score, and all of the performances were excellent as well. In particular, Kate Winslet gives a nuanced performance as the former SS guard and Ralph Fiennes is wonderfully understated as Michael Berg (in middle-age), the titular reader. Without giving anything away, the depth of the title's meaning will become apparent about midway through the film. Thematically, it deals with secrecy in relationships and being able to read people. How does a person's past affect perception of them, especially if learned after the fact? Does it change what they mean to us? All of those questions are worth pondering and are dealt with in an interesting way through the lens of the Holocaust. The only issue I took with the film is that towards the end, Michael has a meeting with a survivor who somewhat punishes the audience for feeling any sympathy whatsoever for the woman at the center of the story. Is it right to sympathize with someone who is responsible for horrible things? I'll leave that up for other people to decide. Bottom line, this was a well-produced, finely acted drama that deserved the awards attention that it got.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The performance of Winslet's career & she's not done yet.,"This is a film that is not for the young or for those looking for popcorn fare. This is for ADULTS & those interested in moral questions & justification to all sorts of unspeakable acts that we all are capable of doing. I can't express how good Kate Winslet is in her portrayal. In all of her Oscar nominations this is the best work. She is absolutely convincing playing this morally questionable character. Although she won the Oscar, the young man playing opposite her is excellent as well & it can't be said enough how good he is opposite Mrs. Mendes which is no small feat in itself. This is probably not for anyone younger than 21 & most definitely not for those looking for bubblegum light-hearted Hannah Montana let's just call it *Stuff* Anyone that is familiar & interested in the European theater of World War II are those who will be most interested. I would also say this is acting at it's absolute finest & nobody does it better than Kate Winslet. I'm betting Meryl Streep's 15 or 16 nominations will someday be overtaken by this beautiful superb woman.

After A Slow Start It Picked Up Steam,"I found the first hour or so of this movie to be somewhat tough slogging. The film is set in Germany in 5 different time periods - 1958, 1966, 1976, 1988 and 1995, and moves fairly fluidly between them. Each period offers a depiction of the somewhat complicated relationship between Michael and Hannah. The first hour deals primarily with the 1956 time period. Michael is a 15 year old who becomes ill and is helped by 36 year old Hannah. The two develop a bond, and begin an affair which is rather explicitly depicted. Michael, played in this time period by David Kross, is a fairly typical teenager smitten and somewhat obsessed with an older woman. Hannah, played throughout the movie by Kate Winslet, was a mysterious character, at the same time both cold and distant, and yet very passionate and caring, and one who loved to have Michael read to her. The affair ends abruptly when Hannah disappears. Fast forward to 1966, when Michael is a law student and his class attends a trial of SS guards, where he discovers to his horror that Hannah was one of them. It's at this point that I found the movie really picked up steam. The earlier relationship between Hannah and Michael was interesting but in all honesty not that powerful. Having seen them make love once, I didn't really need to see it 5 or 6 times. With the trial, though, a number of interesting angles began to be explored.The first came from the 1966 trial itself, and Hannah's rationalization of her actions in letting several hundred Jewish prisoners die in a fire when she could have released them. ""We couldn't let them escape,"" she says. ""There would have been chaos."" When the judge continues to question her she asks with what appeared to be complete bewilderment ""What would you have done?"" - a question for which the judge offered no answer. In the end Hannah is sentenced to 20 years in prison. In a way this is another film that depicts the inability to answer many questions about Nazi Germany. In that sense, Hannah is a troubling character. She accepts responsibility for what happened but expresses little guilt for it. ""Why did you join the SS?"" she's asked. ""I needed a job."" You get the sense that Hannah doesn't really ""get"" the horrors of the Third Reich of which she was a part - albeit a minor one.The second interesting angle was the resumption in the relationship between Michael and Hannah. Having been appalled by the fact that she was an SS guard, Michael struggles with his conscience, because he also realizes that the piece of evidence that got her the harsh sentence wasn't valid. Hannah admitted having written the report about the incident while the other guards on trial denied it, but Michael realized she couldn't have written it - she was illiterate, which was why she enjoyed being read to. It's an unanswered question why she admitted to something she didn't do. Perhaps it was to assuage an unacknowledged guilt, but it was never explained. Ten years later, Michael begins sending her tape recordings of books she liked which he's recited into a recorder. She uses them as a springboard to teach herself to read. Eventually, in 1988, when Hannah is due to be released, the prison contacts him because he's her only connection to the outside world. Their reunion in the prison is somewhat awkward, but he makes arrangements to set her up on the outside, but tragedy prevents that from happening.The relationship between the two is the focal point of the movie and it's explored in pretty good depth, with good performances by those portraying both characters (Ralph Fiennes plays the older Michael.) I wasn't entirely convinced of the need for the 1995 scenes which depict the relationship between Michael and his adult daughter. For some reason that I didn't understand, this served as a springboard to Michael's reminiscences of Hannah, but the connection wasn't clear. I also wasn't clear why Michael felt the need to take his daughter to Hannah's grave and begin to explain to her the story of their relationship. At first I wondered if, by chance, the real secret would turn out to be that the daughter was actually Hannah's daughter, but once actress Hannah Herzsprung was introduced in the role it became obvious that she was too young. As a result, I found Herzsprung's role superfluous, its significance being left largely unexplained.In the end, I found this an interesting movie that raises a number of questions and issues, although not offering any real resolution to them. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Oscar worthy,"""The Reader"" directed by Oscar-nominated director Stephen Daldry should not have been the 5th film to earn an Oscar-nomination as Best Picture. That honor should have gone to ""Doubt"" or ""The Dark Knight"". But, Holocaust-themed pictures are popular with the Academy so this film was nominated. However, this is not a great movie like ""Schindler's List"" but only very-good, like ""The Pianist""Michael is a high-schooler in West Germany in the mid-50s when he is afflicted with scarlet fever. When he gets sick on the streets, Hannah (the very good Kate Winslet) comes to his aid. After months of convalescense, he goes to Hannah's house to thank her for her assistance and soon the pair starts a romance. It mostly consists of Michael's reading literary classics to Hannah and then sex. This tryst lasts a few months and then peters out.Almost a decade later, Michael is a law student and as part of a seminar on the legal ramifications of the Holocaust he attends a trial of several women charged with war-related crimes. Michael is very surprised to see Hannah on trial and has crucial evidence about her possible complicity.

An actor's film,"Based on a German novel by Bernhard Schlink, The Reader was turned into an British film, directed by Stephen Daldry of Billy Elliot and The Hours fame, adapted by David Hare (The Hours) and stars Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes.Michael Berg (David Kross) is a 15-year-old living in 1958 who has Scarlett Fever. A train conductor, Hanna Schmidt (Winslet) helps him out and after he thanks her starts to have an affair with the older woman. Their relationship is cemented by Michael reading anything classic novels to Tintin comics to her. But after their relationship breaks down, Michael becomes a Law student at Heidelberg University, but when studying German War Guilt and see a war crimes trial he see that Hanna use to be a SS guard. What is made even worst is she is being made a scapegoat by the other guards for a massacre during a death march. Michael is left with a choice to relieve Hanna's secret to save her from a long prison sentence.The Reader was a film that was obviously made with the Award bodies in mind and its main strength is its actors. The Reader does have an excellent cast, Winslet got to win her first Oscar, Fiennes is pretty much great in anything he does and the young Kross shows great promise, giving a believable performance as a young man ending up in a relationship with a older woman and how he would act and the decision he has to face. The main three actors are very natural in their roles even though it is a little weird that some actors speaking with German accents and others with English ones. There are also very well supported by other actors in the movie, from the likes of Bruno Ganz and Karoline Herfurth.There are mentions of ideas of German war guilt and personal guilt with the SS guards trying to avoid their own collective guilt placing it all on one person. But the main story is about Michael and Hanna and their relationship, from the early, almost stalker like start to its evolution to a sexual relationship and its aftermath. Michael is continually drawn to her in some form, but also wants to keep his distances. It is a complex relationship and you could easily argue that Michael should have told her secret. But in the past Hanna was quiet a cold and manipulative, she is not that nice of a person so it is no wonder that their relationship breaks down. They are complex characters.The direction by Stephen Daldry is standard, nothing stylist but the period details are well captured and he knows how to move the film along. It is a tender sort of film, look at human emotion and a social drama. It is certainly a well made film and Daldry just wanted everything to grow slowly, trying to be as real as possible, though some things are a bit of a stretch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

From the beginning of the affair and also from the past. That leads to consequences for his future life.There are many interesting questions about guilt here.

We are all innocent,"Fancy a heartbreak? Watch this film.Michael is a successful middle-aged lawyer with a restless personal life. He remembers his teenage youth when he met and had a short but passionate affair with his first love - a simple older woman who was living an orderly, dutiful but reclusive life. The age difference could be disturbing to some, but I think the woman being full of repressed feelings and individuality, she was on a similar emotional level as our teenage boy and used her sexual energy to experience some freedom through ecstasy.For pretty obvious reasons (to the viewer), she asks Michael to read books to her out loud. She is so keen to keep this particular reason a secret that she even causes great harm to herself protecting it.I know I'm talking in sign language here, but don't wanna spoil the story. So I'll end by saying that it really is worth watching. A tale about how sometimes doing your 'duty' for the lunatic people that run your country will be considered evil by later generations.

"Speaking out or remaining silent, that's the question","""The reader"" is a complex film. The relationship between an adolescent boy and a woman in her mid thirties maybe the most spectacular element of the film, it is certainly not its essence.As a war film it's of the modern kind, the Nazi not being a one dimensional monster but a complicated human being. The question is however if ""The reader"" can be considered as a proper war film? The film is situated after the Second World War and, although Kate Winslet is te most famous name of the cast, the most interesting character is Michael Berg played by Ralph Fiennes, The Michael Berg character is born in 1943 and thus totally post war.In effect the Second World War produces some moral dillema's that Michael Berg is facing as a student. In more abstract form these dillelema's ae discussed in the lectures Michael is following. These alteration of theory and practice reminded me of ""A short film about killing"" (1988, Krzysztof Kieslowski) in which a student talks about a murder case in his final legal exam and shortly thereafter has to handle his first real murder case as a lawyer.The way Michael handles his moral dillema (speaking out or remaining silent) influences (his relationships with women for) the rest of his life. In a key scene (in my opinion) Michael has a discussion with a fellow student. These fellow student reproaches the generation of their parents for their behaviour towards the Nazi's. They just watched and didn't do a thing. There own generation (that of Michael and his fellow student) would have done a much better job. The way Michael handles his moral dillema in the rest of the film casts a lot of doubt on this rather bold claim.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the best performance given by Kate,"Undoubtedly, Kate was the show stealer in this movie; with a slow pace starting the movie shuttle to and fro between past and present with lot of emphasis put across characterization. Performance by David Kross is also commendable, special mention to the courtroom sequence where Kate Winslet is prosecuted. In my opinion his role sort of overshadowed the role of Ralph Fiennes. The movie has some of its own moments which can only be described as though provoking and unique in respect.

Sharply directed and meaningful picture that Kate steals,"Years after having an affair with Hannah Schmitz (Winslet), Michael Berg (Kross) is at law school and sees his former lover in court, defending her involvement in a war crime.Based on Bernard Schlink's book, The Reader is a wondrous adaptation that finally answered the viewer's question as to when Kate Winslet would win an Oscar.Kate's strong performance is not only her first Oscar winning scene stealer, but arguably one of the finest dramatic performances she has ever delivered. The English actress has certainly had an eventful career with her breakthrough romantic sweetheart in Titanic to the clunky and spontaneous Clementine in Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind. Both Oscar nominations but against Helen Hunt in 1997 and Hilary Swank in 2005, there was perhaps a lacking in intense drama to be a true contender. Both fantastic performances, but the academy certainly favours those dramatic performances and here, there is certainly no shortage on the drama front.Set in Germany after the Second World War, Schmitz and Berg form a controversial relationship where Schmitz holds the ropes over the teenager. The formation of this relationship is a charming opening. There is no baggage for developing the character's background and we are virtually straight into the shocking manor of the sexual pairing of the two central protagonists.From Schmitz's hidden secret to Berg's obedience there are certainly a few complications along with the buoyancy and free nature of the affair. And therein lies the drama, and along with it some rightfully deserved Oscar nominations and a finally rewarded recognition for Britain's most promising actress.The beginning of the story establishes the intricate bonds of Berg's confinement in his own home under the watchful eye of his family where Schmitz discovers she has problems living alone. The realistic concepts brings the viewer's right down to earth with a wonderful scripted screenplay that at first keeps the dialogue as minimalistic as possible as the scene setting gets a wonderful work over by director Daldry. The story is then notched up into a more controversial drama as the affair escalades and brings around a sad moment half way through. Years after the affair when Berg sees Schmitz in court does the drastic implication of the war and political opinions come to the screen.There are issues of Post war implications, Jew imprisonment and punishment in prison that are all heavily debated in the court case that demonstrates the power of the law against doing what is right.When Ralph Fiennes enters the picture do we see a soft and meaningful feeling of sorrow and depression that rightfully explains his actions, which rounds off the collection of acting performances and though this a wondrously scripted and directed picture, it will be remembered for an astounding performance by Winslet.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simple rules to generate a genocide,"Considering that the actors have been sufficiently and deservedly applauded in other commentaries, I would like to stress a point which seems to me very important.The story of Hanna Schmitz involvement with nazi activities, which included murdering of hundreds of civilians imprisoned at Auswitch is something very amazing.This story tells what a simple person, on one hand, committed with obedience to his(her) superiors and with the job he(she) is expected to do (by these superiors), and on the other hand, a person who lacks moral references (as basic as the Ten Commands), is capable of.During the hole film, Hanna looks as someone skilled in discipline and obedience issues, and incapable to deal with moral issues. I ask myself if this behavior is programmable, i.e, if millions can be taught methodicaly to behave the same way than Hanna.If the answer is yes, this simple story shows how it is possible to generate a genocide in a very well organized way.Yet, a mystery remains in Hanna mind: what did she like in the stories which were read to her? And above this, in what consisted the fun she experienced listening to the stories that were read to her?",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Who are the real criminals?,"If any actress deserves to win two Academy Awards for Best Actress in the same year (for Revolutionary Road and The Reader) that actress is Kate Winslet. Kate Winslet is the greatest actress in the world today and proves it again in a stupendous performance in a story that deals with never ending guilt, personal shame and the nature of evil. Only an actress of Ms. Winslet's skill could have performed the role of Hanna Schmidt. Although a concentration camp guard and Nazi war criminal, one can develop a measure of sympathy for this character who herself becomes a victim. At no times does this movie offer any excuses for Schmidt's behavior. She was following orders and it resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, deaths that could have been easily prevented. But was she acting alone? Did she give the orders? Or was she just a cog in a huge murder machine which years later makes her a scapegoat? The audience is presented with a plain-looking but passionate woman who is just trying to survive and has a personal secret which she wants to hide. And although she served in a criminal organization and was party to the commission of horrible crimes, it seems that the real criminals are those who fail to reveal information about her that would have at least mitigated her guilt. Although Ms. Winslet correctly is the star of the movie, the driving character in this story is the boy lover who many years later fails to act to save his one-time lover. The first part of this moving which tries to show the intensity of the initial relationship is unconvincing. There's lots of steamy bedroom scenes but ultimately they fall flat as boy-man is just a little too boyish and Hanna Schmidt is just a little too aloof to convey a sense of a powerful bond. So the audience has to accept as a given that the bond exists in order for the rest of the story to be effective. The movie however does pick up in pace and intensity when the boy now a young man sees his ex-lover on trial for war crimes, crimes that he knows, and has evidence to prove, she could not have committed or at least ordered. The conflict is framed. The players are on the field. Hanna Schmidt is hapless; her secret obvious; her victimization complete. She was doing her job, doing what she was ordered to do. Did that make her a criminal? Indeed, who are the real criminals?Bruno Ganz is great as the boy-man's teacher and mentor.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film moved me,"This film moved me. It has so much feeling it pulls you in and does not let go. As soon as I watched it I started it again. I am actually pretty critical about films and do not give high marks easily. Love, pain, romance, passion, fear. It is raw emotion and need on film. Kate Winslet is wonderful and she is not shy to play the role of a mature woman. David Kross is fascinating to watch transform from boy to man. Ralph Fiennes...what can I say...he blew me away! Some people may not like the idea of a younger boy and and older woman relationship, but I think that in such times and circumstances humans seek others like moths seek a flame. It is a times warm and funny and gut wrenching and sad. It is a lesson in human nature. Once you start it you will not be able to shut it off.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's not ok !,"The movie it's ok but not a breathtaking story.
The reason I wrote review it's because I get quite amazed of one thing.
WHY IN THE WHOLE WORLD WE KEEP IN REMINDING THE WORLD OF GERMANY AND SECOND WORLD WAR EVEN EFTER 75 YEARS PAST AWAY ?
It's this subject so dear to Hollywood ? Atrocities were and are constantly in human history. They should have a place in the history books but not t necessarily and constantly in the movie theaters to TV screens.
There are many other actual dramas all over the world. Famine, wars Syria, Palestine and many others. Why do we have constantly plagued with Nazi Germany which is gone for good for 75 years ago but we have wars today.
To me this is propaganda and I don't like it !",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

"emotionally engaging, impressively thoughtful but very sad‏","Winslet is really Oscar-worthy in this powerful adaptation of Bernhard Schlink's novel. Ralph Fiennes is also perfect but Kate is more than terrific, her performance showing passion passion and a sad emptiness at the same time, playing a woman never able to understand the consequences of her actions. The subject handled is very sensitive but screenwriter and director Stephen Daldry have done a perfect job dealing with it in an engrossing way. The story is for the most part fluid and for the whole part elegant and superbly crafted. An adaptation of book boosted by Winslet's central and very difficult role. This season has seen several stories set under The Third Reich (Valkyrie, Defiance for instance) but this one is surely the most provocative, thought provoking and surely the most meaningful. The Reader is thoughtful, absorbing and packed with delicate twists as well as with impressive sequences.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The film shows both sides of the story.,"The film tells the story of a teenager named Michael who lived in West Germany during the Cold War in 1958. He meets a girl, Hanna, over 30 years old, with whom he's been lovingly related for a few months. As an adult, Michael is in a conflicting situation in his life.It demonstrates very interesting aspects of the question of how people directly involved with Nazism in World War II were positioned. These people often didn't have enough authority to stop doing something to save other people, as they would eventually be seen as traitors, which would probably lead these to death. Hanna, for example, who worked for a Nazi organization that participated in the act of selecting Jews for death, despite knowing that she was causing serious problems, shows that the Nazi system prevented her from going against such attitudes, either by freeing Jewish people or by avoiding referring them to concentration camps. Being subordinate, her wills, as well as that of many others, might not correspond with what happened in practice. In this way, it would be a mistake to say that everyone involved in nazifacism was acting on their own, that is, that everyone would be essentially evil. In fact, they were influenced by the media and representatives so intensely that they did not have the courage to counter the ideals in that situation. On top of that, in a more extreme situation, they could lose track of what was being been doing, causing confusion between the distinction of right or wrong.Another very important point is the question of how the situation of holocaust survivors turned out. Ilana Mather, one of the Jewish survivors, makes people reflect that the moment the Jews went through didn't help them to learn anything, as constant fear locks people in a world where there are no good things and no time to reflect. She also points out that, even with the issue of recognition by Germany and other countries of the mistakes made during the war, the sense of sadness of thousands of Jewish families will still remain.The film addresses the issue of this war in a very touching way, making the audience both reflect the side of those found guilty of the tragedies as well as those who have suffered. This view on both sides becomes important to better understand the way in which the Germans acted in a way influenced by a superior force, whom to obey, and also the post-war issue, by showing, in relation to the Jews, that there is no to be the same person after surviving this. All of these elements make the film very impactful and touching.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A True masterpiece but not for everyone,"Kate Deserves her Oscar. Really, She does. Ms. Winslet and young Mr.Kross rightfully deserve the praise for their superb acting. Ralph Fiennes has also done a very good job. The movie does what it does best. It captures the intricacies and intimacies of human relationships splendidly. The movie is rated R for the obvious sexual content. But that aside there are many heart wrenching moments that'll make you forget you're watching a movie. One last thing. Best not to treat this movie as just two hours of entertainment, there is something to be learned here. Don't watch this movie unless you're prepared to do some thinking",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A wonderful surprise!,"Who knew that a film called 'The Reader' would be a controversial film about paedophilia in post Nazi Germany. I suppose its like being surprised that 'The English Patient' isn't completely shot in a hospital. I'm a big fan of Ralph Feinnes, I may never have watched this film if he wasn't in it. I mean seriously it's called 'The Reader' - reading is not the most stimulating of activities when you're doing it so why make a blockbuster about someone else doing it!? But wrong I was, this is the most gut wrenching, thought provoking roller-coaster I have watched this year. It tackles two of the most sensitive topics imaginable with a completely unbiased brush only bent on telling a compelling and emotional story. If you like that sort of cold-but-true Ralph Feinnes film where nobody really conveys emotion but the emotions that are implied rip you out of your seat then you will love this film. Not much here for people that don't like romantic dramas but so much for people that do! The TV guide listed this as 'the performance of winslets career' and that is completely correct, immediately you're not looking at the lady that was in Titanic any more, she blows you out of the water. No bad acting all round really but everyone else has a pretty easy ride compared to winslets character.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Interpretation of the Book.,"And that must have been a challenge, as a narrator, who weaves the story, must have a different rendering on screen.The story is compelling, and takes place in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Stephen Daldry brings his fine directing skills to this complex story of human morality and frailty and its far reaching effects. Bernhard Schlink's best-selling German novel, ""The Reader,"" is the source and he had input into this screen treatment.David Kross, a newcomer, gives a wonderful performance as Michael when he gets involved with Hanna, played by Kate Winslet, after falling ill on the street. She offers him assistance. Their illicit affair blossoms when he gets well and goes to thank her for her help.Part of their connection is Michael's reading to her from an assortment of books that he brings.My only problem with this screen interpretation is the gratuitous sex between an underage male (legally a child) and his older lover (Hanna is in her mid thirties). There is far too much sex shown and not enough reading. I believe if this had been an older man shown with a fifteen year old girl there would have been more of a protest. Here their scenes are graphic and bordering on prurient.The awakening of Hanna takes place with the reading of these books and not so much the sexuality so I feel the emphasis was incorrect. Be that as it may, Michael is heartbroken when Hanna disappears. Years later, while he studies law, he goes to a trial and finds that an older Hanna is being tried for war crimes.This was a complex book and is a complex film which gives no simple answers. We cannot judge Hanna for there is a Hanna within all of us. Her empty lonely life was enriched with her exposure to literature for the first time. We understand her. We don't condone what she did as a guard but we can sympathize.Ralph Fiennes plays the grown-up Michael but with far less nuance than David Kross. I found it more than a little jolting when he appeared on screen. Ralph does pained very well indeed but his performance lacked spectrum and the emotional depth that Kross had.8 out of 10. Winslet and Kross were superb.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A reader to remember,"This is the movie that I have waited 2 and half years to see. but i must say , i am not overly satisfied nor i am utterly disappointed.The story gives us a taste of the conflicts of human moral and the repercussions of the actions of people. The man in the story was torn between them and it gives us a inside look at a dilemma that any person faces at some times of his/her life.This movie is driven by two individual performances- Kate Winslet and David Kross. Kate Winslet gave probably her best performance to date. She did complete justice to the character Hanna Schmitz. It was one of those performances that takes a character to new height. David Kross, though very young, gave an outstanding performance as young Michael Berg. Also Ralph Fiennes portrayed the despair in Michael's character brilliantly. Lena Olin ,even with a cameo role, gave a memorable performance.My only complain is that the transition of story shown in the movie was too irregular. Some times it was progressing fast and other times too slow. Also I felt, internal conflicts of Michael could have got a little more importance than it got.This movie have fulfilled my expectations and i urge everyone to watch this movie....",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Two lives played out in 20th century Berlin,"The Reader is a well acted and nicely filmed movie with scenes that take lawyer Michael Berg back from late 20th century Germany to his teenage years and then as a student in post-war Germany. As a 15 year-old youth, played by David Kross, he develops a relationship with an older, illiterate woman when she finds him very ill one rainy day in an alleyway in Berlin. Aside from a passionate relationship, graphically shown on screen, he also reads to her from some of the great classical novels. This is an unknown territory for the illiterate Hanna, whose world is now open to great writers.Ralph Fiennes is the mature Michael, who is a successful lawyer with a daughter from an earlier marriage. Facing some personal questions about his relationship with his daughter, he revisits his youth in his own memory, coming in contact with Hannah Schmitz, played by Kate Winslett. Hannah ekes out a living collecting fares from streetcar passengers.We later find out that Hanna took a job with a German company Siemens working in a death camp during World War II. There, she routinely selects prisoners for death in the gas chambers. In her trial, which Michael witnessed as a law student, it is clear that she carried out her duties without guilt. To some, this appears as evidence of her complicity in war crimes. To Michael, it must have seemed that she did not fully realize what she was doing. Neither did she know until later the impact of her relationship with Michael, who apparently was haunted by his youthful sexual liaison with Hannah. In the end, Hannah does come to terms with her past and Michael becomes her only contact with the world as he carries out her final wishes.Kate Winslett plays a lonely woman who is drawn to Michael, a talented language student. As an older, broken woman, she shows the effects of her tortured life journey. Her story makes the viewer feel a strange sympathy, while feeling repelled by her choices in life. Michael, as a youth, is made exceptionally realistic with David Cross in the role. Ralph Fiennes shows the disappointment of a middle aged man as he looks back on his life; yet he is capable of changing course.The acting of Ralph Fiennes and David Kross as Michael and Kate Winslett as Hannah Schmitz gives the movie its punch. Two people whose lives cross give shape to a complex and profound story.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Reader,"A movie about the haunting nature of regret.This is a very well developed film that builds up its story and plot slowly over time. Every aspect is clear, it's a story, like a book, slow paced but every detail is illustrated in great detail and depth. The movie is about growing up yet also growing up too soon. It's about regretting something so badly that it dominoes throughout your lifetime, you think about it day by day yet you still can't accept the fact that you did such a thing. This movie is simplistically filmed and told, yet in the vast picture of things it blooms to be a very emotionally deep and intimate film. It reveals how precious that first deep sense of connection to someone is and also conveys that when two are truly connected reminiscing one another is inevitable. Overall a great but melancholy film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two Stories Braided Together,"I hate spoilers, and so I'll avoid revealing too much. The movie is beautifully filmed and acted, and perhaps due to that acting, the character of Hannah Schmitz draws our sympathy despite....Well, she commits more than one act that some viewers find unforgivable. But for all the intensity in the love affair that consumes the first hour of the film, the movie isn't merely about the passion between Michael and Hannah, and while it is partly a coming of age story, it is also about how the two halves of the movie interpenetrate each other, just as the young Michael's rigid, very serious home life counterpoints his more joyful life at school and the past cross pollinates with the present.The second half of the movie, bridged to the first by Michael's enrollment in law school and more conventional coming-of-age experiences that begin to form him into the adult he will become--or WOULD were it not for the reentry of Hannah into his life these eight years later--communicates in flashbacks and images parallel to the first half while alluding to events that happen when Michael is an infant.Perhaps a couple of turning points in the plot are unnecessarily confusing in that twice Hannah receives a promotion at work that she refuses, albeit for a crucial thematic reason: she leaves her factory job with Siemans to work as a guard then (though revealed first in the movie) leaves her job as a tram ticket-taker to go who knows where until, eight years later, she resurfaces in the courtroom. When she has her affair with Michael she is living in the Siemans building--employee housing, I guess. Suffice to say that Siemans was her main employer before and after her tenure as a guard. At any rate, for those who know the basic historical time-line and watch the dates as they appear on the screen, these changes won't be so confusing. In the same vein, Lena Olin plays both the once young survivor who grows up to write the memoir that will expose Hannah AND, 20 years later, her NYC daughter. Giving the movie the benefit of the doubt, we can say that one of its themes is the ineluctability of the past and the quest for closure to it.Like others, I think the chemistry between Hannah/Kate and Michael/David Kross is special, and it might make all the difference in how we receive their relationship. However, some viewers will see her less as 'human' and more as anti-social, debauched, while seeing the older Michael as damaged, but that may not lessen for them the film's impact.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Outstanding performance,"Kate Winslet is outstanding in this movie. Her performance is not only the central one, but she is just phenomenal. Her performance is so great, that it almost made me rate this movie higher. But I'm not rating the acting, but the overall movie-experience that I had and what I think this movie deserves.""Deserves"" might not be the right word, because the subject matter is a very ambitious one. And just for that might be rated higher by some people. But the problem is, that apart from the different time lines, the story and the decisions the characters make, leave you indifferent most of the time. And they shouldn't, because of the nature of them. But although Kate Winslet is great and the movie begins pretty strong, it all gets deluded along the way. A shame then, but a movie that drags to long, trying to make a point that is pretty clear from the get go (or after half the movie is over).",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
better than the book,"The novel left me really completely cold, perhaps because at the time everyone was raving about it. I found it too moralizing, slow and poorly written. The most important thing about the book was the story itself. This is why I loved the film. It is very visual, I find the narrative very well transported to the visual media and the dialogues are great. I find the portrayals of young Michael sublime and Winslet is also perfect for the role of Hannah. Not being German, but speaking the language I somehow felt the whole time it's wrong the film is made in English and that it should be in German, probably also because the photography is very European. It feels like a German film which is in this case a good quality.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Wonderful film chronicling the fear, guilt and moral predicaments a young man undergoes when he thinks he's stumbled into a dream situation.","The Reader begins in 1995 as a certain Michael Berg stands in his Berlin home early on in the day. There's a disagreement with a woman who's there as well; could be anybody, and she accuses him in an angry manner that he's been distant with her, ignoring her and that he is unable to follow the simplest of commands when it is revealed he did not wake her up. She storms out, and Michael is left to contemplate what's been said. It's a relatively straight forward but extremely poignant way in which to start capturing this person's attitudes to relationships and women. Berg doesn't have much of a retort to these accusations; as the film develops, we realise the importance a mere fling had on his life, and maybe we think that he's attempting to regress back to a child-like state, when off the cusp sex with strangers drastically opened his mind. Berg thought he knew of a certain female individual from many-a year ago, while the could-be deliberate 'distancing' himself in relation to the girl in the opening keeps the anonymity prominent.The film will eventually flash back to 1958, before returning to the then-present and chronicling various incidences and the years in which these things happened; all the while building to a rather tragic denouement. Ralph Fiennes plays Michael Berg as an adult, and he is accompanied by a certain David Kross, a young German actor whose career, based on this evidence, is promising to say the least. The film is all about Berg; how one chance meeting shapes lives, his and other people's. The film, like a certain book he reads to a certain Hanna Schmitz in his youth partly entitled ""Homer's"", is an odyssey of what makes him who he and others are.It's a testament to Roger Daldry's film that The Reader can shoot all over the place in terms of jumping to specific times in people's lives spanning four different decades. The film never feels sporadic or dis-jointed, despite all this hopping about. I like The Reader a lot, predominantly because it unfolds over a number of years. It takes years to come to terms with some things; it takes years to comprehend certain other things. As a film that explores whatever friendships; relationships; acquaintancies or mutual-understandings two people of contrasting 'sorts' go through, or as a film that explores somewhat unnatural or 'taboo' understandings between two people, The Reader nails it.If one was to think of another recent example, Ang Lee's 2006 film Brokeback Mountain might count as a film that explored chance pairings, which in turn prolonged deeper feelings that rose to the surface as well as realisations of certain sensations. For Michael in The Reader, that sensation is coming-of-age. His relationship with Hanna is one that sees him engaging in rather regular sessions of a sexual nature following school; something he takes for granted; something that I think he sees as the equivalent of stumbling into a sexual fantasy, with absolutely no way of it terminating because it feels so right at that time for him. Within the actual relationship, Hanna adopts the more dominant half of the pairing. Her sheltering of Michael as he sits, helplessly, in the entrance of her apartment building coughing and shivering as a result of the driving rain, already establishes a position of power over a somewhat helpless flu victim. Once he's in better health, her ordering of him to fetch coal and to complete other such menial tasks takes over as the order of the relationship, and she dictates as to whether he will read to her before or after they engage in sexual episodes.Hanna's apartment as a cinematic space sees most of the small and un-kept location of her general living area as a location in which Michael, in his closed off Utopian place away from school and the family, can indulge in his whatever budding submissive and sexual sensations he, at that stage in his life, wants to explore. The most interesting aspect of this apartment is its bathroom area; a further space closed off within a location already established to be closed off. The bathing area comes equipped with a curtain on a rail, a physical and very symbolic object that allows the character to place a barrier between them and the rest of the living area – it is no coincidence that the two frequently find solace in this area, reading and so forth. At one point, Hanna hits Michael after a disagreement and an argument; she runs a bath; the bathing space is closed off from whatever goes on outside of it and they seem at ease again in what is some sort of recognition of the human form in its rawest form.The film develops, and Hanna cuts off contact with Michael, although they will both share a common bond between them in their time apart. Their respective journeys through life, following the affair, is all about coming to terms with the past, and accepting what you let happen. For Michael as he grows older, it is the fact he just jumped into the goings on with Hanna whereas for her, her bleak past to do with some Jewish-related atrocities that happened during The Second World War comes back to haunt. The study plays out wonderfully, with a lot of dramatic weight. As far as film-making goes, each period in history is superbly brought to life; the switching from dank, rainy evenings in the 1950s to the bright, sunny afternoons of the 1990s combine brilliantly while the young actor Kross impresses; particularly in a moment later on in which he notices Hanna after all those years and emotes the necessary emotions in his acting. As an all round piece exploring an array of various notions combining with the basics of bringing a text to life, The Reader excels.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The lady with the little dog,"(There are Spoilers) 15 year-old Michael Berg, David Cross, is suddenly taken ill on the streets of Neustadt Germany and nurses back to help by a total stranger who seems to have no one but herself to look after. The time is spring 1958 and the stranger in question is 36 year old trolley ticket stamper Hanna Schmitz, Kate Winslet.It's later when Michael was fully recovered, from Scarlett Fever, that he came back to thank Hanna for all she did for him that he started to fall in love with her. So much so that the two had a hot and sizzling love affair throughout the entire summer of 1958 until Hanna, by leaving town, broke it off. It's now eight years later, 1965, and Michael now in law collage is sent together with his fellow law students by his teacher Prof. Rohl, Bruno Ganz, to see how the law is administrated in the new German Republic. The trial that Michael is to attend and study has to do with a number of former SS women guards at the notorious Aushwitz concentration camp.To Michael's shock and utter surprise the major defendant at the trail is non other then his former lover, and the women who saved his life, Hanna Schmitz! All this is recounted in 1995 by a grown up, and now a lawyer in Berlin, Michael Berg, played by a middle age Ralph Fiennes.Michael has been haunted all his adult life in not being able to come to Hanna's aid like she did for him when she needed him most, at her trial, with vital information that would have well speared her a lifetime behind bars in a German prison. Not that Hanna was totally innocent of the charges against her in having sent a number of unfit for work women inmates to their ultimate deaths at the Auschwitz concentration camp. But it was the major charge against Hanna that she took full responsibility for, and given the harshest sentence by the court, that she in fact had nothing at all to do with. Hanna's personally writing out and signing the order that caused the deaths of hundreds of Jewish women held captive in an abandoned church.Hanna as we, as well as Michael who would read books for her, all could see very early in the movie was a functional illiterate. There was no way Hanna could write out a long two or three page order that in effect sent some 300 women prisoners to their death in a locked up church, that was later fire bombed by allied aircraft, since she couldn't even write her own name! The most shocking thing of all is that Hanna felt no remorse in the crimes that she committed during the war, she was only doing her job, but felt greatly embarrassed to the point of getting life, instead of four years, behind bars in her keeping the public from knowing that she couldn't either read or write!It took years for Michael to get up enough courage to finally go and see Hanna in prison which by then, with Michael's corresponding with her through the mail, she did teach herself to read and write. But by that time Hanna also realized what a monster she was during the war and even with her about to be paroled from prison, after some 20 years behind bars, she came to realize that there was no life left for her outside or behind prison bars.Academy Award caliber performances by both Ralph Fiennes and 18 year old David Kross as Michael Berg as well as the multi-talented Kate Winslet as the confused, in what she did in the war, and tragic, in what she ultimately did to herself,Hanna Schmitz. There's also worth mentioning in the movie actress Lena Olin playing both Rose and her daughter, some twenty years later, Ilana Mather. It was to Ilana, who's mother was the only survivor of the bombed out church, that Hanna through Michael, as her personal lawyer, left all her earthly belongings. Even though Ilana couldn't keep the money that Hanna left for her, she told Michael to donate it to a hospital burn unit, she did in fact take the colorful tea tin that it was kept in.

A good European movie,"The movie appears to be a Germany/USA production, with a British director, yet its pace and mood are absolutely European (it could have been a French movie). I won't explain the plot, as it's been described elsewhere, but I must say that it kept me engrossed.I think, however, that the silly habit of having ""foreigners"" speak in English with the accent of their countries should be eliminated: these are Germans supposedly speaking in German with each other. OK, we hear them in English, but that's for the benefit of English-speaking audiences. Why should they have a foreign accent? They're supposed to be speaking - I repeat - in their own language. This is an anglocentric quirk that should be stopped.All in all, an excellent, atmospheric movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ms. Winslet's Film,"The Reader belongs to Kate Winslet: she is quite simply superb. Everybody else, Ralph Fiennes included, slip into oblivion. The sex scenes are- how does one put it?- both erotic and disturbing. When the Kid (played by David Kross) asks her if she- a much older woman- loves him, she nods. But the nod is everything. It means no and yes and also 'are you kidding me?', all at once.Her past is demonic, no doubt, but I suspect that the viewer will (like me) come out of the movie sympathizing with her. After seeing the film, the question that perplexed me was why did she kill herself? The most obvious answer is Guilt. Yet, I can't help feeling that it might be something else also. Why for instance didn't this Guilt consume her before? And whether this Guilt also included her abandoning- not loving- the Kid, which, as we discover, leaves him permanently petrified- passive and polite? But she couldn't have known all that, could she? Perhaps- and this is the only answer I could come up with- she was ashamed of not being able to read, so ashamed in fact that she chose to spend the rest of her life in prison than let people know this. Like Salman Rushdie wrote in 'Shame', if you tell the secret, it invites shame; if you don't, you are stuck with guilt. Kate's character chooses guilt.That she couldn't read was the only secret she wished to keep as her own, having no qualms about admitting to her other more horrific misdeeds: it was indeed the defining characteristic of who she was, the one thing that made her, and what eventually becomes our key to understanding her. Ironically enough, once that secret is gone- she does eventually teach herself to read and write with the help of audio-tapes of books Ralph Fiennes' character sends her- she no longer knows her place in the world...But we can never know the answer for certain, and that is what makes The Reader such a great, beautifully multi-layered- and might I add, secretive?- film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cruel and real,"Life is not a perfect line, people make mistakes and progress. Some do think they are doing the right thing when in fact everything is wrong. This is quite often in systems under dictatorships, where the people have no right to think and to express freely their opinion. Huge mass follows what the leader is saying and some try to do his/her best for the ideas delivered by the leader. This story is about that, a person who thought to be a hero when in fact she was a monster, an illiterate monster. The plot was well conceived and the film was interesting from its beginning. The acting of Kate Winslet here was much better, in my personal opinion, than in Titanic. She was cruel and real. David Kross as young Michael Berg was also excellent showing naivety together with his thirst as a youngster with enough power to satisfy his female. The evolution of the film is unexpected, and adult Michael became a cult and discreet man with hidden suffering. Stephen Daldry, the director of the film, chose an uncommon plot and an excellent cast for a film, which is a good example that there are many real stories worth to be shown in cinema, and may serve for educating the people, particularly the young one.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Former SS Guard Seeks Redemption Through Affair With 15-Year-Old Boy  'The Reader' Review,"The Nazi Holocaust is one of the most popular subjects tackled in film, although it is worth mentioning that it is a topic that has almost never turned out a bad movie. Jakob the Liar, despite being an outstanding film, was not so well received popularly, although it's an exception to the rule. Movies that approach the issue of the Holocaust are generally made by filmmakers who understand the importance and depth of the event, and are smart enough to respect it as such, and The Reader is no exception.Directed by Stephen Daldry, who also gave us brilliant films like Billy Elliot and The Hours, it's an intricate analysis of the meaning and depth of guilt, and whether or not those who have been exposed to it and thus become infected by it are left with the option of redemption.A young man named Michael Berg falls into a case of Scarlet Fever as a teenager while riding on a trolley car in West Berlin in 1958. He gets off, overcome with nausea, and is sick in the street and pretty much helpless until a woman comes to his aid, helping him home. After being bedridden for months, he seeks her out to thank her for her help, and the two begin an affair despite a significant age difference. The affair is brief but is also Michael's first sexual experience, so he attaches great importance to her. While they are seeing each other, Michael brings over books and reads literature to her between their love-making sessions, and the two grow closer and closer until one day she vanishes without a trace or even a word.Michael learns nothing of her until nearly a decade later when, as a law student, he sees her in the courtroom being tried for her participation in the Nazi holocaust. She had joined the SS as a young woman and ultimately ended up participating in an event that left 300 Jews dead in a burning church.The story is told through the eyes of Michael's older self, played by Ralph Fiennes, and the movie is told through a series of lengthy flashbacks. It's a brilliant approach that allows us to see through Fiennes' outstanding performance the depth of the affect that Michael's involvement with Hanna has had on his life.Michael is put in a terrible position for a young man. He is at one point aware of information about Hanna that could severely alter a case that is obviously being built to frame her for deeds that she could not possibly have done, but he is torn by his emotional connection to her and his horror at discovering the darkness of her past. To speak out what he knows would have a tremendous impact on the rest of her life, but would also approach all kinds of philosophical questions that he doesn't appear ready to deal with, and would also have unknown but probably extensive affects on his own life as well.The movie is based on a book I haven't read, but my understanding is that the movie doesn't show all of the same nuances and depth that is revealed in the book, which is sort of like saying the meal you get served at a restaurant doesn't look like the picture you saw in the magazine. Of course a movie can't stay perfectly faithful to a book, but The Reader clearly gets the important meaning across, although the last third at some points feels like it's being rushed along. The first hour of the film is pretty powerful, but it leaves a feel that the movie thinks it's told most of its story by the end and should kind of hurry things along.Nevertheless, I appreciate that even though it presents as one of its main characters a woman who participated in sending Jews to their deaths at Auschwitz, it neither demonizes her nor does it attempt to absolve her of her past and ask us to root for her freedom. She has committed atrocious acts that have been buried for years, and the movie supports the theory that people who do such things should not be allowed a clean slate just by the realization and acceptance that what they did was wrong.But don't worry, I didn't just spoil anything about the plot, because this is not a legal thriller. It's a moral drama with two main characters who are in two very different but very deep kinds of distress, and it is how they handle that distress that pushes the story along and makes it work. It's a story about the real world that takes place in the real world, not a story about the real world that takes place in Hollywood.Had it been the latter, it would have been a very, very different movie which, by the way, would never have been nominated for any Oscars. Isn't it strange how that works?",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Spectacular.,"I've always been a huge Kate Winslet fan. I think she's beautiful and an amazing actress. I've always been wanting to watch The Reader, but never got the chance to. It recently came out on Amazon Prime, so I decided to watch it.I don't want to give too much about the plot away. So I'm just going to say that this movie is about the love and attraction of a mysterious older women and a teenage boy. Their love only lasts about a summer, but it's a love that neither of them will ever forget. The teenage boy begins eventually finds out the older womens dark secrets...This movie made me feel everything that the characters were feeling: Love, Guilt, Compassion.

Life should be useful for us and others,"This story is the best example to explain that any movement in this world has a reaction or an invoice to pay, either for good or bad everything is resolved in this life. Hanna Schmitz, representing all the people who have been wrong in this life, some under the influence of others, life circumstance, or simply born at the time and wrong place. But nothing will excuse your actions and if your actions harm others, you must know that sooner or later a big bill with interest and penalties, must confront. It is a narrative that leads us to reflect on thousands of stocks that are committed in life that hurt others (children abandoned, killing, lying, stealing, emotional abuse, etc.) sooner or later will come a justice that you do know you you're wrong. Hanna was able to accept and face their responsibility, for her life was so short that the lesson is for those who are left, a lesson from the past to the present. We live in an ecstasy that makes us forget the true meaning of this gift, and this story remind us that perhaps no other life and we must be useful for us and for others.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Kate Winslet's best performance ever.,"The Reader is a deep, emotionally wrenching drama. Kate Winslet gives a superb performance, as Hannah Schmitz. Hannah had participated in heinous crimes against Jews, during World War II. Hannah is lonely, and leads an isolated life. She has no family, friends, or companions. After the war ends, Hannah is living alone and working in Berlin, Germany.One miserably rainy day in 1958 Berlin, 15-year-old Michael Berg becomes sick, while coming home from school. Hannah happens to spot Michael vomiting, outside of her apartment building. She helps Micheal clean-up, and then sends him home. Michael is later diagnosed with Scarlet Fever, and has to stay in bed for weeks, to fully recover.Michael returns to see Hannah after his convalescence, bringing her flowers to thank her. He spots Hannah putting a stocking on her bare leg, as he's leaving. Hannah sees him ogling her. Hannah is in her 30s. And she's seen as being wise and worldly, by the naive Micheal.Next time that Micheal returns to Hannah's, she asks him to do some chores. When working, Michael gets filthy, and Hannah insists that he bathe, before he leaves. While Micheal is in the tub, Hannah slips quietly into the bathroom. She strips naked, and slyly seduces Micheal, right then and there. It's the start of a summer affair between them.During their time together, Hannah insists the Michael read a variety of literature, poems, and prose to her. Hannah cannot read herself. And she comes to rely on Michael's readings, to expand her understanding of the world, as well as for own pleasure. By the end of the summer of '58, the affair between Hannah and Michael ends. Michael then attends law school, to pursue a law career.As fate would have it, Hannah is caught and tried for her participation in Nazi war crimes. Michael is a part of the trial, as a budding lawyer. He had no idea that Hannah could be capable of such vicious acts. It's all a devastating revelation for Micheal, and he tries to figure out how to handle it.As the years pass, Michael continues to be entwined in Hannah's life, even after she's sentenced to prison, and he grows up and marries someone else. Micheal just can't abandon Hannah, and this leads to his realization, of how deep his feelings are for her. For Micheal, this leads ultimately to tragic heartbreak.This film belongs to Kate Winslet, who should win an Oscar. Ralph Fiennes as the adult Micheal Berg, is good, but not great. He seems to be trying too hard, to convey sorrowful angst. David Kross plays the young Micheal Berg, and his performance shows an incredible emotional fluency. He too, should win an Oscar.The bleak, murky city streets of Berlin, set the emotional tone for the movie. There's always a feeling of heavy gloom, running throughout the course of this film. The racy sex scenes between Hannah and young Michael, manage to temporarily jolt the viewer out of the somber mood that cloaks the film. The full-frontal nude scenes of young Micheal, are alarming though, especially since he's a minor. The producers probably thought that explicit male nudity is hip. It just winds up being tasteless and seedy, in this film.The main reason to view this film, is Kate Winslet. This has got to be the best performance, of her already stellar career. The movie is depressing overall. But Kate's performance alone, makes seeing this film worthwhile.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Art cinema lite,"The sure sign of a lazy, unimaginative film maker is their compulsion to trowel on layer after layer of syrupy music at crucial scenes, instructing us what we re supposed to feel. Which this does throughout its 120 minutes.This is one for the would be art house crowd, people who want to feel they ve seen a quality film, without having to make any intellectual effort or find themselves challenged in any way, shape or form.Director Stephen Daldry pulls the same trick he did with Billy Elliott. That film presented elements of gritty northern British realism but filtered everything controversial or meaningful out, leaving us with empty images.This film ticks all the boxes with high production values, sumptuous cinematography but makes the retrogressive step of having its actors speak with German accents. We're thus treated to Kate Winslett as ze stereotypical bad German who must obey zer orderz.An issue around how empathy and imagination, being able to imagine yourself in someone elses shoes, can be tied in with literature, being able to read...these issues are never explored. The act of reading, of imagining. If you are illiterate, as is Kate Winslett's character, does this mean your thought processes are more concrete, that you are more susceptible to carry out the kind of atrocities perpetrated by Hannah? Because you have limited capacities of imagining?A film on this subject must require more effort on the part of the viewer.

A Slow & Yet Captivating Drama..,"Kate Winslet stars as the main lead in this film about a woman who is accused of involved in the Holocaust. From the very beginning Kate steals the show with her remarkable dedication towards her character. She embarks on an affair with a boy (David Cross) half her age. The boy falls hopelessly in love with her while she looks occupied with something (that is revealed in the second half). The second half is marked by a gripping courtroom drama where Kate is convicted. Several years later, the boy who has now grown into a man (Ralph Fiennes)finds out about Kate & starts sending her tapes about books she loved to be read to.Now, its not a story which keeps you guessing all the time. Rather the director takes his own sweet time to establish the love story. Yet, there is something about this slow drama that keeps you hooked during most part of the film. The first rate performances by its main leads (the boy & Kate) hold the film together. Young Michael excels in portraying the depression he goes through when Kate is going through the trial. In the end, the story seems a bit dragged. Ralph looks too subdued & one doesn't quiet understand his indifferent attitude towards Kate when he meets her in person. All in all, the film's execution is quiet compelling & it stays on with you for quiet some time.Any hiccups? Well, the first half is too graphic to the extent that it starts looking like a soft porn film. It also takes your attention away from the main topic of the film. But, the second half packs enough punch & makes up for this eroticism.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fine acting, excellent screenplay, and a quite compelling story...","Stephen Daldry's THE READER is another fine showcase of the acting range of Kate Winslet. Her performance here is breathtakingly wonderful as she manages to portray one of the most complex cinematic characters of 2008 in fine fashion. It is no real wonder she won the (long-overdue) Oscar for Lead Actress, but in my opinion, the award would have probably been more suited for her much under-appreciated work in the widely snubbed-for-no-real-reason REVOLUTIONARY ROAD.THE READER's nomination for Best Picture came as a bit of a surprise but upon closer inspection one would realise that the direction, screenplay, and story were simply top-notch. Some credit must also go to young David Kross who performed his role admirably well. Ralph Fiennes is also as solid and reliable as ever.My only real problem with THE READER was the way in which the story was told; in my opinion, there was no real need for the non-chronological, fragmented approach, as it would have been just as effective (and less annoying) if it was told in a more straightforward manner. Moreover, the film starts to lose its initial appeal after the first 2/3.While the events that occur in the last third of the film are somewhat important, they do little to progress the story. What was done in 35 minutes could have been achieved in about 15-20.THE READER is a rare gem of a Motion Picture. Worth watching even if it's only for Kate Winslet's stunning performance. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 250 at 232. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Intelligent and thought provoking,"The Reader is a mature, intelligent and thought provoking film that is well made, well paced and well acted.Set in Germany, it tells the story of Michael Berg, who (in his late teens in the late 1950s) has a sexual coming of age when by chance he meets Hanna Schmitz - a woman in her 30s. When eventually their physical relationship ends, they meet again some years later at a legal trial where Hanna is a defendant accused of Nazi war crimes.Although the film explores Hanna's part in the Holocaust, and raises questions about whether she was guilty or simply following orders, the film's main focus is on the personal relationship between Hannah and Michael. The story continues post trial as far as the 1990s, and we see how the significant emotional effects of Hannah and Michael on each other dramatically effects their lives.Ultimately the film poses deep questions about love, loyalty, morality and guilt. If you discover the person you love has a terrible secret or dark past, what is the right thing to do? How should you feel? How do you cope? Here it is set in post-war Germany, but that setting is almost incidental - a similar emotional turmoil might arise in many other situations.The great skill of this film is in raising that question, but leaving the answer hanging. At no stage does the film overtly encourage us to root for, or feel sympathy for, any of the main characters. It cleverly reveals the many deep layers of Michael and Hanna and leaves us to judge and feel for ourselves. The film stayed with me for several days after I watched it; I dissected Michael and Hanna's lives, went over various clues laid down in the film, and willingly analysed their characters.Michael is played in later adult life by Ralph Fiennes, and in his younger life by German actor David Kross. Both are excellent. Hannah - both younger and older - is played by Kate Winslet, who gives an exceptional performance. Her character is particularly complex and she delivers the role brilliantly.I highly recommend this as an intelligent and thought provoking film, especially if you enjoy the type of film where you are invited to really think deeply about the lives and inner emotions of the main characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Implausible Tedious Mess,"Warning: SpoilersI just do not get it. Apparently it is more shameful for the character Hanna to admit to being illiterate than to have been complicit in the murder of several hundred human beings. Are we supposed to feel sorry for Hanna? That poor little Nazi it wasn't her fault she didn't realise that torturing people was naughty because she couldn't read. Is that what it was about? Because that's what I took from it. The affair between Hanna and Michael also feels unbelievable to me. Hanna's character is colder than a snowman. Even without knowing she is a Nazi Michael would surely have guessed that there was something up with her. If he was just after sex then maybe it is a feasible pairing - a horny teenager and a physically pleasing older woman - I get that. However, despite Hanna's frosty disposition and anger management issues Michael bafflingly seems to care about her. None of it seems remotely plausible to me.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
What Would Any One of Us Have Done If We Were Germans During Hitler's Rise?,"In this romantic drama, a young German, who has information that might prove the partial innocence of a woman about to be sentenced to life in prison, keeps it hidden. He hasn't the courage to reveal his affair with this woman to anyone outside of the two of them. By making this decision, he shifts the film's focus from the subject of German guilt about the Holocaust and turns it on the human race in general. The story means his choice as the key to its significance, but most of us American viewers will resolve that the movie is about the war crimes of the Nazis and their reaction by post-war German generations. Though I have always been interested in the coping post-WWII societies who committed the most pivotal atrocities of the war, namely Germany and Japan, that's not what the film meant to me. I found Kate Winslet's performance, and frankly her nude beauty, entranced me, and I was entrenched in a sort of existential concern for the well-laid plot in terms of how it affected her.This wise historical psychological drama's basic premise is a sexual relationship between Winslet, a mysterious and emotionally withholding woman in her mid-30s, and a 15-year- old boy played by David Kross. Whether or not such things are wrong, which really they aren't, or socially illicit, which they generally are, is not concerned here. The only thing that matters to the kid being intensely absorbed in the discovery of his sexuality. We are unsure of what matters to her, and perhaps she is, too, but the reality is there. She is aloof yet demanding with sex, it being obvious to her that a 15-year-old virgin would have absolutely no problem with that, but it seems to care more that he read to her. The film's three-time Oscar-nominated, BAFTA- and Tony-winning director Stephen Daldry depicts them almost entirely through nudity because when they are together, they are about nothing else.It happens, and the story, to me, is about the surprise life holds for a transitory relationship of both intense passion and total anonymity, how it links her earlier life and his later one. It is told in a flashback format and powerfully acted by Winslet and Kross, with Ralph Fiennes coldly enigmatic as the elder version of the character. The film is marketed as being as if Fiennes is the male lead, but Winslet and Kross are the core essence of the movie. This digital feature, only Daldry's third film and yet his third critical success, begins with Fiennes parting awkwardly with a one-night stand before watching an S-Bahn pass by outside, which leads us to flash back to another tram in 1958 Neustadt. An unhappy-looking teenaged Kross gets off but wanders around the streets. The following is shot almost entirely in shadows and silhouettes: He finally pauses in the entryway of a nearby apartment building where he starts to vomit. The tram conductor, a woman, yes, her, comes by and coldly, pragmatically helps him.Winslet's character, who puts up a dominant, almost masculine, front, is indirectly deconstructed by not only a shocked Kross but characters who truly haven't met her before the surprising revelation about her. They get nowhere. One can't forgive what we learn she's done, but is that all there is to her? There is pressure in all societies to do what everyone else is doing, pressure much bigger than any single society. What would we have done if we were Germans during Hitler's rise? If we had been Jewish, we would've tried to flee, and we'd either be lucky or not so much. But if we weren't? Bernhard Schlink's story is a realization that many people are like these two characters, and nearly all of us have secrets that we would do unforgivable things to keep.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

All three main actors are phenomenal. I could rave about each of their performances in detail, but for one example, I was so moved by Ralph Fiennes' physically closing in on himself when he was at his lowest- as if reverting to this boyish pain/soothing. He and Kross(and whoever else in the making) worked so hard, and succeeded, in truly being one. Kate Winslet is inarguably one of the best actors alive(as is Fiennes), and she really nails this performance.

Extraordinary adaptation of Bernhard Schlink's masterpiece (one of my favorite books),"Delightful David Kross, stunning... no, STUNNING Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes, solid and elegant as usual. Though filled with beautiful and tasteful images of sexuality, ""The Reader"" is really about feelings of guilt and shame. For most of his movie director wants us to identify with Michael, innocent who is also guilty. Michael is ashamed of associating with Hanna and also intensely ashamed of his shame. Director repeatedly makes his point that guilty are also innocent and innocent are also guilty. During trial Hanna is so ashamed of being illiterate that she accepts life sentence. And Michael is so ashamed of his relationship with her that he does not inform court that she is illiterate, that she could not have written that document she is charged with. Because of his inaction Michael is then overcome with guilt for not having helped Hanna, who is now both perpetrator and victim. Mainly because Michael did not provide evidence that would have shortened her prison term and did not give her support that might have avoided her suicide. Hanna is also victimized by other defendants during trial. Michael then tries to do right by flying to New York to visit surviving daughter of one of Hannah's victims played by fabulously convincing Lena Olin. He asks her to take Hannah's money or at least give advice about how to use it but daughter refuses. She harshly rejects any involvement in Hannah's affairs not allowing even little forgiveness. I found interesting Hanna's poverty compared to riches of Olin's character's New York apartment. But there is no mention of it in Schlink's book... My guess is that director was trying to stir guilt in his audience. Perhaps he was trying to turn our sympathy from daughter encouraging us to be more forgiving of Hanna than daughter was.

I certainly had no issues with the actors, as a matter of fact, I could not help but sometimes feel that they were too good for this movie, as the amount of raw emotion Kate Winslet puts in to this Oscar winning performances is stunning for a film that gives her so little to work with. It is also a pleasure, as always, to watch Ralph Fiennes perform.The characters are all unlikeable, none of them really having any likability to them, they do not have definable traits. Michael Berg is the main character that guides this story, but there is not a single thing about this two dimensional being. He is established at the beginning as a man who had an affair, and there is not much scope put in to him beyond that, making it almost impossible to evoke any sort of compassion for his character, and even Hanna never truly grabbed me.The film also paints the Holocaust in a very strange light. While it is not idolising it in any way, it does not create an image of how horrendous these events were either. The director seemed to try his best to shed some light on these events, which just makes it unsettling, as we all know there is no positive outcome.Well acted, but nothing more. Poor characters and a disengaging story, I expected so much more from the Reader and was inevitably let down, I would advise giving it a miss.A man reminisces on his affair with a woman who has a much darker secret.Best Performance: Kate Winslet",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good movie,"The innocence of the youth, a middle class boy, got stolen from an ex SS and getting compared of such victims from war, the message of the director I got: doesn't exist an innocence more worthy than others. Also between this, there is the strenght of the love from the boy, keep look for the woman, a pure love, and the impossibility to accept to were in love with a person that many could called her a '' monster''. I think in this movie the protagonist get in different states of the war , but this time the war is inside in himself, '' young and strong'' boy get sick, that also could be compared the crisis in Germany before Hitler, the boy get helped from an austerithy woman, it could also rappresent the appear of Hitler, he wants thanks her,then fall in love of her, and becoming ''blind'' in front the evidence of the evil intentions of the woman, she disappear, he see her after many years during a process, and he find out that he was a victim , but also partner of the evil. He tried to think of her as an innocent, and feel less guilty, but the only realization that be in love it's human, and mistake too could really get him relieved. This woman's ignorance is what made her. No thoughts, bring her to no regret , no think about what she has done. To break this the protagonist gift her the ability to read, and write, breaking the ignorance came the awareness , this without possibility to fix. So the death. To the protagonist remain the memory and story to tell. In the end he doesn't and has not to forget. As a victim he will remember and tell it to the daughter.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Reader Can Be Slow, But Has Excellent Acting","The film smacks us right away as a series of moral dilemmas. Certainly contrived by author Bernhard Schlink, whose original original The Reader was an international bestseller. Schlink, a lawyer/judge who usually writes detective stories. He broke with his writing and took on the novel which becomes a meditation on Nazism and takes on the denial of the surviving participants and the incomprehension of Germans like Michael who were born in the aftermath. The questions are fair onesthat perhaps resonate more deeply in the 21st Century. What of the role of guilt in victims, guilt of the perpetrators, guilt of the individuals and the collective. What of the justice, the forgiveness, redemption and of course, literacy and the role in Western thought.All of this is a pretty heady stuff for any film to take on its shoulders. The director, Stephen Daldry (The Hours) pulls all of this together with help from David Hare's screenplay and the remarkable cinematography of Roger Deakins together with a sensitive score by Nico Muhly, this is indeed rarefied film-making.The story pulls us into post-WWII Germany when teenager Michael Berg (David Cross) becomes ill and is helped home by Hanna, a stranger twice his age (Kate Winslet). Naturally, when Michael recovers from scarlet fever and seeks out his healer Hanna to thank her, the two become passionate. David Kross is amazing as the young Michael. Some say the key role in the film. As the two are quickly drawn into this passionate but secretive affair, Michael discovers that Hanna loves being read to and their physical relationship deepens. Despite their intense bond, Hanna mysteriously disappears one day. Michael is left heartbroken. Eight years later, while Michael is a law student observing the Nazi war crime trials, he is stunned to find Hanna - this time as a defendant in the courtroom. As Hanna's past is revealed, Michael uncovers a deep secret that will impact both of their lives. The Reader is a wonderful story.Kate Winslet is magnificent, especially her scenes with the wonderful David Kross are filled with compelling, contradictory and totally believable undertones. I think the problems with the film on the shoulders of director Stephen Daldry. Some of the scenes are confusing and painfully long with little point. His other films like ""Billy Elliot"" and ""The Hours"" have some of the same issues with long drawn out scenes. Ralph Fiennes who I always find to be amazing in everything he does, has some wonderful moments with Winslet and they are able to keep the mood almost haunting of what could have been.In the end we are left with a good movie, but one that could have been better. The acting is superb with some surprising feelings. The Oscar nomination will find this movie an audience that it might not have found otherwise, ***/**** . The posters for the film are all designed the same way with snippets of the face thing either done on small or large scale. Clean lines give it a classic look, but I think they could have gone retro WWII with it and done a better job and pulled more audiences to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
No Easy Answers,"The Reader is the best kind of movie, because it engages the mind with puzzling and yet interesting ambiguity. Daldry, the director and Schlink, the author, leave their intentions not so much transparent, as invisible. That is refreshing, when the story involves places and events which usually are presented to illicit one reaction from an audience. That's not the case here; and you may find yourself thinking about the film for weeks after seeing it. Essentially the movie is about forgiveness of others and of ourselves. In this scenario, everyone is revealed to have something to feel guilty about. But because the filmmaker and author present so many facets of the story, no heroes or villains emerge. Is Winslet's character guilty or the worst kind of victim? What kind of background did she have that left her unable to read and a slave to authority? It's a tribute to Winslet that we care so much about her character's back story. Fiennes' character could be equally indictable on his failure to divulge key evidence in the trial, despite his being an aspiring lawyer. Even Lena Olin's saintly writer is not shown to be without taint in a scene that shows her smugly living on her profits from the stories of the murdered. The blurring of right and wrong is what makes this movie so much better than typical Oscar contenders.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Exciting reviews!,"Sat through it, catching short periods of snooze time, and woke up near the end, over at last.

Why did they make Kate Winslet so plain and unlikable?,"This grossly overrated and dull film is awful.Very few women in their thirties choose to have sex with 15-year-old boys. Why didn't the writers make Michael a few years older, to make the relationship believable?Why was Kate Winslet given a makeunder to make her so plain? Why did the writers give her a cold, aloof, unlikeable personality? Why would Michael be attracted to someone like that? She should have been beautiful, seductive, romantic, warm, loving, caring etc. - so that the audience would like her and believe the attraction that Michael has for her.The trial is stupid. The idea that Hanna would rather serve a much longer sentence because she's too ashamed to admit that, at the time of the crime, she was illiterate - is ridiculous. No matter how much shame there was to being unable to read, it was tiny in comparison to being a mass murderer. In any case, it would still have clearly been a mass murder of civilians even if you couldn't read, so she's still guilty. The film doesn't show any of the mass murder in question, which is yet another deficiency the film has.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Exit Material.,"It had been awhile since I've been this disappointed, but I left the movie's credits profoundly disgusted. The material is not only weak, but practically void. It stands non-chalant, sourcing it's story as it has a bigger message, but the mix poured with unaesthetic, cold, unimportant flows of sex scenes that can't even pull reactions other than boredom, Winslet snugged on make up without feeling the character, delivering her speech without a change in her blank expression; with tears that seem to mechanical and looks that seem to disgusting.It has the disadvantage of also being talked in English, set upon Nazi Germany, a completely detachment between Michael Berg grown and youth, and lines and subplots too predictable to be accounted as realistic or even entertaining.Many movies were, are and will be made about the Second War World. It has lots of material: ""Letters of Iwo Jima"" did beautifully in telling hell over the Japanese side. ""The Pianist"" cut crude into a fight for survival keeping morals. Even ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" did a perfect examination of the disgusting wheels of Nazi officers in trial.But ""The Reader"" has nothing to give to this big names. It is big, it is boasted enormously, it has colours and environment, but lacks depth as rarely seen in films with this subject.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Entertains but nothing new about it, (pretentious).","There were certain moments while watching this film, where I couldn't stop thinking ''Oh, God really?''. 
Since the first minutes in, you can notice the rush: three minutes and you have the first sex scene, and twenty minutes after that, you begin with the breaking-up part. The way scenes are sequenced don't let you enjoy them not even a little bit. This broken way to tell the story, ruins everything else, that only can be saved by Winslet's performance. 
Also, the absurdity of dialogs, (sometimes turning a little cringy to hear the whole conversation), can't just get away.
I suppose people actually like The Reader, because it ''moves'' with a 'human topic' that can't be forgotten, but there's a moment after you hear it that much in movies, books and everything else, that you have to look beyond it: you try to find structure, form and technique. This movie doesn't work due to its lack of proper ways to be narrated and its pretentious 'pseudo-philosophical' exagerations about important topics like guilt and moral values, just far away from true human nature and compassion; I talk about the last scene when the writer/jew/surviver says the horrors that happened to the Jewish people were the worst thing that has happened ever, (but logically, that's not true, people still suffer and had suffered before all along human history, and giving that importance to this, avoids total human empathy, not even close to reality).I read somewhere that this movie is actually a good film-adaptation of the book, so I can't imagine how painfully must be to read it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sex and Nazi history, the Reader as a film not suitable for the young?!","The film based on the book of the Reader by Bernhard Schlink succeeds in having a professional cast with emotional and open actors, especially Kate Winslet, who plays the character of Hanna.Also, the film becomes very lively due to many dynamic transitions and thus can be considered quite solid in terms of production.However, due to the lack of a narrator, the plot is very complex and difficult to follow. Also, many changes were made from the book to compensate for the lack of a narrator.In addition, I personally found the film relatively boring, which made it difficult to really concentrate on the subject.Therefore, despite the high level of professionalism in the cast, I cannot recommend the film if you are not a fan of more abstract romantic dramas.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Weak script, strong acting","If you're a fan of Kate Winslet and want to watch the film that won her her Oscar, and you're old enough to handle some very uncomfortable sex scenes, go out and rent The Reader. If you're not old enough, or you prefer well-acted movies where everyone keeps his and her clothes on, rent Labor Day instead for a great Kate Winslet performance.David Kross stars as a fifteen-year-old boy in post-war Germany who enters into a relationship with the much older, mysterious Kate Winslet after a chance encounter. While it's very clear that David's interest is solely the interest of any hormone-raging teenager who gets within a three-foot radius of any woman, it never explains Kate's interest. On a physical level, why is she attracted to someone who, five years earlier, was in grade school? On an emotional level, why does she want to permanently damage a young boy's mind and future relationships? In their meet-cute, she helps walk him home after he's ill on the street. Leading up to their first explicit encounter, he helps her with a chore and gets his face dirty; she insists he take off all his clothes and have a bath. The set-up makes no sense, and if you're looking at the film through a lens concerned with child abuse, Kate is clearly guilty.A good portion of the movie details Kate and David's sexual relationship, but as the film starts with Ralph Fiennes reflecting on his youth, the audience is left to hope there's a little more to the story. The plot does progress, and if you look up the film online you'll find out what happens in the first sentence of description. If you want to be surprised, just rent the movie without knowing anything about it.While the performances of the lead actors are very good, the script is surprisingly weak. There's a shocking lack of character development than not only leaves the audiences wondering why they made their choices, but makes the main points of the plot unbelievable. I can only imagine Kate Winslet working through her script, exclaiming, ""She does what? But why?"" with no one to help her. Given what she had to work with, she did a very good job.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to graphic nudity, graphic sex scenes, and uncomfortable scenes involving a young boy, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
I am still cringing,"The Reader is part of a rare canon of films, in my opinion, that are bad for wholly uncommon reasons. At a glance, it is a ""good"" film. It passes every sniff test of being so. It was nominated for five major Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actress, Cinematography, Screenplay). But it only holds a meh Rotten Tomatoes rating (63%). It was a definitive box office success but not a blockbuster. It has most likely avoided the posthumous scrutiny a film like 2004's Crash has because it did not take home the top prize at the Academy Awards (Slumdog Millionaire); it won just a single golden statue (Winslett).But do not be mistaken, this film is atrocious. It's of an age of cinema that has mostly died off, thank god. At least it feels like this kind of badly overwrought, force-fed romantic, stupidly over-indulgent period piece has gone by the wayside (they at least don't seem to automatically cleanup during awards season).Perhaps this is all a little too harsh. What's the harm in making a super glossy version of a Lifetime Movie of the Week with A-list actors once in awhile? Well the answer to that is twofold: nazis and statutory rape. Both featured prominently!There's no real good way to spin this, just as there is no real way not to cringe when watching it. This film bounces back and forth and all over the course of almost 40 years. It's a tired trope, and messily done here. As I write this and we approach the new decade (2020), one can only say about The Reader (2008) is that... it exists. Twelve years have passed, and it still exists.

I certainly wouldn't rank this as one of the better films of 2008.It is always a pleasure to see the great Bruno Ganz work. Here he plays the kid's law professor who provides some life advice, which the kid basically ignores. Mr. Ganz was truly spectacular as Hitler in ""Downfall"".Not much else to say as the courtroom drama held little suspense and the love scenes seemed to go over the top in a meager attempt to give some depth to the film.

Her performance was not bad enough to unbalance the film but she really was not a great choice for the main part.Crucially the plot needed her to mirror the complexity of the situation.Instead her German accent was weak, her range was limited and made it impossible to have any empathy for her.For the love story of the film to make any sense she need to be erotic and show love for Michael.

Kate Winslet could do better,"The reader, the movie (by Nico Keuning)It's quite normal to make a film in the slipstream of the success of a bestseller. The reader is one of the many examples. It's based on the novel Der Vorleser (1995) of Bernard Schlink. Reality is not of any importance. Neither in a book nor in a picture. Imagination, that's what it's all about. But there must be something to believe in. And that's exactly what lacks in The reader.The Reader is a cheap story, based on the planned success of the German past: the controversial contents of sexual intercourse of an elder woman with a young schoolboy (which is in The Graduate, normal and hilarious) and Auschwitz. With these two ingredients the film can't go wrong, as far as success is concerned. But what about the story? Predictable and in veracious. That she is a illiterate is quite obvious from the beginning, but the director (Stephen Daldry) shows us this feature of her in a educational sequence of flash backs during the process concerning her behavior as a simple guard in Auschwitz where she childishly obeyed the rule Befehl ist Befehl.How can such a woman appreciate the world literature, which is read to her by the scholar? How is it possible that a 'reader' like she is, never during her live escaped from illiteracy? The film is disappointing and confusing.And, Hollywood, please don't reward actrices any longer with an Oscar when they play the role of an older woman! It's too easy and not persuasive.

He loved Hanna when he was 15, but in the late part of the story, he takes a load on his mind about her but somewhat halfway to my eyes. I am disappointed though the story and pictures are great.",,Anonymous,Romance
A truly mesmerising film,"This film is about a young boy who has a sexual relationship with an older woman in the post war Germany. He stumbles upon a secret about her while attending a trial as a part of the law class.""The Reader"" is truly mesmerising. The plot is touching and developed well. I think it is the right pace for tension and emotions to develop. A lot of emotions are unsaid, but has to be felt by the viewers. This is the beauty of ""The Reader"", because to truly appreciate this piece of work, you have to be connected to it, to feel it and to be immersed in the world of Hannah and Michael. With top notch acting by Kate Winslet, David Kross and Ralph Fiennes, anyone would be touched by their unfortunate circumstances.Despite all the gloom and guilt and unfinished business, ""The Reader"" is a highly enjoyable and satisfying film.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Age, Sex, Education, World War and Eternal Love",The reader shows a kind of love which sets off of just physical attraction but grows into an intense emotion for a lifetime..I would say it's a little heavy dose of nudity to start the movie with but how the director has connected all those moments to memories in the later part of the movie is simply moving. I am sure the novel itself must be great second half read but here the real winner on screen is Ralph Fiennes even though Kate claimed most of the popularity from the movie. This performance of Ralph reminds you of another of his intense romantic drama movie The English Patient. The classroom discussions are also a good addition to the movie since they don't take movie off the track but instead help moving it forward.Another thing I noticed was that Kate's body language or dialogue delivery speed did not match that well with her makeup (aged around 60-70 years) towards the movie's end. Also the movie could have been shortened by 10 minutes or so by going a little easy on nudity but on the whole a good quality movie and moving too.,,Anonymous,Romance
"Secrets, sex and death","People will think The Reader is another holocaust story. Granted some areas of this film are based around it but it is the deeper subtext of this film and the questions it asks us that take it in another direction entirely. This film intends to show that not everyone involved was a monster.We start with a middle aged Michael (Ralph Fiennes) preparing to meet with his daughter. He seems to be holding a secret. A secret he takes us on in his mind. We transport back to the fifties where Michael (now played by David Kroos) is eighteen and throwing up in the street. He is helped by a thirty year old woman, Hanna Schmitz (Winslet) who cleans up his mess and gets him home. When Michael is finally better he visits Hanna with a bunch of flowers to say thank you. Within minutes he realises that she is a secretive woman albeit seductive and when he spots her getting changed he finds himself swelling up and leaving. Of course he goes back, Hanna has left a lasting impression in a matter of minutes and upon his arrival an affair triggers. One which must be kept secret. Hanna blows hot and cold with a young naïve Michael, where all he wants to do is fall in love she seems to just want sex. She shows her distance when it takes the third time they sleep together before she tells him her name. As well as sex Hanna asks Michael to read to her, refusing to read anything himself. Over a summer the couple hold a steamy affair involving reading and sex, distancing Michael from the things an eighteen year old should be doing. Hanna begins to realise this and disappears leaving Michael distraught and wandering who this woman really was.Years later he is attending law school. The class sit in on a war crime trial of six guards who would select people for death at Auschwitz. To Michael's horror he sees that Hanna is one of the guards on trial and that her distance and secrets were of her past but that isn't entirely accurate. Eventually Michael works out her secret and knowing it could help her in the trial he must decide whether this secret will bring justice to her victims.Michael still beats himself up over his choices and still in his fifties he finds himself writing and taping himself reading books for Hanna's benefit as she rots in prison. He can't seem to see evil in her.The film ranges from a love story, to a political drama, to a war-crime holocaust piece to a non linear grudge story. It never seems to really settle on a genre and as we go through we change into different tones. The film starts great and continues well when we find out Hanna's secret. Although the secret becomes a twist to the film it seems to be very minimal for the circumstances this woman finds herself in. The secret could lighten her sentencing but instead she would rather not be ashamed. The only way I can see through this is as if she realises the pain she has caused and believes she should be punished.The Reader does show the holocaust in a different way. We see it from this woman who is not particularly evil but of one following orders and her job. She is deemed as bad as every other soldier involved and that's where the differences is, we strangely sympathise with her when really we shouldn't. She even says to the judge, 'what would you have done?', when he asks if she was involved in the selection of people next in line for the chamber. Not giving her an excuse but it shows how several people chose to dust the occurrences under the carpet in order to continue with life.Many will find this a little off putting as no one wants to give sympathy to the criminals during the holocaust but the film has a lot of subtext which go deeper. It's all about secrets. The affair is a secret for starters, at only eighteen Michael can't tell his parents he is sleeping with a thirty year old woman and it is something she also wants to keep hidden. Also the secret which he knows can get her off the hook. Does he reveal it or doesn't he? The film is about false love, false hope and choices. The choices we make that define a person and a generation and this film shows how different generations attempt to understand each other.The acting is great, the young Kroos and Winslet hold great chemistry with an erratic relationship and Ralph Fiennes comes in to add an emotional edge in the last forty minutes. His first meet with Winslet after years is sad and perfectly acted from both parties. The cinematography is realistic and believable and really shows a post war Germany as they attempt to cover the cracks and forget the horrific past. I would have liked to have seen it told more linear however as at times it became confusing.Not the best post war Germany film to be released and also not the best holocaust film but it does force you to ask different questions towards what went on in these times and although it will not change anyone's opinion on what actually happened it may make you start thinking about it much deeper than you did before.",,Anonymous,Romance
Leafes,"An adaptation. Like second part of a novel. The scenes, the dialogs, the feelings are same. But option for Kate Winslet and Ralph Fienes makes to born new nuances. Few scenes and the art to explore the deep spaces of writing. Exploration of love and shadows of past, fragility and gloomy story, the novel, the film as parts of definition for crumbs of two existences in which the soul translate lost words. It is difficult to define the whigs of story. Or essence of lives and connections. It is , in same time, picture of a teenage adventure and waves of adult memories. Description of forms for a bleak world . Sketches of guilty and capitulation. Leafs of past as ingredients of present. And letters of escape. As bones of a very long silence.",,Anonymous,Romance
the reader,"""The Reader"" movie is a sad story about the past generation(Hana) and the young man (Micheal). It became the Oscar awarded movie, The Reader. The sad story really touched. The more i kept watching, the more tears flowed on my face. At first, i thought it was too sexually contented. However, i realized there were a lot of things that i acknowledged that movie. Self-esteem, lust, being ashamed, forgiveness, empathy, massive massacres, Holocaust, the winter death march, etc.After a lot of year, Micheal remind the his past with Hana, so he still remembers he was the reader for her. So he starts recording many books and sends it to her. When i saw this part, i am crying. Crying for their past, crying for Hana because she missed a lot of things in her life for one reason: she doesn't know how to read.",,Anonymous,Romance
admirable   work,"the cast. and the performances. the inspired adaptation. the homage to the books. the science to define the spirit of a period, the special friendship, the sexuality and the moral duties. a beautiful film for the flavor of generosity. for the art of Kate Winslet to do a hard, not real comfortable role in the most precise manner. for David Kross who finds the best note for his Michael. for the option for Ralph Fiennes as part of a touching complex story who shall not die. a film as seed for questions. and for analysis of guilty, refuges, past and duty in dark periods. for the answers to personal drama who has roots in social events. for the first step of discovery the life. for meaning of small gestures. for beauty. and for friendship as heart of it. short, a book who must read. a film who must see.",,Anonymous,Romance
Why Oscar went to Kate?,"I never believed that Oscar always went to the best is out there, but after watching ""The Reader"" I am still wondering what Kate Winslet did in this movie to deserve the Oscar for a leading role? other than having sex with a minor!The 1st half of the Movie officially should be considered as Pronography or Adult movie as it shows very detailed aspects of having sex which would be unnecessary in a drama, showing them together half-naked in the bed would give the viewer the same understanding of their relationship, there was absolutely no need to go to those details. and in the 2nd half, she rarely had any strong play, a stubborn German woman who was ashamed of her illiterateness? even for the cost of her life!Congradulation to Academy for its new definition of a leading role as a an actress!!! Sharon Stone should have received hers for Basic Instinct.",,Anonymous,Romance
