The Aviator,"A wildly entertaining look at a larger than life character. The Aviator is another success from Scorsese. Although it doesn't follow the usual gangster theme, it still feels like a Scorsese film and manages to have nearly as great of an impact as some of his others.Going into this film, I had no idea what it was about. Based on the title and some posters that I had seen, I assumed that it would probably have something to do with aeroplanes (as it turns out, I wasn't wrong). But apart from that, I had no idea what the story would be. I was quite positively surprised, once I realized that it was a biopic, about Howard Hughes. Hughes is the type of character whose name I had heard, but that's where my knowledge ended. As such, I can't say how accurate this film's portrayal of him is. But what I can say is that it didn't feel like he was portrayed only in a good light. Indeed, the film portrays him as a very complex character driven by his obsessions and fears. Doing both good and bad.The life that Hughes lived, at least as far as it's portrayed in the movie, was full of emotion, pleasure and difficulty. The movie captures all these feelings well. Watching someone live life to the fullest doing whatever he wants to do is, in many ways, very freeing. This is one of the reasons why this movie is so entertaining at times. But the pleasure and the enjoyment weren't without difficulty. Some of the most harrowing and difficult scenes are the most intimate ones. The scenes, where we get to understand that Hughes was in pain, and struggled internally.Something that I must have always know, but somehow never realized, is the reason why Scorsese's films feel so different. It's because there is no clear beginning or ending or highpoint. These films, be it Irishman or this one, are always snippets of time and life. They follow a character from one point in time to another, never giving context on either side. That's why these films always feel so epic in proportion. In a way, they never end or begin. We, as the viewers, are left to wonder what happened before and what will happen after. Of course, if the film is about someone who actually lived, like The Aviator, we can always open up Wikipedia and read those things. But I like to live it open. I like to create the full story in my head while watching the movie and after it has ended.It's not exactly a typical Scorsese film, but it feels very much like one. Like his other films, The Aviator is just as much of a spectacle. It's entertaining enough to keep it from ever feeling boring, even though it runs for close to three hours. But, like other Scorsese films, it's also afflictive enough to leave you with more than just entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautifully photographed yet sometimes hard to watch,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Falling Short of Greatness...Again,"Scorsese has such an encyclopedic knowledge and understanding of cinema that every shot, however inventive and daring, is effortlessly composed. The direction, editing and cinematography are all the first-rate work by individuals who are clearly masters of their profession and the production design, costumes and makeup are the best you'll see all year. Their efforts combine to create a world of rich and lavish color, of excitement and glamour. Who wouldn't want to visit THIS Cotton Club in 1935? It's hard to imagine who could trump the technical team for Oscars this year.With such a perfectly realized world in which to perform, the actors universally do an outstanding job. Despite the criticism of the hardcore DiCaprio-haters, the unprejudiced will observe an excellent performance that takes genuine risks and convincingly conveys the passing of more than twenty years. Importantly, DiCaprio more than holds his own when paired with Cate Blanchett and especially Alan Alda, who both give equally note worthy performances. Blanchett's interpretation of Katherine Hepburn seems spot on, and anyone familiar with the late actresses mannerisms will appreciate the hard work that clearly went into the recreation. Alda, one of the most consistently underrated actors around, delivers another masterclass in restrained character building as he oozes ambition and political dishonesty from every pore.And yet, despite the obvious talent of all those involved and Scorsese's ability to effortlessly fill three hours, something about The Aviator fails to completely satisfy. Without wanting to sound like a film student, movies should, ultimately, be ABOUT something; love, honor, courage, redemption, the BIG ideas and themes that are the fuel of the plot. What was the drive of The Aviator? A rich guy recklessly spends lots of money to indulge his personal obsessions and gets away with it. We're never told how his experiences change him, and without change there's no journey. Considering the screenplay was written by John Logan, who usually displays a keen interest in showing the emotional evolution of his characters, the oversight is inexplicable. Ultimately then, much like Gangs of New York, The Aviator is simply the sum of it's parts, and however brilliantly those parts are realized, there doesn't seem to be a bigger theme to underpin and drive them.The Aviator is a perfectly realized recreation of the era and one well worth experiencing. But the lack of a real emotional journey suggests 'all gloss and no substance', and ultimately prevents the movie from being truly great.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Leo's Masterpiece,"There is no doubt that THE AVIATOR is the masterpiece of both director Martin Scorsese and actor, Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio becomes Howard Hughes. The actor is so profoundly absorbed in the role that the DiCaprio we know from other films cannot be found in this film. It is a bravura performance of great depth and magnitude. DiCaprio richly deserves his first Academy Award.I have never know much about Howard Hughes. This film opened my eyes to him as a personality, a businessman, aviator and his lavish lifestyle. DiCaprio no longer is the ""pretty boy"" from other films. The expressions he takes on are not handsome, the deeply furrowed brow, one could actually watch him, as Hughes' character, think his way through challenging situations, the mark of a highly gifted actor. Watching DiCaprio evolve into the paranoid schizophrenic Hughes in the latter part of the film is a stunning example of pure acting. Leo deserves recognition for recreating a most difficult personality.Though the film is long, it never slows down nor gets boring and it commanded my attention from start to finish. It is masterpiece cinema for these two men and for other actors too. Cate Blanchette must be commended for her role as Katherine Hepburn. Every role was played by first rate actors.If you want to understand a piece of American history from the 30s through the 1940s, this film will illumine you. It may not be the greatest film ever made but it sure is cinema to the max and worth seeing, without a second thought.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful,"Not too long ago I considered Scorsese to be highly overrated. I'd liked a lot of his films but didn't think any aside from Taxi Driver were amazing. When I heard about The Irishman and how it's a culmination of Scorsese's career, I decided to watch/rewatch all his films.Now I consider him one of the greatest living filmmakers as many others do. I look forward to checking out the other films of his I fear I underrated.As for this film, it's a beautiful epic capturing Hughes life with style and grace.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Golly,"From piloting the fastest plane to cruising a carriage, this movie has some serious pacing issue. First half goes by so fast and it was genuinely the most fun I've had in awhile. Then it all got mixed up like crazy, sometimes it's fast and sometime the scene played out way longer than it should. By the time it reaches the third act the pacing slowed down exponentially, it's like riding a carriage. One other thing that bothers me is the editing and CGI, especially in the flight scenes. Everything feel disconnected in the editing, one time it's showing something and in the next scene it shows a shot of the same thing in a completely different manner and the CGI is poorly animated and unconvincing. Besides all that it was great, Cate Blanchett delivers a great performance. She's enthralling and she's one of the source for the movie's great energy. DiCaprio's performance is downright amazing. He succeeds in portraying a man that is rich, reckless, full of ambition and eccentric. Even when Hughes starts to battle his own demons DiCaprio still nailed it. While at times the CGI and sloppy editing distracted me from the movie it was still a great deal of fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A GREAT American TRAGEDY,"This is an astonishingly beautiful and moving film. Martin Scorcese has created a seminal work -- one that brings the harrowing, big-studio, adult movie making of the 1970's and totally reinvents and reinvigorates it for today's audience.The story traces the rise and demise of billionaire Howard Hughes as he struggles to find meaning and purpose in a life unfettered by concerns of money, talent or opportunity. Whether trying to get a plane off the ground or a young starlet into bed, Hughes attacks life with a fierce gusto -- plagued and prodded by obsessive compulsive germphobia that constantly threatens to consume and defeat him.DiCaprio is amazing! It's the performance no one thought he was capable of. It is a dynamic, smart, funny, articulate, intense, mature and ultimately harrowing performance that relaunches his career as one of American's finest actors. At the end of the film, you just want to take him in your arms and sob. It's really that good.Cate Blanchett is incredible as Katherine Hepburn. At first, I was a little thrown by how bravely she attacked the Hepburn trademark voice, but I was completely won over by the second line. It is a tender, funny, incredibly convincing star turn that supplies the heart for the first half of the film. The scene where she takes Howard home ""for dinner"" with the family is a classic! Kate Beckinsale does a surprisingly fine job with Eva Gardner -- conveying the slow burning passion of this Hollywood icon without ever lapsing into mere mimicry.But, in the end, this isn't a love story -- it's a war story -- a war between Howard's unstoppable will and his fierce inner demons battling for Howard's soul. It is the major relationship in the movie and the true heart of the film -- one that fuels his eccentric genius and yet constantly threatens to rip his life apart. He tries to ignore it by sleeping with every beauty in town. He tries to outrun it, building faster and faster airplanes. Yet, it is his one constant companion from early childhood to his ultimate, inescapable end. And it is this relationship that leaves you devastated at the end of the film.Brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
For once the hype is accurate! A must see!,"Leonardo Dicaprio, once again, shows his depth as an artist and his ability to carry a film. He deserves the Golden Globe, and his due as an outstanding actor. Howard Hughes, the man, remains a mystery and the portrayal of his obsessive compulsive disorder was a powerful view into his inner hell. The beginning scene set the pace for a journey into his privileged and dark world. The Aviator showed the torments and gifts of genius. Amazing job by all involved!

Chaotic But Compelling,"The Aviator is typical Scorsese: chaotic, self-indulgent, grandiose and a film clearly different from the indistinguishable blend of movies. As you can surmise, the film is a mixed bag. The scale and artistry are worth noting as is DiCaprio's performance(although it feels like he only kicks into gear for the latter half), but some other parts are too wild. And many of the supporting roles feel artificial and obnoxious i.e Cate Blanchett.Howard Hughes' life is certainly one worth retelling; a pioneer of aviation and film who struggled with severe mental issues and The Aviator does a fair job accomplishing it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very different and sad look at the life of Howard Hughes.,"Years ago, Tommy Lee Jones made himself famous for playing Howard Hughes in a made for TV movie called ""The Amazing Howard Hughes"". The film clocked in at over three and a half hours and was a wonderful look at the man. Now, about 25 years later, Martin Scorsese has created a new biography of the man--though the film is under three hours long--so naturally things had to be omitted. Considering how complex Hughes was, they easily could have made a mini-series out of his life--but the film STILL is very good and worth seeing despite its brevity (and 170 minutes IS brief given the subject matter). It differs from the Jones film because instead of trying to encompass all of Hughes life, it focuses much more specifically on the psychological decline of the man and really builds a wonderful sense of profound sadness in seeing this decline.While Leonardo DiCaprio didn't look or sound as much like Hughes as Tommy Lee Jones did, he was quite good in this breakout role--and was nominated for Best Actor. However, the one who managed to earn an Academy Award was Cate Blanchette--who was just wonderful as Katharine Hepburn. Her voice and mannerisms were dead on--and she played the role, at times, in a hilarious fashion. Apart from these two, the other stars of the film are the cinematographers, set designers, director and CGI techs (who managed to create an AMAZING plane crash sequence that blew my mind). Overall, a film that is best seen not as a replacement for the earlier film but an enhancement--and I think seeing BOTH would be a great idea. Well made and well worth seeing.By the way, isn't it kind of ironic that Alec Baldwin plays the part of a HUGE airline exec--considering Baldwin's recent relationship with some airlines!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very Long and Drags much of the time,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after all the press and favourable ratings. We saw it on opening day in the Detroit area and found the movie to be just OK. I give it a 4 on the scale of 10. Acting was OK, script was so so. I was expecting much more action I guess. The movie was at least 45 minutes too long IMO, most of the people walking out of the large theatre which was about 3/4 empty felt about the same way based on comments that we overheard. The story seemed to ramble on with no progression, little dramatic tension and then ended at what seemed to be an arbitrary point. It seemed that there wasn't a lot of continuity from scene to scene. In short, given the positive press, it was a disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Leo's best,"Leonardo D. was absolutely amazing. He was so accurate in the actions of someone with OCD. I have that disorder and he is so relatable. I know that the movie is about Howard Hughes (who was an absolute genius, even though he was a mad man), but Leo's performance was amazing. This is the movie that made people forget his role in Titanic and respect him as the amazing actor he is. I also really liked the costumes and music. The lipstick, the hair... again, they were right on for the period. Cate Blanchett made a perfect Katherine Hepburn. She was able to become the loud, powerful, intelligent woman that was Katherine Hepburn.If you haven't seen the movie yet you are truly missing out.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Open the Door...,"Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is grand spectacle with a reverence for the nostalgic, set in simpler times. As a snapshot of Howard Hughes's life from 1927 to 1947, ""The Aviator"" is a portrait of a man of genius and unmatched innovation, and also a man debilitated by severe obsessive compulsive disorder and extreme depression. ""The Aviator"" has an amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, and a mesmerizing performance by Cate Blanchett, who seems to inhabit the role of Katherine Hepburn-- the love of Hughes's life. However, the one indelible image I have of the film is the scene in which Hughes is frozen in the men's restroom, because he can't make himself touch the door knob for fear of germs and contamination. Granted this was a time before obsessive compulsive disorder existed as a diagnosis. The scene is intended as a dramatic arc, distinguishing a tragic flaw in Hughes. However, for me it seemed overly indulgent, and was curious regarding the scene length. Much like most of the nearly 3 hour movie, this is an exercise in indulgence, and attention to detail that is only that. Scorsese's balance between Hughes's genius and his great suffering is good melodrama, but not very inspiring. I have a particular affinity for Howard Hughes the man. Had John Lone's (and Michael Mann's) story followed Hughes through the 1950's and beyond, the story would be even sadder. ""The Aviator"" illustrates the highs of genius, and the abyss of near insanity. This is an accurate depiction of an amazing man's life, but it is skewed toward the broken aspect. So just personally for me, it was frustrating to watch. To Scorsese's credit, one gets that he has immense compassion for Howard Hughes.Hughes' life sentence is established in the opening scene. Hughes's mother while bathing the young Hughes, tells him something that perhaps leads to his obsessive compulsive nature. Apparently he is incomplete in his relationship with his mother, and the story surrounding what she said.Fast forward to 1927, when Hughes left his father's wealthy drill bit tool company in Texas, to be a maverick film maker in California. Hughes is an ambitious and novice film director, but he is smart and has unmatched drive. However, his real genius is as a pilot and an innovative designer of airplanes. His gifts for fame and fortune are established. Hughes (DiCaprio) then pursues a touching romance with Katherine Hepburn (Blanchett). This is the highlight of ""The Aviator"", even amidst the spectacular aerial cinematography, because it is just about relationships that move people. There is a wonderful moment when Hughes lets Hepburn take control of his plane as they fly above Los Angeles at night. As great as the chemistry is between Dicaprio and Blanchett, this romance part of the story goes on a little too long in the context of the movie.From this point on, the movie becomes increasingly darker. Sure, Hughes has his share of triumphs, but everything is tempered by his spiraling decline into depression and his debilitating obsessive compulsive disorder. The acting is outstanding throughout the picture. This is Leonardo DiCaprio's most mature performance. He truly captures Hughes's intensity, genius, and charm. His suffering also elicits great compassion. Cate Blanchett is outstanding as Kate Hepburn. At first one wonders whether she is doing a caricature of Hepburn. She is not. She is being Hepburn. Blanchett's performance is simply stunning. An unrecognizable Kate Beckinsale is awesome as Ava Gardner. Beckinsale gives surprising layers to Gardner, who is really not all that she appears to be on the surface. John C. Reilly is fabulous as Hughes's CFO. In an understated fashion Reilly's performance anchors the movie. Alec Baldwin as Pan Am CEO, Juan Trippe, and Matt Ross as Hughes's engineer Glenn Odekirk give strong performances.Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is spectacular to view, and has a sense of history and tragedy. He offers an interesting portrait of the dichotomy between genius and madness, with an emphasis on the dark. This choice really lost me. ""The Aviator"" is amazing work, that is not very inspiring, though it was probably not intended to do so. That is a bit of a disappointment.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gorgeous but emotionally empty,"A curious film in so many ways; it is a truly gorgeous film, great cinematography and editing to keep it as tight as possible but there is something missing at his very heart! It will obviously win Oscars, this is just the niche that the Academy voters are looking for, and I'll bet that it makes a pretty penny....but it sort of reminds me of ""The Last Emperor"" which I have never felt deserved a ""Best Picture"" Oscar in that there is minimal involvement asked of the viewer and a feeling of Who cares??? I disagree that it is a ""must-see"" depending on how much time and energy is available to you, the viewer. I found the other major's of 2004 to be much more involving, particularly ""Finding Neverland"", Spanglish, Sideways and Closer. As James Berardinelli reports, Scorcese would seem to have lost something since ""Goodfellows"".",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Interesting Muddle,"""The Aviator""--a biopic of Howard Hughes-- is clearly one of Scorsese's lesser works. Still, a lesser work from Scorsese is far superior to the greatest work of your average director. Here's the rundown:The first quarter of the film is a total triumph, showing the young Hughes' bold endeavors in film when he produced what was at the time the most expensive and lavish film ever made. Scorsese tipping his hat to old Hollywood is the most fun he has had since ""Goodfellas."" The costumes, set designs, and pacing of this portion of the film are stunning and suck the viewer in.The rest of the film, despite Scorsese's amazing and vivid attention to detail, is a muddled mess, giving us glimpses into Hughes' obsessive (and compulsive) ways, his womanizing, his ambitious foray into aviation and the early days of commercial flight, his fight against Congress at the end of WWII, and the notorious plight and ultimately single flight of his infamous ""Spruce Goose."" It's all semi-educational and semi-entertaining, but in the end I think the complicated life of Hughes remains a mystery.As for the performances, they are amazing (thanks in most part to Scorsese, the ultimate actor's director). Leonardo Dicaprio in the title role gives yet another performance that goes against my natural loathing of him, and although he seems a bit too boyish playing Hughes in the latter years (and the film really suffers for it), he's impeccable for the better part of the film. Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn is simply stunning and steals every moment she is on screen. Her look, her mannerisms, and her speech perfectly match the screen legend to a haunting degree. Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin in supporting quasi-villain roles are methodically perfect. And the nicest surprise was Kate Beckinsale, a normally flaccid actress, playing Ava Gardner. She came across as gorgeous, intelligent, and maximized her minimal screen time without ever overtly stealing her scenes. Like Sharon Stone in ""Casino"" and Cameron Diaz in ""Gangs of New York"" Scorsese once again coaxes a great performance out of an otherwise unremarkable pretty face.In the end, ""The Aviator"" flies high thanks to Scorsese and the acting, even if the real person it depicts remains lost in a muddle of half truths and speculation.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Three Characters,"We all live in our own movies, and particularly like movies of people who do so more literally. Here are three in one film:Martin Scorsese: My regular readers know that I have been very critical of his films. Sure, they are crafted well enough, but the world he created was not one worth visiting. His films until recently were of the Italian storytelling school which focuses on characters. Those characters do not inhabit their worlds as much as create them. Scorsese's camera, therefore, was affixed to people, almost by a visible thread.But those of us who watch film seriously know that there is nothing but empty darkness just outside the camera's eye. There's no world, so there can be no God, or fate, or luck or whatever material you imagine fills the river of life. He knows it is a cheat as well and has said so. Just like many other fabulously successful filmmakers who know their work is hollow, in his later years he's tried to mature... to master a greater notion of creation.""Gangs"" was a success in this regard though an unfinished film because the Weinsteins pulled the plug. It marked a completely different approach to space and context, and I applauded it. Now he actually finishes a movie in the new style. Though this is a story of a man, it is no longer anchored to the man. The camera is now Orson Welles' camera with shots of the space with people in it. So obvious is some of this that when Hughes first retreats, he stays out a room that inexplicably (and unhistorically) has strings tied from hither and yon from objects. Take another look at that room and see all of Scorsese's old camera angles. I think we can welcome Scorsese now as the best new filmmaker of the year. This is as much his story as Hughes'.Cate Blanchett: Cate is one of three actresses alive who can fold her acting, meaning that she can simultaneously deliver two characters in the same motions. She's at the top of her game here (while Julianne is devolving with an apparently thick husband). Hepburn was an amazing actress, deeply untalented in the conventional measures but capable of engineering her surroundings to suit. Her engineering of the ""Philadelphia Story"" persona is Hollywood legend. She engineered a character that worked, then stepped into it. The old Scorsese would have hired someone like Streep to play Hepburn and lumbered around after her.The new Scorsese allows Cate to flower and willingly supports the folding: an actress (Cate) playing a character (Kate) who is playing a character. You can see all the conduits of control, all the taught strings at two levels. God, what a great time to be alive!Howard Hughes: The movie gave the impression that Howard simply inherited his money. No so. He was a brilliant engineer who famously codesigned systems and the engineering organizations to support them. While most of us were barfing at frat parties, he designed a drill bit (often credited to his father) that is still the standard in the industry, together with a set of screw connections that has since become the international standard. That's where the money came from. And though he went loopy toward the end, he ensured that 100% of his wealth (yes, all assets were sold) went to endow the world's largest private research institute.This was a passionate engineer in a world of monopolistic thugs (Gates take notice), truly what we like to think the ""free market"" is all about. The movie also ignores a key movie connection: He always intended the ""Spruce Goose"" to be made of wood, and because all US manufacturing assets were committed, he designed a production system that allowed small businesses, even backyard groups, to make pieces that would be floated down rivers and successively be glued into larger parts. This (what he called the ""packet production system"") was the first serious research into what we today call ""virtual enterprises.""When the war ended, he sent his virtual enterprise experts into his film business where they used the system (freely giving away details) to destroy the vertically integrated studio system. Nearly all movies today use his virtual enterprise approach and the Weinsteins (producers of this very film) are the current masters of the system.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Biography
Hobbies,"Switching from gangsters to one of the most colorful tycoons of industry Martin Scorsese took the first step in making The Aviator a success when he cast Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes. As he did as J. Edgar Hoover, DiCaprio has the spirit of the man invade his body as he portrays the Texas based industrialist, aviator, and movie producer. He had all those careers at the same time and dealt with a lot demons besides.The Hughes fortune comes from Howard Hughes, Sr. who patented a drill bit that is the foundation of all oil drilling on planet Earth. If you don't use that drill bit, you can dig for oil with a pick and shovel for however long it takes. It is one of the most profitable patents in the world and it was the foundation of the Hughes wealth.Which allowed Howard Hughes to indulge himself in two passions which were to all intents and purposes, hobbies. Aviation and movie producing were what drove him. And when we meet him he's shooting and reshooting and reshooting Hell's Angels. A lot of his own money went into the film which eventually was a success and gave Hughes the first of many perks as a Hollywood tycoon, Jean Harlow as played here by Gwen Stefani.Faith Domergue, Ava Gardner, and most importantly Katharine Hepburn and there were many others follow in the Hughes story. Cate Blanchett won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for becoming Katharine Hepburn. With some of the liberties taken I don't think it's an accident that The Aviator came out a year after Hepburn died at 96. The movie also missed Jean Peters whom Hughes actually married and Terry Moore who is still alive and who claims she did marry him. Jane Russell and The Outlaw and the famous brassiere personally designed by Hughes also get a passing mention.As for aviation which was his real love, Hughes had a decades rivalry with Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe of Pan American Airlines. Trippe had more friends in Congress, particularly a rightwing Republican Senator named Ralph Owen Brewster played by Alan Alda. Alda got an Oscar nomination himself playing the smarmy Brewster who threatens to destroy Hughes by Congressional investigation. Hughes who was hardly a liberal in his politics totally turned the tables on the Brewster committee and the Senator himself. Not shown in the film but in 1952 Hughes made it his business to defeat Brewster going for a third term and did.Besides Blanchett's Oscar The Aviator won several others and was nominated for several more including Best Picture and Best Actor for Leonardo DiCaprio.In my memory Howard Hughes was the eccentric billionaire who stayed in seclusion and ran his enterprises through a network of underlings. DiCaprio does a wonderful job in showing how Hughes became what he was, his mania against germs instilled by his mother. To have all that money and be living in the largest plastic bubble one could create. Hughes made himself a prisoner in his own mind before he became a prisoner of the jail he personally designed.The Aviator is a marvelous insight into one of the most eccentric and colorful people of the last century.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Concurrent Rise and Fall of a Legend,"Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best actors of his generation. Martin Scorsese is the greatest director of all time. They have made a formidable pair over the years and sometimes I think DiCaprio is miscast for certain roles (""Gangs of New York,"" ""The Departed""), but ""The Aviator"" has DiCaprio's name all over it. This is one of the best, if not thee best, acting performances I have seen since Robert De Niro in ""Raging Bull."" Both characters have their similarities as well. Jake La Motta had his own inner demons which lead to his paranoia about his wife which ultimately lead to the destruction of the people around him and Howard Hughes' demons are brought front and center as we see where it all starts when he's given a bath at an age where the young Howard should be more than capable to cleaning himself. His mother tells him about all the diseases and makes him spell the word ""quarantine."" In this unsettling opening scene we see where his delusions start.DiCaprio can be hilarious at times and heartbreaking at others. Scorsese and DiCaprio do an incredible job of taking us from the marvel of his genius and innovation in aviation to the destruction of his OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). It starts off slow with a few hints here and there that something isn't quite right with Howard Hughes, but gradually we see more and more and more and more and more until we finally see some horrifying acts from Hughes as he locks himself in his projection room playing reels of his films ""The Outlaw"" and ""Hell's Angels"" over and over and over and over again. These films have been completed and released, but Hughes is still watching. Still looking for these imperfections. He's stuck. He's stuck in his mind and he's stuck in his life and he's stuck in his projection room.There are some very good scenes with Cate Blanchett, who plays Katharine Hepburn, and quite wonderfully I might add, and by wonderfully I mean terribly annoying, loud, and excessive. The damn woman does not shut up. Howard says, ""I could always hear you."" She replies, ""That's 'cause I'm so Goddamn loud."" Yes you are miss Hepburn, yes you are. They have some great scenes together, but the best one comes when Howard meets her entire family and it's quite possibly the greatest dinner sequence I have ever seen. It's beautifully shot as we watch Howard Hughes struggle to keep up with all the conversations going on at the same time due to his deafness. They are extremely rude people and they bully him and then he finally snaps and we feel so good for him. Katherine Hepburn is a completely different person with her family than alone with Howard. Howard accuses her of acting in her real life and wonders if she even knows anymore. This leads to the destruction of their relationship and leads to more paranoia from Howard Hughes as he burns all the cloths that she had infected. He calls Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) to tell him to buy him some cloths and then quickly changes the conversation and starts asking him about recorders and asks if he's recording his conversation. This is where Howard Hughes and his paranoia starts to take off.The best part of the film comes in the third act, during a simple and what some may think as a rather uneventful Congressional Hearing. It's two people cross examining each other, what could be so great about that? You would have to see to understand it. Alan Alda is the villain as Senator, Ralph Brewster, who is trying to pass a CAB Bill through the Senate that will put a monopoly on the air ways giving Pan Am sole possession of the sky. Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) had his people create the bill on their behalf to shut out the competition from Hughes' growing airway company- Trans World America- which is expanding across the Atlantic Ocean into Europe. Brewster and Trippe team up to investigate Hughes as they try to embarrass him in public by revealing all his secrets. They order the FBI to raid Hughes' house over and over again causing Howard Hughes to shut himself off from outsiders like nothing you have ever seen before. They threaten to take Hughes down by investigating what he did with the 50 million he received from the government to build plans that ultimately didn't fly during the war. Howard Hughes can simply sell over Trans World America to Juan Trippe and everything will be forgotten to hide him of the public embarrassment. Alda is spectacular and so crafty, always looking for a way to the top, or always getting his way with a smile on his face, just rubbing his arrogance in the face of everybody. During the Congressional Hearings the film reaches it's climax. This is where Hughes tries to overcome his extremely paranoid state and go to these Congressional Hearings and fight for his reputation. The battle that ensues between Alda and DiCaprio is incredible to watch. The final sequences brings us triumph. Only then are we brought right back down as we see Howard Hughes has not progressed in the final scene. It's a brutal ending it the subtlest of ways. The fact that we seen him at the Congressional Hearings gave us hope that he can somehow recover from his paranoid state; that he conquered his fear. Then, we are shot right back down with the final moments of the film capping off an incredible roller-coaster ride of emotions. The final act of the film is what I thought would undoubtedly give Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar, but to my surprise that didn't happen and that's a shame because he is absolutely incredible here. A fan of his or not, you can't deny his greatness in ""The Aviator.""One of Scorsese' best.10/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Like the Platte River ...Too long...Too Shallow,"﻿ The Aviator is about aviation innovator Howard Hughes. It is about womanizer Howard Hughes. It is about psychopath Howard Hughes. Any one of these would have made an interesting film. Altogether they resulted in a shallow portrayal over too long a period of time to retain my interest. In short, I was bored.Let's look at the love affairs. The bit about Jean Harlow was so minuscule it could easily have been cut with no harm to the biography. The same could be said about the scenes with Faith Domergue. The Ava Gardner story could have been interesting, but it was too fragmented to be of interest. Only the Kate Hepburn story was truly compelling, mostly because of the exceptional performance of Cate Blanchett. Still, even this episode  which could have been developed into a two-hour story  left me wanting.Then, there's the psycho-pathological element. Who was his mother and why did she treat him like she did? We don't know. Was this a sexually abusive relationship? The opening bath scene leaned in that direction, but we don't know. If Hughes was so horrendously phobic, why did the phobia take so long to emerge and wreck his life? We don't know. It's a shame the writer and director did not reveal the answers to these questions. Perhaps no one knows the answers; we just know he was psychopathic.Finally, let's talk about aviation. I love airplanes. I could relate to Hughes' passion. I could thrill with his gallivanting around the skies  racing, filming, testing, wooing Hepburn. I didn't even mind the fact that nothing in the air was real  just computer generated images. I wanted to stand by his side when he faced off with greedy Juan Trippe and sleazy Senator Owen Brewster. I wanted to fight with him and fight for him. But even this was shallowly presented. The evidence is readily apparent: major characters, identified by labels as if this were a documentary, enter the story without the viewer being prepared for who they are, why they are there, and why we should care about them. I just couldn't get hooked. I didn't care.Interesting note: when I was first out of college, I worked as a technical writer with a man who was nearly at the end of his career. He had been with Hughes Aircraft and had the dubious honor, along with three or four others, of pulling Hughes from one of his many plane crashes. My fellow employee told tales of Hughes and of the rescue for which Howard ensured him of employment for as long as he wanted to stay on.Sadly, The Aviator added nothing to my knowledge of Howard Hughes and, although it had great potential to tell a fabulous story about one of aviation's most celebrated innovators, it failed.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Katharine Hepburn Show.,"Before Howard Hughes was a recluse so reclusive as to out-Salinger J.D. Salinger, he was a big time stud, who made big movies, flew fast planes, and courted gorgeous ladies; so say Martin Scorsese and John Logan, architects of this latest Hollywood biopic.' Leonardo DiCaprio continues his trend of turning in great performances with great directors, playing Howard Hughes between 1927 and 1947, the years where Hughes conquered the worlds of film and aviation, making room for romance with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). In later years, Hughes's mental problems would become legendary; at this stage in the game, he suffers only from pronounced germ phobia and mild obsessive-compulsive disorder. This is all expertly depicted by Scorsese, Logan, and DiCaprio. Stealing all her scenes is Cate Blanchett, who should start making room on her mantle for her Best Supporting Actress Oscar. It couldn't have been easy to play an iconic movie star like Katharine Hepburn, but Blanchett aces it. Kate Beckinsale, Kelli Garner (Faith Demorgue), and Gwen Stefani (Jean Harlow) are the other women in Howard's life, although none are as clearly defined as Blanchett/Hepburn. The villains of the piece are Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda, playing, respectively, Pan-American Airways CEO Juan Trippe and Trippe's bought-and-paid-for politician, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. Both excel, with Alda coming off as both slimy and goofy at the same time. Alec Baldwin, like Cate Blanchett, steals every scene he has, playing Trippe as a delightfully suave villain. In his final scene he delivers a wonderful monologue on the future of Hughes's Trans-World Airline, and caps it off with the most hysterical use of the F word in many years. Also appearing: the dependable John C. Reilly as Hughes's business manager Noah Dietrich; Jude Law, who apparently can't go two weeks without seeing himself in a different movie, as movie legend Errol Flynn; Brent Spiner (yay!) as airplane executive Robert Gross; and Willem Dafoe as a photographer. ""The Aviator"" is overlong, and drags in places, but it is a great movie. I rate it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Aviator - Fiction as history,"What amazes me most about the film is how historically inaccurate it is. The purported Hepburn/Hughes relationship is the worst. This is what really happened.Howard Hughes and Kate Hepburn met originally in late summer 1935 while she was making Sylvia Scarlett. She didn't care for him and was also involved with her agent, Leland Hayward. KH didn't see Hughes again for over a year.So the scene of him picking her up on the Sylvia Scarlett location to go golfing is incorrect.In November, 1936, Hepburn broke up with Hayward. Hughes, as he frequently did when pursuing a woman, renewed his effort to get to know Hepburn knowing that she was on the rebound from a failed relationship. This time he succeeded and they began an affair in January, 1937 while she was on tour in a play.After the play ended in May, 1937 she moved into Howard's house in Los Angeles. Hepburn and Hughes lived in his house for one year, from May 1937 to June 1938. By then her career had taken a dive and she lost her contract with RKO. She decided to go back east to do a play. She moved out of Hughes' house.In her autobiography, Me, Stories of My Life, she said that the romance really ended at the time of the September 1938 hurricane which destroyed her family's summer home at Fenwick, Connecticut. She wrote: ""The next day God sent the hurricane of 1938. The house at Fenwick disappeared. Howard had a pilot fly in with water - - and I knew that Howard and I had become friends and not lovers. Love had turned to water. Pure water. But water."" As can be seen, their affair lasted a little less than two years, from January 1937 to September 1938. The film has the relationship lasting from 1935 to 1941 which is completely incorrect.Three years after she broke up with Hughes, Kate met Spencer Tracy. This was in August, 1941. Tracy and Hepburn commenced a relationship that lasted 26 years until his death in 1967. Kate beginning a relationship with Tracy had nothing to do with her break up with Hughes which had happened three years prior. Since the two events were totally unrelated, there would have been no scene where Hughes was upset about Hepburn telling him that she and Tracy were involved and no break up with Hughes because she had met Tracy.Hughes never bribed a tabloid editor to keep 'compromising' pictures of Tracy and Hepburn out of the tabloids. To begin with there were no tabloids to speak of in the 1940s. That was a phenomenon of the 1950s. Second, there were never any compromising photos of T&H. Third, if there had been compromising photos of them, their studio, MGM, would have dealt with the issue. They never needed Hughes for that purpose. MGM had a hell of a lot more clout with the press than Hughes would ever have had. In fact, every mention of Tracy in the film is completely fiction. There's no reason to have him in the film at all since he had nothing to do with Howard Hughes or the Hepburn/Hughes relationship.The film has a scene where KH goes to a film premiere with Hughes. The date isn't clear but I guess it's 1939? Ava Gardner shows up at the premiere as well even though she wasn't in Hollywood. As has been previously noted, KH and Hughes broke up in 1938. It's ludicrous to show a scene with KH at a premiere with Hughes in 1939. She wasn't seeing Hughes at all much less going to social events with him. The other point, of course, is that Hepburn never went to premieres, not even the premieres of her own films nor to nightclubs. She was also known for not wearing dresses. The idea that she was prancing off to nightclubs and movie premieres in dresses is just plain silly.Howard Hughes did not lock himself in a screening room for several days (or weeks) during the time frame that The Aviator covers. That episode occurred in 1957. And, of course, in any event Hepburn would have not been trying to coax Hughes out of the screening room since she wasn't involved with him in either 1947 or 1957. This scene is completely fictional.Hepburn's father was a distinguished urologist and surgeon who was the head of the urology department at Hartford Hospital. Hepburn's mother was a well known advocate of women's rights including the right to vote in the 1910s and 20s and later the right of women to use birth control. They were not independently wealthy. Dr. Hepburn worked for his money. They didn't live in a palatial mansion. They were not snobs and they certainly didn't look down on Hughes. KH said in her autobiography that ""my family was not too sympathetic to Howard. In the first place, he was everlastingly on the telephone. And the telephone was in the dining room. Long telephone conversations did not suit the atmosphere. . . ."" While, it's true they didn't get along with him it wasn't because they thought he was beneath them. So this whole scene is false as well as being incredibly insulting to the Hepburn family.There are many other errors but the 1000 word limit keeps me from describing them all.It's quite obvious that the film makers decided to portray Hepburn in the film because she's still well remembered. She, in fact, was only briefly involved with Hughes and he was involved with many, many women. If the film makers wanted to be accurate they would have included Billie Dove and Jean Peters but then, no one remembers them so they invented a grand passion between Hughes and Hepburn which simply never happened.",,Anonymous,Biography
not best picture material,"Since this got a lot of award nominations, I thought it would be better. It was OK, but too long. There is so much to tell about Howard Hughes; you can't do it in one film. And this movie stops when he was still fairly young. We don't see him in his later years when he was really nuts.The lesson to this movie, if you let unstable people have a bunch of money, then they are going to do some crazy things. Hughes throws money around to build his dream planes and to make movies that aren't very good. According to this movie, his biggest enemy was Pan-Am, who was trying to keep TWA from flying overseas.Also, the movie shows a lot of his girlfriends, many of whom were famous actresses. It never dwells to deep into his personal relationships though. I'm sure there were many more interesting things about them.FINAL VEDICT: It was OK, not great. And we learn Hughes sure loved his bar of soap. If you're into biographies then you'd probably like it; otherwise, I would skip it. Also Leo is sort of hot in this, but they have to make him look crazy in some parts. So, it isn't the best film to Leo watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Ambitious, Impeccably-Acted, DELIVERS","Martin Scorsese's most recent ambitious project does not disappoint.I just saw this film in a special preview for NYU film students, with Martin Scorsese there to discuss and answer questions after, and I must say, it was pretty phenomenal. It is Martin Scorsese's best work since Goodfellas (this is obvious) and most probably his best work since Raging Bull. DiCaprio's character study of Howard Hughes, and his devotion to this role, is exquisite and reminiscent even of Robert De Niro's in Raging Bull. The film is lengthy, but this compliments it, for the story is riveting and the production is practically flawless (even the combination of computerized processes and more traditional photography was smooth and effective).The presentation of the film, in an evolving color (from two-tone Technicolor, as Martin explained it to us, to three-tone, to modern by the later sequences) is absolutely stunning, and the cinematography by renowned Robert Richardson, ASC, is some of the best I've seen (and, in my opinion, deserving of an Oscar).Cate Blanchett was impeccable as Katharine Hepburn, though, at times, I felt that the complexity of her character was never really deeper than a surface analysis.She did her role flawlessly, but this is not to say that it really Alec Baldwin portrayed one of the flattest villains I've seen in a major motion picture, but, again, this is about Howard Hughes, and DiCaprio's performance is worthy of an Oscar nod at least, and perhaps an Oscar Win (certainly the best performance I've seen all year).One of my few complaints, though, is the lengthy sequences featuring Howard Hughes as a solo aviator. Though interesting, entertaining even, the film was long enough already, and did not require such an exhaustive analysis of individual flight procedures.Also, it seems that some of the themes were almost too redundant, such as the ways in which Hughes' psychological problems were performed. Much of the Hollywood history is good, even interesting, but it also sometimes seemed a bit self-indulgent, to the point where you questioned the necessity of ALL of those nightclub sequences in the film.But, besides those relatively few complaints, it is a spectacular film.In all: do not miss it.3.5/4",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Shots and Issues Too Long,"My father worked for Hughes Aircraft for over 30 years, so our family was especially interested in seeing this film about Howard Hughes. I enjoyed seeing the cinematography in this film. It was very nicely shot, especially the night scenes. However, I felt that the film's shots were overall too long. Confrontation scenes between Howard Hughes and Katherine Hepburn went on too long as did scenes showing Howard Hughes' neurosis (hand washing, being distracted by camera flashes and lens changes). I felt that to see a little bit of this was enough, but each scene seemed to be played out much longer than was needed to bring home the point. I also felt that too much time was spent with Howard Hughes' relationships with women (especially Katherine Hepburn) and not enough time showing each of the successes that Howard Hughes had in his career, especially aviation. I think that the prologue should have started out with his father inventing the oil drill bit that was patented. This would have been a better visual explanation of how the family got it's money. It's only alluded to in the film, but it would have been better to have shown this to create a foundation for the family money. I found myself squirming at times because I wanted the film to move more rapidly out of scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fun to watch... but nothing to get frantic about either.,"I felt that the performances were good. Not amazing. Not excellent. Good.To me that means these actors delivered the lines well, nothing the director recommended or framed them in got in the way and I enjoyed watching the film.Audiences and Critics (even armchair) are a bit too quick to throw recent movies into the ""Great!"" category. Leo's portrayal of Hughes was admirable. He did a good job... but was he fabulous? Cate Blanchett... OK, I can buy the Hepburn act for 3 hours. Still, is it really great acting or a great impression? I'll give her a break and say she was good at both.Great is Denzel Washington in Glory, John Turturro in Barton Fink or even Clark Gable in The Misfits. Somehow, this one seems a little too close to made for TV if it wasn't for the incredible cinematography and amazing pace that only Scorsese can master.I can't pick any actor out of this and say they were bad. That's the best thing about this one. I was caught in the story.Leo DID seem too young and skimpy throughout the film.Anyway, hats off to all of 'em. It's a movie worth watching, and that's better than most of the junk coming out of Hollywoodland these days.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perhaps the best movie of 2004!,"Leave it to Martin Scorsese, he is one of the few reliable directors who graces in age, still manages to make outstanding movies. I thought his previous film; GANGS OF NEW YORK was the best film of 2002 (and still stand by that comment). Scorsese who was once known for showing us the gritty realistic world of New York City's ""Mean Streets"" with the Little Italy thugs (MEAN STREETS), anti-hero loners (TAXI DRIVER), fallen hero (RAGING BULL), bizarre world of Soho (AFTER HOURS), realistic thugs (GOODFELLAS), gangsters controlling Las Vegas (CASINO; it wasn't in NYC, but it still had the similar theme), guilt ridden paramedic (BRINGING OUT THE DEAD), and the war between immigrants (GANGS OF NEW YORK). This is the Scorsese that all of us know about and remember. Yet Scorsese was also responsible for telling us about a single mother in the southwest struggling to survive (ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE), the final farewell concert of a fantastic rock/folk group The Band (THE LAST WALTZ), and the story of Jesus Christ (LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ). Now Scorsese has become the storyteller of one of the most enthusiastic and eccentric billionaires of recent years, Howard Hughes.In THE AVIATOR, Scorsese portrays Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) as several different roles: filmmaker, womanizer, entrepreneur, engineer, germ-phobic, and aviator. The film tells about the achievements that Hughes accomplished such as the movies HELL'S ANGELS & THE OUTLAW, the building of an airplane that can fly above 20,000 feet, acquiring TWA and making it a international airline, and the design and building of the largest airplane ever the Hercules (now known as the Spruce Goose). Yet Hughes went through so many conflicts with his business: Pan Am Airline chief Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), Maine Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), Louis B. Mayer (Stanley DeSantis); his romance: Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsdale); and himself: paranoia, and obsession compulsion disorder.THE AVIATOR discusses all of those elements in rich detail, that after watching the movie, you begin to realize the amazing accomplishments that Hughes did. Wonder why the only thing we most remember about Hughes was being a recluse who was afraid of germs. And would like to know more about Howard Hughes and see the films that were discussed in the film.This isn't a Scorsese film that people want another TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS, CASINO, or RAGING BULL would expect. This is a different kind of Scorsese, one who is telling a story about a man, who is no different that him. A dreamer who dreams big and ignores what his advisors, and partners tell him, then come up with projects with amazing results.DiCaprio proves that he his under-appreciated actor in this film. While most of the public see him as that goofy kid who shouts, ""I'm king of the world!"" in TITANIC. Yet most don't realize his talent with such roles as in WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. THE AVIATOR shows that DiCaprio is a great actor, giving a realistic portrayal of the eccentric Hughes in some scenes, and a man who cleanses the germs that represent people he dislikes or negative incidents. Blanchett does a amazing job with her performance of Katherine Hepburn with the way her head is tilted back to the pronunciation of words to the snobbish like personality she has when she is around her parents. While Beckinsdale also does a great job playing the very sexy Ava Gardner who has a love/hate relationship with Hughes, a woman who hates him at times, but will help him when he needs help.The supporting performances by John C. Reily, Ian Holm, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Danny Huston, and Matt Ross are all top rate and also deserve recognition as well.And Scorsese proves that he one of the best directors of all time with several elements. First the pacing of the story, the film never drags and at running time of 169 mins. it kept my attention on what was going to be happening next. Second, some of the scenes of the film were of complete beauty and wonder. One scene that blew my mind was during the filming of the aerial scenes from HELLS ANGELS which showed how dangerous it was filming the dogfight scenes from that film, seventy years before computer generated images would replace that technique. Third, the acting by the actors was top notch and very convincing. Finally, the story of Howard Hughes himself was unique and original and I think there will never be another person like Howard Hughes.This has been quite a year of movies: COLLATERAL, SIDEWAYS, KILL BILL VOL. 2, THE INCREDIBLES, RAY, A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, THE TERMINAL, FAHRENHEIT 9/11, BOURNE SUPREMENCY, OCEANS TWELVE, CRIMINAL, SPIDER-MAN 2, MEAN GIRLS, HARRY POTTER & PRISONER OF AZKABAN, and SPANGLISH were all films that were amazing and all were among my favorite films of this year (yet I still need to see LIFE AQUATIC and FINDING NEVERLAND). But I think it will be hard to beat THE AVIATOR, for it's story, characters, and epic feel.The Academy has snubbed Scorsese for 30 years; they did the same thing for Roman Polanski until THE PIANIST. Now I think its time for the Academy to acknowledge Scorsese for his craft and technique. While some people will believe that Scorsese should have won his Oscar back in 1980 with RAGING BULL, or in 1990 with GOODFELLAS, I feel that it's time to recognize Scorsese for something! And THE AVIATOR is one film that I think that most Scorsese devotees (like myself) feel is worthy of recognition. Plus, if this movie wins both Best Director and Best Picture, then two of my favorite directors will win Oscars (Scorsese and Michael Mann, who produced AVIATOR).So that is why I am rooting and hoping that THE AVIATOR will collect Oscar gold. The best movie of the year, and don't miss it!!!!! ***** (Out of five)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good but overall disappointing,"I went to see this film with a fair amount of trepidation following Scorsese last effort, the truly awful Gangs of New York.However 'The Aviator' is certainly a cut above this. Contrary to what others have said though it is no where near the quality of Raging Bull or Casino et al.DiCaprio's performance is excellent. His energetic depiction of the brilliant and often reckless Hughes is highly engaging. But it is perhaps in his portrayal of Hughes's hidden battle with mental illness that he most excels in this role.Cate Blanchets performance as Hepburn whilst very likable seems to be somewhat over-acted, but nonetheless is very effective.Notable mentions must go to Alan Alda as the corrupt Senator Brewster. This is by far his best screen work to date. Also Alec Baldwin turns in another noteworthy performance following 'the Cooler'.Kate Beckinsdales role seems almost unnecessary within this film. I not really sure what she was trying to do with her role. I not sure a poorly acted Marilyn Monroe is what Scorsese was looking for in Ava Gardner.The story itself is quite an interesting journey to start with. Ultimately though this is a film that never quite gets anywhere. Not that there is anything wrong with how it all ends, it just seemed anti-climactic.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Dark and dour; a saga, not an epic...","Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biography flies high and mighty when it does indeed fly--down on the ground, it's aloof, cold and a little slow...and yet, one gets the impression Scorsese doesn't notice. He's an extremely self-satisfied filmmaker who doesn't bother to pick up the pace. When Hughes begins to deteriorate, the movie gets bogged down in the same red-tinged psychological muddle that doomed the entire midsection of ""New York, New York"". The period flavor--as with ""New York""--is careful but unsatisfying, and Leonardo DiCaprio is serviceable in the lead but nothing grander, nothing more than workman-like (his little boy voice strains throughout, cussing like a kid playing grown-up; his height doesn't detract, however, and his weight and demeanor seem correct). Cate Blanchett playing Katharine Hepburn is too fast at the beginning, but finds a more appropriate style; unfortunately, there's too much of her. Thelma Schoonmaker's lightning-fast editing fails her and Scorsese in this instance. We don't need to see Hepburn arriving at the movie studio, turning the lights on and meeting a handsome admirer. Whose story is this? The sequence around the Hepburn family dinner table is, however, a smash, and Blanchett is lovely in her period wardrobe. I didn't believe for a second the impersonations of Jean Harlow (very minor) or Ava Gardner (a big problem) ...and what happened to the ""Outlaw"" controversy? It seems to take place off-screen. The editing also slips up in the final third, allowing scenes to run on too long and letting shots get ahead of themselves (as with DiCaprio behind the wheel of the Hercules, seeming to turn the plane too early). Howard Shore's score is great, Robert Richardson's cinematography is terrific, but ""The Aviator"" is overall a disappointment; an expensive and good-looking lump of coal. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hughes should be a technological legend,"As a technocrat, I have followed the professional lives of the people that have made the modern computer industry. Individuals such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison and Elon Musk. They are hard-driving people that had great vision, but personalities and egos that were abrasive, to say the least. Much earlier, there was another person in this mold, and his name was Howard Hughes. This movie is an expression of his life, successes and failures.
DiCaprio puts forward a superb performance as the mercurial, yet brilliant Hughes. In watching the movie, it was easy to project some of what has been written about Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and simply replace Hughes with either of those two men.
Of course, there are two significant differences. The first is that Hughes was at his base a test pilot and a very good one. No one ever questioned his courage and willingness to take great personal risk. The second was that Hughes was also an integral part of the Hollywood movie making scene, which made him top notch fodder for the tabloids.
This is a great movie about one of the most underappreciated visionaries of the twentieth century. It is unfortunate that his great flaws were self-destructive, in the sense that they made it impossible for him to function in society in his last years. Had he remained socially and professionally functional, he may have been the greatest of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Seemed like a TV movie re-hash,"For all the 'Oscar buzz' one hears about this film, I came away rather disappointed. Why? 1. DiCaprio is a fine actor, granted. He does NOT possess the physical intensity that Hughes had, not to mention almost being the physical opposite. It'd be like Steve Martin playing James Dean. It's just WRONG. 2. For all the accolades Blanchett gets as Hepburn, she's somewhat of a caricature. Her accent was too over the top. What, did Scorcese think we wouldn't know who she was supposed to be? 3.I think an unknown as Hughes would have been a better idea, but then it might not have gotten the big box office receipts we're hearing about. And that's what's really at the bottom of this. I'll take the Tommy Lee Jones TV version any day!",,Anonymous,Biography
Has Martin Scorsese lost it?,"The master of the small movie apparently wants to be the master of the epic film. Unfortunately this is a tall order for anyone, especially for someone who hasn't made a particularly good film (small or epic) since 1990. But at least this time he is trying for a masterpiece and not just pissing away his time with garbage. There will be inevitable comparisons with ""Citizen Kane"" (in fact at one point in the film a reference is even made to W.R. Hearst) but anyone who does so should get a reality check. A more appropriate side-by-side comparison would be Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"", and this is a comparison that ""Aviator"" loses.Which is not to say that ""Aviator"" is a bad movie, although certainly it is bad history and is in need of major trimming, it is at least entertaining to watch. One wonders, however, if it will fare well enough at the box office to justify its epic expense. It has a relatively small initial target audience and nothing about the final cut makes one think it will generate word-of-mouth appeal from the wider population.There are a number of flying scenes and two are very good, the night landing on a golf course and the take-off of the Spruce Goose. There are also two that are very weak. The worst is the setting of a new speed record which has a serious continuity error, the plane on the runway was clearly not the plane in the error (bad pun intended). This was so obvious (one had a partial canopy and one had a full canopy) and they cut back and forth so much that I wondered if I was hallucinating the disparity-hard to believe that it was not handled better. The other was the crash of the spy plane in a Hollywood neighborhood. The cartoonish shots of various homeowners watching their houses being destroyed from the inside would fit a Cohn Brothers comedy but are totally out of place in this film.The film has one great performance, Cate Blanchette channels the vocal patterns and mannerisms of Katherine Hepburn, her scenes are the highlights of the film and fortunately she has a lot of scenes. It took a lot of courage for Scorsese to not just structure the film around someone as familiar as Hepburn but to have her character played in a manner where she was recognizable to her fans.Alan Alda does great as a slimy senator, Adam Baldwin is slick as thestrangely likable Pan Am President, Kelli Garner and the other Kate (Beckinsale) are dazzling decoration, and Ian Holm provides comic relief. Apparently Scorsese felt he needed this high caliber ensemble to compensate for miscasting the lead.And miscast he is; from DiCaprio's first line you know that this will be a painful experience; although perhaps not quite as horrible as you would expect from his prior work. Since Scorsese's break with De Niro after Cape Fear, both director and actor have suffered. You have to believe that the replacement DiCaprio takes direction well and that Scorsese is gambling that he can hit a home run with a weak actor and not have to share the credit for his triumph. But his strategy does not work as their screen version of Hughes utterly fails to capture any of the personal magnetism of their subject. I left the theatre thinking how well Titanic Leo executed the role, for his attempt was clearly earnest; but that almost any real actor could have brought nuances to the part well beyond the scope of DiCaprio's abilities-even under Scorsese's direction. The weakness of his portrayal is not as obvious when he is the only one in a scene but it takes on varying degrees of glaring when he is paired with one of the better members of the supporting cast.I kept coming back to Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ed Wood and wishing it was he who was playing Hughes. In real life Wood was a strange guy but almost one-dimensional when compared to Hughes. But if your only exposure to them was these movie biographies you would think that Wood was far more intriguing.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Insightful and well done,"Scorsese does it again with this period piece detailing the life of the eccentric millionaire Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio). The film opens with Howard directing his 1930 war epic, ""Hell's Angels."" Which took 3 years and 4 million dollars to make (not a small chunk of change back then, not even that small now). The movie moves to his meeting and subsequent courting of Katharine Hepburn, played exceptionally well by Cate Blanchett. It also depicts him moving on to the likes of Ava Gardner and Faith Domergue. ""The Aviator"" shows us the many aspects of Hughes' being, both good and bad. He is a dreamer, sparing no expense to make his movies or build his aviation empire, despite the financial trouble it causes the company which he inherited from his family that is based in Houston (the name of the company escapes me. We also see his obsessive compulsive nature, afraid of contracting germs and constantly trying to stay as clean as possible. When Errol Flynn grabs a pea off of Hughes' plat with a nice cut of meat on it, Hughes pushes it aside with only one bite gone. Also, Hughes is contracted by the government to make fighter planes and an ""air-boat,"" a giant airplane that can transport the troops, their equipment, and transportation across the Atlantic so that German u-boats will stop taking down U.S. submarines and ships. He call's it ""The Hercules."" The project takes too long, and it isn't completed in time to help in the war. Well, Hughes' new airline TWA doesn't amuse the big wigs at Pan Am Airlines, so their owner uses his personnel senator (Leon Brewster of Maine) to get a bill before Congress to put a monopoly on international aviation travel. Hughes takes on Brewster and his hearing and wins, then he takes the maiden voyage of his ""Spruce Goose,"" as Brewster called it, and retires the vessel forever. If you didn't know who Hughes was before this movie, then it will give you a great foundation on which to build knowledge of this quite intelligent, quite intriguing man. DeCaprio turns in a superb performance, further distancing himself from his teeny-bopper early years. He has definitely changed my opinion of him with his last three movies (Gangs of New York, Catch Me If You Can, and The Aviator). I realize he might have been good in earlier movies (though don't you dare say ""Basketball Diaries,"" which sucked), but I haven't seen them all.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Surprisingly, A Snooze","I didn't think it was possible, but Martin Scorsese has made a boring film -- a great big, gorgeously shot, beautifully art-directed bore, but a bore just the same. Howard Hughes and his involvement with advancements in aircraft technology and the Hollywood of the 30s and 40s ought to be a no-brainer. The fault is in the casting of Leo DiCaprio. He's a callow pipsqueak, who, while gifted as a child actor, has not made a satisfying transition to adult roles. Since ""The Aviator"" hinges on the personal magnetism of an obsessive and ultimately unhinged pioneer, this is a fatal flaw. First, there's the voice -- a crucial instrument for an actor -- and DiCaprio's nasal whine is rather sad. The depthless blue eyes don't help. Then there's the boobie face, with nary a character line (one furrow between his sculpted eyebrows doesn't count, although he works it with all his might). His petulant, furtive body language is like something displayed by a troubled teen in an after school movie. He does make an earnest try, thrashing around in naked desperation in a couple of scenes, and miming all the mannerisms of a soul afflicted with OCD, but it's all affectation. He's not much of an actor, and he's not a leading man.The audience with which I watched a preview gasped with delight when Kate Blanchett popped into the picture as a brutally bubbly Kate Hepburn, all swagger and need. She captured the actress and woman without turning her into a caricature -- no mean feat. The scene at her family's dinner table is a revealing look at the privileged Yankee eccentrics who shaped her.Once again, Alec Baldwin turns in a convincing performance as a high-powered bad guy, in this case the head of Pan Am, with Alan Alda, cast against type, as his unctuous henchman in Congress. John C. Reilly has nothing to do except wear fedoras, and and in her amazing jewel-toned wardrobe and jewelry, Kate Beckinsale is quite fetching as Ava Gardner. She's no Ava Gardner but that's not her fault -- nobody is.A handful of riveting action scenes pick up the pace of the story, especially a crash landing in Beverly Hills which nearly killed Hughes, then it's back to Leo, and the movie flags. I wanted to like ""The Aviator"", and I just didn't. I'm blaming DiCaprio.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great.,"There are few historical characters who live as intense and interesting as the eccentric and controversial Howard Hughes. He started by inheriting a tool company but his passion for aviation took him to other flights, much higher and more notable, making him one of the pioneers of aeronautics and, also, of spoken cinema. This film is truly luxurious in all aspects and is probably one of the films that will mark Di Caprio's career.The plot starts with Hughes' efforts to shoot ""Hell's Angels"", first as a silent film and then as a sound film, a super-production that cost him a lot of money. The film also shows Hughes' loving connections to renowned actresses like Katharine Hepburn or Ava Gardner, the US Senate's investigations into public money that he received in order to manufacture military planes that he never delivered, the creation and expansion of TWA Airline and, finally, the psychological disorder that Hughes suffered, and that were related to a serious form of phobia to germs and diseases.The film was expertly directed by Martin Scorsese and features a luxurious cast led by Leonardo Di Caprio, in one of the most interesting and rich roles of his career, which is already enviable at all levels. The actor worked hard and committed himself deeply to the psychological portrait of the millionaire who, little by little, sees his energy and entrepreneurship undermined by his growing phobia. Beside him is Cate Blanchett, in the role of the willful actress Katharine Hepburn. And here, honestly, I'm not sure what to think. I don't know Hepburn very well, I don't know if what Blanchett did was really true to the portrait of that actress, but I thought that sometimes it seemed a bit like a caricature. Anyway, she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, which should indicate something. Kate Beckinsale also makes an interesting appearance in the role of young Ava Gardner while Alec Baldwin and Ian Holm were good additions and did well with what was asked of them.Technically, the film has high production values and a lot of quality. Cinematography is excellent and there is a lot of CGI involved, always of good quality and very realistic. The film is essentially set in the 30s and 60s of the last century, so the sets and costumes rightly make an effort to respond to these changes and put on the right props. The soundtrack also deserves special mention because it not only has an epic and adventurous feel to it, but it is easily heard.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Romantic capitalism produces fine entertainment,"Marty Scorsese is a Hollywood director with a sense of history who knows how to make very watchable middlebrow commercial pictures. Here he tells the story of one of American capitalism's more romantic heroes in an entertaining and spectacular fashion while not overlooking the demons which drove him. Although this is a big budget production with some stunning aerial scenes it is essentially a character study of a true American eccentric.I'm not sure many mothers would like their sons to grow up like Howard Hughes but his Mom as depicted here certainly left him with a deep fear of germs. It is a curious feature of the story that despite being obsessed by germs Howard was happy to risk infection by sleeping with countless women and to risk his life flying experimental planes with great daring and gusto. Having lost both parents by the time he was 20, Hughes inherited a prosperous medium sized business which manufactured drilling bits for the oil industry and proceeded to build a huge ramshackle empire, including a film studio, an aircraft manufacturer and TWA, once America's largest domestic and second-largest international airline. He started out by nearly going broke making the World War I aviation epic ""Hell's Angels"", got interested in aircraft design, and constructed some pretty way-out craft, including the Hercules flying boat or ""Spruce Goose"" (framed from timber, aluminium being unavailable), then the largest plane ever to fly. It seems, incidentally that all this was funded by the US taxpayer and the lil' old Hughes Tool Company of Houston, Texas, which was the only part of Hughes's empire to consistently make money.And then there were the women. Wow. If ever there was a man who lived out his teenage fantasies it was Howard. He is shown here as an adroit seducer who meets his match in Katharine Hepburn, though they break up after she meets the love of her life, Spencer Tracy. One of the best scenes in the film is a lunch at the Hepburn family estate where Howard is confronted with the whole nutty Hepburn family, all of whom seem to have mastered the art of making outsiders uncomfortable. Then there is the beautiful Ava Gardner, who never seems to let Howard get too close, Jane Russell, the lady whose bra Howard famously designed for ""The Outlaw"" (who, still living, is mentioned only), and many others, some dangerously young, though it has to be said that Howard seems to have retained a mental age of 15 or so for most of his life.There are many fine performances in the film. Leonardo Di Caprico is a plausible, if very edgy Howard, and actually starts to look like him in the later Senate inquiry scenes (for a moment I thought they had slotted Sam Neil into the part). Cate Blanchett, burlier than the real Kate, powers her way through the part of Katherine Hepburn, tomboy. I really enjoyed Alan Alda, almost unrecognisable from his ""Mash"" days, as one of the villains, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, President of Pan American Airlines, and the other major villain, puts in an avuncular performance which relies a lot on his infectious grin, but it does not seem out of place. On the other hand Kate Beckinsale is a bit too perfectly dressed and too much in control as Ava Gardner  perhaps Marty is suggesting her as a mother figure in contrast to Cate's tomboy sister. Ian Holm was wasted in his minor role as the Prof and Jude Law was superfluous as Errol Flynn.It's a good story, though at 170 minutes the film is a bit on the long side, and I'm not going to take Scorsese to task for his historical inaccuracies. I wonder however whether the early signs of madness were so evident. Noah Dietrich, the very able executive portrayed by John C Reilly in the film was first employed by Hughes in 1925 and remained no. 2 in Hughes's empire until the late 1950s. In his 1977 memoirs, as I recall, Dietrich says Hughes really only started to fall apart in that decade, particularly after the failure of his marriage to Jean Peters, which falls outside the time frame of this picture. Scorsese for dramatic purposes has to give us a foretaste of what is to come, but it does have the effect of making Hughes seem nuttier than he actually was at the time. Still, this is all-round good entertainment which I'm sure is all Marty intended.Finally, a special mention for the set designers who, it seems, managed to turn the lobby of the Southwestern University Law School into a fair representation of the fashionable 30s' nightspot, the ""Coconut Grove"".",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Howard Hughes bio pic,"Howard Hughes bio pic, I get it. Hughes is very much the hero of the film, not its villain. He is, admittedly, a flawed hero, but then none of us are flawless- certainly not the heroes among us. He can be stubborn- for example, he insists on completing the Spruce Goose even after the military have cancelled their order and it should have become clear to him that there is no commercial future for the plane- and also ruthless, as when he blackmails a muckraking journalist who is threatening to publish a story about Hepburn. Throughout the film we are conscious of his struggles with the mental health problems- especially his paranoid fear of germs- that were to worsen in the latter part of his life. Nevertheless, we are always aware of the powerfully creative side of his personality, his flair for business and his combative spirit. This comes out most strongly at the end of the film when TWA's business is threatened by a Senate bill that would have given Pan-Am a monopoly on international air travel and Hughes is summoned to be interrogated before a Congressional committee about his business record. Hughes's enemies expect that he will be humiliated, but he is able to answer all the charges against him to such good effect that the bill is defeated. Leonardo di Caprio was excellent as Hughes. I must admit that I have not always been his greatest admirer; he struck me as an untalented pretty-boy when I first saw him in ""Titanic"", and there was little in ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""The Beach"" or ""Gangs of New York"" to persuade me to change my mind. He was, admittedly, better in ""Catch Me If You Can"", but this was a light-hearted film very different in style to ""The Aviator"". He seems, however, to be maturing into a very good actor and succeeded in bringing out the various sides of Hughes's complex personality. Of the other performances, the two that stood out were Cate Blanchett's impersonation of Hepburn and Alan Alda as Hughes's enemy, the corrupt senator Owen Brewster who is more interested in serving the interests of Pan-Am than those of his constituents.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Without name Scorsese and Dicaprio, would 'The Aviator' be praised the same?","The real-life figures and events are way more exciting. One of the disadvantages of biographical film: can you make film more interesting than already prominent figure or already dramatic affair. However, when the film is well-made with solid storyline, the sense of realism and relatability upgrades the quality exponentially. Howard Hughes is a subject that is worth delving into, such an interesting person. However, Scorsese makes him very boring with elongated and very one-dimensional story and slow pace. Hughes' mental illness can be emphasized in many other ways, and Scorsese does not have to make the movie peculiar as this one to achieve that. In addition, portrayal of Katharine Hepburn.... Cate Blanchett is so peculiar, awkward, and theatrical. Blanchett should act Katharine Hepburn as a person not her characters on the screen.Weird mixture of poor screenwriting, strange performances, vague ambiance, uncoordinated and unfocused development... just PECULIAR movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Classic but very rich,"Luxurious and vast film on the exceptional life of Howard Hugues. The budget is comfortable and allows for an ample production, including an impressive plane crash. The narration is very classic, chronological, which I regretted a little. The film, however, contains numerous visual and narrative moments that elevate it to a high level, for example a striking cut in the middle of a dialogue emphasizing the character's inherent madness or a very brief, astonishing flash-forward. The rise of Hugues' psychosis is well rendered, in parallel with his incredible energy and determination, and structures the interest of the film.

While not as motivated as the rest of them, I am of the opinion that this is Scorsese's best picture since Raging Bull.... At 166 minutes it does drag at times, and the 3D rendered scenes stood out more than I would have hoped, but the over the top performances (In a good way) of Leonardo and Blanchett were nothing short of riveting.

I've been inside the Spruce Goose, (It's presently in a museum in Northwest Oregon) so I went in expecting a lot...

"Not a flawless epic, and not Martin Scorsese's best movie, but a very good one.","Howard Hughes was the notorious playboy of the 1930s and '40s who wooed every Hollywood starlet in sight and was responsible for delivering aircraft to the United States government at the cost of $56 million. He ran well over-budget and never delivered any planes, although his monstrosity ""The Hercules"" -- at the time, the largest aircraft in the world -- was eventually built and did, in fact, fly.""The Aviator"" chronicles Hughes' life -- from his childhood to the point at which he first became obsessive about germs, his hands and so on and so forth. Hughes became increasingly eccentric and insane as time went on and by the end of the film I think Scorsese does something rather brilliant in terms of narrative effect -- I won't give it away but suffice to say it's a nice little conclusion to the movie.The movie itself is quite good but tries a bit too hard. The acting is top-notch and DiCaprio holds his own as Howard Hughes, proving once again he's more than just a pretty face. Cate Blanchett perfectly imitates Kate Hepburn and Kate Beckinsale is a great Ava Gardner.However I feel some material could have been cut. Some scenes really held my interest and I momentarily was lost in the film -- then there were sequences throughout which I felt bored and wished it would move on.Also, I found the subtitles (posted on the screen to introduce new characters, e.g. JOHN SMITH - FRIEND OF HOWARD HUGHES) a rather dubious element -- I expected better from Scorsese... introducing new characters with subtitles seems sloppy and far too easy for such a master filmmaker.I also felt ""The Aviator"" lacked Scorsese's overall typically energetic visuals, opting more for a bloated epic style -- one gets the feeling Scorsese was in it for the Oscar this year and was out to prove to the Academy that he could make a typical epic. There are a few tracking shots but other than that, it really didn't feel like ""A Martin Scorsese Picture."" On the plus side I found the cinematography quite nice, the musical score entirely fitting, the cameos amusing (Alec Baldwin, Willem Dafoe and Jude Law amongst others), and most of the dialogue believable.""The Aviator"" is not Martin Scorsese's best film, nor would I call it the best film of 2004. It is not flawless, but it does manage to entertain for the most part and is a solid insight into the life of Hughes. If I had one complaint, I'd say about thirty minutes altogether could have been edited out and replaced with more interesting material (or none at all), but as it stands, ""The Aviator"" is a very good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A new Scorsese classic,"Martin Scorsese's ""heroes"" usually aren't heroes at all; rather they end up being only one of the unbalanced characters through whom we see the entire film. Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation, Goodfellas, Casino, Bringing out the Dead and Gangs of New York--who would want to really be any of these guys? Even Jesus has issues.In the Aviator, Scorsese has made a slicker, more Hollywood friendly film, and it will likely be rewarded with Oscars for his more accessible approach. But the themes still remain: a troubled misfit attempts to shape the world to meet his wants, but the world is not his opponent--once again, it is his demons.There will be people who criticize this film because it's not as ""Scorseseque"" as most of his work, but come on, guys, not much has changed really. The editing and special effects might diminish the grittiness that permeates most of this great director's work, but Martin Scorsese is at his peak as a storyteller here; the film is three hours long but I didn't even know it until I looked at a clock after exiting the theatre. It feels like it plays in half that time--the movie is a very entertaining masterpiece about one of the most influential and complicated industrialists in American history; the man Howard Hughes was a true visionary, and dare I say in the world of aviation... apparently an artist. But like so many artists, this one is troubled, and DiCaprio plays him very, very well.I still liked Gangs of New York better, but this is a great movie and if it nabs Scorsese the key Oscars he has never called his own (Best Picture, Best Director) then he can finally fulfill that tiny blank space on his resume. If not, who cares? Scorsese doesn't need an Oscar to prove he's the greatest of all American filmmakers.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not Scorsese's Best, not even close.","Though certainly not a bad film by any means, it still is only Scorsese's fourth best film (his best is Gangs of NY, then Goodfellas, then Casino). I do think Leo deserves a nomination because he displayed the character excellently, especially the OCD (which i would know what it is like, because i have it), but I still think Colin Farrel deserves the win. Also Cate deserves a nomination because i thought she was Hepburn, but i also think Angelina deserves the win. I don't how ever think that Scorsese deserves a nomination because the film had many flaws, all having to do with direction and the story that he chose to use, if you were to say he deserved the nomination for Gangs of NY i would agree, i thought he should have won for that, maybe even Goodfellas, but definitely not this one, i'll be fair and give my reasons. First of all why did he put so many long dialog sequences with no score in the movie that had nothing to do with character, it was all about money and politics, and really i couldn't give a crap and a half less, also the drama suffers because of this wasted time and we learn nothing about the people other then they like money, also where was the score? i don't even think there was one, the drama suffers because of that too. Another flaw is the film is too long, I don't mind long movies, in fact i enjoy and prefer long movies, if it needs to be that long, because i feel a movie should be long to tell a whole story and be entertaining, but this one was easily 40 minutes too long, not that it couldn't be as long as it was, it just needs more to do with the characters, and less about money and who he was dating. There were only about 5 very interesting scenes all having do to with the actual aviation like the speed test, the crash (the best scene of the movie), the filming of hell angels, and the mental breakdown towards the end, which was even a little under acted and under played. It had very little, if not, no drama because we didn't learn anything about the characters, other then he had OCD, and they all wanted money. The story didn't feel like it was used, it felt incomplete, they was so much more they could have done, and it could have been very dramatic if there was a score, more character just in general at least, and if his mental breakdown had been more devastating then it was, i would think it deserved a best picture nomination, and even a director nomination, but since it was how it was, i don't think it deserves any other nominations then actor, actress, cinematography, and visuals. 7 out of a 10, barely.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful film and a must see!,"Truly a spectacular in the sense of capturing the essence of an age and of Hughes himself. While not factual in its day-to-day of Hughes' life, the film reveals the man in his genius, obsessions and eventual decline. Scorsese and DiCaprio are to be congratulated.The gorgeous and extraordinarily well-acted (by DiCaprio) movie moves through the highlights of Hughes' accomplishments in film and especially aviation. Without Hughes, American aviation would not be what it is today. His bold vision, deep pockets and ability to follow his grand dreams allowed him to create on an incredible scale.Howard Hughes was a American original as well as an American tragic hero.

Grand Theft Oscar: Scorsese gets robbed again,"The Academy must have had it in for Martin Scorsese. How could someone amass a resume that includes Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas (among others) and still not wrangle a Best Director or Best Picture Oscar? Here he delivered his best film since Goodfellas only to get stiffed yet again. (Luckily, he finally broke through a couple of years later with The Departed.)I knew very little about Howard Hughes before watching this film. I think that one of the things that makes this a good biopic is that it made me want to learn more about the man. It was quite interesting to see how Hughes's obsessive nature was a double-edged sword, spurring him on while crippling him mentally.As far as I'm concerned, this is Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance to date. The entire supporting cast is talented but DiCaprio is in another league altogether. Cate Blanchett also gives a stand-out performance, garnering a well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Katherine Hepburn.Scorsese's direction is impeccable, as expected, but the art department deserves special mention. The film landed Oscars for art direction, costume design and cinematography, all of which were well-deserved. The film really takes you back to a time and place, namely '20's to '40's Hollywood.I can't understand why this film isn't appreciated more.

"Bloated, devoid of human interest.","As demonstrated by the tedious ""The Gangs of New York"", Scorcese seems to be a spent force. Overwhelmed by large set pieces, we are left indifferent to Hughes' struggles. Scenes are left to play indulgently long, and, as well as endless captions telling us how much time has gone by, and where the scenes are taking place, characters are endlessly coming on and introducing themselves, and their relationships: ""Yes, Howard, I am Ava Gardner, and if you want to know if I slept with Arty Shaw, and whether I am interested in Frank Sinatra - the answer is Yes"" is a paraphrase of one of the more clunking bits of dialogue. Cate Blanchett merely mimics Katherine Hepburn's speech patterns and shouts a lot, while Jude Law wears a moustache, and keeps his eyes wide open, in an attempt to impersonate Clark Gable.Hughes crashing an aircraft is an excuse for Scorcese to indulge his taste for making sure that any damage to a human body is as explicit and unpleasant to look at as ever.Otherwise much effort has gone into recreating lavish evocations of period, and, interestingly, the overall effect is as unengaging as ""The Cotton Club"" was for Coppola. In the end if you don't have human interest in a script then you have nothing. Aviator is an expensive lesson for Scorcese, for Miramax, and, ultimately, for the audience that this remains a universal truth.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very long movie with disappointingly shallow depth.,"After seeing The Aviator, I disagree with the majority of people, who seem to adore the film. Its director, Martin Scorsese, is no doubt one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, but he has stumbled again with this film (following Gangs of New York).The film's begins by showing one puzzling scene of Howard Hughes' as a child being bathed by his mother and then it jumps to a scene showing Hughes as a young man directing a movie, Hell's Angels. This 'jumping' from scene to scene with little or no explanation happens quite often in The Aviator and I think it may have been necessary to keep the running time below 10-hours. Aside from Leo and Cate Blanchet, many other characters in the movie are introduced with subtitles or never introduced to the audience at all. It seems Scorsese thought anyone besides Hughes and Hepburn are not worth the director's efforts. The movie SEEMS to contain many interesting subplots: Hughes' interest in Hollywood movie-making, relationships with Katherine Hepburn, Eva Gardner, etc., his quest to build the fastest planes, battling PAN AM and corrupted politicians, building a corporate empire (dream), and fighting the inner demons, which eventually destroy's his life. However, none of the plots are explained with any interest and the story skims only the plots' surface with no effort to grab the attention of the audience (at least not mine).If an audience is not familiar with the life and times of Howard Hughes, Katherine Hepburn, Eva Gardner, and the evolution of commercial airlines in the U.S., then it is almost impossible to see any depth in this movie.Sure, the set designs and acting of Leo and Blanchet are above-par in the film, but most others aspects of this film are in such a mess! It seems as if Martin Scorsese (and the writer) assumed every audience coming to theaters to watch The Aviator would already be fascinated by Howard Hughes' eccentric life. The story in the movie has no beginning or and no ending! It starts abruptly and ends abruptly.Although the film spends nearly three hours concentrated solely on Howard Hughes' success and his inner demons of life, I walked out of the theater with a feeling that I've just watched an expensively designed movie with no real content. It really is a shame to spend that much money to make a movie that long only to miss the mark completely. Howard Hughes' life story must be very interesting to have drawn so much money and top talents, but then why is The Aviator so flat and boring? Well, it's simply a not well-made movie.I miss the RAGING BULL, GOOD FELLAS, CASINO, CAPE FEAR... and I wish Mr. Scorsese would go back to making highly entertaining movies with DeNiro. THE AVIATOR (and GANGS OF NEW YORK) is a sub-par quality by the director's great standard.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Visually stirring and ambitious biopic on legendary rebel billionaire Howard Hughes,"From the talented Martin Scorsesse comes an admittedly ambitious but compelling and visually stirring biopic on legendary rebel billionaire Howard Hughes. Although it is nearly three hours, I don't think the film dragged that much and I was gripped for the whole duration. My problem is to do with the secondary characters though. The Aviator is one of those films where a lot of detail goes into making the protagonist and a few more key characters convincing and relateable, but the secondary characters aren't given as much attention as well. This is not the first film to have this problem though, Kinsey which was still very good had it too, as did Chaplin. Back on target, actors like Willem Dafoe and Ian Holm are not given that much to do, they do fine with what they have, but their characters have the sense of appearing there one minute and disappearing the next. Another problem was that occasionally the drama was lacking, the story was well constructed and paced, and the themes here are very ambitious, but other than well staged plane scenes parts of the more dramatic parts felt somewhat lukewarm.Complaints aside, this is still a very good film. First of all, it is amazing to look at, the scenery is gorgeous and the costumes are sumptuous. The music is also a delight, beautiful and poignant, dramatic and haunting in others. I loved the small clips of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, orchestrated here and it works(it was originally written for organ you see), and Tchaikovsky's 5th and 6th Symphonies, the latter of which has a final movement that is so heart-rending as it always reminds me of death, don't ask why though. The Aviator is brilliantly directed by Scorcesse, and the script does have moments of meaningful power. And the acting is pretty exceptional. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his better post-Titanic performances here, he proves he is more than a person that is all looks no talent, for he really is brilliant as Howard Hughes. Cate Blanchett is wonderful as well as Katherine Hepburn, and Kate Beckinsale surprised me. Like DiCaprio, she too proves that she is more than a pretty face by giving a really good account of herself as Ava Gardner while looking absolutely amazing in the process. In a smaller role, Alec Baldwin was also enjoyable.Overall, not absolutely outstanding, but The Aviator is a very striking, ambitious and compelling biopic. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The drama recounts the years of his life from the late 1920s through the 1940s, an epoch when Hughes was directing and producing Hollywood movies and test flying innovative aircrafts he designed and created.It also follows his descent into madness as his compulsiveness for cleanliness gives way to frequent outbursts and ticks. He turns away those closest to him, confining himself and emerging only when absolutely necessary. The Aviator 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Grade: B+,"Leonardo DiCaprio IS Howard Hughes in the piece that should finally win Martin Scorsese that elusive Best Director Oscar.Hughes biopics have been floating around Hollywood for decades. And no wonder - the story of Howard Hughes is an excellent example of the American dream being followed through to its conclusion. Tremendous, unprecedented power, fame, success, and wealth, followed by a massive, nearly unprecedented crash-and-burn. What could be more quintessentially American? Of course directors and producers have been scrambling all over each other to be the first to put a summation of Hughes' life on screen. A competing project starring Jim Carrey and directed by Christopher Nolan has been rumored for some time, in fact. But Scorsese got his out first, and I can't imagine that Nolan's film could possibly be any better.For the uninitiated, Howard Hughes was one of the great eccentric geniuses of this century. He was a film producer and director, an engineer, a pilot, a hotelier, and a crazy, crazy man. He ended his life in the suite of his Las Vegas hotel, which he hadn't left in twenty years. By that time, he was receiving daily blood transfusions from Mormons, who he believed were the only clean people in the world. He was no longer trimming his fingernails or cutting his hair or beard. He wore tissue boxes on his feet, and a surgical mask at almost all times. Terrified of germs, Hughes barricaded himself in his hotel and died there alone, sad, and insane. This would seem to me to be the most interesting part of Hughes' life to film - watching his madness devour him alive.But no - Scorsese made the choice of allowing us to see Hughes in his younger, more vibrant days, and allowing us to watch the madness creep up on him instead.The film opens as Hughes is filming ""Hell's Angels"", now nearly universally lauded as a masterpiece. He's throwing money at it hand over fist, but it's a passion, so he doesn't care. Genius or insanity?That's what Scorsese and DiCaprio bring across more than anything else here - the line between the two is so thin, it can be invisible in some cases. It certainly was with Hughes.Eventually, Hughes gets into the airline business, founding TWA. He gets into a streetfight with PanAm, in the person of PanAm president Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin, enjoying being the bad guy) over who has the right to global flights. In between all the corporate and political intrigue, Hughes finds the time to fall madly in love with fellow outsider Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), and to dally with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). All along, Hughes struggles with his obsessive-compulsive tendencies, his most heroic moment coming when he overcomes his agoraphobia in order to testify before Congress (represented in the person of Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, a snarky Alan Alda) and save his company.Leonardo DiCaprio is the true savior of this movie, and Scorsese deserves credit just for getting out of his way. This is DiCaprio's chance to grow up as an actor, and he takes it and runs with it. It's difficult for a star of his caliber to be anything but Leo on screen, but he succeeds more than admirably in making you see Hughes instead of the movie star. He even comes to actually physically resemble the fortyish Hughes, a remarkable feat for a babyfaced thirty year old. It's a terrific performance, and one that should garnish Leo an Oscar nomination.Also notable is Cate Blanchett's Katharine Hepburn - her performance is jarring at first, seemingly over-the-top, but once you settle in and realize that that's really how Hepburn WAS, it becomes fascinating. Her relationship with Hughes is heartbreaking. It's a case of two Hollywood outsiders who can't get past each other's eccentricities - a great romance cut short by neurosis. To me, the segment of the movie that examines their relationship is the best part of the film.Overall, it's a slick and good-looking film, which is almost enough to get you past its shallowness. But DiCaprio and Blanchett are both wonderful.",,Anonymous,Biography
"The Life, Loves And Lunacy Of Howard Hughes","In what is surely his finest performance since ""Titanic,"" Leonardo DiCaprio manages to pull off a brilliant portrayal of the early years of the eccentric (and insane) multi-millionaire Howard Hughes. The first part of the movie deals with the filming and production of ""Hell's Angels"" - Hughes' motion picture about World War I aviators, and it served as an appropriate introduction to a movie that revolved around (as the title suggests) Hughes' fascination with aviation.DiCaprio is brilliant as he portrays Hughes' gradual descent into insanity. At first, as the movie opens, Hughes displays mild eccentricities (we would probably say today that he suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder.) DiCaprio manages to subtly show us Hughes becoming worse and worse until eventually he loses all touch with reality, managing to return to normalcy for a monumental battle with a Senate Committee over his airline's desire to begin transcontinental flights. Alan Alda was quite good in his role as Senator Brewster, the chair of the Committee, and someone in the pocket of the head of Pan Am Airlines (played by Alec Baldwin.) The depiction of the Senate hearing was brilliant, and left no doubt that Brewster - knowing of Hughes' fragile mental state - was an utterly beaten man, obviously taken completely off guard by a totally in control Hughes.The film depicts Hughes' various romances, focusing especially on those with Katherine Hepburn (Kate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), which served as an opportunity to show Hughes' growing paranoia. The last scene of the movie is particularly haunting to anyone who knows how Hughes' life turned out. The relationship with Gardner (and the role she played in getting him on his feet before the Senate Committee hearings) was especially interesting.I enjoyed the movie very much, although it seemed that it dragged a bit in places. Perhaps at times it became a bit too concerned with details (not unlike Hughes himself, actually) and, if we were going to get an almost 3 hour movie about Hughes, it might have been more satisfying to have less detail about these particular years and extend the movie into Hughes' later years. Perhaps fodder for a sequel. Having said that, this is a very good and very interesting movie, which I rate as a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best Film of 2004 to 2005,"I really think this is an exceptional film in every single way. It is very entertaining for everyone twenty plus, and covers an interesting period in American history between late twenties to end of Second World War. The general story is very interesting, Tracing Howard Hughes life with his connections in early Hollwood and his exceptional genius in aviation design. It captures an essential part of American History in a very real and interesting way - covering early Hollywood and its transition, early passenger aviation, political corruption (similiar to what we witness today!) The acting and directing is of the highest caliber. This film definitely deserves several Oscars and hopefully will get them All I can say is it is brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too long and not enough excitement,"There were some fine performances in this movie, and it reminded me of Citizen Kane in its approach to the life of a ruthless businessman, but I wasn't gripped by it and Hughes' character was so unsympathetic that I couldn't engage with him. Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Hepburn was excellent and I loved her (being a true Hepburn fan, I wasn't offended). I understood the technical excellence of the cinematography, but I need to feel involved in a story and Hughes behaviour was repellent enough to distance me completely. DiCaprio was good, but I couldn't see him as an older man later on in the story - possibly he lacked the weight required to show middle age convincingly. I lost interest well before the end, I'm afraid.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Brilliant,"The Aviator is amazing biopic about one of America's most famous figures, Howard Hughes, during his most exciting, innovative and formulative years in the 1920s to 1940s. During this period he was obsessively involved in first making a film and later Aviation, the biggest love of his life, where he faces opposition from a PanAm chief(Alec Baldwin) and a corrupt and power hungry Senator (Alan Alda). As well, his own Daredevil behaviour, unwavering idealism, brash decisions, and constantly growing Obessive Compulsive Disorder and Germaphobia throughout the film threaten to derail him.'The film is the shortest and most captivating 170 minute film I've ever seen. The screenplay, the editing and the sheer determination of the filmmakers in capturing this exceptional man on the screen make it a wonderfully gripping experience. It excels in every department, from design and FX to Howard Shore's great score.' Martins decision to imitate two strip technicolour (blue) for half the film is also interesting and looks great. Its a period piece that actually manages to portray the period perfectly,a historical epic, biopic that doesn't forget to engage the audience with heart and humour.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Howard Hughes and while he doesn't look like Hughes (and doesn't ""age"" well, At All), he manages to portray Hughes charm, arrogance, mannerisms, obsessions, recklessness and ""madness"" almost perfectly. However he is equally matched by Cate Blanchett in her Oscar winning role as actress Katherine Hepburn. Every Actor in the film is brilliant, though some are underused such as John C. Reilly.Overall this was a great and very enjoyable film. It has its faults but films that try to portray larger then life people always do. 8.5 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good if you're not hung up on accuracy,"I enjoyed this movie, though as a fan/scholar of classic films and pop culture history, I thought it missed the mark a lot. A few observations:Though he looks nothing like Hughes, I thought DeCaprio did a fine job. He was especially startling when portraying the older Hughes.I thought Cate Blanchett captured Katharine Hepburn pretty well. Maybe three times I heard an ever-so-slight trace of Australian accent (actually, it sounded rather southern U.S.!) that marred the New England aspect. I was kind of bothered by the portrayal of her family; I don't think they were rich and snobbish; just liberal and eccentric.No one ever looked like Ava Gardner, nor could hope to, but I thought Beckinsale did a fair job of evoking her personality.The costumes were stupendous, but the chronology of the music was all outta whack. The choices and the authenticity of the reproductions were great, and yet we were hearing early 1930s recordings (and renderings of music in that style--e.g., ""Happy Feet"") when it was already the mid-thirties. The mid/late thirties were skimmed with a Benny Goodman tune, and the 1940s suddenly seemed to explode on the scene without transition. Then in 1947 we hear Glenn Miller's ""Moonlight Serenade,"" a hit from many years before that was no longer in style by 1947. Nitpicky, you say? Mebbe, but would it have been that difficult to get it right?I didn't know that much about Hughes, but I was aware that he didn't go into the reclusive/not-emerging-from-his-room mode until the 1950s.But, hey--what biopic ever got it right? This was an entertaining movie. Well-made in many ways. Long. As Lina Lamont would say (chirpily) ""I liked it!""",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not Scorcese's best film,"Not Martin Scorcese's best film. Almost cartoonish with over rich colors and overacting. However, the costumes and sets were wonderful. Short and baby faced Leonardo DeCaprio was grossly miscast and seemed to know it and consequently overplayed his part and his squeaky voice grated. Only during the Senate hearings in 1947 did he look like Howard Hughes. John C. Reilly always succeeds and was great as Noah Dietrich. Alec Baldwin was terrific as Juan Trippe, the head of Pan American Airlines, and Alan Alda was just fantastic as Maine Senator Ralph Brewster, the corrupt Republican (are there any other kind?) in the pocket of Juan Trippe and PanAm. Cate Blanchett could not have been better as Katharine Hepburn. Kate Beckinsale was okay as Ava Gardner but didn't have the cachet. The movie ended with Hughes' descent into madness in 1947-1949 and did not include any of the scenes of the Sands Hotel days when he had long fingernails and long hair. He owes his obsessive compulsive disorder to his mother, who ""washed"" his penis when he was an adolescent, which is the disturbing and totally unnecessary opening scene.The best parts of the movie were (1) fantastic airplanes and old cars throughout, (2) Hughes' amazing survival of a spectacular crash of an experimental plane into palatial homes in Beverly Hills, (3) the takeoff and flight of the Spruce Goose, (4) the Senate hearings, (4) the night time flight over LA with Hughes romancing Hepburn, (5) dinner with Katharine Hepburn's family in New England, and (5) the crash landing of another experimental plane in a beet field. Worth it just for those scenes. The film was marred by about 30 to 40 minutes of boring scenes that seemingly would never end of Hughes going mad, urinating into milk bottles, compulsive hand washing, muttering to himself, etc.Certainly not a film to see a second time, which is always the mark of a good film for me. A movie nearly 3 hours long can not drag and this film sure as hell dragged. With the exception of Alda, Baldwin, O'Reilly and Blanchett, most of the young actors and actresses had no idea who they were playing. The film failed to show the importance of Hughes's role in the aviation, oil and film industries.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fly high with this historical gem,"Some people say you can't be born a legend, you can only become one. Well, I think in the case of Martin Scorsese, it's a little bit of both. You see, when you're watching a Scorsese film, you're watching movie-making at its best. No detail is left behind in his films which is just one of the many reasons why Scorsese is one of my favorite directors in Hollywood. Over the years Scorsese has put out some masterpieces and although he has won numerous awards for his work, he has yet to hold the coveted Oscar statuette in his hand. A couple years ago when GANGS OF NEW YORK was being promoted, everyone thought it would be the one to give Scorsese his first Oscar, but as most of us saw, that didn't happen. Instead we saw the much acclaimed musical CHICAGO take home the gold. Two years later, we find Martin Scorsese to be in the same exact position, only it's with THE AVIATOR now. Will the same fate hit Scorsese again with Adrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, yet another musical? Or will the academy finally award him for not just his magnificent work on THE AVIATOR, but for everything he has brought to movies over the past 30 years?This film is loosely based on the life of Howard Hughes, one of the first true millionaires of America. Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio), who was only a teenager when he inherited his family's tool business, had dreams that most of us couldn't even begin to think of. One of his dreams was to make a motion picture, which he did with HELL'S ANGELS, a film that not only introduced Hughes to Hollywood, but introduced him to such movie starlets as Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). Having always had a love of aviation, Hughes decided to build the world's fastest plane during the making of HELL's ANGELS, a project that proved to be successful one clear day in 1935. After being dubbed the ""world's fastest man,"" Hughes decided to broaden his spectrum of wealth by purchasing the airline company TWA (TransWorld Airlines). He even began to build a special spy plane for the government, but all was not well in Hughes mind as time passed by. After being dumped by Hepburn, a new enemy arrived for Hughes, Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), president and CEO of America's leading airline PanAm. And Trippe, with politicians on his side, set out to destroy not only TWA, but Hughes himself leading the great aviator to fight mental demons he never thought he would have; demons that would eventually leave the pioneer at rock bottom. But, just when you think Hughes has no fight left in him, he picks himself back up and somehow manages to rise to the top again in a fashion that could only be expected from Howard Hughes.Ever since GANGS OF NEW YORK, I had the feeling that we would see Scorsese and DiCaprio team up again, but who would have guessed it would be DiCaprio coming to Scorsese instead of the other way around? As it turns out, DiCaprio is a huge Howard Hughes fan, so when he gave the idea to Scorsese, how could the great director refuse? Well, I'm confident that Scorsese sees something in young Leo, which is probably why he agreed to direct the film. Scorsese allows his young actor to pretty much open up his talents, which couldn't have been a better decision. Going back to WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, I could see the endless potential DiCaprio, but I would never expected such a performance like the one he turned in for THE AVIATOR. He truly became Howard Hughes inside and out balancing the true nature of what made Hughes a legendary industrialist and pioneer. But, DiCaprio was not the only star in this film; he had some great talent around him led by Cate Blanchett, who just seems to get better with time. Blanchett, who played Katherine Hepburn, captured the true essence of why Hepburn was a marvel in Hollywood. And then there was Kate Beckinsale, who did a tremendous job in playing Ava Gardner, the new and upcoming star of the times. Beckinsale, who most people will remember from PEARL HARBOR, in my mind, is starting to come into her own as an actress. Only time will tell us how great she actually becomes. But, the one guy that many will forget from this film will be Alec Baldwin, who played the evil PanAm CEO Trippe. Even though Baldwin doesn't occupy much of the films 168 minute running time, his presence is known in every scene in which he appears, reaffirming his talent as being the best among his brothers.Many critics will downplay this film because it drags and it's too long. And, although I do agree that the film felt longer than it was, that's one of the aspects that I come to appreciate with a Martin Scorsese film. I mean, going in I know it will feel like a 6-hour film, but I don't care. In fact, I look forward to it because there's no other director in Hollywood that can do the things that Scorsese does behind the camera, and no other director that can bring in the type of emotion that Marty can bring. He may spend more time on scenes, but every detail is played out which ultimately makes his films complete. And in THE AVIATOR, Scorsese has clearly done just that bringing in all the emotion and features that made Howard Hughes who he was.I don't know what the future holds for THE AVIATOR, but if my predictions are right, it will be covered in gold. Not only did Martin Scorsese capture the true essence of Howard Hughes and what he meant to this country, he allowed Leonardo DiCaprio to run with the character which ultimately left no stone unturned.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Aviator: 7/10,"I can't really talk about Martin Scorsese's directorial credentials, as I've only seen three of his movies: Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and The Aviator. All of them have the same rating-why is that? Maybe it's Scorsese's inability to keep those movies under two hours (The Aviator clocks in at about three with previews), or since those three movies dealt on real people, did Scorsese and his screenwriters get their life stories wrong? Whatever the case is, they're all good, but maybe I'm just not able to appreciate everything Scorsese does. It's been two years since Leonardo DiCaprio's last role in Catch Me If You Can. He's not what everyone made him out to be after Titanic; he's no longer just an idol of teenage girls. Instead, he's proved himself to be a fine actor, one that's perfect to play Howard Hughes.In the beginning of the movie, Howard Hughes (DiCaprio) is working on directing a huge epic movie. We have no backstory to him, which may have caused trouble later on. There's no telling of how he got his massive fortune, but I digress. He works for three or four years on his picture Hell's Angels, making it the most expensive movie at that time. The movie follows Hughes through his his tumultuous movie career, pioneering aviation career (such as buying TWA), his relationships with Katharing Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), and his insanity (spoofed brilliantly on The Simpsons, I might add). You'll also see Jude Law as Errol Flynn (in his sixth, and final, role of late 2004).For its almost-three-hour runtime, The Aviator seemed to go by rather quickly. We have the great Howard Shore score, which is sometime mixed with music from the era, to create an odd-but interesting-effect. Scorsese's direction is great in some parts, but not in others. In the crash sequence, Scorsese finds ways to build up the tension (although the interior of the houses we see look quite late-1990s...), even though we know there's still at least an hour to go in the movie, yet when it comes to the tail end of the movie, when we see Hughes in all of his insane glory, we don't really see how he progressed from a mid-case OCDer to this completely delusional psycho. It's a complete transition. Although we do get a sense that Hughes is becoming more mentally unstable, it's just completely from left-field, and maybe instead of 15 minutes of showing how different he is from the Hepburn family, Scorsese could have showed what pushed him over the edge or something like that.The movie looked pretty good. The cinematography was pretty good; it's probably the one Oscar that this movie is a shoo-in for. There's DiCaprio's acting, which'll be nominated, but won't win (obviously, Jamie Foxx for Ray). DiCaprio obviously studied Hughes and his mannerisms, and does a good job pulling him off, but can anyone compare him to what Hughes was really like? Acting out someone who no one remembers (personally) is kind of a cop-out for not having to do a top-notch acting job (see, Foxx didn't have it that easy for Ray Charles). Yet he still did a good job, and threw off any lingering ""King of the World"" thoughts that people had about him. Blanchett is quickly rising on my favorite actress list-this and The Life Aquatic back to back, great in both. There's John C. Reilly, who's a good actor, but whose voice is so damn recognizable it's hard to consider him a powerhouse actor. And Alec Baldwin. Remember when, in South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, the Baldwins' house, and everyone was happy? They were happy because Alec Baldwin couldn't play a character named JUAN! That's like Johnny Depp playing Fat Albert. It just doesn't work.The Aviator is an entertaining movie. Sure, it drags for a bit, and is unnecessarily long, but it's never boring. It's by no means the year's best biopic (that goes to Ray), but it's an entertaining one.My rating: 7/10 Rated PG-13 for thematic elements, sexual content, nudity, language and a crash sequence.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Marvelous.,"When it comes to film, my love is primarily focused on two things. I can be swayed and amazed by brilliant metaphors and symbolisms and fantastic technical aspects, but a film is nothing to me without two key ingredients. First, I need power in the performances. Be it subtle inner pain or explosive intensity, it's practically impossible for me to love a film if it doesn't feature some great performances or at least a brilliant one in the lead. Secondly, and most importantly, is the story. The thing I love most about film is the ability it has to immerse me into a story and take me on a journey outside of my own world. Be it through wild comedic adventure, an action-filled extravaganza, a deep, emotional story about characters or a powerful epic drama, I have to love a story to love a film. Luckily for me, The Aviator features a magnificent story of a very complex individual and is anchored by one of the finest performances I've ever seen in the form of Leonardo DiCaprio. While it does have flawless technical aspects (including a score that never ceases to amaze), the film is founded on these two elements. As you well know, Scorsese's film tells the story of the infamous Howard Hughes who led a life full of beautiful women and a huge amount of money to do whatever he pleased with. Hughes decided to put this money towards his huge ambition and his love for film and, more importantly, aviation.As the film begins we see him working on his debut feature, Hell's Angels, which proudly portrayed his love for the sky and the planes that glide through it. Throughout the production he's met with an enormous amount of obstacles from money troubles to plane troubles to having to reshoot the entire picture because by the time it was finished, the era of silent films was over. We progress through the prominent stages of Howard's life and along the way, Scorsese shows us everything about his life from his relationships with beauties like Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) to his battles with severe mental issues ranging from OCD to bipolar disorder and potentially paranoid-schizophrenia; and all of this is portrayed exceptionally while in the background his aviation empire rises, falls and rises back again and his film career is met with constant turmoil. Scorsese manages everything perfectly so that the viewer is always aware of what's currently on screen, what's happening that we aren't seeing and what has driven the story up to the point we are currently at. It flows at a perfect pace, never going to quickly for the viewer to catch up and never dragging throughout it's almost three hour running time.Scorsese's direction is perfect as he creates, in my opinion, what is easily his best film since Taxi Driver and one of the finest films of the decade. The film shares a lot of similarities to Scorsese's other widely acclaimed biopic, Raging Bull, and one of the key similarities is that the film is anchored by a wildly intense, unstoppable performance; in this case coming from Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking on someone as complex as Howard Hughes would be an immensely difficult task for any actor, especially one as young as DiCaprio, but Scorsese firmly believed in his abilities (the two previously worked together on Gangs of New York) and his decision pays off in a way that I couldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams. DiCaprio's power is stunning, his absorption into the character goes beyond anything one could have expected and he ultimately creates one of the finest performances I've ever seen. A raw, brutally intense portrayal that perfectly encompasses the legend that is Howard Hughes in a film that tells his story admirably and never cuts corners. Scorsese and DiCaprio both create what is bound to be one of the highlights of their careers and certainly is one of the highlights of this incredible decade of film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting movie that just suddenly ends...,"Interesting biographical film portraying the early, highly successful years of Howard Hughes before his problems with obsessive compulsive disorder destroyed his mind. The film does a great job of portraying Hughes passion for aviation. You get a very strong impression of his energy and ambition and how it made him so successful. One great scene is where Hughes has dinner with Katherine Hepburn's family. All parties at the table are rich with no need to work again but the contrast could not be greater between Hughes' unrelenting ambition to work and and further aviation in general and the Hepburn family's lifestyle of perpetual relaxation.The problem is that the film doesn't seem to go anywhere and the ending is very unsatisfying. The film shows Hughes' rise to power, how he flouted all popular conventions of common sense and won, how he built up his business and how he positioned TWA airlines to become a world class airline. But then, just when he appears to have won in his quest to build an international airline, his personal OCD problems take hold, leaving his future in doubt. The film all of a sudden ends at this point and there's no explanation for what followed.From the way the movie ends, it seems to imply that if OCD hadn't taken hold of him, Hughes would have become one of the most powerful men in the airline industry worldwide as the owner of an international class airline and as a builder and supplier of military aircraft. It almost seems to imply that his OCD is the reason the ""Spruce Goose"" never became a success. Unfortunately, it's only an implication and no real explanation is provided.The acting was pretty good throughout. I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent as Hughes and Cate Blanchett does a great Katherine Hepburn. Overall, pretty good but not quite best picture quality. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

However, the image this movie constructs of the great modern eccentric Howard Hughes is fascinating.The film is also emotionally powerful. The way the movie depicts Hughes' degenerative mind is haunting. We see the tics evolve, eventually dominating Hughes' personality. It is interesting to indulge in the guided observance of the effects these eccentricities had in Hughes' relationships with other people as both impressive and sad.

"It may not be his best, but it's damn good","Despite its many Oscar nominations, I hadn't heard a lot of great things about the film prior to seeing it. That is why I was very pleasantly surprised when, while watching ""The Aviator"" I was met with what I feel is a truly great film. There are so many things involving the film that could be construed as personal negatives for me: (and more about most of these later in the review) I am not a DiCaprio fan, though I do recognize his talent, I can't stand Kate Beckinsale, and frankly, a 3 hour biopic on someone like Howard Hughes is not a very compelling subject for me. What got me into the theater was that it was a Best Picture contender and ultimately, it is a Martin Scorcese film. I was recently criticized as someone who would only dislike a film by a director I appreciate and follow if it was sheer crap, basically suggesting that I am such a fan girl that I can't discern whether something is good or not, simply because I may idolize a particular director. This is categorically untrue, but a good test of this would have been ""The Aviator"". I am a Martin Scorcese fanatic, and though I have not seen his entire filmography, there are certainly some films I like better than others. ""The Aviator"" was a film that I was afraid was going to be in the ""others"" category, but more importantly, I was afraid that it was going to be nothing more than mediocre, and that Scorcese who is LONG overdue for an Oscar (one of the only things that keeps this in check is that neither Kubrick nor Hitchcock won one either) was going to finally win recognition from the Academy based on his work for this film. About an hour into the picture, however, my fears were assuaged because ""The Aviator"" is truly a great film.Scorcese's direction is brilliant; he captures the spirit of the time, from the vibrant colors to the lush costumes, to the garish and (almost scary) club performers. ""The Aviator"" is as close to an epic as one can get without donning a gladiator helmet or parting the Red Sea. Scorcese messed with some special effects in ""The Aviator"", something that he hasn't played with too often. One scene in particular, where he is in a plane filming scenes for his film ""Hells Angels"" is absolutely breathtaking. The sets in ""The Aviator"" were huge, the party and premiere scenes were electrifying, and the cast (literally a cast of hundreds, if not thousands) was headlined by some good actors. DiCaprio really was fantastic as Hughes; physically, he didn't seem to embody Hughes until his later years, but I personally don't consider that to be a necessity  look at Hopkins in ""Nixon""; he looked nothing like the man, but his mannerisms spoke volumes. Particularly when DiCaprio was able to chew some scenery during scenes involving Hughes' mental breakdowns, I felt that he not only didn't overact, but he solicited a distinct air of sympathy for the character. (Except for the few people around me who found his episodes humorous, apparently.) ""The Aviator"" is headed by a great actor, and features many excellent performances by supporting actors, but the real standout for me was Cate Blanchett in the role of Katherine Hepburn. Having been a lifelong fan of Hepburn's (particularly of her early work) it took about a minute of Blanchett's performance for me exclaim, ""She's fantastic!"" Contrary to an opinion of one of my fellow theater attendees, Blanchett doesn't just mimic Hepburn, she literally becomes her. If she doesn't win the Oscar for this role (after having been so deserving for her role in ""Elizabeth"" as well) I will be shocked and dismayed.Of course, there are no perfect films, and ""The Aviator"" is far from perfect. I have never been a fan of the vintage-sounding nasal voiced narrator who appears to be reading items for a news brief on the radio, and Scorcese uses this a lot in the film. By about the third use (out of about 30 uses) I was getting pretty irritated. Though I realize that this is a pretty standard technique in period pieces, it still is annoying and derivative. I also was particularly dismayed by Beckinsale's depiction of Ava Gardner. Beckinsale, who is a homogenous and mediocre (at best) actress in the first place, managed to mess up her really small role by giving Gardner a weird Hungarian sounding accent. Perhaps I am not fully schooled in Ava Gardner's history, but I don't recall her sounding like one of the brides of Dracula. If I'm wrong about Gardner, I'll be happy to retract that criticism, but the performance was still lackluster.Sure, Scorcese should have won the Oscar for ""Raging Bull"". Probably for ""Goodfellas"" as well. But as easy as it is to want to give someone an Oscar based on their past offerings, it isn't fair to that person or their peers if this occurs. (It would be like if Kubrick got an Oscar for ""Eyes Wide Shut"".) Thankfully, ""The Aviator"" is deserving on its own, and if Scorcese gets the statue (finally) he will have earned it fair and square. ""The Aviator"" is a long film, but with its great pacing, it didn't seem like it. I give the film a very solid 7/10, possibly subject to change if the film holds up in the ensuing years.--Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Simply put, it's a great movie","The movie starts off light and, in my opinion, is not particularly excitingAbout halfway through the movie, I was thinking of stopping it. However, I'm glad I didn't, as it became an engaging film from that point on.A bit more details
The film chronicles the early life of Hughes, from the late 1920s to the 1940s, highlighting his accomplishments as an aviation entrepreneur and movie producer. The movie shows Hughes' passion for flying and his determination to build advanced aircraft. It also touches upon his personal life, including his romantic relationships and struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good, not great, Scorsese","The first 10 minutes of ""The Aviator"" are more exciting and emotionally gratifying than the entirety of Martin Scorsese's previous epic, ""Gangs of New York"" (2002).You gotta hand it to Scorsese. The man learns from his mistakes.After casting the pretty, but talentless, Cameron Diaz in ""Gangs of New York"" and watching that turn into a wretched film - sorry, Daniel Day-Lewis' commanding performance aside, that film's positively dull - he thought better when it came to casting ""The Aviator."" Yes, he cast beautiful women in this, too. But he found beautiful women who are also incredibly talented. Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale.Not that ""The Aviator"" doesn't have its attractive actress with unproven talent. Scorsese cast singer Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow, but then wisely gave her just two lines of dialogue in the entire film.""The Aviator"" actually seems like two films. The first part deals with Howard Hughes' (Leonardo DiCaprio) obsession to make movies and with gorgeous women. The second part delves into Hughes' fight with Pan Am and Congress, and his better-known obsessive behavior - collecting and storing his urine in jars, for instance - that turned him into the world's most famous recluse.The first part is interesting. The second is not.After a brief, rather Oedipal prologue that foreshadows Hughes' odd behavior later, writer John Logan gets right into the Hughes' adult life. Scorsese cuts to the chase, showing us the first year of the filming of ""Hell's Angels"" (1930).The entire sequence about ""Hell's Angels"" is not only fascinating but also breathtaking when Scorsese takes to the skies to show the filming of the WWI dogfights in the film. The spectacular aerial fight alone proves what a master filmmaker he is.About 30 minutes into the film, we meet Katharine Hepburn, played marvelously by Australian actress Blanchett, and the film takes off. Blanchett completely dominates the screen. She captures every nuance of a young Hepburn. Her Hepburn's got spunk, attitude, charisma and you forget you're watching Blanchett. Hers is one of 2004's best performances.Later, we get another pleasant surprise - young Beckinsale as screen siren Ava Gardner. After the wretched ""Van Helsing,"" it's good to see Beckinsale putting her talent to better use. She may not be physically built like Gardner, but she carries off the role with poise and panache. She's thoroughly believable as the legendary actress.""The Aviator"" would've benefited greatly had it concentrated more on the Hughes-Gardner relationship and less on Hughes' eccentricities.In fact, it's those two women who keep the film interesting. When they leave the story, the film falls flat. The other characters are not nearly as interesting as these two women and it's to these actresses' credit that they so completely take over a film that's not about their characters.There are some fine supporting performances. Alec Baldwin's turned into a good character actor and the always-brilliant Ian Holm makes it all look so easy as Professor Fitz. There's a sensationally funny bit when Hughes forces Fitz to pose as a mathematician to prove to movie censors that Jane Russell's cleavage in ""The Outlaw"" (1943) isn't all that revealing.Chances are, Scorsese will win the Oscar. He deserves a nomination, but I don't know whether he deserves to win for this movie. If he does, I'm certain it would be because Oscar voters were too dumb not to reward him for directing ""Raging Bull"" (1980) and ""GoodFellas"" (1990).My enjoyment of ""The Aviator"" boiled down to one person - Cate Blanchett. Oh, what a tremendous difference real talent makes.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Enough for an Oscar?,"There is always a little extra excitement involved when seeing a movie that has had a lot of buzz about it before reaching Sweden. And ""The Aviator"" is such a movie. Not least because most people are wondering if this is the movie that will finally give Martin Scorsese his Oscar for best director.This is the story of millionaire Howard Hughes. The man who started out with a tool company, began his film-making career with the worlds most expensive film and then went on to become a pioneer in aviation. A story about a manic and intense individual, a man of great success but also one who lived constantly on the edge. And not only is this movie about his life's work but also about his turbulent personal life and the many women he loved.Martin Scorsese has long been a man with a distinct feel when it comes to style. And that is very noticeable here. ""The Aviator"" is a beautiful film with a lovingly created world, intense pictures and astonishing sound and music. A delight for the senses. But the movie is also well played with a huge cast of well known and talented actors in both big and small parts. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as Howard Hughes, but the strongest star of the movie is still Cate Blanchett. She steals every scene she graces with her appearance.The story of Howard Hughes is fascinating. Not the least because he himself was a fascinating man, but also because of all the famous people that he crossed paths with. Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Erroll Flynn Scorsese treats Howard Hughes with a certain respect, but he doesn't shy away from his less flattering sides. This also means that Scorsese steers away from making an idolized portrait and the movie feels more real, Hughes never feels like a saint.So, about the Oscar. Will this be enough for the ""Best director""-Oscar? My guess is no, unfortunately I believe that Scorsese will once again fall short. That however doesn't mean that this is a bad movie. Far from it. ""The Aviator"" is well directed, well played, interesting and entertaining. A recommended viewing, I rate it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
What's the big deal?,"It was a so-so movie...but why all of the Oscar buzz? It wasn't that great of a film.

I'm really tired of poor movies being produced...remakes galore!! Has the movie industry run out of creative people? Anyway, Leo seems to do better when he is portraying biographic figures. And the casting for the supposed ""look alike"" stars was annoying! I know you can't really find another Flynn or Hepburn but I found their characters really distracting. I just wonder if there wouldn't have been a better way to deal with Hughes private life? 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Eccentric,"This is a good film, not the best, but still very good. Leonardo Di Caprio plays Howard Hughes very well, but the best performance was by Kate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn, the good thing was that she had lots of material to draw on to create that performance. The film quality is excellent and the period costumes, scenery and make-up were spot on, the secret of making a good ""real story"" movie is to make it as real and as close to how it was when the events took place, and it was very realistic. The direction was superb, it was a long film at 2 hours 50 mins, but it could have been longer, apparently scenes were cut, including one with ""Amelia Earhart"", and I think it would have benefitted from being longer, because the main character had such an interesting life. Because it was edited so much the continuity suffered, but that did not affect the quality. A cameo by Jude Law as ""Errol Flynn"" was also good, and realistic, actor characters such as Errol and Spencer Tracy could have featured more. But the best angle to the movie was Howards role as an Aviation Designer and Pilot, hence the title, and being the main subject of this part of Howard Hughes life.Please make more films like this.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
My brief review of the film,"A technically very well made film, helped by some fine acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Alan Alda, it is nevertheless is not at all perfect viewing. Whilst the film is quite a satisfactory biopic, depicting Hughes' experiences well, it never feels deep at all, even though it tackles deep issues. The film just simply does little else other than show Hughes' life, and although that was the point of the film, it feels just a bit too lacking for it to be worthy of a second viewing. At almost three hours in length it feels much too long, and with almost all the supporting characters underdeveloped, it has little other than just its flashiness to hold one's interest. For the technical credits, which are very impressive, and for Leonard DiCaprio's solid performance, the film is worth watching. However I find little to recommend it as a film for which more can be taken out of it with a second viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

His life long phobias and his obsessive-compulsive disorder would cause him to exile himself from friends, lovers and business stalwarts. The world he once believed to own would become a secret world unto himself. Most interesting is his relationships with Katharine Hepburn(Cate Blanchett), Jean Harlow(Gwen Stefani)and Ava Gardner(Kate Beckinsale). Alan Alda plays Senator Ralph Owen Brewster.

3 Hours does not an Oscar winner make,"I went to see this film with great anticipation.

That having been said, I was still enjoying the film through the first hour, staying with it through the second hour and completely losing it through the third hour. This was one of those films that less would be more. Three hour movies become extremely tedious to the average movie goer, the same as double headers did to baseball fans. This movie could easily have been cut by 40 minutes and would not have damaged it at all. I thought DiCaprio did a fairly decent job of playing Hughes all though others I have spoken with all felt he was a bad choice. I also thought that Cate Blanchett nailed Kathryn Hepburn, both in looks and in sound. John C. Reilly did his normally excellent performance as I have come to expect from him and Alex Baldwin was fine as Juan Trippe. One of the highlights of the movie were the special effects. I would recommend the film only if you know going in of it's length. I will say it again, 3 hours is too long for a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Aviator....Lives up to the hype,The day after this film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards I decided to go see it in the theater to see what all the fuss was about. I was disappointed by Scorsese's previous film and was expecting this one to be the same ploddingly well shot film. Thank god it wasn't. This film hits all cylinders and never misses a beat. ALL of the actors do a fantastic job especially Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn. The film however revolves around Howard Hughes and we see his highs and his lows. The Aviator has throwback feel and look to it complemented by special effects that weave their way into the film seamlessly. At just under three hours long its is paced well and the time goes by without dragging. It really is a good film that deserves all of the attention that it is getting and I recommend it to everyone.Grade: A,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Scorsese no longer great, now just good","To a certain degree, all biographical films are as successful as the audience's knowledge of the character. That has never been more true than with 'The Aviator.' I walked into Martin Scorsese's epic knowing little about the bizarre tycoon Howard Hughes, therefore I walked out reasonably satisfied. To those who have studied Hughes, I wonder if their reaction to the film will involve shrugged shoulders.There is a depressing quality to 'The Aviator' that enters as baggage that has nothing to do with the film at all. I watched 'Gangs of New York' recently for the first time and disliked it entirely. Scorsese's newest work is considerably better but leaves a bitter taste still.While watching Leonardo DiCaprio finely portray Hughes, I remembered Scorsese's earlier work. He is the master of presenting the anti-hero. I was reminded of the chief characters in 'Raging Bull' or 'Taxi Driver.' The success of his films, to a large degree, fall around the stories encircling his troubled stars. Look, for instance, at the backdrop of 'Goodfellas.' Everywhere the Ray Liotta character goes, he is in a perpetual state of danger. He is surrounded by friends he cannot trust and the law who wants him locked up. Most importantly, we felt it the whole time.Those films were masterworks and even for what 'The Aviator' has its sights set on, as a perfect film it would not reach that grandeur. The film begins as Howard Hughes is painstakingly attempting to complete his war epic 'Hell's Angels.' At the final cost of approaching $4 million it is an irony that the amount is a mere fraction of what the actor playing Hughes normally gets per film! The meat of the picture involves Howard Hughes' relationship with actress Katharine Hepburn, played by Cate Blanchett. At first I feared Blanchett would create a caricature of Hepburn, but the actress is far too gifted for that. The brightest element in this film is, in fact, the quiet moments between the two. As it ends up, Blanchett's performance is the best in the film, eclipsing even DiCaprio's portrayal.That the film is totally about Hughes is made obvious early on. DiCaprio not only has the energy to show the early Hughes filming 'Hell's Angels,' but he also is capable of descending his character into inevitable madness. It is a complex role for DiCaprio and he is clearly up to the task.There are ambitious shots, especially those of Hughes flying his many airplanes. But like 'Gangs of New York,' much of the scenes seem ""stagey"" and enclosed. I wonder if Scorsese should abandon larger scale epics and return to personal stories.Much of the scenery is beautiful and the production team did well to show the different time periods and locations. The cast is a who's who of the neo-Hollywood elite which helps us feel we are among the giants like Hughes must have felt around Hepburn, Errol Flynn and Ava Gardner. Sadly, this is not the same Scorsese. The ambition is glitzy but lacking real substance. To say it is good is fine, but to say Scorsese is now good makes me sad. *** out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Aviator should have gotten ""Best Picture"" Oscar","I am writing to say that ""The Aviator"" should have gotten the Best Picture"" Oscar. The Aviator is a riveting, non-stop emotional picture from beginning to end. It almost seems Howard Hughes is at the helm in producing this picture. It has his intensity, his non-stop energy, his emotional ups and downs, his vibrant colorful life and tragedy. To even compare this fast-paced picture to ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a sacrilege in my opinion. ""Million Dollar Baby"" had my mother asleep and me wanting to get there. The pace is SO>>>>>>slow, the actors only mediocre in my opinion. The script was so simplistic compared to the intriguing lines of the ""Aviator."" I thought Leonardo DeCaprio was par excellence as Howard. He put an incredible piece of himself into a very complicated character and came off very believable in my opinion. Thank you for letting me share my comments.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
never quite delivered,"Twice in a row I have been disappointed by Scorcese. He has managed to get some good work from most of his performer, but he fails to produce enough emotional punch to make this a classic. There are some segments that are quite impressive because of their production values. Unfortunately there is very little soul in the package. De Caprio does some of his best work here, and both Beckinsdale and Hepburn are quite impressive. Still, near the end I wasn't sure what I had seen. It felt long and tedious in some parts. I was hoping it would get better. I never felt the passion and the fire in the man, never got to the point where I could relate to his victory or the joy he took in his work. There are 5 minutes in ""Azkaban"" where I could feel the joy and glory of flying. I felt like I was watching the sketches or the rehearsals here.Maybe next time.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Vivid Portrayal of a Crippled Colossus,"While ""The Aviator"" is Martin Scorsese as a for-hire director, he barrels into it with the same visual zeal for exposing the surface excesses and tragic consequences of unbridled capitalism of 1930's/'40's Hollywood and the aviation industry that he did for the Gilded Age of ""Age of Innocence"" and the Las Vegas of ""Casino.""There is more than a passing resemblance to ""Citizen Kane"" in story arc and style as the outsider millionaire Howard Hughes seizes the popular imagination to take on The Establishment of the media moguls, business competition and the Congress while bedding stars and battling personal demons amidst a loyal coterie. The metaphors come together in a foreboding scene within the klieg lights of a Hollywood premiere as Hughes, with Jean Harlow on his arm in a cameo by Gwen Stefani, is blinded by light bulbs that crash onto a red carpet strewn with broken glass and is too deafened to partake in PR banter.From the opening shots of the making of ""Hell's Angels"" Scorsese ties together the two improbable if it weren't true twin obsessions of Hughes, movies and airplanes, so we also see the source of the director's interest in the project. Scorsese's love of old movies comes through as he really gets into Hughes's upstart movie-making techniques outside the studio system and the ratings board. There's almost too many movie clips (though I've seen interviews where Scorsese's descriptions of the airplane footage in the original ""Hell's Angels"" are more thrilling than what's actually re-created here), but they serve as a haunting backdrop for Hughes's deterioration as he silhouettes against replays of his films like Gloria Swanson in ""Sunset Boulevard.""Leonardo DiCaprio is surprisingly and astoundingly effective as he wouldn't naturally seem to resemble the imposing Hughes. Perhaps that's why Scorsese uses an unusual, for him, number of close-ups which emotionally work as an entrée to Hughes's perceptions, enthusiasms and psychological problems. While DiCaprio is aided by excellent make-up and hair styling as he ages and the character matures and changes, the accent, body language, tortured expressions and seductive intensity are all his. The movie powerfully shows how involved the self-taught Hughes was in the design of his innovative planes and his gutsy piloting. I hope DiCaprio's youth appeal will bring in younger audiences, as the few in the audience I saw it with were clueless about the historical figures and references in the film.I was leery of anyone taking on Katharine Hepburn so I was surprised not only how good Cate Blanchett was but even more surprised by her chemistry with DiCaprio, which I thought originally was as odd a casting pairing, as well, Hughes was with Hepburn. They really make it work, both together and in a fast-talking dinner with her intellectual, politically active Yankee family.Alan Alda is terrific as the corrupt senator, but I was surprised that he had his New York accent rather than adopt a Down East one as he was supposed to be a Maine senator. Even in comparison to the climactic Senate hearings in ""The Godfather,"" this ping pong conflict is exciting, helped by the exaggerated production design and theatrical lighting that reflects how Hughes sees the match up in his shaky mental state. (There's no hearing room in Congress that large or would have photographers that close.)Also in the ensemble Alec Baldwin and John C. Reilly are almost too restrained as, respectively, the Pan Am CEO and Hughes's COO. Ian Holm is delightful in a very small part that helps to show how Hughes kept around him a small group of loyalists who enabled his eccentricities. Jude Law as Erroll Flynn is a cameo and seems to be there only to represent the conventionally dissolute Hollywood as opposed to Hepburn and Hughes being in a parallel trajectory.Kate Beckinsale is just pretty and has none of Ava Gardner's earthy presence nor brazenness. Even though she talks frankly, she is not a tough dame and she just seems to be playing dress-up in the extravagant period costumes.Sandy Powell's period costumes are wonderful, even the men's clothes are eye-catching in how they set off the actors' bodies, yet are stylistically appropriate.The production design is a bit over the top, but it emphasized how outsized Hughes's environment was, as a billionaire controlling a huge airplane factory and airline and as a Hollywood arriviste in the glamorous nightlife. The flying special effects, particularly of the breathtaking Beverly Hills crash, fit the overall tone.The cinematography is ravishing, over a wide variety of settings and environments.As usual for a Scorsese film the period song selections are superb. Stay through the credits to hear a Leadbelly song about Hughes. It's fun to see both Rufus and Loudon Wainwright as nightclub entertainers. Howard Shore's score is a bit overpowering, but does work with the exhilarating aerial shots.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Disregard the bashing,"I have to say I completely disagree with almost everything Yessdanc, for one, felt about this movie; I barely hesitate to say he/she seemed to want to find problems in the performances. I think Leonardo DiCaprio is great in general, but I honestly didn't expect to be as impressed by him (in this film) as the awards voters have been. However, his performance was absolutely fantastic. Howard Hughes was an amazingly complex individual, and DiCaprio made his every eccentric move plausible and real. He studied Hughes well and got amazing depth into his psyche. The accolades are deserved. As for Cate Blanchett seeming like a caricature, maybe -- but only in the sense that Katharine Hepburn herself was kind of like a caricature. Again, the performance was over-the-top only in a way that resembled Hepburn's constantly over-the-top personality. Many actresses would have to cower in shame trying to imitate the late, great Hepburn, but Blanchett did it naturally and without apology. Kudos to her as well. As for the film in general, it's wonderful. At 2 hours and some 40 minutes, it might lag for some, but the material is deep and true, while the acting and directing are heartfelt and energetic. It's a story well told, and it might even get you looking up a little history after the credits.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
So So,"This movie had great potential. The acting was done well enough to convince me. I don't think they missed Howard Hughes' personality by much. What let me down was the reliance on ""Special effects"" to carry so much of the films load. I was under-whelmed by the special effects. On a 27 inch TV screen, they will probably be very convincing, but on the big screen, they were a distraction rather than an enhancement. Like so many modern movies, I think they cut short on story line and put too much focus (no pun intended) on special effects. Katherine Hepburn was easily as irritating as the real Katherine Hepburn, but there was too much of Howard's love life and not enough of his technical achievements. Unless I missed it, there was no mention of him designing what has become the modern hospital bed during his ordeal in the hospital. He was definitely a disturbed individual, but he was also an inventive genius. A more vigorous presentation of the battle between genius and disturbed mind, would have made the film more interesting for me.",,Anonymous,Biography

Interesting but limited,"I enjoyed this movie. And it didn't feel like a three hour film. It moves along quickly, helped by good acting by everyone involved. DiCaprio was particularly good as Howard Hughes. He even aged well.My wife didn't like it as much as I did and I suspect that's because this is a dick-flick (a movie for men!). The movie is at its best when it describes the technical breakthroughs that Hughes pioneered. Even the numerous romances were handled in a fairly brisk. manly fashion.This movie is not a Hughes biography. It covers a small part of his life (the flying bit) and, even then, only part of that (up until 1947). This gives the movie an incomplete feel and leaves you wondering what happened next.But, all in all, it's a good film. Entertaining and well acted.

An utterly fascinating biography,"The Aviator is the second film based on the life of Howard Hughes, after 1977's The Amazing Howard Hughes, starring Tommy Lee Jones, which I haven't seen. However, whereas the first film was based on a book, The Aviator is an original work from screenwriter John Logan, whose previous work, The Last Samurai, I had tremendously enjoyed.Upon watching this film I had no special love or hate for either director Martin Scorsese (I found his Casino to be extremely overrated) or star Leonardo DiCaprio (he was good in Catch Me If You Can, but I hadn't gotten over the over-hype of Titanic).The Aviator is a work of genius. Obviously considered a long film, at nearly 3 hours, it simply zips past, so engrossed you are. Scorsese's direction is brilliant, as is his idea to film each period with that era's ""film color palette"".The performances here are also top-notch, and are delivered from a true all-star cast. Seriously the number of faces you'll recognize (even in tiny roles) is astounding, the Ocean's movies don't come close. But key here is DiCaprio's portrayal of Hughes.Indeed, Leonardo, present in nearly every scene, is the movie's core. And the young actor truly fascinates as he inhabits completely the billionaire genius/madman. It is through him that you see The Aviator, and it is only his actions which interest you. As it should be in biographical film.What else is there to say? Nothing much. There are but a few words to describe The Aviator: fascinating, engrossing, enthralling.. The film has since become a favorite of mine, as has Leonardo DiCaprio.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Expertly Made Biopic,"The Aviator is a flawless and powerful picture that leaves an impact on the viewer. The life of the late Howard Hughes is realized by director Martin Scorsese and his star, Leonardo DiCaprio, in this biopic that shows the millionaire's eccentric ventures into Hollywood film-making and breakthrough feats of aviation by breaking speed records. Before I saw this film, I had never really heard much about Howard Hughes so I wasn't really excited to see this film. However, he turned out to be quite an interesting man and this biopic did a good job of telling his life. He had many dreams and actually worked to try to complete them. He did some bad things and he also nearly died from a plane crash. I had never really had an interest for really old Hollywood but this film made me look up some things. Leonard DiCaprio did a great job portraying Howard Hughes. He would sometimes go over the top but rarely. Cate Blanchett plays Katharine Hepburn and does a pretty good job. I usually don't really like her but this movie is an exception. Kate Beckinsale also did a good job as Ava Gardner. John C. Reilly did a really good job though he wasn't a main character. He is also kind of underrated. Alec Baldwin isn't that great of an actor. I never really liked him but apparently Scorsese has a way to get the best out of everyone. Jude Law and Gwen Stefani aren't in the film very much, in fact I didn't really notice Gwen and Jude has like on scene. So very good acting from everyone. Martin Scorsese directs and I can't believe he didn't win an Oscar for this film. He made a beautiful picture and it was sometimes really moving as well. The running time is a long 168 minutes but it goes by so fast as I was defiantly hooked on the film. I find this film superior to Ray as it was better made. The characters were more interesting, direction was better and it didn't suffer from too many clichés. Jamie Foxx did a better job then Leo but not by much. This film also makes you wonder why Hollywood doesn't make films more like this one. In the end, this is an expertly made film and defiantly worth checking out. Rating 10/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
An unfortunate disappointment.,"There is several related but distinctive ways to present a life history. Here are just five of them:1. Fiction: As in Jack London's autobiographical, ""Martin Eden."" This calls for the engagement of story elements where a protagonist is introduced, conflict results from his or her personality and life choices and the conflict is resolved with the effect of having the character changed.2. Panorama: As in David Lean's unforgettable ""Lawrence of Arabia"" where the subject becomes the pivotal instrument of a historical event and epic magnitude is attained.3. Pageant: As in Richard Attenborough's memorable Gandhi where the subject actually creates history within the presentation of a story and that story once again reaches epic importance.4. Chronicle: As in Sunrise at Campobello, the story Franklin Delano Roosevelt, or The Spirit of St. Louis, on the Charles Lindbergh flight.5. Tabloid: Where a laundry list of yellow press reportage is woven into continuity.Aviator is the last of these. Here is a by-the-numbers presentation of tabloid headline stories fleshed into sometimes interesting dialogue but never revealing the depths of the man except for one odd, unexplored scene from his childhood with his mother. Nor does the film adequately present Hughes' remarkable influence on the history of aviation. Instead it's tossed off in a casual style except for the depiction of some of his dramatic adventures in aviation while his early career in Hollywood is presented as an exaggerated, frenzied comic strip.Another curiosity, not a single one of the selected actors in the film bears the slightest resemblance to the celebrity being played. For example, Jean Harlow is played by an ethnic, Mediterranean type of woman in what looks like a tight, cheap blonde wig instead of the airy, blousy colorless hair which was Lombard's trademark. Cate Blanchett does a fine job at emulating the Kate Hepburn voice but has none of her fine, angular facial features. The worst choice was Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, nowhere close.The physical miscastings are topped by Leonardo DiCaprio who, God bless him, works his little heart out playing Hughes but selling us his Oogie Pringle, Walter Denton teen, nasal soprano voice for Hughes' baritone is challenging. This mismatch is compounded especially for those of us who can still recall the mature, handsome face of Howard Hughes and can contrast it with DiCaprio's still unlined Kewpie appearance.Perhaps the most irritating part of this picture is in its distortion of Howard Hughes' years where we see, for example, his extreme and radical mental deterioration begin before his famous senate hearings of 1947 which was not the case. My own original and primary research with a long time friend who lived in Vegas and knew Hughes in his final years said to me emphatically that he was not the bizarre psycho with long fingernails and matted hair described in the media back then.In summary, the film is devoid of meaning and strangely hollow. It is conversely not without some entertainment value. It has some marvelous performances in it, especially that of Alan Alda as Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. However, as a biopic of Howard Hughes I can't recommend it",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Beautifully Crafted Film!,"I won't deny it. I'm a huge Martin Scorsese fan and have rarely been disappointed with any choices the director has made. The Aviator met my high expectations and in many ways surpassed them. One could not ask for a more gorgeous filmed movie. Every scene is so lush in detail and color, and did I mention detail! If one ever wants to see a true biopic on old Hollywood or even a museum of knowledge about 30's and 40's pop culture, this is it. Besides the eye and sound candy is the acting caliber. The Aviator has one of the best casts this year led by Leonardo Dicaprio and Cate Blanchett. They both give wonderfully rich and absorbing performances and should make the Academy's job extra hard at crunch time. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hits you in the gut,"This film takes the most well-known weirdo in pre-Michael Jackson American history and exposes him as the great hero he actually was. Without turning it into a sickening flag-waving idol portrait... but by making you FEEL it in the gut instead. What a cinematic accomplishment.Leonardo DiCaprio finally escapes the 'hunk yard', and comes out as the fine actor he actually is. Which surprised me the most, until my wife reminded me of ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" True, he is talented far beyond the typecasting he sunk into on top of Titanic's stern, and we can only hope that this will be his springboard into some serious character stuff.Everybody else has rightly praised Cate Blanchett, and all I can do is agree... and Alec Baldwin... and Alan Alda... but most of all, this is Scorsese at his very best.FINAL GRADE: Stop wasting time reading this review, go out and buy the DVD instead.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The actresses,"For someone who has been watching and watching again Katherine Hepburn's and Ava Gardner's movies for years ,this movie does not make it.It's impossible to believe that the two actresses are ""Sylvia Scarlet"" or ""Pandora"" .Howard Hughes's face is much less familiar so Di Caprio ,whose performance is quite good ,is not such a problem.I have nothing against Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale ,but the fact that they do not look their parts gets in the way.Maybe the younger generations does not have the same problem .All that remains is quite satisfying and the male cast ,including Ian Holm ,a suave mischievous Alec Baldwin and William Dafoe whose appearance does not exceed 5 minutes ,is uniformly good.Excellent use of ""the outlaw"" excerpts.",,Anonymous,Biography
Absorbing biography of a troubled aviator,"Even though a lot of viewers were disappointed with this movie, I enjoyed it. It was a thoroughly absorbing biography of a brilliant, but mentally ill, aviator, innovator and filmmaker. The scenes of the Hollywood nightclubs and film sets in the 1920s, 30s and 40s were interesting and vividly recreated that glamorous, excting world. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job of depicting Hughes' charm, brilliance and creepiness. Cate Blanchett was wonderful as Katherine Hepburn, and Kate Beckinsale was good as Ava Gardner. The film isn't perfect. Some more information about Hughes' childhood (i..e, he was an only child, dropped out of high school, took engineering classes at Cal Tech, etc.) would have been helpful. I agree with another reviewer who said that implying that his mother caused his mental illness is unfair and inaccurate. I also agree that some of the scenes dragged on too long, especially the scenes with Katherine Hepburn. That said, it was an absorbing, well-acted and well-directed movie about a fascinating, brilliant and tragic man.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too much Hughes,"Certainly a good and informative film but it lacked dramatic depth and for us didn't generate great emotion. The film so focused on Hughes' ambitions and sad illnesses that the characters with whom he interacted seemed more like part of the scenery than independent characters to care about. (One exception perhaps was Hughes' aviation expert, they did seem to have a real relationship.) Maybe that's a fatal flaw when you set out to cover so much of the productive life of man like this.I also didn't buy the idea that his mother's warnings and washings accounts for what happened to Hughes. Maybe Scorsese wanted to create a Rosebud/Citizen Kane feel, at least that's what popped into my mind. But Hughes' problems went way beyond an anal mother.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

flawed but compelling look at a visionary,"It ain't always easy being a visionary and an innovative genius - just ask Howard Hughes, the renowned millionaire, who had three main ambitions in life: to build the fastest airplanes, to make the biggest movies, and to become the richest man in the world. That he achieved those lofty goals at a very great personal cost to himself is what makes his story the stuff of legend. For Hughes also suffered from the demon of mental illness, which manifested itself in chronic obsessive/compulsive behavior, a neurotic fear of germs, and acute paranoia. Martin Scorsese captures all facets of this larger-than-life figure in ""The Aviator,"" a high-flying epic that does justice to a man who became a national icon and the embodiment of the American dream despite his internal weaknesses - and whose legend lives on today.John Logan's script spends virtually no time on Hughes' youth except for a brief prologue which shows Howard's hypochondriac mother planting those seeds of fear in his tender psyche that would haunt him the rest of his life. The story proper begins with Hughes' efforts to produce what would turn out to be the most expensive film ever made up to that time, the war epic ""Hell's Angels,"" a non-studio work that allowed Hughes to combine his twin loves of movie-making and aviation. If nothing else, Hughes thought BIG, and his capriciousness and profligacy, as reflected in the mounting budget of the film he was making, also spilled over into the realm of aviation, as he began looking for ways to create ever more aerodynamic airplanes at greater and greater cost. His obsession with size culminated in the creation of the ill-fated Spruce Goose, the largest airplane ever made - and one whose airborne career lasted exactly one flight.Logan and Scorcese also focus on the personal side of Hughes' life, concentrating specifically on his tumultuous affairs with Katharine Hepburn (brilliantly played by Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). His relationship with Hepburn is a particularly telling one because they seem to understand one another so well - so well, in fact, that they are unable to make a permanent go of things and wind up going their separate ways.As director, Scorcese brings his usual flair and visual inventiveness to the film, soaring highest - as is appropriate, perhaps - in the aviation sequences. The first hour, in particular, moves at a breathless clip, as he weaves the various strands of his epic - yet, at the same time, intimate - story into a cohesive whole. If the truth be told, at 170 minutes, the movies does run a little too long and it sags a bit in its middle section. However, as Hughes begins to unravel psychologically - at one point locking himself in a screening room barely clinging to what little remains of his sanity - the movie becomes a sad but fascinating study of a man in the throes of a nervous breakdown. The scene in which Hepburn converses with Hughes through a locked door, pleading with him to let her come in and help him, is heartbreaking in its poignancy.As Hughes, Leonardo Di Caprio carries the weight of the film on his frail shoulders, and he does a superb job, hitting new dramatic heights in the scenes in which he both falls to pieces psychologically and rises confidently to the challenge of clearing his good name in a senate hearing. Alan Alda is also terrific as the senator from Maine determined to get Hughes to sell TWA to Pan Am in order to achieve a monopoly on international flight carriers in the future.The first half of the 20th Century provided fertile soil for individuals like Hughes to grow and flourish, men with the brains to see what the future offered and the guts to reach out and go for it. The film captures the era beautifully through the art deco architecture, the dazzling sets and costumes, and a nostalgia-evoking soundtrack overflowing with familiar period standards.What Scorcese undoubtedly understands is that Hughes continues to cast a spell over the general public not because of what he accomplished as a moviemaker, an inventor, an entrepreneur, but because he did all those things battling demons that made him both inexplicably strange and, at the same time, more recognizable as a human being with weaknesses very much like ourselves. It is this paradox that creates the kind of mystery a figure needs if he is to remain a source of fascination long after his death. In honor of that spirit, ""The Aviator"" doesn't unravel the enigma of Howard Hughes; it deepens it. And that is as it should be.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A puzzling and enigmatic personality,"Legends about Howard Hughes are numerous about his final days, when he cocooned himself in a hotel in Las Vegas, but this film offers some astonishing insights about the reclusive billionaire even for those familiar with his legacies.Hughes was a colorful and interesting man, a tireless workaholic successful in almost everything he did. Even when a project failed, he'd bounce right back, never giving up at any time. As the Aviator, he actually held a speed record for a flight at one time. He was a film producer. He was popular with women. He founded an airline. He owned casinos in Vegas. And on and on. Although Leonardo DiCaprio' performance captured this unique and enigmatic man's puzzling personality well, he doesn't resemble him enough. This may detract from the movie for some viewers, others may overlook it since DiCaprio's work was so strong.It's a powerful story which is depicted well. Special effects of a plane crash he miraculously survives are executed with uncompromising intensity. The rise of the entrepreneur is depicted well; the ferocious and unwavering spirit of Hughes is clearly defined, as is his ultimate descent into a paranoid reclusiveness. The scene with the milk bottles will leave you shuddering as you consider the tragic degeneration of a man of his stature. The film is not exploitive in this, but sympathetically offers insights into this man's psychological state.The movie achieves all that it sets out to do, and will leave you thinking afterwards.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Entertainment,"The Aviator is a completely enthralling experience as a movie that excellently connects and communicates the ""BIG"" characteristics of its subject matter -- Howard Hughes, the Hell's Angels production, Hollywood, the emergence of aviation and the power of its technology, government, America's new obsession with stars, big business, and the destructive power of mental illness. Leonardo DiCaprio, who for years seems to have been searching for and consistently missing opportunities in which his talents are suited, is so fitting in this role. He knows ""BIG"", as a superstar following the Titanic craze, and as such is prepared for the burden required to play Howard Hughes in his heyday. The film is remarkably filmed, with such attention to details that work together to convey the ""BIG-ness"" of the story -- even down to the energetic performances of the singers in the lounge Hughes frequents. The musical score is a terrific partner in this effort as well. Alan Alda, now far enough away from his M.A.S.H. days, is believable in his role as the dirty Senator. Kate Blanchette, while off to a rough start as Katherine Hepburn (has an initial vibe of a caricature), finds her pace as the movie progresses and is able to deliver the duties of presenting Miss Hepburn as the last normal thing in Mr. Hughes' life. There is tremendous fun and excitement in this movie, but it never tumbles into the traps of over-doing it or cheesiness. Scorsese has crafted a wonderful cinematic experience, for those interested in a smart biographical portrayal.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sorsese and DiCaprio deliver great work here,"The Aviator is another dynamic film from Martin Scorsese. He has employed his energetic style to the story of the Hollywood mogul / aviation pioneer Howard Hughes, the result is a fast-paced and entertaining biopic. It's a more restrained effort than Scorsese usually delivers and it's pretty obvious that it was going very much for a PG-13 rating given the very blatant method of including one f-bomb to affect this. So the material, while still showing the darker aspects of the title character, nevertheless whitewashes him considerably too – in real life he seemed to be anti-Semitic and racist, while he also killed someone due to dangerous driving (neither of these two aspects made it into this film). What we do see is still a man with many flaws though with his recklessness, excessive perfectionism, womanising and germ phobia. Leonardo DiCaprio really is excellent in the part it has to be said and shows again just what a skilled actor he really is.Unusually for a biopic the story begins with Hughes already a millionaire and in the middle of making the World War I fighter-plane epic Hell's Angels. We see the money he threw at this picture and his perfectionist attitude leading to it being a very elongated shoot. Despite the film's huge success, he was never fully accepted by the Hollywood old boy's network and was considered an outsider. It's this aspect that has been used to make a hero of Hughes in this film, a man against the system if you will; even though I am sure the truth was less clear-cut given his massive wealth and more unsavoury character traits. Whatever the case, we see him push the boundaries of acceptability in movies with his violent crime film Scarface (1932) and his racy feature film The Outlaw (1943), we see him design ever more ambitious planes, we hear of him circumnavigating the world, and testing aircraft himself (this includes an expertly filmed sequence where Hughes crashes one of his planes into the middle of a populated area), we witness him founding his own airline TWA and in the process gain powerful business and political enemies which leads to a congressional investigation and finally we see a man suffering from paranoia who becomes a mentally ill recluse.The story of Hughes life certainly was a dramatic one and Scorsese presents it as such. He even had romances with Katharine Hepburn (played brilliantly by Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), which adds a glamorous social life to his high profile public achievements. The lush period detail adds a great deal to proceedings with a beautiful look maintained throughout. Scorsese even went so far as to use an old two-strip Technicolor process for the cinematography which leads to the strange moments where we see fields and golf courses replete with blue grass. So, all-in-all, this amounts to another typically well executed, handsome-looking and energetic effort from Scorsese and his first genuinely great collaboration with DiCaprio.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Spectacular Effects, Beautiful Sets, Fine Acting, Yet Lacks Heart","The Aviator,helmed by legendary Martin Scorsese, had so much going for it: spectacular visual effects, wonderful costuming and set design, and extraordinary acting from Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett. And you would think that a film that has all the elements OF a great film would also have something that The Aviator unfortunately lacks: heart.The film opens with Howard Hughes as a child, his mother bathing him and telling him how dangerous the world is. It then cuts to Howard Hughes in his twenties, on the set of Hell's Angels where it is immediately apparent just how powerful this young playboy's drive is. He wants absolute perfection at his craft, which is making a realistic and believable film about war and combat, which he succeeds at. His peers do not take hi seriously, however, because of his age and his somewhat childish look on things. Howard Hughes begins the film young and powerful, an by the end, has aged and started to let his infatuation for cleanliness and germs to wither him away to just an obsessive compulsive loner who locks himself in his office for months at a time.Leonardo DiCaprio has never been a more finer actor, taking his boyish features and completely transforming himself into Howard Hughes. Every gesture, the accent, his compulsiveness, it is amazing just how wonderful Leonardo has evolved from the pretty faced boy in Titanic to serious Hollywood actor in The Aviator. Not to mention, the chemistry he and Cate Blanchett had on screen jelled, bringing Hepburn's strong will and Hughes's dependence on that to function.Cat Blanchett was, not to say the least, amazing at recreating a legendary Hollywood icon, playing the part of Kathrine Hepburn to a tee. It was quite apparent that a lot of research by Blanchett was done to perfect all of Hepburn's little mannerisms, and larger than life character. Blanchett is in much need of an Oscar for her portrayal in the film, for it is nothing short of amazing.The sets and costumes were extraordinary, to watch The Aviator is a trip down memory lane for older generations and an eye opening educational venture for the younger generations. The Hollywood premieres that were recreated, the legendary actresses such as Ava Gardner, it gives a sense of longing for the golden years of Hollywood before everything became so commercialized. There are spectacular camera shots throughout the film such as the flight of the Spruce Goose, the filming of the air battles in Hell's Angels, and the spectacular plane crash in Beverly Hills. All these make for one adventurous film.Yet, with all these elements going for it, The Aviator really lacks heart. Though the first half of the film, Howard Hughes is at the top of his game, and the audience is entertained, yet kept far away enough where they will not really care that Hughes is slowly letting his OCD take over his life. At a nearly three hour run time, by the end of the film when Hughes's has finally completed his decent into madness you may be fidgeting and squirming from boredom. Martin Scorsese put together the life of Howard Hughes, yet kept him emotionally far way enough from the audience that they are more an observer of Hughes than actually caring for him. And that was the biggest problem of the film. Great films have characters you deeply care for, and that is all that prevents The Aviator from being that: Greatness.Come Oscar night, there is no doubt that The Aviator will walk away with some awards, that is a given. The Aviator is recommended for it's stunning recreation of old Hollywood, the pioneering of aviation, and the incredible acting by DiCaprio and Blanchett. Unfortunately, by the end, you may be fidgeting, waiting for the film to finally end.Recommended.MJR",,Anonymous,Biography
gorgeous technically superior,"Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) uses his Texas oil money to satisfy his obsession of making a realistic air war movie ""Hell's Angels"". He becomes romantically involved with actress Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett). He has obsessive-compulsive disorder and is severely afraid of disease stemming from his mother.

His romance with Hepburn comes to end and he starts a new one with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale).Martin Scorsese has given a technically superior movie. It is gorgeous like our imagination of what old Hollywood must have been. Hepburn is doing an impression. DiCaprio is a star. While the movie do a great recreation, it keeps its distance.

A beautifully yet accurately crafted biography of a once tycoon,"A beautifully yet accurately crafted biography of a once tycoon
It is hard to believe that only after 17 years from its debut that I got the chance to watch this famous movie. The IMDb high rating is not wasted after I watched this show. Be it plot, scenes, costume or cast this film is a sensation.The plot catches my eye although I was born after Howard Hughes died. Thanks to this revealing biographical movie I finally get to know an epoch making legend like this. It is hard to imagine that a business tycoon with oil drilling background had such diverse interests in other areas like film making and aviation. He was indeed a talent who not only lived his life by ration but probably more by passion. Live your life to the fullest. Isn't that what we say every day and hadn't this been vividly realized by Hughes?This movie also has captured many other important life details of Hughes. The fanfare he received, the romance he encountered and the planes he designed concertedly give a fuller picture of his personal as well as professional life, many of which have been artistically portrayed by the talented crew. Many scenes are liked by me. The mirthful party scenes, the fine dining scenes and the high flying scenes are all something I enjoy watching as a finer person. Needless to say the costume is an absolute hit, which isn't hard to explain why it achieved the Best Achievement in Costume Design in the Academy Awards.And just to be consistent with my other reviews I must remark on the cast. It would be hard and almost inconceivable for this movie to win multiple Oscar rewards together with many other accolades without the double shot - Hollywood A listers like Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett. The simple truth is - great movies accomplish great actors and great actors achieve great movies. In particular this movie has convinced me of my DiCaprio's superb acting skills. Yes he has made many other great movies such as Titanic (1997), Catch Me If You Can (2002), Gangs of New York (2002) and perhaps equally important Inception (2010) just to name a few. But I am particularly impressed with his acting in this film which is something I can't explain. Maybe I love this story too much. Cate Blanchett, as we all know, has achieved many awards too.Altogether from start to finish, plot to scene, and cast to crew The Aviator (2004) is a must see which you will regret not seeing once you see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Visually stunning; but Martin's best work and best picture? No.,"See, at the Oscars, despite the fact that I had not seen ""The Aviator"", I was cheering for it. Because I am a huge Martin Scorsesse fan and I only saw two other movies that were nominated. Leonardo without a doubt has become a very fine actor, and the clip they showed for his nomination of ""Best Actor"" looked extremely interesting. So, when it came to best picture I was all for ""The Aviator"" or ""Finding Neverland"", but then ""Million Dollar Baby"" took it and I was upset. Still, I had to see ""The Aviator"".While the movie has a very stunning atmosphere and fine actors that can steal the scene, it's not a very interesting story. Howard Hughs, no, I do not know that much about him. In fact, I didn't realize what he really did until I saw this movie. But he just seemed like any ordinary a-hole in life. The movie could have been something spectacular, but the person and story just didn't interest me. So, I'm so sorry Martin, you were not handed anything that could have been gold. This was the problem, because it was too long and the main character wasn't that interesting, you loose track of the film.Otherwise, this is a good all around film to watch for a Saturday. Is it a watch? Oh, yes. 2 hours and 45 minutes of Leo is a little much to handle. But I would recommend it to see good flick, but that's all it is.

Scorsese lost it,"I am a genuine lover of films. I write this not to be hateful but to give my honest opinion about a film that is getting hyped by critics but that left me and my friends baffled. Quite frankly, I can't remember a film I despised so much as THE AVIATOR, a beautifully photographed leaden piece of metal with no more heart than a piece of left over scrap metal from the Spruce Goose. Howard Hughes is an admittedly difficult subject matter for a film (perhaps this is why so many announced film projects about the eccentric billionaire have gone by the way side) -- Peculiar to a fault, Scorsese fails to make Hughes sympathetic or understandable to audiences he expect to go on a three hour journey into Hughes madness (which is pretty much the same in the third scene in the film as it is in the last.) DiCaprio does his best, but the character of Hughes has nowhere to go. So he's rich and eccentric and troubled. Why should we care if we can't sympathize or at least empathize? And we are really excepted to believe his life long phobias are the result of a single conversation with his creepy mother during a bath?The lone bright spot in this film is Cate Blanchett who manages to turn in a richly textured performance of Katherine Hepburn. But her presence ain't worth the boredom you have to wade through the other 2 hours and 45 minutes she's not on film. This is a film critics seem to love, and I'm no critic. But I know when a film leaves me bolting for the exit at the end.If the site of naked, half mad Howard Hughes lining up rows upon rows of milk bottles filled with urine is your idea of a good time, THE AVIATOR is the film for you.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Remarkable Story For A Remarkable Man!,"In The Aviator, star Leonardo Dicaprio delves deeper into the psyche of his character than he has for any performance previous. Not since his breakthrough performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape has DiCaprio fallen in so believably into his role. Beyond his uncanny resemblance to the reclusive Howard Hughes, DiCaprio's emotional output in the role is emotionally stunning. His performance eclipses all others in the film, despite his co-stars' not insubstantial contributions to their characters.The Aviator is a movie that simply succeeds on multiple creative levels. It is also an emotionally gripping biography and a beautiful film in both technical achievement and performance.

A Long Flight,"Overlong but generally engaging biography of the legendary Howard Hughes. DiCaprio is quite believable as the high-flying millionaire. Blanchett is also convincing as Katherine Hepburn. An all-star cast fills out the rest of the cast. This one could have used a good editor as Scorcese decides to give us a complete portrait of Hughes, warts and all, as in nearly three hours of ALL. The scenes of Hughes' withdrawal into a darkened room drag on way too long. The film is at its best in the early parts as Hughes starts his Hollywood career. There is a hilarious scene where Hughes has Prof. Fritz (Holm) explain to the censor's board why Jane Russell's breasts are not obscene.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Crazy about flight,"What's the point of a biopic, anyway? Is it meant to be a sort of crude cloning, like a waxworks effigy at Madame Tussaud's but with moving images? Or is it meant to delve into the secrets, show us the real man or woman behind the public mask? In the case of Howard Hughes, we already know all about the weirdness. What Martin Scorsese means to do is to show that Hughes was also a heroic figure in the history of aviation, and a playboy who had a great deal of fun. That may be a bit of a stretch: Hughes's story is full of epic foul-ups, spectacular wastes of money and time and lives to satisfy his mistaken whims, not to mention morally dubious actions; but nonetheless Scorsese's new movie, which focuses on Hughes's early, triumphant decades, is fun to watch. It soars and sparkles This is where Leonardo DiCaprio comes in. Did Scorsese just choose DiCaprio to get a big budget for his aviation epic? I don't think so. There's more logic in it than that. Yes, Leo is too young-looking and reedy-voiced, but the movie in many if not all respects works anyway, and so does DiCaprio's performance. It's fun seeing the fine clothes and high life. DiCaprio looks great all duded up: his face and body fit quite well with 20-'s-30's-40's styles, and he's equally believable as party boy and ladies' man.Scorsese's version of Katherine Hepburn -- who turns out to be one of the linchpins of the movie -- isn't too far off. At least her story gibes with the way the actress herself tells it in her memoir, About Me, which explains how her ex-husband's presence and her family's snobbish, clubby ways put Hughes off, how she discovered he was hard of hearing but tried to hide it, how they were too much alike to stay paired off for more than a couple of years. Cate Blanchett as Hepburn however not only doesn't look at all like her (she isn't as sharp and stylish), any more than Leo looks like Hughes; despite her obvious mimicry of the voice, she also doesn't really deliver her lines with the clarity, the rhythm, and the panache that Hepburn unfailingly had. But hers is essential as the liveliest female presence and so very much needed in this macho story about a boy and his toys.The Aviator isn't too long if you accept that it's an epic. But can you do that? It's a colorful and unique story, but beyond that it doesn't quite know what it is, a clinical case history, a piece of hero-worship, an epic, a tragedy, or a comedy, and so it self-destructs, almost, toward the end, when the fun ends and the craziness increasingly begins to take over. We can certainly be glad it wasn't cast in the form of a solemn tragedy. It could have been made a comedy throughout. Hughes's obsessive-compulsive/paranoid meltdowns are tragi-comic.The aviation sequences are so amazing you wonder how they did them. One simple answer is, by spending lots of money. They must have cost as much as Hughes's extravagant projects. Again, this aspect of the movie is a bit of a whitewash, because DiCaprio makes crashing planes look heroic rather than foolhardy.People have commented on the ""clever"" (actually too obvious) way breasts and clouds are connected, and how Hughes's fondling of a woman segues into his feeling of a new plane's shell for perfectly flush rivets. What's clever is how DiCaprio's face as he ""flies"" is both rapt and manic. Aviation comes to life as a higher calling, perhaps one of the great ones of the twentieth century, but technological progress as a kind of madness, a Luddite's ""I told you so."" Leonardo is not so good as a crazy man. Growing a beard only makes his face look younger. We can believe him as a wild spender. It's harder to believe him as a recluse. (He's more often seen walking around buck naked than cowering in a corner.) But whatever you say, this movie's fun. At least it is till the craziness takes over. And even then it's fun, because Hughes is seen rallying from his longest crazy spell to triumph before the Congressional committee, stomping out to general applause. And DiCaprio works because he has the power to dominate the scene. What is best about DiCaprio is his exuberance -- always -- and his boldness, and those are the aspects of Howard Hughes Scorsese is playing with.All the way through Leo does that wrinkled-brow charming-eyes look Orson Welles used to do, and you think of Citizen Kane. The Aviator may not be Scorsese's Citizen Kane but it's a fascinating movie and much more successful than the ill starred and lugubrious Gangs of New York. There are numerous splendid spectacles in The Aviator and they all have a glitzy glamour about them and are perfect for the wide screen in a big Cineplex. But is this what made the Scorsese of Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas great? No. He's been seduced, not by money, but by movie grandeur, and he's moved far away from his boorish New York roots. In that he somewhat resembles Zhang Yimou, who's also moved toward pure spectacle, and with even better results -- not, of course, doing the biography of a modern figure.The question remains: why do directors do biopics? Is Scorsese really looking for himself in the mad failed movie director, the obsessive compulsive recluse, as Oliver Stone is said to see himself in the megalomaniac Alexander obsessed by his mother?

"""There too much Howard Hughes in Howard Hughes""","And thus with the most simplistic of statements Katherine Hepburn, an Oscar rewarded though arguably over-cooked Blanchet, illustrates the inner turmoil of the films protagonist, a man whose ambition and imagination are only surpassed by his inner struggles and mental instability.In a melancholy scene involving Hughes's mother planting the seeds of obsession in her son, Scorsese, from the get go set the tone for the emotional roller-coaster and ultimately tragedy that was the life of Howard Hughes. A story such as Hughes would lend itself greatly to melodrama, but Scorsese brilliance shines through in his ability to deal with characters as they were, real. Through the film Hughes, portrayed admirably by DiCaprio, displays characteristics of both madman and genius. In the latter half his inner conflicts influence greatly his actions, which at times seem sadistic and crazy, yet we are gently reminded that behind the rumour and myth that grew over the years, lies a human being, as vulnerable and futile as the rest of us. Within the first half of the focus is mainly on that of the lesser known ""young Howard"" whose daredevil, heart throb antics seem a million miles away from the 'insane old man of Vegas.' And with this sets one of the main themes of the movie the price and pressure of fame on those inept to cope with it, one which I'm sure has personal affiliations for the director.Hughes as a character is dynamic, resourceful and intelligent, demonstrated early in the successful competition of the over budget and overly ambitious Hells Angels. It appear that Howard's devotion in life divides, albeit unequally, into his three passions; film-making, aviation and woman. Never able to maintain a perfect balance his obsession with the production of 'the Hercules' causes him to loose the seemingly most important person in his life, Hepburn. And yet although most of his wounds are self-inflicted Scorsese touch is so compassionate that one cannot help but draw both sorrow and inspiration from the story. Although ultimately sub-due, the films tone cannot be said to be entirely depressing. In fact one of the most appealing qualities of Howard's character is his adversity in the face of defeat. He breaks several world records, overcomes the conniving Wuan Tripp and sustains his fortunes against all odds.If nothing else The Aviator is great story of one of Americas greatest fallen hero's, who outlived his legend. Expect the usual master class in directing from Scorsese whose passion for the subject is conveyed on screen. The acting is also adequately executed, and for once DiCaprio I think lives up to his hype, it also must be mentioned that Ian Holm steals every scene he's in.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Howard Hughes, The Aviator""","""The Aviator"" focuses on the brilliant and tragic life of the fascinating madman and genius, Howard Hughes, 1905-1976, (to be precise, 20 years of it, from 1927 when 22 years old Hughes was producing the film ""Hell's Angels"" until 1947 when his most famous aircraft, the Hercules was completed). The film is as amazing and dark as the man who called himself with pride, ""Howard Hughes, the Aviator"". Cinematography, Art Direction, and Editing were perfect in the almost 3 hours long film that never for a moment seemed too long or boring. Martin Scorsese made a spectacular and dynamic picture and Leonardo DiCaprio earns my respect and admiration for his acting - he is one of the most talented young actors now and I will be waiting for his following films impatiently. I trusted him in every scene and he made me feel strongly for and sympathize with Howard Hughes's affliction.Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin both gave great performances as the corrupted and disgusting Senator Brewster (Alda) and truly memorable Pan-American Airways CEO Juan Trippe, Hughes' enemy and competitor (Baldwin played a delightful villain). Surprisingly for myself, I didn't like very much Cate Blanchett's impersonation of Katherine Hepburn (I usually love Blanchette in every movie I've seen her)  it seemed more like caricature but it is a matter of personal liking or not.I feel that ""The Aviator"" took off the ground like a huge steel bird and took me with it to the marvelous journey. I also believe that ""The Aviator"" is much better and more interesting film than the last year's Oscar winner - but again, this is my opinion. You, of course are entitled to have yours which may be completely different from mine.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A different look at Howard Hughes,"Leonardo Dicaprio loses himself entirely in another role, this one the real life portrayal of Howard Hughes. I didn't know a lot about the real man, but this paints a darker picture of his struggles and paranoia. It's a little slow at times but the cinematography and lush colors are gorgeous and Leo is great.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Reflexive,"Those of us familiar with Scorsese's long career know what we're seeing - the ideal vehicle (Hughes' story) for him to reflect on and direct commentary right back at himself.Scorsese spent much of his early years pushing against similar 'Code' restrictions on sex and violence in film. He put manic energy into everything he did, and survived addiction (paralleled in this movie as the womanizing and obsessive-compulsions). He later battled skeptics and naysayers who questioned his budgets.But what makes this worth watching as a movie is the completion of his paradigm shift from character excess and character fixation to the ability to capture a world and move about it as he wills. ""Gangs..."" hinted at this, but tripped over its detail-consciousness. Here the camera is free to explore; we get narrative -flow-. There are virtually no face close-ups; the emphasis is always on the surrounding space.And DiCaprio acquits himself mightily here. Compare this to a container built by a mechanistic hack (Cameron's ""Titanic"") and it's a joking matter. The key is he plays a man who drives the world he occupies, and never overpowers it.Worth the near three-hour investment...",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Soaring yet falling,"The Aviator is, yet another, Scorsese masterpiece that deals with the life and glory of a character I would've never seen myself liking so much. The story is focused on Howard Hughes, a character who, undoubtedly, is foreign to many people in the present. Hughes inherited his parents' fortune at twenty-two, directed the most expensive movie at the time, spent money worse than a drunken sailor, and was building planes that were set to be used by the Army Air Forces. Enigmatic, yes. But far from a feasible hero.Hughes is played effortlessly by Leonardo DiCaprio. He has already established that he'll take any role, from J. Edgar to a man on a doomed ship, and he has been on a continuing streak of fantastic films. We can pretend Romeo and Juliet never existed. Here, he accepts the challenge to focus on the glory years of Hughes (1927 to around the early forties), where he was living the dream, then quickly becoming his own worst enemy. DiCaprio's challenge is also presented when he must transition Hughes delicately from a fully functioning, money-hungry womanizer to a slowly, defeatist madmen without overacting or hammering home on the clichés. The result is beyond commendable.Hughes, himself, was a man that possessed energy, efficiency, courage, and determination in limitless amounts. He had the ability to pick up any woman he wanted, say anything he wanted, and casually ask a woman to marry him like one would say ""pass the salt."" Not only was he a professional ladies man, he was a surreal filmmaker, directing a film called Hell's Angles at twenty-two. After two years of unprecedented hell trying to get the film shot efficiently, right down to cloud formations, he casually tells his business executive, Noah Dietrich (Reily) that he'd like to reshoot it, this time, occupying sound to please a demanding audience. Was he completely unaware of the time and money he put into the silent version, or just a reckless spender of money? Going back to his womanizing ways, one woman Hughes put through hell and high-water was Katharine Hepburn (Blanchett). She had to put up with his increasing OCD habits, not to mention once his name became big because of Hell's Angles, all the starlets that would inevitably follow. She left him soon after, much to his dismay.What did Hughes do maybe achieve closure or ease the pain? Become involved with more women. One of them was fifteen year old Faith Domergue (Garner) and another being the amazingly beautiful Ava Gardner (Beckinsale).After his work behind the camera, Hughes put films in the foreground, as he wanted to focus on something bigger; aircrafts. He loved them more than life itself. He had a monstrous idea; to build a blame that could float on water and soar higher than plausible. He would name it ""Hercules,"" a name of piercing accuracy.The art direction is extraordinary. One of the most thrilling scenes involves something Scorsese rarely uses, but when it is applied, he always uses effectively; special effects. The scene involves Hughes crash-landing in Beverly Hills with the wing of the plane slicing the rooftops of houses like a table saw cutting through a tin can. This scene is fantastic because it doesn't focus on the awesomeness of it all, but it the peril and the exhilaration Hughes must have felt while in the plane. His struggle to get out is absolutely haunting and impossible to ignore.Apparently, Scorsese mimicked the bipack color scheme used in films back in the day. This adds sort of a lighter, ""easy on the eyes"" kind of tonality that I have not experienced in films in a long time. Green objects appear to be blue, and some of the later scenes are shots using three strip Technicolor. Not only does Scorsese utilize old technology to tell a timeless story, he presents it the way it would've been told back then. Colorized stock footage mainly makes up the aerial battles, which are wonderfully coherent and intense as can possibly be.Another thing to pay close attention to are the planes. They are scale models, rather than computer creations. This, again, adds to the ""easy on the eyes"" tonality. Everything is natural and looks ravishing, better than anything that could've been created from a software program. It only provides to the already extremely genuine picture we are watching.Howard Hughes was determined, enigmatic, energetic, courageous, yet a sad figure overall. A man consumed by his fear and his uncontrollable OCD. The later scenes of his life, which I dare not spoil, are so devastating and upsetting they are sometimes hard to watch. Here's a man that had it all, then plummeted into a dark, endless hole of murkiness never to be mentioned again until his tragic death in 1976. Rather than plod along through the most likely noneventful teen years leading up to the production of Hell's Angles, The Aviator chooses to reestablish the glory days of Hughes. The film omits the darker days of Hughes life, such as the sixties and the seventies. What we're supposed to feel at the end is unclear, but one thing is for sure, if we walked out sad, it would be extremely out of place.Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Reilly, Gwen Stefani, and Jude Law. Directed by: Martin Scorsese.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Amateurish, fictional account of part of Howard Hughes life","This film was apparently made to appeal to the lowest common denominator. The most noticeable fault is that much of it is untrue. The movie takes place mostly in the 1940's when Hughes was at the peak of his career. There is very little about his life after that period.Although much of his private life was personal and not known to the public, this did not stop the film makers from inventing things they didn't know about him. Although there is no reason to think there was anything psychologically wrong with him at that time, the movie makers made him appear as some kind of nut who mumbled to himself and behaved in crazy ways, something that is unsubstantiated and offensive since he was the head of large corporations and did (his company still does) a lot of business with the government, unlikely for a crazy person as he is depicted in this film.The producers (which include Leonard DiCaprio) apparently took what few bits and pieces of his personal life are known to the public, rearranged them to suit this mostly fictional film, and came up with another trashy Hollywood film.The acting left much to be desired as well.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hell's Angel,"Hell's AngelThe Aviator Dir- Martin Scorsese Cast- Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin Written by- John Logan Rating- ****Howard Hughes was in many ways similar to Charles Foster Kane, the enigmatic and imposing central character of Orson Welles's legendary masterpiece 'Citizen Kane'. The fact that Kane was modelled on media-mogul William Randolph Hearst is not relevant to this review. Like Kane, Howard inherited a large sum of money and found himself at a very young age, equally the richest and the loneliest man in the world. Both were visionaries who always dreamt big. Hughes even had a fascination for large breasts! Both set out after pursuits that seemed stupid and reckless to everybody but themselves. And they both always succeeded. Both amassed large fortunes and attracted media attention. And sadly, both of them didn't know when to stop! While Kane ended up as a lonely millionaire, Hughes suffered from a more terrifying descent into madness.In Martin Scorsese's 'The Aviator', we are not made privy to Howard Hughes's disturbing later life. In that sense it is a rather shallow biopic. But when viewed as a movie, it is as complete as complete can get. 'The Aviator' doesn't try to delve into the life of it's lead character but rather concentrates on one chapter in his life, a ploy employed by the recent 'Finding Neverland'. But unlike 'Finding Neverland', 'The Aviator' doesn't take cinematic liberty and tamper with the facts. John Logan's screenplay introduces us to a young Howard Hughes(Leonardo DiCaprio) working on his ambitious 'Hell's Angels' which took over three years and three million dollars to make. A rank outsider, he is ridiculed by the reigning tycoons for using twenty-six cameras to perfect a shot. Hughes completes the film, then reworks it with sound, before eventually releasing it to universal acclaim. Hughes goes on a roller-coaster of popularity, popping flash bulbs, acquisition deals with TWA and talked about high-profile romances with famous leading ladies. The most significant of his dalliances is with Katharine Hepburn(Cate Blanchett). Not only do we sense a real admiration and possible love between the two, but this interlude is also the most enjoyable portion of the movie. Hughes's visit to Hepburn's family estate in Connecticut establishes as the best scene overall. The Hepburn-Hughes relationship doesn't work probably because they were too similar to each other, both equally headstrong individuals.Concomitantly, obsessive compulsive disorder(OCD) begins to cast its shadow on Hughes. We witness this rich man rendered helpless in a public washroom as he awaits someone to enter so that he can leave without having to touch the doorknob which he fears is not germ-free! His bouts worsen as he begins to repeat words uncontrollably and quarantines himself in a room where he walks around naked, mumbling, and pisses into empty milk bottles. But Hughes manages to curb his eccentricities and restores himself for a congressional hearing which will determine the future of his aviation company(his mammoth plane Hercules especially) against Juan Trippe(Alec Baldwin) and his Pan-Am airways. Hughes fights it out with the wily Senator Brewster(Alan Alda) and defeats him in a battle of wits. Hughes successfully flies his Hercules, but we see his OCD still looming upon him. Scorsese and Logan refuse to take us any further. We don't get to see Hughes succumbing to his madness and dying in a hotel room, at the age of 71, with his hair grown and nails unclipped!Leonardo DiCaprio is not an obvious choice to play Howard Hughes, but he essays his part brilliantly. His struggle to hide his imperfections and keep them in check is very convincing. Cate Blanchett's performance as Hepburn is one that you can't describe in words. She is simply put- amazing, and truly deserving of an Oscar. Another person deserving the statuette is Robert Richardson. His cinematography elevates the movie from a simple biopic to an intriguing character study.Puritans might argue that by removing the darker facet of Hughes's life, Scorsese has tried to sanitize a fallen figure. Rather, Scorsese doesn't make any excuses for the way Howard is. Scorsese never apologized for his characters, be it 'Raging Bull' or 'Taxi Driver'. The denouement of this movie somewhat lends it a haunting feel. As Trippe says of Hughes in the movie, ""People should remember him as he was"". And Hughes was ultimately a visionary, a creator and an aviator!Abhishek BandekarNote- 'The Aviator' is nominated in 11 categories at this year's Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor(Leonardo DiCaprio), Best Actor in a Supporting Role(Alan Alda) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role(Cate Blanchett).Rating- ***** Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent18th February, 2005",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The best American film since Citizen Kane,"A rare uniformity of talent and intelligence was brought to this project. John Logan's script is based on primary source research and reveals Hughes' character in a sequence of carefully deployed scenes that embody this in the context of the national hysteria (mania), which characterized the US from the end of of the 14-18 war through WW11. His seeming debilitating neuroses find a perfect psychiatric logic in that he sees the outer world as something which may come between him and his dream..a very rational view. The timing of his psychic crises always came as his dreams were most in peril and served the purpose of isolating him, protecting him from negative forces. His bacteriaphobia was symbolic and useful.Leonardo Dicaprio (whose project this originally was) is astounding in his vision of Hughes and his realization of it. Again, Logan has provided the right words in the right place to carry this through. Cate Blanchett's Hepburn further confirms this actress's brilliance. She knows that an accent, a pattern of speech, are part and parcel of character and she portrayed this with an intelligent vibrancy seldom seen on the screen today. The supporting cast was uniformly excellent.Scorsese had now made a great American film, his subject a very difficult one, but he shows the greatness of Howard Hughes, his flaws and debilities intertwined with his astounding abilities and imaginatively demonstrates them as inseparable and dynamically necessary.The cinematography is the capstone of this achievement, just as it was in Welles' Citizen Kane. Combined with the editing, this is a visual as well as a textual masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"great movie with an ""updated"" period feel","Martin Scorsese is undoubtedly one of the great living masters of motion pictures.The Aviator succeeds as a motion picture, not so much as a drama. I think this has to do with the changing of times. Persons looked, spoke and behaved totally different some 70 years ago. The actors all generally look too sweet, too gorgeous for the roles of real-life actors they portray (that is: when compared 1:1 with the originals).When we look at the original actors on old movies or newsreels, they were much edgier, much louder and in a way even cruder. People in general clearly have become sweeter looking and more soft spoken. Even the most brilliant casting would not be able to produce a closer resemblance - and I cannot think of a better cast.Of course Cate Blanchett stands out for her Kate Hapburn portrayal not only concerning the voice and behavior but also the hard part: beneath that skinny, bright, talented, tomboyish upper class chatterbox there was a gorgeous and lovable woman who does care. Remarkable (both the original Kate and Cate (destiny?) Blanchett !On a technical level the movie fully succeeds. The computer generated effects fit seamlessly into the live action. The carefully controlled colors and film grain are an eyeful to behold. There is a lot of testosterone in this movie as well. Pure male pioneer spirit. The aircraft all look breathtaking - of course men can better understand why one would drool over the deafening sound of an old radial engine and why someone's heart would pound faster just by looking at all these classic precision crafted Mitchell movie cameras (I am still drooling). This definitely is a movie about (and for) boys and their toys.I found it more than adequate that no attempt was made to ""explain"" Howard Hughes obsessive compulsive behavior. We are just presented with the drama of that mental disorder. Any ""explanation"" (I am still not over the ending of Hitchckock's Psycho) would have taken away from the mystery of the man.The same goes for Huges' totally insane business decisions with his loyal personal employees doing the best to hold everything together. We don't know if Huges' was acting on instinct, impulse, knowledge, relying on luck, had a vision or something else. That's the whole point: no one knew. It is a surprise how articulate he appears opposite Alan Alda (brilliant as usual) during the public hearings.Leo di Caprio gives a great portrait. Of course he looks more boyish and more handsome than the real Hughes, but we are living in the 2000s and our minds interpret persons in a different way now. In a way this movie updates the characters for the actual times we live in.The women in this movie all look drop-dead gorgeous, not like their real life counterparts but most likely very much as they appeared to someone some 70 years ago.One small observation: great English stage actor Ian Holm, still best remembered as Ash the robot from Ridlety Scott's Alien, is once again totally underused in a role as a sincere scientist. Please give that man some better roles in the near future. Nevertheless a nice touch.Great movie - the three hours flew by. Literally.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Fun Movie,"Martin Scorsese keeps it relatively light with ""The Aviator."" There's none of the foul language or gratuitous violence that characterized his most famous work, ""Goodfellas."" He has crafted a very interesting character study of famous entrepreneur Howard Hughes, mogul of aerospace and maker of B-movies. You see plenty his involvement in both enterprises in this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio seems a little too boyish to play Hughes when he is in his forties, but he clearly is so passionate about his role that you forget the little minutiae such as age difference. He plays Hughes with so much energy that he makes the role all his own. It's pretty clear DiCaprio is having fun with this role. Those who dislike hammy acting may think of DiCaprio as over-the-top, but I liked it. His portrayal of Hughes' various neuroses and compulsions make this a very fun movie to watch, akin to Johnny Depp's portrayal of the equally odd and neurotic Ed Wood.The other actors do a fine performance. Cate Blanchett is fun to watch as the upper-crust actress Katherine Hepburn. She seems to be having as much with her role as DiCaprio, and she's not afraid to ham it up as well. Kate Beckinsdale is fine as Ava Gardner, and John C. Reilly does a serviceable job as Hughes' long-suffering accountant.Scorsese does a competent job trying to portray his version of Howard Hughes' life. He tries to cram down the message of an eccentric man with huge visions that no one else can comprehend. He seems mad when he tries to re-do and innovate his movies or his aircraft. Sometimes his compulsive behavior gets in the way of his dreams, but in the end he deftly fights off the skepticism of his collaborators or the threats from the competition, in the form of Pan Am founder Juan Trippe. He, like Tim Burton's Ed Wood, is an oddball who perseveres and usually gets his way in the end. Burton's is the better movie, however, because it does not have the gloss of triumphalism that Scorsese's movie does. Scorsese tries to portray Hughes as a sympathetic and ambitious individual, and while he may have plenty of ambition, he is not exactly a more sympathetic individual than, say, his airline rival Juan Trippe. Viewers can see through the attempted good-guy image that Scorsese gives Hughes to see the battle between the airlines as one of survival of the fittest.This movie is pretty fun to watch overall. One should see it laid back on a sofa with a bag of microwave popcorn and a can of soda. Just sit back and enjoy the energetic performances. It's not high art, but it is decent cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Exceptionally acted... but not Scorsese's best.,"'The Aviator' is an unusual film in the sense that it features the life of an unusual man. Howard Hughes, a pioneer in the history of aviation and cinema, two completely different fields. It is good that the movie showed enough of his contribution in the history of the former, as the name suggested. A movie meant as a biopic becomes an eye-candy the credit for which should not only go to the filmmakers but also the character Howard Hughes himself. Smart-looking planes, beautiful actresses of that time and also that plane crash in Beverly Hills sequence... all because of him. And it becomes perfect for a moviegoer when such a good plot comes with good acting.It is indeed quite a treat to see all the good actors performing so well altogether. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply awesome. At first it appeared to me he is somehow miscast as Howard Hughes, perhaps because he doesn't just look like him. But his acting was so wonderful that I can't think of anyone right now that could replace him. He definitely deserves his Oscar this time. The changes of Hughes' character with time is brilliantly portrayed, with some scenes where Leonardo proves his mastery like the days inside the hotel room or the last shot of Senate hearing or ""Show me all the blueprints"". Apart from him, 'The Aviator' is also Cate Blanchett's best work. Her appearance was perfect for Katharine Hepburn and she got the accent big time. She just defeated her works in 'Veronica Guerine' or 'Elizabeth'. John Reilly is good as always, so was Kate Beckinsale. I actually would love to see Scarlett Johansson as Ava Gardner but Kate is okay. Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda, however, are not upto that level. And oh yes, as long as we're speaking about acting, let's not forget the brilliant cameo by Jude Law as Eroll Flynn.The point is, all these decent performances by the actors could not make it the best film of the year. 'Aviator' has got a number of problems. The movie is nearly three hours long and it loses track in the middle. The first hour of the movie is very good and interconnected. But after that it just became a collection of separate events glued together. 'Aviator' was never meant to be a documentary film with actors. But that's what it became in the end. Personally I think the film aspect of Hughes' life should have been shown more, along with the aviation aspect of course. Sometimes it appeared filled with too much detailing and unnecessary shots like the opening scene or that scene of urinating in the bottles etc. As a director, Scorsese could not surpass his earlier works like 'Raging Bull' or 'Taxi Driver' or even 'Gangs of New York' with this one. Interesting and unexpected plot twists or showing violence in a simple careless manner, what were his trademark, are absent here. As he didn't get his Oscar from the said three films, I highly doubt he will make it this time. On the other hand, Eastwood has done a hell of a work with 'Million Dollar Baby'.My rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
magnificent movie,"The plot is intriguing, but still lacks a spark that I can't determine .. but good nomination and award",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ambitous but flawed,"Any movie directed by Martin Scorsese has to be worth watching and this ambitious, if flawed, biopic of Howard Hughes is certainly well worth the price of a cinema ticket. As he did in ""Gangs Of New York"", Scorsese works with Leonard DiCaprio who here has the most challenging role of his career so far as the eponymous businessman, womaniser, flyboy, movie mogul, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder-sufferer. Thirty-year old DiCaprio works hard at the role and captures the manic energy, tortured expression and obsessive mannerisms of Hughes, but ultimately his boyish looks make this less than ideal casting. Except for a brief and unsatisfactory childhood scene, the film covers only the twenty years 1927-1947 of Hughes' 70 years, a period which enables Scorsese to present a remarkably sympathetic portrait of this complex character which underlines his great vision and commitment to competition - twin virtues of modern-day capitalism. The man's tyrannical behaviour is excused as the product of genius, while his anti-semitism and near fascist politics are overlooked entirely.Cinema is first and foremost a visual medium and this movie is wonderful to look at. The grand sets and contemporary clothing - enhanced by music of the period - provide a rich evocation of the era, while the appearance in the narrative of so many movie stars of the time enhances the feeling that we have stepped back to a time when Americans were assuming leadership of the world. The realisations of these famous personages is uneven: while Cate Blanchett is brilliant as Katherine Hepburn and a paunchy Alec Baldwin convincing as Juan Trip, Kate Beckinsale is weak as Ava Gardner and Jude Law is disappointing as Errol Flynn.The real stars of the movie, in many ways, are the aircraft, most of which are necessarily CGI creations. We feel with Hughes as he films from the sky swirling dog fights for his film ""Hell's Angels"", takes Hepburn night flying over Los Angeles, sets a new speed record, twice crashes experimental aircraft, and finally lifts the mammoth 'Moose Goose' a few feet off the water. This film of almost three hours is longer than it should have been, but it is at its most entertaining and exhilarating when it conveys the adrenalin excitement and social transformation of modern aviation.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I hope these blueprints are not the way of the future,"I don't think I'll ever quite understand mainstream tastes. This won five Oscars (including for Cate Blanchett's performance??) and was nominated for six others, including directing, best motion picture of the year, screenplay written directly for the screen and Alan Alda's performance?? That strikes me as bizarre to say the least, although perhaps not as bizarre as the fact that the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films nominated this for ""Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film"", or the fact that so many other awards organizations followed suit.It's not that I hated The Aviator--I do think it's worth at least one view, especially if Howard Hughes fascinates you. But although I agree that there is some decent (but not Oscar-worthy) cinematography and production design in the film, and Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job despite other factors, I had serious problems with the directing, the screenplay and most of the performances (which I partially blamed on the directing). Yes, I gave the film a seven, but a low seven, and from me, that means this was almost a ""D"". Or in other words, I'd almost not give director Martin Scorsese credit for this if he turned it in for a university course.The Aviator is a biopic about ""eccentric"" millionaire businessman and filmmaker Howard Hughes (played here by DiCaprio). He also had something of a fetish for aviation, as you could guess from the title of the film. Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan focus on 20 or 30 years of Hughes' life, beginning in the late 1920s, when he was making Hell's Angels (1930), and ending just after the infamous U.S. Senate hearings and the public demonstration of behemoth wooden plane known as the ""Spruce Goose"". It focuses on his dueling obsessions in the film and aviation industries, a couple of his relationshipsprimarily Katherine Hepburn and Ava Gardner, and his increasingly odd ""quirks"".Since a lot of praise is routinely heaped on The Aviator, I want to mainly focus on the flaws that I believe are present. First off, for the material presented in the film, it is far too long, clocking in at just under three hours. Much of it drags, so the first hour and a half feels more like three. Scorsese has actually had a length problem for some time now--it also seriously marred Casino (1995). He needs to hire an editor who will not kowtow to him. The majority of The Aviator consists of people standing around and talking, and they're usually talking about business. That gives it all the excitement of a 9:00 a.m. employee meeting at a company you don't really enjoy working for. Of course, there's more to the film than that--mainly the romances and the quirk exhibition--but the business meeting mode takes up an unusual amount of screen time. The only time the film becomes really engaging is during a disastrous flight that ends in Beverly Hills. Yes, that's an ""action"" scene, but no, I do not only like action films. Just take a look at my other reviews and ratings.However, a more serious problem than the length is the combination of direction and performances. The dialogue, in particular, began to grate on my nerves. I'm not sure that the dialogue as written is bad in itself, but Scorsese directs his cast to deliver their lines with bizarre affectations (and I don't just mean characters like Hepburn who did really talk unusually), and frequently talk on top of one another (and I don't just mean the dinner scene at the Hepburn home). Bizarre affectations can work for me in many circumstances. But here, I do not get the impression that Scorsese was trying to make The Aviator surreal (despite the beautiful blue grass on the golf course), Lynchian or experimental overall. The dialogue-delivery and the performances in general tend to play with an aura of ""Hey, we're making a big Hollywood film now"", or, the whole affair seems affected, pretentious, and ""fake"". Perhaps Scorsese was shooting for awards here. Maybe he gets mainstream tastes. To my sensibilities, it seems that Scorsese and Logan were writing and directing to pander to what a particular type of person wants to hear, rather than writing and directing towards what they think is right/believe in artistically.So I found most of the performances more bothersome than pleasurable, including Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin, both of whom I normally enjoy. Cate Blanchett was particularly grating to me. I've liked her in a couple films, but she's batting closer to .133 for me so far. DiCaprio gave the sole performance--though not Oscar-worthy--that sometimes worked for me. Of course, that's important, since he's the focus; otherwise, The Aviator could have received nowhere near a 7.There are also serious problems with the ""argument"" Scorsese and Logan seem to be making about Hughes. They seem to place some of the blame for his quirks on his mother, but this is very poorly developed. More seriously, there is a very odd absence of showing why Hughes was as successful as he was--and he was successful, and not just due to an inheritance. According to this film, Hughes was primarily a man who made a number of insane and increasingly financially disastrous decisions while others tried to tolerate him. Even odder, there's a sense of Hughes just ""going along for the ride"". We're not really shown any successful business dealings, relationships, or positive actions. Even considering the film purely as fiction, the character doesn't work for what's supposedly happening ""around"" the character.Sure, Hughes' quirks are fun to explore, and this and other aspects do occasionally make the film engrossing--occasionally, you forget to glance at the clock. But there are far more serious problems than assets here, and The Aviator is definitely not worth the inflated accolades it has received.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A film totally without soul,"Watching this film was torture.First there was the soundtrack -- tinny sounding music from the big band era which seemed to be coming from schoolroom intercom speakers. Then there was Scorcese's constantly moving camera. What's up with that? He actually made me feel seasick. I had to close my eyes quite a lot during the film.But worst of all was the treatment -- a story totally without soul. It's fair to compare it with Franco Zeffirelli's recent ""Callas Forever"" which was a touching tribute full of love for the subject matter. There was none of that in Aviator. Scorcese seems not to have liked Hughes very much, which is too bad as it made us uncaring as well.I gave it a 2. Hubby (who was the one who wanted to see it) gave it a 3. You might want to give it a miss!",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Intriguing for those who look above,"First off I must say that clearly this movie is to be commended. It not only allows you to look back at histories most historic advancements in flight, it also allows you see through the eyes of a gifted but eccentric man who revolutionized the world as we know it today. It allows us to learn from this mans message. Emotionally, this movie may not appeal to you. In fact, if you want to experience another romantic dicaprio movie this will not be another titanic. This is a movie about the struggles of business in order to achieve one's passion despite struggling with real life issues. This is not a romantic movie, nore should it be. There are plenty of other options. You could always watch titanic a fifty second time if that's what floats your boat. This is a movie about real life, but most importantly, a movie about no-limits. A movie that reminds us what could be achieved if we look to the stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A moving and heartbreaking story,"I went into the theater humongously skeptical about Leonardo DiCaprio, who seemed too boyish and callow to play Hughes, but came out a true believer. The film was incredibly moving and heartbreaking. Cate Blanchett overdid Kate Hepburn a bit, and Kate Beckinsale, who played Ava Gardner, had none of Ava's edge and sophistication and world-weariness (and no one will ever be that beautiful), and seemed to be playing dress-up most of the time, but those were not big quibbles for me.To watch the gradual descent of this man, who had so much passion and promise, was absolutely devastating, and presented with great care and dignity. Unlike most films that deal with mental illness, the human being came through quite clearly. As usual, Scorcese told a complex story with great wit, compassion, and insight, and tremendous drama and flair. And I didn't realize how long it was until I looked at the time when I left the theater, which is a good sign.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Flat as a Pancake,"This movie has no emotional resonance. It is one of the flattest movies I've ever seen. None of the actors or actresses are able to establish why their characters do what they do, or why you should care. Cate Blanchett was terrible as Kate Hepburn...it was painful to watch her. Leonardo Di Caprio was like a cardboard figure throughout the movie. However I think the real weakness was the writing. How is it possible to take the biographical story of a person who led a very interesting life and make it so boring? This movie may have had some acclaim last year because last year was a very weak year for good movies, as they go.",,Anonymous,Biography
Could have been better Casting,"One very important factor in doing a biopic on Howard Hughes is the casting of the lead. As I watched this film, I wanted to buy Leo as Hughes, but it felt like Tom Cruise playing Hughes. Leo is definitely a pretty boy, and this is certainly the biggest role of his career. But I felt that perhaps someone else could have played him better. Someone else who could perhaps give you a glimpse inside the madness. Russell Crowe, although not a match physically, had that kind of insight in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Alongside that, as much as Cate Blanchett was serviceable as Kate Hepburn, I could easily imagine Emma Thompson personifying Hepburn much better.I have no other major complaints about a film that took eons to make the big screen. It is certainly to the audience's advantage that a film about Howard Hughes be given the big budget treatment. The test flight scenes, as well as the ""Hell's Angel's"" unprecedented aerial scenes are appropriately depicted with top-notch CGI. Perhaps, along with ""Gangs of New York"", having DeCaprio attached was the along way it could get made. For Scorcese, this is his best film in years. He is able to delve deeper into a character than your average Hollywood filmmaker. Scorcese does an excellent job depicting Hughes' descent into madness. The extra length of this film dedicates a good deal of time to this sad aspect. You have sympathy as Hughes fights the takeover of TWA, and the upbeat ending is welcome.The production design is perfect, no corners were cut. Camera angles and pacing are engaging. The make-up on DeCaprio is excellent. The use of period film quality is unique, and creates an outstanding sense of 'living history'. This film deserves Oscar nominations for almost every category, except the acting. Once again, there's nothing wrong with DeCaprio & Blanchett, but they are not perfect.I will probably see this film again, only because I can identify with the seemingly overwhelming odds against you when trying to achieve a personal accomplishment. I also identify with being a misfit, but yet being valued by society.I give it a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Martin Scorsese's take on a 20 year period in Howard Hughes' life can only be called spectacular.,"Martin Scorsese's take on a 20 year period in Howard Hughes' life can only be called spectacular. This film has had me raving since the first time I saw it several weeks back. It is an epic that has everything that makes an epic film extraordinary with its story of a person who are bigger than life itself, combined with great visual effects, wonderfully colorful performances, and exposing the utter genius of Hughes, ""The Aviator"" proves not only be entertaining, but enlightening. Opening with the shot of Hughes as a boy being bathed by his mother and her spelling the word 'quarantine' to him, she instills a fear of disease on what was a fragile mind. We watch how Hughes subtly becomes obsessed with his business ventures into TWA airlines, his scandalous movies, and his building of the world's largest airplane, the Hercules. Furthermore, we see an intimate look at the man from escapades with teenage girls to Hollywood actresses Eva Gardener and Katharine Hepburn, played by Kate Beckinsale and Cate Blanchette, respectively. Blanchette's performance as Hepburn is so colorful and amusing that she proves to be the film's most intriguing performance. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes in an excellent performance. The only thing that works against DiCaprio is that he physically looks young, a look he's had trouble shedding considering he is in his early 30s. But it is easy to disregard considering his dialogue delivery and movements are superb. The film flows at a furious rate for a three hour picture and it manages to hold the audience's attention the whole period without succumbing to a single dull moment. Simply put, ""The Aviator"" is the best film of 2004!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Leonardo v Tommy Lee Jones,"Although I thought Scorcese had done a good job on this picture, I think it disappoints by not really getting to really express just what Howard Hughes was all about. In two and a half hours a lot more story and lot less glitz could have been shown. I have read several books on Hughes including the Noah Detreich tome. The film missed a lot about Hughes the man and really spent too much time on just a few of the movies he made and a fairly watered down version of what the man achieved as an entrepreneur aviator and inventor. Anybody going to see The Aviator to learn about Hughes would not be much wiser after seeing it.However, it is a good film and I enjoyed it. The only problem I have with Martin Scorcese is that he has made so many great films I think I just expects him to be near perfect every time.Just a footnote, an earlier TV movie ""The Amazing Howard Hughes"" with Tommy Lee Jones as Hughes and Ed Flanders as Detreich was a much more informative account of the life of Howard Hughes. If Howard Hughes is of interest to you this version also based on Detreich's book is well worth checking out.After seeing ""The Aviator"" I watched the Tommy Lee Jones movie again on video as I think Leo De Caprio must have also. I mention that as Leo's impression of Tommy Lee Jones playing Howard Hughes was near perfect. Both actors have great talent but which one is most convincing.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Verbally Offensive; Visually Fascinating,"Except for one major problem (for me), this was a very entertaining and enjoyable three-hour film, and I am usually unable to sit through long movies.BAD NEWS - If hearing the Lord's name in vain offends you, be prepared to be offended big-time. This movie may break the record for most GDs said in one major studio film with at least 50. Almost all were said by Leonardo DiCaprio, in the lead role as Howard Hughes. A minor disappointment was that the story ended about 1948. I wanted the see the old man Hughes walking around in Kleenex boxes, in his Las Vegas penthouse and perhaps learn more about the big controversy surrounding his will, a topic that was in the news for months yet I can't recall what the final verdict was.GOOD NEWS - This was very interesting story, start-to-finish. The acting is superb, especially Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. Blanchett is just riveting in every scene she's in, and DiCaprio, for that matter, isn't far behind. My favorite scene in the film might be when Hughes tells off Hepburn's snotty, elitist parents. Great stuff there. No phase of Hughes' life is overemphasized from his flying, his womanizing, his illness, his business dealings and the politics against him. All are given an appropriate percentage of film time.This is a very stylish film, a treat for the eyes courtesy a sharp DVD picture and wonderful camera-work. The fascinating visuals include stunning shots of the airplanes, nightclubs, cars, women, you name it. If the language had been toned down, I would have rated this a ""10.""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Could Have Been Much Better,"I had high expectations for this movie but it didn't stand by the expectations. Neither the movie nor the direction was upto the mark. Half way through the movie, I was bored and wanted the climax to come ASAP. It was irrigating when it ended with DiCaprio saying the same sentence again and again. Main problem was it's pace and the screenplay was also little bit weak. There is some good acting which was saving point for the movie. The only good scene in the movie is when the Howard Hughes character has to defend himself. Overall, this movie could have been much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Big Disappointment - Don't believe the hype,"This film is a big disappointment considering the first rate director, cast and crew. It is an over rated and over hyped grandstanding of a big name, Howard Hughes. What is it with great directors when they get a little too successful? They seem to throw away all the good film-making traits that made them great. The problem is the story - there isn't one. But, gee, the cinematography is so pretty, isn't it. This screenplay is pretty much a rip off of Charlie Kauffman's Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Confessions was ten times better than The Aviator. Now that is how a biography should be filmed. There is no clear story in the Aviator. Of course, this is common for true stories when you want to avoid unnecessary dramatization. But, you would think a genius like Scorsese would pull it off. He does well with keeping things moving for three hours - but the story is lacking. Then again, that may be a Scorsese style. But, it doesn't work here. There was a great opportunity to play with Hughes' psychosis, much like Clooney and Kauffman did in Confessions, and Scorsese made a feeble attempt at it here. But, he gets off track and the psychosis is lost as a very small subplot - even an after thought. The result is a story line that goes all over the place and stays with nothing for very long. Well, that's my first impression, anyway.Nonetheless, despite my rant here, I find this an excellent film. It is compelling. Maybe it's because we know it's based on a real person's life. There's something compelling about stories based on true events. After seeimg this film numerous times over, I added this paragraph instead of retracting my initial statement. Usiually seeing a film over and over makes you tired of seeing it. But this one grows on you. Yes, the Hollywood marketing hype played up the film, which seemed like a lot of hype itself, probably because it's about Hollywood and larger than life characters. So, I don't blame my initial disappointment on Scorsese od DiCapprio. They did a fine job of reflecting what Hughes and his world were all about. It's the reality itself that's somewhat disappointing I guess. That's the trouble with reality. It's just not dramatically focused enough.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great looking film with an only average narrative,"The Aviator is a fictionalized account of the peak years of tycoon Howard Hughes from the late 20's to late 40's.I went to see this movie because I like history and learn about historical figures in the context of the times they lived in.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Hughes, who inherited millions from his father's drill bit company and spent millions on making movies and fast airplanes. Hughes was also a ladies man having relationships with many of the women who worked in Hollywood.I didn't buy DiCaprio as Hughes early in the film. He seemed far too young and in close ups one could see his ""soul"" patch that the actor likes to wear. It wasn't until after the horrific test crash when he gets Hughes' trademark pencil mustache that I started to see Hughes. DiCaprio even had the same kind of wrinkles Hughes had on his forehead when he was intense. That creeped me out.Even with the slight flaw DiCaprio showed the range of Hughes. From driven multitasking tycoon to disturbed germophobic, his acting was great.Cate Blanchett plays Katharine Hepburn, Hughes' first serious paramour. Blanchett gave an excellent performance. You could tell she spent time studying early Hepburn films and reading interviews.Kate Beckinsale plays fiery Ava Gardner. Beckinsale had Gardner to a tee going from loving to tyrant just like the real actress.John C. Reilly played Hughes business manager Noah Dietrich. Dietrich paid attention to the business side of Hughes even though the boss could care less. Reilly turns in another excellent performance.The film was beautifully shot and the time period seemed authentic. I expect that from Director Martin Scorsese but the story misses the mark.Some stories indicated that Scorsese made the film using different color processes to match the time periods in the movie. This is a gimmick only a film geek will love. The only thing I noticed was a dinner scene that had blue peas.Some people will applaud the lack of graphic sex scenes but in this case the film really didn't sell how much of a womanizer Hughes was. They showed him focusing on a woman and sweet talking her till she swooned but there was no sex scenes or even a scene where the couple wakes up the next morning. It would also add some insight to see if Hughes' germophobia affected his sex life. For a man who would freak out seeing a spot on some else's suit how would he ever get through a night of lovemaking.Then there are the scenes where Hughes, on the rebound from Hepburn, is dating a 15 year old. What?? Where did that come from?? The couple are at the local club and no one seems to notice or care. During that time people weren't open with those kind of relationships. Fatty Arbuckle and Charlie Chaplin had run ins with the law over under aged lovers.The best parts of the film are when Hughes is multitasking. Talking to his aircraft designer about a design and in the next sentence ordering scenes cut from a movie he was making. Another great scene is the Senate hearing where Hughes is called to answer the charges he was a war profiteer. There are some great quotes that can apply to our current defense contracting issues. Alex Baldwin, as Juan Tripp, Hughes' airline rival, and Alan Alda as Tripp's paid Senator Brewster were equally slimy as the villains.The film is 2 hours and 45 minutes and the first half seems to focus on Hughes relationship with Hepburn. I am not sure she deserved as much focus as she got.The plane crash sequence went on far too long for what it delivered. Yes, it was needed because it was defining moment for Hughes. He lived with the health issues from the crash for the rest of his life, but the special effect shot just wasn't need to run as long as it did.One special effects shot I did love was filming the climax to the movie ""Hell's Angels"". It was obviously a computer shot but was breath taking none the less.Overall I thought Scorsese channeled Hughes the director too much. There was much that could be trimmed downed or dropped and still tell a good story. What is on the screen is fine but it just misses being a great film.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A movie about a man's OCD. Period,"Suppose Martin Scorsese made a biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt which consisted of three hours of discussion of his affair with Lucy Mercer and his Polio induced disability with only slight attention paid to the Great Depression or WWII. Better yet, suppose the movie ended just after FDR's third inauguration with a Republican foe, played by Alec Baldwin, rising and in two or three sentences, acknowledging defeat and predicting that FDR would end the depression and rid Europe of Nazism and Fascism, making it safe for Socialism.Substitute Howard Hughes for FDR and change paralysis to OCD and you have, ""The Aviator."" Scorsese's thesis is that everything Hughes did was the result of an obsession or compulsion. Hughes compulsively chases (and catches) every beautiful Hollywood actress in the 1930's and 40's. Meanwhile, his obsession with airplanes and perfection drives him to design innovative aircraft that enable him to be the first man to circumnavigate the globe in four days and set new air speed records. We are shown a seemingly endless scene (one of many) in which he is trapped in a men's room because he is so obsessed with germs that he is afraid to touch the doorknob. Strangely, this fear of germs doesn't seem to prevent him from touching the private parts of female movie stars. (It should be noted that Hughes's biographers rarely if ever mention his disorder as occurring prior to the late 1950's.) As if in answer to my most fervent prayers, the movie finally concludes in a 1947 scene (after Hughes has defeated the U. S. Senate and several couples have left the theater, but before he has established his business empire) by having Alec Baldwin, as the head of Pan Am, predict Hughes's accomplishments in the 50's and 60's (which should have been shown in scenes replacing those of catch me, catch me with starlets and Hughes suffering from the OCD he had not yet acquired).Cate Blanchett, currently the best actress in Hollywood, is outstanding as Kate Hepburne. Leo DeCaprio is not credible as a giant like Howard Hughes. He isn't helped by having to spend the duration of the movie displaying a facial expression which seems to say, ""I have to find a men's room, fast."" For this atrocity, Scorsese should be exiled to movie hell in Northern Minnesota making movies about female iron workers filing sexual harassment law suits.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Characters,"I found this movie very interesting because my family history has a lot to do with aviation. In fact, my Grandfather was good friends with Don Smith, who was the real Flight Engineer on the Spruce Gooses one and only flight.I was surprised to hear from my mother who still speaks with Don that he was not contacted when they made this film. He sat in the seat where the movie showed Glen Odekirk sitting, who according to Don wasn't even on the flight that day. He would have been a good source of information, as he was assigned to the goose for more than 30 years after the flight and retired from Hughes Aircraft.Instead they made things up as they saw fit to make the movie more appealing. According to Don, Howard didn't start going off the deep end until after the flight of the Goose. Which was also after the court battle he went through. Think about it, he was pretty far gone by this point in the movie to have bounced back so remarkably to stand up for himself the way he did.They showed him involved with Icon Actresses that we all know and love today, but his true love during the time the movie was suppose to have taken place was an actress by the name of Jean Peters. That's not to say that he wasn't involved with Kate, Ava and others, but I guess making them the main woman in this movie made for a more successful movie, and the truth would have been too boring since most people wouldn't remember who Jean Peters was. I know I didn't!When Hughes crashed the plane in real life he was knocked unconscious and was unable to get the cockpit open, but it was true that a uniformed man ran up to the burning plane and saved his life.The only reason I gave this film an 8 was because of the personal interest I have. Otherwise, asside from some of the air scenes, the movie was boring and very out of sequence. A true blast to the Hughes legacy.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Flies high but not an epic,"""The Aviator"" is an engaging drama which may be the best film of 2004. Then again, 2004 was a rather lackluster year at the movies. Like most viewers, I am not informed in detail about the actual life of Howard Hughes, so I cannot say how revisionist ""The Aviator"" is. The strengths of the film are the excellent acting roles by the leads Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett, vivid period sets, seamless special effects and an interesting story to tell. Howard Hughes is portrayed as a complex larger-than-life character with bizarre instability offsetting his genius. In itself, the movie is a captivating walk through a portion of his life. But that is also its weakness. Without a distinct starting point or ending, the story lacks a sense of purpose. Sure, it is fine to watch, but after all is said, so what? ""The Aviator"" might win Oscars, but it certainly will not become a cultural phenomenon like ""Titanic"" did. On that note, ""The Aviator"" also lacks a memorable soundtrack. Probably about as fine a depiction of Howard Hughes as one could ask for. But ultimately somewhat hollow. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Aviator: Fact or Fiction ?,"""The Aviator"" has all the great elements of a great film yet its still a typical Hollywood movie. There is a great scene when Katherine Hepburn tells Hughes: ""we are not like others, are we Howard?...don't let them(publicity) in because they will make you into a freak"". I think Scorsese did exactly that, he doesn't let you into the real life of Howard Hughes. He feeds you what you have heard or read in tabloids over so many years and there is nothing new you will discover in this film.I don't know why but Aviator didn't feel like Scorsese's film? it looks and feels more like Spielberg or Ron Howard film?. Then again Scorsese's last few films are a far cry from his ""Raging Bull"" days and this is where I was kind of disappointed because Scorsese use to push the envelope and didn't conform so much to the Hollywoood formula. This film with all its great photography and cast yet it remains an empty film and not the work of a great film maker like Martin Scorsese.Aviator got a lot of great reviews and nominated for many Oscars and I admit I did enjoy watching it for its masterful film craft but at the same I think there was so much more about the elusive life of the great Howard Hughes that some how this film refused to even make a hint of it. For example its true that Hughes was a great womanizer but its also true that he also liked to sleep with Men; he lived bisexual life for many years, he had many affairs with stars like ""Cary Grant"" and ""Guy Maddison"", and even ""Gary Cooper"", etc,this is all documented in Darwin Porter's book ""Howard Hugues: Hell's Angel"". This is why again I find the similarities of Spielberg/Ron Howard childish eye candy style of film making, whom both made their own version of books like ""Color Purple"" and ""Beautiful Mind"" and decided to omit that dirty little secret.I just think if you are going to make a film about someone's life why not be more honest; sure Hughes was depicted as being as arrogant with a huge ego but in this day and age to make a film and depict someone so one dimensional which adheres to all myths and tabloids its just playing it too safe for someone like Martin Scorsese. Oliver Stone's film of ""Alexandra"" may have not gotten such great reviews maybe because he debunked how history had depicted Alexandra, but yet he stated the truth written in History about the Greek way of life at that time and Alexandra's relationships with both men and woman; his sexuality didn't make him less of a man and the same would apply to Hughes. However, Stone refused to compromise his integrity as a film maker and I am really sorry to see Scorsese has in the Aviator, and please don't think I am saying because I some some GAY advocate, because I am not, the truth about Howard Hughes has been well known for years in Hollywood.I was impressed with De Caprio's performance mostly in the second half of the film; but I still felt he was too young for this role. If you see any photos of Hughes even in his twenties he looked very mature and even older; he was big man, brisk in stature, 6""4 in height and well built. I once saw a TV mini series called ""The Great Howard Hughes"" played by Tommy Lee Jones and I must say to this day I have yet to see anyone match that performance; because Tommy Lee Jones comes from Texas and even looked like Hughes and he really nailed it, De Caprio doesn't even come close to how Hughes looks or to that performance of Tommy Lee Jones, but for today's young audience they wouldn't even know the difference; De Caprio is picked because he is liked and well known by a wide audience regardless he fit this part or not.Overall this is a good and entertaining film about a fictional version of Howard Hughes but one really has to question how much is fact and how much is fiction?. Perhaps the court hearing are the high point of the whole film, one has to admire and respect Hughes for his integrity fighting for his beliefs and love of Aviation, I hope one day Mr Scorsese does the same when it comes to making films the way he use to.",,Anonymous,Biography
Why Leonardo DiCaprio?,"This is one of those rare films where, if you can ignore the main character, you'll enjoy it a whole lot. Not for one minute did I buy Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes -- I'm guessing the only reason he was cast was his ability to sell lots and lots of tickets to that other big-budget movie he was in. If he weren't a big name, you'd assume the casting people scoured the nation's high school drama clubs, found the prettiest boy, and dressed and made him up to resemble a mature man. DiCaprio IS a competent actor, just 100% wrong for this movie. I also took issue with the pitifully inane reason they came up with to explain all Hughes's mental health problems. Rather than take time to fully explore this in the script, in their haste to get those tickets sold, there is a scene early in the film, with Hughes at age 6 or so, which we're supposed to believe explains EVERYTHING. Not the only biopic to take the easy road -- screenwriters were doing this as far back as Words and Music, wherein we're expected to believe that Lorenz Hart drank himself to death because he couldn't deal with being so short. If you can get past the Hughes portrayal, there's a lot here to enjoy: Cate Blanchett as the insufferable Katherine Hepburn; Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda in the Bad Guy slots; exceptionally fine supporting performances; and some neat special effects. If they had only cast an actor who could convincingly portray a grown man -- not a stretch by any means -- I would probably have given this a 9.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Aviator Soars,The Aviator is a great film that does two things. Gives Leonardo DeCaprio his best performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape and becomes Martin Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas.DeCaprio puts on a fine performance as Howard Hughes and is well deserved of any awards he may get for this film. He molds himself into this role to the point where you forget that your watching Luke from Growing Pains on the big screen. He plays Hughes with a sentimental touch that we feel bad for any unfortunate events that happens to him. Hughes was an over achiever sometimes cocky in the way he had done things. But it was his cockiness that got him where he was. And his money. The film shows the mental problems that Hughes had to deal with including his OCD and his longing for someone to love and take care of him.Scorsese does a great job putting this film together. He tells a great story filled with emotion and suspense while adding some comedic tones that fit right in. The film is almost 3 hours but you never notice the time go by.I give this film **** out of ****,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hollow but visually impressive portrait of America's favourite loon!,"The early life of billionaire flier and racist (not tackled for box office reasons!) oddball Howard Hughes.There are some people whose name comes with a built in full stop. A moment to pause while you think of all those things they did, achieved or represented. Howard Hughes is one such case, but you cannot rank him up with the great visionaries or the great eccentrics like Einstein, Van Gough or Michael Angelo - these people mixed talent with their madness. As director Martin Scorsese is forced to admit (after the entertaining crash-bang has ended) - most of the things that HH came up with didn't work or couldn't work.(Jane Russell never wore the bra he designed for her over-sized breasts - a point that the film skirts around.)Hughes took the money of his (far more brilliant) father and while entertaining with it - didn't spend too much time at school learning the basic rules of flying or film making (you try sitting through anything other than Hells Angels). However with money you can buy your own trophies and good PR- and Hughes had very deep pockets.Martin Scorsese revisits some of his greatest hits and greatest flops in this movie. The long drawn out entrance to a night-club from Goodfellas and the souped-up camp of New York, New York: When you to any night-club in a film you can be sure that every extra will look like a professional dancer and the main players will smoke/drink (although Hughes didn't) and exchange loaded barbs. Amazing how witty the whole world is in films!Leo DiCaprio has an unfortunate face. He is destined to look 15 until late middle age and you can't do a thing about it. Stick all the fluff you want on his face and then add a bottle of hair grease and he still looks like he has stepped out of Buggsy Malone. He is not a bad actor (and getting better) but no one can claim he was cast for anything other than box office. Worse Martin Scorsese uses lighting to try and bring gravitas to his unconvincing appearance. He is just miscast and that is the end of it.Katherine Hepburn (here played by Cate Blanchett: Deserved as Oscar? I'm not sure!) had no taste in men. She liked to be the superior partner is her relationships so she chose oddballs, broke artists and addicts. Maybe these were the few men she didn't scare away. Hughes had money and toys and while it is presented here as some central relationship (Hughes treated all women as if they could be bought, sold or exchanged) it was nothing of the sort. Spencer Tracy was one of Americas greatest actors but also a chronic and incurable alcoholic. In him she found her ideal match!Madness is hard to capture on film. It is often not a level dip. It can come and go, get worse, get better, even be effected by the weather. No one has a clue if it is was two planes crashes (there might have been more) or some disease that took HH out of circulation. Clifford Irving thought Hughes was too mad to dispute his fake autobiography (not featured here) but he pulled himself together. Even from his self-made lunatic asylum bed!It is good to see that Scoresese is back on something like form after a string of so-so efforts. Despite the money he is given to spend on props the quality of actor isn't around to pull this kind of thing off. Too many dough boys with plastic teeth and empty eyes. Without these bricks nobody - and I mean nobody - can make an engrossing classic film. All you can come up with is pretty backdrops and sweeping scores and hope nobody notices the lack of major talent in the speaking parts.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Aviator Soars,"I have been germophobic all of last week since re-watching this gem. Scorsese tells of the 'Life and Madness' of Howard Hughes with such disturbing clarity that I am compelled to read the biography. Hughes fits the bill for an ideal Scorsese protagonist -- manic, obsessive, and brilliant. DiCaprio brings his insanity to life on screen with vivacity, although the Southern accent is lost every time he shouts. Howard Shore's score is also riveting. Despite Hughes' life being wrought with tragedy at nearly every turn, his dedication to his own vision brings about a future hardly anyone else could have dreamed of imagining.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty darn good...,"The movie in general was awesome. As a whole it comes together very well. As far as individual aspects of the film things could of been done better.The parts played by Mr Leo and Ms. Kate could of been more convincing. Ms. Kate's performance seemed like a caricature of Ms Hepburn while Mr Leo's performance seemed a bit shallow, hallow, or mellodramatic. Towards the middle of the film those aspects of their performance seems to melt away to let the story take hold.The musical score did not reflect upon the film very well. One could almost not have music in the film and not notice there wan not any music. All in all though the film was worth seeing and when it makes it to DVD would be worth buying or renting.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Shockingly poor biopic,"Overly long, boring, badly acted and directed. Shocking how badly Martin Scorcese has fallen off, after triumphs such as Goodfellas not that many years ago. Leonardo DiCaprio is incapable of playing grown-up roles, as he continues to look like an overgrown infant even as he pushes thirty-something. I'm amazed at the gushing over Cate Blanchett's grotesque imitation of Katharine Hepburn- Frank Gorshin does a better one. And don't even get me started on Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, who was apparently a sexless, anorexic coat-hanger instead of a bombshell (much to my surprise). However, the greatest disappointment by far was Scorcese, who completely lost any semblance of a storyteller in favor of cheesy CGI effects and bogus dialog. Too bad, because Howard Hughes was a truly fascinating subject- a deeply neurotic multimillionaire, plagued by obsessive-compulsive disorder, but also a true visionary and aviation pioneer. This movie doesn't do him justice.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"hype was exaggerated, not wining the Oscar justified","This was supposed to be one of the greatest film of the year, and a plethora of Oscar nominations gave hope that Scorsese will make it this time. He did not, and he did not deserve it.Not that this is a bad movie. Scorsese knows to tell a story, and as a docu-drama 'Aviator' is one of the best. The problem is that the film tries to be a lot more including to meet the challenge of 'Citizen Kane' - much inspired of the same character. It fails exactly where a film like 'Beatiful Mind' succeeded - in explaining the mix of genius and paranoia, of vision and eccentricity, of the business leader and frivolous entertainer of movie stars. The scene in the character childhood trying to explain the obsession of a whole life is simplistic and lacks not logic, but artistic truth.Worst is the mis-casting of Leonardo di Caprio. I confess that I am no fan of his, and I believe that after sinking 'Titanic' he now crashes 'Aviator'. He cannot track the aging of the character, and he is far of the complexity of Crowe in 'Beautfiul Mind'. As a compensation we have Cate Blanchett, shining as ever in Hepburn's role.Not that it's a bad film. It tells a lot about the period, about aviation and cinema, about the conflict between the South and the North in the American mentality. But is is far from any psychological depth, and does not raise to the level of expectations and of the hype.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great movie, but no masterpiece","This comment on THE AVIATOR deals with the motion picture itself, not with its biographical aspects, since I know too little of the facts concerning Howard Hughes' life.I can say right away that this movie kept my interest, even with its 170 minutes running time. In fact, I wouldn't have mind to see it even a bit longer by adding a few scenes concerning the controversy and release of Hughes' movie ""The Outlaw"". I eagerly wanted to know more about it. When looking at the story, Scorsese choose to ignore the common rules of scriptwriting. Understandingly, since this is a biography. The film has a spectacular opening, then is toned down a bit and uses a slower pace when it comes to the development of events.Leonardo DiCaprio took some time to convince me as Howard Hughes. Don't get me wrong, 'cause in this movie he really proves what a great actor he is, no doubt (pun intended, get it?) about that. But it's just that I found him a bit too young to portray Howard Hughes, especially since he doesn't seem to age much throughout the movie. But he did a very good job on portraying Hughes' mental decay. I wasn't quite too fond on the way Cate Blanchett played Katharine Hepburn. She came on a bit too strong and slightly unlikeable. Maybe this was an accurate portrayal of Ms. Hepburn, but since I'm not very familiar with that actress, I rest my case. The rest of the acting was, as to be expected, very good.I also liked the way the cinematography showed a lot of different tones in color, hereby indicating the different episodes in the time-line of the story. The CGI of the airplane could have used a little more detail, if you ask me. There was even a big error, easily spotted. When Hughes has his attempt to set a new speed-record, the close-up shots of the airplane (with DiCaprio in it) show an open cockpit. The more distant CGI-shots show a closed cockpit. Also DiCaprio's hair doesn't move while flying with an open cockpit (but when he crashes in the field, it does). A few other unrealistic shots are to be found when it comes to special effects, but I won't bother going into them.I ended up liking this movie more than I expected, but it didn't have the same impact as, for example, A BEAUTIFUL MIND (which I consider to be a much better movie). So THE AVIATOR is just a great movie, but certainly no masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Larger-Than-Life Story Of A Larger-Than-Life Icon,"The second collaboration between Martin Scorsese & Leonardo DiCaprio finds the duo bringing on screen the larger-than-life story of a larger-than-life figure. A richly detailed, vividly photographed & brilliantly performed epic biographical drama, The Aviator is another fine addition to the esteemed filmmaker's extensive body of work.With its meticulously detailed set pieces, inventive cinematography & apt costumes, Scorsese takes us back in time to a glamorous era, and paints a fascinating portrait of Howard Hughes from his industry pioneering highs to crushing personal lows. But there are sloppy scenes in between, and its 170 minutes runtime is quite excessive.Leonardo DiCaprio plays the iconic real-life persona with gusto, articulating Hughes' mannerism, interactions & worsening mental health with gripping intensity. And he's well supported by the rest of the cast, especially Cate Blanchett who leaves her own mark as Katherine Hepburn, plus her chemistry with DiCaprio is delightful to watch.Overall, The Aviator does soar under Martin Scorsese's assured direction but there are times when he takes the foot off the pedal, thus resulting in loss of momentum. The commitment from the cast & crew is thorough, the colour grading is a highlight in itself, and the story as a whole makes for an interesting sit for the most part. But unlike his best works, The Aviator isn't memorable.",,Anonymous,Biography
Good but not great Bio-pic,"So what are we to make of the highly touted bio of Howard Hughes.Certainly this is one of the most lavish and spectacular films of the last few years. It looks great is fantastically put together and acted, but somehow something seems missing.As the film unspooled I was never bored but I didn't really care. I didn't really connect with the film. Yes, the film is dramatic but its never involving. I never felt that there was a reason to be watching other than it was a well made film that was somewhat interesting.I'm sure that had it not been a big award winning film that I would have liked it more, but for a film thats up for and won tons of awards I'm left puzzled, a feeling I have about every other Oscar Best Picture nominated film.See the film, its not bad, and do so on the big screen if possible.

"I witnessed the Hughes crash, and the movie solved a family mystery","On July 7, 1946, I was at home with my parents at 618 N. Linden Drive, Beverly Hills. I can't recall the exact time of day but it seems to have been late morning in my memory. I was eleven years old. My father and I were having a game of badminton in the back yard. Suddenly, from the East, what we thought was a Lockheed P 38 at a very low altitude passed nearly directly over our house. Moments later, there was the sound of a crash and explosion, followed by a visible pall of smoke rising into the air from Whittier Drive. The editorial comment about this event said that Hughes had crashed into 805 Linden while attempting to reach the Wilshire Country Club. There is no Wilshire Country Club....the golf course he was attempting to reach was the Los Angeles Country Club, at the time the most exclusive and expensive private golf course in Southern California. In Beverly Hills, homes on the East side of the Streets have even numbers. Those on the West Side have odd numbers. Linden Drive splits off from Whittier at the 800 block. Hughes crashed at 820 Whittier, not 805 Linden. Because there are no homes on the West side of Whittier he could not have crashed into an odd number address. My father ran to the scene and witnessed the Marine just after he had pulled Hughes from the flaming wreckage.My father mentioned to me sometime in the 1940's that his receptionist at his office one day buzzed him and said, ""there is a Mr. Howard Hughes here who wants to see you"". My dad was amazed that Hughes, who he had absolutely no previous contact with, would suddenly appear, alone, informally to see him. He said he was having problems in his campaign for The Outlaw, and wondered if my dad could help him. My dad had a long history in promoting Gilmore gas for Earl Gilmore, and had done a lot of successful promotions featuring lion mascots. In The Aviator, at the very end of the premiere for Hell's Angels, the narrator refers to a leather jacketed man, named Roscoe Turner holding a lion cub named Gilmore. When I saw that I realized the answer to why Howard Hughes had sought out my father for promotional assistance. Roscoe Turner was a top of the line competitive air racer in the 1930's, and his sponsor was Gilmore. That was the link that led Hughes to my dad, and I didn't know it until I saw The Aviator.I found the movie interesting and somewhat difficult to become totally engrossed in. The way it was shot and edited made me constantly aware I was watching a movie production, as opposed to real cinema where you get totally captured and focused on the experience. They had to be selective with a very complex and varied individual and the outcome was a compromise, albeit to me a very entertaining one. Hepburn and Brewster were fantastic. Hughes became more believable as he aged, with the final 10 minutes a masterpiece.All in all, a 9 for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Best of the Year,"The most exciting and intense picture of resent years. Scorsese directs this beautifully lit and moving biopic with the help of the best acting talent around today. Dicaprio shines as the eccentric Hughes. And the seasoned supporting cast keeps up with his dynamic performance in their own unique ways. Alan Alda is brilliant as the seedy Senator from Maine. And Alec Baldwin again perfectly fits the bill as the ""evil"" supporting character. Blanchet turns an impression of Heburn into an entire original character of her own, which leaves the audience begging for a spin-off movie. Perhaps ""Kate"" or ""Kate, the Cursed."" Or maybe she can fight Japanese villains with animals jumping from their chests. Hell, she's Kate Hepburn, why not? The color scheme and set design are beautifully meshed together to form a real feel of that time period. The Aviator deserves every award that it is nominated for. And it is high time for Mr. Scorsese to meet Oscar.Final Verdict: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
not enough entertaining,"Set in the Hollywood Golden Era, this is an excellent and lavish biopic on Howard Hughes, one of 20th century most charismatic and influential figures. Nevertheless, despite its being an energetic and evocative job of recreating atmospheres of the 30's and 40's, I find it's quite disappointing on the whole. The 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime is very, very long, too long. So, though interesting for being a tale about a successful businessman who climb higher, higher and higher (Howard Hughes is somehow a forerunner of many nowadays tycoons), I figure ""The Aviator"" is neither that interesting nor able to catch the audience attention for all the entire time. Besides, Scorsese doesn't manage to get into the lead's head, unveiling men's dark side, like he did in taxi Driver for instance.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too long but the acting was great!!!!,After seeing this movie I have a new respect for Leonardo. I never liked anything that he did beforehand but he was great in this. After seeing million dollar baby last week I didn't think I would like another movie better. I don't like Aviator as much but the acting was well worth it. I can honestly say that Leonardo and Cate Blanchett deserve the Oscar. I came away from this movie feeling an understanding of Howard Hughes that I had never knew before and sadness for the disease that overtook him. Leonardo moved me with his stunning and very moving performance. If you want to see great acting you must see this movie.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good but surprisingly uncompelling,"Much of this film didn't make sense until I watched some of the associated documentaries on the second features DVD. Now I see that many of the scenes are recreations of documented events in Hughes' life.Visually the film is attractive and DiCaprio does a credible job of living the role, but there is little plot or story and overall it tends to drag. I'm fascinated by planes and the history of aviation, so halfway through the film I was surprised to find I was completely uninvolved with this narrative. The story wakes up a little during the congressional hearings, with DiCaprio sparring against Alda - just sufficiently to keep me hanging on to the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sort of like watching a turtle on its back,"Knowing quite a bit about Howard Hughes, I expected to see a movie chronicling his minimal exploits in movie-making and his greater exploits as an aviator and a capitalist who built an airline and an aircraft corporation, took on a senate investigating committee and won, and, oh yes, bedded the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. (NOTE: I was amazed to see that in casting this movie they could find no actresses who could do justice to the beauty of Jean Harlow, Ava Gardner, or even Faith Domergue. That may sound shallow, but beauty is what it was all about. I'll give a grudging pass to Cate Blanchett because of her superb acting. Besides, who ever had the regal beauty of Katherine Hepburne). Back to Hughes: the other interesting fact about Hughes is that at the end of his life he was destroyed by a mental illness we now refer to as obsessive/compulsive disorder. However, few of Hughes' biographers mention the OCD as a significant factor in Hughes' life prior to the late 1950's which is well beyond the time frame of this movie.To my surprise, the movie was about little other than his OCD which, according to Scorsese, was the driving force behind almost everything Hughes did. I could have lived with that, except for the way it was presented. Poor Leo DeCaprio was forced to spend most of the movie looking as if he had just eaten something nasty. I guess that's what OCD does to you according to Scorsese. In painfully long scenes, DeCaprio would stand unable to function while the camera allowed us to stare at him. It was like watching a turtle on its back trying desperately to right itself.People all over the theater were holding up their arms, apparently trying to check their watches as we passed the two-hour mark, and a few gave up and left early. Unfortunately, my curiosity overcame my discomfort and I stayed to the bitter end.Howard Hughes was a much more interesting and complex man than this movie reveals, and his accomplishments were much greater than one would realize from the manner in which they are presented in ""The Aviator"".Leo is not the right man for this role  he just isn't able to radiate the power, self-confidence, and even arrogance of Howard Hughes. Scorsese's Hughes comes off as a victim taking apparently stupid risks because of a mental affliction which in real life he had not yet acquired.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Simply Amazing!,"I've seen this movie two times, and I loved it. There are few movies that can keep you on edge for 3hrs, but I think Scorsese pulled it off. I don't think the movie is as good as some of Scorsese's earlier works like Raging Bull or Goodfellas, but was still enjoyable and should definitely be an Oscar contender this year. The acting was spot on, especially Cate Blancet portrayal of Katherine Hepbure.The screenplay was also very good, and didn't really need anything added to it to make it more exciting, since Howard Hughe's life was so incredible. And everything in the movie is just the first 47 years of his life, fitted into 3hrs. It is one of my favorite movies ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder has it's positive side.,"""The Aviator"" (2004): I don't know a lot about Howard Hughes, and I truly hope that this film played it straight with historybecause it is a fascinating story, and I'd rather it be accurate. (Oliver Stone DIDN'T make it, Martin Scorcese did, so there IS a better chance it honors the truth!) We've ALL heard about Hughes' final, reclusive, CRAZY years, but ""The Aviator"" covers the majority of his years before he lost himself to what I'm sure would now be labeled ""Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder"". The story immediately takes a peek at his childhood, where an important issue is clarified, and we then dive right into his start with aviation. We see his mind working 1,000 miles per hour, flying in 4 directions at a time, and NEVER shooting down ideas. He gambles everything, often, and fights for what he gets. He's no namby-pamby rich boy. You have to admire him, even if you DON'T want to be in his hire. Leonardo DiCaprio does a fine job, as does Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, Gwen Stefani, and Alec Baldwin. The dirty business of politics & payoffs is covered, but so is the glorious, imaginative efforts of Hughes and his engineers. Special effects are excellent, photography is exciting, dialog always interesting, sets & costumes rich with era, scoring greatit's all-around solid character study, and recreation of an era that is worth another look. If you liked the film ""Tucker"", I can assure you ""The Aviator"" will do nothing but top it, which is quite a compliment.",,Anonymous,Biography
A bowl of oatmeal,"And I'll explain that - it is like every flake of Howard Hughes's life was tossed into a bowl and regurgitated haphazardly. For one, his OCD is shown in extremis through parts of the film (he lives naked, surrounded by tissues and bottles of his own urine) and yet he is able to drag himself together and appear coherently in front of a Senate hearing.Yes, I would buy there were tiny signs of his disorder early in his life, but it was not full blown until the last decade.I didn't like Leonardo in the part, he is too much of a one-note actor to handle the complexity, sexiness, power and drive of the Hughes character. DiCaprio is too slight in every way. Cate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn needed a more tenacious grip on her character, her accent and mannerisms were too inconsistent, but then again she was playing off the anorexic performance of DiCaprio.The time-lines were completely out of whack, one example: Katharine leaving Howard for Spencer? No.Ava Gardiner was seriously miscast as well, if anyone has caught her in one of her incredible film performances you will know what I mean, she is woefully ill-served here.Some of these larger than life heroes need a story that will reflect their magnetism and the reality of their lives and with more care taken to the details that are often anachronistic and irritating in attempts such as these. (Example being the opening mommy hygiene scene which is used to back-story his OCD, please, we're not quite that gullible!!) A shame. Some of the bigger scenes are truly wonderful, the scene within the Cocoanut Grove being one of them, the busy backlots and the CGI scenes of the flights being a few more. Also the music was captivating. And marvellous cinematography. Howard was poorly served here. Perhaps the casting of a George Clooney type might have helped. We needed to see the power and complexity. 7 out of 10 for such a big attempt to diminish such a huge character.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
a pleasant surprise,"With apparent effortlessness this film about Howard Hughes does the cleverest little trick. It becomes Howard Hughes - powerful, stylish, and bold beyond all fear of criticism. Complaints of the film's length abound. I find that astonishing. I can't believe Mr. Scorcese didn't need more of my time for what he did - I surely would have granted it. It takes a mere 166 minutes to paint a vast and somehow intimate portrait of one of the most enigmatic figures of the twentieth century. Not a simple task. To begin with, biopics are dangerous territory for any director. The charge: distill a man's life into a few cans of film. Oftentimes Biopics tend to be hollow and external linear narratives - the subject's life from birth to death. Often when this boring mistake is avoided today's directors tend to go in another equally erroneous direction. They'll hijack a man's life, boiling it down to an over-simplistic story arc to frame the film in a contrived but filmicly effective context. I point to Taylor Hackford's RAY in which Ray Charles' life is distilled to a battle with heroin brought on by guilt stemming from the death of his brother. I'm sure Ray was more than that. Or as in MONSTER the life is boiled down to what else but a love story. It is easy to recreate the events of a man's life on film, but is much harder and more interesting to recreate the man himself. Scorcese knows this and he goes after that most difficult target - the essence of the man, the core drive and spirit that made him noteworthy. In conveying this essence Scorcese does something that far too few filmmaker's will do this day. He trusts the audience, laying in almost no exposition, showing rather than telling. He lets his audience fill in the blanks, rather than boring us with information we already know too well, and for that i am grateful. Some hoped the film would dwell more heavily on the death and demise of Howard Hughes, the dirt, the rumors and the insanity. But these are the things for which the daring and irrepressible figure is now most often known, but none of us knew the man. Mr. Scorcese has done a thorough job with our introduction. Please to meet you, Mr. Hughes.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gravitas,"There is casting and then there is acting.The Aviator is well acted, with Cate Blancett in particular turning in an outstanding job.The film is poorly cast because few of the actors have the heft necessary to portray their characters. DiCaprio is a boyish lightweight. Ava Gardner had a presence that her imitator lacks. Hepburn was born to privilege, Blancett merely acts. Alan Alda is charming but not believable as a powerful man. Alec Baldwin, in contrast, suggests the seriousness, complexity, and deviousness of a major business player in the 1940s.What does it mean that the actors of today cannot convey the actors of yesterday? Maybe Errol Flynn is beyond imitation, but I think not. Perhaps preferences for both actors and acting styles now discourage larger-than-life figures. The earlier era valued beauty, boldness, willfulness, and wit, none of which are in vogue.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Scorsese and DiCaprio masterpiece that is an absolutely must see,"The Aviator (2004) is a movie that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows Texas oil drill bit man Howard Hughes who wants to make it big as a movie director as well as design and grow his commercial airline business. He goes head-to-head with some of the biggest commercial airline companies both for commercial flights and government contracts. He lives an exotic lifestyle filled with movie stars, models and issues with germs...he isn't sure which of his interests will lead to his demise, but one of them surely will.This movie is directed by icon Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull) and stars Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Cate Blanchett (Lord of the Rings), Alan Alda (MASH), Kate Beckinsale (Underworld), John C. Reilly (Stepbrothers), Alec Baldwin (The Departed), Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings), Gwen Stefani (Zoolander) and Jude Law (Sherlock Holmes).The depiction of this era is absolutely magnificent. The look, feel and temperature are very well captured. The storyline is captivating, unique and unlike any story ever told. Hughes really was larger than life in his foresight and accomplishments. The cast is magnificent, and everyone delivers a tremendous performance. Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn blew me away, very impressive. DiCaprio delivers a brilliant performance as Hughes, his strange behavior, and how his genius and determination got his success before he went mad. The ending is sad, curious and amazing all at the same time.Overall, this is another Scorsese and DiCaprio masterpiece that is an absolutely must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Bad Leo, strong supporting cast","Martin Scorcese's lengthy homage to Howard Hughes is alternately gripping and aloof and unfortunately is forced to rely far too much on the dubious acting talents of its lead, Leonardo DiCaprio. As Hughes, the perpetually cherubic DiCaprio simply doesn't have enough panache for the role, and the sometimes-garish makeup that's intended to show Hughes' aging merely accentuates DiCaprio's anachronistic performance.The movie spans a few decades in Hughes' heyday, from the 1920s to the 1940s, from his beginnings as producer/director of Hell's Angels to his appearance before a Senate investigatorial committee. Hughes fights with everyone - Hollywood censors, the starlets he dated, his employees, the U.S. government, and rival airline tycoons, sometimes to the benefit of Hughes' myriad business interests, and more often to their debit. The film largely deals with Hughes' involvement in films and in the airline business, choosing to gloss over or ignore entirely his casinos in Las Vegas and the years leading up to his death in 1976.At the crux of things, though, are Hughes the Film Producer and Hughes the Aviation Pioneer. From his long-delayed Hell's Angels - which made him a national star - to his mammary-obsessed The Outlaw, The Aviator shows how single-minded Hughes was in his relentless pursuit of the Perfect Movie. Because he was independently wealthy and could lean on his own funds to keep production moving, Hughes worked outside the traditional Hollywood studio system, shaping Hollywood to fit his own ideas and methods. Not everything worked - and not every idea was well received - but Hughes remained a man unwilling to compromise his principles; some might call this ""stubbornness."" Juxtaposed with Hughes' film travails is his constant drive to improve aviation, from the purchase of what would become TWA to the innovative behemoth Spruce Goose, which unfortunately flew a distance of one mile exactly one time. Hughes is shown as a notorious perfectionist, personally inspecting each new aircraft to see that it met his (unspecified) standards.At 170 minutes long, The Aviator manages to cram in many useful and interesting tidbits about Hughes' life and times, and even though certain aspects of his personality were omitted (such as his alleged aversion to African Americans), one doesn't get the sense that something's missing. This is a credit to the screenwriter, John Logan, although the runtime didn't hurt.As is usually the case with DiCaprio movies, the biggest liability in the movie was Leonard DiCaprio himself. As Hughes gets older in the movie, poor Leo looks exactly the same - and worse, acts exactly the same. Even when he's not laden with makeup, DiCaprio looks like he's about 12 years old and facing the real world for the first time. In The Aviator, he has the gravitas of an empty suit, never appearing to be more than, perhaps, the son of Howard Hughes. DiCaprio isn't terrible in the movie, he's just not terribly believable.His supporting cast is pretty good, though, especially John C. Reilly as his number-two guy and all-around abuse receiver, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, and Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, the head of Hughes' rival in air, Pan Am. When you have strong professional performances like the work these people turned in, the movie can suffer an underwhelming lead. Unfortunately, one of the key supporting roles wasn't quite as fulfilling as it should have been - that of Katharine Hepburn, played quirkily by Cate Blanchett. Blanchett adopted Hepburn's idiosyncrasies and personality tics as well as her odd, off-putting stuttering vocal delivery. Now, I'm not saying the real Katharine Hepburn wasn't exactly as Blanchett portrayed her, but her mannerisms were so over the top that they were distracting and annoying. Blanchett won an Oscar for her performance; I believe a Razzie would have been more suitable.The movie's not much more than an interesting glimpse at a long-dead icon until it reaches the Senate hearings chaired by Senator Brewster (Alan Alda, who also garnered an Oscar nomination). Here especially, Hughes' strength really shows through, although a present-day viewer might wonder how much of the hearings proceeded exactly as depicted in this movie. Alda, by the way, is fine - although I kept seeing those usual Alda mannerisms, which made me think of Hawkeye Pierce instead of a bad-guy politico.Overall, The Aviator isn't quite the epic it wanted to be, and although it's well paced and benefits from fine supporting performances, it does suffer from an unworthy lead performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Decent Scorsese Film!,"The Aviator is a decent film that tells the pre and post World War 2 life of Howard Hughes. I must admit that I was not thrilled when I decided to give this movie a shot. It just did not appeal to me. But with all the hype, I decided to check this film out.As I mentioned before, this is about Howard Hughes, a successful billionaire who is great at having corporate trouble. This film talks about the new kind of films he made back in the 30's. Then, Hughes decided to build the world's largest airplane that may or may not backfire.The acting is probably the high point of the film. Leonardo DiCaprio is a really good job as he usually does. Cate Blanchett is really the must-see of the film. Her portrayal as Katherine Hepburn is a powerful one that even Hepburn herself would be knocked off her feet. I also like Alan Alda.For a subject matter such as this, the film is way too long. This is no Lord of the Rings so I could not be engrossed in the film in several parts.Scorsese does deserve some Oscar consideration(which it did). But, this film is not Oscar-worthy as LOTR is.

Flawed Narrative; Flawed Take on Mental Illness; Great Cate as Kate,"Martin Scorcese's ""The Aviator"" is a long movie -- 169 minutes.A movie that long has got to have a narrative that drives the film from first frame to last, if for no other reason, than to keep viewers from becoming bored.Will Scarlett get together with Ashley or Rhett, for example? ""The Aviator"" lacks that narrative drive. There's no one story that propels the film from first frame to last. What there is is a series of episodes, some interesting, some less so. About two thirds of the way through, the film does get boring. You just want it to finish up.Before that point, there's a lot happening on screen to keep your interest.There's a lot of money on view here. Hughes' film ""Hell's Angels"" is recreated. You get to watch World-War-I era biplanes swoop and fight in the sky. You watch Hughes crash land a plane. This scene will no doubt bring to mind 9-11, as it depicts a plane crashing into inhabited buildings.Best of all, you have Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. This is one of the most extraordinary performances ever seen on film. Stars are stars because they are unique and fabulous; actors playing dead stars usually waste their time -- you can't imitate their charisma and fabulousness; uniqueness is, by definition, inimitable.Blanchett incinerates any doubt you may have had about her ability to pull off Kate Hepburn. Looking nothing like Hepburn, she conjures everything anyone ever loved or hated about her -- the attitude, the voice, the accent.Brava, Cate. She all but renders Kate gratuitous.Kate Beckinsale and Gwen Stefani, as Ava Gardner and Jean Harlow, respectively, can't touch Cate's performance. Luckily, they are on screen for less time.There's a great scene, too, where Howard is dissed at a dinner party by Kate's obnoxious, limousine liberal, Connecticut family. The best such scene I've ever seen, as good as Susan Sarandon's ""I am working class"" from ""White Palace."" But Cate's performance, and that dinner party, take place in a void. There's no long-line narrative into which they fit, working to bring the movie to a powerful climax.To the extent that the movie does have a long line narrative, it is a narrative so grim and unappealing that most viewers, if they knew that that's what they were buying a ticket to see, might pass.The real Howard Hughes was famous for dying an ignominious death, made ugly by his untreated mental illness.Throughout ""The Aviator,"" there are scenes hinting at Hughes' eventual complete mental breakdown.For example, Hughes and Hepburn dine out. Erroll Flynn, wonderfully played by Jude Law, visits their table and upsets Hughes' carefully arranged dinner plate. Once Hughes' peas are rearranged, he can't eat. He leaves the restaurant in a panic.The background of this scene is very lush. Law is as good as Erroll Flynn as Flynn himself. What you are left with, though, is that very creepy, disturbing image of a grown man who is so deviled by undiagnosed, untreated mental illness that he can't finish a meal if one of his peas is moved.Creepy. Sad. No Exit.The most the movie comments on this tragedy is to suggest that Hughes' mother made him crazy. This is shameful. For years mothers were blamed for making their children schizophrenic or autistic. These outdated, misogynist ideas wounded innocent people and did not help the mentally ill at all. What was Scorcese thinking? Was he thinking? Scorcese's inability to deal, intelligently, with the theme of mental illness reflects his inability to bring the viewer close to Howard Hughes. I never felt, while watching this big budget, splashy, technically impressive movie, that I was learning a single thing about Howard Hughes. I never felt that I was being brought into his mind, heart, drive, life.I don't know if this was the fault of the script, or DiCaprio's performance, or Scorcese's direction.I left this lengthy movie, though, without new insight into Howard Hughes.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Million Dollar Baby's got NOTHING on This!,"This is a great film. Don't be put off by the long running time. It flies by and is over before you know it. It really leaves you wanting more. Despite the fact that I often call him Decrapio, Leo really shows that he's a very capable, even (gasp) good actor. He really brings out Hughes' personality (whether this movie is an accurate portrayal of Hughes or not, I don't know nor do I care) from his start in the film business with hints of odd behavior to his aviation skills to his descent into paranoia and OCD. I daresay that this is Scorsese's best-looking film. The crash sequence is simultaneously beautiful and deeply disturbing. It gets a little artsy here and there but overall it's breathtaking. It loses points for two things. First, I never felt much sympathy for Hughes for most of the film, except for the end, where his disease overtakes him. I don't know if this is the fault of the character, the script, or the actor, but I felt an odd detachment throughout this film. The other is Cate Blanchett's role as Hepburn. It struck me as more of a parody of her than a portrayal. But this should not stop anyone from watching this film. It's not a classic, but it's still a great and memorable film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mostly successful,"The Aviator is a grand epic piece of filmmaking. It has vivid costumes, elegant art direction, and great cinematography as its to be expected. The script is very good and the film is mostly entertaining,a nd the performances are great. Leonardo Dicaprio gives the best performance here, and whenever I see him in a film I have to remind myself that he has not yet won an Oscar, and what shame that is. Cate Blanchett as well adds another impressive performance, although as far as a performance goes I liked her as the film went along more. At first she just seemed like a cartoon character, but if the real Hepburn acted that way then who am I to judge. Although this is an impressive picture it is not as great as The Departed or even the recent Shutter Island but it does build impressively in Scorsese's filmography.",,Anonymous,Biography
"A Jumble, just like its subject - Howierd Hughes","I would not have seen this film if my wife had not bought it on the sly. My prejudice is based on a personal bias against the Star, the person (Hughes) represented, the State where our man was born, and the Director. Armed with this sort of informed doubt, I am seldom burdened with a dud movie. We have a large collection of DVD releases, a small house, and limited storage space. Any addition to the collection has to be good enough to bump some earlier selection out to the Thrift Store shelves. In other words, to earn a place on our shelf, a film has to be a convincing WINNER and BETTER than something else already there. So, it was with misgivings that I agreed to sit through ""The Aviator"". So, I did. My wife loved it (or, the Kate Hepburn part). I hated it, all of it.It would have been sufficient for the director to simply state that ""HH"" inherited much more money than he deserved and got on with the business of playing with it. And, with anything else that came his way. The ending could have come next but that was somewhere in the muddle (er, middle) just before ""HH"" leaped out of bed and raced to the Government Hearings to protect his good name. Our man was really upset when he divined somehow that he was not believed and that made him a liar! (""...I am not, nor I have been, A LIAR!..."") Hmm, reminds me of Nixon telling us he was not a crook. Onward.(In fairness, ""HH"" was quoted as saying that other companies had signed contracts to deliver defensive weapons that became obsolete with the end of World War II. Furthermore, those companies had not delivered unwanted weapons. How short sighted he was - we still see some of those aircraft flying around to this day. We could use some more of them, too. Forest fires, don't you know?) Well, ""HH"" hocked the farm to get TWA (Teeny Weenie Airlines?) off the ground. This was interesting. It seems that there really was a bad guy after all. The U.S. Government. NO! That was Juan Trippe, president of Pan American Airways. All that fellow wanted was a monopoly of passenger business everywhere. Sheese! Another Henry Ford/John Rockefeller. ""HH"" resented that fellow.I grew up about 3 miles from the Hughes Aircraft factory over near Loyola College; I heard about the ""Spruce Goose"" but never had a glimpse of it - did not see it moved by truck - did not see it taxi and do wind sprints out in the Harbor - Saw the huge hangar where it sat for decades. I never even got into the geodesic tomb built for it in later years. - Just heard a lot about it. I do remember that ""HH"" and a crew of dozens (3 to 5 per engine) drove it out into the Harbor and ran it back and forth and that he actually lifted it out of the water for a short run. Local press derided him for not getting it up further - we were all disappointed. Not in the movie, however. There he gooooooooeeeeesssssss!!!!!! Yay! I finally caught up with it in McMinnville, Oregon in 1995. It was sitting in a parking lot, not assembled yet. Phooey. (""HH"" also built a huge helicopter for some reason.) Where were we? Oh yes, ""The Aviator"". The special scenes showing the crash of the TurboProp showed the right wing slicing through the wall of a house that must have been a thousand feet long and all built from rice paper. Yes, ""HH"" was lucky. And obnoxious. The film did nothing to correct our impressions of him. As it turned out, ""HH"" was just another shark in the Hollywood Pool. At least his aircraft were interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Made well, but the plot sucked","Martin Scorsese's The Aviator is a depiction of the life of Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes was a pilot, a billionaire, a businessman, and before anyone else, a ""womanizer"" and a victim of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). He cared very much about what he did, and demanded a good title, not the rich boy from Texas. Now, did this movie, with Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, portray his life well? First we need to look at what Hughes' life was. In a sense, his problems started with his mother. In the beginning of the movie young Howard Hughes is being adamantly bathed by his mother, ensuing the OCD, and talking to him on how ""he is not safe,"" ensuing paranoia.This is normal for one of Scorsese's films, considering many of his main characters have problems and/or are trying to find their way in life. The director did portray the drama in Hughes life, putting special emphasis on the presses flashing light bulbs, screaming, stepping on light bulbs, etc. I, personally did not like how much emphasis they put on the drama. I think they made the film kind of confusing on what it was really about, which makes it hard to do things like this. When I walked into the theater I thought I was going to see an awesome film about planes, and movies, because that's what Howard Hughes is essentially known for, by most people, but it trailed from film, to aviation, to the drama in his life and women. I thought to much was focused on the women in his life such as Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani), Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), and other teenage whores.Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job, however, of transitioning through these. So I guess it made it less abrupt. He also did a good portrayal of Hughes in general, making his passion for what he did believable, and I was impressed by the determination he bought to life. He did an excellent job as Hughes, but personally I didn't think it was the best portrayal of a character, but that's my opinion.Now, this is one of the best portrayals of a character that I have seen, Katherine Hepburn, played by Cate Blanchett. Just a few things that made it good, the looks, the fake laughs, the accent, the attitude, the words she used, it was brilliant. I would like her to win her Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress.This is one thing I like about directors like Martin Scorsese, Peter Weir, and others; they get really into there movies. They make sure they are down to the point historically correct, and they actually care about them, and in a sense they are the only people who produce it. For example, Scorsese recommended to Blanchett to watch Hepburn's first 15 movies to get everything down, so she did, and she also took cold showers, something Hepburn is known for, whether that helped her acting or not I don't know.The movie portrays two decades of Hughes' life, and Scorsese must of wanted it all because he put it into a long, dragging 3 Hours (2 hrs. 46 minutes). What is interesting is it won the Oscar for best Film Editing, but they should of edited out about an hour, then I would understand.Another thing I didn't like about The Aviator was that it kept switching plots. It's called The Aviator, so plane people go in there, rightfully expecting aviation, and aviation is 25 % of the movie, I went in there because I heard of his movies, another 25%, etc. I liked the movie, but I thought it was a good movie for people who have never heard of Howard Hughes, it sums in basic terms.It had the lead in the 2005 Oscar Nominations, 11 total, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Leonardo DiCaprio and Best Supporting Actress, Cate Blanchett. However it went home with only five, Best Supporting Actress- Cate Blanchett, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Excellent, the best of 2004","The Aviator is my personal favourite film of 2004. I was amazed at the story-telling and the wide mix that made this film. It's a documentary, and it is blended with action, romance, psychology, history, and a great music track. The attention to detail and the picture is excellent. Scorsese does a fine job portraying the mood for every scene in a combination of images and audio. The characterisation is done as brilliantly as some of Scorsese's other films. If you are looking for an excellent storyline, characters, and cinematography, then you must see this film. It stands on its own very well - as a story and as a biography. (For those of you who think that this movie 'has got to be boring' because it is a historical biography, I am telling you that I did not find it boring at all.) You have got to see this film. It's great.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Historically inaccurate, cinematic ally very good","The Aviator is not meant to be a historically accurate representation of Hughes' life and isn't. That being said, it's an excellent film. The acting is top notch and the special effects work very well with the tone and spirit of the movie. Martin Scorcese is at his best in the directorial department. Leonardo's acting is worthy of an Oscar but I believe he will be denied one. This movie is worth watching for Di Caprio's performance alone. Cate Blanchett is a little unbelievable as Katherine Hepburn even though she gives it her all. The pacing was a little up and down as. Not the greatest movie you will see but definitely one of the best of the year. Watch it as a work of fiction and you won't be disappointed. Don't wait for the DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too long,"It just is too long. And although I think Martin Scorsese should've gotten his Oscar for another movie than this (so the decision was right not to give him one here imho), I also think he made better movies than Departed. Then again Departed delivered and satisfied more than this!The acting from Di Caprio is good (much better than in Gangs), although some of the scenes (or better the script) seems to let him down. Even a scene in a cinema hall, really happened (the movie is based on real characters, fyi if you didn't know already), it just didn't translate that well on screen, imho! And the real characters? I do think (and I'm not the only one, as friends of mine have told me), that some actors/actresses have been miscast. The fact that I'm not fully aware of all the H. Hughes stories shouldn't make a difference in my viewing pleasure, but then again they might have made this experience a bit lighter (and heavier at the same time, because of the length) for me ... Not a bad movie/biopic by any mean, but nothing I was excited about afterwards either!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Aviator Flys-Doesn't  Soar,"Leanardo DeCaprio was entirely the wrong person to play Howard Hughes DeCaprio is a pipsqueak while HH was 6'3 . Also HH had dark eyes not brilliant blue . Gwen Stefani should stick to warbling trash and stay away from acting entirely, her brief turn as Jean Harlow is grating like fingernails on a chalkboard . There is precious little of where HH got his money.He inherited a million on his 21st birthday .Nor is there ample explanation of how or what caused HH to disassociate from the world .His mother bathing him well past the age that it is necessary and her going on about germs and such hardly seems to be enough . It was said during HH's father's day ""Sure you can still drill for oil without a Hughes bit, as long as you don't mind using a pick and shovel "". HH's father was the real genius of the family having invented the rotary drill bit for oil exploration . By the way HH's Inheritance in todays dollars is the equivalent of ten million .Plenty for a young man to reinvent the world in his image . Much is made of HH's flying exploits but not much time is given to the 'Spruce Goose' that only managed to reach 70,feet of altitude and only flew for a mile ,hardly impressive stats .Yet Hughes was convinced this aircraft was the salvation the armed forces were looking for . Not much is said about HH's contacts with the CIA and his involvement in many shady deals perpetrated by that agency . Jude Laws cameo as Errol Flynn is alright I suppose as they are both effete in nature . As HH has very little connection to todays generation(movie buying public) this film will flounder and die in a relatively short time . Michael Mann was right to walk away from this project as there just isn't anything new or revealing to say about HH . The script is no revelation nor is the direction . 2 of 5 stars for the 'Aviator' And bye the way all these people debating'Aviator's' opening grosses are missing the fact that only half of the actual gross accrues to the studio the other 50/60% is eaten up by the theaters . So on that scale'Aviator' is without a doubt a bomb . It will be extremely lucky to gross thirty million domestically and will probably do the same over seas . The only thing that can save it is an unprecedented run on DVD .",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A modern masterpiece,"I find this film to be the best of 2004, easily. The sets and lighting are rich and colorful. The film clearly has the visual style and technical prowess that it deserves and needs for its story. The story itself spans Hughes life for 20 yrs. From the filming of his first film ""Hells Angels"" to his flying of the spruce goose in 1947. The performances are also of note. Especially Leonardo Dicaprio, finally shedding his teeny boy image with his portrayal of Howard Hughes. Gritty and realistically playing a man of many demons and phobias. Also of note is Cate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn. She is magnificent while making Hepburn a real person instead of the impersonation she could have been. Also praise must be said about Alec Baldwin( with the best use of the f word in in modern movies), Alan Alda, Danny Houston, Matt Ross, John C.Reily(strongly playing Noah Deitrich), Adam Scott and Kate Beckinsale expertly playing Ava Gardner. This film is a treat for movie goers who loves films from all eras. The score, performances, lighting, camera-work, directing, script and the production itself sore as some of the best in recent years. A must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The story of a man who was a success at being a failure,"The first time I saw this film I thought, ""It's pretty good,"" but the second time I watched it I came away with a much different perspective.Most of us knew about Howard Hughes' obsession with germs and about the Spruce Goose but not a lot about his early years or the extent of his involvement with airplanes.""The Aviator"", but virtue of its very title, lets us know that flying was Hughes' magnificent obsession and everything else came second.Watching the film the second time I was stuck by the importance of color. At first I thought something was wrong with the color on my television because when Hughes and Hepburn are playing golf the grass and leaves are a bright turquoise instead of green and the color of the sky looked odd too, yet the flesh tones were correct. Then it hit me that the color must have been ""correct"" too, according to something Scorcese wanted to imply. What that might have been I don't know but it got my attention and the colors kept my attention for the rest of the film.Vibrant decor and flashes of colors showed up throughout the film while the clothing and characters remained bland in comparison. People wearing brown jackets and slacks stood in rooms with bright green upholstered furniture or dark red walls, and the people seemed to fade into the background. Your attention was on their surroundings, not them, so that you concentrated on what they were saying instead of what they looked like.But what do I mean by saying it's the story of a man who was a success at being a failure? Hughes, for all his billions in financial assets, never truly was a success at anything, according to this film.Hughes' movies could never recoup their extravagant costs, he kept losing (or driving away) the women he loved, and even all his aviation dreams fizzled out when he lost contracts and ultimately a whole airline. He put too much of himself into everything he did, trying to achieve perfection, which only pushed him further and further away from it, and I came away from the film feeling sorry for Mr. Hughes. Whether that was Mr. Scorcese's intention, again, I don't know, but that was the message I got.If you're looking for just another biopic where characters are explained to death and situations are always resolved, this isn't the film for you. But if you're willing to relax and let the images and characterizations take you over in a more subtle way, you're in for a treat.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Trip Into Madness,"I saw this movie maybe a year or so after it came out, but I don't think I really appreciated it as much back then. I just watched it again from one of the movie channels and I'm really blown away at how good it really was.I know some here have mentioned Leonardo's portrayal of Howard Hughes OCD as being extremely good. I found it to be almost too god because as Howard Hughes slipped further into madness it became more and more uncomfortable to watch because it seemed to ring true. Without a doubt he captured the Howard Hughes we've seen from public clips, but also the Howard Hughes as reported by others. What a great study.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Dedicated and Colourful, didn't move me an inch","Scorcese was, until the creation of ""The Departed"", the black sheep of the Oscars. In ""The Aviator"", Scorcese delivers an outstanding carnival of eccentric clothings, fresh visual tones, and sly filmography scenes. Seeing the movie, one utterly is deviated into the majestic scenario of powerful dresses, settings, decorations that the focus on Howard Hughes is sometimes lost. Di Caprio applies fabulously to his work, so does Cate Blanchett and Alan Alda. There is a gigantic cast; which will fascinate you with the presence of stars. The luxury and excess of the movie is the contrast that sharpens the grey and unmoving story of Hughes. We like his story, we understand his fall but it doesn't emotionally move us. Scorcese has derogated into a path of visual content and left aside unpolished the strength of what meant to be a great biopic.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Very good movie, but not a best picture of the year","Let's see...I liked the movie, I think it was s smart and captivating portrait of a great American personality. The cinematographic quality was, to me, stainless. The script was wonderful and the performances...astounding! Leonardo Di Caprio, although not my favorite actor, did an amazing job playing Howard Hughes. I did not really trust him to play a character like Howard Hughes, but he did it wonderfully. It has to be said that it must not be easy to play a paranoid and psychologically affected character such as Hughes and he really deserved the Oscar for his performance. Cate Blanchett was delightful to see as Katharine Hepburn, she manages to show in the screen the charms and tenacity of the legendary actress. She was amazing and I was glad to know that her performance was not ignored by the Academy. The movie was filled with the glamour and excitement of the 40's and 50's. Yet, I think there was definitely something missing, the picture was probably too long, slow and had a controversial ending that can be thought to be great by some and unsuitable by others. My overall comment is: A great picture that deserves to be taken into consideration, but not enough to be considered a masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good but not great.,"I give this 6 star out of 10.I would have given this 7 stars but the ending was not well done. I have to admit, I liked this movie although I did not want to since I cannot stand Di Caprio. That being said, he performed the part of Howard Hughes very well.The movie focused on parts of Howard Hughes life I did not know about. Howard Hughes was a rich man who inherited a fortune from his parents' business of making machinery tools. He, however, was not interested in the tool business and came to Hollywood to make movies. While making movies, he became interested in aviation as a result of making the movie Hell Cats. He created the now-defunct airline TWA. He became embroiled in personal battle with Juan Trippe, who was the head of Pan Am Airways. The film also showed how Trippe used his influence with public officials to stop TWA from expanding its business into Pan Am territories. In between all these projects and battles, he had time to date many women including starlets.I knew these facts, that I mentioned above, from seeing a documentary about him a while back but I did not know the intimate details of the relationship of some of these women he had relationship with and how his battle with Juan Trippe nearly drove him over the edge. Speaking of over the edge, I had no idea Howard Hughes had a huge OCD problem or obsessive compulsive behavior problem. This movie showed how this behavior became a constant thorn in his side.I could go on and on but I really liked this movie and this is in spite of Di Caprio and also Alec Baldwin. Now the reason why I gave this a 6 rather than 7 or above is that the movie does not go further than early 1950's of his life. I want to know more. I think a good biography of a person should show his beginning and also the end. Maybe the creators of this movie did not want to make a long movie but it leaves movie goers with only a half view of his life.Another thing I had problem with is the choice of actress to portray Ava Gardner. Ava Gardner was truly a stunning woman and the actress who portrayed her was pretty but does not come close to being on par with Gardner. With all the beautiful girls out there who are trying to make it into show business, couldn't the movie makers pick more beautiful actress to portray Gardner?",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A gorgeously dressed corpse of a movie,"So many people have already posted about the liberties this movie takes with Hughes' life that I won't waste time repeating them here. That said, I can always ignore a movie that plays fast and loose with history if there's an original point to be made. Unfortunately The Aviator doesn't have a point. After nearly three hours the film fails to demonstrate why we should ever have been interested in Hughes in the first place.The Aviator's production values are indeed as lavish as the hype suggests and no one can deny Scorsese's ability to move his camera in ways that make every film-school wannabee go weak at the knees. But a slick way with a camera is meaningless if your central character is unengaging. Not only that but The Aviator's woes are compounded by a meandering narrative that lacks a unifying theme (poor Marty has never been at ease with mainstream narrative).I also question the emphasis on Hughes' time in Hollywood given that those years occupied such a small proportion of Hughes' own life. In terms of the overall theme of the film it's not at all clear what point is being made as we watch Hughes make 'Hell's Angels' and romance Katie Hepburn. I have the horrible feeling that everyone involved felt that lavishly recreating the golden years of Hollywood, complete with some of its most famous names, would be a sure fire route to that coveted Best Picture statuette. For once I'm glad to see that the Academy was not so easily fooled.Then there's the fatal miscasting of Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes. He's a good actor but in both looks and ability he's at least a decade too young for this role. Is there really any surprise that The Aviator crashed and burned at this year's Oscars? There shouldn't be. The Aviator's technical credentials are impeccable - it looks sumptuous and sounds great - but that elusive spark capable of bringing a character memorably to life, allied to a vision that knows how to take real life and shape it into a compelling dramatic unity, all of that is absent here. The Aviator is the kind of movie you find yourself forgetting as you watch it. Truly, a 'gorgeously dressed corpse of a movie.'",,Anonymous,Biography
A great film about a very unusual man.,"THE AVIATORThis film is a biopic about Howard Hughes, the film director, producer, businessman and aviator.Howard had some problems in his life including an anxiety disorder. He was obsessed with hygiene and cleanliness of everything. He had to wash his hands every time he shook someones hand.The film is very interesting. I didn't really know much about Howard until I watched this. The story is gripping and interesting, his career and relationships with the people in his life was a roller-coaster.The casting was perfect in this film. Everyone played their characters brilliantly. Leonardo DiCaprio played Howard. He did a great job. I always hated Leonardo, but the more I watch if his work, the more I think he has a skill with acting. Other cast members are Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Ian Holm, Gwen Stefani, Jude Law, Brent Spiner and Willem Dafoe. A few of these actors only made cameos, but they made their mark on the movie. I was surprised at how well Gwen Stefani acted. I am a fan of No Doubt and I know she can sing, but she is a talented actress too. I hope she makes more movies as I would like to see more of her work. Cate Blanchett played Katharine Hepburn... she was so annoying. I hope she wasn't like that in real life... she was really irritating the way she was and spoke.The way this film was shot was brilliant. Martin Scorsese does a great job again. The scene where Howard crashes his plane into the houses was absolutely immense. It looked amazing and was by far the best scene in the whole movie and even the best crash scene I think I have ever seen. That scene will stick in my mind for a very long time.I have never seen a Howard Hughes movie, but I will be looking out for one to see what it is like.I will give this film 7 out of 10.A very entertaining movie, but don't take it all as fact as all biopics are not 100% true.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ain't that a kick in the head?,"Leonardo Dicaprio here is starring at Howard Hughes one of the most filthiest people alive in his day. Notorious for frivolous projects and chasing women, Hughes basically set a cornerstones for the Hiltons and the Trumps for today. Martin Scorcese of course, does a marvelous job of taking us back in time. This time during the 1930's, when everything was almost coming down, except for the extremely rich. DiCaprio is actually quite fun as Hughes, playing every tick and nuance (I was especially impressed with how he portrayed his obsessive-compulsive disorder). The supporting actors are all great too with of course the truly amazing Cate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn. I'm just amazed she pulled this almost impossible task off the way she did.. No wonder she won an Oscar for it! All the rest of the cast is quite good too. (I especially loved my main man Alec Baldwin as the sneaky Pan Am Chief.. Go Alec!). The only problem I had happens 2/3 of the way through, with Hughes' dementia getting progressively worse. I think that segment could've been trimmed down somewhat. Finally, I just love the in-joke that no one seems have picked up on with the throwaway line about the preview of Lon Chaney's 'London After Midnight', which is a classically 'lost' film, and a film Scorsese is nuts about, so that was interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderfully made film based on Howard Hughes,"The Aviator really is a fantastic film. The acting is so wonderfully done! I adored Cate Blanchett gives an impeccable portrayal of Katherine Hepburn. I mean everything from the voice and the behavior to her emotions. Very well deserved academy award victory! And of course Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job with his representation of the famed Aviator Howard Hughes. He is charming when the film calls for it, acts like a real old timey gentlemen, but then he can turn into a totally unhinged crazy person. And DiCaprio handles both kinds of demeanors very well. The script is very intelligently written and it gives such lengthy character development for both Hughes and Hepburn. I just adored the scenes that involved monologues by either Hughes or Hepburn, or scenes where it's them conversing back and forth. The acting is so involved and as I've mentioned, the script provides such deep character detail that when you combine those two things, it makes for an absolutely magical moment. And there are plenty of those kind of moments. The film handles the final stage in Hughes's life well, him going crazy, locking himself naked in a theater room. Long nails, long hair, completely naked, it would be an understatement to say he went ""mad"" towards the end of his life, and Leonardo plays this so well! Very realistic and it all flows naturally, doesn't seem forced in the slightest. Overall a fantastic film based on real people. 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Interesting story, but too long and rather dull","A story about a rich guy, who invests all his money in flight, and fights his way among politicians and competitors. Interesting story, with full of animation and emotions, but too long and rather dull. It's not a love story, neither a drama, nor an adventure. It wants to be everything and comes to be nothing. I've been expecting a much more better movie from Scorsese, however I think the problem lies in the script. DiCaprio brings an excellent performance, but all the other talented and illustrious actors are just puppets on the stage. Recommendation: If you don't have anything else to do, you can watch it.

The way of the future is here!,"I don't know what drives Martin Scorsese to make biography pictures. Is it that he wanted to win an Academy Award before earning his first statute from The Departed? Is he really fascinated by these characters he's making about? To be honest, I don't know. But whenever I think of Martin Scorsese , I think about the techniques he uses in his movies from quick editing to fast-forward motion where I am just stunned to see how wild and brilliant Scorsese is.""The Aviator"" deals with the ups and downs of Howard Hughes (played wonderfully by Leonardo DiCaprio) where not only does he want to make airplanes using the money from his oil tycoon business, but manages to change history as well. He gets involved with movie stars such as Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett as a marvel), Ava Gardner (the delicious Kate Beckensale), Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani, making her film debut) and many other babes including a sixteen year old. While Howard is not only being a mesmerizing playboy and showing off his airplanes, he wants to make movies as well. He makes two of the most harrowing pictures of the early 1930's from ""Hell's Angels"" and the original ""Scarface"" where not only do people consider him a wacko because of the violence, but a genius at the same time.Just like every popular celebrity in town, there are a couple of enemies that want to slander and rid Hughes of any business. There's Pan-Am flight manager Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) who wants to know the secrets to Howard's new airline plan TWA. Trippe has a sneak on board by Maine republican senator Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) who know the tricks in making Howard suffer.Throughout the film we get to see Howard's personal problems, and I'm not talking about girl issues, I'm talking about the obsessive compulsive disorder where it's one of the main sides of his downfall leaving everybody to wonder and how he'll succeed if this little disease keeps up with him. He's afraid of germs; he washes his hands more than once; he shuts his mouth tight if he can't get his words right. What a horrible feeling that must be.Other characters in the film include Noah Dietrich (the gifted John C. Reilly), who is an incompetent bag of hammers that is the fool to Hughes ' King Lear. Glenn Odekirk (Matt Ross) is Hughes' flight engineer who finds Howard's behavior a little strange. Professor Fitz (Ian Holm) is hired by the eccentric engineer to find out if the wind resistance is good or not.""The Aviator"" may not suit everybody's expectations, but Scorsese never fails on bringing energy just like his other films. I think what made Scorsese make this movie was the fact that he was a fan of the atmosphere of the glamor of the 1930's where most of the movies he watched became his inspiration for making films.And somehow he gets to go back and make his dream come true in one of the most moving biopics I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Disappointing,"Martin Scorsese has never really let me down with his films. Also at times when I was thinking: how are you gonna find your way out of this massive disaster? it turns out to be a good film (like in 'Gangs of New York'). Leonardo DiCaprio has a way of surprising me. When I think: O my God - not another film ruined by this teen-idol! it actually comes out as a great movie. He sure is a talented actor.But both prominent Hollywood figures did let me down this weekend. This weekend I saw The Aviator. It wasn't a bad film, not at all. The story is interesting and the acting is very well in some parts. Not to mention: John C. Reilly is playing (as always) a great role. But The Aviator never leaves a mediocre level - it's predictable, it babbles on never really being exciting in any way. The trailer makes us believe that it will be the epic we've always been waiting for. But it isn't at all. It is just a film about a tragic figure and a world that doesn't understand him. That intriguing fact is overlooked by the cinematographic violence and outdated visual effects, so the real tragedy never becomes really visible. For that reason I do not understand all the laudatory criticism - it could've been a brilliant movie if Scorsese had let this habit to overreact at home. The movie wants to be epic full of visual effects and a personal tragedy at the same time and it doesn't work out! So, I don't want to disappoint all the people who want to go and see this movie, but please take into account that it could just maybe turn out badly...",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

See Hughes and Brewster's dinner scene as a good example of tedious exchange of words.the absurd idea that Beckinsale could in any way be a good choice for Ava Gardner.

A stunning combination of madness and genius,"That Howard Hughes certainly was a particular individual: billionaire, filmmaker, engineer, aviator (as the title reminds us), ladies'man, but also an eccentric sociopath who wouldn't even open a door if someone else had touched it first. Not a bad subject for a movie, and Martin Scorsese decided to accept that challenge. And frankly, why not? This film was an excuse to bring Hollywood's glory years back, those years the director is so fond of, the period in which most of The Aviator is set. And let's not forget one of the movie's key themes, obsession, something Scorsese knows quite well (it took him almost 20 years to make The Last Temptation of Christ and 30 to do Gangs of New York).The first half of the film is the best one, as we witness Hughes'(Leonardo Di Caprio) first important battle: the one he fought to complete Hell's Angels, which was the most expensive picture of its time. When he's not shooting said war flick, he spends his time as any other wealthy guy: dating movie stars. The focus is on his relationship with Katharine Hepburn (a picture-perfect Cate Blanchett), although we're also granted glimpses of his affairs with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani). Through these acquaintances, we even get to see a different side of show business, namely what famous actors do off camera (Jude Law is tremendously fun as a drunk, all but heroic Errol Flynn).After that, serious trouble begins: Hughes' various manias start to increase and get worse, making him more and more alone, with nothing but his money and his extreme ambitions to keep him company (that's probably why The Aviator is called ""Scorsese's Citizen Kane""). And he's gonna need that money, since his airline might get thrown out of business, courtesy of a group of people led by Pan Am boss Juan Trippe (an impressive Alec Baldwin) and a corrupt US senator (the justly Oscar-nominated Alan Alda).Ultimately, it's a film about power and the war fought to keep that power, as well as the struggles we have to face in order to make our dreams come true. And in Leo Di Caprio, Scorsese has found a man capable of successfully portray the incarnation of innocence, enthusiasm, genius and pure madness, all in the same person. While in Gangs of New York he was second to Daniel Day-Lewis, this time the former Titanic star has the chance to shine on his own, and impress us he does, particularly when his eccentric billionaire starts losing it completely. Shame the two didn't venture more into what drew the crazy man, but The Aviator nonetheless remains a compelling, epic story.Love classic American movies? You'll love this one, too.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautifully told and with a great story  pardon the pun, but three hours flew by","Having inherited his fortune from a tooling business, Howard Hughes seems intent in ploughing into his first film, constantly reshooting and reediting it, leaving the money worries to his business manager Noah Dietrich. His passion for flying leads him to invest heavily in his own domestic airline, TWA, while also making motion pictures and having relationships with some of the most beautiful women (and girls) in Hollywood at the time. Despite suffering from an obsessive compulsion regarding cleanliness, Howard seems to be on top of the world, but attempts to steal a section of the trans-Atlantic business away from Pan-Am proves to be a risky venture, following several failed wartime projects, leading to a high stakes battle.I must be honest and say that, although I watch a lot of movies I don't really care about the real life gossip behind the scenes and hence some elements of this film were news to me; details mainly, but even then I must admit that I knew very little about Howard Hughes outside of the fact that I had seen his name of many films down the years. Certainly I knew comparatively little about his airlines and his personal traits. For this reason I watched the film with some interest but also a pinch of salt as I was aware that these film rarely tell the whole truth. Ignoring this latter concern, I found myself swept along by a great story and a great film and, when it ended some three hours after I sat down, I looked at my watch wondering where the time had gone! The fact that Hughes himself is a very interesting character only helps a script that crams the film full of so much of interest that it is hard not to be caught up in it. At times it labours some points and at other times it will not focus on areas you would like it to, but it still works. I felt the obsessive compulsive thing was lingered on too much once or twice and some scenes featuring it could have been cut down a little bit, but they didn't slow the film much if at all, so it is more opinion that flaw picking. Also, as a fan of the cinema, I expected more of his films to be mentioned but I guess in fairness these are less interesting that his real work. On top of the story, the script is actually exciting and funny as well as being human and involving  a great combination and one reason the hours just went so fast.I have not seen Gangs of NY yet, so cannot say if this is Scorsese returning to form, but it is certainly a very strong piece of direction that screams class and is very much his work. Complicated shots, one take tracking shots across crowded rooms and so on, all make the film look great without seeming overly flashy. I'm not sure if he has used special effects (as in computer graphics) before, but Scorsese seemed very at home with the cgi shots of planes etc used  some may not have been 100% convincing but it's as close as dammit. Unusually for him, the one place he did fall down was with the use of music as I found the choices to be pretty obvious and a bit repetitive; happily it took little away from the film but it is surprising for a man who wallpapers his films with music well when he wants to. The sense of time and place is spot on, mainly due to great costumes, sets and a real attention to detail running through the whole film.The cast add to the feeling that this is a quality production, although at times they are a distraction. First off, DiCaprio is great  and I never thought I'd be allowed to say that again. The guy who showed so much talent early on before appearing to give it up to soulless projects is convincing here in many ways; whether suffering with a drive he can't overcome, being on top of his game or just being funny, DiCaprio does it well. Of course he struggles with the fact that he never ages (making it hard to see the passage of time in the film) and that he looks 16 anyway, but he tries his hardest to make us forget this and, for the most part, he does it. Aside from him, the rest of the cast are best seen as support or cameos and generally they are very good. With real, famous characters it is always a risk that actors will give impressions rather than performances but the likes of Blanchett and Beckinsdale are better than that and do both equally well. Reilly is good as always, Baldwin is enjoyable and it is always a pleasure to see Alan Alda, who happens to be great here. The only problem with the cast having so many stars in it is that they are occasionally distracting  for example Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm and Brent Spiner all have little to do other than providing a ""hey look it's "" factor.Overall though it is a very impressive film and one that is enjoyable to watch even if you start the film with very little knowledge of Howard Hughes (something that modern multiplex audiences will do). The script is interesting, exciting and funny by turns and the direction is stylish without being overly flashy. The cast are all good despite a few of them being more distracting than value-adding.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Um, Martin?","First, let's talk about what's great about this film. First, there's the cinematography, which is nothing short of stunning.

Then, there's the no-more-Oscar-nominations-please-we-have-a-winner performance of Cate Blanchett, who absorbs the role of Katharine Hepburn. Cate manages to portray Kate as bold, self-assured, biting, and vulnerable all at once, and you may not believe this is the same woman who has played both Elizabeth and Galadriel.Then, we need to talk about what's good about this movie, which is most of other actor/actress in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio manages to be both charming and frightening, and Alec Baldwin has mastered the art of playing the well-mannered sleaze-bag.Finally, we need to talk about what's wrong with the movie: where and how it ends. Without giving too much away, let me just say that when the credits started rolling, they came at a very awkward point and left far too many questions unanswered.

"Not bad, but...","I didn't find this film to be anything more than a solid piece of work, definitely not one of the great movies of our time.Scorsese just can't seem to get it right any more! After the total catastrophe with ""Gangs of New York"" he now tries again with Di Caprio in The Aviator. One major flaw in this film in my opinion is the casting of Di Caprio for the role of H.Hughes. He just isn't right for the part, which cannot be said for Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale both of whom do a great job impersonating respectively K.Hepburn and A.Gardner.The second and to me most important flaw is in the script. The characters are not well developed and the storyline is somehow discontinuous. As a result, we never really understand who Howard Hughes really was, what he felt, what the relationship between him and the women in his life really was, and ultimately as a consequence, we cannot feel for him. To be great, a movie has to generate some kind of emotional response in the viewer, and this one doesn't, it leaves us cold. It would have been different if the film had spent much more time in showing Hughes' feelings, his doubts, his financial troubles and how he risked to overcome them. Instead, in the film it seems that he was just an eccentric genius who had some great ideas and who needed only to order his people to ""fix it"" in order to have them realized. Nobody's life is that simple, and I cannot imagine Hughe's was either.In other, camera and special effects where rather good and not exaggerated, the sound average. The overall large amount of Oscars and Nominations the film received is in my opinion, undeserved. All in all, The Aviator is a mediocre to good, but not great, filmed biography that will probably soon be forgotten.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of Scorsese's best-should have won Best Picture,"A fantastic epic following the unrestrained genius of a man who eventually slips into madness. It is remarkable that Howard Hughes is not more of a cultural icon having run a booming company, produced and directed acclaimed movies, designed planes, broken speed and distance records, and battled a senate committee (which was filmed in a fashion that is comparable to any of the great boxing ring bouts).DiCaprio just gets better with each movie superbly playing a character that can mix it with the best business minds of the time yet has trouble finding his way out of a toilet. John C. Reilly provides another rock-solid support role.This film also gives us a colourful glamorous insight into the stars of that era with Cate Blanchet, Kate Beckinsale, and Jude Law using their considerable talents to do their take on the black and white icons of the time.This is an inspiring movie for anyone that has faced a major life challenge and a beacon for those that have confronted dozens.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Auto Pilot,"Continuing the run of Biopics that dominated the 2005 Oscars, ""The Aviator"" tells the life story of Howard Hughes from film producer, to Hollywood playboy, to aviator entrepreneur, to recluse.Given the many and various things that Howard Hughes attempted in his life, the movie feels to me like it's skimming over his story somewhat. I think it would have been better suited to take a deeper dive on one or two key aspects, rather than trying to cover it all. It makes some of it feel a bit disjointed, for example, Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) comes and goes from his life without much explanation of how they connected, or reconnected following a violent breakup. There's little information provided about how things really turned out, his film for example, ""Hell's Angels"" is given a sceptical standing ovation at the Premier, but we're never provided any information on how the film turned out.Whilst I'm stuck on the negatives (and I know I'm criticising a legend here) I don't think some of the choices for shots are great. There are occasional hyper kinetic pan shots that I had to look away from to stop from feeling queasy. There are also some horrible overlays in establishing shots of locations and occasionally the effects haven't held up very well (although that's not the case in every scene).Which is not the say that the film is terrible, or bad even. Performances are great, across the board. It's a very mannered performance but Cate Blanchett is worthy of her best supporting Oscar for her performance as Katherine Hepburn. John C Reilly and Matt Ross are also good. There are a myriad of little performances, sometimes only in one scene, from the likes of Jude Law, Willem Defoe and Danny Huston that add to the quality of the production. But it's Leonardo DiCaprio's film. He's in virtually every scene and his performance was definitely good value for the nomination, though I'd agree it's not better than Jamie Foxx in ""Ray"".Never dull despite its running time, ""The Aviator"" is tremendous from a performance viewpoint, though a little shallow, making it solid but not essential.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The movie was beautifully directed by the legend Martin Scorsese. Subtle details like the use of lights, flashes etc to highlight eccentric nature of the main character were phenomenal.

It just kept missing the mark -- especially in casting the lead -- though good acting and cinematography,"Oh gosh. What can I say about this film? Will try to list my comments in order of importance as they seem to me: First, I'm sorry, because I really like DiCaprio. I do. But he just isn't right for this part. Why did they cast him in this? This ruined the film for me because there is just something about DiCaprio -- especially with his baby-face-like physicality -- that just could never ever ""scream"" Howard Hughes to me. The best way to ruin a film for me is to cast someone so wrong for the part that I can never forget throughout the entire movie, that I am watching an ACTOR. In this case, that was 3 hours of noticing I was watching acting. I couldn't help it. He was just so NOT Howard Hughes. I think the very hardest thing to cast is a role for a biopic of a non-fictional and well-known person. It's tough. When it's good it's great, and when it's not, it's just plain aggravating for the viewer. Don't get me wrong. I think DiCaprio did a fine job of acting. He was just miscast in this role. I could have bought Willem Dafoe more than DiCaprio -- and that's just pulling a name out of the top of my hat! The cinematography was excellent. There were many good actors, and a number of my favorites, in this film. And sometimes the story is interesting despite the aggravations. I liked what I learned new about Hughes, and now I want to read more about him. I know I'll get a better sense from books though!

Brilliant and Eccentric,"I was expecting a long conventional biopic and much to my surprise this picture turned out more eccentric and interesting than I thought it would. The SFX were understated and perfect, particularly the brilliant use of large-scale remote controlled model aircraft instead of cheesy-looking CGI. I kept guessing why the color palettes shifted so wildly and inexplicably (the movies doesn't really kick into full color until we are introduced to the celestial lair of Hughes' arch-rival Juan Trippe.) The cast is eccentric and spot-on. Everyone noted Blanchett's turn as Hepburn, but the rest of the cast rises to the occasion; Adam Scott is especially fun as Hughe's pencil-mustachioed, fast-talking publicist. There's the odd mix of dangerous and jolly fun from ""Goodfellas"" here in the progressions of Hughes' philanderings and worsening mental illness, and the movie builds steadily to its climax.

A biography as ambitious as the man himself,"Martin Scorsese's second collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio is ""The Aviator,"" a nearly three-hour biopic examining about a thirty-year window in the life of airline and movie mogul Howard Hughes, whose successes in aviation and Hollywood romances made him shine in the public eye despite the bankrupting methods and slowly growing obsessive compulsions that tore at his private life.Despite the length, Scorsese uses his brilliant talents to show how compulsion began to eat away at Hughes. To be honest, Hughes' story is nothing unbelievable or inspirational. When one decides to do a biopic, it's normally because the figure is compelling in a way audiences have never seen -- but that's not Hughes. His story is not so much what he did but the manner in which he did it, so Scorsese deserves a lot of the credit for keeping ""Aviator"" a compelling biography.Scorsese brings what could constitute as horror movie technique to illustrate Hughes' OCD. For one thing, OCD is not a vocal part of this film. It's never mentioned aloud except when a few characters describe Hughes as ""eccentric."" Scorsese is solely responsible for our understanding of Hughes' condition. The way hands are shown moving slowly and elegantly in the film, the way Scorsese holds on a close-up of red meat -- we get what's going on in Hughes' head.The blast of light from old-time flashbulbs and the crunching of glass, the way different characters' start to speak over each other -- we easily identify with Hughes' discomfort. Some help from Robert Richardson's stunning color palettes and unusual but striking lighting effects certainly helped.On the other side of the coin, the ""continue to spend money to be ahead of the curve"" slogan motivating Hughes' inventing beginning with making ""Hell's Angels"" the most expensive movie ever made (at the time) highlights the difference between him and ourselves. Nobody logically would have dared to do the things Hughes did, but he had the money and the drive to do it, constantly forcing his business manager (John C. Reilly, in the movie's first scene) to take care of the technicalities and to make it work regardless of what it took. The fact that Hughes kept going despite OCD and making debilitating choices is what makes him a great biographical figure.Parts of ""Aviator,"" while a big part of his life, don't seem to add to this core vision Scorsese and writer John Logan (""Gladiator,"" ""The Last Samurai"") paints of who Hughes was. His playboy persona adds another mysterious dimension to his character, but as great as Cate Blanchett (Katherine Hepburn) and Kate Beckinsale (Ava Gardner) are in this film, their subplots don't fit as well considering how much else is going on. In summary, Hughes needed them as maternal figures in a way, but couldn't offer them anything substantial as far as love and affection. As interesting as that is to note, notice that it doesn't exactly influence Hughes' ceaseless drive to make the best planes in the world.As Alan Alda's character Sen. Brewster enters the picture and attacks the image of Hughes that we grew accustomed to in the first chunk of the film, calling him a criminal for using military tax dollars and never having anything to show for it, we start to see Hughes' legacy. One could call Hughes a number of things, but not a liar or a crook. His flaws were in his ambition, not his core self. In 170 minutes he never once smokes a cigarette or drinks liquor -- you won't find that from a protagonist in a 1920-1947 period biopic in any other film. Coincidentally, the ambition of this film to fire off that message for its entire duration is its only real fault. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Epic craziness.,"Crafting a biopic about Howard Hughes is like running downhill - no more interesting and complex personage graced the 20th century and perhaps with the exception of Ben Franklin and maybe Abraham Lincoln maybe all of United States history. The challenge Martin Scorsese faced involved mostly keeping the fascinating stories about Hughes to just the film's 170 minute running time. Scorsese holds the movie to under 3 hours by focusing only on Hughes' establishment of TWA and Hughes Aircraft and his film production career. Although this period probably covers the most cinematic of Hughes' adventures it does miss his rise to become the biggest employer in Nevada, stints living in London, South America and finally the Caribbean. It also only covers just the early days of his madness which progresses to a far more debilitating stage later in his life. Leonard DiCaprio delves into this madness and the Hughes' genius delivering a convincing and compelling role. He never quite loses himself in the role in the way Charlize Theron could no longer be discerned in her performance as serial killer Aileen Wuornos - we always see DiCaprio behind the character. DiCaprio appears in nearly every shot but he receives the support of some excellent casting choices including Cate Blanchett , who took home an Oscar for the performance and the highly underutilized Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda and John C. Reilly. The editing of their work under can be choppy at times particularly in the beginning where titles describing the action and timeframe become necessary to keep things straight. However, once the film settles into more linear storytelling and its focus on Hughes' romance of Katharine Hepburn the nearly three hour run time moves as smoothly and quickly as one of Hughes' more successful aircraft designs. In short, the excellence of ""The Aviator"" and the genius and psychosis of its subject invite a sequel from Scorsese.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sometimes Mr Scorses is just too in awe of other 'name' directors. A homage to Citizen Kane.,"I was a little disappointed by this very long film, although Mr Scorsese's more recent work isn't great.Firstly I think Leo Dicaprio is miscast, terribly miscast as HH. He (HH) was well-known to be a tall dark-haired man and DiCaprios makes no effort to shed his 'boy band' looks here, which makes the film unbelievable from the start. DiCaprio is generally unconvincing and out of his depth here.Some of the other casting is questionable, it takes a while to get used to Cate Blanchett doing Kate Hepburn, it's too hard to forget it's Cate Blanchett, but she does well enough in the role, after a while...it can easily descend into 'camp' this type of role, so it's a relief that she manages to avoid that. Generally the best dialogue is between these two characters.I think Scorcese was too in awe and too conscious of ""Citizen Kane"" in making this film and it often seems like a weaker version or a homage to that picture.The actually building of an aviation empire is interesting, as is the 'war' between rival moguls and their tame politicians but this is also the stuff that makes it a Citizen Kane clone-pic.I think HH was a phenomenally interesting subject and the film doesn't do him justice.It's just an 'ok' film.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"HH did amazing things, but why?","I was not very familiar with Howard Hughes. I knew he had made a few movies (never saw any of them, though) and built planes that never flew, but mainly I thought of him as the eccentric recluse of his later years. Now this film shows a totally different character, a man with a vision. And what a vision! HH could so easily have become another spoiled rich kid, bedding starlets, getting drunk and doped up and dying never having done anything besides spending millions seeking vain private pleasures. Instead, the film shows us a frantic movie maker, giving it all for his art, and an even more frantic aviator and airplane builder, to whom a few million dollars are insignificant when they are needed to make his dreams come true. Of course, it's easy to be a big spender when you are swimming in money, and I couldn't see any sign of HH having any social conscience in an era where so many of his countrymen were starving, but at least he used his fortune to create things he believed in. Grandiose things, crazy, fascinating things. But why did he do it? The film never tells us what made HH do all those things he did. First we see him as a kid being washed by his mother, which is probably supposed to explain his future phobia, but then we see him in the middle of shooting Hell's angels and next as a daredevil aviator. How did he get there? Why did he become such an obsessed movie maker (it made me think of Orson Welles, equally obsessed but without the money to follow through on his grand schemes)? And why did he want so much to build the perfect plane? The film could easily have addressed these questions. It certainly was long enough. Unnecessarily so in a number of scenes, I find (although I wouldn't have minded if some other, brilliantly shot scenes would have been longer). By cutting more rigorously, much more could have been covered in those 3 hours.Enough has already been said about the very good acting. Still, I like to complement Leonardo DiCaprio on his transformation from the young jeune premier to the mature businessman appearing before the committee. He is much more convincing than James Dean attempting the same transformation (and also sporting a mustache when older) in Giant. Unfortunately, I was less thrilled by his naked lunatic scenes, which were mainly embarrassing to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hughes at His Peak But Epic Biopic Not Quite a Masterpiece,"This is an audacious, surprisingly amusing piece of Hollywood film-making by a veteran craftsman of the first magnitude, yet for a number of reasons, not necessarily of Martin Scorsese's sole doing, the movie does not resonate as much as you wish it would. In staying true to the spirit of multimillionaire magnate Howard Hughes between the late 1920's and the late 40's, Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan are stuck with the facts as they happened, and consequently, the film feels episodic with a great, sometimes dazzling story in the first 2/3 of its epic 166-minute running time and a pedantic, only occasionally involving last hour.You need to have some familiarity with Hughes' life to understand his halcyon years proving himself as a Hollywood tycoon worthy of respect, and his legendary excess during the three-year production of the now-forgotten ""Hell's Angels"" is captured perfectly here with truly thrilling aviation sequences. Scorsese then focuses on Hughes' romance with Katharine Hepburn and captures the oddball chemistry of burgeoning eccentrics amid the frenzied environment of studio-owned Hollywood, in particular, the Cocoanut Grove nightclub. These sequences remind me a lot of Scorsese's failed musical, ""New York, New York"", but this time he seems far more assured. Ava Gardner enters the picture in the forties, as Hughes builds luxury airplanes that can't fly and his obsessions and paranoia start to take over. There's a magnificently filmed sequence of Hughes crashing his XF-11 plane in the middle of Beverly Hills.Once he recovers from this incident, the film starts to drag, as the story shifts focus to the power struggles in positioning Hughes' airline TWA against the European-route monopoly of Pan Am and the machinations of Pan Am CEO Juan Trippe and the corrupt Maine senator Owen Brewster who investigates Hughes' WWII government contracts. Even the legendary mini-flight of the Spruce Goose fails to excite this late in the story. Only Scorsese's famous ""Taxi Driver""-like, mind-bending touch brings off the surrealism of the sequences where Hughes locks himself up in his room. The film ends rather anticlimactically with Hughes' successful 1947 appearance before Brewster's committee before he drowns in his obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).Leonardo DiCaprio's chief asset as an actor is his intensity of purpose, and as Hughes, he has plenty of opportunities to display this attribute with his character's obsessions with aviation, movie-making, glamorous movie stars and ultimately germs. What he is missing is a level of gravitas that would have made his character's increasing eccentricities more bearable to watch. Even though the reed-thin Texas-tinged voice is accurate, there is something perpetually juvenile about DiCaprio's appearance regardless of the twenty-year span of the story. This unfortunately compromises the chemistry between him and the obviously more mature Cate Blanchett, who initially seems to be crossing the border into parody as Hepburn. She displays the familiar brusque manner without caution and even affects the recognizable voice but with an inaccurate throatiness that belies the legendary actress' high, fluttery pitch at the time. Nevertheless, she eventually finds her grounding, especially as she recognizes their too-similar personalities and softens during the Hepburn family gathering scene.With less to do, the too-patrician Kate Beckinsale is in over her head as Ava Gardner, unable to convey the real actress' palpable sultriness or predatory voraciousness without posturing. On the other hand, Alec Baldwin is becoming a stronger character actor with every new film, and he plays Trippe with disquieting authority. John C. Reilly plays assistant Noah Dietrich in his typically hangdog fashion as he subsists more in the shadows. Alan Alda plays Brewster with Hawkeye's familiar mannerisms unafraid to show the underlying sliminess of his character. All the externals are impressive - Thelma Schoonmaker's sharp editing (the pacing never drags...just the story), Robert Richardson's cinematography, Dante Ferretti's production design, Sandy Powell's costumes. Yet for all of this, the movie falls short as a masterwork in Scorsese's filmography. This is a film to respect and not to love.The first disc has an excellent commentary track by Scorsese, Schoonover and producer Michael Mann - all full of insights without being pedantic. The number of extras on the second disc of the two-DVD set is staggering, really too much for anyone except for those deeply interested in Hughes. There is one deleted scene and twelve separate featurettes and documentaries covering everything from the production to Hughes' role in aviation to OCD to the music. Beyond the sheer number, my complaint about the set is that it's hard to maneuver around the decidedly viewer-unfriendly menus.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Biopic for those who don't know Hughes' story ends up just OK,"Howard Hughes had a pretty crazy life. That's what I could sum up this biopic as trying to say. There was no reason to release this film at this time, but Scorsese did a pretty decent job, and therefore, the directing saved this pretty anti-climactic story There were hardly any resolutions when Hughes, played very consistently by Leonardo DiCaprio, would see a problem with his insanities throughout life, which made his story seem less and less likely to end up great. In fact, a lot of friends I know thought this was suppose to show the genius behind him, but in actuality, the film seems to make him more like an OCD sufferer and man who cheats death throughout his life rather than any kind of public-figure-turned-hero/genius.All of the acting was done very well. I got tired of seeing Cate Blanchett's ""Katherine Hepburn,"" but I guess I should blame Scorsese for allowing that over-the-top delivery over and over again. Gwen Stefani played Jean Harlow, who seems to never say much other than kissing some Hughes butt publicly (at least that's what you think whenever you see her role in The Aviator). Hughes, being a man of the ladies of Hollywood, knew and dated many a celebrity back in his time, and this film got that fact across, and he probably would've continued had his drive to work more than love taken over.The film completely overlooks his death and some other points of his life, but again, Scorsese sums up a good amount of it. The film was a bit long (about a man whom some have never heard of before) to get it point across, but it was nice to hear that some of past's moguls were not so boring and that they had their problems, too.I don't know if I'd see it again, but it was a great summing up of Hughes' life. I gave it a 7/10 because it had a pretty typical story of a man's rise and fall throughout life, but it was nice to see the many facets of humanity that were realized before Hughes' eyes when he was at the height of his career. A good rent, when it comes out, but I wouldn't buy.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Magnificent.,"Howard Hughes was an iron and steel industry tycoon, a reckless pilot, he owned an airlines, he was a cinema producer, a playboy A man who live a hundred lives in just one, who defeated death itself after a brutal plane crash... A man that ended up devoured by his own personal demons, his neurosis and his phobias. They turned him into a hermit, locked up in a motel room. A great story to be adapted to the big screen... And who would adapt it better than Martin Scorsese (maybe the best director alive)? I think the first difficulty to avoid was the election of the main actor. I mean, if you choose the wrong guy then the whole project will crumble. Di Caprio, he's a hell of an actor, he's so good, but he still looks like a teenager. Anyway, that's something that all the actors of his generation have in common, so let's just say it is a lesser evil. He carries with the whole weight of the movie and that's a big pressure he just overcame. The rest of the cast is so good as well, specially Cate Blanchett who beautifully plays Katharine Hepburn. The only one who looks out of place is Kate Beckinsale (that poor little thing playing goddess Gardner?? Come On!!).A magnificent movie, so ambitious, that honour the legend of Howard Hughes and his megalomania. A good script that perfectly set out the ""hows"" and the ""whys"" of Hughes' descent into hell. Maybe it would've been interesting to stress the years that Hughes stayed confined... but it's OK as it is, 'cause Hughes was much more than a neurotic.*My rate: 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Howard Hughes, flawed genius.","Superb movie! It deals with Hughes' early adult years, from his 20s through his mid 40s, when he left Houston and invaded Hollywood and Washington, forcing lasting advances in movie-making and flight, and calling the bluff of devious politicians. By any measure Howard Hughes was a genius, always thinking ahead, bigger, better, higher. Nothing was impossible, as long as you had enough money and enough people working for you. He never hesitated to risk going broke when he believed in a project. Suffering from mental disorders now known as ""obssessive/compulsive"" , as it got worse Hughes spent much of his old age as a recluse. But his ideas and those of scientists he hired have changed aviation, space exploration, electronics, communications, and even movie-making. The 2-set DVD has a number of interesting ""extras"" which show how wide Hughes' impact was.Leonardo DiCaprio is Howard Hughes, and delivers an award-quality performance. Always dependable Cate Blanchett is equally good as Katharine Hepburn, very closely capturing the unique cadence and sound of her voice. Other stars include beautiful Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, head of rival Pan Am Airlines. Alan Alda as the shady Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow and Jude Law as Errol Flynn.The opening scene shows a young boy of about 10 or 11 standing nude in a tub of water, his mother bathing him while she says and spells ""quarantine"", while warning young Howard about the dangers of various diseases. This we assume was the seed planted by his mother which, germinating and growing in his adult mind, was responsible for Hughes' mental illness. When both dad and mom were dead while Howard was barely in his 20s, he took the Hughes Tool (oil drilling bits) fortune to Hollywood and satisfied both of his interests, making ""Hells Angels"" about fliers in WW I.The movie does not try to cover all of Hughes' life, but touches on significant events of a 20-something year period. Desiging and flying a plane that broke speed records. A record flight around the world. Near-death crashes. Failed military contracts, including the Spruce Goose. Romancing the stars. His growing phobias. A landmark film.",,Anonymous,Biography
Something's missing,"With a record of deep and troubled portraits: Travis Bickle and Jake la Motta, Scorsese has all the ability, and more, to deliver on a strong level about Hughes. But somehow it doesn't.On the good side there is the slick and rich production, the moving camera (adapting FW Murnau), the design, the flight sequences are extraordinary, even if a little too CGI, but still exciting. The romance with Hepburn is intriguing but it goes nowhere and doesn't say much about Hughes at all. Blanchett really takes this movie over in her performance.On the negative side, when the Hepburn story is over the movie drops in intensity. Hughes is a weird and ill man and unlike Scorsese's other damaged properties, the illness just removes any possible connection. Sure, as Pauline Kael said, ""Raging Bull"" was about pond life, but it had an eloquent story about America for that group of people. Here the overt illness and script are more like a boys own adventure gone wrong but it does not connect to the wider themes that Scorsese was probably targeting, as he has in other movies. At the end the resonance is not there as it was with Travis Bickle: Hughes is not like the viewer with his OCD.But more difficult is the casting of DiCaprio, where he is a capable actor but his face is wrong: it's too sweet, it's too young. It's not fair, because he does a good job but it still doesn't fit the movie but DiCaprio is a key reason why it falters. Billy Wilder said casting is everything and here that maxim is true. Movies rely on faces and close ups and how audiences respond to faces, and with movie stars, the baggage they bring, how the audience feels about them and the roles they take is crucial to acceptance. In this respect DiCaprio should have passed on the role.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Europeans, beware of the good rating!","I made the mistake to read only American reviews before seeing the movie. I would have avoided the film. European reviews draw a different picture of it. The reason is simple: The movie assumes a lot of knowledge about the subject and American zeitgeist. You need to catch some keywords and names, and you need to recognise their meaning and produce the associated American emotions. If you cannot you will see a long and confusing film. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying the movie is bad. I am just saying non-Americans have a harder time understanding and thus enjoying it. However, if you want to get a glimpse of how the entrepreneurial spirit of our brothers and sisters on the other side of the Atlantic has evolved this film might be for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""A bad experience with a dog""","The biographical movie is these days more able than ever to be frank about all kinds of madness and sordidness. In fact it's more than that. It's practically a prerequisite of the modern biopic that you present your subject as some kind of flawed genius. The trouble is, no matter how interesting the individual, an interesting movie is not a guarantee.The Aviator is directed by Martin Scorsese, whose love of antique cinema surely gave him some special interest in the project. However, I don't see what the idea was of making the early scenes mimic Howard Hughes's two-strip colour process. It doesn't have the authenticity to hark back to the real thing, no other lost classic techniques are resurrected to keep it company, and frankly it looks ugly. As usual Scorsese's showy, jumpy manner of filmmaking is a bit hit-and-miss. He's still great at capturing states of mind, albeit a bit heavy-handedly, but he is seriously short on ""wow"" moments these days.The protagonist is portrayed by Scorcese's new favourite Leonardo DiCaprio. He's perfect as the young Hughes because he'll probably go on looking eighteen until he's fifty. Trouble is he still looks (and sounds) eighteen when he's playing the middle-aged Hughes. The acting however is first class, subtle yet forceful. The same unfortunately cannot be said of Cate Blanchett's terrible impersonation of Katherine Hepburn, which copies a few of Hepburn's speech patterns in a grotesque caricature. And she gets the accent wrong. No-one else really stands out as good or bad.In spite of the general mediocrity of the production, Hughes's life as presented here does offer up some great moments. A nice little montage of clips from Hell's Angels which makes it look even better than it probably is in reality. The occasional humour in an incredibly rich man who thinks he can get anything to happen by simply buying the experts. Our ability to actually route for Hughes when he comes back blazing and cleans up at the hearing after everyone had written him off as a nutter. The eventual poignancy as his condition resurfaces. However it's The Aviator's failure to weave this into some kind of grand narrative that makes it seem so plain overall.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The 'special effects' were noteworthy for being totally unrealistic and the acting was non-existent in most cases. Alan Alda was the only adult in a featured role with all the rest of the older cast portrayed by a very youthful cast.

"Bravo Mr. DiCaprio, Mr. Hughes, The Entire Cast and Story, Bravo!!","This is the movie changed my mind about DiCaprio - he is positively brilliant as Howard Hughes a man whom I've always held in the highest regard. Having said that makes me also focus on the films one flaw. the compulsion to portray the exceptional as eccentric or flawed psychologically. At the beginning of the 20th Century we much admired the brilliant and extraordinarily productive; now the trend - indoctrinated by the NEA schools and academia - is to find them abnormal and praise, instead, conformity. All part of Dewey's plan for education to create a docile compliant citizenry. How VERY wrong that is.

Baby Faced Leo  Flies High,"The focus of attention naturally is on Leo DiCaprio but Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn steals the picture.

Even with a moustache, he looks like Hughes's son with a moustache. Even when Leo grows mean,ugly and disturbed in Hughes's later years, he still looks like a warped kid. Indeed, Leo is a very gifted actor but throughout the entire film he reminded me of Jack in ""Titanic."" Oh well, maybe I have a one track mind? The special effects are STUNNING. The color is STUNNING. The story is fascinating. It's going to cop many Oscars and maybe even one for the longest picture of the year however, although I can't pinpoint it,the film lacked that certain something to classify it as monumental.

Overrated...though that doesn't mean it's bad,"I personally clapped when Million Dollar Baby (a masterpiece) defeated the favorite (this movie) at the 77th Oscars. First of all, Scorsese's film is extremely long. After the first two hours you start to become bored and tired and lose interest in the movie. The film tries to cover too many aspects of the life of Howard Hughes.Definitely the best thing about The Aviator are the performances. DiCaprio has been equally loved and hated with this performance. Yes, he overacts in 70% of the film, but he is playing Howard Hughes, an overacting man himself. Alda also gives us a magnificent and sober performance as the Sentaor that tries to ""defeat"" Hughes. But definitely Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn steals the movie. She is simply MAGNIFICENT in her role as one of the greatest actress ever.Something else that truly saves the movie is the whole production design. It is simply perfect. The cinematography and art direction are very good.Now, on to the disapproving bit. The screenplay makes us enter Hughes's mind so deeply that not even in the three hours of film you are able to exit it throughly and close the doors that the film opens. This doesn't have anything to do with the ""open ending"" the film has which is not entirely accurate.This film reminds me of ""A Beautiful Mind"", not only because it is a biopic of an schizophrenic genius but because they are both highly overrated. This doesn't mean any of the two films are bad, just that they didn't fulfill the expectations both critics and audience had.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Scorsese Illuminates Hughes' Enigma, Dicaprio Grows...","This 2004 Howard Hughes biopic stands out amongst the best biographical pictures of the last 10 years. Although not as gritty and intense as Scorsese's greatest film ""Raging Bull"" (1980), this picture is well-crafted and sleek. The life and times of the enigmatic Howard Hughes make for compelling subject matter and Socorsese's effort does not disappoint.Those of us Scorsese fans that look upon his work as commercially defiant, and nuanced towards sophisticated viewers have witnessed a gradual, relentless modifying of his technique toward a wider demographic. This evolution of Scorcese's once radical film-making style towards a more commercial, big budget approach is natural and expected given the increasing commercial success of each successive Scorsese film, (not to mention major studio desire to release the next potential Scorsese classic i.e. ""GoodFellas""). These changes in style and presentation are also closely linked to the diverse screenplays and proliferation of new A-list talent (such as Mr. DiCaprio) headlining Scorsese's pictures. Given these considerations, ""The Aviator"" still manages to showcase quite a few original Scorsese sequences recalling his raw and intensely personal early films.Howard Hughes was a filmmaker as well as an aviator and it's no surprise that the chaotic production of Hughes first film ,1930's ""Hell's Angels"" (which Scorsese clearly admires) is chronicled in detail at the outset of the movie. We witness the continuous nervous energy and persistent drive of Hughes to achieve his daring goals, all the while breaking new ground in aviation, film and big business. This film closely tracks Hughes' personal life as well, his well-publicized affairs with famous starlets of the day such as Katherine Hepburn (played well by Cate Blanchett) are illustrated in-depth with notable performances throughout.Leonardo DiCaprio continues to grow and develop under Scorsese's direction, and the development is phenomenal to witness. Beginning with ""Gangs Of New York"" (2002) and continuing beyond this movie (2006's masterful ""The Departed""), DiCaprio's acting chops are sharpening with each performance, eclipsing his previous work and establishing his talent amongst Hollywood's A-List actors. As the Hughes character, DiCaprio is able to captivate and compel us with flashes of OCD symptoms and manic behavior to the extreme, all the while struggling to balance these chaotic forces with his public and managerial personas. A fascinating example of this balancing act occurs when Hughes is confronted with a ruthless public relations attack, designed to coerce him into selling his airline TWA to his commercial competitor, Pan Am (whose chief, Juan Trippe is played by Alec Baldwin). Hughes collects his faculties and battles back with impressive vigor, this after nearly dying in a spectacular crash of his XF-11 spy plane prototype. All of these events unfold beautifully and the rhythm of this film holds our attention despite the nearly 3 hour running time.""The Aviator"" holds up well on repeat viewings despite the long running time, it covers the entire first half of Hughe's remarkable life and career, and a second feature could easily be written detailing Hughes' subsequent years in Las Vegas and his premature death. All in all, DiCaprio's growth as an actor cannot be understated, this is a must see performance.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Dicaprio is finally in his prime, Scorsese remains in his prime","Even though Leonard Dicaprion still looks like a baby, Scorsese and his last two films have helped turn him into one of today's finest young actors. Dicaprio (30 years old, I believe) brings bright eyes and baby faced excitement to the young drill bit tycoon from Texas, Howard Hughes, trying to piece together his epic, grand scaled first film ""Hell's Angels."" Just when he's got it about wrapped up, he realizes that the public is no longer interested in silent films and wants to re-shoot his film for sound. Months and millions later he gets it done. This is just the opening act of Scorse's obligatory epic, and although this surely is not Marty's best picture or most personal piece, we can see a parallel character in Hughes to that of Scorsese. Like ""Gangs of New York,"" ""Kundun,"" ""The Age of Innocence,"" and ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" Scorsese has created a world from the past that he had never seen with his own eyes but had vision enough to imagine it and imagination enough to direct his actors to exist in it. Dicaprio as his lead man in the last two Scorsese pictures is not his new Deniro but a young actor with cooperation enough to create these worlds and the dark (and light) side of human nature that exist within them. It is time this year that Scorsese is finally given his Academy Award for Achievement in direction. This film is not just an excuse to give him an award, but rather a showcase of one of America's finest filmmakers still very much in his prime.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Intriguing,"Who was Howard Hughes? Howard Hughes was Captain Queeg, both the Queeg who wound up mumbling while juggling ball bearings under cross-examination in court and the Queeg rightly praised for helping defend the country behind the scenes before World War II ever started.Howard Hughes was Elvis, lighting up the world and then slipping off his drug-addicted throne in the night.Howard Hughes was Nikola Tesla, genius extraordinaire who wound up a lunatic feeding the pigeons on the steps of the NY Public Library.Yes, Howard Hughes was a flawed genius. Who isn't flawed? I'd like to meet that person. Hughes' flaws were just bigger than some and ultimately consumed him, but he lived a heck of a life.As to this film, it also is flawed because it doesn't answer the question of who Hughes was, except to portray Hughes as cool but really, really weird. There is no rhyme or reason given for anything. Things are done because Howard Hughes wants them done. Period. An overused attempt at a ""Rosebud"" gimmick attempts to explain everything, but to me at least, explains nothing.A glaring problem to me is that there is an almost violent obsession in this film with Mr. Hughes' obsessive-compulsive disorder even though that didn't really take on its grotesque dimensions until late in his life. This film wants to paint him as Rainman at the very moment of his last and greatest triumph, the flight of the Spruce Goose. Yes, he died with long fingernails and so forth and so on. But that was almost 30 years later! And even then, he still, in his final years, was able to conduct a lucid telephone interview with reporters to discredit the famed unauthorized ""authorized"" biography. Hughes was still active in Hollywood until the late 1950s. I think that this film's attempt to paint Hughes as a freak during a time when he wasn't one yet - he was just a lovable eccentric throughout his public life - is disappointing.The best parts of the film show Howard Hughes in action, making instant decisions and pulling the aviation industry ahead with his teeth. The worst parts are the talky and often clunky melodramatic interludes, with inexplicable scenes of girlfriends ramming their cars into his and so forth. The most striking scene is Hughes pulling himself together to testify before the Senate and turning the inquisition back on the inquisitor. The aviation scenes, collectively, make the film, though.The person I saw this with asked an excellent question as we left. ""Wasn't Hughes ever married?"" That you can sit through a three-hour film on a man and not even get a hint at an answer to that basic question - in fact, you get all sorts of hints at the wrong answer to that question - is inexplicable.This film has some of the same flaws as ""Gangs of New York."" That film had some excellent scenes, then fell apart when it tried to become a documentary. This film doesn't quite fall apart, but it loses its focus when it forces in unnecessary allusions to Hughes' later problems. There is a lot of great stuff, and a lot of sloppiness to this film. I think that Scorcese is a great film-maker who needs a disciplined editor.I liked ""The Aviator."" I consider it one of the best of 2004 for a number of reasons, not least because overall it really is favorable to its subject and continues the justified rehabilitation of Howard Hughes that began with ""The Rocketeer."" Leo DiCaprio gives a fabulous performance. But the script is too indulgent, the editing too porous, the effects too showy. Why? To what end? Those are the questions that need to be answered about Mr. Hughes, and they aren't even asked in this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

There is something horribly wrong when one wishes that the hero of the movie would die in a plane crash halfway through the movie just to end the torture.Like others have said, the cinematography was brilliant and Cate Blanchett did a great job, but other than that, there isn't much to see in this. Go read a book about Howard Hughes instead. Or beat your skull against a brick wall, even. It will be far more entertaining.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Academic Definition of a Cinematic Biopic,"There is something peculiar and special about Martin Scorsese's biopics that stood way out of your average biopics. Scorsese's main focus in making a biopic is not to just pay homage to the figure he is attributing to or just laying out events after events, but he makes it into a character study. It is the same greatness he puts into Raging Bull and The Wolf of Wall Street. In this seminal work, we the audience explore the life of Howard Hughes and his battle with obsessive-compulsive disorder - a very serious mental illness. As well as shows his character's rise and fall as a billionaire as he strives in life in amidst of the struggles and challenges from his mental illness.One of the most fascinating things about this picture is the technical achievement of it, particularly the cinematography. The story behind it is Scorsese's reminiscence of watching films of the era when he was a child, and he wanted to translate that color techniques in modern filmmaking context. Phenomenal work by cinematographer Robert Richardson who successfully imitates the early American Technicolor dye-transfer process to replicate the vintage look. The cinematography is an evolving color, with two-strip and then three-strip and then modern. All of which is reflective of the period of the time it depicts. Additionally, the films' use of color alteration in every situation, emotion, production design, costumes, and make-up are all used in a very very purposeful way to transcend the depth and meaning through all that. And that is the beauty of a Martin Scorsese picture.Now one cannot praise this picture without acknowledging the two elephants in the room: the acting performances by Leo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett. This is my personal favorite Leo DiCaprio's performance for the way he just throws himself into the role with a lot of flexibility and portraying the essential emotions of Howard Hughes so intricately. Cate Blanchett is my second favorite actress ever, I never thought she could nail Katherine Hepburn's accent and mannerism like that. She truly truly pays tribute to the great Katherine Hepburn herself. Cate Blanchett has pulled off many amazing performances over the years, as Queen Elizabeth I, Katherine Hepburn, Bob Dylan. If that is not range, I'm sorry but I don't know what is.Overall, Scorsese's biopics are always more than just a documentary or an average biopic, he always ventures deep into the psychology and emotion of the character and not just events after events. Scorsese's films will be studied for years and forevermore.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hard to invest in a fella we care little for,"Care factor zero is behind the dramatic failure of Scorsese's latest, a visual essay on aspects of the life of Howard Hughes (Leonardo De Caprio).The presentation is glossy and too slick; I never felt any sense of danger in the dogfight sequence because planes were impacting with the lens and emerging on the other side. It was like watching a cartoon.Hughes, an odd fellow, developed an unhealthy obsession with cleanliness. The movie spends quite a bit of time showing him combating filthy things and imagined filthy things. After a while it got boring.Even though Hughes spent millions on projects that never flew, he never came close to going bust. His accountant got plenty peed off at him when he continued to pour dollars into his epic flop HELL'S ANGELS, but still, he never faced any visible hardship as a result. It's like I was watching an extended promo on the life of Hughes The only time the film arrested my interest was when Hughes was put on trial and went head to head with crooked politician Alan Alda. We learned something about his motivations here and enjoyed his underdog status (if only briefly).Immensely disappointing.",,Anonymous,Biography
Very interesting and historical character!,"DiCaprio and Blanchett are suburb in this biopic by Director Martin Scorsese.

"""I care very much about aviation.""","Considering he is often heralded as one of the finest directors ever to work in Hollywood, I find it rather surprising to discover that my experience with Martin Scorsese is embarrassingly limited. Outside of his all-time classics {'Taxi Driver (1976),' 'Raging Bull (1980)'}, the enjoyable 'The King of Comedy (1983)' and the interesting but uneven 'Gangs of New York (2002),' I had seen very little from the famed director. 'The Aviator (2004)' was a film about which I was very enthusiastic, as glossy biopics are a favourite sub-genre of mine, and its success at the 2005 Academy Awards {5 wins from 11 nominations} suggested that this film was a type specimen. Unfortunately, Scorsese's biopic of Howard Hughes proves a bit too ""glossy"" for its own good, though there are certainly multiple moments of brilliance amid the fast-moving 170 minutes of skyward drama. Leonardo DiCaprio, finally breaking free of that ""baby-faced"" persona that had clung to him throughout his career, is impeccable as notorious film producer, aviator and billionaire, whose mental deterioration and descent into reclusiveness is well-documented in history.'The Aviator' opens in 1927, with a young Howard Hughes directing his first ambitious motion picture, the epic war-time aviation drama, 'Hell's Angels (1930)' {a film that I'm now determined to track down}. Despite countless setbacks, and an expanding budget that stretches into the millions, Hughes is determined to complete his film, whatever the cost. It is in these opening scenes that 'The Aviator' truly hits its stride, and the remainder of the film struggles to keep up; being a director himself, Scorsese obviously delights in retelling an epic film-making tale, and some slick {if not entirely convincing} visual effects help to capture the sheer majesty of Hughe's vision  I think that it would have been even more charming for the film to have created these aerial scenes using the same tools that were available in the 1920s {however, there were obvious safety considerations, considering three pilots died during the making of 'Hell's Angels'}. The remainder of the film concerns Hughes' fascination with aviation, his company's tussle with Pan American Airlines, his various female liaisons, and his struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder.Though he is still perhaps too young to correctly portray a man reaching his forties, Leonardo DiCaprio {in his second collaboration with Scorsese} is excellent in the film's leading role, successfully capturing Hughes' eccentric personality and his OCD-afflicted symptoms. Of course, the film is arguably stolen by Cate Blanchett {in an Oscar-winning role}, who faultlessly channels the spirit of Katharine Hepburn, mimicking her well-recognised tone of voice, mannerisms and general demeanour. Kate Beckinsale {Ava Gardner}, Gwen Stefani {Jean Harlow} and Jude Law {Errol Flynn} also do their best at playing popular Hollywood figures, but these three pale in comparison with Blanchett's epic portrayal. Also memorable in 'The Aviator' are John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Ian Holm, and especially Alan Alda {of TV's ""M*A*S*H""}, who plays a senator allegedly in the pocket of Howard Hughes' greatest rival, Pan Am owner Juan Trippe.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The way of the future... the way of the future...,"I love this movie for the aviation history and advancements made by Hughes. However, I think what most moves me about this movie is the self-made power that Hughes generates. He was a man that that would not allow anyone, not even the most powerful government in the world, to push him around. He was unapologetically a capitalist American, a genius, an innovator, and a patriot who loved America. He was the dream wrapped up in a person, which is so rare. We see this once every 50 or so years in a person; Elon Musk comes to mind. This movie allows us to see the power and fragility of Hughes, one of these rare men who push America forward despite all odds; a hero.The acting is great. I loved Blanchett as Hepburn. From DiCaprio to the smaller roles, each person hit their mark and made this one of the finest movies of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Impressive biopic of a stunning individual,"Martin Scorcese's biopic of the billionaire, movie mogul, aviator and playboy Howard Hughes is a riveting, enthralling epic that successfully examines both the lifestyle and psychology of one of the twentieth century's most intriguing individuals.The Aviator details Howard Hughes' life in the twenty years between 1927-47, which includes his career as a movie producer/director, his achievements as an aeronautical designer and aviator, as well as the glamorous women he dated and the political problems he faced after World War Two. It also details his struggle with obsessive compulsive disorder and his fear of germs, which would greatly hinder him in his later life.The Aviator is aided to a large extent by the brilliant performances of it's stellar cast. Leonardo Di Caprio successfully sheds off his Titanic heart-throb image, proving that he is one of today's most talented actors with his stunning portrayal of Hughes. Di Caprio perfectly captures the eccentricity, arrogance and passion that drove Hughes to fame. But the moments that most impress in this tour de force performance are the scenes in which Hughes starts to spiral into the obsessive compulsive madness that plagued him in his later life. It is in these scenes that Di Caprio displays some of his finest acting ever. The only faults with his performance is that Di Caprio never fully captures Hughes' voice, although he does nail his intonation. And he never really physically resembles Hughes until the final scenes. However, these criticisms are merely pedantic observations, and they do not detract at all from the brilliance of his performance.But the credit can't all go to Di Caprio. Cate Blanchett is equally impressive as Katherine Hepburn. Blanchett perfectly captures the voice, mannerisms and attitude of Hepburn, and infuses her performance with such humanity and insecurity that it comes across as so much more than a simple impersonation. Blanchett rightfully won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar of 2004 for this film, and continued to prove that she is the most versatile actresses next to Meryl Streep.Scorcese shows off his awesome directing talents again, providing a glamorous yet often disturbing portrait of a tortured genius. And he proves that he is capable with more than we expected of him with the perfectly executed flight sequences. The use of period colour photography is also intriguing. This is most evident in the scene where Hughes and Hepburn play golf, and the grass appears more turquoise than green.However, the movie does fall short of perfection. One of it's main faults (in my opinion) is that it does not focus enough on the cast as an ensemble. Di Caprio and Blanchett are the only actors who are indulged enough, and I felt that more screen time should have been dedicated to the performances of Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, John C Reilly and Kate Beckinsale. To his credit, Alda makes the most of his screen time, and secured an Oscar nomination for his performance. But I would still have liked to have seen more development of the minor characters, particularly Baldwin's.The film also skips over important details of Hughe's life, including his fascist politics, which are conveniently airbrushed out of the film to portray Hughes as an all-American hero, which I feel is wrong. His politics should have been acknowledged. It is these faults that prevent The Aviator from achieving the greatness of other Scorcese films such as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver.However, if you forgive the film it's faults, and see it for what it is, you will find a brilliant, complex, heart-lifting and sometimes tragic film, which uncompromisingly examines an eccentric genius, which remains one of the best films of 2004 and one of my personal favourites. I hope it becomes one of your's too.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Leo is a downfall and so is the lack of insanity,---- i thought that H.H. was really insane--- in this film he is presented in a nice light--- and why not--- if you want the gory details get a biography on the man--- Why oh why did they pick Leo to play H.H.--- what a foolish thing to do. I can't stand him. He has a hard time playing older characters on film --- he never seems old. Granted if I was in his place I would take that as a compliment but he can't transform like Cate Blanchett. She played Katharine Hepburn like a fiddle. In fact the best parts of the movie focused on their relationship.It is hard to separate someone's incredible life from a movie depiction of it. I feel that H.H. life was far more interesting in real life (and more complex) than anything that could be put on the screen. Martin Scorsese did a great job in trimming a potentially 35 hour movie down to a palatable hunk. All in all i recommend seeing it.,,Anonymous,Biography
Biopic or testimonial?,"This Scorsese-DiCaprio epic is a visual and audible feast. All the media blitzing seems warranted from the perspective of bang for your movie bucks. The special effects are thrilling. The camera work is hypnotizing. The shots are suitably grand or movingly intimate. And, the viewer is guaranteed 170 minutes of semi-solid entertainment. I cringed at the initial sound of Cate's Kate, but I was won over very quickly. I winced at the first sight of Beckinsale's Gardner, but I was soon reassured by her delivery of Ava-speak, frank and earthy. Mr DiCaprio's representation of Hughes was less problematic, since the recluse Hughes left a relatively forgotten audio-visual legacy. Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda were really quite good. Alda's Senator Brewster rivals Charles Laughton's Senator Cooley in Preminger's ""Advise and Consent"" (1962).But, is it biopic or testimonial? And, as either or both, is the film a well constructed and coherent piece of work? The exploration of Howard Hughes' eccentricities certainly is coherently and cogently done. This is no mean feat. The man lived a relatively long and very eventful life, despite crippling personality traits. The political material late in the film did seem more testimonial than biopic. I felt I was fairly warned by the earlier scene, in which Hughes scolds the rich socialists at the Hepburn table in Connecticut. In any case, I think it fair to summarize one of the movie's underlying prejudices as ""Unrestrained capitalism is good."" It is indeed a timely message. However, I wonder if this timely viewpoint will stand the test of time and art.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Above average.,"What a credit to Hughes. Casting played their roles well. Above average in many ways. Di Caprio shines here portraying Texan wit & manner. Cate Blanchett did a convincing Hepburn. Action maintained throughout film or was it just that Hughes was just that active in his life presenting such a multitasker. Loved the chemistry portrayed between Hughes and Gardener. It could be so touching. Was his relationships that extreme? Helped the movie stay captivating. Evidently, Hughes has plenty of material for a movie. Was incredible and perplexing life. Some of his mental issues could be easily diagnosed today. The least dislike for me was the ending. Then again, maybe that was a kindly one to an ugly reality.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scorsese is on form with this exciting biopic,"The Aviator traces the life of millionaire businessman, film producer, film director, and aviator, Howard Hughes, paying particular attention to his middle years as a record-breaking aviator and movie mogul.With nearly three hours of viewing time, The Aviator has quite a lot for your money's worth. Fortunately, most of it is gripping enough to keep you fascinated to the very last frame. Scorsese seems to have documented much of Hughes life very accurately, focussing on his exciting involvement in aeroplanes and film-making, rather than the murkier world of his behind the scenes involvement in politics, and stopping before he gets too bogged down with Howard Hughes the weird recluse.With a host of stars, Leonardo DiCaprio pulls off the title role admirably, the likes of Kate Beckinsale (as Ava Gardner), John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, and Ian Holm all put in good work, and the delightful cameos of Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow and Jude Law as Errol Flynn keep things moving nicely; but the show-stealer for me was re-creation of screen legend Katharine Hepburn by Cate Blanchett, whose character comes as a vibrant breath of fresh air against a backdrop of fairly right-wing, power-seeking individuals.In The Aviator, Scorsese has found a subject who is nothing if not interesting. Howard Hughes set revolutions rippling through Hollywood, making - at the time - the most expensive movie ever produced, and his attention to detail is one that Scorsese perhaps admires and even successfully emulates. As an aviator, Hughes pioneered new engineering techniques with almost fanatical zeal, not only breaking most known airspeed records but introducing along the way countersunk rivets and retractable landing gear to reduce wind resistance and so make planes go faster. His own involvement was charismatic  he would fly the planes himself, often risking life and limb, whether to test new prototypes or, even in earlier years, to do dangerous stunts in his films. His brushes with the censors (he created the half-cup bra for his protégé Jane Russell) add further colour to what was already an over-the-top lifestyle, and the fact that he often actually succeeded, even when taking on big business or the government, prevent him from being dismissed as a mere playboy.Howard Hughes also had some sort of mental aberration, expressing itself as phobias to obsessive behaviour, but the film manages to suggest, to me at least, that his illness may even have helped him towards greatness rather than making him accept and adapt to a more normal level of achievement. But as is often the case with Scorsese, there is no underlying philosophising, no artistic flights of fancy, no deep questions asked or answered. What we do have is good story-telling, and it would perhaps be a bit mean and overcritical to say the result is a bit flat or unimaginative.As traditional Big Picture movie making goes, The Aviator is a success, and will no doubt garner many awards and delight audiences for years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Much ado about zip,"I was so looking forward to seeing a flick this year that might be worthy of Oscar. Still looking.I have read the reviews posted for Avitator. They are nearly uniformly praiseworthy of this effort. I disagree.First, Leo is not effective as Hughes. Particularly when he bursts loose with profanity. He looks absolutely childish. I literally laughed out loud each time he got angry. One reviewer noted, correctly, that the Senate hearings provide his best work as Hughes. Indeed, those scenes are, in my opinion, the only good work he does in this film.Blanchett is quite good as Hepburn. The rest of the ensemble don't register anything, as they are in the movie for such short bursts that who can know, or care, if they turned in a good piece of work.This movie disappointed me.

"Some Turbulence for ""The Aviator""","""The Aviator"" is the biopic of maverick film producer and aviator Howard Hughes as directed by Martin Scorsese. In ""The Aviator"", we follow certain events of Hughes life (those determined important by the filmmakers) episodically during a time span of roughly twenty years.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes in a solid performance. While DiCaprio does nothing extraordinary, his occasional nervous ticks and varying degrees of a furrowed brow add a nice element to the film. Cate Blanchett in a supporting role as one of Hughes' love interests Katherine Hepburn is quite impressive. Blanchett obviously put great effort into the part as characterised by her rapid, accented dialogue. Alec Baldwin (at his sleazy best), Ian Holm and Alan Alda also put in commendable acting efforts. Sadly underdeveloped are the characters portrayed by John C. Reilly and Kate Beckinsale. Reilly's character is Hughes' second in command, yet throughout the film, he only seems to take notes and complain about Hughes' spending habits. Beckinsale as Ava Gardner essentially replaces Blanchett after Hughes' romance with the latter falls apart. However, while Blanchett fared prominently, Beckinsale floats in and out of the picture.Perhaps the biggest problem with ""The Aviator"" is its plot. While most of the plot is actually quite good, there are two serious missteps. The first is in a short scene that starts the movie and is later recalled in a flashback. It tries to link Hughes' mental problems to the single event of his mother bathing him (when he is at a preteen age) while offering neurotic advice (whether this should also explain Hughes' obsession with 'mammories' and milk, I do not know). The second is the brief reappearance of characters whose use in the movie had already ended. There are several examples of this: Blanchett returns much later to see Hughes, but does not and never returns, Jude Law appears for one scene and then reappears in a 'walk on' part only and Beckinsale reappears to 'save' Hughes and then leaves.Visually, ""The Aviator"" is beautiful. Scorsese uses his full array of camera tricks to get the desired effect. Scenes set in different periods have different looks. The CGI, while not seamless, is not overused. An added bonus is a spectacularly filmed aeroplane crash sequence that is actually quite startling.In terms of directing, the film marks another excellent effort by Martin Scorsese. While not as good as ""Goodfellas"", ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull"", it is on par with efforts such as ""Gangs of New York"". As mentioned previously, the Director uses all his camera tricks expertly to show the viewer what the character is feeling. Interestingly, the director chooses to express some of Hughes' eccentric behaviour in a humorous tone.In conclusion, ""The Aviator"" is an excellent motion picture with mild annoyances. Fans of Scorsese, DiCaprio and Howard Hughes should not be disappointed, but the film's running time of just under three hours may be too much for some.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Quality movie, just don't operate heavy machinery after watching it.","I usually don't write too many reviews on Oscar caliber movie since I enjoy complaining more than anything else, but I had to cover a few points for some of the potential viewers that are contemplating whether or not to rent this movie or not. Although ""The Aviator"" is a good movie, but there are some serious long, dry, needless scenes that may make you forget the scenes you did like.""Aviator"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio, who is still trying to get respect in Hollywood, as Howard Hughes, a rich oil tycoon that suddenly decides to invest an obscene amount of money and time into movies, planes, women and bottled milk. The film is also filled to the brim with tons of Hollywood's finest, especially Kate Blanchet who perfectly plays Katherine Hepburn about as well Jamie Foxx played Ray Charles. Later on through the film you find out there is something more behind his perfectionism, as his OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) is unrecognized by the American public.The movie really starts off with a bang, capturing Hughes over budget movie ""Hell's Angels"", with some of the nicest cinematography I've seen in a long while. Without giving too much away, the film quickly takes a turn and levels off in the excitement section as you witness Hughes's OCD in full effect, practically driving him in to insanity. This is where the film gets long, and I mean long. Besides the fact the the film is close to 170 minutes, after about an hour into to the film the emotion and liveliness in the beginning is replaced by boring, frustrating dialog and context. Seriously, this film makes ""Gods and Generals"" look like ""Die Hard"", making me extremely sympathetic to the audiences that actually saw it in a theater who probably wished they went to an opera instead. In fact, the ending doesn't due Hughes or the film much justice either as it just closes with him going through one of his OCD fits.With all the torturing boredom aside, ""Aviator"" is still a quality film film that was informative, contained remarkable acting on every part, exceptional cinematography that put's right in to the time frame of the movie. It's also once again another Oscar worthy performance by DiCaprio who still trying to get people to forgive for ""Titanic"" and his good looks. For the most part, I knew pretty much nothing about the Howard Hughes, and the film did it's job by reflecting Hughe's life.

The Aviator (2004),"Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, John C. Reilly, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Matt Ross, Adam Scott, Kate Beckinsale, Danny Huston, Ian Holm, Kelli Garner, Jude Law. (PG-13)Extravagant biopic on the life of Howard Hughes (about twenty years worth, anyway): aviation trailblazer, Hollywood director, womanizer of Tinseltown starlets, and eventual obsessive-compulsive recluse. Scorsese proves again his mastery of filmmaking technique and storytelling, crafting a sensationally vast and detailed world (with the help of superb talents like editor Thelma Schoonmacher, director of photography Robert Richardson, art designer Dante Ferretti, and many more) and using plenty of the ol' ""movie magic"" to make the presentation stylized yet remarkably authentic (even employing recreations of two-strip and three-strip Technicolor to represent different periods). However, unlike most of Scorcese's other rich central-figure character studies (from Jake LaMotta to Jesus Christ), there doesn't seem to be a prevailing thesis or attitude to the subject; should Hughes be admired, pitied, scorned, championed, etc.? The cast, populated by many famous faces in roles both small and large, rarely disappoints; it was DiCaprio's best work since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" and aside from coming off a bit cartoonish during her early golf game scene, Blanchett is just about perfect as Katharine Hepburn (and won her first Oscar for it).89/100",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Aviator,"Disappointed before I watched the movie. I thought it would be cinematic masterpieces, but the movie seriously disappointed me.

Had the movie been based on Howard's struggle against the rival company, it could have been a lot better. The characters in the movie were superficial. You can summarize any letter in one or two words. Except for Howard who was a complex and interesting character.

Rise and fall,"'The Aviator' was one of the first collaborations between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo Dicaprio. A film that bears the imprint of the director in print and could be one of the least valued in his career, despite its high stylistic quality.
The story tells the life of the well-known Howard Hughes and how he went from being a recognized magnate to a self-contained man, added to his obsessive compulsive disorder that increased year after year. Finally, the film is about a man who was at the top and had everything, but who for different reasons lost it. This theme is highly recurring in Martin Scorsese's filmography, and although this film is unusual for the director, its style is fully incorporated. However, this very identifying style of the filmmaker undergoes some changes, such as greater attention to the use of colors. Visual changes mostly, because the narrative follows the same line as other Scorsese movies.
There is not much more to say besides that this film is yet another proof of Scorsese's masterful ability to tell a story of power and subsequent fall, but more important than that, it shows his ability to innovate in the way of telling stories.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ahead in the clouds...,"When it comes to filmed biographies, I set a simple standard. For me the minimum expectation in seeing a film biography is that, in the end, I walk away with the feeling that I have met someone worth meeting. Just because the subject of the film is famous or important won't impress me; the film has to prove that that person should be important to me.I mean, when I left the film MELVIN AND HOWARD, a slice-of-life comedy about Melvin Dumar whose brief encounter with celebrity gave him his 15 minutes of fame, I was exhilarated; the film introduced me to someone unique, someone I was glad I met, no matter how fleeting the meeting or fleeting his fame. On the other hand, when I walked out of RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS, two wildly overpraised bios by Martin Scorsese, my honest reaction was ""So what?"" Jake LaMotta and Henry Hill were of no interest to me before those films and are of even less interest to me now. And nothing Scorsese did stylistically within those films made those characters in any way interesting. I think RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS are lousy movies because those characters did not touch me in anyway.Now here is Scorsese, the maker of those two films, directing a biopic about Howard Hughes, the Howard in MELVIN AND HOWARD. The film does have one thing in its favor immediately: Hughes was one fascinating individual, so it would seem almost impossible to make an uninteresting film about him. Though, one would have to overlook THE CARPETBAGGERS, the silly 1962 soap opera loosely based on Hughes' life; and to take into account that the subject of THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ was also an incredible individual, yet Scorsese managed to do a total hatched job on him.THE AVIATOR suffers from the same problem as most biopics: too much story, too much man, too much legend and too little time. Who he was competes for screen time with what he did. Even as it pushes toward three hours, it barely touches upon the influence that the man had. A whole film could have been made just about his dabbling in movie making. But the film does a great job at targeting the highlights of his early life and using those moments to illustrate his advancing state of mental illness. And even then, the film seems incomplete as it ends his story long before the intensity of Hughes' mental illness took control of his life. Ironically, the film takes on too much of his life and yet doesn't cover enough of it.Perhaps the most interesting thing about THE AVIATOR is that it a sympathetic story about a multimillionaire. Indeed the film's advertising sells it as a man-against-the-system success story, even though the battles he fights are largely designed to consolidate his power and increase his wealth. What Hughes does in the film seems neither more nor less ruthless, reckless and/or self-centered than any of his adversaries. He was, it would seem, born into wealth; lived the life of a spoiled playboy, noted for his numerous affairs; and excelled at being an aggressive businessman, not above hostile takeovers. Just the sort of character that Hollywood loves to hate. The film could have easily painted a very cruel and negative picture of Hughes, but, perhaps because of his mental illness -- or perhaps because, like Scorsese, Hughes was an obsessive filmmaker -- the story is at the very least respectful of the man and his accomplishments.At first Leonard DiCaprio seems far too young to play Hughes, especially as the prevailing image of Hughes is either that of an older man in his prime or as an old man, stewing in the decay of his own mental illness and the cocoon of wealth. But DiCaprio does a remarkable job of showing us that Hughes had a youth, that he was an angry, aggressive young man of considerable ambition and a degree of genius. And DiCaprio takes Hughes past the stages of callow youth and into the physical and mental decline of a wounded warrior. One hopes that DiCaprio will revisit the character in a decade or two to explore the second half of the millionaire's eccentric life. There is more to be told and DiCaprio seems to have the talent to see this man's life through. DiCaprio's efforts are only overshadowed by Cate Blanchett's scene-stealing turn as a strong-willed and tough-minded Katharine Hepburn.If I have any real problem with THE AVIATOR it is that it does seem to adhere to the standard biopic blueprint of this-happened-that-happened. The story might have been better approached in the style of CITIZEN KANE, juggling the past with the present, telling the story from various viewpoints. After all, Hughes was a Kane-like figure: powerful, ruthless, kind, self-important and contradictory. KANE's message was that you can't really get to know a man; THE AVIATOR seems to think it knows its subject a little too well. But as is, the film is a solid and entertaining piece of stylish and colorful film-making. It takes off and stays aloft until the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Marty's Direction and Cate's Acting in its bests.,"Howard Hughes was one of the richest man in his time, a prominent film producer, record setting pilot, engineer and above all a business magnate, who also suffer from Obsessive - Compulsive Disorder (OCD). In this biopic Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes, in his youth with all his passion, dedication, craziness and eccentricity. He is so daring that the movie is as much a thriller as it is a drama.
And there we see another beautiful collaboration forming up with Scorsese and DiCaprio.Let me take some words to say about the brilliant Oscar and SAG winning performance by Cate Blanchett. She plays a real life actress who was known for her unconventional off screen life. Now acting is one thing and acting an actor is a whole another thing and not just any, but the greatest female star of Classic Hollywood Cinema, Katharine Hepburn herself. For a 3 hour long movie she had such a short screen time but she was simply stunning with her mannerisms replicating Hepburn.Scorsese designed each year in this movie to look just the way a color movie from that time period would look. Seeing it for the second time was even more enthralling and made me adore the mastercrafter even more. This is clearly one of the best directed movies i have seen of any directors. Scorsese earned his 5th Oscar, 6th Golden Globe and 6th DGA nominations with this film.Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 5, the highest number of nominations and win on 2005 Oscar, 14 BAFTA nominations and 4 wins including Best Picture, 6 Golden Globe nominations and 3 wins including Best Picture and Lead Actor, this isTHE AVIATOR
A MARTIN SCORSESE BIOPIC on HOWARD HUGHES",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too Big,"I am a huge fan of Martin Scorsese. Raging Bull and Goodfellas are two of my favorite movies of all time. They were so good because of the smaller scope of their stories. They were more personal and thus I felt I could get closer to the characters. In Scorcese's two latest films however(Gangs of New York and now The Aviator) he has abandoned the small story for epic biopics. By tackling the grand scale of the life of Howard Hughs in The Aviator, I did not feel the intimacy that made his earlier films so excellent. That is not to say that The Aviator is a poor picture by any means. DiCaprio as Hughs is great and Blanchett is astounding as Hepburn. Her performance should receive recognition by both the foreign press and the academy. Moreover the cinematography (especially in the scenes where Hughs films Hells Angels) is excellent. Nonetheless to me, The Aviator for its lack of intimacy was not an enjoyable film. Because of the hugeness of the film, it drags. I fear that The Aviator will be the big winner this year as it has all the characteristics of recent winners: a famous director, big name actors and an epic plot. I know it would be a crime for Scorsese to never receive an Oscar, but really he is not as deserving for this film as others. What really saved the movie for me was Blanchett's performance. I would not mind seeing her win big this year.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
1and 1/2 stars at best,"I was more or less sure that I would'not like this movie and alas I did not!! None of the characters were believable. The casting was about as bad as you could get. When a movie goes out and gets all of the available stars--one should know, it's probably not a very good film!! While maybe the Howard Hughes story is worth while telling, this attempt was way off the mark. So assuming it could have been, not only a passable movie, but maybe even an award winning piece of work. One would have to start totally over--DIRECTOR-WRITER-AND FOR SURE THE CAST!!!!! If this movie wins any serious award, I'll be surprised and even more so wonder did they see the same thing I saw.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Enthralling movie,"This is a great movie. I think I probably enjoyed it more because I did not know two things - (1) I didn't know much about Howard Hughes and (2) I didn't know that Martin Scorsese directed the movie.The acting by Leonardo diCaprio in the lead role is fantastic. He is a very good actor and totally dominates this movie. The only guy that comes close to him is Alec Baldwin as the boss of PanAm.Scorsese very cleverly weaves in some hints about Howard Hughes' mental problems early on in the movie, including what appears to be obsessive compulsive disorder. It was quite remarkable that a person with such health problems was able to achieve so much.There are some excellent scenes in the movie. The lunch scene with Katherine Hepburn and her family is very memorable as is the scene before the Congressional committee. There are also some humorous scenes such as his defence of Jane Russell's mammaries in the movie The Outlaw.While the movie is quite long, I would have liked to see the movie continue to the end of his life. However, from what I understand of Howard Hughes' later years, it may have been quite difficult to film given how erratic his behaviour became.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining and well done biopic,"I'm not usually a fan of biopics, or even Martin Scorsese films in general, but surprisingly enough; this one, in spite of it's lukewarm critical reaction, is actually really good, and definitely well worth seeing. Much of the criticism landed on The Aviator has come about because of the fact that it's not very deep and while this is a problem for the film, it didn't upset me too much because what we do have is a stylish and always interesting film, which evenly covers up it's shortfall in substance with it's positive aspects. The film follows the story of Howard Hughes; an aeroplane and filmmaker in Hollywood's golden era. The film starts during the troubled shoot of Hughes' debut film; Hell's Angels, and ends somewhat prematurely as Hughes is still a young man. We are never really allowed to get into the subject's head, but this doesn't seem to be an accident, as it was obvious to me that Scorsese was more interested in portraying the history behind the man than his psychological profile. Scorsese gives us enough of the man to keep us interested in him, but stays true to the facts of his life to an extent in which the film is always kept interesting.Leonardo DiCaprio seems to have replaced Robert DeNiro as Scorsese's muse, and despite a disappointing turn in the sub-standard 'Gangs of New York', DiCaprio shines here and really does well as the rich, yet troubled, Hollywood icon at the centre of this story. Scorsese seems to have a bit overboard with the cast, as several big names of the present appear as big names of the past. Cate Blanchett irritated me just as much as the real Katherine Hepburn did, which shows the greatness of her performance. Kate Beckinsale and, surprisingly, Gwen Stefani give life to two of Hollywood's golden girls; Ava Gardner and Jean Harlow as well, while smaller roles such as that of the charismatic Errol Flyn fall to the likes of Jude Law. This was the film's major selling point for me - there's something great about the big stars of today portraying the big stars of the golden age, and the way that Scorsese populates almost every scene with the big names of the time ensures that this is as much a film fan's movie as it is a multi-million dollar blockbuster. Critics can complain about a lack of substance as much as they like, but what I saw here was an excellently stylish take on one of Hollywood's most intriguing figures, and I don't hesitate to call this Scorsese's finest hour since Goodfellas back in 1990.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Should have been called The Sh*tiator,"This was a terrible film, probably one of the worst to come out this year (although that's not saying a whole lot). I thought DiCaprio looked like a scared 10 year old boy pretending to be an obsessive compulsive retarded chimpanzee. I don't know what Scorcese was thinking...why did it have to be 3 f**king hours long!!! I wanted to vomit all over myself. The fact that he had to rely on cheap computer graphics made the whole film seem cheesy and fake. This only confirms my theory that Scorcese has outlived his glory days, and will spend the rest of his film-making days trying to make epic over-inflated, under inspired pictures that fall horribly short. Even as a fan of aviation I was not very interested in watching the movie because I was so disgusted. I thought the urine in the milk bottles was a bit funny though.",,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful + Sad + Thrilling,"I'm going to be incredibly blunt here with two things displaying some ignorance: I knew little to nothing about Howard Hughes before I watched this film. I'm also very late to the game with watching it in general. Last night, on a whim of a rabbit hole of watching films nominated for best picture, it was time to finally watch The Aviator.From the first few minutes of the film, I noticed that I was actually smiling at the screen and excited. The things Hughes was asking and demanding of his workers was all but ludicrous but he was asking anyway. His character drew me in almost immediately, as did every single supporting actor / actress.I don't like to offer spoilers to my reviews if I can help it, with this one I'll say it's easy not to. If you enjoy Scorsese films, have a few hours on your hands, and are ready for an adventure on your couch - choose this movie. You won't regret it. Brilliant. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A cowardly pioneer,"Howard Hughes was a tiny man in a gigantic world of Fascism, Hitlerism, and Stalinism. My friend Kim, in Salt Lake City, was dressed in his underwear, outside, by his mother, a Mormon. This was some kind of strange ritual, to me a Roman Catholic. It was a non-secret/secret. Adults have secrets. Mormonism is a big honking secret. His underwear and his mother dressing him in underwear were BIG secrets. It was weird. We Catholics in Salt Lake City had our own secrets. Open secrets in a Mormon world/state. I believe Howard Hughes may have grown up in a Mormon situation. Howard Hughes lived a full life and a crippled life which cannot be portrayed in film or text or any medium. Leonardo di Caprio did a great job portraying this sick person Hughes who had a fantastic life. His phobias were great secrets which needed a little open air to deflate their mythic power and thus be dis-armed. It was a sad thing that Hughes's phobias were not thrown asunder as his fantastic ideas were advanced. He deserved better. He deserved the love of Kate Hepburn, I suppose. She was a stellar gal. This is in sum a spectacular movie, which is as good as you could get considering this weird guy Hughes. This is a gigantic movie. Full of ideas. A spectacular gift from director Martin Scorcese.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Slow as syrup, but very well executed","I rented The Aviator along with other films that I picked up from blockbuster. Truly, I didn't really know if this was going to be a good movie or not. There has been a lot of mixed reviews on the movie because of its length, even though it was nominated for 11 Oscars. After viewing the movie, I thought it was pretty good. I mean I wasn't really disappointed in the film or happy at all, but it was just right what I actually was expecting. The directing by Martin Scorsese is of course great and he never fails and the acting is great by all the characters especially by DiCaprio and Blanchett by putting up hard roles. What the film lacked was its length and how slow it was. There was ever hardly any build ups to the movie and it kept me pretty uncomfortable in my seat. The movie was just a little too long and it could of been a little faster and not as slow. Overall, it was a pretty good film and it had a great atmosphere revolving around the 20's, 30's, and 40's, but in ways, it could've been better.Hedeen's Outlook: 7/10 **+ C+",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Where is his life?,If you take all of the bad moments from a mans life and remove the amazing stuff and you are talking about Howard Hughes then this is the movie you would end up with. I feel like I just watched a hit piece on the poor guy. Yes he suffered from mental illness and I'm sure this is important but I just spent far too much of my time in the lowest parts of his life. Frankly I would have loved to focus on the life of his party and not his decline. Money seemed to for some reason come out of thin air. no mention of what he was doing right. Also he was an innovator and very little time was spent on this. Come on Martin this guy's whole life was about innovation.

admirable sketch,"to present the life of Howard Hughes is one of ambitions who could define only the career of a great director. because it must have the most inspired form of screen. and, behind the secrets and speculations, to present the flavor, atmosphere, pillars and drawings of events - parts of an ambiguous existence seems be the best option. Scorsese use a perfect cast, use an inspired script, impose fragments as surrogate of entire story and recreates a world of glamor, vulnerabilities and power. result - not exactly a biography of Howard Hughes but an excellent sketch of his period. for Leonardo DiCaprio, the lead role represents a great challenge and he does an admirable job looking define Hughes in different aspects. but the best part is represented by Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale , each proposing seductive interpretations of legends of Hollywood. a film who surprised. and remains interesting for the art of detail.",,Anonymous,Biography
The Aviator is ideal for those boring afternoons in January when there's nothing on television and you're tired of sales.,"This is reflected in the film's exquisite look.

I love it!,"The movie ""The Aviator"" is directed by Martin Scorsese and written by John Logan. The movie tells the story of Howard Hughes, an American mogul, and it is portrayed through the use of jazz. Despite its long run time of 2 hours and 50 minutes, the movie is entertaining from start to finish. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is breathtaking, with panoramic views from above in Hughes's plane to the claustrophobic viewing room.Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Howard Hughes was commanding. Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn was phenomenal. Howard Shore's composition carried the story, and Sandy Powell's costume design was remarkable. Her costume design was a major key in convincing the audience that this was a tale of Howard Hughes from the 1920s to the 1940s.Overall, Martin Scorsese's direction of ""The Aviator"" was impressive.

A pity this wasn't the extended edition,"It seems that the Aviator is heading for Oscar glory this year, but if it does win I suspect it will be more of a nod to Scorsese's body of work. This is not to say that this is a bad film and it would have really deserved it's likely Oscar success had the majority of the first hour been saved for the extended edition DVD.The film focuses on the early years of Hughes especially his love of flying. His fight against mental illness is also dealt with and most people familiar with 20th century history will know where the story is leading. DiCaprio puts in a reasonable performance in the lead and is well supported by the rest of the cast including the excellent John C Reilly.Once the film gets into stride it's gripping during the second act.

Leonardo Portrays DiCaprio,"He looks like a little boy trying to play the role of a grownup. Has there ever been a worse casting mistake? With his baby face looks, his high pitch voice, his phony Texas twang, and his forced mannerisms, DiCaprio not only is the wrong actor for the role, he is so distracting as to ruin the entire film.That's the main problem. Another problem is the part of the plot that deals with the tedious technicalities of early aviation. I found it to be totally not interesting. Maybe it would be of interest to an aviation historian.In addition, the film gushes with busy hubbub and lots of non-substantive chatter. The screenplay must have weighed a ton. Despite all the dialogue, the film's script lacks an emotional spine, making the film seem shallow, superficial, and insincere.At a cost of over $100 million and a runtime of nearly three hours, the film conveys an air of superiority. It is very, very impressed with itself. It spews implied bravado. I cringe when I consider that the filmmakers could have made five very good films, costing $20 million each. Those are five films we will never see.However, if you like DiCaprio, the Hollywood ""star"", you will no doubt like this film. After all, ""The Aviator"" is mostly just a flashy cinematic vehicle to enhance his star status. Viewers looking for an honest and in-depth study of the life of Howard Hughes will need to look elsewhere.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scorsese and DiCaprio at their best,"That plane crash was probably one of the most brutal scenes that I have ever seen. You could see Scorsese winning Best Director right there.The performances were all excellent. Leonardo Dicaprio gave a so far career best performance. When he is in the car covering his mouth as he said the same thing over and over, It was very impressive.Blanchett gives the Hepburn in the movie life, energy, humor, depth, one of the best performances of the year. Beckinsale was also good. When she tears down the tape in the house, she serves the movie the way Blanchett does, though without as much depth, but still is excellent.Alan Alda deserved his nomination. He is a good villain, but also one who is thinking about playing the Washington game. The whole chairman scene with Baldwin was a good entry for his character. Also with the Baldwin character-Citizen Kane did pop into my head. It was probably the set, but his powerful character doing what he can to tear down Hughes reminded me of CK.The Aviator is one of the best movies of the year, even if it drags with the hearings, it provides for the set up for one of the more triumphant scenes with the flying of the Spruce Goose.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great Performance: Decent Movie,The Aviator features an incredible lead performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. Just as always his range in this movie is insane. Cate Blanchett is also really good here but a little underutilized. Scorsese's directing is obviously great. The movie has great atmosphere building and production design. The visual effects are hit or miss but the practical ones look good. The music is also pretty solid. However I think the movie is too long and the story loses momentum.

A worthy attempt,"This larger than life Biopic of the legendary Film Producer and Aviation Pioneer Howard Hughes is well intentioned and carefully directed by Martin Scorsese, but finally leaves one somewhat unsatisfied. It's the over long running time, and Leo DiCaprio playing Hughes. His enthusiasm for the subject, and strenuous effort at creating the character often dominates the screen, however his youthful looks are at odds with, and he lacks the statue for, the portrayal of such a notable, complex, and commanding figure and his decent into dementia. Hughes is regarded in America as some sort of hero for his spectacular failures as much as his achievements, then his weird reclusive life in the last years. He inherited a fortune from his father, and the fear of germs from his mother. At first looking as much like a baby faced James Cagney as Howard Hughes, DiCaprio is at his best in the later scenes, when makeup has given him some gravitas, and his handling of the dramatic mental decline. It is however the supporting actors that give the film most impact, notably Cate Blancett as a very convincing Kathleen Hepburn, Alan Alda as the aggressive Senator, and Alex Baldwin as CEO of Pan Am.The flying and cabaret sequences are well executed, the feeling for period effective. The film has a striking over the top pictorial quality as we might expect from a veteran like Scorsese, who as usual turns in a well crafted picture. Certainly worth a visit as it lifts a curtain on some of the more oddball aspects of the elusive Mr. Hughes and indeed Miss Hepburn.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
DiCaprio Won Me Over,"No, it's not the greatest film ever and both Ray and MDBaby both outdid it...but I came away with a greater respect for DiCaprio than I expected. After he seemed so wrong for the part in Gangs I wondered about his suitability for Howard Hughes. Between makeup and his hard work I came to believe he really WAS the reclusive Hughes. I'd be interested to know how many of the aircraft were real and how much was CGI. If you can find a more realistic special effects gig than the neighborhood crash of his spy plane I'd like to see it. Thought the switching from outdoor to indoor perspectives was convincing. There was something about the continuity of the film that left me wondering if Hughes just fell in and out of these paranoid fugues. One minute he's the Naked Unshaved Beast and then Ava has him spiffied up jousting with Congress. Jude Law and Alec Baldwin were useless high-priced additions that could have been used elsewhere.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
the aviator,"I loved the aviator. however, i've seen the actual people portrayed in this film and it's not horrible, but it isn't exactly great.

As for Ava Gardner and Katherine Hepburn's characters, they did great as well, but the research done for each character in the movie but i really don't believe they got deep enough in the characters' lives. Ava Gardner was a poor southern girl with a big drawl to start off and she really wasn't movie star material in the sense that she didn't want or need servants. she grew up during the great depression so she knew how to take care of things in a poor environment. in the film they portray her as though she's some rich kid. it surprises me that Mr. DiCaprio portrayed his character so very well. i don't think anyone has ever achieved that.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A large and excellent cast throughout its lengthy running time, a common Scorsese problem, is topped by Cate Blanchette's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, which must have been a bit intimidating I would think. Besides its excessive length, the other problem is its lead actor. While he is not bad, DeCaprio is miscast. He's just too young looking throughout when this was filmed and doesn't have the presence for this larger than life role. Many have talked about filming this story for decades, particularly Warren Beatty. It's such an interesting tale about one of the most famous men to have ever lived that it is a shame now that it has finally been done that it is not special in some way, but it just isn't.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Sorry, but, Marty strikes out again!","Okay, I was lucky enough to see The Aviator in Hollywood, along with half of the world celebrities. With all of the hype of this movie, you would think that Christmas is coming early.This three hour film starts off well enough but seriously loses steam after it's first hour with Hughe's funding of his big project, Hell's Angels, by the end of the film, with the Spuce Goose, barely anyone in the audience was noticing. Blame it on the slow moving script by John Logan which just skims over Hughes life.Sorry to disappoint you, but, Marty Scorsese strikes out again, with a lackluster script and terrible performances by Leo and Gwen Stafani.This movie putters along like a tortoise, with an occasional brief appearance from some of Hollywood's greatest early actresses.However, one of the main problems, is that Leo DiCaprio just is not believable at all as Howard Hughes in the least. He looks, acts, talks, and dresses like Leo DiCaprio. Every time he spoke I thought he was the drifter from Titanic trying unsuccessfully to imitate Howard Hughes, as well as Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.There are great performances from Jude Law as Errol Flynn, and Cate Blanchett as Kathrin Heppern.However, my advice to No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stafani is to keep your day job, because you seriously need acting lessons. You make look like Jean Harlow, but you sure don't act like her in the least. Also, Kate Beckinsale looks strikingly close to Ava Gardner, but, she basically sleepwalks through her role.Also, I don't think that Marty Scorsese was up to the task of directing the biography of Howard Hughes, I think that Michael Mann should have kept the project, as he is more suited to successfully direct compelling biographies.I think that Michael Mann and Marty Scorsese should have traded projects this year, with Mann directing The Aviator and Scorsese directing Collateral. I think the results would have been much better.All in all, not a total disaster, but far from the best film of the year.Two stars out of four, not worthy of a best picture award in the least.Far from Scorsese's best work.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Mesmerizing Biopic,"At nearly three hours long, this film might be suspected of needing editing, but it is interesting throughout. This is primarily due to the enthralling story of its subject, Howard Hughes. In fact, the film ends in 1947, nearly thirty years before Hughes' death---an amazing fact to comprehend when you consider the nature and quality of Hughes' life as portrayed at the end of ""The Aviator.""Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes as the larger-than-life persona he was, but manages to capture the smallest eccentricities and obsessions---traits that would later take command of his tragic life. The film portrays Hughes as a human dynamo, constantly curious and constantly determined to achieve great things. Yet sometimes he would undermine his own ambitions with an exhaustive focus on details. Likewise, he was not risk averse, but he eventually came to find threats, mostly imagined, in innocent situations and inconsequential choices. DiCaprio embodies these seeming contradictions, and it feels like director Scorsese deserves a portion of the praise.The other performances are strong as well. Cate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn---Hughes' companion for eighteen months---is captivating as the iconic actress who matched Hughes' independence and free spirit. Alan Alda deserves special mention as Senator Brewster, the unscrupulous politician who grabs the spotlight in Senate hearings that are meant to destroy TWA, one of Hughes' companies.Much has been written about Scorsese's use of post-production effects to achieve various film effects that mimic the film stocks of the times. When combined with tremendous sets and costumes, they allow the viewer to immerse completely in the ambience of the era.There are, I fear, no great lessons to be learned from the life of Hughes, which was uniquely singular, but the details of his life---even when edited and condensed into this dramatic version---are mesmerizing.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent!,"The Aviator/2004/Main Stars:Leonardo DiCaprioCate BlanchettKate Beckinsale I never knew Howard Hughes's life was really that interesting. I thought that Howard Hughes was just a rich obsessive-compulsive guy who wasn't worth knowing about. When I saw this movie that thought definitely went away. He really had a big influence on planes and movies about them. Of course, seeing Leonardo DiCaprio's buttocks was extremely nauseating but the movie itself was amazing! Some people may be familiar with the movie ""Hell's Angels"" (a movie about World War I) and in this movie there was a big scene about that with planes flying around like one hundred birds in the air. What I really thought was amazing in this movie was the cinematography (the filming) because of how the camera moved around it is really difficult to explain why it was so good but in my opinion, it just was. Actually, the movie did win an Academy Award for the cinematography so apparently I'm not the only one that thinks this movie had really good filming. As you probably know, this movie won a few Academy Awards and was nominated for a few more besides cinematography and I thought it really deserved that. I especially wanted Leonardo DiCaprio (playing Howard Hughes) to win an Academy Award for Best Actor but he was only nominated for that. He, along with Cate Blanchett (playing Katherine Hepburn) and Kate Beckinsale (playing Ava Gardner) were the best actors (actresses) in the movie. Howard Hughes is known to be obsessive-compulsive. He also is known to be one of the most famous aviators of all time. Katherine Hepburn is known to be outgoing, independent, and to me she seems quite annoying in a way. And Ava Gardner is known to be adventurous, quite calm, and also independent. In my opinion, the actor and actresses that played them played their roles perfectly. In my opinion, nothing at all was boring in this movie but my brother really thought so because he doesn't like these types of movies at all. He really is a big fan of vulgar comedies. Anyway, in this last sentence, I will tell you what this movie was about- this movie was specifically about the history of Howard Hughes's life. I'm sorry for a very long review but there's just a whole lot to talk about in this classic film. By the way, this movie is very long (about three hours) and I think you know what I am going to tell you- go to the bathroom. Movie directed by Martin Scorsese.",,Anonymous,Biography

Riveting,"This film had a lot of competition that year at the Oscars! Does it live up to the performances of Million Dollar Baby and Ray? Well, almost. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a very flawed man who starts off like any other risk-addicted control freak but becomes an intensely troubled recluse. We are taken along with his bravado but also sceptical of how much control he really has. This becomes apparent to the other characters who react with anything from bemusement, frustration and exploitation. In the end, his ego becomes overshadowed by his mental condition and he succumbs to his fate.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Brilliant Film Making, Unsympathetic Storytelling.","The Aviator.A somewhat hard picture to judge. Overall I would say I enjoyed it. But then again, most Scorcese stuff will never be garbage, or never really be uninteresting. To be honest I thought The Aviator was a more interesting story than Raging Bull. Maybe because stories about boxers never interested me. Maybe that's why I think The Aviator was a far better film than Million Dollar Baby.So the Aviator is a sub-par epic, by an incredible filmmaker and storyteller. The production values, acting, etc etc are excellent. The story of Hughes is just too sad and screwed up to be as memorable as something like Goodfellas or Taxi Driver. The movie isn't just well done because its a Martin Scorcese movie and people automatically give it props, it is definitely worth seeing. He's mastered elegant, original storytelling, I just think the angle to take on someone like Howard Hughes was the only misstep in the film.Maybe I have a weird lust for long epic movies, but the ending just felt so unsatisfying. Because the movie makes his character seem to interesting, and the film just ends when he's what? 40. If you become engaged in the story (as I did), You end up thinking..."" do I have to read a Howard Hughes biography to know what madness, and ridiculously admirable ambition and...more madness came to this guy for the rest of his life??!?"" I guess so.I think the ultimate annoyance people had with the movie is...its ability to showcase Howard Hughes massive weirdness, but nobody really feels empathetic to it. It's like watching some ranting homeless guy downtown rant on about the government and society. You know that he might actually be making some sense, and he might be right, but you still want to beat him until he shuts up and stops acting so ridiculously strange. There's a very minute audience that kind find empathy for germaphobes. The empathy for his struggle against pretty obvious government misconduct in his business, is diminished by our lack of empathy for his eccentricity.DiCaprio was fantastic though. Probably the strongest performance of his career. Scorcese not winning the Oscar seems...unfair but almost just. The academy has a very stubborn manner of reflecting its honors on those who are making their best work, not work of brilliance, but declining brilliance. Clint Eastwood was making his best work as a director, and Scorcese well...his work in Goodfellas was worth two Oscar's...but his work on Aviator wasn't quite worth one.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good biopic,"Movies set in southern California around the 1930s always fascinate me--the larger than life Hollywood people, the surroundings before it all deteriorated, etc. Leo Dicaprio turns in a fine performance as the enigmatic Howard Hughes, a man who was many things -- brilliant, strange, obsessive, and innovative. I detest Katherine Hepburn, but Cate Blanchett's portrayal of her is very well done. We see several other Hollywood personalities in the film--Ava Gardner, Faith Domergue, Louis B. Mayer, and Errol Flynn among them. Hughes wanted to be known primarily as an aviator, and we see him as such. We also see his strange obsessions with order and cleanliness. The color palette of the film changes over time. Fine supporting cast.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Howard, Leo and Oscar","This biopic about an eccentric and influential mogul, Howard Hughes, was more artistic than historically accurate, even though the symbolism was so obvious, it took away from the artistic license. Was Scorsese trying to dumb it down for the general public? I thought I caught a glimpse of a bright, blue Ked's label on Howard's sneakers when he was dancing the Samba with Faith. Did Ked's exist 70 years ago? Was DiCaprio really the right match to play Hughes? I'll get to that later.The over zealous portrayal of Kate Hepburn by Cate Blanchett was saccharin, i.e. sickly sweet. Cate almost pulled off the great face that Kate was famous for, but I thought she could have gone the extra mile and shed a few more pounds to look more the part. By Contrast, Kate Beckinsdale could have gained a few pounds to play bombshell Ava Garner, (Beckinsdale was all shell and no bomb).Gwen Stephani, on the other hand, was the perfect face for the era which brings me to what I did like - the music, the costumes (minus the Ked's), the cinematography, the colours, the textures - visually it gets a thumbs up. If you like the 20's, 30's and 40's on film, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. If you're over 50, chances are you will really enjoy it.I read other comments saying that DiCaprio's performance was infantile and that he didn't have enough talent for mature, deep roles. I disagree. He did a good acting job in ""The Aviator"" because he went beyond himself, especially in the scene where Hughes cages himself inside his personal cinema. Although his accent was inconsistent, a personal pet peeve, DiCaprio's ability to play a character with penetrating quirks was reminiscent of Academy Award winner Jack Nicholson in ""As Good As It Gets"", Russell Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and even himself in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". His acting was better than Robert Downey Jr. in ""Chaplin"", to make a comparison. Leo was on screen so much, all but about two scenes, it won't be surprising if he's matched up with another mogul - Oscar.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good film,"Good film - The presentation of the film, in an evolving color (from two-tone Technicolor, as Martin explained it to us, to three-tone, to modern by the later sequences) is absolutely stunning, and the cinematography by renowned Robert Richardson, ASC, is some of the best I've seen (and, in my opinion, deserving of an Oscar).Cate Blanchett was impeccable as Katharine Hepburn, though, at times, I felt that the complexity of her character was never really deeper than a surface analysis.She did her role flawlessly, but this is not to say that it really Alec Baldwin portrayed one of the flattest villains I've seen in a major motion picture, but, again, this is about Howard Hughes, and DiCaprio's performance is worthy of an Oscar nod at least, and perhaps an Oscar Win (certainly the best performance I've seen all year).One of my few complaints, though, is the lengthy sequences featuring Howard Hughes as a solo aviator. Though interesting, entertaining even, the film was long enough already, and did not require such an exhaustive analysis of individual flight procedures.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Totally uninteresting film !!!!,"So where do i start ..hmm . film is really uninteresting i had watch the movie until end only cause my girlfriend push me to it..for her only reason why film is good cause Di Caprio is in it !! So i would agree with other users that was one big TORTURE !!And the end of the film also what happened with with Howard and when did he died ,or did he finished in hospital , the film was only about before-war years and war years and i don't know what to say anymore but for me this film was one big disappointment..And yet, despite the obvious talent of all those involved and Scorsese's ability to effortlessly fill three hours, something about The Aviator fails to completely satisfy. Without wanting to sound like a film student, movies should, ultimately, be ABOUT something; love, honor, courage, redemption, the BIG ideas and themes that are the fuel of the plot. What was the drive of The Aviator? A rich guy recklessly spends lots of money to indulge his personal obsessions and gets away with it.That is all point of the movie and i don't know how can that be interesting for the viewers ... So here is my vote ..1 (awful) >>!!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Very Interesting Movie,"I Found the Aviator very compelling to watch and enjoy, despite its length i felt it was perfectly paced and captured my interest very early on in the film. Some of the visuals in the movie are a brilliant demonstration of how to utilise modern effects and keep them realistic, and although used throughout the movie, at no time do they look out of place.Great credit has to go to the cast, who all produced fine performances. In particular Dicaprio who captured Hughes's excentricity with imagination and conviction and Blanchett, who successfully brings Hepburn to life.BUTScorcese has to take most of the credit for the film's success, he really does capture the audience with his stylish direction. This is not his greatest achievement, but its damn good.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Aviator Flies High,"Billionaire Howard Hughes is the subject of an epic biography, The Aviator, and it is just big enough to encompass the early adult years of a reclusive, eccentric original who battles the doubters and his own inner demons. Spearheaded by Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Hughes, this project started with Michael Mann (who remains a producer) and was ushered to realization by director Martin Scorsese.The film wisely settles on Hughes' life particularly between 1927 and 1947. A brief opening scene shows Hughes as a boy being washed by his mother while preaching quarantine and cleanliness. Cut to Hughes in the late 1920's as a young man with a tool company in Texas who is trying to film a large scale war film, Hell's Angels. A perfectionist, Hughes is determined to capture great aerial scenes no matter the time and cost. He hires Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) to watch the company's finances as he begins to explore the limits of airplane design and travel. He discovers a young starlet, Jean Harlow, and begins romancing some of Hollywood's female glamour stars like Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner. Gradually, his compulsive disorders worsen and are complicated by his failed relationships and a couple of near fatal air disasters. His urge to fly and create bigger and faster planes puts him on a collision course with a competitor from Pan Am and ultimately the U.S. Congress.While Howard Hughes' life has been the stuff of movie material for decades, this big budget film finally marshals the appropriate talent and resources to do it justice. Previously, 1964's The Carpetbaggers seemed inspired by Hughes' film career. In 1977, a TV movie called The Amazing Howard Hughes featuring Tommy Lee Jones did a good job of spanning his life. Even the fanciful comedy/drama Melvin and Howard played on a thread of Hughes' supposed encounter with a stranger. Yet it took the combined might of Miramax and Warner Brothers to give the story the needed blockbuster budget. And if having Scorsese direct a biography is like asking Picasso to do a Superman comic, then so be it. He does an admirable job of depicting intimate scenes and set pieces intermixed with period and story. It is a solid piece of storytelling by a master director working off a good script by John Logan (Gladiator).What is compelling about Hughes is how reckless and human he was while at the same time becoming a sympathetic victim of his afflictions. As his ticks and behavior become increasingly obsessive, there is a genuine sense of inevitability as we watch the beginnings of his legendary, sanitized lifestyle to come. The scenes involving his clash with the U.S. Senate are like watching a newsreel come to life. It is fascinating stuff even as we are rooting for Hughes to prevail. In the end, Hughes is a slice of the American Dream crossed with the American Tragedy.DiCaprio is quite good as the aviator and while those that remember the real Hughes may never have dreamed of young Leonardo playing this role, he has embodied the spirit and behavior quite convincingly; he gets the feel and angst of the man. In the latter half of the film, he looks like a dead ringer for Hughes right down to his arched eyebrow.The rest of the supporting cast is strong. Cate Blanchett is excellent as Katharine Hepburn. She not only has Kate's appearance and vocal quality down, but she has made her a vivid, intelligent human whose relationship with Hughes is the focus for much of his life. This is no mere cardboard impersonation. Kate Beckinsale plays Ava Gardner and does credible job in a role which is also important in Hughes' later life. Alan Alda is a standout as an unscrupulous U.S. Senator who is a henchman for air exec, Alec Baldwin. Even the smaller parts are a hoot with such stars as Jude Law playing Errol Flynn and Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. Willem Dafoe (The Last Temptation of Christ) has a bit role of a tabloid writer.As said before, the production is big and splashy. The set designs are top notch from nightclub recreations to air hangars to a congressional hearing room. Costume design (Sandy Powell-Gangs of New York) is like Edith Head reborn. The dramatic musical score (Howard Shore-The Lord of the Rings) is unobtrusive and well integrated in the story. Cinematography (Robert Richardson-Casino) and editing (Thelma Schoonmaker-Raging Bull) in a Scorsese film is always imaginative and unique without calling self attention. The air scenes whether in Hells Angels or the test flights are exhilarating and through live action and special effects, recall some of the exciting moments of The Right Stuff. What are just as impressive are the details in this larger than life production. For example, when Hughes emerges from a self imposed quarantine, his staffers are going about their work wearing white gloves. Film purists will enjoy the clips or references to other Hughes productions like Scarface (1932) and The Outlaw.Ultimately, this ambitious tale is not only well told, but you get a true sense of the man, and that is no mean feat. Sure, the film is lengthy and drags a little in the second half as it probes his illness, but it isn't long before another scene picks up the plot, and the film moves to a grand scale again. It has been a good year in 2004 for movie biographies, and while The Aviator is the biggest of the bunch it is also one of the best.***1/2 out of **** stars",,Anonymous,Biography

This is the story of entrench millionaire Howard Hughes and his journey through Hollywood and endeavors as a aviation innovator.,"Howard Hughes was one of the first Hollywood major directors and this story tells it greatly. Martin Scorcese's masterful direction and years of experience pay off because this movie is directed greatly from the grand sweeps of cinematography to small shots of people at tables. Leonardo DiCapreo plays this legendary director with the nuance of his mannerism to his overarching larger than life presence. The writing is smart and intelligent and gets to the point when it needs to and pass along the story with a stable brisk pace. All the supporting cast helps to put order when Howard Hughes more awkward mannerisms take over the story. Kate Blanchet has excellent chemistry with the lead and the two work of each other well. Everything comes together to make an exciting and odd true story of an unusual filmmaker, aviator, and person.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Truly Underrated Oscar Nominee,"While most critics and Academy voters saw it fitting that The Aviator should receive a Best Pic and Best Director nod, it seems most of America's film-going public felt another way about it. ""Overblown"" ""too long"" and ""not perfect"" were words I have heard used to describe it. In the Scorcese vs Eastwood debate, many claimed they'd rather see Marty win for a better film. But this is, without a doubt, one of Scorcese's finest. Though perhaps too similar in scale to the similarly dismissed ""Gangs of New York"", this is one swift, cunning piece of directing on the part of Mr. Scorcese.Depicting those years where Howard Hughes teetered on the edge of sanity while achieving so much in so little time, the film's most touching moments are the quietest, when the camera and the actor and director all seem to try and calm down a minute, take a breath, regain control.Shot and edited like the way Hughes lived, it has a frenetic, implacable chemistry, jumping from extreme excitement to terrifying emotional scares. A credit to Leo DiCaprio as an actor, the sequence at the Coconut Grove bathroom is one of the film's finest, and sloppiest in a way. And that's the way the whole film plays. It almost feels improvised. It has the storytelling of a nine-year-old boy out of breath from a great adventure. And you can't help but connect it's hair-brained energy and logical flow to its anchor, Howard Hughes. And while I won't stay up too long lamenting Scorcese's fifth loss at the Oscars, I will note that he went down with another of his best films. Hopefully, someday very soon, he'll find the connection to his art that Clint Eastwood has found at age 74, and see there's so many more of his own stories to tell. But still, the Aviator is one of those too, and please look into it more closely before you blow it off.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Now do you see how good Leo is??,"Titanic was such a disaster for Leonardo DiCaprio's credibility, but I think he's finally won it back with this one. I think this an exceptional performance from Leonardo and I agree with comparisons to DeNiro in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. Go on all you Leo critics: watch The Basketball Diaries and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, etc etc. the boy can act!! I was critical of his performances in The Beach and Gangs Of New York (which I don't really like as a film), but this performance in the Aviator has won over a lot of Leo-haters, so intense, you can just see how hard he's working! My only criticism of The Aviator is it's too long. I don't know why everyone is making 3hr films nowadays, but I think Scorsese could have cut 30 to 60 minutes off this one, and still told us the story, it drags on and on. other than that it's excellent, it tells the story of genius Howard Hughs who I knew nothing about before. Well done Mr DiCaprio - keep it up! I'm a bit worried about Baz Luhrmann's Alexander, but it could be excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
ok,"As a huge fan of both Scorsese and Leonardo, I will always enjoy their work whatsoever. I didn't like how the movie flows.Frankly, as someone who knows nothing about Hughes, I wanted some insight in the beginning into to his personality/education/family life, just so I can have some engagement and attachment to the character and live his life that i'm watching. Unfortunately that didn't happen.. It went straight into a millionaire narcissist genius psychopath. Without any developmentWhat I watched was irregular flow of plot into his life that makes it very random.. I barely understood his personality until the end..
it started with him making movies throwing millions around suddenly a director then a pilot then engineer then playboy then narcissistic then psychopath then mentally troubled peeing in bottles then back to normal!!!!!! Common! I just wanted some decent background into his upbringing then how he honed his skills in aviation and how this passion in aviation developed!.. what made him a psychopath?All because of his mother I know, but can we get more insight? Why? How?You would expect that after watching a movie on someone life you would be fully informed and knowledgeable on their background life traits and all right?

Dreary acting and mis-casting,"Just another example of DiCapprio's lack of acting abilities. Not to mention mis-casting of the actresses. Shallow performances all around.Story is decent, but overshadowed by the lack of skill of the cast.I was hoping for a better bio-pic, but it seems to be a skill that Hollywood is now lacking. Gone are the days of great character actors playing roles in good films, they weren't always historically accurate, but at least they were viewable.By the end of The Aviator I wanted my money back.

overblown rubbish!,"After choosing to go and see this film for my 18th birthday on it's UK release on January 7th, i thought that this would be a great film. Following the Hollywood hype for months I was relieved when it finally came out even viewing it on the deluxe screen for £8.60!!!(around 14 dollars) per person!!, to enrich the viewing experience and to cope with three hours worth of Hollywood overspending. I can't say that I regret it because it has made me realise what a completely monotonous film this is, just flying and crashing planes ,which seems to go on for an ridiculously unnecessary time span. The ending is probably the worst i have seen for ages, not in anyway rounding of the film to an acceptable standard, just leaving it where most of the film has been for three hours prior. How it has been nominated for so many undeserved Oscars is completely beyond me, with the nomination for best film a joke!! I am relieved that million dollar baby won, being far more poignant and proof itself that it isn't about special effects and how many stars you shove into one film that wins, it is the content and the story.

In a virtual drought of good movies for 2004---this is the best I've seen this year!,"It is always a difficult thing to film a biography without beatifying the subject. In this movie, Scorcese shows us the Howard Hughes, the charmer, the Hollywood maverick, the Aviator. He also shows the demons that haunted and eventually possessed this great maverick! What Hughes accomplished was only overshadowed by what he could have been if he were able to control his neurosis that eventually overwhelmed him. I thought Leonardo gave one of his finest performances of his young career. The Aviator is a case study of one of the 20th Centuries most influential and most powerful men in this country. It also provides a snapshot into his personal life that shows him as a Hollywood playboy and publicity hound, but only to eventually promote his beloved Hughes Air/TWA. But, it truly conveys his real passion for flying and aviation. I strongly recommend this film as one of the better films of the year...if not the best, that I have personally seen! Its a little longish so don't drink too much soda.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Flight To The Finish.,"I first got this movie, excited that it was directed by Martin Scorsese, who is probably my favorite director. I tried to watch this numerous times and could only pass a half hour. I felt it was slow and that Leo's imitation of Howard Hughes's accent was annoying. I got rid of it-very disappointed with the movie.Then, a couple years later, I went to a used DVD store and found it for $1.88 and decided to give it another chance. About 2 bucks isn't a bad risk, right?There was no risk. I have no idea what changed, but I relished every moment of this movie, which runs just under 3 hours. The accent I adjusted to, and I was thrilled with the story.The movie follows Howard Hughes, a real life filmmaker with OCD. (One movie that he is known for is the 1932 version of Scarface. ) He made many movies with planes, and decided to try flying planes, and that became his new passion.This movie also goes deep into his OCD, which becomes a part of the PG-13 rating. In one scene, he cleans his hands in a restaurant bathroom so vigorously that he cuts his hands. He also has to wait for someone to enter to leave without touching the germy door. In a more intense part, he locks himself in his movie viewing room nude, talking into a tissue covered microphone. When he has to urinate, he uses empty milk bottles. Aspects like this could deepen conversation on OCD or cause a young viewer to want to learn more about the disorder.As a film buff, it was also neat to see how Hughes made movies, and all the stars he met. There is a scene where Cate Blanchett plays Katherine Hepburn.Howard Hughes had a fascinating life and, despite my first assumptions, it made for a great movie. This is one of Martin Scorsese's finest movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good, but not great, and certainly not Oscar material","I went to see this movie Saturday, and while it's good, it's not great and certainly not worth all the fuss being made over it. Ebert & Roeper oooohhhed and aaaaaahed over the crash scene, which certainly gave you a good perspective, however it was not at all realistic: a plane would not simply fly along straight while a wing on one side slices through a house. It might slice for a little bit, but only until the drag pulled the fuselage into the house demolishing both the plane and the house.The special effects, while outstanding for say, 5-10 years ago, are mediocre at best these days, particularly golfing: the ball looked like the golf ball in the game in the movie Outland, floating along rather than a realistic arc. The water was done better in Titanic, and while it was probably done as a ""stylistic"" choice, at times the movie looks like a B&W film badly colorized. No thanks.As far as the acting goes, it was pretty good, save that I don't understand the Oscar nomination for Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, who must be rolling in her grave at the caricature here.Leonardo does do a good job playing Howard Hughes, but the script is a little disjointed and the movie, albeit long already, ends before it really shows just how far Howard fell before the end.In the end, I recommend seeing it, but only at economy hour.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best Movie About Someone Unimportant,"If I wrote the tagline for this movie, it would read something like ""The Best Movie This Year about Someone Insignificant!"" You may argue that Howard Hughes was some sort of pioneer in the histories of both the movie and aviation, but I would reply that if Howard Hughes was not around to accomplish those things, someone else equally unimportant would have. I give credit that this movie accurately portrays Hughes as both a risk-taker and downright weirdo, was beautifully filmed, and very well acted. But I can't get past the fact that Howard Hughes was likely only well known because he was very wealthy, and a person whose quirks only make him an irritating nut who treated other people poorly, and recklessly threw millions of dollars away chasing white rabbits (or rather Spruce Gooses). From the movie, I didn't see that he was all that noble, not enough for us to sympathize with him and regard him as some sort of hero. This was certainly a very well-made film, deserving of accolades for its technical aspects, but ultimately whose subject really doesn't matter.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Brilliant High-Flying Epic,"Focusing from his early years (from the 1930 production of 'Hell's Angels' to the 1947 test flight of the blue Spruce,when he was 42),this is the story of how Howard Hughes transformed a small fortune into a massive one.Howard Hughes(Di Caprio) quickly moved to LA to become a Hollywood film producer,where he helped launch the career of Jean Harlow and other scarlets,and producing such as classics as Hell's Angels,The Front Page and the 1932 Scarface.Hughes legend come not from focusing on just Hollywood,however as he simultaneously branched into industry after industry,including aviation in 1932(including TWA Airlines,and during World War II,defense,leading leading to the creation of the Spruce Goose,a flying boat of immense size).Martin Scorsese once again make a brilliant movie of high flying epic abut story of Howard Hughes.There's no doubt about his works because he always gives the best effort to make a gorgeous and high class films such as Taxi Driver,Goodfellas,Raging Bull,etc.Scorsese also made his second collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio after Gangs of New York.DiCaprio gives a wonderful performance and become more mature to select a good role.We can give him a big applause for his talented acting to play the character of Howard Hughes.But don't forget Cate Blanchett.She plays the character of Katherine Hepburn and once again gives her high class acting and Oscar performance.John Logan who write the script has done the job very well.Not perfect but it doesn't disappoint me.And the last I'd like to give an honor to the beautiful score composed by Howard Shore and very nice cinematography captured by Robert Richardson.I really recommend this movie.My opinion,this is absolutely Film of the Year!

Short version of Howard Hughes' remarkable life and times,"This review stems from a ""rewatch,"" the first viewing occurring on New Year's Eve. It's a fairly long movie and our group was there through the ending into the new year in a nearly empty theater. But this is worthwhile movie-making; the writers give us a true American hero who takes on the State and, at least for a while, wins.Hughes was the son of a Texas oilman-inventor who set up a company and earned a fortune; the old man died when Howard was 18, leaving Howard as a multimillionaire engineering student. The Aviator follows Howard from 1930, when he produced the movie Hell's Angels, to 1947 when, at the age of 42, Howard flew the H4-Hercules aircraft he had designed and built (aka the Spruce Goose)...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as the lead and the movie (focusing more on Hughes' younger years) is an amazing, enjoyable watch from start to finish. Nice work with the CGI too.

Marty is BACK!,"""The Aviator"" is Martin Scorsese's best work in years. From the visual storytelling to the flamboyant acting.

The control of machines, flying through the wind. And he did. His playboy life is executed perfectly, but not without cameo's by Jude Law! The obsessed playboy himself.They're many things so perfect about the Aviator. Marty's perfect directing. The ensemble cast, Or even the incredible acting of Leonardo Dicaprio. But something else shines through in the film: Something beyond the director, producers, and actors. The life of this man.No one film can do his life justice.

It's one hell of a production which I'm sure had the Oscar Nominations Board purring and salivating non-stop round the clock.It is fascinating and it is an interesting watch but for me it's too long and a little bit boring. Just because a movie wins lots of Oscars doesn't necessarily mean it's an exciting movie and this fits into that category. It reminded me of Citizen Kane and I'd go as far as saying that it's basically the same kind of thing produced for a more modern audience. And that movie was pretty boring too.This is a film I can appreciate on many levels but it's lacking a decent hook and a good dollop of excitement.7.5/10 for the acting and production values.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Aviator Aviator Aviator!,"Finally got round to watching this movie and I gotta tell you I went into it with a whole different mindset. I was gobsmacked at how intrigued this movie kept me, the time flew by it was so good, DiCaprio is pure gold talent if that's a thing even if its not it is now, what an amazing watch, anytime I watch a movie Leonardo DiCaprio is in im never disappointed at all. The best thing with movies like this is that the story is just as good as the acting and especially when the story is based on truth. I think this movie was incredible and I definately recommend it to you!A movie about a pilot movie director, I wasn't sure at first but im glad I checked it out, it was definitely a movie worth checking off the list.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tedious at Times,"Despite the hype attached to this picture, the Motion Picture Academy made the right decision for once in awarding best picture to ""Million Dollar Baby"" and best director to Clint Eastwood. ""The Aviator"" is certainly cinematic. All the major roles are exceptionally well acted. The film's weakness lies in the direction and editing. The picture drags in a number of places, particularly in the scenes intended to show that Howard Hughes is one weird fellow. The idea could have been conveyed equally well with fewer scenes and considerably less footage. I have to wonder whether the movie would have been equally interesting if it were fiction instead of biography populated with figures like Hughes himself, Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Juan Trippe (who ran Pan Am), Senator Owen Brewster of Maine and Noah Dietrich, Hughes' principal aide, not to mention more minor figures (for purposes of the picture) like Jean Harlow, Louis B. Mayer, Errol Flynn. My guess is that it would not have been half as interesting as pure fiction. Part of the charm is watching actors like DiCaprio, Blanchette, Beckinsale, Baldwin, Alda, and Reilly impersonate real people that I personally remember. My bottom line: Martin Scorcese fumbled this by being overly preoccupied with the pictorial elements and insufficiently ruthless in the editing process.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the very great stories of new era,I remember watching this movie and I still remember feelings. It was like watching machine plant shown in a way that makes each screw fantastic.Director is a man who can make miracles. However cinematics in this movie makes the film speaking for itself.And choices. Choice of actors. Di Caprio definitely has a good agent. He selects his movies carefully. Each one is like a ribbon on his chest. No wrong moves.Better watch it....,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An excellent movie with an unusual storyline,"The Aviator, probably one of Martin Scorsese's most unlikeable works, tells the story of Howard Hughes, a man whose enormous wealth defined his passions and who gradually succumbed to the ravages of mental illness. The film masterfully depicts Hughes' life and his endless ambitions, and Scorsese's authorial directing style is palpable. Leonardo DiCaprio spectacularly portrays Hughes, but the outstanding performance belongs to Cate Blanchett as the implacable and energetic Katharine Hepburn. The film is three hours long, perhaps longer than it needs to be (especially the last hour, which probably should have been shortened a bit), but it's a small price to pay for such a fascinating look at such a fascinating life.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Take a pillow,"You'd better take a pillow. This film is so dull it's unreal. It goes from bore to bore. Yes, we knew Howard Hughes was a recluse. So they blame it all on his mother, very Freudian. The descent into madness is very quick, the whole ""hygiene"" plot isn't very well explained at all. I was just bored almost all the time. Even the plane sequences weren't particularly inspiring. basically it's the story of a rich kid left money by his parents and he decides to use it to make films and build planes. More power to him I say. I'd have liked to have seen more of Howard's life explored instead of just concentrating on the Hollywood bit. Jane Russell and Jean Harlow (played by the stunning Gwen Stefani who really looked amazing on screen) could have been used a lot more. Leonardo Di Caprio isn't very watchable at all as Howard Hughes, i think they hired him so the woman would flock in for his nude scenes. A very very very very very very very BORING film. Go see something else.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

No Favor to Hughes,"Say what you want about the old studio biopics that often turn up on cable channels. They were too often schmaltzy, shameless, and as historically accurate as a politician's memory. But at least they knew how to tell a story and make it interesting. On the other hand, The Aviator replaces story line with jumbled imagery, dialogue with rapid-fire editing, and a heavy-weight subject with a light-weight actor who gets serious by scowling and stamping his foot as any 12-year old might. Surely Hughes deserves better, I know the audience does. The moral is that no amount of fiddling with period detail or special effects can make up for a chaotic core. Shame on you, Martin Scorsese for lending your good name to this cinematic mess.",,Anonymous,Biography
It's entertaining yet something is missing,"Although this movie was very entertaining I felt that it was choppy, plodding in places and talky, talky, talky. Further, I feel that a more masculine and rugged actor should have been chosen to play Howard Hughes. Not that DiCaprios acting was bad, it wasn't, in fact it was very good. My opinion is that DiCaprio just isn't manly enough to realistically play Hughes. I thought that DiCaprio was miscast in Gangs of New York as well, but perfectly cast in Catch Me If You Can. Cate Blanchett is very clever as Kate Hepburn and Kate Beckinsale is wonderful as Ava Gardner. Alan Alda is a convincing arch rival and villain as Sen. Owen Brewster and although the flight scenes were fabulous it just wasn't enough. The movie is unquestionably good and cannot and should not be dismissed, but it left me feeling unfulfilled. It was close but just not quite good enough. I was entertained but disappointed. Scorsese has done better.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the Best Hollywood Movies of the Year,"In all honesty, it must be said that this film is not traditional Scorsese film-making. In comparison to his classics Raging Bull and GoodFellas, The Aviator pales in comparison. However, it must also be said that Scorsese's latest does not feel like the typical over-the-top gore fest that his previous films have felt like (2002's Gangs of New York). The Aviator is far better than Scorsese's lastaccomplishment but this is a step out of the ordinary for his usual work. Much like last years Seabiscuit, the era of the 1920s and 1930s is beautifully captured with stunning cinematography and impressive costume design. In technicalcategories this film will garner multiple Oscar nominations (if not win the coveted prize). Seeing it at a private screening at Los Angeles Center Studios onThursday night, I was quite impressed at the overall feel of the film. This is one of the best Hollywood movies based on Hollywood's golden age I have everseen. And with a running time of over 2 and a half hours, I felt like I wanted to see more. Sad to see, but that is one aspect that could have been approved.The film's ending (or lack thereof) does not exactly impress leaving theaudience at that certain point where you think the film is going to really take off. It doesn't. Perhaps it could be how engrossed I was with the first two and a half hours that ultimately left me wanting more. Aside from that, this is one of my top five favorite films of the year, and it is certainly worthy of all the nominations it can get. While it may not be a win that is far beyond due to mastermindScorsese, it certainly should give him a great chance up against such talents as Mike Nichols and Alexander Payne. With all technical aspects aside, the acting should certainly be equally commended. First off, Cate Blanchett instantly sold me as Katherine Hepburn, and in regards to her recent passing, I believe that the performance here is about as memorable as Katherine herself: a legend that will live forever in cinema. If Blanchett is ever again to be nominated for Best Actress, let this be the year. Equally impressive is the underrated LeonardoDiCaprio, who like in Catch Me If You Can, delivers a powerful performance as Howard Hughes. I can not imagine anyone else playing this role as well as hedid. As to the cast, with the fine talents of Alec Baldwin, the great John C. Reily, Ian Holm, Scorsese favorite Willem Dafoe, Jude Law (who seems to be in everymovie I have seen this season) and Kate Beckinsale it is so hard to go wrong. A tremendous ensemble, a beautiful film, and a magnificent memory. One of thebest films of the year and a worthy Best Picture contendor. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Made me a touch sad,"Oh, there is so much promise is this movie. A ripe subject matter, an esteemed director and a wonderful cast should be the formula for success, but the finished product, like Hughes' movies themselves, leaves a little to be desired.It is unfair, but inevitable, in my mind to compare a directors early works with his current ones. If The Aviator proves anything, it is that people change, grow, adapt, and try to keep doing what is most passionate to them. For me, I would have loved to see 1980 Scorcese tackle this project and do what he does best which is draw out the raw, gritty human emotion of the story. It's there in this story, but Scorcese chooses not to mine it, instead focusing on a personal love affair of the movies and movie system of his youth.It's hard to complain about a Scorcese film. He adeptly shows what he wants to show. The production is first rate and he gets fine performances from his actors, but the story he chooses to tell is not up to his best efforts.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scorsese and DiCaprio back on track,"'And the winner of this year's Academy Award for Best Director is.Martin Scorsese'Why not? After all, he has been nominated five times before. Adored by critics and hailed as one of this generations finest film helmers, Marty has yet to walk to the podium to accept his due.Ben Affleck has one. Eminem has one. So why not in the same year that saw Phil Mickelson finally whip his own demons and walk away with a Master's Championship, and the Boston Red Sox overcome the Curse of the Bambino, should Martin Scorsese not be able to put a lifetime of film-making into an honor that has him take home the coveted golden statuette.Martin's 2004 crack at the can comes courtesy of The Aviator, a film that chronicles the life of movie director and multi-millionaire aviator, Howard Hughes. For any of us that have seen an E! True Hollywood Story or A&E Biography on the eccentric Mr. Hughes, they would most remember his final years. He became a paranoid recluse that bordered on the insane.But Scorsese only dabbles in Hughes final years and the slow deterioration of this playboy's exile. Instead, he shows what a shrewd businessman and compulsive obsessive aviator Hughes was in his younger years and how he single handedly, due to either his genius or incredible stubbornness, didn't allow Pan Am to buy his Trans World Airlines to create a one-airline option for the American public.Playing the role as the anomalous Howard Hughes is Leonardo DiCarpio in his second collaboration with Scorsese in as many years (Gangs of New York). I have written for almost five years now how I have not understood the DiCarpio fascination. He was just OK in good films  Titanic, Catch Me If You Can  but gawd-awful in movies that he could have elevated  The Beach, The Man in The Iron Mask. Before The Aviator was even viewed for critics, DiCaprio was garnishing nominations as Best Actor and his salary intake based on one monster making film and countless teen magazines was just mind-blowing to me. Until now.As Howard, Leo does his best work to date and any non-nomination by the Academy would be robbery. This will be the role that defines DiCaprio. A role where he plays both a man with a vision and a child that locks himself in a room in self quarantine. As a naked Hughes in his red screening room, he drinks copious amounts of milk, lines up his bottles of urine and fends off an aggressive takeover bid by Pan Am's Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin). It is a scene upon which the succeeding chapters strongly rely and in the hands of a less talented actor, could have turned the movie into parody. But DiCaprio turns it into gold and although we are not talking about Tom Hanks type consistency yet, we definitely have seen a maturity that leads to as much more promise than say Gangs of New York did just one year ago.Clocking in at an unnecessary 169 minutes, the movie's first quarter focuses on the making of Hughes' film Hell's Angels from 1927 to 1930. The film was a visually stunning epic, which before production wrapped, buried three stunt men, was shot twice to incorporate the new innovation of sound in motion pictures and came in at a cost of almost $4 million. Sure that type of money might not even pay for Bruce Willis' baggage handler in today's economics, but back in 1930, it was almost 4 times the cost of the average big screen production. This lavish spending on a film that that would be almost impossible to recuperate, brings Noah Dietrich (always reliable John C. Reilly) into Hughes life as his financial voice of reason and head of Hughes' inherited tools manufacturing business. Together, these two would meet on screen throughout the years as Hughes would always be looking for money to fulfill his dreams while looking to Dietrich to find the money.After the opening of Hell's Angels, the movie begins to take a turn and follow the two loves of Hughes' life  aviation and women. In his aviation career, Hughes was a perfectionist that garnished grants from the government during wartime to build an airplane to better provide troops and equipment overseas. The plane, nicknamed the 'Spruce Goose' was completed after the war ended and was never used for its wartime intention. And as his empire grew, Hughes also started Trans World Airlines and began the quest of traveling to Europe and beyond. This would consume Hughes in his later years as conspirators in both rival airlines and the government tried desperately to dissipate his dreams.When it came to women, Hughes was labeled 'The World's Greatest Womanizer' back in the 1950's, but it was his love for Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) that the film reveals most prominently. They had a tumultuous relationship where fame and pressure would ultimately be their demise. But that didn't stop Hughes from putting a lovely woman on his arm each time he went out on the town. Hughes was attached to Ava Gardner and Jean Harlow and various times during his adult life and was the Scott Baio of their times.The last few chapters of the film deal with Hughes battle with government and his own internal demons as he edges into a world of insanity. This was an important footnote in the life of this public celebrity, but Scorsese probably draws it out 20 minutes more than is necessary.When the film is over, it is hard not to be overwhelmed with the contributions Hughes made to the future in both film-making and aviation. Without his battles with the government airlines like Southwest and Continental might never have ran a tarmac and he pushed the envelope with such violent or sexual in nature films as Scarface (1932) and The Outlaw (1941) that caused the MPAA to review its processes.The Aviator will lead the nominations parade throughout 2005. Scorsese, DiCaprio and Best Picture are all strong possibilities and rightfully so. The Aviator was a step back in the right direction for both director and lead actor and was one of the top 10 of 2005.www.gregsrants.com",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Probably the Best Hollywood Film of '04,"A true masterpiece of our time and an instant classic for Scorsese fans as well as lovers of all great cinema, The Aviator delivers on every level; from its incredibly convincing, yet not at all distracting, special effects to its engrossing story of triumph and insanity. This is a modern day Citizen Kane, with top notch acting from both leading actors, Cate Blanchett, with her inspired portrayal of Katharine Hepburn, as well as the incredibly talented and compelling DiCaprio who, with this role, graduates from mere movie star to bona-fide actor.

"What was missed, however small, was significant","The movie was awesome, fast tracked with energy oozing from the pores of Howard Hughes, and Katherine Hepburn role was an Oscar performance. But, a grand opportunity failed to appear, that being any of the women of the 1929 Air Race. The only movie cameo was Roscoe Turner with his pet lion. But then...I have written ""Amelia's Voice"" about that race and it will blow the screen away soon. There is another chance to see Amelia Earhart, Pancho Barnes, and Howard Huges, not in the NOW, but in time travel into the past. What the movie did touch upon was the early years after WWI and how pilots traded in their military records for stunt flying and barnstorming. My only wish was that The Aviator had had more about the fliers of that age.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Come Fly With Me in My Flying Machine.,"The life of reclusive mega-billionaire Howard Hughes (dynamite role for Leonardo DiCaprio) from his innovative film-making in Hollywood in the late-1920s to the post-World War II era where he had to legitimize his role in military aircraft aviation and governmental spending. His relationships with movie starlets (Jean Harlow, played by Gwen Stefani, Katharine Hepburn, played by Cate Blanchett, and Ava Gardner, played by Kate Beckinsale) and confrontations with bigwigs Alec Baldwin (running Pan Am Airlines) and Alan Alda (the senator who ended up bringing Hughes in front of the Congressional Committee) are imperative focal points in this tale. All this and Hughes' never-ending bout with an obsessive-compulsive/germophobia disorder are the major keys in director Martin Scorsese's ode to a highly complicated man and old-time California glitz. Wonderful turns galore (also by cameo performers Ian Holm, John C. Reilly, Willem Dafoe and Jude Law) and screenwriter John Logan's intelligent take on the material combine with all the aforementioned attributes to create a truly stunning modern-day epic that stands tall with all of Scorsese's earlier credits. With movies like this, the sky is truly the limit to its greatness. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Biography
Good film that could have been great,"Aviator is another Scorsese film that carries on a bit too long. Great performances turned in by Leonardo and a great supporting cast make this film thoroughly enjoyable. I just wish it could have been a little shorter as I found myself nodding off from time to time. Even if it meant cutting some of the great supporting performances, it would have helped the tempo. Creating a biographical film about such an enigmatic public figure is by no means an easy task to undertake, and the length doesn't overly detract from a very nice film.I definitely recommend any and all to see this film if you haven't already as it is a great study of one of this country's pioneers and the disease that ultimately cut his career short.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
needs more balance but still excellent,"I remember a lot of the press about the very eccentric Howard Hughes and also read a biography on him after he died.the film I think somewhat overemphasized his obsessive compulsive disorder and could have done more about his accomplishments. he was for example a pioneer in pushing for fuselage flush rivets which added immensely to airspeed for any plane.all the actors and actresses handled their roles very well Cate Blanchett although she does not resemble Hepburn in appearance she nailed down the unique voice right to a T. Kate Beckinsale who is proving to be very busy is even more beautiful than the original Ava Gardner.Decaprio is excellent as the movie mogul aviation real estate billionaire. no doubt he has indispensable insight into Hollywood intrigue.the film is about 3 hours and ends rather abruptly. then again, it only shows Hughes until just after the 1947 hearings. I am curious as to whether the filmmakers used transcripts from those hearings. I wouldn't be surprised; a lot of people underestimated Howard Hughes.20th century aviation owes a great deal to the adventurous spirit of Howard Hughes. perhaps we would have had even more rapid advance had he not been periodically put out of commission by ocd (feel free to do a google search on the topic). it was unfortunate for Mr Hughes that he was born too soon to take advantage of a spectrum of serotonin uptake inhibitors that would certainly greatly alleviated his suffering. I know what I'm talking about, I've had the condition since 1973 but it is nowhere remotely as bad as it used to be. I therefore truly sympathize with Howard Hughes; it is only fair that he made billions of dollars considering what he did for civil aviation and a plethora of other engineering fields.see the movie for insight into his life.I find it ironic that a man who had a great deal to do with the advancement of airplane designed passed away in one while it was in flight to the hospital in his home state of Texas.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Accolades to DiCapprio and Blanchett,"Just saw this on the Big Screen at the Maui Arts and Cultural Center First Light Film Festival. Can't wait to tell my friends about it. I've always known Leonardo was more than a pretty face. This guy can really act. It's about time that he receives the accolades due to him. He has paid his dues with this one. Cate Blanchett was stunning as well as convincing in her role as Kathrine Hepburn. The costumes were breath taking, the sets were impeccable in detail. Scorcesse doesn't scrimp on the budget for these elements. I found the story a little confusing in the opening scenes. It did jump around a bit but Leonardo held it together with his talent for not skipping a beat in the dialogue. With a life story as massive as Howard Hughes, it is impossible to do much of anything except skim over the highlights. One of the things a movie does is generate interest in the subject matter. It definitely does that....or I wouldn't be on this site. I saw Ray, and Jamie Foxx did an impressive impersonation. The comparison of acting vs. impersonations is evident in these two roles. Based on that theory alone, I would vote DiCaprio over Foxx. Fine line yes, and both bios are good.....I'm just glad I'm not a member of the Academy. Finding Neverland shows Friday night. That will probably put me over the top.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Holy Cow,"Normally when I see a movie I will tell myself ""wow, such and such and actor is really good at that part"" ... this time, no. While watching ""The Aviator"" I saw performances that transcended the roles that they were playing. Leonardo Di Caprio WAS Howard Hughes: I lost track of the fact that he was an actor and not Mr. Hughes himself. I have never seen OCD played out so well --- and I see it every day in a member of my family. Cate Blanchett WAS Katherine Hepburn --- she had come back to life in that theatre and on that screen in no better tribute than could be imagined. They both happened to be in a movie on the screen in front of me and playing parts... and blew me away. I felt that I was watching a newsreel at times --- it was so REAL it was spooky with the casting and the costumes. (A9lthough if you blink you will miss Gwen Stefani!)Is the movie genius? Maybe.

What I've only briefly read in book paragraphs about Hughes is compellingly elaborated by director Scorsese and scriptwriter John Logan. It's also solid, grand entertainment, not only for an aviationophile, which I feared at first. Lavish production of visuals (that crash scene is just stunning!) and time era feel, plus a great cast with Di Caprio in fine form, Blanchett a memorably cartoonish Hepburn, and finally a perfect Alda as senator Brewster.

"If 2004 has a must see film, this is it.","As an aviation buff (and historian) I went in to the theater today to see The Aviator with a mixed bag of reservations, mostly surrounding the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio as the legendary Howard Hughes. Was I every surprised and impressed at his portrayal of the famed aviator; he was in a word, mesmerizing.I'm not sure what movie the people here who are complaining about Mr. DiCaprio or the movie's almost three hours running time, but he seemed to capture the essence of the Hughes character completely with his portrayal and while I could see where at least 10 minutes could have been cut, which would have resulted in an even better picture, not once did I think that The Aviator dragged in any way.The transition in color, while something of a gimmick, worked for me. In watching the movie and now reviewing it in my mind as I write this, I compare it to two other epics, one obvious, one not; Tucker and Das Boat. The similarities between Tucker and The Aviator are obvious and I won't waste the space here as both tell the stories of misunderstood and eccentric industrialists with a sense of passion and compassion that is obvious. With Das Boat, one of my favorite movies, the comparison has more to do with the scope of the story and even a bit with the ballroom scenes. It's here where The Aviator falls a bit short in comparison. Maybe it's the substitution of CGI effects that leaves me a bit cold as it just seems less realistic than what Das Boat accomplished a generation ago with a proportionally smaller budget I'm sure.I'm going to leave commentary on Mr. Scorcese's direction to others here far more qualified except to say that the movie was well-paced. Of his films I would have to say that this falls in behind Goodfellas and Raging Bull and ahead of Taxi Driver, but that's just one man's opinion.Even with its flaws, this is a four stars out of four stars film, enjoyable and riveting at the same time, almost three hours of movie making magic.

This film may not be one of the best to come out this year in theaters, but it is a step up from recent big budget releases to hit this Christmas season. The film is definitely worth the money to be seen, and don't worry about the 3 hour run time, it will breeze on by in a flash.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Soars--at least most of the time,"It can't have been easy making an empathetic portrait of Howard Hughes. The man was abrasive, self-centered, and tragically burdened with obsessive-compulsive disorder--a person more likely to alienate than to attract. But that's exactly what director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio have done. They present Hughes in all his flawed glory, yet endear him to the audience so that we root for him in the end, and weep for the ignominious end we know will befall him.""The Aviator,"" however, is not concerned with Hughes' final days (though it hints liberally at them), but at the prime of his life, beginning in Jazz Age Hollywood and taking us through to the post-WWII era. The plot isn't so much a linear story as it is a study of several key points in Howard Hughes' life: his love for film, planes, and beautiful women, his struggles to establish his TWA as a competitor to PanAm Airlines, the infamous ""Spruce Goose,"" and more. Though the film's three-hour running time is occasionally felt, it is never regretted--Scorsese knows he has a fascinating subject to work with, and his captivating style and sure hand keep things going admirably.As Howard Hughes, DiCaprio gives one of the best lead performances of the year, ranking right up there with Jamie Foxx's tour-de-force turn as Ray Charles. Even in the film's somewhat slow opening, detailing the filming of Hughes' war-epic ""Hell's Angels,"" he establishes the character as an enthusiastic and determined individual, one for whom ""can't"" is the ultimate four-letter word and money is no object in the pursuit of his visions. Later, as Hughes' inner turmoil becomes more apparent, DiCaprio's furrowed brow and haunted eyes are both compelling and frightening. The sequence which foreshadows Hughes' reclusive final days is one of the most powerful I've seen in recent history.The film picks up considerably once Cate Blanchett strides onto the screen as brassy, witty Katherine Hepburn; she and DiCaprio have good chemistry as two larger-than-life people who make a complex emotional connection. She is a standout in an ensemble that is strong throughout--Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, John C. Reily, and Kate Beckinsale are among those Scorsese brings in to fill the corners of the screen with vibrant, effective performances.Though a bit turbulent at times, ""The Aviator"" is by an large a flight worth taking, an examination of a remarkable, unsettling man whose story stays with you long after the credits finish rolling.",,Anonymous,Biography
look at the Oscars...,"The best summary for this film can be provided by the prizes it won: lots and lots (editing, cinematography, costumes, even acting), but not for the best picture. Really, looking at it I continuously had the impression of grandeur, greatness, and that the director, the actors, the crew had made a terrific work... but for what? To narrate the life of a movie producer, billionaire, hypochondriac aviator, whom we have no reason to like. Surely Di Caprio is a great guy, and mesmerising probably for many, and so we end up liking the figure of Howard Hughes; but I think that the emptiness of this character *is* Di Caprio's ability to make us like him.Perhaps this film is just like Hughes' life: a great effort, put down with enormous ability, to build nothing.

DiCaprio put in an excellent performance, the direction was generally very fine indeed, and the effects were almost perfect (I say ""almost"" because, when the Hercules carrier took off in the end, it was very obviously computer generated). The aviation scenes were absolutely spectacular. All in all an engrossing and pleasant old-fashioned epic which, in my opinion, deserves an 8 out of 10 rating.Cate Blanchett's Katherine Hepburn was perhaps a little over-acted, but it doesn't matter, because the entertainment value of the role was so great. In the end, she did come across as convincing.Kate Beckinsale's Ava Gardner had a smaller role, which was a pity. She obviously became very intimate with Hughes, and in the movie we never really saw the two get to know each other. There was just a cut to a point when they were well into an established relationship. That was a little disappointing to me, because I really would have liked to see a larger role for Beckinsale. I think this role was one of her best yet. There was much more *character* in the Ava Gardner part than in any other role Beckinsale has had yet. Such fire in her eyes and expressions! (And, on a costuming note, what a stunning blue and red dress she wore in the scene where she helped Hughes recuperate from his solitary isolation!)Returning to the story, the last part of the movie seemed a little unfinished to me. The hearing scenes with Hughes being questioned by the senator and upstaging him were good, but we weren't really shown the full consequences of it. I wanted to see more of the aftermath. Also, the whole thing with Hughes' neurotic disorder was never really commented on; never explained or analyzed. Sure, we saw the childhood scenes that must have started it, but why was there no medical interlude of any kind?So, all things considered, not quite a perfect movie, but one I was fully engaged in and entertained by. That in itself is a rarity with new movies. I do hope The Aviator wins the Oscar for Best Movie. If you ask me, this is the kind of thing Scorsese should be doing, rather than all that boring and foul-mouthed mafia stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best Movie I've Seen In A Long Time,"I've been very excited about seeing The Aviator for quite a while, and today I finally got the chance to do so! Its the best movie of 2004, no doubt about it! Its simply brilliant! Everything about it was great, the cast, costumes, sets, just everything.Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance so far. He does a fabulous job as Howard Hughes, his performance is intense, and mature, proving that he has enormous talent. He has definitely proved that he is one of Amercias greatest actors. He really nails the role, and even puts thought into the smallest details. He deserves an Oscar for his wonderful performance.Cate Blanchett gives a simply marvelous performance as the legendary Katharine Hepburn. Her performance is not an imitation, you really believe that she is Katharine Hepburn for 3 hours. When I first heard that Cate Blanchett was going to play Katharine (one of my favorite actress's) I was very skeptical, thinking that she looked nothing like Kate. I was wrong,very very wrong, she doesn't look that much like Katharine but she masters her mannerisms and voice, and is totally believable. She and Leo have great chemistry together as well. I have no doubt in my mind that she will win an Oscar, she is more than deserving.Kate Beckinsale also does a great job playing the beautiful Ava Gardner, who has a very love/hate relationship with Hughes. She comes and goes in the film, but when she is there, she does a wonderful job. She does a wonderful job of portraying a woman who sometimes hates, but ultimately loves Howard.Scorsese is one of the best directors today and he too deserves Oscar gold. Despite the films 3 hours, it never once drags, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The movie should and hopefully will win the Best Picture Oscar. I went into the theater today hoping for a great movie, but the Aviator isn't just a great movie, its a masterpiece",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Why Do I Want To Give This An 8?,"The Aviator is a good film. Scorsese and Leo team up this time, for a tale of movie making, womanizing, and living the dream.The story of Howard Hughes is an interesting one, mixed into the Hollywood scene and general business dealings. It's fun to see the rise of man, and also his fall. It's haunting towards the end, when you see of what could really become of someone who had it all at one point in his life.There are also memorable portrayals by Alec Baldwin and Cate Blanchett.7 Stars",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
King Leo...,"i originally did not want to go see this movie, but on a cold December (20th) Monday, off we went. at one point in time, i was totally infatuated with Howard Hughes (HH), & read everything i could about his life. so, i assumed the movie would be not only full of distortions, but also ""thought"" Leo was a terrible choice.1st, the bad news, Scorsese did the requisite surface research, but, just did not seem able to capture the magic of Hughes's essence. the ""rosebud"" theory re: HH's slide into germ madness via his mother's influence was never really explored accurately, just little bits & pieces, haphazardly strung together at different parts of the movie, that come across as a convenient lazy way to attempt to explain Hughes inner depths & subsequent slide. in fact, it was both his mother & relatives who re-inforced his awareness of germ spread, as well as the premature deaths of both his parents, the smothering of his mother, & other personality-forming events from his 1st 18 yrs that may have equally contributed to his later madness. no one really knows. Scorsese's appearance of 1sthand knowledge of HH's relationships, scenes, & conversations with Hepburn & Ava appears to be too much artistic interpretation of HH's Hollywood yrs. Scorsese seems to accept too much of the hearsay as gospel & the relationships come off as affectations of the director, unfortunately. movie biographies are incredibly difficult to bring to the screen, & to bring someone as complicated & larger-than-life as HH's early yrs to the screen is particularly difficult. its too bad, Scorsese is not as attuned as this story demands, but given the amazingly difficult subject matter, he ""sort of"" tells the story within a framework that gets ""close, but only 1/2 a cigar"".on the positive side, i must ""eat my hat"" & anyone else's who does NOT think that Leo was not an inspired choice! he was perfect! he was sublime! just as i became an early believer in Brad Pitt's terrific acting, i am now a believer in Leo's! he no longer has to prove himself. to say he ""nailed"" HH would be an amazing understatement. it was eerie watching his performance - he WAS HH. from his boyish good looks, just as HH's was, to his appearance before the congressional committee, to taking up the controls of the ""spruce goose"", he actually made you feel as if HH had come back to star in this film. an earlier review could not have been more wrong. anyone who has taken the trouble to read & view photos from these several periods in HH's life would HAVE to agree there is a remarkable similarity. capturing HH's obsession with the aerial scenes in ""hell's angels"", Russell's bra n ""the outlaw"", the aviation speed records, the undertaking of building the largest aircraft ever, the appearance before the congressional committee, the treatment of subordinates, the phobias, the obsession with details was sublime. as i said above, Scorsese does get close. maybe it was just too difficult.in conclusion, with someone as brilliant, as complicated, as mad, as HH; it is virtually impossible to capture these nuances & transfer to the screen. ""Hollywood"" always errs in translation, then excuses itself for failing by falling back on the tried & true ""entertainment for entertainment's sake"", a la Oliver Stone unfortunate falsehoods wrapped in sincerity. on the other hand, no one should ever go to the movies expecting the truth. so therefore, Hollywood's ultimate contribution is story telling. knowing this, ""the aviator"" could have been made somewhat more interesting, less boring, & certainly shorter. true, it was too long, true, a number of scenes were unnecessarily long, as many in the audience expressed leaving the theatre. however, i did not share that sentiment. why? because, in spite of everything i have said, this was a good ""movie""! i believe Leo nailed the role better than Scorsese's direction, & a long movie was necessary to tell the story. wishing for a more factual rendition is probably too far beyond the talents that believe they have more talent than they actually have. if i had not been so mesmerized by Leo's unbelievable performance, this movie would not have been as entertaining. BUT, due to Leo's performance, the movie does take on life, & makes you believe what you're watching IS the early period of Hughes's life. the theory that the story is always the main feature is mostly a truism; however, every once in a while, an actor comes along that is able to ""lift up"" an endeavor, & we should all be appreciative.as for HH, on the whole it was a sad life; however, for his 1st 45-47 yrs, he was a truly brilliant American pioneer who captured the public's imagination with his derring-do, warts & all! although the ""warts"" did not surface til later. one can say whatever they want, but his 1st 47 yrs could not have been more exciting or more magnetic.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
wow a 7.6 rating,"I thought the movie was all right. It was to long, they could have cut out most of the scenes about Hughes losing his mind, personally a I knew he was crazy before I went to see it so I didn't think they had to waste an hour and a half on it. But it was just a movie so it doesn't really matter, the thing that bothers me is that IMDb gives it a 7.6 and the the people that voted for it gave it a 7.6 this is one of the few movies on here that gets the rating people vote for.

"""The Aviator"" will fly forever.","Okay, so ""Million Dollar Baby"" was great, but I still say that ""The Aviator"" should have won Best Picture (especially since Martin Scorsese has never won an Oscar). The story of Howard Hughes' (Leonardo DiCaprio) Hollywood years, the movie shows his determination to make ""Hell's Angels"" at any cost, his love affair with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), his persecution by PanAm CEO Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) and Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), and finally his experience with the Spruce Goose. And we can clearly see how Hughes was getting germ-phobic during these years.Among other things, it's good to see DiCaprio breaking away from the ""Titanic"" mold. Further kudos to him for taking on a role as great as this one. ""The Aviator"" isn't one of those epics that prides itself only on visuals while lacking any real plot; it's all about the story (but then again, Martin Scorsese's movies always have real plots). Like ""Gangs of New York"", it looks at something that so many people probably wouldn't usually think of.All in all, kudos to everyone who participated in this movie. Like I said, it deserved Best Picture. Oh well, at least it took home more Oscars than ""Million Dollar Baby"".",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
So close...,"Scorsese for me has always been one of those directors capable of bringing together actors of all different backgrounds and character and working them into a story effortlessly. His grasp of direction is usually flawless, artistic but always controlled. Yet he has never, again for me, produced a single piece of work I would call complete despite some fantastic performances from various actors.This is yet another in the long list of 'so close'.The film is good, great by many standards. But the story is weak, even if the central character is engrossing (and Di Caprio - who hasn't had a good role since Gilbert Grape - shows at last some of his talent by giving a great performance) and the supporting cast so strong. It just isn't carried anywhere (few biopics ever are though, ""Chaplin"" really is the only one that springs to mind).I do recommend it, I rate it highly enough to give it a 7 and the closing half an hour is great - but there's no ending to speak of.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Slick & modern but animation effects were over the top.,"Today we saw The Aviator, in a full house. I liked it. I knew it would be long, though I did not warn my wife about that or she would not have gone (don't tell). The story moves right along for the most part - - the cutting is very good (as expected) but I feel Mr. Scorsese could have lost 15 or 20 minutes easily, with no loss of story. I also appreciate the reluctance to do so. I am, however, a little frayed with overly used digital special effects, and I do wonder how an old school Scorsese-type would be persuaded to choose this path during the storyboard process. I feel we are now crossing the line, with directors choosing this method over other available effects. The process is just not 100% right. The impossible ""camera"" angles are distracting (to my taste, irritating), violating all sorts of physics laws which causes an observant person to instantly question the process of placing animations in serious films, and it therefore becomes a dead giveaway: he knows he is viewing a cartoon. It reminds me of the early days of S-T-E-R-E-O, very few younger people would understand this concept. I think James Cameron gets it but who knows for sure. Digital animations were probably required for this; I am suggesting that some moderation of it and additional use of models might make sense.This would be my prime criticism then, that the effects are in your face; they are anything but subtle in certain scenes. This was true with the other film I saw this weekend (The Flight of The Phoenix), there's relatively little in the way of special effects differences between them. I am witnessing this on an increasing level. All that said, The Aviator visuals are nonetheless impressive (some great plane crashes), and the storytelling, though very good, is artsy. I give the effort a must-see, on balance. This film looks very modern but handles the period feel with brilliance; it is indeed slick. The score and adaptations (Howard Shore) are fitting but not something I'd want to own beyond a possible DVD of the film itself, later on. And you have this: after seeing the film, there is little doubt in your mind who Hughes was, or what sorts of things cranked his gear. -- Don Forbes",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scorsese's Biopic Has the Style but Not the Heart,"Martin Scorsese's biopic about the rise and fall of eccentric entrepreneur Howard Hughes has energy to spare -- indeed, it barely pauses for breath -- but it remains a somewhat unengaging piece of cinema anyway. It's technically accomplished, but cold and lacking in heart.Leonardo DiCaprio played Hughes and gave audiences the first indication that he was capable of a mature film career after ""Titanic."" Cate Blanchett steals every scene she's in as Katharine Hepburn in a performance that manages to be a dead ringer for the real thing without being a mere impersonation. And Alan Alda is deliciously villainous as a corrupt senator. Other casting -- like Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner(!?) and Jude Law as Errol Flynn -- works less well.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
It worked for me,"This movie was more than I expected, particularly from Lenonardo DiCaprio. It's taken me a while to warm to him as a serious actor in adult roles but I think he's grown a lot in the past few years. I thought he inhabited Hughes' character quite well but that may be because I don't expect actors in biopics to do impersonations. Impersonation is what some people do if they can't act. An even better example is Cate Blanchett's Katharine Hepburn. I think she nailed the character squarely but perhaps some people might disagree because they've been numbed by Martin Short's palsy voiced rendition.Interesting to note that this is Martin Scorsese's first FX heavy movie so I'll gladly overlook a few technical gaffes (sorry, but I'm an aviation buff) but I'm glad to see that the effects didn't overwhelm the characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Must Watch: Caprio & Blanchett have done a great Job!,"Plot Outline: The movie traces the life of millionaire movie mogul and aviator Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) from his late teens to his early forties. Set in the 1930's and 40's, the movie depicts the protagonist's mindset as he romances Hollywood's babes Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and his wild planes with equal zest.Comment: Scorsese makes a great effort to portray a crazy genius in the best possible way anyone could. Although a lot of my friends who've seen this movie say that 'emotion' is missing in this movie in a big way, I prefer to say that Hughes was a character about whom there is very little in the public domain, especially about his childhood and old-age. Further, it is extremely difficult to portray someone's thought process, something as wild as Hughes' with accuracy and emotion. I would say that, within the given constraints, Scorsese has made his best.The Five Oscars that the movie got are really well deserved. In fact, I would say that Aviator deserved better than Million Dollar Baby. By saying this, I mean that Underdog-winner concepts have always struck the sentimental chord. It would be pertinent to recollect the success of movies such as Seabiscuit, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, etc. Caprio has rendered a brilliant performance which has been under-rated by many. Other stars did a great job too. Blanchett had the meatiest role of all.Rating: 4.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hughes released from his padded room,"For most of my adult life Howard Hughes was a cartoon figure: the endlessly lampooned, reclusive, phobic multi-millionaire. What little I knew of the back story only deepened the caricature -- the Spruce Goose, the Russell bra, the Hollywood romances. So it was a delightful surprise to find this blockbuster giving me a glimmer of a real human being, talented wunderkind, supremely creative, paranoid, loyal, mentally ill. DiCaprio as Hughes and Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn were both stunning -- sure Oscar nominees I think. The special effects were beyond what I needed, but I loved the sense of high-speed parallel lives of the pioneer aviator, the empire builder tackling movie production, aircraft design, and an international air line simultaneously, the relentless womanizer lost without a woman, the obsessive-compulsive matching egos with the mighty of Hollywood, Washington, and Wall Street, as he is drawn deeper into the vortex of his illness.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Little more than riveting eye candy....but the ride is enjoyable,"Martin Scorcese delves into the mastery, ego, and madness of oil, tool, cinema, and aviation magnate Howard Hughes and comes away once again (without as much blood spattering and violence) with an unspectacular but pretty period piece, best described as riveting eye candy. ""The Aviator"" is every bit as visually stunning and devoid of substance as ""Gangs of New York"". The cast, however, tries really hard to capture the mood of the era and the persistent force that Howard Hughes became to a generation that just preceded and endured the Second World War.I am no fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I must give him credit for trying hard to capture a personality in this film. He looks way too young to be Hughes (though his age at filming was similar to the age of the character he portrays) but he gives his all in his attempt (and it's a great try) to encapsulate the hardheaded ego of Hughes, a man who refused failure and closeness simultaneously during his troubled lifetime. Cate Blanchett (who should still be publicly flogged for filming ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"") perhaps does the best long-form impersonation of a famous public figure in the history of film, and I mean that sincerely. We will never know the full vim (and vinegar) of Katherine Hepburn's private life because we could never see it. We have seen her characterizations on film, however. Cate captures, in her performance, a stunning replica of Hepburn's on-screen persona in what could have been the real role of Hepburn's life had she been able do it ( that is, to portray herself in an autobiographical role).The rest of the cast are dressed up for and act as period 1930s and 1940s personalities of the day. Even Alan Alda, who is not always much more than Hawkeye Pierce in any role he has ever done, is pretty convincing as the conniving Maine Senator Brewster.I thought the Dicaprio scenes of madness were a bit overdone (we got the point early in the film) but the cinematography and general feel of the picture were fine other than that.This is no Scorcese classic. However, the dude knows how to cash in on ""nice"" films. I am sure his more than ample retirement fund will be supplemented by the box office for this number.If you want to laugh, cry (well not really), and kiss 10 bucks goodbye on a feel-good piece of post-art-deco-and-slightly-more-than-pap theater, then by all means, go see this. If ""The Aviator"" wins Best Picture, just realize that this has been very unspectacular year in cinema (unless of course you actually think anything by Michael Moore could be loosely considered cinema, then, of course, you need a red room just like Mr. Hughes).For those of you who think all I do is hack bad films, you have been disappointed. Well not completely...Here is the oddest sequence in this film. Leonard DiCaprio, a 31-year-old actor, looking younger than a 25-year-old Howard Hughes would have looked at the opening of his 1930 film ""Hell's Angels"" is arm-in-arm with 35-year-old (I have read she is actually 40) pseudo-teen-slut songstress Gwen Stefani attempting to portray a 19-YEAR-OLD Jean Harlow.In 50 years, there will be a film on the life of Gwen Stefani called ""Tragic Kingdom"". In it, she will be found in a sealed room covered with red padded walls and rolling on the floor while listening to ""I'm Just a Girl"" or ""Spiderwebs"". The pounding of her fists on the floor will be peppered with her mumbling ""Take a chance you stupid ho!; Take a chance you stupid ho!"" The basic story of the movie will be how a troubled teen woman makes it from 16 to menopause without ever having lived a second of her life as a mature adult.Note to Hollywood...don't take that chance, not even with another actress' ""million-dollar contract"". A 40-year-old playing a 19-year-old? 19-year-olds (other than Janis Joplin) never have facial lines. Come on now; you've got to be kidding me.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
""" Genius?  What are the limits of Insanity ? ""","John Logan wrote the script for this film study of the late Howard Hughes. Under the skillful direction of Martin Scorsese, this movie is thereafter called "" The Aviator. "" It is the bio-Pic of one of the wealthiest, controversial, influential and certainly most flamboyant magnate of the 30's, 40's and 50s'. The son of an oil industrialist who left him an oil and drill bit company which he further expanded into a huge fortune, he further managed to increase its' holdings many times. Later, Howard Hughes became synonymous with early movies which challenged the Hays Code and brought America such stars as Jane Russel. During the same span of years, Hughes became afflicted with a debilitating ailment called O.C.D. or Osbessive Compulsive Disorder. However, his superior efforts also brought him world recognition as well as disastrous influence over many who saw him as a man out of control and a disturbing paranoid mania for cleanliness and perfection. In this film, the cast which features, Leonardo DiCaprio, is superior as he plays the eccentric Howard Hughes, with Cate Blanchett doing a superb job as Katharine Hepburn. Other cast members include Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm and Jude Law. The movie is a fast paced ride from Boyhood to reclusive tycoon and each triumph is matched only by the equally strange behaviors which find him isolated in small hotel room afflicted by Allodynia.

"Scorsese goes into the spotlight with a deep psychological work around the legendary Howard Hughes, in a meticulous work in technical aspects, script and great performances","The film is a retelling of the life of the eccentric aviator and self-taught engineer, who became a millionaire very early after losing his father, a tycoon who worked in the oil industry. At the age of 18 he was already included in the list of the richest in the United States. Over time, he also gained space in film productions - this amid the transition from silent films to talking films. So much so that one of the events portrayed is his engagement with the production Hell's Angels (1930), his homage to the US army which, in addition to being very expensive at the time, took three years to be released, due to the need to transform it into a talkie.The fact is that Hughes became something of a ""myth"" in his time. Any projects that gained his attention were done with audacity, as he was not afraid to take risks, especially when it came to money. In addition to cinema, he gained much prominence with his various records flying aircraft - at a time when flying above the atmosphere was considered a brave act, if not insanity. With planes that were designed by his own team of engineers, he broke the round-the-world record in 1938, and was one of the first to have the balls to build larger, larger-capacity planes similar to those that fly through the sky today.John Logan's script cuts across this man's life from the 1920s to the 1940s, the most productive time of his life. After a brief prologue that shows the origin of his hypochondria, we are thrown into the middle of recording Anjos do Inferno. The overproduction took two years to be made and cost 4 million dollars, an absurdity for the time. Mainly because it was completely independent. There were excesses, of course, like using 26 cameras to film an aerial sequence, or waiting months to re-record it, because I needed clouds in the sky. But, seeking perfection was also part of the madness of the character, developed by Leonardo DiCaprio. Not by chance, many point out as being the role that deserved to have given him his first Oscar. DiCaprio gives Howard Hughes a perfect tone, extremely careful in the small details, mainly in his hypochondriacally crises. The scene in a bathroom, for example, where he washes his hands with his own soap, uses a clean towel and waits for someone to open the door so he can leave without touching the doorknob is amazing.Howard Hughes is troubled, contradictory. It is strange to see someone who dares to pilot a machine with uncertain functioning, at 400 km/h, and, at the same time, be afraid/afraid to open a door by touching the handle because of bacteria (germ phobia). Paranoid. That little word sums up Hughes. Or rather, paranoid genius. At the same time that he imagines models of planes super advanced in time, his paranoia about cleanliness consumes him. Scorsese makes an interesting shot during the film: while Hughes is making out with a woman, and caressing her body, the scene changes completely to the construction area of the new silver plane in which he runs his hand over the body, with the same pleasure that seems to feel when being with the woman. Passion. When you do something with passion, everything seems easy. Howard Hughes was a guy passionate about aviation, and he made sure to achieve success in his work. For this he was considered a man ahead of his time.The only place Hughes seemed to feel safe was in the air. It was not by chance that he called himself ""The Aviator"". It was his biggest passion, even when he was at the height of his romance with Katharine Hepburn, that was their code, their refuge, the way she calmed him down after some crisis or problem. A kind of pact too, which at the same time brought them closer, ended up pushing them apart. An interesting contrast is when she takes him to lunch at the Hepburn family home. The characterization of her own eccentricity, the way he is out of place, the modification of her posture, the truncated conversations, all create an instigating caricature that shows a little of what she had warned him about when he started to be famous. ""We are strange people; we can't let them reveal our intimacy or we scare the public."" And that was one of the missions of the agents closest to Howard Hughes, to keep his eccentricities and troubles behind four walls to preserve his image and his business.Known for being extremely perfectionist, director Martin Scorsese takes care that the film shows the details of ""The Aviator's life. Even though it is quite long, with almost three hours, the film is engaging and does not become tiring, after all there is a lot of history to be told. Throughout his life, Howard Hughes directed and produced feature films, created and piloted planes, fought with one of the largest aviation companies at the time (which monopolized international flights), among other accomplishments, all of this in the midst of his personal crises. Despite not showing more emphasis on his crazy side, the parts that appear already do the trick. John Logan's script is skillful in dealing with different periods of Hughes' life without sounding episodic and in humanizing him, the ambitious spirit and all the character's vitality are essential to the work. For before being an obsessive, Hughes was a visionary.The technical aspects of ""The Aviator"" are also dazzling: a perfect recreation of the period, which revives the golden period of Hollywood, with a careful art direction, an impressive costume design and a studied photography. The special effects are a case in point, providing scenes that leave anyone with their jaws dropping (the plane crash sequence remains vivid in the viewer's memory even after the end of the session).The film is not only centered on DiCaprio and Scorsese, there are many supporting actors in it (even if most of them are wasted), such as the beautiful Kate Beckinsale, who plays Ava Gardner and the talented Cate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn. Both are Hughes' romantic partners. Some have very small stakes such as Jude Law (Errol Flynn), Gwen Stefani (vocalist of No Doubt, as Jean Harlow) and Alec Baldwin (Juan Trippe, owner of Pan Am airline). There's also Hughes' right-hand man, the devoted Noah Dietrich, played by John C. Reilly. DiCaprio carries the film based on his talent (not that this is a negative point, but stars like these could have been better used).Many say """"The Aviator"""" is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece. In the biopic of tycoon Howard Hughes, the American director - and the adjective is fundamental - portrays in a poignant and violent way the atrocious loneliness that befalls dreamers, men on the margins, different, who dare and who take risks in the utopian quest for unattainable greatness. Through film, women and aviation, Hughes sets out on the hunt for both perfection and acceptance and security (but on his own terms) within a society that, while it needs him to move forward, fears him. For the aggressive and innovative posture, he presents: a tragic character, as he is aware of the impossibility of adapting to the world around him, Scorsese's anti-hero is condemned to live in the isolation of his obsessive and paranoid mind.However, instead of dwelling on the protagonist's psychological density, as in Taxi Driver or Raging Bull, the filmmaker privileges the surface, radicalizing the narrative fresco already seen in Gangs of New York, in which the accumulation of events involving the young tycoon serves to express an amalgamation of ideas about a romantic, visionary and enterprising America, which ends up being digested, on the way to the future, by monopolistic commercial practices, by the corrupt state leadership and by the supremacy of large corporations. Scorsese bets, in ""The Aviator"", on the omnipresence of Howard Hughes, so that there is no shot in which Leonardo Di Caprio (extraordinary) does not appear. In the non-linear narrative of the film (albeit temporally ordered), the filmmaker abandons the much-celebrated psychological deepening of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, which contains the rancidity of the simplistic relationship between cause and effect, to adopt the free juxtaposition, on the surface, of the multiplicity of themes - which do not stem from one another, but which intertwine and interpenetrate one another -, which provide the dramatic construction of the anti-hero.As a consequence of the mounted fresco, in which independent parts join together to form the complete panel, Martin Scorsese annuls the distinction between figure and background, between character and context: Hughes is America, or at least the USA of free enterprise, free competition, speed, immoderate outbursts, youth, conquest adventures, innovation and pioneering spirit. With the birth, in the post-Second World War, of the corporate nation, the moment arrives for the independent producer who challenges the Hollywood studio system, for the passionate person who designs his own aircraft, to withdraw from the battlefield, without first facing the circus set up by Brewster, on the congressional committee, to impeach him (anticipating the witch hunt of McCarthyism), or to get the Hercules, the biggest plane on the planet, to take off, shutting the mouths of critics, despite all the illnesses that already afflict.The film does not end in the great decline of its protagonist's career, but thirty years before the death of this unique character. The spectator, however, knows nothing of this, but what matters is not knowing, but feeling. Martin Scorsese doesn't need to end his work by narrating destiny. The audience senses where the years will go.""The Aviator"" lifts Scorsese back into the spotlight with a deep psychological work around the legendary Howard Hughes and everything that bypassed his life. Join the beautiful composition of the story with good effects, an inspired Scorsese, a luxury never seen before in his work and a rhythm so unusual for Hollywood that the lack of climax becomes a defect to be overcome with time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting biopic,"As always, Scorsese did a good imitation of reality. A bit too long, but it was interesting, though it had some boring scenes. Leo's acting was great as always, Cate's performance was good too, but a little short for an oscar, but i don't know the other contenders performances. Nevertheless, it's a decent biography movie, I liked a lot how the character exited the cave and faced the truth, with style. Kudos!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
As grand an entertainment as we've come to expect from Scorsese.,"Scorsese knows how to mine the neuroses of his characters and in The Aviator he has one of his richest subjects for this purpose. DiCaprio's evolving characterization from the young to the older, moustached Hughes who some of us older folks remember especially well, rightfully deserves high praise. Like so many biographies, this was not intended to be a documentary, I'm sure, but a reflection of the idiosyncrasies that made Hughes stand out like the battleships of the sky he conceived and built. Some of the other reviewers here have suggested a comparison between Scorsese's Hughes and Welles's Kane, reflecting the same kind of explicit arrogance and power, and I agree. To those comments, I would like to add that the real Hearst wrote an enduring chapter in American journalism, just as Hughes's accomplishments in the fields of aviation and, particularly notable at his death, medical research, endures for us far beyond the public image of the mentally ill reclusive. We love cinema characters overflowing with competing flaws and ideas of genius, and Scorsese has provided us with an enjoyable time in the theater and a period of long reflection afterward.Bravo Marty, again. I don't care if The Aviator doesn't match or beat his cinematic prowess in Raging Bull or Goodfellas; I only know that in an era of such motion picture mediocrity, it's a pleasure to see the Scorsese Team delight us with great direction, superlative editing as usual from Schoonmaker, and matchless cinematography by Richardson. No other director today knows how to make such a ""complete"" film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Very good movie, a surprise!","I saw this movie a long time ago(is three months a long time?Yes, if you want to remember all the details of a movie...), so I can't remember all the scenes, but I'll do my best. ""The Aviator"", it's a shame that this movie didn't win more Oscars, like Achieving in Directing, or something like that. Leonardo DiCaprio was THE big surprise. An excellent acting gave us the perfect view of Howard Hughes' world and it makes us understand his trauma. Of course that the astunig direction also plays a big role in the authenticity of the characters, because Martin Scorsese really knows how to visually tell a story.

Tadeo 38 claims Scorcese's lost something since ""Goodfellow's"" not ""Goodfella's"" did this ""Fellow"" even see Casino?????...Sorry, Dicaprio is superb he steals the show as Howard Hughes and not once did i feel that he lost the character, or did not do the film script justice.

Aviator Glides with near Greatness,"Can legendary Director Martin Scorsese ""score"" his long-awaited Best Director Oscar with his Howard Hughes bio ""The Aviator""? Most oddsmakers feel Marty will be sipping a few ""martynis"" after he receives his first golden boy at this year's Academy Awards. However, Scorsese has been the favorite before and left home empty-handed. For example: 1) The ""Taxi Driver"" oversight many felt was not ""fare"" 2) Many also felt that Academy voters were ""Bad Fellas"" for not awarding Marty the statuette for ""Good Fellas"" 3) Even others felt that the 2003 Academy Awards should have been renamed ""The Gong Show"" for not recognizing Scorsese for his ""Gang Show"" that is ""Gangs of New York"". However, I do think Scorsese will reach new Oscar heights for his spectacular & mesmerizing direction of ""The Aviator"". The bio film focuses on the legendary billionaire, aviator mogul, and Hollywood big wig that was Howard Hughes. ""The Aviator"" takes off with Hughes' relentless direction of ""Hell's Angels"" and ends with the Pan Am/TWA Senate Hearings. During its airtime, ""The Aviator"" exhibits: Hughes romances with Hollywood starlets, his aircraft obsessions, and speaking of obsessions: his obsessive compulsive disorders. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance as Howard Hughes was definitely worth a billion bucks. He portrayed Hughes as capricious, obsessive (of course), enterprising, focused, rigid, suave, and strenuous. Leo's work is one of the best of the year! Pero que ""Leo"" se va forma si no lo nominan para un Oscar. Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, one of Hughes' Hollywood conquests, was hypnotic. Blanchett's ""vowelistic"" vocal interpretation of Hepburn's infamous gab was definitely something to ""vowel, I mean, bow down to"". Hughes romanced Hepburn before she hooked up with Spencer Tracy. I guess the billionairo proved that he can ""have his Kate and eat it too"". Speaking of Hollywood starlets, Kate Beckinsale was a sight of comeliness as Ava Gardner. Ava Maria! She looked hot! Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Danny Huston, and the great John C. Reilly were competent ""aviator"" attendants as the supporting acting co-pilots of ""The Aviator"". The film's cinematography, art direction, and costume design were stellar and not in the ""just plane"" category. The only downfall of ""The Aviator"" was its overlong running time. This nearly three-hour film flight should have landed at the 2-hour runway. Still, it should be your priority not to miss the next theatre flight of ""The Aviator"". **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Episodic bio-pic never really adds up,"Over 2000 years ago Aristotle observed that a selection of true incidents from someone's life doesn't necessarily add up to an effective story. THE AVIATOR proves Aristotle's point.Here's a movie that takes a lot of really interesting people and makes them -- not very interesting. The weakness is mainly the superficial script, which covers Hughes the aviation pioneer (much of this is quite exciting), Hughes the Hollywood producer (this is sketchy and disjointed), Hughes the womanizer (sketchy and uninvolving), and Hughes the obsessive-compulsive eccentric -- but never quite succeeds in pulling all these elements into a persuasive whole.At the end of this very, very long film, I didn't really *feel* anything about Hughes, either positive or negative. He seems as cold and remote at the end as at the beginning and the last hour drags.What Scorcese needed was a screenplay that would make us care about Hughes -- either love him or hate him -- the way CITIZEN KANE does. But THE AVIATOR is no KANE. It tries to cover too much, and you never really know why some things were included and others omitted; the result is the incidents covered seem shallow, obvious, and quickly glossed-over.Still, there are a number of excellent scenes in the film. My favorite is Hughes' visit to Katherine Hepburn's family, where her relations -- as headstrong and self-involved as she is -- treat him with hilarious rudeness.I should confess I have a problem with DiCaprio: I have trouble accepting him as a grown-up. He always seems to me like a 14 year-old boy playing an adult in a junior High School play. He's a pretty good actor; he applies himself and he's quite talented. I don't know why that boyish thing bothers me, just as it did in TITANIC, where Kate Winslett seemed more like his aunt than his lover.Even Scorcese's period mise en scene fails to persuade. The sets and costumes are all so colorful, so squeaky-clean, they seem made for a musical comedy rather than a serious period drama. And Scorcese makes too many obvious choices, such as the movie Hughes watches that convinces him the public now wants sound films. Of course it's THE JAZZ SINGER.As in NEW YORK, NEW YORK, there's a ton of painstaking period detail, but it doesn't ring true. You don't feel you're really in the 1930s and 40s, any more than you believe Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. Cate Blanchett tries a little too hard as Katherine Hepburn, though it's basically an intelligent and effective performance. Her strenuous efforts to imitate Hepburn's well-known vocal mannerisms are distracting at times.So I can see why THE AVIATOR lit no fires either at the box office or at the Oscars. A huge amount of work and money went into a film that is frequently interesting, but finally not all that compelling.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fabulous film - Two hours and fifty minutes well spent!,"The critics panned it, the audiences stayed away, the Academy didn't give it it's due - all in all ""The Aviator"" was a theater-goer's disappointment all around. So maybe I'm a sucker for a beautiful period-piece or maybe I just don't know a stinker when I see it, but I say that ""The Aviator"" was a superb film that I will watch again & again.Scorsese has made some mediocre movies (Gangs of New York & New York, New York come to mind) but this isn't one of them. The casting was brilliant, the cinematography inspired (watch how certain scenes of different time-periods have a ""vintage"" cinematic look to them), the music fabulous and the acting spot-on. For those who thought DiCaprio was too ""baby-faced"" or too young to play Hughes, take a look at a few Hughes photographs from the 30's and you will see that he was not the more rugged looking fellow from after his near-fatal plane crash. The baby-face works here and lends even more to the realism that DiCaprio gives to his portrayal of HH.I was captivated by Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Kate Hepburn as well as Kate Beckinsale's portrayal of Ava Gardner. Both actresses did a bang-up job of giving their characters a panache and fire that would have been necessary to match them against such a formidable lover and opponent as Hughes was to these two paramours. I was disappointed, however, that there was no mention made of Hughes' well known bisexuality and his alleged connection to the murder of rumored lover David Bacon (of The Masked Marvel serial movie fame). This could have been a great side story and I feel it was an opportunity missed by the screenwriters & the director.All in all, this is a movie I will list in my personal top 20 and once I own the DVD will watch over & over just as I do Tombstone, Titanic, Malcolm X & Wyatt Earp. If you haven't seen it because of the negative comments here or those given by critics at it's release give ""The Aviator"" an opportunity to captivate you. If you've seen it but disliked it because it's not an ""action-packed-thriller"" watch it again and make note of the fabulous sets, the wonderful cinematography, the music and the dead-on portrayal of Hughes by Leonardo DiCaprio. And for heaven's sake if for nothing else watch it for the slick flying and aviation engineering history lesson.This film is definitely a winner in my book!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Martin Hughes,"Its OK, its a good movie but Scorsese's days in film making as we knew him to be seem to be well over. What we feel now towards this director is a lot of nostalgia. I mean there was this whole thing going on in making this film about him having the same relationship with Di Caprio as the electricity he had with De Niro back in the seventies when making Taxi Driver which is all a load of you know what. I felt this way about De Niro as soon as he left the gangster genre as we knew it. I was not impressed with 'Bringing out the dead' or 'Gangs of New York' all his recent stuff like I was with Taxi driver, Meanstreets, Goodfellas and last but not least Casino which I believe was his last masterpiece, except Kundun which I must admit was really something. Look The Aviator is definitely worth a watch because Howard Hughs was definitely a character worth exploring.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

An unusual film,"Howard Hughes makes an interesting choice of subject for Martin Scorsese. This is, as you would expect, beautifully filmed- the colouration process used throughout being of perhaps particular interest. Unfortunately for me, I just didn't buy it. It might just be that I am not a big fan of Leonardo Di Caprio- although he puts in (what I personally consider) a career-best performance in this film; or maybe it was an inability to engage fully with the subject- Howard Hughes is probably a somewhat obscure figure to most people nowadays, besides it is possibly difficult for most people to identify with a reclusive billionaire. Another point that can be made is that there are several continuity and factual errors throughout the film. Although this is not immediately obvious on first viewing, it leaves the impression that perhaps the film crew's attention was not as focused as it might have been during shooting, and this is certainly the impression that I was left with. In short, it's a good film, but certainly not one of Scorsese's best.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
GREAT acting!,"ONE of the things that impressed me about the acting is that Kate Hepburn actually looked and acted like Kate Hepburn, Jude Law was a great Errol Flynn, and I've never seen Leonardo do so well -- I've never seen Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin play such convincing villains -- The best scene of the movie was the confrontation between Alan Alda and Leonardo -- My heart just went out to see how he was harassed and hounded by government at the behest of his sworn enemy -- From the beginning of the movie, you could see what a genius he was in the area of aviation! The sets were great -- I loved all that old art deco, and using Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor scored for orchestra by Leopold Stokowski was a WONDERFUL touch -- I was impressed with the movie in every way -- a true joy to behold!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
gollllllllllllllllllllllly!!,"Along with Ray and Sideways, this was another masterpiece of 2004. It was well acted and very well written. Leonardo DiCaprio was insane as the plane wizard Howard Hughes. He had that s**t cracking to a T. Everything about his portrayal was perfect. In my opinion, I think he is tied with Jamie Foxx for the acting category because there were no flaws in his acting. It was completely smooth. Katherine Hepburn is proudly looking down on Cate Blanchett because of her portrayal of her. Blanchlett stole the first half of the movie. She was absolutely awesome. I liked how she screamed out ""Golly"" during the scene where they flew a plane together LOL. It was really great. Since when did Alan Alda from M.A.S.H turn into such an a**hole. I was hoping that Leo would win that battle at the end of the movie. Overall, The Aviator is one of the best flicks of 2004.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cate Blanchett shines,"Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is grand spectacle with a reverence for the nostalgic, set in simpler times. As a snapshot of Howard Hughes's life from 1927 to 1947, ""The Aviator"" is a portrait of a man of genius and unmatched innovation, and also a man debilitated by severe obsessive compulsive disorder and extreme depression. ""The Aviator"" has an amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, and a mesmerizing performance by Cate Blanchett, who seems to inhabit the role of Katherine Hepburn-- the love of Hughes's life. However, the one indelible image I have of the film is the scene in which Hughes is frozen in the men's restroom, because he can't make himself touch the door knob for fear of germs and contamination. Granted this was a time before obsessive compulsive disorder existed as a diagnosis. The scene is intended as a dramatic arc, distinguishing a tragic flaw in Hughes. However, for me it seemed overly indulgent, and was curious regarding the scene length. Much like most of the nearly 3 hour movie, this is an exercise in indulgence, and attention to detail that is only that. Scorsese's balance between Hughes's genius and his great suffering is good melodrama, but not very inspiring. I have a particular affinity for Howard Hughes the man. Had John Lone's (and Michael Mann's) story followed Hughes through the 1950's and beyond, the story would be even sadder. ""The Aviator"" illustrates the highs of genius, and the abyss of near insanity. This is an accurate depiction of an amazing man's life, but it is skewed toward the broken aspect. So just personally for me, it was frustrating to watch. To Scorsese's credit, one gets that he has immense compassion for Howard Hughes.Hughes' life sentence is established in the opening scene. Hughes's mother while bathing the young Hughes, tells him something that perhaps leads to his obsessive compulsive nature. Apparently he is incomplete in his relationship with his mother, and the story surrounding what she said.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A movie that shows you how creative Scorsese is at turning biographies into epic films,"A very, very, very good movie.... I can't describe the amount of fascination they felt in this movie....

It am not surprised at all that it has been nominated for 11 Oscars and i am sure the movie will great some of these. One Zero is for the ending, it was quite a surprise for me. I expected to see where did Howard's obsession with aviation take him.

A Biopic About a Very Brilliant But Very Disturbed Man,"Hollywood loves biopics and, judging from past and recent history, the more whacked-out the subject the more resources go into the film. It doesn't matter if the average moviegoer knows anything about the spotlighted character (as in ""A Brilliant Mind,"" how many knew about that Nobel Prize-winning genius?). Actually it may be an advantage to not sit there comparing recollected reality with silver screen confabulation.In any event I doubt many people under sixty know much about rich inventor-cum-movie producer and director Howard Hughes. Hughes shifted gears from a fulsome dose of Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder (OCD) to full-blown madness decades before death released him from an affluent but miserable life.Martin Scorsese is massively fascinated by Hughes and his sprawling film is a testament to the man's brilliance as well as his descent into tragically isolated insanity. Having cast Leonardo DiCaprio in the much overpraised ""Gangs of New York,"" he recruited this versatile actor, who owes his preeminence in Tinseltown to the runaway success of ""Titanic,"" to portray Hughes from his mid-1920s life as producer/director of the uber-over budget World War I aerial combat flick, ""Hell's Angels,"" to the late Forties.As portrayed by DiCaprio, Hughes was a driven perfectionist. Nothing wrong with that in a surgeon but with a movie production there's a time to wrap it up and Hughes took years to reach that point. His obsession with detail, well reflected by DiCaprio, was simply an early and useful mirror of his increasingly handicapping OCD.That movie's success brought gorgeous women flocking to his side but the most interesting liaison was with rising star Katharine Hepburn. Cate Blanchett inhabits Hepburn, a risky role when so many both remember the recently deceased icon and were mesmerized by her out-sized, bigger than life personality. Well Blanchett did it - no surprise. She inhaled Hepburn's clipped, staccato speech and her mannerisms, not all of which were always gentle or kind, even to loved ones. An Oscar nomination, I hope, will follow.Hughes, an experienced but often reckless pilot, germinated ideas for novel aircraft design and he had the sense, the judgment to recruit the best minds to translate his concepts into operational models. Much of ""The Aviator"" focuses on Hughes's drive to produce the fastest planes and the biggest for the military. DiCaprio's Hughes balances ambitious plans well laid out with the creeping advent of uncontrollable mental illness. Closeups show a Hughes who knows something is going rather wrong but he hasn't the ability to fight it (or the shrinks).As Hughes's lover Ava Gardner, Kate Beckinsale is very grown up and convincing. She's a versatile actress and she proves it again here.The denouement of Hughes's public life was a vicious scandal engineered by Pan Am's Juan Trippe (a smooth, venal Alec Baldwin) who controlled Maine's Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (a not as nice as we usually expect him to be Alan Alda). Trippe coveted a monopoly for international flights for Pan Am (anyone see a Pan Am plane lately?) and Hughes's TWA was an obstacle that had to be neutralized by law or acquired by coerced sale.The Senate hearing is over dramatized but it reflects a dirty world of false accusations and behind the scenes chicanery that, I understand, actually occurs from time to time. Shocking.Perhaps Hughes's greatest gift to mankind was not his into the air briefly only once, eight-engine Spruce Goose, but his getting Jane Russell in ""The Outlaw"" to the screen past the censors. Many male libidos owed much to that film's release. But the men who couldn't bare to have Russell's ample cleavage on big screens held up the movie's release for SIX years. Awful!Jude Law who is in nearly every movie these days shows up as Errol Flynn. A forgettable performance.DiCaprio, Blanchett, Beckinsale, Alda and Baldwin make a good team with a master director, Scorsese. Wonder what's next?Good use is made of period newsreels and the score helps keep the dialog moving nicely.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great work by Scorsese and his cast,"Well directed biopic of Howard Hughes that's probably too ambitious and original to be called a biopic. This is simply the story of Hughes' early, gigantic life where he imagined giant movies, glamorous women, and futuristic airplanes, but was crippled by an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sure, this isn't Scorsese's most personal film, but I never quite thought of him as a straight auteur. A lot of his films do share common themes, but there's always Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, The Age of Innocence, and After Hours. I think of Scorsese first and foremost as a master of the medium, an especially skilled director, and I think The Aviator is one of his greatest directorial triumphs. He is a master of developing the mood of the picture and controlling its pace. It flows beautifully. The film boasts some of the very best acting of the year, too. Leonardo DiCaprio is just coming into his mature period as an actor, and this is his best performance to date. It's definitely Oscar worthy. Cate Blanchett is a marvel playing Katharine Hepburn. At first I wasn't sure if she was just doing a crass imitation, but her character really develops nicely. Cate disappears and we then have Kate. Just try to keep her from carrying home the statuette! Another Kate, Kate Beckinsale, is also very good as Ava Gardener. She's not a great actress, but she holds her own here. Add to them fine supporting performances from John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, and Ian Holm. Also Jude Law, in his fiftieth film appearance of 2004, plays Errol Flynn and is so good that I wanted a lot more. I love films about Golden Age Hollywood, and I like trying to spot the references. One of the best and most entertaining movies of 2004 thus far. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Worth the $10 bucks, a bag of popcorn, and large coke.","The Aviator by Martin Scorsese took his films to new heights on this one. His tribute to life of the eccentric millionaire, Howard Hughes, was profoundly moving. Growing up in Los Angeles, I've been reminded of the Howard Hughes legacy from time to time. The Spruce Goose has a whole new meaning to me. Scorcese brought Howard alive on the screen and I walked away actually wanting to fly TWA on my next flight.Leonardo DiCaprio was amazing. For three hours, he was no longer Leo but was Howard Hughes himself. A definite contender for an Oscar. The supporting cast complemented Leo's work in bringing out the the complexities of a genius on the verge of madness. The Kates, Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale touched the softer side of Hughes' personal life. While John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda defined his business savvy. But Leo was something else- someone else for that matter. He took on this role like a true actor to trade. Leo earned his wings on this one.Watch it. It's definitely worth the $10 bucks, a bag of popcorn, and large coke.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Brilliant Failure,"Decades ago when I was at the Wolper Company in Los Angeles, my supervisor, David Seltzer, who wrote the Omen franchise, came into my office and put a book on my desk - a biography of Howard Hughes. ""Could you write a treatment of this?"" Dave asked. ""Sure,"" I said. I skimmed the book and yawned. Why would anyone be interested in Howard Hughes, I asked myself. The same applies to The Aviator. Who cares? And that is the core of the problem with the film. For all its brilliance in so many ways, from casting to photography to music to design, The Aviator is not only state of the art, it achieves a threshold that sets a new standard for motion pictures. But ultimately the film fails because we simply do not care about Howard Hughes, and there are so many reasons why we don't care. Sure, he was a genius, but he was also a bonified nut case and because of that fact alone it is impossible to relate to him much less have any feeling or emotion for him.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surprisingly Entertaining,"Well color me surprised. Scorcese does wonders with this film. It is very good, but not great. The cinematography and direction of this movie is inspired. Scorcese throws in plenty of interesting camera work, and his directing considers every period detail. Perhaps the only thing that I found odd about this period piece (1930s - 1940s) is that it never really deals with WWII. The characters are so insulated that WWII only surfaces in relation to airplane deals and congressional expenditures.In any event, this movie is thoroughly entertaining despite its almost 3 hr running time. Hughes' life provides plenty of interesting material for movie, even if the movie doesn't take us to the sordid ending of Hughes life.DiCaprio does an excellent job as Hughes. He is very believable as Hughes at all levels of his life. I was pleasantly surprised by his performance, as I am not a fan of his (didn't like Titanic and thought his performance in Gangs of New York was weak by comparison to Daniel Day Lewis). His efforts to portray Hughes' genius, eccentricity, and ultimately his mental illness were seamless and believable.Blanchett as Hepburn was great. She plays her over the top, full of life, and very interesting. Whenever she was on the screen the movie just hummed along.Surprisingly, the next best actor was Alan Alda as a corrupt Senator. What a wonderful effort being cast against his sensitive nice guy image.While the movie doesn't have a real emotional or philosophical center to it, it is still entertaining as hell. Perhaps the lack of center isn't so much a defect as a realistic view that most lives do not neatly convey a philosophical message or unfold in a clear cut manner (despite the fact that Hollywood tries to give biopics some philosophical theme or message). Whether it is the draw of fantastic wealth, the gambler's spirit, the womanizing with Hollywood's most attractive starlets, or the inventive entrepreneurial spirit, the Aviator is entertaining from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Di Caprio all the way,"This is just a movie that Scorsese made for DiCaprio. After the Oscar fiasco, I thought the Academy was a little harsh on Scorsese, especially for a man who has got 6 nominations in his career, but after watching both the movies 'Million Dollar Baby' and 'the Aviator' I have to say that the Academy was right in giving the former the best picture award.Why would I disregard Scorsese's epic with such disregard???Well just like Howard Hughes' epic Hell's Angels was ignored by critics in its early days as depicted in the movie many would agree with The Aviator as well........ The only difference is that Hell's Angels was an epic hit whereas the Aviator would just remain a sideway movie, which people will cease to remember a few days later......Don't think I'm full of harsh words for the movie, because Leonardo DiCaprio was fabulous..... He tried his level best to pull the movie away, but with the genuine lack of a definite plot, his efforts were mostly to the drain..... Apart from the characters of Hepburn and Hughes all the other characters lacked a proper definition.. I mean Alan Alda was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for the movie.... After watching the movie all I can say is that he was a total BS, instead John Reilly was a better option.... The very essence of the movie, the eccentricity of the great Hughes is not very well depicted.... Like Beautiful Mind where the eccentricity stole the show, Scorsese fails to show us the reason for the eccentricity of Hughes.....All in all the great epic of Scorsese remains as an actor's failed chance to fame. DiCaprio finally proved his acting talents but he put his name in a poor movie which lacks a proper direction.....In the end a very scratchy 7/10 from me..........",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing visuals and performances all around,"Leo blew me away in this movie. He definitely gives the best performance of his career. He is so good as Howard Hughes: the courtroom scene, all the scenes with him on the airplane and being the director. His accent and expressions are all great, and he portrayed the disease very well. It's certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination and possibly even the win.The supporting cast is also great. Cate Blanchett performed Kate Hepturn beautifully. It's a very showy supporting role, and her first interaction with Leo on the golf course cries Oscar, while her last scene with Leo through the door showed her range. I like Baldwin a lot in this movie, and Alda played the senator very efficiently.The production value and visual effects are also grand. The only minor complaint I have is that it was a little long in the middle and seems to lose its focus for a while before getting it back at the congressional hearing. 9 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Aviator,"Aviator is a piece of artwork that took just as long to make as it took Howard Hughes to build a proper flying airplane; it takes a very penetrating look at the life of an overwhelmingly wealthy person with an idea that required more than attention but attention. The interpretation of his life as depicted by Leonardo DiCaprio needed the advice of Martin Scorsese to fully show the personality but it worked well. Leonardo, the innocent soft faced, I thought would find it difficult to play the role but with definite manipulation from Scorsese, made it through as direct, indirect, attentive, withdrawn, there, not there, berserk, ridiculous, smart, witty, charming, quirky and quiet. This actor I felt gave up a thing that I would call ""baby"" or ""young"" for an actor and reached into adulthood but back to self. Very long - over 3 hours",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
a great entertaining adventure,"One of the best movies I have seen, the acting was absolutely outstanding. Despite its length, the movie moved quickly. DeCaprio played the part exactly as one would picture Hughes. He was exceptional with the psychotic episodes, from his youth to later in life. My husband and I truly enjoyed the film, which doesn't happen often enough! The only change I would suggest is to edit out a couple of minutes near the end-it started to get drawn out-but then it was over anyway. His personal life was fascinating, also loved the part when he faced the senate committee and turned it around to them-that was great part! The flight scenes took your breath away, felt like you were flying too. And the crash in Hollywood, felt like you were there when it happened. I had no idea he had been through something like that-no wonder he had so many health problems.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Magnificent acting by Leo DiCaprio,"The story really has to get a grip for itself because the movie seems not to be depicting a balanced portrayal of a person. But it may yet slip through as the person depicted lived more than fifty years ago. I see the movie a little too much in depicting Hughes' weaknesses, particularly his obsessive compulsive behavior and his paranoia of just about everything. But that in turn gave Leo his chance to elaborate on his acting. Thus the acting overall is indeed a great work in my eyes. Leo DiCaprio did very well in depicting the movie's version of Howard Hughes. I really like the way hoe Leo's acting seems to carry Hughes' weaknesses to other scenes, even on the ones in which Hughes is a strong person. Having John C. Reilly and an assortment of A-list talents really helped to balance the whole acting overall and took it to the greatness level it deserved.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Over Produced Junk,"What in the world happened to Martin Scorsese? Here is the creator of Dog Day Afternoon and Wise Guys, a man considered one of the best of the 1970's Golden Age of Film, but film by film his stuff gets more over produced, less insightful, and more expensive. I saw it coming with Gangs of New York, but somebody keep Leonardo DiCaprio away from this guy. They are awful together and The Aviator is one big expensive, good-looking bore without a soul.In a documentary on Neo-Realism, Italian Post War Cinema, Scorsese claims he started with storyboards as a child, a comic book look that is produced giving the director a visualization of what the film will look like. The trouble with The Aviator, it looks like a storyboard. The replicas and animation of Hugh's weird airplanes almost steal the show, because they are the only interesting thing to look at on screen. Howard Hughes is never fleshed out. At least Kinsey, a recent bio flick tried to show why Kinsey was what he was, but DiCaprio's Hugh's is some kind of freak because his mother talked about diseases while he bathed. There's not enough there Martin. The bulk of the film shows a very young actor with no physical resemblance to Howard Hughes talking big time business and avionics without any back-story on how he became so brilliant out of the crib? The women in Hugh's life are trotted out one by one. He's a cocky guy putting his hand under a cigarette flappers skirt, a rich boy lover for Kathryn Hepburn (She doesn't come off too swell in this version), and Ava Gardner (No wonder Sinatra and Artie Shaw had it easy with this chick after the money-bags geekdom of Hughes). None of these gals are fleshed out other than Hollywood publicity shrek.Don't bother with this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best film of 2004,"I was definitely no fan of Leo, but he played Howard Hughes SO well in ""The aviator"" that he made me really rethink my opinion of him. He really captured the way Hughes lived and the way his personality changed over time. I am an aviation enthusiast as well and I can attest to the accuracy of the aviation aspects of the film. Each actor played the real life character they were acting as to a tee. They all deserve Oscars in my opinion. I think this is the film Martan will finally get the Oscar for. A great film and a must see for everyone who reads this. Get to the movies to see this, you won't regret it.

Crazy movie,"And the story is also that of a crazy man, the famous millionaire Howard Hughes who had a tremendous initiative power always acting stubbornly against all tides and winds to achieve his aims. Besides a great businessman he also excelled in such different activities as plane driver and movie director. Crazy and unpredictable but also a human being with all the respective frailties and idiosyncrasies. In my opinion DiCaprio was not a good choice for this character since his boyish appearance and manners make the character very unconvincing. It would require a more strong personality such as of De Niro or Liam Neeson for instance. And a curious note: the portrayed characters never get physically older. All of them during the about 30 years in which the story develops itself, keep the same physical aspect which they had at their first appearance including the main character after all those vicissitudes he had to endure. Also the sudden changes of Hughes from sanity to insanity and back are not well characterized or explained, with DeCaprio revealing himself a mediocre actor once more. But except these flaws the movie is well done, the story is solid and sound and its events develop themselves in a good rhythm and the music is excellent. The scenes of the Senate Committee hearings are also a high moment in the movie. After all this movie is worth to be seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautiful, Expensive and Without Heart","I do not know the biography of Howard Hughes, and the magnificent ""Scarface""is the unique movie of his filmography that I have watched. By the number of nominations of ""The Aviator"", the minimum that I could expect would be to know a little about the biography of this American businessman. Unfortunately, the great director Martin Scorcese made a beautiful expensive movie, typically aiming to win the Oscar, but emotionally very shallow and with a very weak screenplay, with many parts very similar to a big soap-opera. After 170 minutes running time, I am not sure whether Howard Hughes was a genius, or a psychotic irresponsible prodigal millionaire born in silver spoon. Leonardo DiCaprio, in my opinion, was miscast with his baby-face in the role of Howard Hughes. The cast is excellent, and the production is outstanding, but in the end I was not fully satisfied with this film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Aviador"" (""The Aviator"")",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An OK movie, but not as great as the critics make us believe","I went to see this movie after the Oscar nominations, but before the actual Oscars were awarded. The Aviator got a lot of nominations and got good critics in many papers, so of course I went to the cinema with high expectations. The high expectations didn't help, but this movie was a let down to me. The filmography is nice. The music is OK, but not impressive. The story is quite nice to hear as I didn't know much about Howard Hughes. However the much appraised performance of Leonardo di Caprio is definitely not worth an Oscar in my view. Never in the movie did I feel any connection to the character of Howard Hughes. Halfway the movie I got the feeling that I was watching quite a mediocre movie. It did get better to the end, but still it left the feeling that I had watched a nice documentary of which I didn't really learn anything.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

DiCaprio was excellent,"I am a 44 year old male movie buff and not necessarily a Leo fan--I liked ""Titanic"" and ""Catch me if you can"" but not much else. I have been a Howard Hughes fan for years and I liked a previous TV movie on his life. The Movie trailers were what sold me to see the movie.I thought DiCaprio was credible as Hughes and he did a good job keeping me interested in the three hour epic. That is what I go to see movies for and He did his job in making me believe he was Hughes. I also think he should get an Oscar nod and hope to see more of this kind of acting from him in the future.So, IMHO it was a very credible movie from a talented actor that made me want to see more of his work. I am not a female, nor gay and I am way too old to be a groupie. See this movie if you like to be entertained.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
He did it his way,"Hughes did it all HIS way and look where it got him. Leo, in his best performance since Gilbert Grape, does a great job of recreating one of America's great whack jobs when he was in his prime. In Martin Scorcese's best film in more than 2 decades the fast times and tragedy are recreated amazingly well. A sure fire choice for best picture. And another note--Cate Blanchet is amazing as Kate Hepburn, under Marty's steady eye she never steals the movie but more than shows her worth. Right in the center of the film is a moment in film I will never forget. That epic one-man plane crash is one of the most stunning sights I've ever seen on film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of Scorcese's Very Best Works; Ten out of Ten,"This is the first Scorsese film I ever saw. It is also, with the admission that I have not seen anything close to all his films, one of his greatest. At over two and a half hours long, it is a sprawling epic through the rise and fall of one of the era's biggest personalities. Yet it seems quick, much like some of the airplanes Hughes sought to build. Not short in any way, shape, or form. But quick. It doesn't lag. It doesn't linger too long.Martin Scorsese, managing to not show any signs of slowing down even after all those decades of filmmaking, has developed such an intuition for film that it makes this film look like it itself has an intuition. Every time it needs to stay on a moment, it stays. Every time it needs to whip through time, it does so properly (you'd think this one would be simple, but it can be done great (this), well (most films), or badly (the first thing that jumped into my head was The Notebook, which jumped across the one big event during its timespan (WWII) in about five minutes)). When it lifts you up, you feel like you are flying. And when it takes a turn for the emotionally disturbing, you feel like your spirit crashed. This is a film that gave me the feeling that it knew exactly what it was doing and that never let me down.By the way, is it just me, or is 2004 an underrated year for film? Both this film and the last one that I reviewed (HP:PoA) were made in that year. As were The Incredibles, Million Dollar Baby, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. All five of these films have passed into the category of 'If you don't like this film, your taste leaves something to be desired.' Four of them (sorry Million Dollar Baby, I really like you but I don't love you) are in my top 100 films of all time.'Twas a quite competitive year indeed. Yet I do believe that in many respects, this film tops it. While it is not my favorite film of the year (that would be ESotSM), it is the film that I believe should have won best picture that year. If there is one movie that best represented achievements in cinema in this year, it is this movie.As a fan of aviation, I had heard of Howard Hughes. I knew a general outline of his life. But my prior knowledge was naught but a skeleton compared to what I now know. I do believe that I am one of the best arguments against those who say that film cannot educate you about the physical world about us. I have learned far more about the world and the people in it from films and articles than I ever did from school. to quote Mark Twain, ""I have never let school interfere with my education."" All this is a roundabout way of saying that this film paints in your mind a stylish picture of Hughes' life that both rings true and resonant.I am surprised that there had never been a good biopic of Hughes before this. Given how eventful his life was, it wouldn't be hard. And given his contributions to film, I'm surprised Hollywood hadn't taken an opportunity to once more pat themselves on the back. He is one of the truest examples of the eccentric, popular, multi-talented, billionaires that make the first few decades of the 20th century some of my favorite in all of history and that are so noticeably absent from the world today. And I would argue that few people made more of an impact on this time period than Howard Hughes.This film shows that. The brash young Texan goes into movies and aviation and... a lot more.This is the first sentence of his Wikipedia page: Howard Robard Hughes, Jr. (December 24, 1905 – April 5, 1976) was an American business tycoon, entrepreneur, investor, aviator, aerospace engineer, inventor, filmmaker and philanthropist. He was a man of high highs and low lows, and there is no one better to show these complexities than the man I consider to be the greatest actor of his generation, Leo DiCaprio. As a fan of Leo and of Hughes, I was hoping that he would deliver. And he did. While I think that he should have an Oscar or two by now for various roles, he is at his absolute best here. I would even argue that it is one of the ten or fifteen greatest performances ever filmed.You may notice on that Wikipedia description that he did not die until 1976. This film does not show him in his last few decades of life, usual for a biopic. There is a reason for that. With disabling OCD and without proper medication, Hughes went... well, insane.This film handles that, like everything else, very well. It shows his descent into darkness in startling detail, filming it in such a way that one could not think anything but that he was going insane. Many films would have shyed away from this. Others would have exploited it. Not the crack team of Scorsese/DiCaprio. You get the feeling that you are in cold but unmaleficent hands. What is shown is exactly what needs to be shown for purpose's sake. Nothing more or less.Watching the film again, I almost wanted Hughes to die in the plane crash so he wouldn't be subjected to torment. But it wasn't a simple feeling. Rather, it was a complex, fully realized one. Not that many movies back me feel that way. Like its subject, it is one of a kind.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Brilliant, sad","Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is the tragic story of how a man's grand genius practically destroys his mind. It's also a glorious homage to the golden years of Hollywood, and to a man's strength in expanding upon his empire, defeating his criticizers and, most of the time, winning.The man is Howard Hughes, infamous movie and airplane mogul who got his start directing ""Hell's Angels"" in the late twenties. The movie opens here, with Hughes begging for just two more cameras, so that he can have twenty-six instead of a mere twenty-four to make the big climactic dogfight scene. Once he succeeds and the movie is nearly done, but then ""The Jazz Singer"" is released and Hughes decides to re-shoot the entire movie in sound. His assistant Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) is skeptical. Everyone is skeptical. Hughes ignores them and does it anyway.These beginning scenes have a breakneck pace and involve Hugh emptying his pockets over and over again. To everyone else this seems like a plan to go broke, but Hughes sees things in the long run, knowing that if ""Hell's Angels"" is made with sound, more people will see it, more times. He is wise, and knows his plans will pull through in the end; it's his high-strung, nervous demeanor that puts everyone else off.After ""Hell's Angels"" Hughes switches from making movies to making airplanesfast, revolutionary airplanes. He makes his planes the same way he makes his movies: dozens of last minute improvements, mind-changing, and lots and lots of money loss. He remains confident; it is his stubbornness and ego that drive him to his accomplishments.But he has a problem, one few know about. It is severe OCD, though I don't think the phrase had been coined yet. Because of some scarring episodes with his mother when he was a child Howard goes through the rest of his life worrying a lot about germs. Since he is an inherited millionaire he is able to feed his worries: people accept it when he asks for one steak and exactly six peas.Meanwhile he manages to balance this with a life of womanizing. Hughes was famous for dating many successful actresses, of which Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) are seen most in the film.Cate Blanchett does not significantly resemble Hepburn  she probably wouldn't be the first to come to mind for the part  but after seeing her in it I can't imagine anyone else in the part. She is perfectthis girl can act. For anyone else it would be an impersonation but for Blanchett it's a performance. Her scenes are wonderfulthe presence of Hepburn in the movie is not used as a gimmick or a cameo, but as an actual part of the film, a significant part of Hughes' life. She has some very heartwarming and heartbreaking scenes, her performance is a delight, richly deserving her Oscar nomination (and maybe a win too).Indeed, since most of the cast are playing celebrities, it opens it up for them to overact or impersonate their characters, but all of the actors hit just the right note, like Kate Beckinsale as the proud Gardner or Jude Law showing up as the gaudy, obnoxious Errol Flynn. Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda play Hughes foremost enemies: scheming Panam head Juan Trippe and Brewster, the senator that Trippe has bought.Both Baldwin and Alda have excellent scenes where they try to play off of Hughes' OCD to throw him off during negotiations: one where Trippe speaks to Hughes through an office room door and blows his pipe smoke through the keyhole into the room and another where during a dinner Brewster places a fingertip on Hughes' glass while serving him nearly raw fish. Hughes reacts to both these situations in a different way, but he is always desperately trying to maneuver himself out from under the schemes of those plotting against him.Hughes does a different kind of maneuvering, in the scenes where his money pays off (or doesn't) when he flies his planes. One scene in particular, is stunning, when Hughes takes his newest plane for a ride, breaks a speed record, but loses control over Beverly Hills. It would be a sin for me to spoil what happens, but I can say that it is an exciting, scary thrill of a scene.Martin Scorsese directs excellently, this is one of his best films. Many of his films take place over a span of many decades, but this is the first one I've seen that captures these periods so beautifully. The cinematography is wonderful, filming each decade the way movies were filmed then (just, with colour), not a gimmick but a smart way of creating a flow. Most films are either all style or all substance, but Scorsese is one of the few who can meld them both into an emotionally and visually intriguing film.Oh, and Howard Hughes is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, not the first actor you'd think of (like, say, Jason Robards). He doesn't look like the man, no, but why should that be an issue with acting? DiCaprio masters the mannerisms, the glory and the madness. It is a magnificent performance, one that takes a person who was a potential genius and follows him through his life. The film ends on the perfect note, which pretty much sums up the remainder of Hughes life. It is a film to see.8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
There could have been a lesson to this movie,"There could have been a lesson to this movie. Instead, the whole painful three hours skirted around it, whitewashing a truth that was far more interesting than this odd portrait of Howard Hughes.In his prime, Howard Hughes was 6'4"" tall and strong: a strapping man. When he died, he weighed 93 pounds. One of the striking images of my youth, was that of this shriveled, white-bearded little human being carried to the car by his bodyguard. Howard Hughes had become a tiny, grotesque, skeletal puppet.Watching ""The Aviator"" was not unlike the tour of Graceland, the home of Elvis Presley. In both places, we are treated to a view of the eccentric and wonderful genius, but something is left out.And that thing, is the drugs.Yes, Hughes was obsessive-compulsive, germ-phobic to a point of the bizarre, but his paranoias were increased, honed, finally made all-encompassing by something far more understandable  his drug addiction.Howard Hughes did indeed have the enormous plane wreck that's depicted mid-way through ""The Aviator."" The amount of morphine, codeine, and goodness knows what else that would have been necessary to treat that much burn tissue, broken ribs, and collapsed lung, would make an addict out of anyone. Add a compulsive and addictive personality, and all the money in the world, and it's not hard to understand what happened to Hughes.What is hard to understand, is why that wasn't in Scorsese's movie.In one interesting scene, we see Ava Gardner reappear in Hughes' life to get him ready to appear before a congressional hearing. Hughes had locked himself in his movie studio, and then in a wing of his mansion, refusing to touch anything, delusional, insane. In scriptwriter John Logan's version, Gardner shaves him, cleans him up, gives him a pep talk, and this cures his insanity and he's ready to go head to head with the United States Senate.This makes no sense, of course. And how much more sense, how much more interesting and valuable an episode could this have been, if we saw what seems far more likely: that what Gardner did, was truly to ""clean him up."" She got him sober. She put him back together, straightening him out just long enough that he could face something other than his drug-strengthened demons.There are great bits in this movie, strong parts that contribute to the tragedy of this movie's inevitable vacuousness. Cate Blanchett's impersonation of Katherine Hepburn is so spot-on that it's funny, and finally even touching. When a film is released in December, you know that they're shooting for Oscars, and this one is surely aimed at getting a nomination for DiCaprio, but he's miscast. Hughes by all accounts was large, terse, intense, and DiCaprio is too energetic and boyish for this mature role. The camera and visual direction are lovely, if too long. The aviation scenes are fabulous.OK, so perhaps a defense of ""The Aviator"" would go like this: this movie wasn't supposed to be about drugs. It was about Hughes in a few years of his life when he was directing movies and changing the world of aviation, which he surely and undoubtedly did. It's about the congressional investigation and his start into the world of madness. Presenting the drugs would have made it, finally, a picture about an addict, instead of about an aviator.If so, then the my-mom-told-me-germs-are-bad didn't need the massive play it got. The mental illness it too central to the entire picture. Personality disorder is the driving force of ""The Aviator,"" and it's wrong.That defense doesn't work, furthermore, when the movie claims to be a biography, and anyway the essence needn't be ""Howard Hughes in Trainspotting."" If ""The Aviator's"" Hughes had, locked in his studio, taken some pills just once; if Ava Gardner had shown up in his mansion and thrown away the prescription bottles; these small gestures would have made the point about the truth without becoming a preachy anti-drug lecture. Instead, it made up a fiction.By the end of this film, I practically wanted to stand up and shout at the entire audience, ""He was a drug addict! When he died, he weighed 90 pounds! What is this nonsense?"" Instead, I just left, and returned home to look up one glowing review after another on the internet. One of Time Magazine's reviewers has put it on the top of his ""Best"" list for 2004. Time Magazine was the one that had that famous picture of the shriveled and near-death Hughes on its cover, in 1976. (http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101761213,00.html)Removing the drugs from the lives of Howard Hughes, and Elvis Presley, is not a virtuous whitewash that allows us to retain our heroes. Rather, it loses the value of the tragedy. When I was a high school teacher, I could look kids in the eye who were starting to experiment and say to them: ""Look at the people lying on the street in their stupors, and ask yourself: 'How many of these people thought they were going to become addicts?' The answer is none. 'How many of them thought, as you do, ""That won't happen to me. I'm different. I can take it or leave it as I wish""?' The answer is all of them. They're just like you.""Addiction could happen to hard-working, generous, perspicacious, brilliant men such as Howard Hughes, and Elvis Presley. And look what it did to them. This story would have been a far, far more interesting, compelling, and honest film, than this look-at-the-nutcase bit of Hollywood tinsel.Instead, this movie does something that Hughes, himself, might very well have appreciated, something that he did while in Hollywood. It told a story full of pretty faces and dishonesty: one that didn't make very much sense.Perhaps there was a lesson to this movie, after all.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fantastic film.,"This is a fantastic story of a man who had it all and quickly lost it. Scorsese presents us with a fascinating look at the world of showbusiness but in a completely three dimensional way. With some people thinking this film is just about the glitz and nothing else, they just need to take one look at Leonardo Dicaprios performance. Not only do i strongly disagree with the academy favouring Jamie Foxx's unremarkable depiction of Ray Charles but i also feel that this one of the most remarkable displays of acting in the history of cinema.Scorsese uses his a-list cast to perfection. Alec Baldwin is used to perfection in a small role. Cate Blanchett shines and deservedly wins an Oscar for it. Alda shows us that actors do improve with age. And smaller roles from the likes of Beckinsale and Jude Law show us that there's a reason these actors wanted to be part of this movie. And its simply because, it's brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Scorsese's best ? i don't think so, Di Caprio's Best? Indeed!!!","Martin Scorsese is taking the art of film direction to another level (hey, guys this is my personal point of view please respect it! ;) ), no director on earth can get the best of Leonardo DiCaprio better than Scorsese.The art direction is amazing in every aspect, the editing the cinematography even the costumes, are calling the academy awards.let us now talk about the acting,Leonardo DiCaprio is dazzling as Howard Hughes the godfather of the aviation industry in America in the first half of the 20th century, he performed superbly the phsycological side of Hughes's life, a well deserved Oscar nomination, thank god he won a golden globe for that role, because it would have been totally unfair for him not to win a major award for such a magnificent performance. Cate Blanchett, is Katharine Hepburn the academy award winning actress, once a girlfriend of Howard Hughes,Cate Blanchett is simply magnetic,she really is the queen of the scene,her presence is lighting the film, i have never been convinced by an Oscar wining role as much as i was convinced by this role(alongside her is Jennifer Connelly in A BEAUTIFUL MIND). the rest of the supporting cast were all amazing, Alan Alda as the embarrassed Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, was truly amazing. this film is maybe the best of Martin Scorsese so far even better than good fellas. and the crew worked with him were very smart.thank you all for this masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
DiCaprio and Blanchett make this work!!,"I was pleasantly surprised by it. Didn't know what to expect. I was quite impressed with a few of the biopics I've seen - WALK THE LINE, RAY, MIRACLE (that one is more about the Miracle on Ice win but also focuses greatly on the coach Herb Brooks) so I decided to give THE AVIATOR a whirl (ahem). DiCaprio in recent years has proved himself to be quite the actor so I really wanted to see his take on Howard Hughes. Let me tell ya - DiCaprio hit this one out of the park!! By far his best performance!! The mannerisms and all the foibles/compulsive disorders that he brought out in his performance were outstanding!!I immediately went and read up as much as I could about Hughes and his life. I was already a bit fascinated with this man even before seeing the film - although I must admit that my fascination stemmed more from his latter years as a recluse and the fact that Jimmy Dean's Willard Whyte character in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER was based on him. But I had no idea he played such a huge part in aviation and in the film business earlier in his life. That part of his life I knew almost nothing about. And it was DiCaprio's performance that fed my interest in the man even more. Bravo, Leo!!And then there's Cate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn - a maaaarvelous performance!! I was like... DAYUM!!! She IS Hepburn!! Leo and Cate basically made this movie for me. Up until then my favorite lead performances of 2004 were Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks. Both did a splendid job. But sorry... Leo beats them both!!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e meets Rosebud,"Enter with an open mind and you'll be richly rewarded with Scorsese's meticulous rendering of Howard Hughe's genius and its demise. But don't expect to fall into a comfortable narrative drama. THE AVIATOR is more like CITIZEN KANE, almost a newsreel that conveys the power of a brilliant man driven by his own vision against all odds.Despite this stark and challenging frame, Scorsese and his wonderful team, including set designer Dante Feretti and a score of talented actors, still is able to convey Hughes' fragile humanity as he struggles to control the delusions and paranoia that eventually destroy his life. At the end of the movie, one mourns for Hughes as one mourned for Kane -- the loss of one man who labored a lifetime to overcome a childhood trauma and achieved great things.Of course Scorsese's film is more than that. He coaxes a magnificently mature and nuanced performance out of Leonardo DiCaprio, and may even win him an Oscar. Cate Blanchette as Kate Hepburn at first seems excessive, until her veneer begins to peel away -- again a tribute to Scorsese's skill as a director, and Blanchette's bountiful acting abilities.The three hours went quickly as one fabulous scene and set replaced another. The vintage clips of HELL'S ANGELS interspersed with new footage are, alone, worth the price of admission. Without giving away the ending, go see the old planes fly.Don't miss seeing this wonderful film on the big screen. It's a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very Exciting!,"This is an extremely watchable movie. A very exciting movie. What this movie is not, is a biography. Myabe it's Mr. Scorsese' opinion of Hughes but I think other biographies and historical documents would find it wanting on truth. But I guess it's his truth.There's a reasonable amount of action along with the drama, there's even some funny dialog. I was not prepared to be impressed with someone as young as Mr. DiCaprio doing a person from history like Howard Hughes. Hughes is a larger than life character, but the youth of DiCaprio started to disappear as the Hughes character began his decline into madness. Mr. DiCaprio even atarts to look like a young Howard Hughes.Ms. Blanchett is the best part of this movie though. She captures Katherine Hepburn precisely. I have seen most of the late Ms.Hepburn's movies and interviews and Ms. Blanchett's portrayal deserves an Oscar. If her performance were not as good as it is, she would deserve one for such a great effort playing someone as equally larger than life like Ms. Katherine Hepburn.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This leaves a lot to be desired; Hepburn notwithstanding,"I presume this movie was released more or less in conjunction with the centennial of the birth of Howard Hughes; he was born on Christmas Eve 1905. This film covers, or at least tries to cover, the ""public"" period of Howard Hughes life, which is shown here as being from 1927 to 1947. That is not too far off. He did not go into seclusion the day he flew the ""Spruce Goose"" though he was well on his way by that time. Hughes was seen frequently for a few more years after wards, then by 1954 or so it became very difficult to find him. He flew a Lockhead Electra on a few occasions in 1958 in Los Angeles; making touch and go landings at the airfield on some Sunday mornings. It seemed that most people working at the airport then knew who was flying that plane, but that didn't generated enough interest to call up the press. By the early 1960s he would venture out rarely, but it was not until 1966-when he started buying up Las Vegas- that his state of seclusion became newsworthy. This movie does not attempt to show those years as the director evidently felt the viewers would already be quite familiar with that phase of Hughes' life.The main problem is that what is shown has already been shown in other films; even more accurately. About a year after Hughes died the made for TV movie ""Howard the Amazing Mr. Hughes"" depicted the 1927-1947 phase of Hughes life even more realistically than this movie does EXCEPT for one area, and that area is the strength of this movie and probably the reason, other than the centennial issue, why it was made. As I mentioned before other films have already shown this part of Hughes' life in realistic detail as this part of his life was very well documented. In one area though it was NOT well documented and that was about the intimate relations between Hughes and Katherine Hepburn. It was not until her death very recently that letters and notes and other writings between them were discovered in her personal effects. This represented the last known treasure trove of Hughes writings (until his infamous missing will is found) to be discovered. That gives a look at Hughes that had not been seen before. It also shows a lot of Hepburn that is not seen very often as it is part of her life that predates Spencer Tracey. That is, I believe, one of the main reasons why this film was made; not only as a tribute to Hughes but also to Hepburn- who was adored by the movie industry in her later years. The movie also implies that the breakup between the two started Howard Hughes over the edge, but I doubt that was the case in real life. Still, the scenes with the young Hepburn and Hughes are a refreshing part of the movie and I have no doubt that Cate Blanchett shows the young Hepburn as she really was in private with Hughes.Speaking of romance- One of the problems with this film is the omission of even mentioning Hughes' first marriage- to the daughter of the founder of Rice University. They were married for five years and did not divorce until the filming of Hell's Angels (shown in this movie) was well underway. Why Katherine Hepburn's first marriage is mentioned in the movie and Hughes' is not is probably something of an oversight as it causes him to appear as a playboy who simply cannot commit whereas in reality he was married three times.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mastery,"There's no such thing as the perfect movie, but I consider myself a harsh critic and The Aviator was immediately one of my favorites. It's one of the only movies I've ever seen twice in the theater. If it had been performed live, I would have been on my feet at the curtain drop. I have heard some people say they didn't like it, mainly because it was either too dark or too slow. In my opinion, it was right on target as far as the mood created by the film in relation to Howard Hughes' life. The balance, especially, was appropriate. It would be hard to respect a biographical movie about a real person (with a life much darker than was depicted by the movie, I might add) if that movie ignored one of the most important characteristics of its star. Hughes led a tragic life. I'm a fan of creative artistry in film, as opposed to disliking a movie if it doesn't have a fast pace or lots of emotional evocation from the audience. That being said, I found the Aviator to be a fantastic display of cinematic mastery (and I'm not even a huge Scorsese fan). It is one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen (especially for young people), and the thrill of dramatic events in history being made by Hughes are portrayed in a way that really captivated my own thrill and even caused me to forget about the movie theater I was sitting in at times (a rare thing). The best part about it is its historic accuracy - excellent for Hollywood, especially in a movie that was made to astound the audience. It's true, the tone is dark for a lot of the movie, but it's rightfully so. Howard Hughes led an astounding but privately tragic life, and I see that translated on screen in an appropriate-for-a-movie manner. Not too depressing, but not to flippant. And there's plenty of breathtaking action if that's what you're looking for. On a side note, I have never liked Leonardo DiCaprio. I take credit for some of his not-so-romantic nicknames. But in The Aviator, I find, he has finally come into his won as an actor. Until now I've seen his acting as immature and green, but he has finally become a man. Not only that, but I applaud Scorsese for casting Leo because there are times when the physical similarity between him and Hughes is amazing. I never would have guessed.My recommendation: read a quick online biography or two about Howard Hughes before you see the film. I did, and I found his life story fascinating, not to mention that it complements the movie and makes it much more enjoyable to watch - being well informed about what's going on.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Long but Classical Film!,"I could see why Leonardo DiCaprio would want to play Howard Hughes. He was an incredible genius but also deeply troubled man. This film shows how Howard Hughes operated with the women in his life like Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Faith, and others. He was paranoid and obsessive compulsive disorder. He was terrified of germs. There are more scenes in the film about his spiraling out of control with his mental illness than anything else. Despite his obvious inflictions, he was truly a brilliant businessman, aviator, and film producer. Nothing was too small or impossible for Howard Hughes. I thought Cate Blanchet deserved her Academy Award for playing iconic actress, Katharine Hepburn. Let's face it, Kate Hepburn was an extraordinarily gifted actress and an American treasure. Blanchett pulled off the performance perfectly to make even Hepburn proud of it. The relationship between Howard Hughes and Kate Hepburn was mutual admiration and love even when she left him. Hughes' love for Kate went further than that. The rest of the cast includes Kate Beckinsale (Ava Gardner), Sir Ian Holm, John C. Reilly, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, etc. Everybody in the film business wants to work with Scorsese and who can blame them. I want to work with him. This film is nearly perfect if not too long at times but truly captures some of Howard Hughes' troubled and successful life.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Don't tell me I can't do it; don't tell me it can't be done!""","""The Aviator"" is a biographical drama, which follows the life of filmmaker and aviator Howard Hughes, from the 1920s to the 1940s. Although today he's better known for films (""Hell's Angels"", ""Scarface"", ""The Outlaw""), ""The Aviator"" deals more with Hughes' shifting boundaries in aviation and his private life, which marked love (Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner) and political affairs, as well as a serious form of OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) and germophobia.Even if you don't know what the film is about, or even what genre it belongs to, sound names like director Martin Scorsese, a phenomenal cast consisting of Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Jude Law, music by Howard Shore, and even five Oscars (out of a total of 11 nominations), are reason enough to watch it.Scorsese made an effort that each part of the film looked as close as possible to the films of the period in which it takes place, which is especially impressive at the beginning, for example in the scene in which Jude Law appears as Errol Flynn. This is probably the main reason for the Best Cinematography Oscar, which went to Robert Richardson, with whom Scorsese has already collaborated on the films ""Casino"" and ""Bringing Out the Dead"".DiCaprio, as usual, deserved an Oscar and remained only on the nomination. Cate Blanchett gave her best to mimic the mannerism and accent of Katharine Hepburn, but, although she deserved an Oscar for acting, her appearance is not even close to the beauty of the legendary Katharine. Admittedly, Kate irritates me, so my objectivity is questionable. It is interesting that with this role, she became the first person to win an Oscar by playing another Oscar winner. Kate Beckinsale is as enchanting as ever, and John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda (also nominated), and Ian Holm give the film an impressive charm.Technically, the film is top-notch in every aspect, but it lacks essence. It consists of parts perfectly made and put together, and it doesn't lack even emotional strength, but it has no point, leads nowhere, ends abruptly, and even with some sort of cliffhanger. I enjoyed every minute of its three hours, but it lacks something essential that would complement technical perfection and make it a timeless masterpiece.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""The way of the future..""","This was a great movie that kept getting better throughout until it couldn't possibly get any better.It is about the early life of the director and aviator (hence the title; ""the aviator"") Howard Hughes. It shows a lot of the making of Hell's Angels, and it shows his severe, yet undiagnosed OCD that seemingly gets progressively worse, as well as his relationship with Katherine.As with a lot of biopics I have reviewed, the acting is perfection, which does not come as a surprise to me, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, and John C. Reily all have important roles in the movie. And obviously they all do a fantastic job.As for the cinematography, I love everything regarding the audio. The sound quality is great, as well as the sound effects, the volume, and the soundtrack, especially the soundtrack. The visuals are good as well, It has reasonable visual quality, as well as real-looking visual effects.For the realism, I did some research and it is among the most realistic biopics I have ever seen (along with Ray and Milk). There are very few completely dramatized scenes in the movie, which is very surprising seen as it is a 2 hour and 50 minute movie.For the emotional impact, seeing Hughes get progressively worse is hard to watch (in a good way). It is very realistic, and DiCaprio does a great job at portraying it. It is sad, mildly disturbing.For the entertainment, I am glad to say that the movie absolutely passes this factor as well. In the beginning, it is slow, and you don't know where the movie is going because it seems like the whole movie will be about a guy getting 2 extra cameras. But he then meets Katherine, and it gets very entertaining from there. And I am by no means saying the beginning is bad, I am just saying it lacks the entertainment that the rest of the movie has. It is still great to watch, there is also some pretty good dark comedy towards the beginning, and the 2 hours and 50 minutes end up feeling like nothing more than 1 hour and 45 minutes.And the ending...fantastic, is all I have to say.Conclusion:

Fly Me to the Moon,"Once upon a time, Howard Hughes was one of the richest men in the world. He owned a major Hollywood studio, an international airline and half of Las Vegas.

The Aviator,"The Aviator, is based on the true life story of Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes, was very eccentric and he directed such films as Hell's Angels and Scarface.

Howard, also dated a lot of women including actress Katharine Hepburn, and later in his life he lived mostly in a hotel room running his business from there. The Aviator, has good direction, a good script, good performances by everyone involved (especially Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Howard Hughes), good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration and good costume design. The film is made by director Martin Scorsese, who I like very much as a filmmaker but I wasn't very impressed with his last film Gangs Of New York.

The Aviator Review.,"The Aviator is a true story based on the life of billionaire aviator and film producer, Howard Hughes.

DiCaprio really demonstrated a perfect example of someone Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, so well in fact that it earned him his second Oscar Nomination in 2004. Also stellar performances by Cate Blanchette who won the Oscar that year as the beautiful actress Katharine Hepburn. I was very impressed with her in this movie as she was so flawlessly realistic with her characters personality. I was also very impressed with Alan Alda's honest performance; he also received an Oscar nomination. Over all, this film leaves you with a sighing wow.

Solid Movie about Howard Hughes.,"Okay, I'm still recovering from ""The Titanic"" debacle, so I didn't buy into Leonardo Di Caprio playing Howard Hughes, and although Kate Blanchett's portrayal of Kathryn Hepburn was shrill and annoying, and the pseudo-psychology used to explain Mr. Hughes's idiosyncrasies were flat-out crude and ludicrous, and the scene where Mr. Hughes is staggering around in his hotel room naked utterly devoid of any entertainment value, still this is a solid movie. It's a solid movie because of the life of Howard Hughes itself. The story of Howard Hughes is not his mental illness, nor his affair with Kathryn Hepburn, nor his run-in with Congress. Rather the story of Howard Hughes is about what Hughes did, what he built, what he accomplished, what an incredibly great and gifted man he was. He was rich man, but he was also a worker, a test pilot, a builder, an innovator, an inventor, as well as a pioneer Hollywood producer and director. No matter how hard this movie tries to portray Mr. Hughes as some kind of oddball, and no matter how unbelievable and superficial is Mr. Di Caprio's portrayal of Howard Hughes, the man's accomplishments could not be ignored or denigrated, even in this movie, and they speak for themselves.

Great Tribute to An American Oddball,"I was thirteen when Titanic came out, so I will always have a soft spot for Leo. I admire him because he's a guy who could have coasted on his looks alone, but he always chooses his roles carefully. He's one of those actors whose films you can depend on to at least be interesting in some way. As Howard Hughes, you watch a man who has everything (looks, money, intelligence, creativity) but will lose it all to mental illness. I love how clear it is that Howard knows he is not normal, but is powerless to control himself. I can't think of another movie or television show that portrays OCD with as much respect.While Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific as Howard, the person who really shines in this film is Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, who won an Oscar for her performance. The film portrays Hepburn as the only woman who could bring out the tender side of Howard and the only person who could get him to relax enough to have some fun. Cate does a great job of channeling this icon, to the point where I think of this performance whenever I watch one of the real Hepburn's films.http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/03/12/the-aviator",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Aviator talks beautifully about the guy who pioneered aviation. His actions, through THIS film, will set a role.Leonardo DiCaprio is a maverick. His Oscar loss is the brightest example of flawed judgment. The way he lives as Hughes in this biopic is beyond anyone's skill or repertoire. And his interpretation of OCD, coupled with startling agony is one of the many genius antics he does and amuses in this film. With a beaming supporting cast and very-well written plot, the film advances good in the first hour. Then as the camera focuses on the personality & his disorders & thoughts, the screenplay quite makes it boring at two or three nodes. And although it has nothing to do with the 170 minute run-time, the dullness is the only bad thing about it.With complementing music and apt direction for such a biopic, Martin Scorsese proves that he is one of the phenomenal directors of all time.

An Inspirational Film!,"When I watched ""The Aviator"" for the first time over a year ago, I have to say I really liked it. Leonardo Dicaprio does great playing Howard Hughes as does Cate Blanchett with Catherine Hepburn. The film is great all the way through. The filmmakers did an awesome job of making the 1930's-1940's style backgrounds. I have to say I didn't know anything about Howard Hughes until I saw this movie based on his life. I'm serious! Although, I have to point out that the language is rather a big disappointment. In addition to the unnecessary f-word used by Alec Baldwin's character. Leo's character as well as almost everyone else in the movie says ""godd--n"" nonstop, and more than half the time it's not necessary either. But, despite that ""the Aviator"" is a great film.

It looks as if the movie was put together of little pieces, like different news stories... It's up to audience to put together the big picture. Which I liked the best was the unpredictability of the script. It is impossible to know even what happens in 10 minutes, everything the cast says or does is a surprise. Leo does a fantastic job in the leading role, giving the perfect impression of a complex character. Also, Cate Blanchett is absolutely terrific. She shows Katherine Hepburn realistically, adding a little bit of humor. Special effects are incredible, they spice up the film but don't draw the attention from the script.

Fantastic movie and fantastic portrayal of OCD,"First of all, this movie is very beautifully shot (especially towards the end), very well plotted out and acted, and very entertaining. Cate Blanchette, for example, shines in her role as Katherine Hepburn, as does Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes. You can really see how Cate's character brought some sanity into Howard's spiraling mental state.But far more important than that, to me, is this movie's depiction of ocd. It is probably the most accurate portrayal i have ever seen. As someone who has suffered with ocd for most of my life, seeing so many of the tics and eccentricities I've dealt with be shown onscreen in such a real way is incredibly refreshing. I'm sure the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio has ocd himself helped him bring realism to the role. I would honestly recommend this movie for the look on his face alone when his symptoms are triggered. I swear I've never felt so understood.Many scenes showing his symptoms may come across as a bit humorous and outlandish to people who don't have this condition, but I can assure you that they are very real.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"This is the way of Scorsese, the way of Scorsese, the way of Scorsese, the way of Sc...","It doesn't have the look, the style, but when the movie is over, you realize this is a cinematic experience like only Marty could have provided: a huge and dazzlingly decadent celebration of the American Dream from the mature -but never cynical- perspective of a true patriot. This good American is no one else but Howard Hugues, a precocious pioneer who has everything: he's rich, he's an aviator and a real one -this is no Frank Abagnale- and he's handsome. And no one but Leonardo Di Caprio could have embodied these 'no contradictions', and made me so doubtful that such a story would inspire me I'm glad I was wrongThe thing when you're a fan of Scorsese, you try to find a bit of Travis Bickle or ""Goodfellas"" in every film he made since, especially the latest ones  movies whose masterful confidence in the directing and flamboyant ambition in the story almost worked as obstacles for the Scorsesian touch. When I was watching the scene where Howard Hugues, the handsome playboy, makes Jean Harlow literally melt of desire, I totally forgot about the first scene, where he was spelling the word QUARANTINE with his mother (?), probably the origin of his obsession with cleanliness. I forgot about this scene and I thought, okay, here he comes, the handsome guy will get the pretty doll, pretty dull, isn't it? Leo would play Leo all through the film, whose only redeeming qualities would be the beautiful and convincing recreation of Hollywood's Golden Age, and the incredible characterization of Katharine Hepburn by Cate Blanchett. Thankfully, these fears didn't last, when I realized how truly Scorsesian was our lead character, and that the success story is less due to luck, or gift, than to a sublimated obsession.Obsession, this is what drives Howard Hugues, not ambition, because in a way, ambition admits the possibility of failing. But the obsession of Howard is not to fail, it's to win, it's to build the best planes and to make the best movies. Don't call it perfectionism, this word is absent from his vocabulary, for nothing can be too perfect for him. It's simple; either Howard Hugues is the craziest character ever or the most inspiring. When the movie starts growing on you, you realize he's both, and that each of these sides of his personality drives the other. Scorsesian characters have this in common; they look straight-forward to escape from that thing behind, haunting them  The source of the psychological torment, always rooted in the spirit of the character, creates either noble or despicable motives, but in both cases, everything has a point, and everything has a reason. The question is: where will this lead? To the top, or to the fall  Let's just say, that ""Aviator"" is the story of a character whose Scorsesian condition leads to the top, literallyThe inspirational aspect of ""The Aviator"" is how it reconciles with the idea, almost a cliché, that whatever doesn't kill you makes you strongest  and that your very flaws or so-called weaknesses shall never be hidden or repressed because they might be the key of your personal accomplishment. Your difference is your strength. The film is about the transcending craziness into an gigantic ambition, so out of proportions, that only in America, it can work it's the idea that nothing is impossible. It's almost pretentious, as if Scorsese defended the idea that only tormented men made the world, but is he wrong? Let's face it, for goodness or badness, this world has been built by men with visions  and Howard Hugues had these visions, this extra sensibility that transformed his paranoia into a prophetic capability.And these obsessions, tormenting the mind of Howard Hugues: cleanliness, perfection, repeating the same sentences, were not an invitation to label him as crazy. Calling him this way is missing the point, he's not crazy, he's simply alienated by his obsession of perfection, the idea behind Howard Hugues' story is that when we want to become something, that something finally becomes us. Clean, perfect, efficient, everything must obey to a total physical and spiritual harmony and it does drive you crazy  this is the maddening yang of the successful yin. For each construction, there is a destruction, a gargantuan plane flying has cost many others to crash, for every kiss with a star, Jean, Kate, Ava or Jane, there was a rib broken, or a burnt skin. If it wasn't for all the flash, and all the distracting Hollywood's portrayal, this would probably be the deepest and most philosophical Marty's film.I reckon I felt immediate empathy to Howard Hugues as soon as I got the gravity of his obsession, because I could put myself in his shoes, and I liked him, even more because I hated him first, I was jealous, it's like I wanted him to get a comeuppance for a fault he didn't commit. But this strengthened my empathy even more, and the more he got hit, the more enthusiastic I was, when I could see him hit back. Because he illustrated the struggle of the mad but inspiring visionary facet of the American dream to overcome its most perverse aspect: thirst for monopoly and financial power. It's not TWA vs. Pan Am, its two American philosophies confronting each other in a Scorsesian arena.It's almost a referential film, as if Scorsese uses this character as a therapy to justify how his own obsession with a certain idea of film-making, was the key for his personal salvation, and a blessing for Cinema  I felt like feeling the spirit of the 70's Marty  and even Leo kind of reminded me of Robert De Niro at one point, in a performance that blew me away  ""The Aviator"" is one of Marty's greatest films!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent in all respects with one minor quibble,"It's still a ten, but: what's with GWEN STEFANI as Jean Harlow? That's a huge miscast. Harlow, for one thing, had BLUE EYES. They didn't even bother to give Stefani contact lenses.Harlow was wide-jawed and had high Nordic cheekbones. Gwen Stefani is a skinny Italian chick with a pinched little face and close-set eyes.Stefani is not a natural blonde, never was. Jean Harlow was a natural blonde.Jean Harlow had a more robust build; Stefani is a scrawny-throated, bony gaggling chicken.Kirsten Dunst would have been a MUCH better choice. Even Reese Witherspoon would have done better. This was a tribal choice, not an artistic one. Or else Gwennie was doing someone.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Deserves the Oscar,"I didn't know there were already two movies titled ""The Aviator"", one with Christopher Reeve in 1985.This is a great movie. It really deserves the award for ""Best Picture"". The special effects were spectacular, the soundtrack flawless, and the acting surprisingly great. Everything about this movie flowed so nicely. Howard Hughes himself was so over-the-top, so the movie could glide smoothly through the story of his life without having to over-dramatize anything. Classy film-making here; kind of a like a new version of Citizen Kane... It'd be awfully lame if someone made a new version of Citizen Kane, so this is the closest you can get to having a new epic story like that. Also kudos to DiCaprio on his acting job. I do however, think Jamie Foxx deserves the Oscar for ""Best Actor"" but Clint Eastwood will most likely get it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
a mad genius,"You really can't miss when doing a biography of Howard Hughes, certainly one of the most brilliant, glamorous, eccentric, and fascinating men who ever lived. And for me, Leonardo DiCaprio and Scorcese don't miss. DiCaprio's portrayal of Hughes is a revelation. (I'll digress here to say, for those who have accused him of being short, I've seen him in person - he's not short.) He does a fantastic job as Hughes. You can almost hear his inner dialogue. As for Scorcese, the movie is truly spectacular in its breadth.I was disappointed in a couple of elements. One was, with the care Cate Blanchett gave to her portrayal of Hepburn, one would have hoped that a little attention had been paid to the casting of the other women in Hughes' life: Faith Domergue, Ava Gardner, Jean Harlow. Of the three, I liked Kate Beckinsale's Ava the best - but for me, Ava Gardner's beauty is unparalleled. Beckinsale really didn't approach it. And Stefani was wrong, wrong, wrong. How hard can it be to find a young actress (and Harlow was 19, not 35, when she appeared in Hell's Angel's), and slap a platinum wig and a white clinging gown on her? Harlow's look was very distinctive, and when it's off, it's distracting.The other thing I was disappointed in - and I suppose this couldn't be helped in a way - was the telescoping of the years and some unnecessary inaccuracies. I don't pretend to be an expert on Hughes. I've seen one documentary on him which was fantastic, and now I want to read about him. But Katharine Hepburn talks about the press showing up at her brother's funeral - I don't know why that would have been, since she wasn't famous yet. I realize her family was prominent, but she made it sound as if it had to do with her fame. She also labels herself as Box Office Poison way too soon, and the movie skips the entire Philadelphia Story, including Hughes giving her the money to buy the rights. No mention of most of the controversy over ""The Outlaw"" which took several years to see a release.But these are minor, nitpicky points. This is a big, gorgeous film, with exciting, lush scenes and some fantastic performances.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
