Tale of Two,"The Lobster is a curious film with shades of the Coen Brothers or Grand Hotel Budapest (the fact that so much is set in a hotel is incidental, or hotels in movies are places to be avoided). Dysfunctional characters drift through, delivering their lines with humorous lack of awareness and emotion, strange rituals are performed to bond the guests, and all the time the clock is ticking - find a partner, become a couple, within 45 days or be turned into an animal of your choice.The first part of the film is amusing, quirky and entertaining. The style is pleasant and interesting, despite some nasty moments. Some of the shots drag a little, but it adds to the curious atmosphere. The dry, deadpan dialogue is perfectly delivered, Colin Farrell as the main protagonist shows he really is a fine actor.Then the film changes. New characters are introduced and the mood becomes much bleaker. No longer is this humorous, the stakes have changed. It is hard to identify with the new characters as we had already invested emotion in the earlier ones. And it gets worse, leading to en ending that is as unclear as it is unpleasant.The Lobster cannot seem to make up its mind what kind of a film it is, is it simply saying that we are all venal and craven in the end? If so, why the humour at the beginning? And if we are capable of love, is it really so shallow as to be broken by people saying things?I loved the beginning, I didn't like the end. This was one fish dish that left a bad taste.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Cleverly original, scathing, and sharp – even if the oddity of it all did make it hard to penetrate","I had heard reviews of The Lobster and, while sounding interesting, it also sounded odd enough to delay me in getting round to seeing it. Like many have said, the plot is weird; single people are sent to a hotel and given a period of time to find a match or else they will be turned into the creature of their choosing and released to the wild. Those struggling can add days to their stay by being successful on hunts for those singles who have broken free and live as collective individuals in the woods.The concept is cleverly constructed so that it is weirdly convincing despite its utter absurdity. Within this the film satirizes relationships, singles – in particular the extremes of those two situations. The push for companionship, with its common ground, and its rituals, and the digs at elements of life such as children distracting from conflict. Perhaps it hit a bit too close to home with its regimented rituals, and awkward neediness. On the other side the extreme version of singlehood is also dug at once we are in the woods. It is not as clever as some would tell you, nor as smart, but it is certainly interesting, darkly funny, and pretty engaging throughout. It doesn't pull it off totally, but I enjoyed it from start to finish – its oddity runs through from the ideas, the performances, down into the specific dialogue. Having such a great cast helps, but the tightness of creative vision throughout is what holds it all together. As odd and slightly unsuccessful as it is, it is still well worth watching.",,Anonymous,Romance
Easily the weirdest film you'll see all year,"There's no chance that you'll see a film as weird as The Lobster this whole year. In what is effectively an indie art-house piece, you get a completely insane and almost unfathomable world filled with more and more absurdities everywhere you look. However, it's such an incredibly unique and eye-catching film that it's still hugely engrossing and surprisingly entertaining to watch.The story centres around one man, played by Colin Farrell, as he attempts to find a partner as a part of this bizarre system. The first act revolves around his time in 'The Hotel', and is not only hugely odd, but both dramatic and unnerving as well as hilarious to watch, featuring some of the best dark comedy written in years.The film takes its story as seriously as any drama, and you feel that through the deeply disturbing atmosphere that emerges off the screen. However, as the film is just so weird, it eases you into the oddness of it all very impressively through the use of humour, something that more pretentious art-house films fail to do, and are resultantly a lot harder to really get into.So, you'll definitely be laughing a lot, if not in a more disturbed than hugely entertained manner, throughout the first act, and by the end of it, you'll surely be as used as you can be to the incredibly weird feel of this whole film.Just to give you an idea of how unorthodox this film is, every scene is full of awkward silences, the actors speak as if they're reading off of cue cards with no emotion whatsoever, the imagery is very ugly and unpleasant to look at right the way through, and the incredible slow pace of it all means that the film feels like it goes on for about five times as long as it actually does.And yet, I still can't get around the fact that this is a brilliant film. Mainly, it's the fact that it's just so unique and almost shockingly bizarre, but it's just filled with so many captivating ideas that it's impossible not to be fully drawn into this insane story.So, the performances, the directing, the writing, and pretty much everything is stunning, apart from one big issue that prevents this from being a truly incredible film. Following the end of the first act, the film does lose its way quite a lot, taking almost too big a leap into an even stranger abyss than you ever imagined at the beginning, and, with a little less humour in the latter stages, isn't as easy to watch as the first act had been.However, it does pick up again towards a terrifying and as bizarre as ever conclusion, and that's why I'm going to give The Lobster a 9 out of 10, but I must warn you that if you feel you can't cope with this film for longer than the first twenty minutes, then it's not for you. This is definitely a cult film for the ages, but won't be a big hit with general audiences.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Absurdist Screwball Comedy,"The Lobster is a surreal deadpan comedy about the strangeness of social pressures and modern relationships.The setting is a bleak, tightly controlled hotel on the coast of Ireland. David (Colin Farrell), a recently divorced Architect, is given 40 days to find a partner or else be transformed into an animal of his choosing; in this case, a lobster. Sound strange? That's just the first 10 minutes. Guests of the hotel are subjected to routine trips to shoot 'loners' with tranquillisers, and awkward high-school dances to entice singles to mingle. As David's days start running out, he decides to feign common interest with a heartless woman in order to escape his fate. But can he pull it off?Farrell really hits the mark with this role, displaying awkward machismo and fragile humility in equal measure. His comedic timing is matched only by his supporting cast that includes John C. Reilly, Ashley Jensen, and Olivia Coleman. Rachel Weisz is also spot-on as the short-sighted woman.The Lobster has just about everything you'd want from a film. It's unpredictable, it's offbeat, and it's laugh-out-loud funny. But it's most impressive feature is the subtext - it manages to reflect how odd our own modern-day social pressures are. How loneliness is feared, how individuality loses out to the mainstream system, and how relationships have to be deemed 'legitimate' by some higher order. There's plenty to talk about with this film, and I'll definitely be seeing it again to delve a little deeper....",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Quirky and original, slow film","The film's concept: all adults who have recently lost a partner through death or divorce are sent to a hotel, where if they do not fall in love within 45 days, they are surgically transformed into an animal of their choosing. ''A lobster's a great choice''.I try not to explain the film's plot when somebody asks, so as not to completely dissuade them from viewing. Maybe this ridiculous concept is in reference to how ridiculous forcing someone to fall in love due to common interests is, or even just forcing someone to eventually get married, a practice common in the modern world. A comment on the societal pressures put on single adults. There are constant references and reminders to how even numbers are perfect, a couple. There is a further commentary on applying limiting labels and boxes to people, bisexual not being an option on the sexuality question, no half-sized shoes.Collin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, along with the many minor characters, all add to the film greatly. There are no weak actors which I could point out. The screen writing can be fast and witty at times, but I felt the ''quirkiness'' was definitely overdone. The robotic and monotonous speech pattern was generally funny but also overdone.I have spoken to many people who do not enjoy this film, and I can definitely respect and understand their opinion. The Lobster is not for everyone, with it's strange plot, writing and imagery. It's script is similar to that of a Wes Anderson film, but still remains very dark, and at times, disturbing. It is without a doubt, a slow film, heavily reliant on dialogue (which many people won't even find funny).I would recommend the film to people who enjoy quirky films such as Frank, Juno or The Grand Budapest Hotel, although The Lobster is definitely darker than those examples.Probably one of the strangest film I've ever watched.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A remarkable oddity of a film,"""The Lobster"" takes the tropes and expectations of modern-day relationships and satirises them almost out of existence. The farcical ""Hotel"" aims to partner 'loner' humans with each other (based on 1 characteristic) in a stress-inducing timeframe of 45 days, often resulting in deception and the suppression of true feelings in order to garner a relationship as a means of escape. The other side of the coin is the outcast tribe living a meagre existence in the woods, where even flirting is punished with physical mutilation. The cold mechanical delivery of every single character's lines emphasises the absurdity of the situation, and bizarrely makes the jokes even funnier. Not since Richard Ayoade's ""The Double"" has cripplingly awkward humour been so effective. This film has a lot to say about the fickle nature of relationships, set against the background of a dystopian society. The cinematography is as flat as the actors' delivery; this contributes to the emotionally-stunted, often silent world that the characters inhabit. The ending is beautifully ambiguous and surprisingly tense for such an understated scene. A score which fluctuates from terse, rough string melodies to Italian opera heightens the sense of weird-art-film which pervades ""The Lobster"": definitely a film which requires full attention, reflection, and a mind open to arty weirdness, ""The Lobster"" is a remarkable oddity.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Lobster: The Absurdist Brilliance of Yorgos Lanthimos,"In a world where staying single is a breach of acceptable social norms, single people are isolated in a hotel and forced to find a partner in 45 days otherwise they will be turned into an animal of their choosing. People who somehow manage to escape to the woods are called 'loners' and are occasionally hunted by the hotel dwellers. An incongruous story that must have made Kafka dance in his grave, not only because it breaks away from logic but because it takes the absurd to a new level of significance. The Lobster has all elements of absurdist fiction – dark humor, irrationality, and cynicism, add to that a lurking social criticism that hits your mind and soul hard. The narrative is constructed in a way that lures you into giving up all your logical defenses after the first few minutes and totally surrender to the surreality of events. I truly envy writer and director Yorgos Lanthimos for having a mind that can come up with such twisted and brilliant stories.If you have to choose between pretending to have feelings when you don't and pretending not to have feelings when you do, which would you prefer? This seems to be the kernel question of the film. The hotel dwellers are forced to pretend they have feelings for people in order to avoid being turned into animals. On the other hand, the loners are banned from showing feelings for each other even if they do. This absurd conundrum levels harsh criticism against a society that advocates binary opposition, an inherent concept that has become part and parcel of the human belief system of love and relationships as well. From the beginning of the film, it is made clear that there are no gray areas in this world; you're either heterosexual or homosexual, a size 44 or a size 45. It might not be that severe in the real world, but emotional extremism is just as bad. If you are in a relationship, you are expected to love to the fullest, and if you appreciate isolation and individuality, you are stigmatized as a heartless loner all the way through. Whatever you choose, you have to bend your personality or change something in yourself to fit in either group. In the film, this forced appropriation takes an emotional and a physical form, and it keeps you wondering which leaves more permanent scars, emotional or physical transformation? The story disparages a society that fails to acknowledge the paradoxical human condition – humans need company, yet they are innately loners; they love other people, yet they love themselves more; they have feelings, yet feelings are not meant to last forever; they are spiritual, yet predominantly physical. A world that fails to recognize this complexity is a pathetic, oppressive place.As usual, Lanthimos' script is funny, iaconic and strikingly smart; all the dialogues are meaningful despite their seeming absurdity, and the scenes are meticulously written to contribute to the intricate world of the story and its underlying intended significance. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when the hotel manager (Olivia Colman) visits David (Colin Farrell) in his room and tells him that he has to carefully choose the animal he wants to turn into because, as an animal, he won't be able to have a sexual relationship with an animal of a different species, something that he can't already do as a human being since he has to find a 'matching' partner. The whole conversation is very humorous and absurd, and the joke continues as we see how people strive hard to find matching qualities in their partners including nosebleeds, limps, good voice, shortsightedness and lack of emotions. An extremely elaborate and cunning joke that deconstructs the myth of soulmate.I think the acting is great and one of the main sources of dark humor and irony in the film. Imagine a story about love and relationships where actors don't show a single hint of emotions and talk and walk like constipated corpses most of the time. Martin McDonagh has already rediscovered Colin Farrell as a comedian in In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths and it is always nice to see another director picking up on that streak. Ben Whishaw and Aggeliki Papoulia are notably spectacular.As if it isn't enough for Lanthimos to subvert storytelling and acting norms, he seems to play with artistic trends too. If you are familiar with the Lars von Trier's cinematographic experimentation (Antichrist and Melancholia in particular), you will see how Lanthimos uses slow motion and classic music to create a grandiose effect that stands in a hilarious contrast with the event taking place on the screen.The Lobster is another must-watch multilayered witty narrative from the impeccable imaginarium of Yorgos Lanthimos.It went straight to my heart and to my all-time favorite films list.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dogma Eat Dogma...,"There are rules that you must follow every day, quite contradictory, depending where you stay, some encourage you to mingle, others like you to stay single, contravention has a hefty price to pay. No evidence exists for these directions, though they're pursued by folk with little hesitation, but occasionally you'll see, someone escape and run and flee, as they wish to play, by other regulations.A wonderful piece of filmmaking, that perfectly captures the often ridiculous actions, activities and exertions we all undertake, to a certain degree, in order to comply with the beliefs that are indoctrinated into us from a very early age and, if you're lucky, able to wash away, as the pretence is discovered and replaced by those carefully recrafted by yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Weird, Whacky & Wicked But Also Dull, Sterile & Vapid.","Weird, whacky & wicked but equally dull, sterile & vapid, The Lobster is a strange beast that actually begins quite well but tumbles down the road after the halfway mark to conclude on a rather uninteresting note. The concept is no doubt intriguing and it takes its time to make us familiar to the society inhabiting its tale but all of it doesn't amount to much in the end & it fails to leave any lasting impression.Set in a dystopian future, The Lobster presents a world in which single people are arrested & taken to a hotel where they are obliged to find a matching partner within 45 days or they are transformed into animals & released into the woods. The plot follows David who arrives at the hotel for the same reason but his endeavours of finding a mate before his time is over ends far more tragically than he expected.Co-written & directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, The Lobster marks his English-language debut and the idea & inspiration behind it is both clever & admirable. The sequences taking place in the hotel are nicely carried out but its second half lacks the same level of creativity that's present in the first half. The excitement goes missing once the protagonist leaves the hotel and from there on, it just limps throughout its remaining runtime.The hotel is neatly maintained but it also has a creepy vibe about it. Camera movements are fluid, colour hues wonderfully compliment its overcast ambiance and lighting seems natural for the most part. Editing allows the plot to unfold at an unhurried pace but the whole story feels twice as long because of that, with no idea of where it's headed. Last, the background score is just as odd as the story's content and is intermittently utilised.Coming to the performances, The Lobster features a fine cast in Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw & John C. Reilly and most of them are simply bland & lifeless in their respective roles. It can be argued that the spiritless rendition of these scripted people was deliberate but it doesn't really help in enriching the experience, at all. The deadpan wit is occasionally amusing but it's also too easy to get frustrated by whatever is happening.On an overall scale, The Lobster is an uncanny mix of bizarre ideas that, in its effort to play with multiple things at once, may end up drifting many of its viewers. While I found nothing lovable about it, its parody of the society that gives way too much credit to companionship, in addition to the dig it takes at those match-making algorithms which rely on similar traits & likeness factor is one aspect I liked but in all seriousness, The Lobster is too mediocre to be of any significance.",,Anonymous,Romance
strange with a point of view,David (Colin Farrell) is taken to an isolated hotel. His wife has just left him. The hotel clients have 45 days to find a partner before they are turned into an animal. David's dog is his brother after failing to find a match. He selects to be changed into a lobster. There are particular rules and planned events to the hotel.This is one strange movie. It does have an internal logic which it is able to keep. It's weirdly funny at times. The deadpan mannerism doesn't keep the movie static. It is able to maintain a compelling story despite its peculiar world. This movie has ideas and it stays with them. Yorgos Lanthimos and his collaborator Efthymis Filippou have done some weird stuff like Dogtooth. This one is able to recruit top shelf acting talents. The second half gets over-extended as it tries to expand the world. The hotel is such a curious place that I would rather stay there for the whole movie.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The Michael Bay of ""art"" movies; unoriginal, superficial and boring.","I like slow movies, I like (not exclusively) movies that are different, and I have enjoyed movies that were wacky just for the sake of it.But this movie is just pointless. Just like a Michael Bay movie is a series of disjointed superficial action scenes, just there to show CGI and huge explosions, this movie is a series of disjointed ""artsy"" scenes, just to show the audience superficial weirdness, not even for the sake of it.There is no depth to anything.I see many people compare this movie to Wes Anderson's movies (as well as various other directors of similar genre). The problem is that these directors use certain framing, lighting, slow motion etc, and certain narrative techniques for a reason. They are there to tell you something, they set up some emotional connection, they tell you about a character, they set a mood important for the story, etc. etc.Without going into spoilers, there is no point to many things in the movie. You can easily just leave many scenes, techniques and characters out, or rearrange them, it wouldn't make any difference, because they have no meaning. They are just randomly there to be weird character ""A"", and absurd situation ""4"". While other things are just cheap setups for cliché payoffs without any connection to the story or each other.The more I think about this movie, the more superficial and flat it becomes. Some people call the movie pretentious, but it isn't even that. There is nothing there for it to be pretentious about.I""m forced to give it some stars because the movie doesn't even do us the decency of being bad. The actors know how to act, the camera man knows how to operate the camera, and the man in the cutting room knows how to cut, the locations are well chosen, and the director directed.

Emotive and conceptually engaging. MUST SEE...,"Being a Yorgos Lanthimos virgin, I was attracted to the title by its quirky premise and interesting cast list. I approached with cautious optimism, hoping to find a gem at the very least. What I found instead was a cinematic treasure trove.The Lobster follows David (Colin Farrel) in a society where it is unacceptable to be single. When David's wife leaves him he is sent to The Hotel where he has 45 days to find a partner. If he finds one - awesome. If he fails, he will be turned into an animal. Of his choice, naturally.It's stylish, it's got technique, it's disorienting (in a good way), it asks questions about us and doesn't really care about hearing our answers. It instills within you the great sense of uneasiness that the characters must feel in this collection of increasingly odd situations through stilted, brutally frank dialogue in a masterclass of a script. The performances, also, are stunning. I was pleasantly surprised by Rachel Weisz in her subtly moving role as the Short Sighted Woman.Having watched it no more than five hours ago, I find myself recalling it as if it was a dream. The carefully considered combination of editing and cinematography gives the feature that lifted, slightly angled and unaligned feel. Its world presents itself to you in a disembodied kind of way and, in the way you may leave your bed after a dream, you will leave the cinema questioning everything about it.I can honestly say The Lobster has entered the ranks of my favourite films. Go and catch this while it's still in cinemas - the critically thirsty mind will not remain unquenched.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A beautiful dream with Colin Farrell's best screen role ever...,"It took some time to let Yorgos Lanthimos' new film ""The Lobster""  settle into my mind. On the surface is a dark comedy, full of rich  images, and staggering performances from its principal cast. Deeper  lays one of the most original and heart wrenching stories on modern  relationships, likely the best seen in film since Michel Gondry's  ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""  ""The Lobster"" tells the story of a dystopian near future, where single  people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel,  where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty- five days  or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods. At the  center is David (played by Colin Farrell), who enters the Hotel with  his brother, who's been turned into a dog, and begins a domino effect  that will make him both an outcast and a fugitive.  Beginning with a hilarious and smart script by Lanthimos and co- writer  Efthymis Filippou, ""The Lobster"" gets some of the year's biggest  laughs. The two create a symphony of truth about our society's  perception of relationships and love. When David first enters the  hotel, you can see the initial despair and fight against the system. He  believes in the idea of love but isn't particularly fond of being under  its spell once again. Its simply life and death but when the story  makes him an outcast, where love is forbidden, you see his hopeless  romantic self become drawn to his ""Short Sighted Woman."" (played by  Rachel Weisz) The evolution of David's outlook on his current situation  is authentic and real, as he shows the center of his heartache in only  intermittent spurts. You can thank all that to the powerhouse  performance by Colin Farrell, who delivers his best and most audacious  film role to date.  ""The Lobster"" isn't just about its script and lead performer. It also  assembles one of the year's best cast ensembles. Rachel Weisz is a  sensation, giving her best work since her Oscar-winning role in ""The  Constant Gardener."" As the ""Lisping Man,"" its refreshing to see John C.  Reilly dig deep into a role like this, one of which we haven't seen  from him in nearly a decade. As the ""Limping Man,"" Ben Whishaw  continues to build an arsenal of titanic-like performances, all of  which solidifies him as one of the best kept secrets working today.  More roles for him please. As the ""Loner Leader,"" Léa Seydoux's  villainous and vile demeanor is a fantastical addition, adding a needed  depth and danger to the film and role. Olivia Colman's Hotel Manager is  a bonus treat, as she effortlessly brings chuckles and fear to her  mystery woman.  Cinematographer Thimios Bakatakis finds his stride and vision early on,  capturing an aesthetic that is both stylized and advantageous. The  visual contrast is dazzling and particularly noteworthy but what's  lurking between each and every frame is especially dynamic and robust.  One of the year's very best. Upon first viewing, Yorgos Mavropsaridis'  editing work can seem bloated but over 24 hours later, it's a taut and  vivaciously engaging piece, cut with a resemblance of Jeff Buchanan and  Eric Zumbrunnen's snubbed work on Spike Jonze's ""Her."" The score is  insanely haunting and very appropriate for its dark natured comic look  at life.  It took some time to digest but ""The Lobster"" feels full of life and is  a soulful opus on love. Quirky and clever, its black comic tones  shouldn't distract from its core narrative and mission; to engage the  parimeters and infatuation of devotion. Just a dream.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Totally awful.,"So bereft of any human emotion, The Lobster sacrifices everything in an attempt to be ""absurdist dark comedy"", and fails in every single aspect. Most of the film consists of awfully written dialogue, unnecessarily long shots, and it tries so unbelievably hard to be artistic that it loses any sight of what a film should actually be, and is so ridiculously boring. The plot of the film is hard to describe, but it just pisses me off how often it tries to make the plot ""interesting"", by throwing in characters, or shots that are added just to confuse the viewer. Most of the film has cruel intentions, throwing people off of buildings, only to suffer to death, kicking dogs to death, and blinding people for seemingly no reason. This film is not funny at all. I laughed maybe once or twice, but only because the film was so bad. I hate this artistic garbage, and it seriously felt so preachy, boring, and unfunny. I dislike this movie so very much, because it's very bad, but it thinks it's so good.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Novel idea...and that's all,"Set in a dystopian, fascist future, single people are sent to a hotel where they must find a partner in 45 days or get turned into a wild animal of their choice. David's wife has just left him, after 11 years of marriage, and he is sent the hotel. His chosen animal, should he not find a partner, is a lobster.Quite intriguing, initially. The whole idea and set up was so inane you felt compelled to stick with it. The sheer novelty of it all sucks you in.However, almost as quickly, the cracks in the concept and plot start to appear. Why do people go along with the preposterous idea? If they are forced to find a partner, why not just find anyone and pretend to be a couple, rather than suffer this fate? While obviously the central idea is quite ridiculous, it is the way people respond to it that is truly implausible and sets the movie up to fail.Also, why does the opposite of this ""couples are everything"" regime have to be a ""being a perpetual loner is the only way to go"" group. Surely there can be a middle ground? The extreme polarity of it all was irritating.Despite these flaws, however, there was a chance this could develop into an interesting drama. I figured I was happy to overlook these obvious faults if the movie got some momentum. Alas, no, it just gets worse and worse. From a point the plot just becomes very random and, ultimately, pointless.Only worth watching if you're curious to know what all the fuss is about, but be prepared to be disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

What does it mean to be connected?  Or arranged?  Or programmed?  Or all of the above?,"Among the major artistic triumphs of cinema as a medium of the 21st century - and yes that is a hefty bunch of coconuts when it comes to praise - The Lobster is on the surface a dead-pan, ice-cold, horrific-as-the-Shining satire on marriage (notice the strings and shots of long hotel corridors), but is about so much more. It's a film that is devastating to watch in many moments, and it all comes down to how people are programmed; like the best dystopian fiction there is - Clockwork Orange, Kafka, 1984, Philip K Dick - it examines what it means when the heart and mind are ripped open and messed with to where they can conform to standards and rules. How can the heart have rules if it wants what it wants, so to speak? In Yorgos Lathimos' brutal, hysterical and harrowingly funny and sad look at what it means to fall in love, the rules are made to be broken and yet the hard-wiring is also essential.The film's themes are rich for examination, such as how it looks at marriage, this idea that we have someone we ""must"" be with (arranged of course, in a great manner of speaking as, if you don't in this world, you're turned into an animal, albeit of your choice with makes it rather existential in that very real sense), and also on the flip-side what it means to have solitude and be content with that (or not, as case may be). But a great film, a new favorite film, won't be one only on its themes, if it feels like homework to watch it. While The Lobster is not something that is made by a filmmaker who is out to conform to what everyone's idea of a typically shot narrative is (in this way he wants to stick to a rigorous form, maybe like Wes Anderson but also I got some RW Fassbinder in there as well, and Bresson in some of the acting but not all), it's a lot of fun to watch... well, in a manner of speaking.This is horrific stuff: Colin Farrell's character has to find a wife in 45 days and is sent to a hotel where all men and women are put into, for lack of a better term, uniforms (all the same suits and pants and dresses) and must find a mate. Also compatibility is all in this instance; while initially they may have found their first spouses on their own (this is a world so rich by the way in its construction you can feel the confines of it outside the hotel or, later on, in the woods), they're trained from birth that they MUST be with someone or ELSE. So when they are in this hotel they have to try and find, um, 'matching characteristics' such as a lisp (John C. Reilly, perfect from start to finish) or a limp (Ben Wishaw's John) or, for Farrell, near-sightedness. But this compatibility turns into a nightmare when a particular someone is matched up - they're moved from single to double beds - and the nightmare seems to be over once, as in many a dystopian story (i.e. Fahrenheit 451) when the hero escapes to join the so-called underground rebellion. Nope, not quite.What's so remarkable to me about this film is how it manages to show in its style and approach forms of distance and alienation (again Fassbinder comes to mind), but I was so emotionally engrossed in what was going on. The actors I think do so much to contribute with that, as people like Farrell, Rachel Weisz, even in her own subdued way Lea Seydoux (who becomes sort of the real, unexpected but most terrifying villain of the story in the conflict sense, at least to me), bring so much emotional weight to a movie that is all about what we hide and what we show. What you show can get you punished, or transformed (notice the odd but awesome placement of a flamingo in the woods at one point among some other animals), or killed or even worse turned into something that will change you while keeping you human, so the 'characteristics' aspect of a relationship - do you like this, do you know this - is all part of the point.It's a daring and provocative film that feels like a breath of fresh air, even as it's at many points unpleasant to watch. It's a strange thing to recommend a film like The Lobster so readily, in large part because it's a) like nothing else out there (a credit to my new favorite film studio, A24, also responsible for the horrific delights of The Witch and Green Room this year), and b) it's highly watchable. Again, this is, with all its slow-motion sequences (done at times to classical music) a chore to sit through. In a way its watchability is what may contribute to you squirming. I say good - sometimes you should squirm, whether it's a comedy or a horror or a cynical take on love or a tragedy. This is all of the above. Lanthimos may have his influences - some I may guess in my critical response, some I may have not gotten right - but he is all his own director, fully formed like some figure from Greece who's risen to the top of the ladder of artistry. I can't wait to see everything he does (aside from Dogtooth, which is amazing as well).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
6.5/10,"One of my most anticipated movies of 2015 based solely on the premise. I was fascinated by it as soon as I heard it and have been anxiously awaiting to see it develop since January. Now whilst a part of me is relived and enjoyed the film, I cannot help but be majorly disappointed by what this film ended up being and how far the final product end up from what it could have achieved.Maybe its part ingenuity since I am not familiar with Yorgos Lanthimos' work, that by the way after seeing this I look forward to check out, but this just seems to be a gold mine of ideas and developments that simply never expand and become the commentary, satire and dramatic storytelling they could have been.With also some perfect casting choices, especially in Farrell, Seydoux, Colemand and Weisz, whom are all really great and genuinely fun and interesting to watch on screen. They get what the material is about and are one of the main reasons the film never looses its pace. Thanks to their talent you are treated every once in a while to touching, funny and smart scenes that are a little too rare for this film. These are the moments that really get under your skin and make you think and laugh.There is, of course, a reason for why the rest of the films feels slightly off beat and not to the point: it is simply too unreadable. With such a premise you really have the occasion to make us as an audience relate to a million different situations and turn these situation on themselves and make us both laugh to death and emphasize with characters. But the dead pan of the people in this film and the situations taken into analysis simply don't leave space for the movie to explore what I wanted or to make it pose or answer the question it wants to ask or answer.There are some brilliant moments of dark comedy and uncomfortable storytelling that really ignited a flame in me when they came on, I was continuously asking myself: ""but why did they leave that there?"". I basically had a very frustrating time with this movie: on one side I truly admire is ambition, its premise, its ideas and part of the execution, but on the other I really had a hard time enjoying myself as much as I wanted because I wasn't given enough to imagine, think about or simply connect with.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Started out interestingly, but went nowhere very tediously","While the film was creative in it setting and filming, the strange dialogue, which helped set a tone, made the interpersonal relationships seem completely forced even when they should not have seemed that way.The worst part is that I watched it until it stopped. It is as if the film maker didn't have an ending to go to, and just go tired of the movie. Unfortunately, that took a long time. As a short, this film might have been remarkable. As a full length feature, it was just tedious and not entertaining.On the positive side, it had a great cast who probably did as much as they could with the material they were given. Yorgos Lanthimos wrote, directed and produced the movie and I'm unlikely to want to go see another movie by Yorgos. It was billed as a wickedly funny romance, but was none of those. I did laugh once.

Something is Wrong With Yorgos Lanthimos,"Full transparency: I hated Killing of a Sacred Deer and I have my reservations about even watching Poor Things because of its over-sexualized pseudo-feminism still beholden to a pretty disgustingly male gaze, despite its whimsical trappings. I just don't like this director.The Lobster has some incredibly beautiful scenery though, the atmosphere of the forest raised my interest considerably, and I accept it as symbolism of the freedom implied by refusing to conform to a rigid coupled existence. Beyond that it has its amusing moments, but nothing that was really laugh-out-loud funny. I found the deadpan delivery of the characters annoying after a while, not humorous, and Lanthimos' suggestion that people are coupled for stupid reasons like limps, nosebleeds and visual problems struck me as a testament to him possibly being on the autism spectrum and wildly misinterpreting why neurotypical people stay together - so that wasn't really funny or meaningfully symbolic either.The dog scene and the suicide attempt were both absolutely horrible and I didn't see an excuse for it, even as a horror fan.

TIFF 2015 -- The Lobster: Another take on relationships,"Yorgos Lanthimos gives us another taste of his monotone storytelling with 'The Lobster'. The story revolves around several nameless people who exist in a society that demands people to be in a relationship, or be transformed into the animal of their choice and be expelled into the wilderness to fend for themselves. Those who either become single through break-up or becoming widowed are sent to a hotel-like prison where they are cared for, but only for 45 days. If they fail to find a suitable mate, they are transformed and expelled.It doesn't take long to realize that you're not watching a Sci-Fi flick, but more so a satire on relationships and how people should always be a part of one, that single life is frowned upon. Colin Farrell's character attempts to jump through the hoops of the hotel by doing as they please, but his and other people's mentalities reveal that they cannot stay in that environment and would rather live amongst the Loners who vacate the forests, or die.We learn that mostly everyone who is a guest at the hotel is repulsive in some way: looks, attitude, or even a minor speech impediment. Eventually, it is understood that this brood of people -- losers, if you will -- are still supposed to be given a chance to find a mate and then live the rest of their dull life with that mate in order to avoid transformation.While the film exaggerates for our entertainment, it paints a very clear picture about how we perceive relationships and how we must be in one to complete our lives. Clearly, the attitude towards this idea is frowned upon (without going into Spoilers). The entire cast does a great job meeting the tonal demand of Lanthimos' films: dry, monotone, and almost no emotion. Farrell does a great job being terribly awkward. Rachel Weisz narrates the film, reading awkward lines in exchange for laughs. This film should be praised for its photography and script, but not for its length. Perhaps 20-30 minutes could have been shaved off to spare one from nodding off at times, just waiting for the end to come.'The Lobster' probably could have been a lot better had it been shorter. Despite its great script and hilarious pacing, the film eventually falls flat when it probably could have stayed on its feet.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Lobster: Grotesque for Singles,"Difficult for many to understand, but a touching and unusual movie. It tells about a world where lonely people cannot exist. The action takes place in a special hotel, where a man must find a couple in 45 days, or else he will be turned into an animal.The original narration and unconventional scenes for a big movie create an atmosphere of some surrealism, it is skillfully woven into the plot. This is a story of true love, a story about life, relationships and understanding, which is abstractly elevated to an absolute. A movie about how love can only be achieved through reciprocity and there is no room for coercion, cruelty, etc.I liked it. A good movie for the evening.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Painful,"I am obviously going against the trend here, so be it. I found the movie pretentious, ill balanced and with none of the nuances other more accomplished directors manage to reveal with their use of absurdism and counterpoint.First, if the movie had been short, maybe it would have been bearable, maybe, as it stands, its length goes to show, at least for me, that there was not a compass that guided the director, this was a rudderless attempt at social commentary. I don't care if Mr Lanthimos is considered the plus ultra of directors, this is bad.The movie tries to match absurdism with social commentary, but fails to create a world in which A) the absurd seems plausible and B) the plausible seems absurd. The deadpan, flat delivery of the lines loses all power after the first 30 minutes of the 1h 58m this thing goes on for and the humour, again, always spurred on by the absurdity of the moment/comment/observation, fails to find me (as it failed to find the funny bone of most people in a packed, large movie theatre in London, in fact, first movie I've gone to see in ages where people began to leave the cinema half-way, which I longingly followed with my eyes wishing it was me).The cinematography is fine, nothing out of the ordinary, but Lanthimos fails to use it to punctuate the absurd moments (something Wes Anderson does very well, as does Paolo Sorrentino) nor is the dramatism enhanced by precise camera work (Hitchcock, Fellini, Truffaut). The dialogue, even in its supposed absurdist nature, is poor, fails to weave across and is uneven. While the leads do a super job, the characters are flat and I don't care for them or what happens to them, which is always a bad sign for me.There are moments when this thing is good, like the hotel managers singing a duet, but they do not translate across the whole story, mainly because very quickly we leave the only part where there are interesting characters and spend the rest of the movie in the forest.I found the movie:-Too long -Pretentious without the grace to be so -flat -Uninspiring -did I say too long? -A convoluted way to tell a story that could have been told with the same intent in less time, with more observant, astute dialogue and far better crafted cinematography -A depressing experience -Not funny, by milesHaving just seen for the first time 'The Great Beauty' followed by 'The Royal Tenenbaums' I realized now what The 'Lobster' could have been but did not have the artistic currency to do. The social commentary is there, no doubt, I just did not like how it was executed.Maybe I am just a heathen with no taste...but of course, these are my impressions, I know others who truly loved it, and that is good too.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The delicious offbeat humour and high-concept weirdness of The Lobster's first act don't conceal the film's darker intentions. The threat of some sudden act of violence is never far away.Watch out for familiar faces such as Ben Wishaw, John C Reilly, Ashley Jensen and Olivia Colman in the excellent supporting cast.

The Lobster is a surreal and funny story about the stress of relationships. It's defiantly an acquired taste movie,"Our world has been changing a lot recently. Interracial relationships, orientation exploration, people questioning their gender, and revaluation of their faith has become more acceptable in a period where the internet and social media has opened doors that have been closed for so long. Places like Facebook and Instagram have let people know more about themselves, creating something of a revolution for those that are different. Though I still feel like that there is a benefit to privacy, this has given people more of an openness to new ideals, so I can give them credit for creating new social norms.One thing that still happens to raise eyebrows is when we find people that are not just single, but those that don't want to be in a romantic relationship. Society does place a lot of pressure for everyone to try to find a significant otherand to do it before it's too late. It's not just our media that's filled with constant relationship programs, but entire industries are built upon this with wedding, family, and even travel that supports the idea that no one should ever be alone. The Lobster is a surreal comedy that explores just how forced we are into relationshipsor not.Within the rules of an unnamed city, being single is forbidden. This is the case for a middle age man David (played by Colin Farrell) whose wife leaves him for another man. Now free, he is taken to a resort where all single people go. They are given forty-five days to find someone they like (they have to say which gender they want as bisexuality is forbidden as well) or they will be turned into an animal of their choice. As with the title of the movie, David decides that he'd like to be a lobster as he likes the ocean and he would be able to live for a long time.The hotel is filled with various dances and propaganda that fuels the importance of having a companion from the ban of masturbation to stage plays on why we need someone by our side. David talks to the other people that are also there, which include a Lisping Man (played by John C. Reilly), a Limping Man (played by Ben Whishaw) and a Nosebleed Woman (played by Jessica Barden). Outside of the hotel are a group of Loners, led by their leader (played by Léa Seydoux), who are hunted by the hotel guests in exchange for extra days to find a companion.I'll start by saying that The Lobster has a lot of creativity for creating this unique world that's clearly addressing the problems of our society (not just American, but worldwide) about the pressures of relationships. But without spoiling anything, the movie intelligently shows the other side's faults on why putting a label on something like love or solitude isn't a good thing.The joke of the movie is that everything is set is place, so most of the cast has a deadpan way of communicating, even during some of the more emotional moments. Some might see this as a problem, but independent filmmaker Yourgos Lanthimos uses it to his comedic advantage.Much of the ideas are surreal, especially with how they handle the idea of people remaining animals for the rest of their lives. The Lobster, like The Tree of Life and Eraserhead, is an acquired taste that not everyone is going to like. This movie may have a three act story, it's logic falls into the emotional category on how the film progresses. My only problem is the final scene, which tries for something ambiguous, but came off as incomplete. The Lobster is a movie that deals with getting answers, and I wish the ending had gone on longer.I'll give this eight lobsters out of ten. If someone were to tell me that this wasn't their cup of tea, I'd totally understand. This is a story that you simply have to allow to let loose to see what kind of emotion it can get from you. It makes you question just why society puts stress on relationships, so see if you can gain a proper insight.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's not for everyone, but it may be for you.","It's not for everyone. It's not quite for me, but I felt I had to put my two cents in about the film after seeing a NYT section today, on Valentine's Day, listing it as a movie discouraging love because I emphatically disagree with that statement.
First off, The Lobster is weird, and it's strangeness may be overwhelming and times in a way that can cloud what the true meaning of it is. It is depressing and quite pessimistic, yes, but this is done more to show the dangers of trying to define love rather than disparaging love itself.
The film's message, in my opinion, is that love can be indefineable; it's more of a feeling; a feeling that is indefinite, uncatagorical, and often times irrational.
The film simply is expressing the dangers of trying to categorize, organize, and rationalize love in an extremely over the top fashion.
Love should not be determined by good matches based on physical and definable traits, as is done in this story's dystopian world. It comes more from the minute details and underlying personalities between two people.
The film is not disparaging to love, but rather to people who don't understand a relationship from the outside looking in and discount it.
However it may seem, the idea that The Lobster hates love is wholly wrong. It is more a sad coutionary tale about trying to rationalize something that is undefinable and the lengths people will go to simply to freely feel in a society that requires proof of something unprovable from the outside. I am in love because I feel I am in love, and nothing more should need to be said.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Boredom with a dash of nausea,"Meh. The film starts with a delightfully surreal premise, and gets off to a promising start as a Strangelovesque dark comedy, or perhaps even a ""Being John Malkovich"" maze of mind-boggling left turns.The moments of humor, however, thin out. The plot hews to the obvious even in its twists. The deadpan delivery becomes merely dead, and a sea of intolerably flat affect gradually crushes any empathy we might have for the characters. Exhausted of its premise, disinterested in both the humans who inhabit it and the humans who are watching it, and groping for any sort of social observation that is not already obvious and well-trodden, the film finds it has little left to say and another 90 minutes to say it.It drags itself, sallow and lifeless, to a cliffhanger conclusion that leaves us wondering what happens next, but not really caring.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A real curate's egg.  Good in parts.,"Extraordinary but actually, whisper it, a bit dull.Having slept through fairly long tranches of this movie I'd nevertheless call it a success.In part.Colin Farrell is quite wonderful as the central character who is consigned to a form of detention in a hotel in the depths of Ireland after his partner dumps him. With his brother in tow (a Border Collie names Bob) he has 45 days to find a new partner or face being turned into an animal of his choice which is a lobster. Why? Because they live over 100 years and are fertile throughout their lives.On arriving he faces a gentle interrogation as to his sexual preferences in which there is a slight suggestion that he may in fact be homosexual but faced with making a decision he opts for straightness. It's an odd moment that isn't actually played out in any underlying way in the movie that follows.It's a dystopia in which no-one has any names and humans are not just transformed into animals but are also hunted in a nearby forest for hotel extensions.His quest for love is challenging and results in his escaping the, presumably government run, facility to join a band of guerrilla terrorists where he finds his match in Rachel Weisz. However the terrorists ban love so a complex sign language evolves between the pair as they seek to develop a relationship. It's kind of silly but also kind of funny. It's part farce, part surrealism and has several laugh out loud moments but it's too slow, dragging endlessly in parts. Yet the juries at Cannes nominated it for their top prize. I can see why, but I can also see why it failed to scoop.The director, Yorgos Lathimos, is renowned for his satires and this is his first English language excursion and has much in common with previous outings.This is Farrell's movie from start to finish as he is rarely off screen. He demonstrates his knack for off kilter humour that had us rolling in the aisles in In Brugges, but this a very different kettle of crustaceans.Nevertheless he pulls off his task with aplomb. It really is as quite remarkable performance ably supported by John C Reilly, Ashley Jenson and Olivia Coleman.Odd? Yes.Great? Not quite.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
so sad and so good,"So great on so many levels. The film is comedy, some laughing loud comedy, but that's just the outer shell. The story is very thrilling with a clear interesting plot, ups and downs with two or three explosive scenes. You could watch most of the scenes with no clue of what's happening just because of how beautiful the screen looks! Every scene is a work of art. I cannot point out enough how beautiful using the symbols is. A special performance by Colin Farrell and class-A acting from the rest.

Mmmmmmm Lobster,"The Lobster actually takes a pretty interesting idea about love and societies views of it and creates quite a dramatic piece about it. One can delve deeper into analysis of this film, but even at the surface this manages to be quite a journey and entertaining movie. Whilst it defiantly has its moments, the one minor flaw that I found was the prolonged sequences midway through the film. However, with that said, it's greatest moments are in the films writing. It's darkly comical, political and touching (in an oddly sick way).The Lobster provides quite a entertaining two hours for its viewers, giving them something quite provoking and, at points, quite heartfelt. Towards the end, and I really enjoyed this, was a somewhat reference to Dogtooth, and without spoiling it, it was what put the cherry on the cake.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Can rules and regulations ever be avoided?,"Set in an alternative reality in which unmarried individuals have 45 days to find a partner or be transformed into an animal, a jilted middle aged man flees to join some outlaws, only to find that they live by an equally rigid code. With such an offbeat premise, 'The Lobster' is always clearly a satire and the film cleverly mocks the way contemporary societies function. The unmarried individuals, for example, have to find a partner with a 'deficiency' in common (like the way dating services work), and they are subjected to spelled out lecturers in which the benefits of being in a relationship are driven home - to avoid rape, choking death when eating, etc. The film is incredibly funny at times too with Colin Farrell giving an excellent deadpan performance, pretending to be uncaring of a suicide at one point to seem as heartless as a prospective partner to-be. Rachel Weisz also has a superb turn late in the piece. With such an outlandish story though, the film unavoidably leaves open unanswered questions. Where does the child suddenly appear from? How can a society properly function where individuals cannot be separate from partners (what about those mall cops?). The film's take on the coupled society in which we live is sharp enough though for make any such issues a secondary concern. There does indeed something amiss with the way people tend to bounce almost immediately from relationship to another in the world in which we live, and certainly it is easy to imagine some of the rituals of our society seeming just as bizarre to the characters in the alternative reality of this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An unusual film that succeeded,"The Lobster has created the perfect environment for me to explore the precepts of humanity. We are exposed to fantastic characters as they move from one surreal activity to another. Like all of us, they are struggling with desires and behavior that falls outside of societies expectations/The stilted dialog magnifies the sense of remote dispassion. They often behave as observers and their ""separateness"" is extreme. Their isolation blurred the boundaries between themselves and the members of the audience. With the constraints loosened, there was a new freedom to observe and then reach conclusions. I found this much more satisfying that being force fed a story. I found myself being engaged in new and interesting ways while still being fully entertained!Without being too much of a spoiler, here is an example from one of the begging scenes. We see a woman stop, single out an animal and abruptly release her awful wrath upon it. We're never told who she is or why she might want to do this. Even so, it is easy to imagine the details behind her actions for yourself by the end of the film.As much as I like this film I feel some disclaimer is in order. This style probably isn't for everyone, I know some people just don't like the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Outstanding if you ask me.,"Such a unique film. The trailer makes this film seem like some sort of quirky comedy. However, watching the first 15 minutes will set the record straight: that that is far from the truth. This film is truly funny at times, but overall a dark study of human beings and relationships. Lanthimos strips human behaviour back to its core, without complex emotion. It's excellent. It leaves a lot unspoken and one is left to wonder about the context of the world we are thrown into, so it's perhaps not suited to the most mainstream of movie goers. But if you want something unique, unsettling and intriguing, this is your film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pretentious and toe curling,"The high praise for this movie on Rotten Tomatoes and also on IMDb made me make an account here. I have never disagreed more and quite frankly do not understand at all why the critics do not see how pretentious and awful this movie is. The actors are OK, but the film is a disaster. It starts out looking very art-house, with very slow story line and everybody looking artsy, but as it goes along the story becomes so utterly ridiculous and sickening without any purpose other than to be ridiculous and sickening that the movie really just turns into an empty shell, a pretentious 'how weird and shocking can we be' sort of thing. It wants to be art-house so bad it screams it at you. Overkill. The entire movie I wondered who had managed to convince the actors this was a good job to take on. Maybe I am looking at this from a European perspective? Maybe American cinema is lost in between Hollywood and a place they don't know where it is anymore. Art for art's sake can be good, but you can really fail if you overdo it. Maybe we can invent a new term for it: desperate cinema. Desperate to be special.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Left me cold,"Creative in immersing us in into this absurd, dystopian world, but lacking a payoff. It's too clumsy as an allegory for dating, too contrived/inexplicable as drama, too cheesy in its love story (that ending, oof), and not funny enough (or at all?) to be comedy. Could there be a collection of more awkward, robotic, and violent people? Anyway, points for originality and the beautiful cinematography, but this one left me kinda cold.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting movie that's not for everyone,"In a dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods.Now I'm sure you haven't heard that one before. I love these films which come up with these unconventional stories. The Lobster is a strange movie and the people in this future are all apathetic and uncharismatic which makes the fact that they have to form couples (probably for the survival of the human race) even more ironic. They bond on basis of common character traits (like .e.g a limp or short shortsightedness).This low budget production (4m$) has some big names like Rachel Weisz, Colin Farrel (who got a beer belly for the movie), Léa Seydoux, John C. Reilly and Ben Whishaw who all play their roles very minimalistic and subdued. The film is slow paced but still hypnotizing to look at, but I can imagine if these kind of movies are not your thing that you will find it quite boring.I found it an interesting movie which has some very dry humor in it (it's not a comedy mind you) and says something about the human condition and human relationships. I recommend it but that won't mean you'll like it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great premise, weak delivery","I think this movie has a great quirky premise - all the single people are sent to a hotel to find a partner in 45 days if they do not want to be transformed into an animal of their choosing. It is absurd, but at the same time a nice critique on the way we treat and over-emphasize relationships in our lives. The pace was great in the first part of the movie - we were led into the workings of this society through weird dialogs and situations in hotel. However, I felt like the second part of the movie was quite weak - a detached way of talking got tiresome, the plot became boring and at the end the movie made no point whatsover. Which is a shame, because it started out really strong.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting Premise but Disappointing result,"The Lobster features and interesting premise in itself as it is brilliant and loaded with comic situations, but where the movie goes wrong is in its cynical attitude towards the dating world. It tries hard to distinguishing itself and be creative and unique, only for the actual result of the film to be quite boring and doesn't seem to live up to its potential of ideas. Though one could argue there's a really wonderful love story buried somewhere beneath this cynicism, director Lanthimos' attitude towards society and relationships in particular is awfully bleak that it comes across cold and emotionally distant. The scenes at the hotel, while certainly better in their own twisted way, are an exaggerated response to the dangers of conformity. The Lobster feels longer than it's running time, and does not feel satisfied once the film ends. It isn't as funny as several critics claim, and although it is quite different, that does not necessarily make it good. Certainly this is a film for those of acquired taste.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Lanthimos' dystopia,"In a dystopian future where you're not allowed to be single, a man has to find a partner, or he'll be transformed into an animal.Yorgos Lanthimos' first film in english is hilarious as it is disturbing. The absurdity and execution of the story are the reasons for its seemingly contradictory qualities. It all feels synthetic. From the characters to the dialogues they have between them, the deadpan delivery of every line and the childish superficial reasons behind their choice of partner give the movie that uneasy yet comedic aura from beginning to end.I don't know if the movie has an intended message or not.

Deconstructing social pressure,"This is a fracking weird movie. It's all about how society pressures one to be in a certain way, thus depriving them of their humanity. The entire film is metaphorical: the dialog, the long shots in which people are small and meaningless, the way people talk without emotion, the narrator - at least in the beginning - which with a droning voice works against the character on screen, the structured dehumanization.I can't say I liked it, but it has an original idea and it is acted really well. A good cast as well. Reminded me of Dogville, a movie that I couldn't watch. Same approach of doing something different from what is expected with really known actors. It feels like a play.

"A must-watch movie about human relationships and society's ""boxes""","Yorgos Lanthimos comes once again with an original idea. I watched this after watching his masterpiece ""Poor Things"" and having watched the mediocre film ""The Favourite"". I believe that this movie is a must-watch.The story follows David in a dystopian world (or maybe an allegoric representation of our own world!) where people who are single have to live in a hotel until they find a match. If they don't succeed they will be turned into the animal of their choice. In order to find a match you have to share one characteristic with the other person such as easy nose bleeding or short-sight. One of the many rules in the hotel is the prohibition of masturbation and that there are no ""halfs"", meaning that there is no bisexuality, no half shoe size numbers and that's all because the Hotel wants to have everything in ""boxes"". Outside the Hotel there is a group called ""Loners"", whom Hotel residents should kill during every hunt. Loners have their own set of rules: no flirting and no relationship between two Loners!The world called ""The Hotel"" represents the conservative world we live in (especially in Greece), in which the society believes that having a partner is the most important task we have to accomplish as humans. The Hotel's belief system is not only conservative but also sexist as they think that a man is important for a woman to feel protected from other men who might attack her and men need a woman's company to have their life saved if they choke on food as it is shown during the Hotel's presentations. Furthermore, the Hotel transforms everyone into an animal (probably) so that they end up finding a partner after all for the same cause the Hotel believes we find partners as humans: Reproduction.The Loners have created a world that is the exact opposite of the Hotel one, making the movie's Manichaeism more obvious. This represents the people who want to oppose to everything that society necessitates. This opposition though isn't always expressed in a nice way. Léa Seydoux's character represents the aimless revolutioner who wants to express their opposition to the Hotel's dictatorship by creating her own kind of dictatorship. We cannot deny that this might not only a social comment but also a political one from Yorgos Lanthimos as modern day politics are seperated in two worlds: Republicans-Democrats, Labor-Conservative, Left-Right. Therefore, this dystopian world is not that far from our own world.P. S. I found both Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz's acting amazing. Lanthimos' directing and choice of music (there were some Greek songs in there as well :) ) were incredible! Great song to end a movie (Ti einai afto pou to lene agapi)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

If they don't, after a certain amount of time they will be physically transformed into an animal of their choice. Colin Farrell, the latest arrival, has chosen a lobster. This film is enjoyably odd. I especially loved the characters' robotic dialogue, which is sometimes just very funny. However, I had no real connection to it and, in the end, it didn't seem to me to be much else but weirdness for the sake of being weird. The characters and situation are so far removed from actual humanity, you'd have to work hard to find that it has anything particularly insightful to say about society, or even its more closely examined subjects like singlehood or relationships.

"Hilarious, gloomy and completely absurd","This is not a film for everyone. It's weird. It's often irrational. The central plot revolves around single people who must either find romantic partners or be turned into wild animals. Literally turned into animals. If that sounds too strange, this may not be the film for you. But if you're the type who enjoys movies that are a little different and don't necessarily need a Hollywood ending, ""The Lobster"" may deliver.We meet David (Colin Farrell) as he is being ousted from his home by his wife, who has fallen in love with another man. The rules of society dictate that because he is now single, he must be sent to The Hotel to find a new mate within 45 days. If he fails, he will undergo a procedure in which he is turned into the animal of his choosing. David has chosen to become a lobster, because ""lobsters live for over one hundred years, are blue-blooded like aristocrats, and stay fertile all their lives."" He settles in at The Hotel with the various other men and women who share his predicament. I don't want to get too much further into the plot details because, like most films, I think the less you know going in the better.Farrell plays the slightly insecure, puppy-eyed character he's become so good at, though this time he put on so much weight he's at first almost unrecognizable. The other main characters, including Rachel Weisz, John C. Reilly, Ben Whishaw and Ashley Jensen all give great, reserved performances, helped no doubt by the unusual writing and directing style of Yorgos Lanthimos, known best for 2009's Greek- language ""Dogtooth"". Together they've created a world that looks and feels exactly like our own, right up until the moment someone speaks.The film often feels surreal in the same way that Wes Anderson's films do, but whereas Anderson's movies can have almost slapstick over-the-top exaggerations, ""The Lobster"" succeeds by playing it completely straight. It's an entertaining black comedy, due in large part to the deadpan delivery of its characters. The one possible exception to this is Reilly, whose role as the Lisping Man seems to be channeling some of his exuberant, childlike Dale from ""Step Brothers"". While no one in this alternate world seems especially happy about the prospect of ceasing to be human, very few seem to be all that terrified by it, either. Least of all the Heartless Woman (Angeliki Papoulia), who produces one of the film's darkest scenes. What would be a brutal moment in any other film is made all the more jarring by its placement in what is otherwise just a very morbid comedy.""The Lobster"" may fly under many people's radars as it's not the typical rom-com fare, but it won three prizes at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival (and a nomination for the coveted Palme d'Or), along with an array of other film festival accolades. It does very much feel like a festival film, and as I said that may not be everyone's idea of a great movie. But if you've read this far, you'll likely want to give this one a watch.",,Anonymous,Romance

Perfectly completed masterpiece.,"This movie is an amazing story about pain, love and survival.It tells a story about a different society than ours and with characters that are clearly not acting in the way we are but through that it manages to mirror our reality in very clever ways.I could see many times in the movie how it critiques the way we handle relationship making today. The way apps or websites match you to people with the most similar interests without considering that we are more than that. It exposes the way we minimize who we are in order to be more easily classified and matched with others. It also critiques the way people act versus how they think in a couple situation and the way we are sometimes ready to completely change who we are in order to survive.To me it was an immensely satisfying movie to watch because I could see meaning behind every word and every action and could also connect on a very basic human level to the characters. Not everyone agrees with me and some say the movie was too long but to me this is a masterpiece and a very smart one at that and it deserved the whole 2 hours it runs.I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in human behavior and unique storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Rule-keepers are the Best Killers,"There are those who love rules. However, they mostly want others to live by them, not themselves. This is the premise of The Lobster where bizarre rules reign. Among them is a rule that if a spouse dies, then another spouse must be chosen - in a controlled environment and among slim pickings - within 40 days. Failure results in being turned into an animal of your choice. Of course there are exceptions. If you kill someone, you get an extra day. In such an Alice in Wonderland type atmosphere it is only the keepers of such insane rules who thrive.These rule-keepers rarely have a heart or any empathy for others. Rather, they are the best killers. Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz and John Reilly play characters that are caught up in this nightmare. I loved the theme of the story and the characters, yet I thought it was disjointed, awkward and too far-fetched even for me (a lover of such Kafkaesque settings). I may not have been in the right frame of mind going into the film or as convinced, as those at Cannes who gave it a jury prize, that the characters are motivated by fear. A very imaginative and interesting film overall despite the shortcomings. TSeen at the Toronto International Film Festival 2015.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A surreal, absurdist romantic comedy","What would you do in a world where you must have a partner, lest you be turned into an animal of your choosing?Colin Farrell plays David, whose marriage of 12 years (11 years and one month to be precise) has come to an end, where he finds himself in a lush hotel reserved for those who are single. Upon his introduction he is shown his room. His room number is 101 – a perfect sign for what is to come – and is told the laws of the land. If he does not find a partner within 45 days he will be turned into an animal and set loose into the woods. He is told that most people pick a dog, which is why the world is filled with so many dogs. Obvious, really. David's choice is a Lobster. I won't tell you why as it will ruin one of the many, many hilarious moments that the first half of this film is filled with. Among them is the 1984 references, which go further than his room number as he is woken every morning with a stern announcement of how many days he has left. The couples are also kept separate from the single people, as if a they are a class above them. David is able to make a couple of friends, a man with a lisp (John C. Reilly), and a man with a limp (Ben Whishaw) who had an ex-wife who also had a limp.The sold out crowd I saw this with was roaring with laughter, as even the narrator gets in on the act, with countless deadpan jokes that shouldn't be funny. But they are, and I found myself slapping my knees while crying from laughter. A lot of the humour stems from the singles trying to meet other people, the ticking time-bomb of their 45-day stay, and of course discussing among themselves which animals they would like to become. Nothing is sacred in this movie, it will make a joke of anything, including a suicide attempt. Needless to say, I counted at least four walk-outs. But hey, their loss! One person didn't walk out mid-film but I overheard her talking to her partner/husband. Her reaction was incredibly pessimistic and insulting, as in addition to hating the movie, she stated that anyone laughing at or enjoying the film, which was almost everyone, had their own problems with what they were laughing at.Her partner replied that he quite enjoyed it. I had to stifle my laughter to the point that snot was coming out my nose. The couple eyed me strangely and moved on.Another element of staying within this hotel is the Hunt. At regular intervals the singles invade the woods, the area in this alternate world where single people are banished after being transformed. It is also a kind of rebel base, where single people avoiding the hotel stay. Hence the hunt; armed with tranquiliser guns, each single person is required to try and bag themselves a single person to be taken back to the hotel. Days are added to their stay if their aim is true.To go on further would ruin the movie for any kind folk reading this, but this film is essentially separated into two halves. The first half is based in the hotel, while the second half moves to the woods. Deep down, under all the humour, is a love story that is not only touching, but, as well as the entire film, offers numerous comments on modern relationships. How we court others, the dedication one can have for another, the perceived need to share interests in common, I could go on. Having not been in a relationship in a fairly long time, I'm sure I took away a different perspective than anyone who has just had a relationship end, or someone in a relationship currently. The true genius of The Lobster is its ability to weave so many themes within the raucous comedy, which slows just a little in the second half of the film but is no less funny.This is director Yorgos Lanthimos' first film in English, and having never heard of him, I am very keen to see more. Not only was the camera-work unique but he also got the most out of his actors, Colin Farrell in particular is extremely restrained and barely shows any emotion for the entire movie, adding more humour to the situations he finds himself in.If I were to slap a label on this work I'd label it a surrealist, absurdist romantic comedy. This obviously is not for everybody, as its humour is very far from the crowd-pleasing, user-friendly jokes (I'm looking at you, The Martian) that so many Hollywood productions are filled with. The humour is arresting, it is in your face and it is not for everyone. However, if this sounds like your cup of tea, you'll be treated to an extremely unique view on modern relationships and the oddities that often arise, all while you are laughing at the extremely ludicrous jokes.www.epilepticmoondancer.net",,Anonymous,Romance

What a Bunch of Animals,"Yorgos Lanthimos disturbed the hell out of me with ""Dogtooth,"" his Academy-Award nominated film from 2010, and I still can't get that cinematic mind f**k out of my head. Now he returns with another provocation, and while certainly giving my wife and I something to chat about afterwards, doesn't make the same impact that he did with his previous film.""The Lobster"" is billed as a dark comedy, and certainly the premise sounds like a bit of absurd surrealism: single people are taken into custody and sent to a hotel where they must fall in love within a certain number of days or turn into the animal of their choice. There are all sorts of rules in place within the hotel as well as punishments for breaking them. Outside of the hotel, a group of resistance fighters have created their own little society of single people, and impose as strict punishments for those caught falling in love as the hotel does for those who remain single. The whole thing is presented as a nightmarish alternate reality to the one we live in; as in the world created in ""Dogtooth,"" everything is slightly off-kilter and out of step with the world as we know it, yet familiar enough to make us uncomfortable that it so closely resembles the one we live in.The biggest problem with ""The Lobster"" is the inconsistency of tone. I never knew from one scene to the next if Lanthimos was striving and failing at black comedy, or whether I was supposed to be taking everything at face value. There's a lot going on in the film thematically to make it resonate strongly with the troubled times in which we live -- themes of totalitarian government, intolerance of differing lifestyles, cultural obsessions with placing people into easily identifiable categories, the absurdity of trying to manufacture love in this age of ""The Bachelor"" -- but unfortunately the languid, monotonous rhythm of the movie undermines its examination of any of these topics. The actors, many of them usually very good -- like Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Lea Seydoux, and John C. Reilly -- are directed to walk through the film in a deadpan haze. This maybe was an attempt by Lanthimos to establish an ironic distance, but it has the effect of making all of the characters, and as a result what happens to them, difficult to care about.I like challenging, provocative cinema, but not when used to obfuscate rather than enhance.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Obviously polarising,"It's interesting to read the wildly differing reviews. There's no doubt it's a challenging film, but it's definitely worth watching, if only for the remarkable cast. It's a very absurd but oddly accurate reflection on how society views relationships. There are also some wonderful lines, such as : ""if you find yourself arguing a lot, then children will be assigned to you"" and ""There's blood and biscuits everywhere"".It left me thinking for a long time. I have a friend that had a series of failed, rapid relationships but when she started a relationship with a rugby player she complained that she'd have to learn about rugby. I remember pointing out to her that she always changed and attempted to fit into boyfriends ideas of their perfect woman, but she was adamant that this was the route to a perfect relationship. I also have family members that have had children in a vein attempt to save their marriage. I think it's a perfect film",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

An absurdist black comedy about society's obsessive mating rituals.,"To appreciate a film like The Lobster (2015) you need to know something about absurdism and dystopia. Whether we recognise it or not, our brains are wired into binary sets that help us make sense of the world. For example: in fictional narrative we tell stories about being unloved in order to express our need for love; we portray the fearful 'them' in order for 'us' to feel safe; and we explore the depths of 'evil' to celebrate what is 'good'. Absurdist films take these inversions of logic to their extreme in order to make us question the world we take for granted. They often add black comedy and dystopian/chaotic themes as a way of messing with our minds and challenging the foundations of our reality.If you are still reading this, you will recognise The Lobster as an absurdist dystopian essay. It is a story set in a place referred to as The City where coupledom is compulsory and being single is illegal. If anyone becomes un-coupled they are immediately incarcerated in The Hotel where they have 45 days to re-couple or they will be transformed into an animal of their choice. Most of the unnamed people we meet are referred to by a defining characteristic, except for our protagonist, recently widowed architect David (Colin Farrell). The inmates must participate in dancing to bland music and attend lectures about the evils of being single. They are only allowed to leave the hotel to join hunts in the forest. If they shoot escaped loners they earn extra time before being turned into an animal.In this rule-bound parallel universe everyone wears the same clothes and everything is hyper- regulated. When rules are broken punishment is severe: one victim has his fingers jammed into a burning toaster at breakfast for everyone to see. The forest world is the opposite to the The City. Escaped loners enjoy cool music and dance, but must stay single and any physical contact is forbidden. As his time runs out in The Hotel, David fears that he will fail to couple and flees to join the loners. As fate would have it, he meets his love amongst them and must sneak back into city life.What to make of this strange tale? Despite its all-star cast, conventional acting criteria seem irrelevant as performances are understated and almost expressionless. The filming palette in The Hotel is blandly desaturated while that for the forest is richly foreboding, making both feel unwelcome. There are no flashbacks or other cinematic devices that offer insight into why things are the way we see them. We are left then with the classic absurdist challenge: to find meaning in this film you must turn logic on its head.If you reflect on how much of our lives are focused on preparation for love and marriage, and how much real-world capitalist consumption is obsessed with beauty, sex appeal, and appearances, the absurd inverted metaphors of The Lobster begin to make sense. The City is not that different to romance TV reality shows where contestants hunt for mates based on defining characteristics. The real question is why are loners ostracised and why is there such pressure on finding partners? In the real world, I mean.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Strange, but pleasantly attractive","Set against a dystopian backdrop, the Lobster is the telling of a mix of bizarre ideas that one could only come to consider through this movie, and done so with much elegance that it keeps your attention throughout the span of its runtime.The world of The Lobster is eerily wooden, as is the range of expressions the actors were allowed to portray, constructing a universe that gets all the more weirder the more you think of it.The success of this movie is hooking you in with a sledgehammer of an opening act; with a world so strange, you find yourself wanting to know more about its intricacies and workings. Its drawback, however, is its world presented fully (almost exhausted) within the first half, that the remainder of the movie tends to feel draggy.Overall, however, the experiences from this movie are pleasant, and I would recommend it to someone wanting to watch something ""different"".",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The right to choose not to choose,"Yorgos Lanthimos delves deeper into his realm of weirdness to portrait in ""The lobster"" one of the most shocking, distressing and yet meaningful dystopian future the industry of cinema has thrown at us in decades. Does one really have the right to choose when he is denied the right to choose not to choose?No room for singles in this dystopian city out of Lanthimos' mind. No rights for them but a last chance to fix their malfunction, to set themselves right and find a partner. After all, there's no safe stroll without a partner, no dinner without risks without a partner, no being human without a partner. Its either marriage or a trip back to being an animal.But it is not just the oppressive atmosphere of the re-educating hotel Lanthimos crafts the best. It is the demonizing of both sides he delivers with utmost skill, showing no right choice but two opposite views stubbornly and cruelly carried through no matter the consequences. David must pick a side knowing both are wicked and wrong, and with all certainty that none will end well for him.Farrel delivers a great performance, topping an all around good performance from the whole cast.It is perhaps the subtle cruelty beneath all the glamour and glitter, the non-graphic violence delivered through oppressive peer pressure and witty dialogue that surprises the most and makes ""The lobster"" so enjoyable. Yorgos excels once again at his social criticism, but manages to wrap it in a well packed film that will unsettle most but disturb none.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Weird and unpleasant,"Wow, people love this movie. My girlfriend, a fan of dystopian fiction, had been told she would like this, and was actually very excited about it. I found the premise offputting and thought it would be inherently depressing. So we went into the movie with different expectations, but by the halfway point, we both agreed it wasn't worth continuing.This is a very odd movie. People speak in awkward sentences as though the dialogue was written by someone who specializes in English as a second language instructional audio tapes. The basic premise (single people must quickly become coupled or they will be turned into animals) is never explained, meaning it's not really dystopian fiction but just absurdist drama, and as that it's not that interesting.It's a very unpleasant movie. People do awful things, but no one is horrified; the movie is, perhaps, about how numb people are to the tragedies of the world, but for me, it was just a weird mix of disturbing, detached, and dull.From what I've read, some people find this movie really funny. I found almost nothing about it funny. Or interesting.After we gave up, we did check out the synopsis on wikipedia to find out how it all turned out. That convinced us we'd made the right decision.If you like dark, arty, abstract, emotionally distant satire, you might like this.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A very good idea, but somewhat poorly executed","An absurdist comedy that brushes into the weirdness of social pressure regarding relationships (and being single). The movie has it's moments, mixing disturbing moments with dark humour, using clear and not-so-clear allegories to illustrate basic human needs such as love, sex and acceptance, and how we reinvent ourselves in order to try to find a partner. Also, it offers funny and disturbing insights on the great pressure society makes in this area. However, the excess of the absurd in the human relations tend to make them over simplistic and not human at all. Therefore, there are several ocasions where the movie could have better explored the complexities and subtleties of the theme within relationships, but didn't, for being over simplistic. At the end of the movie you get the sensation It didn't really get anywhere that made some sense, and that the basic idea of the script could have been much better executed",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant,"Quite easily the greatest movie I've ever seen. It's as if someone took the surrealism of Rubber and added real depth to it. The movie's one and only flaw is the length, but other than that, it's flawless. The acting was robotic and dull, but with the intention of being so as it parallels the animalistic nature of love within society. The movie creates a drastically hyperbolic representation of society's push for us to find love, even if it isn't meaningful. Then it later shows us the push by the other side of society to avoid love in any form. Both sides harshly punish those who fail to meet their standards, and in the middle, we have our protagonist. A man who, in between worlds of fake love and forbidden love, finds real, true love. The City's policy of turning people into animals should they fail to find love, the robotic nature of the people and their tendencies to spew out information at others, and the surface level romance where people are attracted to one another based on things such as physical disabilities they may share are perfect example of how this society treats its people as animals who exist merely to breed. In all of this, however, our main character suffers and struggles through the loss of love and the finding of it. A masterpiece of cinema that is sorely underrated. In a mass of Michael Bay-esque movies with no story or character development in exchange for gross amounts of CGI and explosions, a rose like this with meaning and beauty to it is a gift to the dying culture of today's world. Watch this movie, I promise it will be worth it",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty Good Movie,"Rating: 7.7
Overall, a pretty good film that is a unique take on social anxiety and loneliness with its script and performances, but feels like it drags with its long exposition and deadpan style.Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale feels similar to his other movies (but in a pretty toned down way); the direction on a microscale is good because he helps establish the tone and the sense of anxiety with the deadpan and pauses in dialogue; the direction of actors is good because everyone's deadpan acting helped establish their character's social anxiety; the storytelling is pretty standard to both narrated movies and Lanthimos' style; he builds tension decently well as a lot of the moments of silence do bring out some anxiety for both the characters and the audience), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Colin Farrell (Embodies someone with social anxiety and loneliness very well as his deadpan demeanor coupled with his intentional pauses help portray his character), Good from Rachel Weisz (A very experienced actor who has good chemistry with Farrell, while simultaneously shining in her own moments), Pretty Good from Jessica Barden (Her deadpan style helps portray her social anxiety and loneliness well), Pretty Good to Good from Olivia Colman (Shines in her scenes as she establishes a sense of status being the manager of the hotel (something that will be a major key in her next collaboration with Lanthimos)), Pretty Good from Ariane Labed, Pretty Good from Angeliki Papoulia (Helps establish a sense of a pseudo-antagonist with her relationship with Farrell), Pretty Good to Good from John C. Reilly (Shows a good amount of emotion and a sense of desperation in trying to find a partner), Pretty Good from Léa Seydoux (Her monotonous tone helps show how numb she was to loneliness as she was trying to lead her people), Pretty Good to Good from Ben Whishaw (Embodies someone with social anxiety, loss, and loneliness with his lack of emotion and awkward social connection), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone did their job in portraying people with social anxiety and loneliness as there is a lack of connection throughout the cast, leading this to be one of the better portrayals of social anxiety and loneliness)), Pretty Good Story (The concept is a very unique take on social anxiety and loneliness; the plot structure is kinda an issue as the movie focuses way too much on its exposition that it makes the rising action/the second half feel like it is dragging; the runtime could have been cut by like 20 minutes as the movie spends too long at the hotel; flow between sequences is intentionally rigid as it helps portray this disconnect the characters had with each other; character writing is good as it is a pretty accurate portrayal of social anxiety and loneliness, and how far people will go to ease their pain (especially with the main character)), Very Good Screenplay (The dialogue is pretty witty and well written as it helps portray the conflicts people are facing; the humor is very deadpan, and written well as it presented a lot of unintentional shocks and laughs; the symbolism is very prominent throughout the movie as the whole movie can be thought of as a symbol for social anxiety, loneliness, and the quest to ease this pain; the foreshadowing is good as it helps lay roots that will impact the character's actions towards the end), Good Cinematography (A bit more toned down than Lanthimos' other movies, but still pretty European and auter-esque), Pretty Good Sound, Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Helps portray the animals), Good Production Design (Helps portray the hotel and the forest), Pacing is incredibly slow as its deadpan style makes the audience feel uncomfortable the more the movie goes on, Climax is decent as it presents critical choices for the characters to make, Tone was a deadpan take by Lanthimos, This movie feels like if Napoleon Dynamite was made by an auter.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A brilliant movie that needed...something,"The concept here is pretty brilliant: a dystopian reality that legislates coupledom. From single people becoming animals to characters being defined by their limitations, this film points out the absurdities of our society's obsession with romance. In fact, it borrows heavily from the theater of the ""absurd."" And that's both genius and problematic.

Yorgos Lanthimos is a brilliant Greec director and writer. He has very outstanding style which you can recognize. If you liked The Lobster I would highly recommend to watch ""Alps"" and ""Dogtooth"".The cast in The Lobster is made of wonderful actors: Farrell (who in my opinion just gets better and better) , Weisz, Léa Seydoux, Whishaw, Reilley. They create this extremely strange world, where being single is like a plague or AIDS.. On the outside it shows the struggle ofsingle people in the outside world, but deeper it simply reveals main issue: how judgmental the society is.All I wanted to say was that this is one of those films which is not for general audience.

"A Very Odd, Yet Captivating Film","I have known about this movie for quite some time now, but I have always found different reasons to neglect to watch it until now. I always thought that the film looked really weird, which ultimately steered me away from watching it. I finally decided to give it watch, and even though it ended up being far weirder and much darker than I originally expected it to be, I was not pleasantly surprised. The dark humor and extremely cringe-inducing interactions between the characters was incredibly amusing, and was something that you do not see very often in cinema. I also really liked the unique plot of the film, even though it could be confusing at times. The entire cast was great as well, and they all added a lot to the film in their own ways. There were only a few problems that I really had with the film. One being that it was a little long, and really dragged on at times. I think that a few scenes could have been removed to prevent that from happening. The only other issue that I had was the ending. It felt a little bit rushed, and then it ends with a bit of a cliffhanger, which I was not a particularly big fan of. All in all though, it is definitely a film that I would recommend to you if you like original ideas, great acting, and clever dark humor.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Broad satire of relationships. Maybe too broad.,"When I saw ""Dogtooth"" I assumed that the actors' flat, affectless delivery of lines stemmed from the particular circumstances they were in. Now I see that this is more or less Lanthimos's jam.Lanthimos satirizes romantic relationships, and the societal pressures around them in the same way he dealt with familial relationships in Dogtooth - by making the rules strange, arbitrary, and difficult to break without running afoul of someone or something in power.Here, single people have just 45 days to find a partner, or they'll be turned into an animal of their choosing. This leads to people rushing into relationships based on commonalities, however trivial, rather than bonding in a true and natural way.However, when David escapes and discovers a group of loners, it turns out that the loners are just as bad. No romantic activity of any kind is allowed. Not even flirting, and this rule is enforced in horrifying ways.What I see here is, on the one hand, fear of lonliness, and on the other, repression of intimacy.So when David and the Short Sighted Woman fall in love naturally, it offends the loner leader, so she has the Short Sighted Woman blinded. Now they have ""nothing"" in common anymore. This leads David to a decision to blind himself, just so they can have this characteristic in common.Anybody who's been around the dating block a few times knows these feelings. The fear of loneliness and the perceived pressure to find a mate. The ""helpful"" friends who want to set you up, etc, and conversely, the reluctance to get too intimate too quickly.While I enjoyed the film, and its satire resonated with me, I do understand why so many people dislike this film. It's very slow. The satire is exaggerated to the point that makes you think, ""is it really that bad?"" and decide that it's not. After seeing this and Dogtooth, I do wonder what Lanthimos's personal relationships are like.I would like to see more of his films to decide if he's got a full, coherent worldview here, or just a few tricks to create an atmosphere of awkwardness and alienation.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The malaise is also consequence of our reflection about our relations, sometimes so ""grey"" and empty. What's the better thing to do?

This why we only listen to electro music.,"I love this quote machine of a masterpiece. This is very Kafkaesque, and done just right as a satire, instead of pictures such as ""Deep dark"", which are very commendable, brave and fun, but tend to escalate into pure flimsiness and really rub it in your face how ""edgy"" they are. No, the photography, directing and acting in this flick will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. I myself see myself as an easily distracted guy, I must admit I tend to get a little bored by drama, but the subtle tone of this film, the comedy and absurdity of the human condition had my eyes peeled throughout the film. I dare already say one of the best films of this year. What I myself being a writer find most noteworthy in the interaction and dialogue is how the pressure of society get really obvious when they flip the script like they have done here; Our modern world WORKS JUST THE SAME, but instead of how things are in our modern real life society, the characters here do their very best to parade their perfect treats and are all painfully honest about their disadvantages, but also invent new ways to lie, when the stake is that society will turn them into beasts and leave them in the woods if they can not mate. Because, as they say ""two is obviously better than one, this is a reminder"". Every characters antics and actions makes perfect sense in this fully logical context, where even just standing alone by yourself in a shopping mall will not only be frowned upon -it will have dire consequences. A brilliant portrait, analysis and analogy of what loneliness is. Let this remind you of death. It won't get more fun and stylish than this.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Take away the weirdness or absurdity and there's not a lot going for it,"Yorgos Lanthimos' 'The Lobster' is a weird film.In this world, citizens have to go to hotels and find partners within a set amount of time. If they fail to achieve this, they will be transformed into an animal of their choice. This is Davids story in this situation.This film is about forced love, blind love, love at first sight, and taking the concept of tinder to an absolute extreme. Of course, a lot of this isn't obvious throughout the film and is later implied but the point and meaning still stands.Though this film wants to have meaning, it doesn't take away the fact that it is a very weird film and other than the absurdity and weirdness, it doesn't have a lot going for it.I haven't seen any other Lanthimos projects but I can tell that this is not his best work. The aspect of this film that he took part in this could have been done by anyone who was aiming to making this film what it was and Lanthimos doesn't add anything too special to the film.The screenplay is where this movie shines, what actually gave this film it's weird feeling couldn't have been done without the weird actions that played throughout the screenplay or because of the screenplay.The cinematography is quite dull but maybe that was on purpose as it does seem like a dull life for this world and for David.Though I would watch this film again, it is very unique and definitely has its own standing out aspects which other films fail to achieve.

I was picking up what it was putting down,"I remember when this film came out back in 2015, thinking that it looked super art-house and probably wouldn't be my kind of thing. What a fool I was.

That was this film for me. Usually a lot of metaphors, subtext and symbolism in films go over my head, but in this case I was picking up what they were putting down. I also watched a few explanation videos afterwards that pointed out a few things I had missed. This is one of the smartest films I've seen in a long time.A film like this has no business being as entertaining as it was though. Firstly, it's hilarious. I found myself laughing more than I often would in a pure out and out and out comedy. Secondly, you never know what is going to happen next. Nothing is off limits and the story is so bizarre and unpredictable than anything can be around the next corner.This is the kind of film you just don't want to end.

The Lobster is a disjointed film that runs too long and doesn't know how and when to end.,"The Lobster left me CrabbyIf you had to be turned into an animal, what would it be?That is the set up for the film, ""The Lobster."" People go to 'The Hotel' from 'The City' because of a tragic romantic loss and are forced to choose the animal they will become if they don't find a life partner in forty-five days. It is unclear whether people are forced to go there or they choose to go because of their emotional loss. One bit of dialogue could have solved this problem, such as, ""I had to come here because my wife left me; Why are you here?"" would have solved this conundrum. That is just one of several parts of the story that are unclear. A film that is not completely explained is one thing; a film that is inexplicable is a let down. Like the Lynch film ""Inland Empire"", ""The Lobster"" ends too soon but goes too long and is more confusing than mysterious.The Hotel is a combination of the worst dating scenes know to humanity. Some people are there seeking a relationship, others are happily hooked up while others try to mess up those romantic bonds using rumor, lies, unfortunate truths and the maiming of others.Some critics say this film is in a dystopian future. It seems more like a parallel present, with the film being an allegory for relationships and how we treat each other. It is an incredibly interesting story until near the end. The setting changes, a new plot point emerges and while interesting, the end doesn't honor the quality of the rest of the film. An interesting ending might have saved the film and made it fabulous, but it got lazy. It seems the director and writer didn't know how to end it, so they left it hanging. I don't need everything resolved, but setting us up and not resolving anything is bad film making.Imagine 'The Usual Suspects' ending with the scene of Verbal Kint sitting in a chair in Detective Kujan's office, then a fade to black. Imagine 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' ending on a shot of the three gun men facing off in the graveyard, then fade to black. Nope, the directors and writers of those films knew they needed and ending, wrote one, filmed it, and then distributed it. 'The Lobster' fails to end and runs too long. It is a major disappointment, for it had such a great beginning and middle sections. Not even the good acting, great cinematography and good editing could save the film from dying.The critics love this vagueness, as if being confusing was artsy, just like critics once called a blank canvas fine art. It's all up to interpretation, you see, so go forth and interpret. Well, then why make a film at all? At Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 90% rating by the critics. I wonder if half of them fell asleep near the ending or went to the bathroom and missed the vast emptiness of its mindless conclusion? That must be it. Who else can explain such ratings?Rating: Rent it. I have written myself into it giving it a low rating. It disappoints so completely at the end that it doesn't deserve more.Peace, Tex Shelters",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Yet another author's bitter view of the human flaws,"I'm not too familiar with Yorgos Lanthimos' works, and so far i've only seen his Oscar-nominated Kynodontas. But it looks like the author is on the mission of exposing the defects of the modern society in a not-so-cryptic but still an allegorical way. And while i believe that his view of the parental overprotection/abuse of their children was way too exaggerated and dramatic, his view of the awkwardness of today's relationships between people is much more curious and realistic.Freddie Mercury, when he was once asked what Bohemian Rhapsody was about, gave a simple answer: ""It's about human relationships"". The same description probably fits this film if one was after a simple answer. A more detailed description would be inherently subjective, for a film that speaks riddles and metaphors to you is never what it shows but rather what you see, and different people can see different things. What i saw was a rather sad contemplation of how we humans interact with each other, of the pressure the society puts on us when it tries to categorize us or impose its views of normal on us, of the fact that no matter how you run or hide, there alway will be someone who thinks that they know better and that you're obliged to follow their opinion on what's right and wrong.In the modern Western world, where a CEO of a huge corporation can openly admit being homosexual and have no problem with it, such visions could be considered too dire to be relevant. So maybe the works of Lanthimos are a reflection of his personal tragedies or his experience of living in Greece. But there is still a reason to view The Lobster as a warning (or even a revelation) that we all should pay attention to.You see, the best way to expose something crooked or perverse is to simply demonstrate it in action. The Lobster does that by showing the societal pressure and personal defenseless as a norm, to provoke a response in us and make us think something like ""Why the hell aren't you doing anything? Stand up and fight for yourself!"". And it's a powerful tool, for it's often the case that only by feeling discomfort about someone else's compliance and passiveness we finally realize how much we avoid fighting for our own selves.But the scariest thing about The Lobster is that not everything that it shows is that utterly uncommon. But this time it's not the society and its latent dictatorship, but the people themselves. Even alone with their close ones, even when nobody's watching and there are no rules to play by, they still can't relax and be genuinely interested in and kind to one another. And that's not just fiction, it's what i personally see in more and more people these days: social awkwardness and sociopathy, lack of empathy and ability to read the emotions of others, a general coldness and discomfort from another person's presence. Like the parties where people bury themselves in their smartphones instead of actually talking to someone or the families where the partners hardly even speak, each in their own cyberreality. The way such people talk when forced out of their virtual covers, that helpless look of a fish taken out of the water - that's eerily similar to how The Lobster's characters behave sometimes, which creates a sinister picture of what our world of tomorrow might become. And if some of us do manage to see themselves in that distorting mirror then maybe transforming into creatures that live long and mate happily but are otherwise cold and indifferent is a fate humanity might still avoid.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hypertrophied melodrama unlike any other,"This is one of the first movies that was unlike anything else. I'll be honest, when I watched this movie for the first time, I didn't understand what the hell was going on here at all. I was confused by many things at the time: the direction, the camerawork, the plot, one single joke and the incomprehensibility. But even then I marked to myself that I didn't understand the movie and it was worth re-watching. And now, about 5 years later, I started to understand the movie.The main feature of the movie is its unusual, non-standard presentation of the plot and idea, applying techniques that mock the format of melodrama. Also, worth mentioning that the movie also mocks sociality as such. It's made cinematically enough, but it doesn't look like it. Everything is done on purpose to emphasize the director's intent, which came out awesome.As for the negatives, it's partly the director's intention itself which is complicated. You don't get the feeling that this is a great movie. Unique - yes, understandable and easy to follow for the first time - no.The movie may seem boring, incomprehensible, fairy tale of some kind. But if you don't concentrate on that, and note different things that the director wanted to say, then this movie deserves a special mention.

"Strange, Bizarre, Peculiar","Greetings again from the darkness. The scene playing over the opening credits is baffling to us and sets the tone of peculiarity that runs throughout the film. A lady gets out of her car during a rainstorm to perform an unthinkable act as we watch through the windshield as the wipers rhythmically clear our view. Next we watch as Colin Farrell's wife announces, after 11 years of marriage, she is leaving him for another man. Curiously, Farrell asks if her new man wears glasses or contacts.Welcome to a dystopian future via the warped and creative mind of writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos (Dogtooth, 2009). It really boils down to a satirical look at relationships and our societal outcast of single adults. In Lanthimos' world, Farrell, now a single man, must check in to the oddest country hotel you've seen. He has 45 days to find a romantic partner. If he doesn't, he will be transformed into the animal of his choice. He chooses the lobster because of its long life span  ignoring the probability of ending up on a restaurant platter.It's an oddball world overly structured with rules enforced by the Hotel manager – a terrific Olivia Colman. Farrell befriends a couple of other single fellows: the limping man (Ben Whishaw), and the man with a lisp (John C Reilly). It's funny and uncomfortable and kind of sad to watch these folks awkwardly try to connect with others with a deadline fast-approaching.The first half of the movie is really black comedy at its finest, but once Farrell escapes the Hotel and joins the ""loners"" in the forest, the tone shifts a bit. An uneven romance develops between Farrell and a woman played by Rachel Weisz (who is also the film's narrator). Even though this group of loners pride themselves on independence, it's ironic that Farrell has merely traded one set of rules for another  courtesy of the rebel leader played by Lea Seydoux.It's a bizarre film, and one from which we can't look away. The deadpan-yet- emotional dialogue delivery is strange enough, but the site gags are even further off the charts – keep an eye out for animals (former singles) strolling by in the background (peacock, camel, etc). There is certainly insight into modern day relationships and how people connect based on instantaneous judgments  but at least we don't have to dig our own graves  yet!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Filmed in Ireland, but probably meant to represent Europe in its current hot mess, this enjoyable magical-realist romance satirically and figuratively features the complex challenges facing anyone dating in the modern age and anyone hoping to assert a unique personality in a time that homogenizes rather than individualizes.David is attending a spa specializing in his finding a suitable mate or turning him into the animal of his choice if he doesn't find a mate in 45 days. David chooses the lobster also because, besides the admirable life expectancy and fertility, it has the reputation for fidelity, albeit serially monogamistic.The fascinating narrative is filled with juicy eccentrics identified by their ""defining trait"" (e.g., ""Lisping Man""—played by John C. Reilly), a nod to the online shortcuts of match making in a harrowing search for love that too often ends up in the figurative animal kingdom. Writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos can satirize boilerplate screen writing manuals at the same time.The strict adherence to a couples-only society may appeal to extreme social conservatives today, but it is fraught with frustration for the average sophisticated citizen.David's discovery of the ""Short-Sighted Woman"" (Rachel Weisz) offers hope in a world where ""loners"" are hunted in the forest and tranquilized. Falling in love, the two go through various plans eventually to liberate them from the strictures of both the hotel and the free-spirited loners in the forest.Unfortunately, a very Greek tragedy-like outcome affects their eye sights possibly to emphasize the blind nature of love and its violent possibilities. Fortunately, Farrell and Weisz deadpan through the vicissitudes of rebellious love, allowing us to concentrate on how desensitizing the forced decorum of contemporary romance can become.""If you encounter any problems you cannot resolve yourselves, you will be assigned children, that usually helps.""

If you see artistic value in Picasso...,"then you probably have enough open mindedness to realize this film is a work of art. It's not for everybody (especially if you have a hard time watching that commercial that tries to get you to save all the abandoned, abused dogs in the world) but it keeps you entertained, locked in, and has you trying to calculate understanding throughout. The aura you feel is reminiscent of The Royal Tenenbaums. Colin Farrell fits in perfectly and as with all the characters, you are dying for someone to show traditional emotion. When you finally get a taste, you realize traditional is so damaging to their society that it blows your mind. If you don't get Picasso, when film credits start rolling you will say the same thing you said to yourself at the end of DJ Snake's Turn Down for What video: ""What the F did I just watch?!?""",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Definitely an acquired taste,"The lobster is a movie that's not for everyone. Some will adore it ,some will despise it. Now as whole , I believe that it requires some practice to enjoy this film. Now I understand that sounds bizarre, but it worked for myself. If you'd like to enjoy this film, you have to have exposure to similar style movies. I would reccomend you watch the killing of a sacred deer, as it will prepare you for the awkward and sometimes unnerving dialogue- as well as spontaneous moments of horror. This type of exposure to similar films, will make the lobster much more enjoyable. I believe this because it worked for this one, I enjoyed the plot alot more and found the acting not annoying or disruptive, but intriguing. The social dilemma presented in the lobster has a big impact on the viewer because it turns something pretty generic (being single) into a twisted and macabre social experiment. If your interested in dystopian dilemmas, this will work for you. But again this needs exposure.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Essence of Absurdism According to Camus,"Yorgos Lanthimos presents the audience with a dystopian society, unlike something such as George Orwell's 1984, or Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, it is simply hilarious. It presents a world riddled with absurdity, Camusian absurdism, it allows the audience to realize the value in uncertainty, presenting a radical and meaningless society, analogous to that of our own. As Camus does in The Myth of Sisyphus, The Lobster poses the statement that life is meaningless, men's desperate longing for the rational, for meaning and purpose, only leads to desperation and irrational behaviors, that is itself absurdism. This is manifested through the pointless rules of love presented in The Lobster's society. The film looks at weather or not one should commit suicide, the futile attempt at happiness, the importance of freedom and uncertainty. The pure awkwardness of the film, the robotic dialogue, the repetitiveness, it is all a means to show us, the viewer, that life is absurd, and while we are at it, just laugh at that fact, what else can we do, but be happy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is not a love song,"This is sci-fi only in the sense that Brazil was, a way of baring the social wiring under the floorboards with more bluntness than we would accept in real life; allegory, usually a dreary thing. The comedy comes from absurd leaps and reductions in world and feelings.But it's a treatise that we really get; the mechanization of contact and love, an obsession with courtship, implying an intolerance or fear of being alone. A man who as soon as his wife leaves him is immediately taken to a secluded hotel where single people have to find a partner in 40 days, such are the rules of the city.Yes, we see people in such circumstances as these reduced to a childlike meekness, wooden displays of human beings. Yes, we see how the process stifles and gives rise to neglect and callousness. A loss of genuine feeling replaced by compulsions and all of this as something we're meant to recognize around us.Out in the woods exists a society of outcasts, single people who have escaped confines. But we're not shown any antidote among them; rules that forbid romance are as strident and absurd here, another dystopia of thankless freedom. All told we're shown a world bled of truth and a hodge podge of behaviors in its place. Although the world is ordered by rituals, we get to feel the slow collapse of persons, the perversion of truths.It's the method used to achieve this disarray that I find the most interesting here and seems novel enough. Some filmmakers stage and have the actors convey, beauty or anguish. Others channel through the eye. This one engineers behaviors, tinkering to create tentativeness as the shape of emotions. The actors don't convey, are not supposed to have real access to their person; we note the fumbling as innocent discovery of real emotions.But now having mentioned all this, questions. There's something resembling love eventually pursued, but is it even close? Do we have use for films that make as if we're hapless victims of a society that prevents us? The film strips down to where the concrete and wirings show but does it put any of it together as a place in which to live? Surely, we're not a mass of foibles. Surely, there are paths that lead out of our neuroses, we spend our lives finding these out.I guess this will do just fine for viewers who can find some measure of glee in the gloom. It seems like a tentative step at this point but Lanthimos is setting out to carve, which is half the battle. It will be interesting to know with hindsight what this one was prefiguring. Was he fumbling in the discovery of real emotions, a necessary middle step? Or will he turn out to be someone who film after film controls and reduces just like the villains here?",,Anonymous,Romance
With Lanthimos's signature,"With the unmistakable weird and disconfortable atmosphere signature by Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, and also a great casting, this innovative film stands between several genres and issue that hardly would be together in a ""normal"" movie: the movie is, all at once, a dark comedy, a sci-fi dystopia, a pair of brutal code systems of duties and punishments, a romantic drama, a comedy of manners mocking on shallow criteria for couple match, a surrealist allegory, a clash between rival merciless and authoritarian factions.

Is love a real possibility?,"A very disturbing film yet very thought-provoking. Lanthimos has built this movie around society's expectations of human relationships.

Just as the movie starts to investigate a third option, that of true love, the film ends abruptly letting the viewer decide which way the story goes.

Existential Angst,"The Lobster is a wonderful, deep-dive into the existential angst our societies often cultivate around the perceived abnormality of people who aren't in a relationship. It deftly explores the various concepts of love in the Greek language, which tend to be compressed into romantic love in the English language.The nightmarish world in the film, of people trying to do anything, including lie to each other, in order to be part of a couple, isn't so far removed from the imperative our society places on people hooking up to reach 'fulfilment' in life. Disaster arises when we rush into couplings for the wrong reason, with a partner who is often also swimming in an ocean of the unexplored self.

He has a constant sadness and feels like an outsider in every scenario. It takes a while for Rachel Weisz to actually appear so the decision for her to have a narration beforehand really works. Her voice is a perfect fit and her deadpan delivery makes it even better.Yorgos Lanthimos' direction crafts a very desaturated world which is ideal for a world in which no one's normal and everything feels emotionally cold. Early on, there are some flourishes of slow motion which are a wonderful exercise in style with substance to back it up as they still communicate a lot about the characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

If you want to cut this experience short...,"... take a hammer, place a nail on your thumb, and then hammer away, while talking about how this is totally like your life, and how hard and painful it is. Now you got the general idea of the metaphores used here, so let's do one of the amazing deep twists right through the 4th wall - how it was you who was driving the nail deeper and how you could have just stopped because you knew from the very start that this was a really bad idea. And that pretty much sums up the film AND your feelings while watching this film, now those are some layers and depth right there!If you manage to film it, you'll have a masterpiece just like this one on your hands, and you can talk about how one has to suffer for art as a little bonus for the crowd that tends to be impressed by this type of thing (they also tend to buy every new winter collection from the emperor's new clothes brand).To be fair, technically I loved this movie, and how absolutely comitted it was. I admire the cast, and even though I had no love for the result, it was a masterclass in direction. But if you are looking for entertainment or something to learn or think about, I'd not recommend this.This is more the kind of film that you can use to talk someone into thinking how extremly individual and special and intelligent you are, preferably someone who is young and says ""wooah dude"" a lot.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Lynch vs Kubrick, with touches of originality.","All the nonsensical violence of a Clockwork Orange, and the oddity factor of a Lynch movie.Most characters in this movie are somehow cold, unfeeling and shallow narcissistic sociopaths, psychopaths, but all have a robotic autistic quality. Some of the characters seem to be altruistic at times, but they are shallow and self-serving gestures that are merely to gain something in return.It is clearly a satire on the pressures of society and the human condition. How we are all indoctrinated from birth into these crazy cultures to accept the clothes we should wear, the behaviors we should follow and the food we should eat, religion, nationalism, about how these societal norms are actually insane. How our lives are warped by the artificial pressures created by societies and the self-interested ways people interact within society, often failing to do the right thing, but following the madness and doing callous things because of societal norms, convenience or fighting for their own self-preservation at the expense of others, or simply doing evil if they think they can get away with it.The cinematography and editing are good, as is the acting, the message is somewhat absurd and abstract in its presentation and the film not particularly enjoyable as entertainment. If you like the style and the message of the satire the movie might work for you and give you a few chuckles, however if you were to watch it in a bad mood, or with the wrong expectations you may end up hating it. Worth a watch as it will get people talking, love or loathe.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Imagination. Symbolism. Love,"I'll start by saying that I love cinematography because this visual art can take me to worlds I have never dared to imagine myself, and this is exactly the case with this film. The plot, being totally surreal, is extremely interesting, has a lot of suspense and gives food for thought from the very start.I'll probably skip the bit explaining what happens (presumably, a lot of other reviews contain that), and say this is a wonderful lesson on symbolism. There are symbols everywhere, even, I dare say, in places where they were not planned by the creators to be ones. We the watchers are free to interpret them, and in my view, this is the most enjoyable part. The cast is great, the script is amazing, the photography superb. And the message of it: personally, I saw it as a film about love. That comes when you least expect. That lasts. That sometimes demands sacrifice. That can be stronger than many other things we know.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
For once a weird movie that I like.,To be honest normally I hate movies where the story is going nowhere filled with meaningless arty farty scenes. When I started watching The Lobster I had not read anything about it and so I was clueless about what was going to come. So after ten minutes I was already wondering what the hell was going on. This was for sure going to be a strange movie. But I actually did like it. As long as the movie goes on you get new strange and weird rules that are actually funny. I don't know what kind of drugs the script writer has been taken but it must be good stuff. The cast was also good. The main character David played by Colin Farrell is enjoyable to watch. What makes the movie good to me is the fact that they live in the future and that there are new rules that we don't know anything about it or that we could not even start to imagine. I can understand that The Lobster is not going to be everybody's cup of tea but I did enjoy it.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unique but slightly disappointing,"Yorgos Lanthimos has the great virtue of looking at our modern world with great insight and dissecting it for us. He turns the insight into a metaphor, and presents the freakishness of our society in essence, for what it is, not or what we've come to accept as normal.In this film, Lanthimos reflects on the pressures that single people have to endure in our society: why are you single? why haven't you married yet? You should date and mate a person like you (meaning, your own social class, race, country, tribe, religion, age, etc.). You should allow somebody else to decide what's best for you (your parents, the group, or the algorithm of a dating site). You shouldn't (mustn't) have sexual relationships with your partner until you marry, or you should have meaningless sexual contacts until you marry. All of those things are societal and cultural, not natural, they treat the single person as an object to manipulate. All of this pressure and questions are analyzed in the film but with a detached mind, masterly, so you might ask, what has this to do with reality? The answer is everything! This is an intellectualizing exercise about reality, the reality of being single in the present day and world.The script is very original -- unique. The actors are all good in their roles, especially having into account the material they've been given. The mood is also great; there is this 70s sort of vintage cold vibe that really suits the story. Some of the scenes in the film are great, as well; my favorite ones being the getaways of the singles to the city, the visit to the supermarket, the flamingo in the middle of the forest, or the group of singles taming their libido with dance music in the middle of the forest. You might find others more of your liking. There are plenty of odd scenes, dialogues and images, some of them really gory, and not my taste, but really impacting.A few things annoyed me in the film, and most of them come from the direction and the script. 1/ I can appreciate the intellectual exercise, but I wasn't able to empathize with any of the characters. The script didn't take me from my head to my heart; a frigid world with frigid characters, even those supposedly in love. I couldn't care about them, unfortunately. 2/ The script is too rigid. The actors had no permission to improvise and develop their characters, something that would have give them depth and humanity. The actors were repeating sentences as robots, and that was what felt like. I'm sure that is intentional but, again, if you don't touch my heart, I won't give a dam about the story. 3/ There are a lot of outdoor scenes in the film, yet the cinematography is grim and alien-like. I thought of the way the forest was incorporated into the story of Fahrenheit 451; the forestry and city in this film are not hostile or beautiful, more flat than anything else. I found they lacked on cinematographic and narrative treatment to incorporate them into the story. It might be intentional, but it didn't work for me. 4/ I was expecting dark deadpan humour and found deadpan horror, so that was a bit of slap on the face; the horror took me aback, and I didn't find enough funny elements, more absurd and grotesque ones.This is one of those films rarely produced in English, certainly an European film because I find difficult to imagine a film like this being produced in the US: elitist, daring, merciless and ruthless. Unique film-making for sure, mentally satisfying, but also disappointing and emotionally frigid to me.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Sad Commentary on Societal Expectations,"As quirky as it is, this film is a strong commentary not only on the rigid ideas human society places on its relationships, but also on the shallow expectations we have of each other. David is willing to lie in order to fit in, then once he does 'fit in' (in the wrong place) he has to lie again in order to be accepted. Apparently it never occurs to him to ask questions or to try to be authentic. It's more important in this film to fit into what the establishment dictates.The pace of the film is a bit disjointed, which can cause a disconnect. While the dry humor often hits its mark, sometimes the viewer can find himself getting the joke about three minutes later.The reviews I've seen from many people who claim this movie is ""slow"" and ""boring"" frustrate me. I might expect that from Joe Movie Goer, but not from a professional reviewer. Too many of them have forgotten that film is an art form, one that is not built on instant gratification. If the latter is what you're seeking, go find a chick flick. For a movie that makes you think, The Lobster is a good choice.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The second film I have walked out of.,"For the 7.30 screening, the 79-seat auditorium was at least three quarters full, and the majority of people were laughing and enjoying it- I must have watched a different film, because I found this to be unwatchable, an absolutely irredeeming film, devoid of anything worth caring about.Story of a man, at an undisclosed time in the future, being confined to a mysterious hotel for 45 days, during which time, he systematically must find a mate, or be turned into an animal of his choice seemed odd to me, but positive reviews piqued my interest, and I gave it a go, but when the film begins with a woman shooting a cow in the head, I quickly regretted my decision.Everything, all of the characters and their dialogue, every situation they're in, every frame of this movie is so dry and muted that it all just comes across as flat and boring, except for the animal cruelty. I just didn't care about any of the characters or the situation they were in, I tuned out so much by about 45 minutes in.Then, ...kicking a dog to death and showing its bloodied body and trying to pass that off as some type of biting satirical wit was vile.Repulsive.Repugnant.As a dog lover, I was nauseated and angry. I left the cinema. I walked out. I didn't care about anything in the film, none of the characters interested me, I could not, and still can't, think of a redeeming quality or value.

Lucky lobster,"In a dystopian future, single people are sent to The Hotel, where they have 45 days to find a soul mate, or they will be transformed into animals. It's a dark comedy about relationships, social pressure, loneliness and self-love. Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (The Favorite), The Lobster is a bizarre and peculiar film, wrapped in a melancholic and dense atmosphere, yet attractive, and almost hypnotic. Among people who are destined to be together, others who prefer to live a lie, to be socially accepted, or those who are ostracized for feeling comfortable alone, there is a well-told story, although the pace could be different, allowing the characters to have another dynamic. The film fails by not scrutinizing the transformation (into animals), leaving an emptiness that could have connected some loose ends of the story, for more coherence. The photography works well with the narrative, with a palette of cool colors and a saturation that matches the mood.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Painful Viewing,","The Lobster is a diabolical film with a poorly written plot and a top notch cast that are not given any chance to display their talents here. Apparently it is meant to be funny, but it is for a very, very acquired taste, some jokes are extremely dry and others are over to the top, as well as tasteless.I am a fan of many of the cast members, particularly Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz and John C. Reilly, but none of them give anything to their character, because of a poor decision the director made to have everyone be motionless. As a result of that, it is impossible to support or care for them on their journey, as they do not seem to care themselves.The films genre is also all over the place, I know it was on purpose, but when you are a romantic comedy, with a bit of drama and elements of science fiction, but without any special effects, it becomes messy and hard for an audience to keep up with. Unfunny and simply boring to watch, The Lobster suffers from the fact that the director is trying so hard to deliver a groundbreaking and original story that he forgets what makes a movie compelling in the first place.A recently divorced man is forced to go to a hotel, in which he is given 45 days to find a new love, or else he must become a different animal.Best Performance: Colin Farrell / Worst Performance: Olivia Colman",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bizarre But in a Great Way,"On June 5, 2016 at 9:55pm MST I sat down to watch what just might have been the most damning indictment of society, sexuality, loneliness and mortality I have ever seen. The Lobster, while being utterly off-kilter, weird and occasionally sweet has a humor as black as a Cuban espresso and a message as fatalistic as a Franz Kafka story. Director Yorgos Lanthimos may have made a name for himself with the equally deadpan Dogtooth (2009) but it is The Lobster that elevates him beyond the mantel of youthful provocateur. This guy is a one-man Molotov cocktail, meticulously creating his own little absurd world before tearing it apart.The Lobster takes place in a near-future dystopian society where being single is completely illegal. If death or divorce does occur, people are brought to ""The Hotel"" where they are to meet someone new within 45 days. If they fail to make a match, they're turned into an animal of their own choosing and as the Hotel's (Colman) concierge puts it ""find another chance for love."" David (Farrell), a recent divorcée is brought to the Hotel with his brother (a Border Collie) in tow. Mustached, bespectacled, slightly overweight and awkward even by deadpan dystopia standards, David tries his best to find his one and only.Much like the buttery shellfish this film takes it's name from, The Lobster is certainly an acquired taste. Characters awkwardly shuffle across the screen speaking in impassive, wooden phrases hinting at their desperation, their insecurities and their disconnectedness. Even when not paying mind to the Hotel's strict code of conduct, the social mores of Lanthimo's world requires partnerships start with a physical commonality. David makes friends with the Lisping Man (Reilly) and the Limping Man (Whishaw), both of whom hope to find partners with their defining features. When the Limping Man fails, he switches gears and purposely starts nosebleeds to get the attention of Jessica Barden...known as you guessed it: the Nosebleed Woman. Those unable to find a partner can extend their stay by going on the hunt and tranquilizing hordes of militant singles who hide in the forest. The Heartless Woman (Papoulia) is infamous for this, extending her stay by about a year based on captures alone.This is the kind of exaggerated, bleak, freakishly and fiendishly clever world building you can expect to find in this film. A film that aptly skewers modern society's views on relationships and equates elaborate social norms as nothing more than bestial courtships, many of which are based on lies and lunacy. Once we leave the Hotel and enter the forest, the movie slowly shifts like an ice shelf into a blossoming romance mixed with a visual anarchism that excites comparisons to the second half of Godard's Weekend (1967). The resemblance is made even more conspicuous in a scene where singles enter the city to gather provisions in a slow-motion dance of consumerist glee; abruptly followed by a return to savagery.This takes place in the second part of the film which unfortunately fails to match the absurd high-points of the first half-hour. The film replaces these flourishes of the bizarre with sentimentality that certainly feel sincere; though a little wanting by comparison. Still, flashes of incongruous brilliance still linger within the frame, even providing one or two divine comic set-piece that couldn't have happened without shifts in scenery. As for the ending...oof, how about that ending!In it's own understated way, The Lobster is one of the best art- house imports offered in the last decade. While decidedly not for everyone, those already exhausted by this year's lackluster summer movie schedule might want to try this bold little experiment on. Though word to the weary, The Lobster may not be a movie for couples. If you decide to go with a loved one on date night, keep the steak knives out of arm's reach.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
reminds me of the late 50s/early 60s Theatre of the Absurd,"The film is convincing in the sense that the director has the actors, particularly Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, give completely believable performances, directly in the face of reality. Everything rolls along with its own logical progression but all is nonsense. This reminds me of the late 50s/early 60s Theatre of the Absurd, spine tinglingly confrontational plays that might have triggered some base connection with long distant animal past but looked crazy. There may even be a nod to Ionesco's 1959 play Rhinoceros in The Lobster. Dogtooth (2009) was difficult to watch because it was so disturbing and understandable, whilst remaining horrific. Here, particularly when we go out into the woods and real connection with reality seems diminished and it becomes too hard to relate to the terrible goings on.

"Unique, Awkward, and Very Amusing","I've wanted to see The Lobster for a while, as it sounded like a pretty weird yet interesting movie. I'm very happy to say that it completely met up with, and surpassed, my expectations.The Lobster has a very, very different plot. It's one that I've never seen and probably doesn't exist anywhere else. It's extremely original, but what's originality without knowing what to do with it? Luckily, Yorgos Lanthimos knew exactly what he was doing, and he did a fantastic job.The characters and their exchanges are one of the best things about the film. They range from extremely awkward to completely psychotic. It really sets the mood of the movie when you know that despite how weirdly innocent it is it can also be very dark and disturbing. All the characters are great, and you really care about and know them by the end of the movie.The movie's awkwardness combined with the plot can make for some very funny exchanges and scenes. Sometimes a conversation is so awkward that you can't help but laugh at it, while other times there's something so surreal about a scene that it's just funny to look at.Overall The Lobster is a very different movie. It's nothing like what you'd expect in a sci-fi romance, and because of this it's easily one of the best movies of the year.

A quirky and playful yet despicable comedy,"I never really thought about how film has the power to translate extreme theatrical styles and ideas onto the big screen, until I watched The Lobster. Borrowing heavily from Absurdism, this science fiction artwork from Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos is disguised as a quirky and playful yet despicable comedy that presents a relevant commentary on relationships in the world in which we live. It does so in an original fashion that is becoming exceedingly rare in modern cinema.Let's place ourselves in the familiar situation of the not-too distant dystopian future, and imagine that we are imprisoned in a remote hotel, and if we fail to find a suitable romantic partner in 45 days, we are turned into an animal of our own choosing. This is an idea that sounds both interesting and frightening at the same time, but is without doubt innovative, as is the rest of the narrative. The plot is unpredictable and expertly paced, and balances moments of shock and anguish with spasms of rupturing laughter. If I mention any in this review, I will have made the same mistake as the movie's trailer did, and that is reveal too much of the film. What the trailer doesn't reveal is the enormous complexity of the film's message; neither side (being in a relationship versus being single) is an ideal side, and that the real nature of society is not restricted to black and white.For a film with a budget of just over $8 million, the film boasts an ensemble cast that takes the wheel of this film with little effort. The residents at the hotel include Ben Winshaw (Skyfall and Perfume) and John C. Reilly (Step Brothers and Guardians of the Galaxy), while the rebels hiding in the woods include Léa Seydoux (Spectre and Mission Impossible IV) and Rachel Weisz (The Mummy and The Fountain). Most of these unnamed characters support the protagonist David, played by an unrecognisable Colin Farrell, whose character development propels the film even further.In terms of execution, the cinematography is exquisitely composed, and is complemented by the bleak colour palette. Returning to the sci-fi features of the film, I applaud Lanthimos's choice to employ normal locations such as hotels, woods and cities to show how the possibility of a dystopian future is very real and very imminent. However, I feel that he may have indulged too heavily in the usage of slow-motion, and the recurrence of the same piece of music quickly wore out its welcome. Upon further reflection, this technique not only symbolises the cyclical nature of the world portrayed in the film, but dodges a few of nasty entanglements associated with copyrighted music. Overall, The Lobster, while undoubtedly eccentric and esoteric, was quite enjoyable to watch in my opinion. Having seen it in the cinema, I was initially confounded as to how many people (mostly contumelious seniors) complained about it and/or walked out. However, that did not ruin my own experience of watching the film; a sign of a very good film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Eye for an Eye,"""The Lobster"" is certainly an off-beat dark comedy and satire. The dystopian depiction of state-enforced couplings and the equally rigid renegade singles is rather simplistic, but the absurdity of it all is quite amusing. In it, those not already bonded to a romantic partner are forced to check into a hotel with other singles, whereupon they have 45 days to pair up or be surgically transformed into the lower animal of their choice (hence the title). Indeed, David (Colin Farrell) brings his brother, who is now a dog, along with him. Hotel guests--or, rather, inmates--also have the chance to extend their stays by slaying the renegade singles, who like other ""uncivilized"" animals inhabit the woods. To encourage the marriages, the hotel performs parables on a stage for the guests (a woman saving a man from choking at dinner, and the man protecting the woman from being raped on a walk) and enforce symbolic punishments (on the first day, inmates have one arm tied behind their backs). Punishments for other offenses, along with those applied by the loners in the forest, have the flare of the Code of Hammurabi or Biblical laws of retaliation. A man who masturbates--a decidedly singular act--in the hotel has the masturbatory hand burned in a toaster. Likewise, acts requiring a partner are similarly punished by the loners, whereas masturbation is accepted.""The Lobster"" is most amusing while occupying the hotel; whereas, it threatens to derail into a self-contradictory celebration of coupling in the woods when David meets Rachel Weisz's character, who up until then had been providing monotone narration. Their shared short-sightedness (note the use of this term instead of ""near-sighted"") marks them to be together, just as one's defining characteristic--in a society that reduces one to be identified by their limp, nose bleeds, lisps, sociopathy or what have you--required one to find a mate with the same trait at the hotel. Fortunately, however, writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos and company don't settle for such a cop out of affirming the state-repressed individuality in rom-com banality. The acting remains intentionally stilted and the characters entirely unsophisticated. As the pun with the main couple's sight underscores, this is a world where an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

relax it's an allegory,"The mistake you could easily make is treating this as a dystopian future, instead of a complete break with reality. You could make yourself very unhappy rooting for sensible things to happen in this film, but that would be a case of having an incorrect framework ... like getting seriously upset when peter griffin pulls his own eye outso the word you're looking for is *allegory*. At it's core, The Lobster is simply a statement that society is made for couples, and if you're not in a couple then on some level you are an outcast (regardless of what you pretend to yourself).

"Love, Loneliness & Absurdity","Original and thought-provoking film that blends dark humor with social commentary. I loved how the film explores themes of loneliness, conformity, and the absurdity of societal expectations regarding love.The performances are wonderfully restrained and deadpan, with Colin Farrell delivering an excellent turn as David, a man who reluctantly enters this bizarre system of love and relationships. The surreal nature of the world Lanthimos has created is both unsettling and darkly funny, with every interaction feeling oddly mechanical yet deeply human.One of the film's standout elements is its visual style. Lanthimos uses minimalistic sets and muted tones, which contribute to the film's cold and alienating atmosphere. The choice to keep the emotional tone understated throughout enhances the absurdity of the story, making each odd situation more unsettling and poignant.What truly elevates The Lobster is its exploration of the limitations of societal norms and the rigid expectations placed on individuals when it comes to love and relationships. The film provocatively critiques the pressures of conforming to traditional ideas of romance, while also touching on the paradoxes that arise from trying to force genuine connections in such an artificial context.Ultimately, The Lobster is a unique and daring cinematic experience that invites viewers to question their own assumptions about love, loneliness, and identity. With its combination of thought-provoking themes, dark humor, and striking visuals, it's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll.Highly recommended for those who enjoy films that challenge conventions and spark meaningful discussion.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
More absurd than necessary,"The Lobster is a very difficult movie to assess. Its premise is so ridiculous and absurd that it's bound to be a divisive movie that isn't for everyone. The first half in particular is a difficult sit through, as due to their absurdity, many story elements seem completely random at first. It's only halfway through that things seem to click together, and an impressively cohesive story emerges. I'm actually so impressed with the underlying story, that I believe this would have made a terrific science fiction movie if played a little more seriously.It is basically a movie about a dystopian future in which people are forced to become married or run the risk of being turned into an animal, or being hunted if trying to avoid this outcome. There are some very interesting reflections on the pressures of society to find a partner and the superficial ways that people get together and pretend to be someone else in order to avoid ending up alone. Interestingly, the fugitive group of loners is equally as radical in their approach, forcing their members to stay alone and punishing them for showing any type of romantic affection towards another. I see this broadly as a remark on society in general, in which there are extremists on both ends of the political spectrum, each hating the other, but neither one being particularly desirable from a neutral point of view. Like always, the truth is somewhere in the middle.I found myself being thoroughly engaged in these ideas, but at times were taken out of it by the absurdist nature of many of the scenes. The deadpan and deliberately wooden acting is quirky and interesting at first, but grows tiresome rather quickly, and the dialogue seemed very scripted and unnatural (as it was intended). I also personally didn't think it was as funny as the writers hoped I would think, being left confused and frustrated at some scenes rather than laughing at them.I'm sure many will disagree, and believe the absurdity is at the core of the film and the movie wouldn't have worked without it. Indeed, it might have run the risk of being a little more run-of-the-mill if played more seriously and left in less capable hands. However, the underlying ideas were so strong that I really don't think it needed the excessive absurdity. I believe this might be a case of the writers underestimating the quality of their screenplay and throwing in some quirky things to make it seem a bit more alternative and anti-mainstream than it needed to be. Even the central concept of turning into an animal if failing to find a partner within 45 days was superfluous to the main story. The movie would have worked just as well if a different type of punishment was presented. Or at least it could have been given a bit more prominence. The fact that the animals that are walking around were once humans is being mentioned in a throwaway line or two, but never really fully explored.I'm not saying it should have been a full on dark and gritty science-fiction drama. It could have retained its satirical outlook, which suits the story quite well. It just went a little overboard with trying to seem as weird and quirky as possible, which is a shame as The Lobster is now mainly being remembered as 'that weird movie in which humans turn into animals', even though there's so much more to this great story.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love,"Farrell is fantastic in this role, displaying machismo and fragility in equal measure. And for me, Rachel Weisz missed out on a fair Oscar nomination for this film.The Lobster has almost everything you want from a movie. It's unpredictable, eccentric, funny and there's something that leaves you with when the film ends.My mom and I saw it, and it was shocking to both of us how this movie made us talk for almost two hours about it. I got out of a long term relationship recently, and she's a widow, so this movie really depends on how willing you are to lower your emotional armor for the idea of the work. Its most impressive feature, the subtext, manages to reflect how voracious modern social pressures are and the complexity of Love and Pain as something that co-exists.Loneliness is feared by all of us, and this film shows. Not only in the face of a dominant system, but how some people stay alone simply to avoid feeling in the void that loneliness proposes. This is shown in the film.It is certainly one of the most impactful films I have ever seen about society and love, when my mother and I finished talking about it, we simply wanted to hug each other.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

She cares for dogs excessively, and she'd rather end her life than join another cult or become an animal. She's desperate, unlike the blonde girl with the nice hair.

Film Liquet on The Lobster,"Made by the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, there is no wonder that ""The Lobster"" makes you feel completely uncomfortable and uneasy, showing off the director's script writing techniques and unique style. The plot centres around a dystopian future, where single people are placed in a hotel and given 45 days to find a romantic partner or otherwise they will be turned into animals. Starring Colin Farrell as a newly single man trying to find a partner in order to remain human, after failing to do so, he decides to flee and become a loner - who the people in the hotel hunt, which extends their stay in the hotel.With an absurd fictional storyline, the film delivers an interesting premise, criticizing the ridiculousness of forcing someone to fall in love due to common interests, or forcing someone to get married, being a common practice. Commenting on the social pressure that is put on the adults, along with the notion of putting people into boxing, not allowing bi-s well as not allowing shoes that are between sizes.I am not a fan of the director's works; however, I try to remain unbiased when judging the work. The content along with the plot of the movie throws a lot of people off because of the ridiculous concepts, however it is in that ridicule that the director exposes the real life flaws of different cultures and social activities, such as critiques of marriage. The film is shot with a lot of thought put into it, the shots are well framed and show off the breath-taking locations of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Collin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, along with the other cast members add to the film greatly.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

If not, they will be changed to an animal of their choice.""The Lobster"" is very different from any film I watched recently. The tone of the film is strangely eerie without any eerie or scary effects effects. It achieves the strange feeling by strange societal rules and impersonal interpersonal interaction. Though I say strange, if you think hard about the society depicted in the film, it actually echoes a lot of the real world, only more exaggerated, organised and disturbing. It is a very interesting reflection on the strange world we live in, and makes us realise that our world is more dysfunctional than we cognate.",,Anonymous,Romance

In the second half we see the exact opposite and another different story. It is a dark and weird romance and it points out the power of love. Furthermore it shows the crazy things that people do for the person that they love

A unique and interesting yet dull film,"I feel like no matter how many time I watch this film, I'm never going to
""get it"". I can see the commentary on modern relationships and such, but so much of it just doesn't make sense and I'm not sure it's supposed to. The less you now about The Lobster going in, the better the experience will be, so I'll keep it brief and spoiler free. The biggest things that the movie has going for it is the story, which is insane and for every question it half answers, I have three more. The movie is essentially two distinct parts and while I loved learning about how the world worked in the first half, the second half slowed down and stopped addressing my questions. There is too much that they won't explain and instead try and lead you on to another thing. Beyond the very interesting story, there really isn't much else going on. Every character talks in the same emotionless monotone, which sometimes adds to the very dry humor and other times just gets annoying. ""Dry"" is a good descriptor of the whole movie. The camera shots are dry and static, the dialog is dry, every character has basically the same dry personality, the score is dry classical music, everything is ""dry"". I liked the story and occasionally found it mildly funny, but every scene left me wanting more. By the half way point, I was disinterested with the characters and much more intrigued by the world they live in and we learn so little about it. The Lobster is one of those movies that can't possibly find financial success, because it's hard to market to a specific audience. It's listed as a comedy, but it's not really funny, especially for a standard audience. The static monotone acting from everyone got on my nerves and I assume a general audience would find it even more grating. It's a very unique story, but the way it's told puts way too much effort into being ""quirky"" and ""wacky"".",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Concise and Critical on Society's Moral Values,"The social commentary, exploration and criticism that it provides for societal expectations and norms of coupling, heteronormarcy, co-dependency, adulthood, a one sided toxic perception(s) or portrayal of 'romance', intimacy and sexual gratification, fascism and tyranny is actually quite intriguing to not only be challenged on but also with a viewing experience of The Lobster, it highlights that these social factors must be challenged, changed, applied individually and not collectively as humans are rather rather complex within ourselves.We have to a moral standard that should be upheld and The Lobster does a great job in terms of highlighting how exactly we are able to go down immoral expectations of each other and ourselves. Ultimately, we do not have to uphold certain societal norms and values such as being subjected by fascism and toxic regimes, we hold power as people to change things for the better through challenging them firstly.It portrays these immoral expectations and rules put in place by regimes by presenting a considerably extreme concept of coupling etc, however the message still stands strong and bold nonetheless.I would like to think that Yorgos and Efthimis thought to provoke and incite commentary on a human's obsession with over saturated ideas of love and what gives life meaning altogether. Ideally, I see the film as a screenplay which is providing an argument which states that upholding tradition and powering through unstable unions is not the answer or the cure for loneliness, unhappiness and death.Additionally there are some great notions to challenge on expectations of genre roles, gender role enforcement, support of patriarchy, subordination of women. The film really is succinct, gets to the point, found myself rooting for the protagonist, great exposition set up, shots and narrative progression.This line alone sums up a lot of the film's exploration of union and how intrinsically toxic they are capable of becoming

Stoic love story,"Very good character introductions and world building, nothing's explained, no backstory to how this world came to be; you just learn about it as you go. I loved that almost all the characters are peculiar, something weird, dark or sad about them. Some of the pairings even seem awkward, like imagining yourself in their shoes in that moment would've been uncomfortable.I love that everything's normal as well, nobody is particularly complaining about anything that's weird about this world, which is basically everything. On the few times it comes up it's very composed. I loved the emotionless nature of it, from the acting to visuals. Everything about the movie was eerie and uncomfortably weird.It's slow paced but every minute felt purposeful and cinematic, maintains a serene aura even through the hunt scenes for instance. Doesn't stray towards being anything other than a drama. I did find few of the conversations hilarious though, far from comedy though. I loved the stoic narration too, and that ends up being the way to describe the love story.This is very unique, does feels like the Handmaid's tale but not as twisted. Does feel like satire at times, like the conversation about children fixing things. I have mixed feelings about the end, I do think it could've been better, then again I can't think of a better way so who am I to complain. It still felt like a fitting conclusion to the movie, just felt a little abrupt as well.I don't think everything was fully exploited from the movie, hard to understand what you're supposed to get from it, feels like the idea of the movie kept swaying from one thing to another, but without ever feeling disoriented or absentminded. So I can't quite place my feelings about it afterwards, despite enjoying it.It's not for everyone. A very strange movie I'd be hesitant to recommend but it's still a good one. I'm usually drawn into the romance side of things but this is more of a dark, strange dystopian film, which I also love.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Did you dig your grave?""","The Lobster (2015) -What on Earth, literally, happened to society for it to become the dystopian world portrayed in this film?What events lead to the human race becoming so devoid of emotion and so very ""Special""? People who were personally invasive and matter of fact, forthright to a fault, quizzical like children and irritating in many ways to watch on screen.In some ways I felt that the assorted characters behaviour was like the 'Haribo' adverts in which adults are voiced over by children, because the dialogue was so basic and naive, almost innocent and without feeling or heart of any sort. That sort of delivery that 'French & Saunders' (1987-2017) might give whilst playing kids in one of their sketches.The focus in this odd future was David, played by Colin Farrell had the choice to be turned in to an animal (I assumed that they had started to all become extinct and this was mankind's way of making up for it) or pair up with someone as part of a strange 45 day dating programme in a regimented hotel, almost akin to a mash up of 'Love Island' (2015-), 'Big Brother' (2000-) and an army boot camp.I had to wonder if the creators of 'Andor' (2022-) had modeled their prison scenes on the hotel shown here, because it was all very robotic and their were punishments to be suffered for infractions of the rules.I wasn't sure of the message that the creators of the film were trying to express. Was it showing up the world of today, with the pressure on all of us to get married, have kids, etc and with our disregard for other animal life, or was it suggesting a potential future that we might end up living in, because of HOW we are living today, a future where we have to behave so abnormally to make up for our actions in our current present? Without knowing any sort of scientific reason for the depicted change to our world it was hard to tell. Maybe there was no message at all and it was just an excuse for the studio to make something extreme and very, very out there? A way to put ideas on screen that wouldn't normally be seen?It seemed to be mocking the traditional idea of soulmates and marriage, as it stands today and it suggested that the characters must only pair up with those of a similar situation to their own to an extreme degree - A limping man should try to find a connection with a woman who had a prosthetic leg/A short-sighted Man with a woman who wears contact lenses, that sort of thing, as if that was how relationships would work in this odd future.It was these strange elements that made me feel there was a bit too much information missing for me to understand how our society had somehow reached this weird future.In general the film reminded me of those really bizarre weddings that have sometimes been depicted in other films and TV series, because of the hotel set up, meeting strangers in a really awkward fashion and essentially trying to hook up with someone before going home, because you don't want to end up with cousin Greg again, whose been giving you the eye all day.And the hunting of those who refused to be paired up OR turned in to animals (Loners) felt like a weird stag party activity, that not everyone was that in to. A camping trip, but the best man thought it would be interesting to go the whole weekend without booze and sex, so it's just a trip to the woods, despite the weather.I also felt that the hunting aspect and the way that the ""Loners"" lived presented an element of 'The Hunger Games' (2012).As such, it was all very juxtaposed with too many elements and there were times that I found it to be quite psychotic and inappropriate, with moments of absolute disgusting sickness. Clearly the writers and directors were disturbed and were just trying to find a way to stand out.I definitely didn't need to see the bits where animals were mistreated. They were shown far more often than necessary, if needed at all.I did however appreciate the use of the other random animals dotted throughout the background of the shots to show the people that had not managed to find a partner during the 45 day process and the obviously strange choices of animals that they had opted for.Colin Farrell's role reminded me of Dougal (Ardal O'Hanlon) from 'Father Ted' (1995-8), because of the strange, childish and comedic way he had to act. Obviously his accent contributed to that too.Other than that it would be hard to say how well the cast performed, because of their monotone and obscure delivery, but nobody amongst them seemed to stick out as wrong, even the Limping Man played by Ben Whishaw who normally irritates me.The film clearly made an impression on me, whether for good or for bad because I've had so much to say in this review. I could see that there was a place in the world for it to a degree, but it wasn't a type that I need to see a lot of or regularly. It was definitely an odd, but very interesting concept, but it was also terrifying, cringey and absurd.569.88/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Embracing the Absurd: 'The Lobster' Weaves Satire and Melancholy into a Dystopian Delight,"In the realm of cinematic oddities, ""The Lobster"" stands as a testament to the sheer force of creative will. It is a film that defies easy categorization, straddling the line between the absurd and the profound. Director Yorgos Lanthimos crafts a dystopian satire that is as unsettling as it is humorous, a rare blend that tickles the intellect while occasionally punching the gut.The film's premise is bizarre yet intriguing: in a society where single people are transformed into animals if they fail to find a partner within 45 days, ""The Lobster"" explores themes of conformity, desperation, and the human need for connection. Colin Farrell's portrayal of the protagonist, David, is a masterclass in subdued desperation. His journey through the film's peculiar world is both a literal and metaphorical search for companionship, and Farrell imbues the character with a palpable sense of melancholy.The supporting cast, including Rachel Weisz and Léa Seydoux, bring depth to the film's peculiar narrative. Their performances are nuanced, balancing the script's deadpan humor with moments of genuine emotion. The cinematography is equally noteworthy, with Thimios Bakatakis providing a cold, clinical gaze that perfectly complements the story's sterile environment.The film's dialogue is deliberately stilted, reflecting the characters' internal struggles and the society's oppressive nature. It is a bold choice that pays off, as it adds to the film's unique tone and atmosphere. The score, composed by Johnnie Burn, is minimalistic yet haunting, further enhancing the film's eerie quality.However, its pacing can be glacial, which, while reflective of the characters' emotional states, may test the patience of some viewers. The film's third act also diverges from its established rhythm, leading to a conclusion that feels somewhat disjointed from the rest of the narrative.Despite these criticisms, ""The Lobster"" is a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. It is a bold statement on the absurdity of societal norms and the lengths to which people will go to fit in. Lanthimos has created a world that is both familiar and alien, a place where the laughable and the lamentable coexist in uneasy harmony.""The Lobster"" is a film that challenges viewers to embrace its peculiarity. It is a work that rewards those willing to engage with its idiosyncrasies and overlook its occasional missteps. For those seeking cinema that ventures off the beaten path, ""The Lobster"" is a journey worth taking.",,Anonymous,Romance
good experience,"This film is the fourth film I've seen by Yorgos Lanthimos and I can easily say that this man is crazy! To be honest, my thoughts about Yorgos Lanthimos films have not been generally positive, but this film has changed all my ideas. The subject of the film's criticism, and the fact that it takes place in a dystopia, deeply affects the feelings of the audience. I can't say there are no shortcomings, but the subject is so engrossing so that you can ignore it. Besides, I want to say something about Colin Farrell. I always thought Colin Farrell was a very talented actor, but in this film Colin Farrell has shown his talent in another dimension! After the film is finished, we can say that it will be a film experience that you will think about for a long time, especially the colors and the emotions of the colors seemed to touch the soul of the person.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Delightful,"The Lobster is beautiful and sickening. The tone is awkward for the vast majority of the movie and that makes it so much fun to watch.

"A very strange, but very humorous black comedy.","It was a strange and disturbing metaphor for society.Collin Ferrell plays a man who just broke up with his wife and is forced to take up residency in a strange hotel resort badly designed to show you how important it is to be in a relationship, by having you do strange exercises like hunting down single people who are living in the woods, because society has outlawed being alone, and force you to commit to a new relationship with the threat of being turned into your favorite animal if you fail.I get the feeling this is an outburst for the filmmakers who are not happy about the pressure society can put on someone to be in a relationship. I love how the movie kinda showed how relationships run their course and how we look for people who are similar to us. Specifically the resort for single people tended to match up people with the most superficial similarities like short slightness or a limp.Collin Ferrell gives his all in his performance by doing very little, and I also like Rachael Weiz, whose character narrates the story.I found the Lobster to be a true art form as it narrated and interesting dystopian tale which symbolism are a good reflection on today's society, and overall the story is well played out.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Might be the best movie of the year,"The Lobster is about as quirky as they come; a surreal deadpan depiction of some alternate universe or perhaps our future (I'm not sure which the filmmakers were leaning towards) in which partnership is a legal requirement and to be alone is to be a lesser being. It's a story billed as dystopian, but with the complexity and sophistication that this civilization is run, perhaps our heroes who work to fight the system are merely traitors.The opening scene depicts a woman driving down a country road and then exiting her car to calmly shoot and kill a donkey in a field. Having completed this movie, one wonders what this donkey could have possibly done done to deserve it. We learn the processes and meanings later. In the simplest description, this is a society in which people who are single (whether due to death or divorce) must refuge in a sort of resort for loners, a large hotel in which newly-single folk must meet like-minded people in order to mate and return to society. Assuming you can't find a companion within 30 days of arriving, you are turned into an animal of your choice and released into the wild, forever doomed to be mute and alone.David is our protagonist (a deadpan Colin Farrell, he's fantastic) who enters the resort with his brother (a yappy dog, transformed by the same resort 4 years prior) after his wife leaves him for another man with glasses. He is given a single room, 4 complete suits, shoes, and instructions to never use the volleyball or tennis courts. Those are reserved for couples. He eats all 3 meals at an individual table (curious since socialization is the key to meeting others), attends stiff formal dances catered by the building managers, and regularly goes in groups to the nearby woods to hunt loners who have escaped the grounds.The story indeed makes for one of the most unique pieces of cinema I have ever seen. The tone is that of a black comedy, and humor is found not in actions or situations, but rather the curious nature of these characters. They speak in a simple English, and there is a bleak sound to it. David speaks with a textbook-like vernacular. He never laughs, never yells, and seems content with living out his remainder as a human in relative peace.Not only do our characters require a mate, but they also must settle down with someone of a similar trait. A fellow exile picks a woman who frequently gets nosebleeds and insists that banging his head on the table to cause a drip from his nose will make them a perfect couple. Another unsuccessfully tries to find a woman with a similar lisp to his.One thing leads to another, and David escapes to join a band of loners in the nearby woods (the loners hunted every night). There he falls in love with a short-sighted woman (Rachel Weisz in one of her best roles). How curious that David is also short-sighted, and how deeply sad that these foresters forbid relationships as a form of rebellion to society.Yorgos Lanthimos is the director and co-writer, Greek in descent and with a decidedly European sensibility to his film. His work, while challenging, concludes on a note that will leave some audiences confused and others amazed by the simplicity of it. Along with ""Her,"" here is another modern film that works to dissect love and relationships in a way that we have not yet seen before. There is much to discuss about the film, and there is even more to debate. It's one of the very best films this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absorbing first act gives way to a rambling latter half,"Early in 2015, word-of-mouth was spreading from festival-goers that The Lobster was a strange masterpiece, a dark and bleakly hilarious portrayal of modern relationships that could even compete for the Oscars as long as the voters were not put off by the general weirdness. It however limped into cinemas with little promotion (that I saw), gaining positive reviews from the critics, but was notably absent during awards season. This may have been down to the film being simply too out-there, but I believe it's down to the fact that the incredible precision of the first act gives way to a depressingly bleak and rambling latter half.The first half of the film is where Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos sets the scene for this not-too-distant living nightmare, where couples must either find a loving partner or face being turned into an animal of their choice. Sullen David (Colin Farrell) arrives at a hotel in middle-of-nowhere Ireland hoping to find a mate. The rules are simple - find love within 45 days or become a wild beast, and David has decided he is to be a lobster. Escape into the surrounding woods and you'll have your former buddies hunting you at night with a tranquilliser gun in the hope of gaining an extra day for each 'kill'. David tries courting the 'Heartless Woman' (Angeliki Papoulia), as she is billed, but things turn sour and he decides to make off into the trees.The hotel scenes are mostly uncomfortably hilarious. David's new friend, 'The Limping Man' (Ben Whishaw), tries to find common ground with 'Nosebleed Woman' (Jessica Barden) by bashing his head against a wall to cause his nose to gush so they can share something in common, while the Lisping Man (John C. Reilly) is forced by the stern Hotel Manager (Olivia Colman) to put his hand in a toaster as a punishment for masturbating (which is strictly forbidden, while the inhabitants are forced to receive a dry humping from the Maid (Ariane Labed) without ejaculating every morning). Courtship here is routine and emotionless, likely commenting on the ridiculous state of modern dating, which is usually based on linking shared interests and statistics electronically. Whatever happened to a good old natural spark?It's also depressing, but absorbingly so, but loses its pace once David is in the woods. He meets the leader of escaped hotel guests the Loners, played by Lea Seydoux, whose way of life seems even harsher than the hotels. Romance and sexual activity are punishable by violence and mutilation, but nevertheless David falls in love with the 'Short Sighted Woman' (Rachel Weisz). Once the focus shifts away from the Hotel and the bizarre hook of the films title, the film is just not as interesting while in the world of the Loners. The satire loses its edge and the story could have benefited from 15 minutes or so shaved off. Still, The Lobster is an oddball experience I would recommend anyone to sit through at least once, and features a terrifically restrained performance from Farrell, playing against type.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Offbeat, timely, and profound: the best thing I've seen this year","The Lobster, with its absurd premise and stilted dialogue delivery, breaks countless cinematic rules and the expectations of even a seasoned audience to become arguably one of the best movies to have been made this year.Colin Farrell plays David, a middle-aged man whose wife has recently left him. In this dystopian world of his, single people are taken to a hotel, where they are given a chance to find themselves partners within fortyfive days, failing which they are turned into an animal of their choice. Once David checks into the hotel, he's issued clothes and shoes, and assigned a single room. If he manages to find a partner, he will be upgraded to a double room, and the hotel management will monitor his relationship for four weeks before allowing him and his partner to move to the city together. Residents at the hotel can extend their stay by hunting down escapees, who they tranquilise with dart guns – each loner hunted down adds an extra day to the hunter's stay. After David escapes from the hotel, he comes upon a band of renegades who have, if possible, an even stricter code to live by. They are loners, and are forbidden any sexual interaction. When he meets a woman among them (Rachel Weisz) who is short-sighted like him, they fall in love and plan to escape to the city together.This is as far as I am willing to go in revealing the plot. I am told that Yorgos Lanthimos, the director, typically uses stilted dialogue and ritualised actions in his films. The Lobster is his first English venture and features both heavily. The rather offbeat humour might take some getting used to. What is striking, however, is the quiet undercurrent of desperation that both Farrell and Weisz manage to channel underneath those poker faces. The deadpan expressions of all the characters and the near-surgical precision with which they communicate with each other belies the tragedy of living in a world where the worth of people are measured by their romantic proclivities. Rather paradoxically, the eccentricities of the characters, the events, and the plot serve to heighten this feeling of world-weariness, and makes the film more believable for viewers.In fact, The Lobster is ultimately a success because of its paradoxes. Invigoratingly ambitious and enthusiastically weird till the very end, it plays out like an Orwellian ballad for the twentyfirst century, a masterful allegory of the times. It's one of those movies that work because they capture the zeitgeist so wonderfully. In a decade that has seen the rise of Tinder, OkCupid, dating algorithms, left-swiping, and selfies, no movie seems more timely, no movie sounds more urgent. Spike Jonze's Her, another movie of this decade on the theme of futuristic dating, seems laughably optimistic in retrospect. The Lobster is not only far cleverer, it is also far more breathtakingly imaginative, and so wonderfully scripted that it was hard to find faults with, except perhaps the presence of a few lines of dialogue in French which added nothing to the movie, seeing as how the film-makers deemed it unnecessary to provide subtitles for them. All said and done, this is a movie that awards repeated viewing and will, I can staunchly claim, go on to join the pantheon of dystopian futuristic movies that will continue to be discussed even fifty years hence. Two thumbs up.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Good Idea Run Wild,"There are some good ideas in this movie, but it is too long, and the longer it goes on, the more grotesque it gets. The ending is ambiguous and ultimately a cop-out. It becomes a hard movie to watch.The first half of the film, which is mostly set in the hotel, is interesting. The idea of people being threatened, coerced and coached to fall in love is only one step beyond the real world insanity of speed-dating and other atrocities. The film seems to be mocking society's conformism with black humor.In the second half of the film, the story gets confused and more frightening. It involves a tribe of single people who are just as vicious as the hotel staff, perhaps more so. A romance develops that appears to challenge the abusive tribe's leader's authority, but in the end, it's not clear whether the main characters have truly risen above their circumstances. I found this depressing and wasn't sure what the message was supposed to be.Something else I didn't like about this film is that there are two female characters who are completely evil, whereas the men are mostly bumbling along. I found the film to be slightly misogynistic.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Creative Stepping Stone for a Brilliant Director,"Yorgos Lanthimos' The Lobster opens spectacularly, inviting your imagination to explore the grand dystopian future it presents. It proceeds to dole out sharp commentary on society's pressure to find and maintain a relationship at any cost, even by introducing a child to the dysfunction. However, all this goes to waste as The Lobster overstays its welcome. Without much more to say, the film drags along, promising a grand revelation in its finale. Alas, the final scene was telegraphed long ago to anyone paying attention, and lingers in the air like rotting shellfish.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not my cup of tea...,"I give this movie a ""I'd watch it for free if I was super bored"" out of 10. (3/10)First off, this was definitely not a movie I would watch again. Just to clarify. I only watched it because someone I care about loves it and I wanted to like it for his sake, but I just couldn't.If I could overlook the plot and the way I felt about it, I might say its a good movie. Costumes and set design is nice to look at and all, but I couldn't get over how uncomfortable this entire movie made me.The concept is interesting... single people have a certain amount of time to find a suitable partner with whom they have something in common, or else they get turned into an animal of their choosing. I just didn't like the way the story played out or the style of acting. Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz (and every other actor within) play characters who have zero social skills and I just didnt vibe with it, if I'm being honest.It's not a bad movie.

One of a kind movie about love (mandatory or prohibited),"""The Lobster"" (2015 release from Europe; 118 min.) opens with a bang, literally. In the pre-opening credit scene, we see a woman getting out of her car, running into the field, and shooting a donkey (spurring gasps from the theater audience, more on that later). After the opening credits, we get to know David, whose wife has just left him. David is taken to a hotel where he now has 45 days to find a new mate or be transformed into an animal. If it gets that far, he chooses to be a lobster (""because they live to be a hundred, have blue blood in them, and are fertile their entire life""). ""Excellent choice"" responds the hotel manager, adding ""most people choose to be a dog, that's why you see dogs everywhere"". Will David find a mate? Or will he become a lobster? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Greek writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos, who previously gave us the brilliant ""Dogtooth"". This is his debut English language film. Here he brings us a completely original, truly one-of-a-kind, story about love, be it mandatory love (first half of the movie), or prohibited love (second half of the movie). The movie feels strangely dispassionate yet engaging, in particular in the last 45 minutes. Colin Farrell brings the performance of a lifetime as David, your average ""Joe Six Pack"", slight beer belly and all. Even though Rachel Weisz gets second-to-top billing, she doesn't appear until the second half of the movie, but when she finally does, she blows everyone away as ""Short Sighted Woman"". There are many other choice performances, though: check out French actress Léa Seydoux as the ruthless leader of the ""loners"", always on the lookout to detect (and punish--""red kiss"" anyone?) any flirting between the loners. In the opening credits, all the different co-producers seemingly amount to a mini-European Union summit, as LOTS of European countries co-financed this movie. It's almost amazing to me that such an original and let's face it, very unconventional idea was able to garner the necessary financing or was able to convince first rate stars like Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz to sign on to this. But the main thing is that Lanthimos made it happen somehow.""The Lobster"" made a huge splash at the 2015 Cannes film festival. No idea why it's taken another full year to find its way onto the screen here in the US but better late than never I suppose. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay, but just okay (about 10-12 people). After the initial gasps, the audience settled in and laughed at all the right times. I can't see this playing in theaters a very long time, the movie is too ""weird"" and off-center for that. I happen to think it's one of the most original movies about love I've seen in a very, very long time, and would readily suggest that you check this out, be it in theaters, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""The Lobster"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A dazzling piece of cinema,"One of the most idiosyncratic, ambitious films I've seen this decade. A lot may not take to it and that's fine, but it worked so well for me. It took a bit to really get lost in its world and in its aims, but once I did it worked so beautifully. Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, and Lea Seydoux are fantastic, with Farrell especially having a great year between this and his performance in True Detective (easily the best thing about it). I really wish it was technically a 2015 release so I could include it in my line-ups, but alas it will so far be the king of 2016. Overall, definitely such a strong and original, distinctive piece in filmmaking, but surely not one everyone will take to. But it's worth giving it a shot.",,Anonymous,Romance
Sooo boring!,"All I understood from this film is that I should have done what Colin Farrell's character does at the very end of the movie. Because it was sooo boring! And so hard to watch!It has a very artsy feel, but it doesn't say much. I thought that if it's full of big stars like; Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Olivia Colman, John C. Reilly, Jessica Barden or Lea Seydoux it's going to be fun, entertaining and deep like a Ingmar Bergman movie, but boy, was I wrong!I really don't understand why every character speaks and acts just like a robot. It's like none of them have emotions. And this lack of emotions from the characters makes me emotionless too and then it becomes so hard to relate to what I see on screen.It's all just pretentious mambo-jumbo!

A biting social commentary that is not for all tastes,"Finally got around to watching Yorgos Lanthimos' black comedy ""The Lobster"" (2015) starring Colin Farrell, Olivia Colman, John C. Reilly, Ben Whishaw, and Rachel Weisz. For those of you unfamiliar with it, Farrell plays a downtrodden man whose wife has left him for another man. Set in a dystopian future where unattached people are forced into a hotel where they have to find a new mate within 45 days or be turned into animal of their choosing. Farrell has chosen a lobster - hence the title! It is a bizarre but biting social commentary (especially the first half), I don't want to spoil anything but there were laugh out lines for me (but maybe my sense of humor is dryer than yours). Farrell does an excellent job playing a man who is remarkably non-self aware - IMHO, it is one of his best performances. The rest of the cast are excellent as well: John C. Reilly and Ben Whishaw are men Farrell befriends at the hotel, Olivia Colman is the unctuous hotel manager, and Rachel Weisz is a woman who narrates (and appears later). While not for all tastes, I recommend you watch it and make up your own mind - some people hated it - I did not. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the most bizarre films of recent years is an odd joy to behold,"If you're chasing your movie meal to be served up well and truly above medium strange with an added dollop of weird sauce and odd and odder sides, then my goodness is Yorgos Lanthimos's The Lobster the feast you've been seeking.One of the most downright bizarre yet somehow never less than engaging experiences of recent times, The Lobster takes the viewer into a darkly comically alternative existence where humans are to be matched with partners in hotel matchmaking or face the prospect of being turned into an animal of their choice and if you think that synopsis sounds cuckoo wait until you witness the final product.Playing it deadpan and never once letting up on its game of oddities, The Lobster sees a game and capable cast play out numerously amusing scenarios from hunting other humans in the woods with tranquiliser guns, partaking in creepy hotel dances or having hands be placed in toasters, Lanthimos isn't afraid to put his named cast through the wringer and many actors are the best they've been in years.The comedic talents of actors like Colin Farrell and John C. Reilly (here sporting a lisp) are well known and the two gentleman acquit themselves well with equally thankless roles but Lanthimos also finds gold out of performers like Ben Whishaw, Rachel Weisz and Olivia Colman in roles that require them to remain straight faced even though what they're getting up to is anything but ""normal"". Especially there are particular joys and amusements to be found early on here as we're introduced to each of these abnormal characters and as we get thrown into this bizarre world you can't help but laugh no matter how dark things are actually getting and how little you actually understand about what on earth is going on.For fans of Charlie Kaufman and even select Wes Anderson films, The Lobster will likely become a new favourite and will quite possibly be a beloved cult classic as the years draw on from its discoveries on home video formats and while Lanthimos's film loses some steam from a midway point shift in focus, The Lobster is about as original and often hilarious a film as you're likely to get in today's movie climate.3 ½ misused toasters out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a movie!,"The Lobster is a surreal deadpan comedy about the strangeness of social pressures and modern relationships.The setting is a bleak, tightly controlled hotel on the coast of Ireland. David (Colin Farrell), a recently divorced Architect, is given 40 days to find a partner or else be transformed into an animal of his choosing; in this case, a lobster. Sound strange? That's just the first 10 minutes. Guests of the hotel are subjected to routine trips to shoot 'loners' with tranquillisers, and awkward high-school dances to entice singles to mingle. As David's days start running out, he decides to feign common interest with a heartless woman in order to escape his fate. But can he pull it off?Farrell really hits the mark with this role, displaying awkward machismo and fragile humility in equal measure. His comedic timing is matched only by his supporting cast that includes John C. Reilly, Ashley Jensen, and Olivia Coleman. Rachel Weisz is also spot-on as the short-sighted woman.This is a movie following the best tradition of the Hellenistic tragicomedies combined with the uniquely modern peer pressure of the society and complicated rules of the relationships in the near future.

"I like a film that makes you think, but...","There's certainly food for thought in this bizarre film. A dystopian present (not future, as some suggest), in which being solitary is a crime punishable by death (or being turned into an animal, as citizens are led to believe). Why? People are celebrated for coupling, even though their relationship is based on superficial commonalities like bleeding noses or short-sightedness. Why? Those who rebel and seek salvation through being solitary are punished when they seek connection with someone else. Why? There are no clues to the answers to these questions.

Awful movie with great actors and pointless,One of the top ten 2015 IMDb movies and its just plain awful. I never write reviews but I was shocked the caliber of actors involved in this movie and what bad roles they accepted. This reminded me of a society of mental handicapped people with no emotions or expressions trying to function and its just not amusing at all and 2 dimensional. How was this a comedy in anyway did I miss the jokes? I'm shocked the actors read this script and thought it was a good idea even for a futuristic indie art house movie. I wish the actors had to payback people's money and 2 hours of their life they would rethink garbage like this. Movies like this are when actors are starting to jump the shark and going nowhere fast. Movies like ex machina are movies worth praise not this dull dribble of a movie. In response as to how this was some kind of statement of society and relationships in what way? All people look for companionship and to trivialize people struggles to connect with one another and find love to a simplistic moronic view really insults the viewer and life in general.

Single white male,"Last year, in Amsterdam a pop-up restaurant for singles opened its doors.I was a huge success, and the tables-for-one were filled every night. I imagine it must have looked a bit like the breakfast room in the hotel where 'The Lobster' is set. Only singles, sitting next to each other, facing the large windows and enjoying the view.'The Lobster' is a highly imaginative and original film about the way our society handles people without a partner. In the film, they are forced to find a suitable partner or they will be turned into an animal (the lead character's choice is a lobster, hence the title). But in the forests around the hotel live the loners who are just as strict, but the other way around: they refuse to find a partner, and forbid other loners to find one.The film is satirical, sometimes funny, cruel at times, often disturbing, and overall very weird. But I was less impressed by it than I was by Dogtooth, director Lanthimos's previous acclaimed film. Dogtooth was creepier and more disturbing, although it wasn't so outspoken about modern society and its issues.'The Lobster' is not an straightforward run-of-the-mill movie.

the odd couple,"I've often felt recently that society is slowly pushing single men to the fringes. But this unusual art house stylised film, populated by actors who are usually very mainstream, takes that idea to the extreme.There are similarities with Being John Malkovich in sheer weirdness of the conceit, but there is also a strong feeling, mirrored by the jagged music that this is a film that wants to join the indie crowd, but wasn't born to it. This is made by someone who loves Jonze, Anderson, Gondry, Iñárritu etc - but like Gilliam hasn't quite mastered getting a great treatment to a strong draft.The problem first comes with the tone, which is played differently throughout the cast. Olivia Colman's Hotel Manager strikes an almost perfect absurdest humour, but then Ben Wishaw plays it almost totally straight. Farrell keeps to a low key with some nice notes of humour but doesn't really fill the screen. There are moments of embarrassing terror, and these leave the audience a bit perplexed next to lighter touches.And then the film just has pacing problems and feels longer than it should do.

The Lobster - Movie Review,"Loner Leader: ""We dance alone. That's why we only play electronic music"".The Lobster takes place in a dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods.The Lobster is a film that's both strange and completely bizarre, but rather brilliant as well. It's one of those movies that's so different with it's story and visuals that it's quite intriguing to watch. The cinematography was tremendous and the movie isn't predicable, as many times it takes a different turn for the best. Yorgos Lanthimos knows what he's doing and I can tell what he was going for when it came to the self aware moments. Every choice Lanthimos made in this movie when it came to the acting was done on purpose, as it fitted well in this unusual world that these people lived in.

"While certainly bold and original, the second half struggles with the more serious emotions","The Lobster is a completely absurdist societal commentary on society's emphasis on monogamy and relationships. The first half's humor and exploration of Lanthimos' wildly creative premise is the movie's strength. The functioning of the hotel and how they encourage people to find partners as well as the animal aspect was amusing. The intentional lack of emotion and engagement with others was frustrating to watch - while I appreciate the symbolic nature of it, it took me out of the premise in which partnership was everything because it felt so unrealistic for them to act with no emotion. The second half also didn't feel strong and was less clever and active in plot. A point made repeatedly in the movie was how heavily relationships are based on shared interests or similarities, which just didn't ring very true or relevant to me. Farrell was good, and one of my favorite elements of the film (and a big reason why it's still an overall positive review) was the score - it was dramatic but simple and fit to the scenes very well. The boldness of ideas and themes were fun, but some of the relationship themes didn't quite land with me, and the second half and especially ending were disappointing, especially given the potential of the technical aspects and premise.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
accepting the anomalies should be the new normal,"Eccentric Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos' fifth feature, four years after ALPS (2011), is an Ireland-based multi-national English-speaking production starring Colin Farrell as David, a misfit in a dystopian society aka. the City where couples are the norm and all single people are given a 45- day stint to stay in The Hotel and find a partner, otherwise they will be transformed into an animal. David's wife has passed away recently and lobster is the animal he chooses to be if he fails the mission, which instantly reminds me the reference of the claw-holding lobsters in FRIENDS, it is the symbol of true love, but here David gives away his own reasons: blue-blood, longevity, fertility and his love of ocean, yet we should also know, lobsters are blind.Farrell undergoes a formidable physical transmogrification into a portly middle-aged architect, and is stripped off any celebrity glamour with his bookish semblance and unwieldy awkwardness, in the hotel, he meets two single fellows, a lisping man (Reilly), a limping man (Whishaw), and tries to woo a nosebleed woman (Barden) while refuses the courtship from the biscuit woman (Jensen), as he confesses, pretending to have a feeling for someone whom you don't is the hardest. Meanwhile all the singles in the hotel are regularly organised to hunt for loners - those single people who rebels against the City and live in the woods. For catching a loner, their stint will be extended for one day, but David is not very good at it, the deadline is pressing, he concedes to his proclivity for short- haired woman and chooses a heartless woman (a steely Papoulia) as the last resort, who is the record-holder of the loner-hunting and has no urgency to end up her single status. It is a terrible mistake, eventually David sneaks out of the hotel and plunges into the wood, becomes a loner himself, which brings the film into the second half, the world of loners.Loners lead by a French woman (Seydoux), they conform to the doctrine where no relationships are allowed among loners, they cannot have sex, cannot dance together, even flirting will be punished by ""red kiss"", it is the exact the other side of the coin from the City, however, David again, is a misfit here, since he falls for a short-sighted loner (Weisz), David is myopic too, their romance develops steadily, they even invent a set of body language only can be understood by themselves, to communicate with each other without being too intimate in front of others, a make-up free Weisz elicits a memorable presence radiant of earnestness and compassion. But the leader finds it out eventually, and deprives the woman of myopia. And then the two decide to flee together and enter the City as a couple, with one big decision for David to take, to test how strong their love is, and after a suspicious long-take, the film ends without revealing what has happened to David, and what's next for the star-crossed lovers.In spite of the outré setting of the story, unlike the elusive ALPS, the film puts forth a quite comprehensible narrative arc which channelled by a woman's voice-over (later viewers would know it is from the short-sighted woman's journal), and leaves audience hooked in the idiosyncrasy of the concept and the exigency of David (and his lover)'s plight. Relying on dramatic classical pieces, including a smart exploitation of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' WHERE THE WILD ROSES GROW hummed ominously by David; contrasting landscape and scenes of hotel and wood, outskirt and city; highly stylish camera-work from Thimios Bakatakis (slo-motions and long-takes are put into action during crucial moments), Lanthimos' metaphysical methodology of exposing the deep- rooted alienation among human individuals ends up with an impressive high note with THE LOBSTER, it is a slap-in-the-face ridicule about rigid conformism, whether being single or staying as a couple, accepting the anomalies should be the new normal.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I am no genius but I couldn't divine from the content how humanity had gotten to this point and I hope that it never does. I don't know if it is a alternate reality or different dimension. If it was supposed to be futuristic it isn't very distant as all of the vehicles in the city scenes were cars that are currently used with only slight modifications to look futuristic. The only redeeming value was a competent and respected cast, who I would have never dreamed would have participated in such a mess, which is what duped me into watching this from the get go.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Utterly bizarre but strangely enchanting,"Is it just me or does this feel like its premise was thought up down the pub and then drunkenly yelled at two sober top notch writers?Is it bad that I literally watched this because I saw the name and between all the ""Look....Superheroes!"" and ""Adam Sandler the movie"" films, I saw it was simply called... The Lobster. Now I don't know why that name attracted me, it's probably something I should tell my therapist, but yeah, I watched it.From the onset you are dropped into this strangely haunting world, only led by the steady yet uncomfortable voice of the protagonist. Had to double check Colin Firth was involved with this as it struck me as quite an indie sort of film for him but that's probably my miscalculation. I'll be straight with you and say that it isn't non stop intense viewing that you will feel changed after. It has dips and troughs as a film and at some times you will find yourself on the edge of your seat and sometimes you will find yourself on your phone, but it is definitely a fascinating world and story and it might raise a bunch of questions for you.

The Lobster analogy,"As when we read Shirley Jackson's the Lottery or Animal Farm, we are taken to another reality with The Lobster. If our reality is that we must be in a relationship and the only relationship allowable is one where we have something in common with our significant other, then the rules of our society will reflect that certainty. If we are in opposition to that and are members of the underground fighting this reality then the opposite is true. There should be no relationships and the authority will discourage that. The reactions of the characters to different life situations reflects those certainties and their solutions to problems confirms their opposite dogmas. Spoilers hereafter. When the main character's brother (now a dog) is killed by his fiancé, her actions are logical in this new reality we are visiting. She must have someone with whom she has something in common. He has said he is heartless, so she tests him with the killing of the dog. The certainty that he must be heartless makes her test logical. On the other hand, those who have taken the opposite view must blind the girl who needs a near sighted mate. It's fun to go back to high school with a Lord of the Flies analysis. So, if this was an interesting challenge for you, it might just be that the Lobster will be your cup of tea.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Uncomfortable due to its coldness, ""The Lobster"" is invariably permeated by a melancholic irony, especially when it comes to the portrayal of relationships","Written by Lanthimos alongside his usual partner Efthymis Filippou, the script takes place in a dystopian world in which single people are forced to stay in a huge resort, having 45 days to find new partners, being transformed into an animal of their choice. If they can't. (Yes, you read that correctly.) It is in this situation that the sad David (Colin Farrell) finds himself, who, exchanged for his wife, arrives at the hotel where he meets the Man with the Tied Tongue (John C. Reilly) and the Lame Man (Ben Whishasw), who, in turn, try to evaluate their chances with the Woman with a Bleeding Nose (Jessica Barden), the Cookie Woman (Jensen) or even the Heartless Woman (Papoulia).As you can see from the ""names"" of the characters, ""The Lobster"" takes on a fable-like tone from the beginning, highlighting it through the narration that, appearing in the voice of Rachel Weisz, is even responsible for describing actions that we are already seeing on the screen and the protagonist's feelings. But this repetition, in no way, acts against the narrative of the work, it only guarantees its acidic humor in a poignant way. The care of the director and screenwriter, together with Efthymis Filippou, is the way in which this narration is inserted into the plot, therefore justifying itself and giving indications of what was to come, being one of the main causes of tension in the audience. One of the curious elements of the project, in fact, is realizing how the nature of this narrator is gradually revealed, allowing us to gradually understand her exact interest and role in the story she tells the viewer.Intriguing by paying attention to the smallest details of the universe it conceives, the film enriches the narrative by explaining how hotel guests can earn more days (hunting rebels called Loners), by acting out lessons designed to highlight how important it is to have a partner and by demonstrating how employees excite customers just so they have greater motivation to find a mate. Furthermore, Lanthimos obviously has fun creating scenes like those that feature everyone wearing identical clothes or explaining their ""marking"" characteristics to others. In these moments, the director's absurd sense of humor constantly surprises the audience - and the dry justification for adopting children as a way of resolving marital conflicts is just one of several examples of excellent jokes that still function as an acidic commentary on the dysfunctional nature of of so many relationships. Furthermore, ""The Lobster"" features Colin Farrell in a great performance, as he is responsible for making the audience laugh just with his expressions of confusion or even pain when having to choose to identify himself as ""straight"" or ""hom*sexual"" and when strive to simulate compatibility that does not exist with potential partners.It is no surprise that the characters are defined by some of their physical characteristics; in that universe, individuals are constantly reduced to a single element of their physique or personality - which, let's face it, is not that different from the way we often judge and are judged in our daily lives (and it is no surprise that one of the first questions we ask when meeting someone is ""What do you do?"", as if this were the easiest way to understand the type of person we have in front of us). Furthermore, the imperative need to have a partner is certainly something that is echoed in the real world, as well as a certain tendency to discard certain romantic possibilities because we think we ""deserve more"" - and it is enough to see how many of those seen in ""The Lobster"" prefer the fate of animals (since at least they will be able to find a new partner of the same species) than an involvement with someone who is not completely ""compatible"". It is only natural, therefore, that practically all the characters in the film communicate with a mechanical and lifeless intonation, since authentic feeling and impulsiveness seem to have been lost in that universe.""The Lobster"" is invariably permeated by a melancholic irony, especially when it comes to the portrayal of relationships. The story is narrated by a mysterious female voice. We only met her owner later on. David spends his days trying to find his next soulmate, but he is unable to hide the exhaustion, including psychological, resulting from this movement. In a given circumstance, he decides to approach the woman who everyone thinks has no feelings. To this end, he begins to pretend to be devoid of emotions. In this strange dynamic that brings together suitors, success is strictly linked to similarities, that is, the combination of a series of characteristics is necessary for things to ""work out"". Lanthimos fiercely addresses the mechanisms that make emotional connections possible, highlighting, for example, certain conventions and preconceptions, thereby carrying the narrative of a latent disillusionment. Although allegorical, it sadly borders on reality.The society seen here does not tolerate the middle ground, it is extremist. This can be seen from check-in at the hotel, a moment in which it is not permitted to opt for bisexuality, to the exact size of the protagonist's shoes, and finally, which is most important to expose the whole, to the behavior of the single rebels who live in the forest. Before being an environment free of rules, the refuge is also a space of impositions. On the one hand, according to official regulations, no one can live alone, on the other, that is, according to dissidents who defend the opposite, it is inconceivable to fall in love and create romantic bonds. David finds himself trapped, with no prospect of freeing himself. His discretion extends only to the choice of one of the philosophies to follow. All possibilities of the neglected path are categorically denied to him. In any niche, people are oppressed and emotionally repressed, restricted by moral and ethical codes of immutable clauses. The leader of the revolt, played by Léa Seydoux, is as despotic in her fight against the current system as those responsible for the closure and subsequent metamorphosis of the failures. Yorgos Lanthimos gives strong contours to the violence that slaughters apparently dull characters, resigned to the developments, however cruel and senseless they are understood as side effects of the current times. Questions, insurrections and attempts to move on the sidelines are stifled, regardless of the methods necessary. In this regard, David and the shortsighted woman played by Rachel Weisz try hard to find a solution. The ending perpetuates the bitterness, mainly because the Greek filmmaker, contrasting symbolism and eccentricities with the dry record of effervescent desires, creates a film that says a lot about the current cultivation of ephemerality and the seizure, also in force, of the capacity for dialogue due to intolerance.The two most interesting elements of The Lobster are the reductionism used to define its characters and the actions responsible for their construction. We often meet characters notorious for their poor physical attributes, and it is very symbolic that they always look for someone with the same defects. Even more interesting is to note how some individuals subject themselves to constant self-flagellation to match some characteristic of a potential partner, with the sole intention of appearing to be the ideal match for that person. The performances, deliberately devoid of emotion or any nuance, are perfect in building a world deprived of feelings and individualism.But it is in the direction and photography that we find those most responsible for the coldness of the dystopian world of ""The Lobster"". Enhancing the robotic performances, there are the cold colors and framing that constantly throw characters to the corners of the shots and always leave the camera far from all the people present in the scene, leaving the viewer distant from the world presented. Practically all of the film's dialogues are constructed using medium shots and sets, never using close-ups and rarely using close-ups. The latter only start to be used when David starts to rebel against the system and tries to follow his own path.Despite having enormous importance in the narrative as it is essential to the message conveyed by the film, the change of environment present in the second half of the work brings a strong break in rhythm, which is recovered later on by David's approach to Rachel Weisz's character. Even so, there are memorable moments, such as when, for the first time, we see characters showing some passion, precisely when they hear a duo playing an emotional and strong song on their guitars. The soundtrack, based on dense and simple string arrangements, taken from existing works and worthy of good psychological horror, is worth highlighting in ""The Lobster"", which are repeated and are essential for the aseptic tone of the narrative, as they are very present precisely in the moments that could bring some experience to the film. Like any good dystopia, the work may appear to be so, but it is not so far from our society. Stating that even those dissatisfied with their realities subject themselves to it in search of acceptance, the film is uncomfortable due to its coldness, but extremely competent due to the clarity of its message. The moments of dark humor soften the weight of the analysis brought, but more than just light laughs, they establish a discomfort that provides precisely what Yorgos Lanthimos wants with ""The Lobster"": to make the audience think. Making us reflect and review how we behave and accept ourselves.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Hilarious, Strange and Very Creative","Very few films really entertain me, but The Lobster delivered so many unexpected laughs. My guess would be that you will enjoy this film if you march to your own tune. The film pokes fun at many of a structured society's rules, systems and expectations. The deadpan delivery was a nice surprise. It was almost as if the actors were acting like the public who are often a bit too rigid and dry for my taste. It is impressive that such a film attracted such a wide range of talented actors. I have to admit that I laughed out loud at several ""inappropriate"" moments. Colin Farrell seemed to be really stretching himself in this role. His performance delighted me as much as when Brad Pitt plays gritty crazy characters in Kalifonia or 12 Monkeys. The reason I appreciate such roles is that they appear, to me, to push an actor's ability to play something quite different than the majority of the roles they are cast in. To me, this demonstrates a higher level of ability. Although the film as a whole was dark and unusual, it certainly held my interest, got me thinking and provided several bursts of laughter. Well done to all who contributed the the creation of this work. You can be sure you have made great art when it evokes such a strong response from the audience.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

They need to not read straight off the cue cards. Maybe that was their vision I don't know, but it seemed to drag the movie down. It wasn't like that for the whole movie and definitely not all the characters. But for a few it was very odd and made the movie seem like it had poor acting. I will say one thing, this movie was definitely more interesting and a better use of film and budget than the revenant. I would watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Holds up a mirror and lets us see our reflection,"The premise of Yorgos Lanthimos' latest absurdist film (or should we simply say ""absurd"") The Lobster is that those who are unmarried have forty five days to choose a mate or are turned into animals. This is something my mother might have said but even she would have offered the possibility of clemency. Co-written by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou, the film continues the same style as Dogtooth with wooden characters that are tight-lipped, undeveloped emotionally and uncertain about how to handle their desire for companionship. Like those in Charlie Kaufman's animated satire Anomalisa, everyone has the same robotic presence, perhaps a commentary on the way people relate to each other these days.The film stars Colin Farrell as David, a dumpy-looking middle aged man whose wife thought better of their relationship and split. In the world he finds himself in, hopefully sometime far in the future or on another planet, it is against the law to be single, though we don't learn whether it is a felony or a misdemeanor. In any event, David is checked into a hotel with other unfortunates who must choose to register as either hetero or homosexual and must decide on the kind of animal they would like to become if they cannot find a match. It is a serviceable place to spend one's last days as a human, but it is not the Grand Budapest.Unlike most who choose to become a dog, David wants to be a lobster because they live one hundred years and remain fertile, though that's really not an asset when you are thrown into boiling hot water, but I guess if you like water, why not? The people are friendly sorts but are not big on warmth or caring. The hotel manager (Olivia Coleman) and her husband (Garry Mountaine) are likable enough as is the maid (Ariane Labed) but David hits it off mostly with two hotel guests, ""the limping man"" (Ben Whishaw) and ""the lisping man"" (John C. Reilly). The drive is to find a match, someone who shares the same physical characteristics with you, such as a bloody nose or a hatred for other people such as one known as ""The Heartless Woman"" (Angeliki Papoulia). She's a real sweetheart.Naturally, you may have to work at being heartless to gain her approval, though many people already have considerable experience. Aside from Las Vegas type galas with the manager and her husband providing the entertainment, the only approved playtime activity is to go hunting in the nearby forest to subdue and capture those poor souls designated as the ""Loners."" These are the dreaded single people, those without a partner that they can spend their lives fighting with. Neither the Loners nor the hotel hotties are big on sex but talking to each other is okay, at least if you don't call for a political revolution which seems to be in the air these days. Since masturbation is frowned upon and is rewarded by having your hands stuck in a toaster, there is little else to do but talk.To the ominous strains of an original score by Johnnie Burn, David finally says enough is enough with this rot and escapes into the woods where he joins up with the Loners but finds out that they have rules which are just as rigid. Guided by their uptight leader (Lea Seydoux), who is so cold that butter wouldn't melt in her mouth, they go to the opposite extreme, prohibiting any attempt at a love relationship. When David meets Rachel Weisz, however, the first sign of something positive emerges but their forbidden relationship takes the film into even more difficult and disturbing territory, not recommended for small children.Lanthimos' first English-language film evokes strong reactions from viewers by simply holding up a mirror and letting us see our reflection or, perhaps even more disturbing, sense the direction in which we are headed. It is not a pretty sight and The Lobster is not a pleasant experience unless you are a blind man looking in a dark room for a black cat that isn't there. While ""dystopian"" films such as this can be looked upon as a warning or cautionary tale, the question must be asked whether, in relentlessly envisioning the future as taking place in a bleak and lifeless world, they might actually be helping to create it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Missed Opportunity,"Collin Farrell knows exactly how to deliver his lines (with a satisfying native Irish accent) in The Lobster. Writer/Director Ygoros Lanthimos must've been giddy behind the camera, as his world of strangeness and deadpan humor was captured. A very promising future is set for the both of them. (See: The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Also see: my coming critique.)It's very refreshing to get a tone of weird, absurdest humor out of otherwise dull language. The way he writes his dialogue in repetitive, robotic flow makes for an intriguing study of the human condition.This is the movie's strongest aspect. Unfortunately, it becomes exhaustive and stretched well passed its welcoming universe.About the halfway mark, we leave the setting that promised obscure and terrifying things to take place, and instead the writer seems to go out of his way to make a more structured message on love. You will find such a message, but it's beaten and kicked to death, leaving the viewer a bit insulted that no confidence was held in him earlier to find it himself.Strange and uncomfortable movies are what I get most revved up about and this certainly had that charm, albeit for a shorter time than its 2 hour running. What really upsets me and irks is the useless interfacing between pointless characters
and a reaching climax that rehashes themes attempting to really hone in the message.In my opinion, Farrel, the dark hotel of lonliness and the animal conversion machine could have been cultivated toward a truly shocking 
twist and utter devastation that would have shaken the audience.Instead, its interesting rhythm fizzles, and we're left with what feels like a pretentious artist sticking with the flat-line tone he should have shed in the second act.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

He goes with his 'brother' to a hotel, where a mate must be found in 45 days or they are turned into animals, but they have a choice of what animal to be. David, at reception states he wants to become a lobster and why. The person said that was a change, since many simply say into a dog, hence his 'brother'. There are contests (a hunt) and any professing of becoming a couple are under strict supervision to make sure there are no tricks. There are scenes in the woods, where there are many very different animals from what one would think of being in the woods, so obviously they represent the 'failures'. There is an incentive to find a mate, as singles (known as lonelys) are not permitted in this society. To say this is a very unusual movie understates it greatly.

"While it is well made and acted, the disconnect & incompleteness of the primary premise didn't allow me indulge into its absurdity","Sometimes the premise can just be weird, but nothing that I have ever seen is so lack of sense, purpose or necessity. Having said that, the clarity, vision, ambition for this non-sensical concept has to be appreciated along with a committed performance from its top stars.In a future world where single people are taken to the 'Hotel' and given 45 days to find a suitable partner failing which they will be converted into an animal of their choice and sent off to the 'Woods'. David (Colin Farrell) has lost his wife recently after which he was moved to the 'Hotel'. Customary to the on-boarding process, the Guest has to decide which animal they would like to transform to in case they couldn't find a partner and David choose a 'Lobster'.Colin Farrell was on the path to become an action superstar when he started his career with back to back box office hits until it got derailed spectacularly with Alexander. He is a terrifically talented actor and the duds allowed him to associate with movies of different genres without the necessity to alter scripts for mass appeal. 'The Lobster' is one such movie which is so offbeat, independent and full of experimentation.The entire movie making process was structured, well edited, smartly produced and aptly cast. However the constant voice over to explain the proceedings shows a weak screenplay and the lack of purpose or necessity of the primary premise left me disconnected occasionally. There is also a rebellious group who fight to stay single (again without a purpose or a backstory) which again leaves you wondering about the motivation for any of their actions. The rebel leader's actions and why anyone would follow her also leaves you with more questions. Most of the unanswered questions doesn't feel like a meta narrative that lets the audience decide for themselves but as just incomplete.While it is well made and acted, the disconnect & incompleteness of the primary premise didn't allow me indulge into its absurdity.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolute Gem,"I love love love this movie and honestly cannot get the bad reviews. Ok it is unusual BUT...it is unique, actors are great, music too, cinematography and top concept altogether.I love the fact that it depicts the two extremes as equally fascist and cruel because they certainly can be.It is of course an idea but it amazes me how many people got offended by the movie.What about tinder? Aren't people hungry to connect based on absurd, superficial nonsense? The idea that we need to find someone or just anyone just to make it though. Again, aren't couples forces to stay together either by societal pressures or because they cannot stay alone for a brief moment?On the other hand, being alone on a deep level is cruel. It is cruel to die alone, it is cruel not to have someone to just rub your back when you are in need. Amd aren't some dogmatic people from each side judging the rest? People who differentiate from them. Being judgmental to the point of being unempathic, unaccepting and cruel.

I would suggest you go and see the original metaphor of Duchamp's urinal; indeed this film is what you put in aforementioned cultural artefact.Indeed any cultural import this digital decadence may tenuously have is that it itself is symptomatic of a nihilistic post-modern anomie, the lost world of the religiosity of the self, where just because you have idea everyone must be burdened by it. In the words of chairman Mao ""just because you break wind, doesn't mean I have to sniff it""This facile confused dystopian narrative can only be compared to some over-indulgent self-absorbed up its own solipsistic end of year Art Show; if Tracy Emmmin made movies even she wouldn't make this. Well maybe?Be warned even watching a Benny Cumberbatch period drama wont clear out the detritus of this movie from your psyche as your fatigued mind tries to piece this nonsense together for the ""cult"" director. In fact I'd rather join a cult and deal with that psychological fall-out than the trite banalities I was subjected to in the dark by this nonsense.Even the sound track on its own drives you to distraction and in all likelihood to a migraine. The violence of the film is random and brutal; which was ironic as I chose it instead of going to the latest Bond romp because I was not in the mood for stylised violence. Believe me that was the only irony I experienced during this filmI confess the only reasons I stuck it out was that I am a tight fisted Scotsman who will get his money's worth, even if that is just sitting in a warm cinema; that it was an art house cinema and I figured that sometimes you have to suffer for that kind of indulgence and lastly I had a forlorn hope that there might be a disclaimer at the end apologising for the waste of my life and high jacking my psyche and that I might be able to claim some kind of refund on the grounds of diminished responsibility in the face of directorial indulgence, at least that would have been the decent thing, cause I sure as hell would not have done this to him.My worry though dear reader is, you read this review and it might encourage the curious to go see. That is what the so-called premise of the film did to me; believe me it doesn't even hold it own.If you have to see this movie then treat it like you are going to see a brutal car accident in slow motion that will require to be enacted in your head accompanied by a relentless jarring sound track forever!Or you can save yourself the sheer monotonous pain and let me take the bullet for you.On a lighter note the film is so bad that the ridiculous stultifying dialogue and direction actually make Colin Farrell look like he is actually acting, so good type casting there!Now if you think I have been indulgent you haven't seen this, whatever this is?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Film Noir Light,"Not for the folks who need movies spoon-fed to them. The jock/cheerleader types will find it dull.
But if you like your film noir a bit more easy to digest (like me) this flick will keep your brain occupied for days.
Collin Farrell is almost unnocitable. It may be his best work.
There are no amazing sets, no spectacular scenery, no stand out performances.
Everyone and every thing is swallowed by the story entirely.
The dialogue is uneasy, terse, and blunt.
All the while there is a sense of unease, awkwardness, and stifled tension.

A surrealist observation of marriage and love,"What a strange, grim movie. Yet it was surprisingly enjoyable. Let's go over the surrealist aspects of the film first: if you're the type of person who wants logical explanations, realistic premises, or any kind of closure in a film, then this is not for you. The Lobster is relentlessly absurd, and it demands a lot more out of its viewers than most other movies.I love this kind of weirdness. Yes, the themes of this movie could have been explored in a more realistic and comprehensible manner. But we have so many of those already. I'm glad these kinds of movies can also exist.So is the message of this film about love? Kind of. It's more about the institution of love. We have no federally enforced love laws, but societal pressures can sometimes be just as powerful. Anyone who's been single for a long stretch of time, especially over a certain age, probably knows how weird and absurd people can be about relationships. How people get annoyingly nosy and how they assume things about single people. How desperate some singles can get. The Lobster is about all this garbage our culture puts on us regarding love and marriage. So yes, it's about love, but not at all a romantic movie.In fact, the bleary performances of the actors brought it down a few points below what I initially wanted to give it. I understand why they were directed like that. The Lobster's dystopia is full of people whose lives completely revolve around staying in these state-mandated relationships. These people are constantly miserable but don't even know it. While this was amusing in the first hour or so, it slowly started to falter as the movie stretched for another hour. I think some more cutting or performance adjusting would've done it good. As the humor faded toward the end, the nightmarish qualities of the movie got a little too real. Too bad ""Deadpan horror"" doesn't work as well as ""deadpan humor.""",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Another peculiar dystopian tale set in the future.,"From the director of the Oscars nominated movie 'Dogtooth'. If you are familiar with his signature movie, you will find it so good. This is not the best movie I had seen that set in the future, but like any other it was another dystopian tale. A black comedy-romance with a decent storyline, performances and overall a nice entertainer.The pace was very depressing, but I kept hooked to it for its frequent unpredictable scenes. The first act took place in a hotel which is the introduction to the odd world and the situation where the plot opens. When it moved to the 2nd half, especially after Rachel Weisz come into the frame, the entire scenario changed to atypical romance mode and kept that way till the last with a simple twist in the finale.Colin Ferrell's character was something like the one from the movie 'Her'.

An excellent analysis on our society's obsession with not being single!,"'THE LOBSTER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A very dark dystopian comedy-drama flick; about a world where single people are required to find romantic partners, within 45-days, or be turned into animals. The film was directed by Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos (in his English-language film debut) and it was written by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou; the duo also performed the same duties on 2011's 'ALPS' and 2009's 'DOGTOOTH' (which is an outstanding flick). It stars Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Lea Seydoux, John C. Reilly, Ben Whishaw, Olivia Colman, Jessica Barden and Angeliki Papoulia (who also costarred in 'DOGTOOTH'). The movie has been a critically praised indie hit, and I think it's a near masterpiece.The film is set in a dystopian world; where single people are sent to a special hotel, once they become single, and they're required to find romantic partners there (within 45-days). If they fail to do so, they're turned into an animal, of their choice, and released into the woods. People who escape the hotel are known as loners; they live out in the woods, as their own community. Loners have similar strict rules (to the contrary); prohibiting any romantic (or sexual) relations. Single people are sent into the woods, to hunt the loners down; if they're successful, they're given an extra day to find a partner. The story revolves around David (Farrell); who was recently dumped by his wife, for another man, and he's sent to the hotel (as the movie begins). David is guided through this stressful process, by his brother; who's now a dog.The film is extremely odd, and funny; but it's also very disturbing. It's shockingly brutal, and sexual, at times. It's also an excellent social commentary, on the world we now live in. That's what I like most about the film; it's definitely exaggerated (in a very dark satirical way), but it's also a great analysis of our society's obsession with not being single. Single people are often ostracized, and severely looked down upon (by the rest of society). This movie isn't really that far off, in the way it illustrates how couple's often harshly treat singles. It's also true that most people follow very strict (and severely superficial) guidelines, in finding romantic partners. Most relationships are formed out of desperation, necessity and drastic conformity. Genuine companionship, and true love, is extremely rare. That's why this movie is so brilliant; it's a nearly perfect examination on life (I'd say). It will be seen as far too weird, slow and harshly critical; for most viewers though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Social commentary on romantic relationships,"OK, so first of, this is a weird movie. It's not for you if you don't like those kind of movies. If, however, you do, it might be right up your alley.The movie represents the constant need for human contact and connection in a weird and sarcastic way. People are not supposed to be alone, at least that's the premise of the movie. And any attempt of doing so is characterized as animal. The basic human emotions needed for creating a deeper connection that could eventually lead into a relationship, are twisted and somewhat ridicule.People have to have a partner not because they want to, but because they need to, according to law. The consequences if they don't are terrible - they are either transformed into animals or hunted down as loners. Naturally they become obsessed, technical, ready to do whatever it takes to find that one person they can form marital unity with.This is a perfect setting to comment everything from sexual orientation, having children, a desperate need to belong to a community. But most of all, it twists and reverse a constant focus on physical traits and physical attraction into a connection based on physical disability.Everything about this movie and its characters is technical, from the way they talk and walk, to the realization of scenes. It is absurd and it is captivating, but also somewhat instructive and warning - it's way better to be alone than to be with the wrong person.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Emperor's New Suit?,"Plenty enough people assured me I would ""love"" Yorgos Lianthos's first English-language film, and I went in expecting quirky/surreal/bizarre. The Lobster is all of these things, without being remotely engaging. Whoever is behind the hype machine is the real genius of the piece; well before we punters were suckered into chancing our arm, a cast of some of contemporary cinema's shining lights signed up for this dog's dinner. Like us, they had no doubt been promised a film the likes of which they had never encountered before and, in this at least, there's some truth. It's hard to recall a more outstandingly irritating movie for many a long year.

The Lobster,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the story is set in a somewhat dystopian future were everyone is expected to get married. Trivial things become the corner stone of relationships like nose bleeds and limps. The story takes the ideas of love, relationships, and societies view of love and turns it into a terrifying world. The story is at time funny and horrifying. The ending is very ambiguous and leaves you feeling stunned. Yorgos Lanthimos directed Dogtooth which is also a black comedy with some very interesting social questions that is much like The Lobster.The acting is very good. Colin Farrell performs the best as an average Joe with nothing special about him at all. Rachel Weisz also performs well as she narrates the story and plays a pivotal part in Colin Farrell's characters story. John C. Reily, Ben Whishaw, Angeliki Papoulia, and Lea Seydoux all perform well.The pacing is very bland and slow. It is done on purpose though. The film wants us to turn into Colin Farrell's character and see his meaningless existence. The music is also a little repetitive and the runtime is overlong.Pros: Interesting, funny, and dark story, great performance by Colin Farrell, good overall acting, a good ending, and slow pacing that was meant on purposeCons: Slow pacing, an overlong runtime, and repetitive use of musicOverall Rating: 8.2",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Strange but relatable flick!!,"This deadpan comedy takes place in a dystopian future where the rules of dating have drastically changed. This film centers around romantically single adults who are staying at a hotel for 45 days. They must find a romantic partner within this time period or they will be cast out of society.ABSURD!! That's the best word to describe this satirical film that pokes fun at the pressure society places on people to get into relationships. The film is surprisingly graphic at times and the plot runs a bit thin in the slow third-act. However, the way this flick examines modern human relationships - is emotionally moving.Final Thoughts: Colin Farrell is as convincing an actor as you'll find and plays this strange role exceptionally well. The movie is slow and is best viewed as a black comedy with some drama intertwined; as opposed to the other way around. The ending is a bit of a let down but works well in this unique film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's not a surprise that it's as mad as a box of frogs because it's directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and every film he's made has his element of oddity about it but The Lobster is off the chart !This is sort of a love story set in a dystopian near future where single people are arrested and transferred to a creepy hotel.

If they fail, they are transformed into an animal and released into the woods.This is my least favourite Yorgos Lanthimos movie .I loved The Killing Of A Sacred Dear and The Favourite and I admired Dogtooth but this really didn't do it for me.The first hour , set at the hotel is good and I enjoyed guessing what was going to happen next but then I felt the film lost it's way in the second half of the movie where it was set in the woods . I just wanted it to stay in that hotel !The entire dialogue is spoken in monotone as if a child , learning to read , is reading it from a book . Nobody has any outward emotion , so when something weird happens there seems to me no reactions or surprise from the characters and I quite liked that . The soundtrack is good too . It gives a real feeling of dread and fear but that never happens visually .The trouble is the film doesn't know how to end . In fact it doesn't end properly at all and that's frustrating .I wanted to see the transformation from human to animal . I wanted to see what happens after the couples go on the boats . I needed more context but that never happened and that's why I wasn't too enamoured with The lobster .There are some good performances from Olivia Coleman, Ashley Jenson and especially Colin Farrell, who put on twenty pounds for the role but still not good enough for me to really like this very strange film .",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Quirky, Dark Comedy; not for everyone","This film tackles a variety of interesting themes through the lenses of this strange and fairly ridiculous dystopian future. The basic premise for the film is that in a dystopian future any single person in society is brought to a hotel where they have 45 days to find a partner or be transformed into the animal of their choosing and be released into the wild. Of course, with that premise the film must have a humor about itself to work and it does. This film from beginning to end has a well balanced sprinkle of dark and depressing moments with this outlook on a future dystopia.While being a rather dark story the film has an understanding of it's own ridiculousness and uses that as the inspiration of the dark humor in almost every scene. While being a very odd film, it says very intelligent things about human behavior and the nature of relationships. Much of the film is an analysis of romance, love, and what a genuine relationship really is. The actors in the film have a lot required of them and they totally deliver. Colin Farrell gives a great performance in the lead role. Due to the nature of their situation and society the characters often have to have a simple complexity to them. We never for a second are questioning the thoughts our motivations of a single character. Every character in the movie is for moments of the film playing a role for the surrounding characters in order to get something they want. For that reason, I saw that it was important that I knew what the characters were thinking. With that said, I found that the frequent voice over by Rachel Weisz to be somewhat tedious and annoying. I wanted to get a feel for these characters and this world and I found my immersion being interrupted by a pointless segment of voice over.This film has very complex storytelling it needs to accomplish and it does so with intricate detail and a clever narrative arch that goes in unexpected directions. There are dozens of moments in the film in which a random out of place animal will drift in the background for a single shot. The style of this film both technically and structurally often reminded me of films like The Master (2012). This film could have easily become hollywoodized and become a movie about a societal revolution but the film keeps the quirkiness and humor and maintains the focus on the situations surrounding Colin Farrell's character of David. This film is so strange in its presentation, in the performances, and in the very dark humor but it still somehow manages to be emotionally and intellectually captivating. Many viewers won't be able to engage with this film which is neither a flaw of the viewer or the film. This movie has a very unique sensibility and style that many people will find off-putting. I, personally, fully bought into this world and these characters and I will be excited to revisit this film again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Visually stunning but ultimately unprofound,"Months later I find I still can't get some of the images in this film out of my head: a figure standing on a distant scree so that it blends into the rock-face, a well-dressed couple walking down a deserted highway lined by hay bales, a dreary-sumptuous hotel interior destined to be as iconic as Kubrick's hexagon-covered Overlook. The Lobster is truly one of the best films of the decade in purely cinematographic terms: all praise to Thimios Bakatakis.I've sat with the allegory—I won't spoil it—for those same months. I am feeling deeply uncertain about its merits. This is not a conventionally engaging film: because of its absurdities an audience will find it difficult to connect to the characters in and of themselves, and so, like the story of the ant and the grasshopper, neither of whom we yearn for or despise, the value of The Lobster must come from its protreptic meaning, what it makes us think about our own world, what lesson it draws us to.That lesson seems to be no more than a string of ambivalent platitudes: love is greater than society, but society will win; there's no ""the one"" out there for you, but wouldn't it be nice if there were—well, maybe there is; human life is like a stay in a hotel, which is nice but also impermanent. I've been waiting for something more, something higher or at least something more original to crawl out of the chrysalis of this film, and now that summer has turned to autumn I've given up hope of new life. In terms of its content, The Lobster is almost irritatingly unmeaningful—not in the way great nihilist art can be, not in the way Fellini is—just grasping at a meaning far, far away from Yorgos Lanthimos' reach.That said, it is well worth the VOD price—even better if it comes to a big screen near you—to experience the film's unique lens and the splendor of its setting. Just don't expect it to transcend the impermanent beauty of a rocky seaside resort.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

What must we do?,"This movie illustrates the problems of social pressure that has to do with marriage and to choose to fit in in a group of others who are like you. It criticizes this subject in a quite comical way. The setting and the plot of the story is obviously exaggerated and only representative of some aspects of the problem. But it does succeed it carrying the deliberate meaning and making the viewer think about the subject again. The overall aura of the movie is dull and awkwardly calm. Not only the visuals, but even the way the characters speak is bland and abnormal. The dullness might make the movie tedious for some people, but it also adds to the effect of delivering its message. Although this movie is saying how the social pressure to conform is unnecessary and even ridiculous, it has an ironic ending, that although is a cliffhanger, leaves room for the viewers to think about it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Orwellian master piece!!!,"Yorgos Lanthimos you sir are a very talented writer and director. The lobster is one of those movies that leave you scratching your head going wtf!!! The story has been beautifully stitched together with extremely interesting concepts and equally awkward characters. Through out the movie i couldn't help but feel there was a certain homage to Orwell. The room the main character (David) stays in at the hotel is 101 which in 1984 was the room for re-programming. There is even a hint of animal farm in there as well with all the crazy animals appearing in certain scenes(including a huge pig). As far as dystopian movies go this has become one of my new favorites!!! Production on this film also needs a mention as the lighting, settings and tone of the movie, all play an integral part in painting the bleak picture of this possible reality!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absurdism in society.,"With scenes as beautiful as dramatic, intelligent touches and good (rare) acting quality, The Lobster is a different movie, extravagant and yes, very rare.
Single men and women must meet in a hotel and get a partner for the next few days, otherwise they will be turned into animals and abandoned. That premise alone sounds peculiar enough, but watching the movie is even more so. Although it is categorized as a comedy and romance, I must admit that I didn't find room within any of those categories. I didn't consider this movie funny at any time, on the contrary, it is disturbing. Don't consider it a romance either, because it's more of a criticism of that romance. This is where the film shines by showing us a palpable message about ""love and society"". A look through a different lens that takes us into a world as pessimistic as it is optimistic, a world without contradictions where everything is perfect, and yet, wrong; a false world.It's worth seeing, even if it feels strange and somewhat tight, and fails miserably in its touches of ''comedy and romance''. It's worth just because of how... rare it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Bizarre dark comedy about a peculiar dystopian world. The first half of the movie is great, then the plot becomes a bit shallow.","""The Lobster"" is set in a dystopian world where being single is illegal. People have 45 days to find another suitable partner, otherwise they will be transformed into an animal. It is an interesting concept that criticizes how society perceives relationships, by highlighting all its dysfunctional aspects: the control that one partner can exert on the other, giving birth hoping that a child can fix a marriage, looking down on single people and putting them on a bad spot, considering them as individuals that do not have their life together or considering them inferior as they are not physically appealing. I was truly terrified by the portrayal of society in this movie, because it is the representation of certain cultures. The events narrated feel credible, despite the exaggeration of certain elements for staging purposes. In the second part the director focuses on the portrayal of jealousy and what heinous actions some people might do because of it. However, from the middle section onwards, the narration is too abstract and the message of Lanthimos is lost between all the different allegories and metaphors. Because of this, I could not fully grasp what was happening. This is also a problem that I faced when I watched ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"". I do not mind a bit of mystery, but for me his narration (at least for these two movies) becomes too cryptic and I am not really able to completely enjoy the plot.I really liked the photography, the composition of certain scenes truly resemble frameworks. I enjoyed the almost emotionless acting that serves well for the purposes of this film, showing a society where feelings are not valued anymore, as relationships are tied only to survival. The cast is phenomenal and we have many great names such as Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz and Léa Seydoux. If you like socially engaged movies and artsy cinema, I strongly suggest you give it a watch. For me this is a solid 6.5.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

What a cast. Bizarre Movie.,"Having literally just finished watching this.

I really don't know how they managed to pull in such a cast for a movie such as this, they must have all loved the script.I like the premise, I liked the dark humour but it broke one of my movie going rules and the ending was completely unsatisfactory and thus I leave myself questioning whether it was worth 2 hours of my viewing time.Overall, yes, for the off the wall plot, I was never bored and everyone is putting in a quality acting shift. But it is so marginal I can only provide 7/10 as I am left unfulfilled.I had a similar experience with Martha Marcy May Marlene.A previous reviewer stated that if you are unimpressed with the first 20 mins then you are best not continuing.

"Random, dark story that changes its tone halfway through","""The Lobster"" is quite a unique experience. It's a story about a man in the near future in a hotel that's designed to help single people find a mate, or be turned into an animal if one fails to do so. It's a tale of loneliness, love, and transformation. The deadpan nature of the actors and environment mixed with the grim, silly humor makes me feel like this film would be the result if the boys from Monty Python tried making a serious movie. The characters are mostly apathetic, as it seems those in charge in the future wants everybody to lack emotion, which sort of adds to the hilarity. It's a weird movie, but I enjoyed it. Although I feel like I would've enjoyed it more while drunk. It starts off well and rather funny, but it gets more serious as it goes on, and sort of loses its charm a bit. A film such as this that starts off dark and humorous but loses its humor towards the end, just becomes dark and depressing. However it is still an enjoyable flick, worth seeing.What really got me laughing, were the absurd attempts by the establishment to stress that being part of a couple is better than being single. No spoilers here, but in particular as an example, is what the dart-shooting instructor says to the man from room 187, as he calls him up to take his turn. This is just one example of many. The comedy is emotionless, blunt, bleak, and seems to mirror the lives of those in reality who struggle to find a partner.There are obvious social commentaries in the film, driving home messages of loneliness, relationships (especially ones that are forced, either from within oneself, or by an outside force), and government's forcefulness and knack for butting in where it's not wanted. You can take it more seriously like this, pretend that the film has a point. Or you can just go along for the random, ridiculous ride.
Just be prepared for it to be a different movie at the end than how it starts.If you liked this (or you haven't seen it yet but have enjoyed some of the following), I will recommend a few films/tv shows. There's a movie that is even more random than this one called ""Rubber,"" about a killer telekinetic tire. Hilarious, and quite misunderstood. There's also ""Black Mirror,"" an excellent show on the nature of society and technology, ""The Lobster"" seems to me to be a similar in terms of social criticism in the future. Then there's ""In Bruges,"" a hidden gem also starring Colin Farrell. There is also ""Withnail & I,"" ""Equilibrium,"" ""Harold & Maude,"" and ""Barton Fink.""",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A puzzle that may or may not be worth figuring out,"As everyone has clearly stated this film is weird.I was not familiar with the film when it popped up on Amazon. I checked it out solely because I enjoy Rachel Weiss....how bad could it be?Bad isn't the word for this film. Rather, confused. I think you spend the majority of the time during the initial watching trying to figure out WHY the heck the things you are watching are happening. Its a strange world and about 2/3s of the film feels like like watching a puzzle slowly take shape.When you finally figure out the why, things get even odder. The motivations of the main characters become something of a complete mystery--why do they return to the hotel to torment their former 'friends'? Why do they feel the need to venture to town? Why does the lead character feel he must make the choice he faces in the mirror? Its a weird turn for someone who appears to have come to reject the rules of both communities represented in the film.I guess the big theme the film wrangles with is how society forces a narrative on our lives and how people brainwash themselves to fit into those stories. An interesting twist is how whether one choose the mainstream story or the rebel/alternative story, either one requires an individual to brainwash and contort themself into an psychological pretzel.The commentary about relationships embedded in the film is rather chilling but rings a bit true. Altbeit its a bit much to think of a world where being single is the most aberrant thing a person could opt for.Perhaps a second watching may help with puzzling the whys out, but its a rather slow movie and I have yet to devote the time and attention to trying to sort out the subtle themes. I am not sure I will take a stab at it again, but its a curious enough film that I am tempted.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Please stop narrating movies and let the viewer experience the journey along with the characters.

Another facet of the movie is what people are willing to do and endure to stay in a relationship and society. Turning the victims into animals is at the same time denying the animal in all humans and keeping the animal out of society.Also the movie makes a point of making everybody talking super polite and with a low voice.

It Takes Two,"(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A partly successful mix of surreal satire with some very perceptive moments.GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: A man must choose his fate and form in a dystopian society obsessed with coupling.JIM'S REVIEW: The Lobster takes an absurd comic premise and reworks it into a dark satire about love and relationships. Set in the not-to-distant future, David (Colin Farrell), a recently divorced Loner, has an urgent need to find a new partner. Why the deadline, you may ask? No, it's not due to his loneliness causing him to go directly into the dating pool to find another soulmate (although he is a sad and desperate man)...it's just that he must connect with another human being in order to survive. At least, in his present form. You see, this totalitarian government stipulates that unless he gets a girl, within 45 days, he will be turned into another species..a dog, a lion, a lobster...that, at least, will be his choice in this brave new world.￼Director / Writer Yorgo Lanthimos creates a bizarre and compelling film, although he tests the patience of many moviegoers with his purposely ambiguous detours in his plot. The film is quite effective in its first half as David checks into a resort that prides itself on transformation and conformity. Irony is layered in its thick impasto strokes of surreal imagery and intellectual musings about society's obsession with coupling and partnership. Less successful is the film's second section which begins to meander and lose its way (just like its main character does). Yet the talented Mr. Lanthimos brings forth clever insights and a unique narrative to his Orwellian tale.￼The international cast works within the limits of their unusual characters. Colin Farrell portrays David nicely as a pawn in the scheme of things while other fine actors, like Rachael Weisz, Ben Whishaw, John C. Reilly, Lea Seydoux, and Olivia Coleman bring solid support to this odd yet thought-provoking film.￼But it is Lanthimos' screenplay (co-authored with Efthymis Filippou) that relies on the vague notion of obedient submissiveness that remains unclear from the start. The film lacks genuine pathos and subtle humor, never allowing its interesting subject to fully resonate. Characters remain one dimensional and their actions baffling and strange. Except for David, everyone is nameless...Nosebleed Woman, Lisping Man, Biscuit Woman, Limping Man, Short-Sighted Woman, etc. This may be an intentional decision by the filmmaker, but it does give a slight artsy silliness to the whole venture. And let's not even discuss the film's enigmatic and disappointing denouncement!However, Lanthimos is a far better director than storyteller. His use of slow motion techniques, poetic voiceovers, and mix of classical and atonal music gives his film an eerie otherworldly sense of time and place. He has his actors deliver that lines with flat readings and very little emotion which somehow works to his advantage in creating a loveless universe.￼The Lobster is the type of film that will garner critical praise but leave the average moviegoer questioning the film's overall effect. Its characters are a passive and soulless lot, even if this filmgoing experience rarely achieves its complex goal.Still The Lobster is a noble effort by a gifted filmmaker worthy of one's attention.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"'It's not Science fiction, it's an over-extended university Arts project.'","Before I slate this film, I just want to make it clear that I didn't find this movie truly awful due to a lack of intelligence and understanding but quite the opposite.It was painfully obvious from the outset that 'The Lobster' is highlighting the embarrassing awkwardness of conditioned humans trying to find love or feeling forced to.It made the same point over and over again for nearly two hours whilst smothering the viewer with that obvious, over-used, ""quirky"" style now common in the advertising industry.I feel the kind of people this movie would appeal to are the very same over educated, out of touch, pompous people that would spend £1,000,000 on 120 bricks piled neatly into a rectangle.It's like they used all that hard earned cash they've made producing adverts for Banks with quirky banjo-playing students in the background to make one, big, long, boring film.I would go into extreme detail picking this film apart artistically but I've already wasted nearly two hours of my life watching it.It's not Science fiction, it's an over-extended university Arts project.Wishy-Washy, dull and like an idea in it's early stages.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Therefore one cannot avoid rules either way.Within this outline the movie satirizes the soulmate cliché, how one can only fall in love with a certain person and that person only.

"Offbeat, very black comedy – not for everyone","In a dystopian world, where single people are required to find appropriate partners or be turned into animals, a counterculture of loners exist, where romantic relationships are punished by mutilation. Colin Ferrell's character, whose wife has left him, moves from one culture, in which he has decided to become a lobster if he cannot find a mate, to the other, where he falls in love with Rachel Weisz's character, and suffers the consequences. The movie is slow moving, dead-pan and surreal – whimsical in some places, coarse and brutal in others. Cryptic and metaphorical, the story takes place in three locations: 'the hotel', where you need to find a mate, 'the woods' where the loners roam, and 'the city' where couples live. Keeping with the premise that you need to find your match rather than an autonomous person, few of the characters have names, but rather are known by a 'characteristic' (e.g. girl with nose bleeds) that is the basis for initial pairing (if a singleton) or by their job (e.g. 'the maid).

The description looked promising... but it failed to work,"A man is sent to a hotel where he has to find a mate in a few weeks time. If not, he will be transformed into an animal of his choice. That was the description I read and which made me think: ""That's an interesting idea! This could be fun!"" Unfortunately, that's where the fun ended.The beginning of this movie is acceptable and still made me wonder where it was heading to. However it became more apparent with every minute that this movie was heading nowhere (sorry if that's a spoiler). Especially after the escape by the main character from the hotel the thing went from bad to worse.The scene which at an early stage crashed my hopes was the first of two scenes in which the the loners in the hotel have to watch ridiculous performances of the advantages of being together instead of alone. OK, so we have some absurdism, I was prepared for that. But this scene of having grown adults watch these scenes without some of them laughing out loud or boo-ing was totally unconvincing.From that moment the thing went completely down the hill, alternating between supposedly funny moments (ahem) and shocking scenes including disgusting cruelty towards animals.I have watched movies, which ended quite sad, but still caused me to leave the cinema in a good mood, like, ""well at least they really loved each other"", or ""who knows what good will happen to them in the future"". The Lobster did none of this. By the time the movie was dragging to its insufferable long ending, I had seen the message that the director wanted to give (apparently) so many times that I had gone totally numb.The most ridiculous was the scene where the loners in the wood (they are depicted like a kind of para military group in this society of couples) speak to their spy in the hotel. Suddenly they start to talk in French. It actually reminded me of Allo Allo (Michelle: ""Now listen carefully, I will say zis only whence""). It would have been funny except that at this time I was more concerned with my mobile phone keeping track of the time and waiting for the monster to end.Now I know that movies are not made to please me but honestly, this is piece of garbage.

"A Perfect Film in Every Way, But... I Didn't Like It","The Lobster is directed and co-written by Yorgos Lanthimos (LAN-TH-E-MOS(T)), and stars Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, LÃ©a Seydoux and John C. Reilly. The film takes place in a dystopian future and follows a recently widowed man, David, being sent away to The Hotel, where he must find a romantic partner in forty-five days, or he, alongside the other residents, will be turned into an animal and sent out into the wild. Originally premiering at festivals back in 2015, The Lobster, didn't get a mainstream limited release until 2016, and wow what an interesting piece of art this film is.The Lobster, is a very peculiar film, that has a lot to say about the themes of love, and how it is represented in our society today. The film uses its representation of love and societal expectations through the use of The Hotel, wherein the residents there have a set amount of time to find a love interest or they'll be disowned and turned into an animal of their choosing. Those who choose to escape The Hotel, can live amongst the outsiders in the woods, where they must abide by a different ruleset, and not be intimate with any persons of that group, all while being hunted by The Hotel residents. These black and white themes of love presented in The Lobster, are ever-present in our society today; with beliefs of settling down with a partner before the age of 40, as to not appear as a black sheep, and individuals who choose to be single also adhere to similar types of societal expectations.
The Lobster, excels at presenting these larger themes, alongside smaller allegories, such as the notion of 'love is blind'. This is an expertly crafted film, that plays out like an evil Wes Anderson movie due to its absurdist dark humour and delivery of the dialogue, which I may add is also perfect. There was not one bad performance in The Lobster, from the menacing, Heartless Woman played by Angeliki Papoulia, to the loveable Lisping Man portrayed by John C. Reilly or even the intimidating Loner Leader, which LÃ©a Seydoux depicts excellently. However, the heart of the film solely rests on Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, who are imperfect as much as they are charismatic. Their characters represent the grey, in an otherwise black and white world and exemplify the idea of how far one would go for love. Their performances carry this film and keep the audience engaged with the madness going on around them, as they are the most 'normal' of the bunch.
There is not an aspect to The Lobster which I do not respect, I think that it is a daring film, that perfects the risks it takes. It is a gorgeous looking film (with its standard-looking shots), the aesthetic of the movie seems to be carefully put together and that sort of attention to detail does not go unnoticed. The Lobster, is also very humorous, with dark jokes planted throughout that are usually accompanied by a score that feels grandiose, giving the comedy an extra layer.
Although I have gloated about the movie and cannot find a single imperfection, I was not the biggest fan of the film. I can sit here and respect the filmmaking all day, however, it should be noted that this was not my favourite film ever while watching it. It's not something I can outright explain and might require further viewings to fully love, however, I just do not feel the need to rewatch this film right away. I found myself a little bored halfway through, to no fault of the film, as I feel its pacing mostly works. It might just be one of those films I can highly respect but don't get a lot of enjoyment out of, outside of breaking down its somewhat complex themes. For that reason, although I appreciate the craft, and the length the filmmakers went to when making this film, it is not something I can recommend to anyone. It is a very weird film, and some of the ideas may not resonate with a general audience. I'm not doubting my feelings could change towards this film, but as it stands right now The Lobster gets a 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film will get under your skin!,"I disagree with the first reviewer here, who notes ""ugly imagery throughout."" Many of the scenes were gorgeous views of trees, forest, dappled light. Those beautifully shots scenes, combined with hauntingly gorgeous music, were quite an odd combination with the action: characters moving woodenly, awkwardly through the forest, etc. I enjoyed almost every aspect of this film -- just a couple of scenes that were hard or impossible to watch (both thankfully fairly short). For sure, I will be thinking about the ideas the film presented for many days ahead...Asborbing its truth consciously and subconsciously. The main ""message"" I took away is that any social demands about how relationships are ""supposed"" to be will inevitably warp those relations.

What a rare way to display an idea on social conformity,"The LobsterWhat a rare way to display an idea on social acceptance. A near or distant future, depending on how you view our civilizations trajectory, clues us in to the societal norms that could develop given circumstance and instance.The story follows the life of David, (Colin Farrell) a man who has recently been rejected by his partner of 11 years and one month. In this dystopian version of life people who are single or cast out of relationships must follow protocol in order to regain the right to live within society again. In this world the main function of society is to create pairs, for if you have a partner you can better understand how life is supposed to be lived, or so the thinking is thought.Once cast out of a relationship, or once one is found to be single they are directed to the hotel. At the hotel you have 45 days to either find a mate or, given the circumstance that you find no mate, decide what kind of animal you want to be transformed into.David and the people that interact within the film speak purportedly and with an indifference matched only by artificial intelligence. To show emotion is adverse or unnecessary, depending on which negative branch you believe in, in utilizing the process of matchmaking. See in order for a relationship to be built there has to be a common ground that both can stand upon. For instance near sightedness, a limp, or perhaps the same hair type are all reason enough for a pair to match.David shows emotion rarely throughout the film but is one of the only characters that show any emotion at all. Traversing the halls of the cursed hotel he figures out what he doesn't want to know and how escape might become possible.But once escape is achieved what else can there be?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Dystopia Is Better Tolerated With A Partner,"""The Lobster"" Features a comically dystopian story that is frightfully accurate. The score accentuates and compliments both form and content, always adding to but never intruding on the other elements. The Production design, cinematography, and Yorgos Lanthimos' vision come together spectacularly through the use of appropriate color, lighting, angles, and symbolism.Everything is placed into shots for a reason, whether it's an ominous tranquilizer gun, a now transformed family member, or a salt and pepper shaker set... Mise en scene is masterfully handled in a way that treats the appreciative viewer to one Easter egg after another.The story is brutally honest. We are already in a society that values partnerships (even forced partnerships) over singlehood, and ""The Lobster"" clearly satirizes this, but then goes one step farther to explore forced singledom. Both are unhealthy means to a traumatic and artificial end, as the unnerving ending of this film harrowingly demonstrates.Awarded a well deserved 7 stars of 10. I'm looking forward to Lanthimos' ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer.""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Save your money,"I have read reviews on this waste of time that call it a comedy. Okay if you have a very sick sense of humor.

The idea of the film is interesting, the acting is acceptable, other than that give this a pass until it is out of the theaters. Oh, that is unless you think it will make you 'cool' to say that you wasted that money and the time watching this film. My thought is that it won those awards because people were paid to do so.

Until you realize that The Lobster is a dystopian satire and a modern lifestyle. It's like Black Mirror with only a stem.

The open ending generally leaves the viewer with his mouth open, because he simply breaks leaving the viewer with his thoughts.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Major weirdness, disappointing","Don't be deceived by the clever trailer. Don't be drawn in by the top notch acting talent. This is full blown weirdness for the sake of being weird. Not very funny, unless you think a ""red kiss,"" the cutting off of a couple's lips because they were seen kissing, is funny. Not quirky so much as flat, monotone, and slow as a lobster itself. The bulk of it consists of long dull flat monologues punctuated by an occasional chuckle and gratuitous maiming. Poorly paced, gratuitously violent, alternately odd, bizarre, and just plain stupid. ""The Lobster"" is bound to be a cult classic but unless you are about 21, steeped in surrealism and psychosis, and very angry about romance, it's not for you.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'm not quite sure what I just watched... but I'm pretty sure I loved it,"The Lobster is so unapologetically bonkers its hard not to love it. It will leave you feeling very confused and gobsmacked after finishing, it certainly did me at least!I'm not quite sure where to start with this, but perhaps the plot is a good place to kick off. It's bizarre, there's no avoiding that. I really haven't seen anything like it, and am not sure I ever will again. Yorgos Lanthimos created such a wickedly weird and creative near future world, where nothing made sense, yet within its own little world it all worked and clicked., making perfect sense. There were so many little details and nuances, so many interesting threads being plucked constantly, and so much to take in given the relatively short two hour runtime. The story will also keep you on your toes due to its originality and uniqueness, making it very hard to predict.The performances throughout were excellent. The film demanded almost very flat, levelled and stoic performances, with not much surface level emotion, and all of the cast delivered this excellently, giving the film a haunting and sinister feel. As the leads Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz were great, with solid supporting performances from the likes of Olivia Coleman and Lea Seydoux.The whole style of the film worked so well. From the booming and sporadic score to the bleak colours and the camera work. Everything fitted together to make a truly intriguing piece of cinema.This film most certainly won't be for everyone, with its eccentricity either winning you over or putting you off. For me it was this uniqueness that gave it its charm and drew me in. It's as strange as anything, but all the better for it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Near Future is Not as Sexy as we Once Thought,"If you go on the website for The Lobster, it has a wonderfully clever way of introducing you to the film, as well as what the film is all about. As soon as you enter the site, it will ask you a series of questions that will determine what second-chance animal you should pick if you do not find love. At the end of the brief quiz, you will be given three choices based on your answers. From there, you have to pick one, and that's the animal you have to turn into if you do not find the right mate in forty-five days. From there, you can have a second- chance at love as a dog, cat, fish, flamingo, or whatever. My three animals I ended up with was a bison, gorilla, and horse. Of which one I decided to turn into, that is for you to find out.This strange consideration of our sex life perfectly sums up everything talked about in the European satirical drama, The Lobster, with a call to revision on how an aristocratic society controls our path to satisfaction with a significant other.What's shocking is that this dystopian world does not look far off from where we are now. Considering our high expectations surrounding sexual preference and gender roles, filmmakers in Europe knew that it was time to make a psychodrama like this to depict how our revision of sexual stimulation will change in the next few years.Within this future, we are put in the shoes of David, a loner abandoned by his wife who has become numb over time to light and noise. In fact, neither he nor anyone else in his life show any hint of feeling at all. A calming narration by a mystery woman tells about how he is left to live in a hospital with restricting rules: he can't keep any of his personal belongings, he must wear one of their identical change of clothes, and within his forty-five day stay there, he must find love with another woman, or be turned into the animal of his choosing. In this case, he chose a lobster for its long lifespan. Whoever the narrator of this story is meant to be, by the film's final moments, the cruciality of the voice's identity will become clear.In this unsettling world, change for healthy relationships is initiated as they teach the men that they must be dependent on a lover, and the women are taught how their safety is dependent on a man. The staff even goes as far as punishing secret masturbators with a toaster to the hand. If there are any loners hiding out in the moss-infested woods nearby, they are captured by patients with tranquilizer darts and sent to the well-maintained seaside hospital.The surreal nature of this motion picture feels complete with a disruptive baroque musical, creating a haunting beat you will never remove from your memory. It evokes the lack of apparent fear, making the peacocks and camels seen wandering the woods feel expectant. The only change of thought the characters ever express is when a brother-turned-dog meets an unfortunate fate, and a girl's failed suicide attempt. It turns out though that creating a world without feeling generates all sorts of challenges for even the greatest of cinema artists.While the characters certainly don't feel much, neither does the audience. A motion picture like this one ought to show master over orchestrating the audience to feel what the character's don't, which The Lobster does not fully succeed at. It gets harder to keep up with everything as well with the second half, when everything becomes practically a different type of movie with new characters and a new setting.But it doesn't make The Lobster any less brilliant in its call to reconsideration of our own emotions. Director Yorgos Lanthimos makes it plainly clear how animals these days have a healthier concept of romance than we people do, as the turnaround of one man chained by unnecessary rules speaks to us.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rather funny and quite interesting,"The Lobster may be a comedy but it does seem quite like the marriage system of some countries where you are suppose to marry (arrange marriage or indirectly arranged through relatives or friends of relatives) based on qualifications, the amount of money you make, the net worth you have (real estate and other properties or wealth), and related material factors. The main factor being a set of rules created by society that you are supposed to be married by a certain age, have kids by a certain age, and have all your financial affairs in order otherwise you are considered a failure by the society and lack respect of it. Your intellect, abilities, skills, morality, or ethics have no value if you do not possess material gains. It is almost like a business deal rather than something you grow into organically based on your love for someone.I am going a little off script as what I mentioned does not all constitute the part of this movie but it has a gist of it (the 45 days in terms of the time you have to marry (as I mentioned earlier about proper age of marriage and all) otherwise you are no better than an animal who is useless and does not belong in the society).But getting back to the movie; it is quite entertaining where you get to see Colin Farrell's acting in a different light.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting To A Point,"I'm not familiar with the director's other works but based on a solid cast and some good reviews I thought I'd give The Lobster a look. It definitely starts off strong and once the premise was revealed I was very curious to see how it would further develop. It certainly looks good and is visually attractive and interesting. The performance are all solid as well. The manner in which the film spoofs, satirizes, and questions modern relationships and our increasingly technical/machine/impersonal modes of communication was often times funny and thought-provoking. However, after about a third of the way into this story, I found it to grow a little thin and beginning to lose focus.

Amusing and poignant satire about human companionship,"So many great stories end with the message that life is meant to be shared with someone else. This statement, in all likelihood, is one a majority of people in the world would agree with. The latest film from Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, however, will make you seriously consider if not refute this universally held belief.As he did with his Oscar-nominated foreign film ""Dogtooth,"" Lanthimos builds a concept- driven story in ""The Lobster"" that explores the possibilities of how humans would react to well-intentioned extremism. And like ""Dogtooth,"" ""The Lobster"" puts its viewer in the most uncomfortable of situations through Lanthimos' patented blunt/deadpan sexual situations and violence.""The Lobster"" imagines a dystopian Europe in which romantic companionship is both required and strictly enforced. We experience the process of finding a partner through the eyes of David (Colin Farrell), a man whose wife has just left him, which means he must go back to The Hotel, where with the help and guidance of management, guests must find a partner and fall in love in 45 days or be turned into animals and sent into the woods.This bizarre and intriguing premise is sure to capture the attention of just about any imaginative movie fan, but only so many will be able to handle Lanthimos' bold, often unsettling and especially provocative style, which induces squirms as much as intellectual stimulation.The world and satirical analogy that Lanthimos has constructed with writing partner Efthymis Filippou is elaborate, which becomes extremely apparent when you learn that there are ""loners"" out in the woods, those who fled The Hotel, are trying to live on their own and diametrically oppose the values of civilization to the same strict degree. Hotel guests and encouraged to hunt these people down, and they earn extra time at The Hotel in exchange for captures.Bolstered by an excellent cast that includes Rachel Weisz, Ben Whishaw, John C. Reilly, Lea Seydoux and Olivia Colman, ""The Lobster"" examines Western society's romantic standards and structures through these exaggerations in hopes of uncovering some greater truths about love and the lengths people will go to to find it (and in some cases, fake it).Lanthimos is not shy about shocking the audience, but ""The Lobster"" demonstrates some growth in this arena; he dials back some of the explicit imagery (particularly the nudity) as if recognizing that suggested sexual situations can be just as if not more powerful than depicted ones. He has no shortage of opportunities in the film to show nudity or sex and opts for none, letting the audience's imagination do the work and elicit its own potent reaction. Violence, on the other hand, the film is not shy about, though Lanthimos opts for disturbing and awkward rather than gory and gratuitous.The impact of these choices tremendously benefits ""The Lobster."" Although there's no denying the brusque, uncomfortable nature of the film, these tactics aren't as big of a distraction as they were in ""Dogtooth."" As a result, what we do see doesn't rattle us beyond any possible comprehension of themes and ideas, but provokes them. And there's plenty of breathing room to let it all sink in.""The Lobster"" provides incredibly fresh perspective on and sharp insight into love and relationships, something that will undoubtedly resonate with those viewers intrigued enough by the premise and not repelled by its explicit situations. Its ambiguous ending will annoy some and multiply the adoration of others, but regardless, it succeeds at pushing the viewer to really consider all of its many facets and ideas. As long as Lanthimos can continue to strike the balance between challenging ideas and images and thoughtful ones, he'll continue to make great films for a long time.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Everything is odd, the screenplay itself and also the characters.

One of the best movie experiences I had in a while,I recommend seeing this like I did. I had not seen any trailer or heard anything about this movie. My brother recommended it and said I should not look up anything because then I had no expectations and no knowledge of the plot which would make it surreal. The experience was surreal and fantastic.

Cute Black Comedy - The Lobster,"This film reminded me of Clockwork Orange, although it was not as good as that film. The people in this film suffer from ED, and I am not speaking about erectile dysfunction, but emotional disconnection. I believe that this is not really a dystopian tale, but a tale about people who have trouble making emotional connections.The film is very funny as long as you do not take it seriously, which of course, no sane person would. The psycho babble of the supposed caretakers are the funniest lines in the film. It would appear as if only middle and upper class people get the royal treatment here at Club S&M Spa. No working class or poor people could afford such luxuries.I had trouble believing in the dystopian power structure here having so much power over individuals; unless of course, we are talking about a state like New Jersey, where this system might work. Colin Farrell does a wonderful job as an emotional disconnect, as do several of the supporting cast; especially one of my favorite comedians, John C Reilly, who brings us about five minutes or so of lowbrow comedy that relieves us from concentrating on breaking the comedic code of this black comedy. Although it moves slowly, the film does have its moments. Not recommended for those who take things literally.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Weird but original! 6/10,"Review: This is one of the strangest movies I have seen this year. I really didn't know were the movie was going, right from the beginning and when the film started to get going, it just became more weird. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the originality of the film but it was really strange from one scene to the next. The strange laws that they had in the hotel and the forest, were mind blowing and the fact that this individuals were being punished for being single, made it intriguing and, a somewhat, weird experience. The scenes with the eyes went a bit to far and the ending did annoy me but on the whole, I would watch it again, because I didn't understand how David (Colin Farrell), ended up in such a predicament. It did seem like it was jumping from one scene to the next, without much explanation but the narrating all the way through the film did help matters. The acting is great from Farell, who put on a lot of weight for the role and his heartless wife (Rosanna Hoult) and new found love (Rachel Weisz), were great choices for this quirky movie. Personally, I have to watch the movie again to work out if I actually enjoyed it or I was more shocked with it, so I'll have to sit on the fence for this one. Watchable!Round-Up: Colin Farrell, 39, has starred in some mediocre movies lately which haven't really done that well at the box office, like the disappointing A New York Winter's Tale, the unknown Miss Julie alongside Jessica Chastain, Dead Man Down, Total Recall, Seven Psychopaths and Fright Night but he put in a great performance in Saving Mr. Banks, Horrible Bosses and the new True Detective series. I doubt that this movie will bring him back into the big leagues but it has definitely shown that he will take on any project and give it his all. This is the first major release from Greek born, Yorgos Lanthimos, who also wrote this original but strange script. It must have been hard to bring his vision to the big screen so I have to give him respect for that and the fact that Rachel Weisz, Colin Farrell, Olivia Colman and John C. Reilly came on board, proves that they saw something in this original in the script. As I didn't hear anything about the movie before, I really didn't know what to expect and now that I've watched it, I'm still in 2 minds about the outcome.Budget: $4million Worldwide Gross: $5.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/romance/comedies starring Rachel Weisz, Colin Farrell, John C. Reilly, Olivia Colman, Rosanna Hoult, Michael Smiley and Roger Ashton-Griffiths. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Any scene or concept makes no sense whatsoever. I stayed till the end in hope of some twist or some meaningful conclusion but the movie makers wanted to end it in shutter island style. Instead of leaving people spellbound, it leaves the watcher thinking this is the stupidest movie I ever chose to see. A few disturbing- totally unnecessary and do not add to any charm of the movie. In short, the only good thing about it is the good camera work, but totally worthless to see given that absolutely nothing else is good about the movie. Do not go by its high ratings, if I could give it a -10 rating, I'd go with it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Delightful experience,"It's not because I'm Greek, honestly, it's not. Or maybe it is, maybe there's something ingrained, some sort of deeply-rooted, ethnic support thing going on, I don't know.I choose to believe that it's because I haven't watched such a well-made black comedy in years.Because deadpan sarcasm speaks to me on a fundamental, primitive level.Because hyperrealism is a powerful medium that, when used in the right way, can successfully create a dream-layered utopia where logic diminishes into nothing but an unwelcome afterthought after it has graciously offered its place to a fantastical world of boundless possibilities. And this is what Lanthimos did for me – it broke down the social limits as I know them and challenged me to think, not farther, but deeper into my own being.Ultimately, the Lobster is an understated, dystopian love story that effortlessly made me laugh out loud while staring in its fun-house mirror of distortions — a claim not many movies can boast to have cast upon me.And more to the crucial point, it's the one bloody film I didn't find myself needing bloody subtitles to understand Colin bloody Farrell's insane bloody dialect.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Insane but unmissable I think,"Set in a dystopian world in what feels like a 1960's/70's setting The Lobster is a unique movie about love. Described on IMDb as a comedy, It might be one of the blackest comedies I've seen, or alternatively, it is an idea of a bleak past/future. It is shot in a very stark and minimalist way, reminiscent of Fahrenheit 451, so the quality of the acting is essential, ergo, this is not a Hollywood production! Colin Farrell shows a surprising acting ability, by being a nobody, an uninteresting guy you wouldn't take a second glance at. Rachel Weisz as the female lead is her usual brilliant self (she is also the narrator of the tale) and Olivia Coleman as the Hotel Manageress is fantastic.

"The Lobster is going to be one of those memorable films for me which, I will never forget because of its uniqueness and twists.","Let me first start this review with the reason why I watched the film. I was mainly persuaded to see this movie because I was struck by the uniqueness of its concept. I actually saw this title in a Facebook page's list of recommended films to watch and upon reading its concept, I instantly became interested with it. And as early as now, I am saying that the film did not disappoint me.Frankly, upon seeing the opening scene, I did not have an idea on what the movie is going to be and I really love the fact that the story did not give hints on how it is going to end. In addition, I love how the writer incorporated symbolism in the story.The film also reminds me of some Wes Anderson films as I have noticed in some of the movie's shots, framing and direction. However, I can definitely say that director has his own style making his craft. I was also impressed with the film's production design. I love how the details really make the world of the film a kind of reality to the eyes of an audience like me.

Goofy and dull,"Even after the obligatory head-scratching from the confusing opening (and the usual, modern day mumbling mix of poor speech delivery and horribly mixed background sound and music), this film just takes too much getting used to. Some of the tres-noir humor is quite funny, but mostly lost in the flat affects and depressing absurdity. I recently saw an excellent local production of ""Waiting for Godot,"" and it was downright light-hearted compared to this. After ten minutes I was saying ""got it,"" and not sure why I sat through the rest. To what depths goes sarcastic satire? Apparently endless.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
My mouth was hanging open for most of the film,Absolutely fascinating. Yorgos Lanthimos is a mad man and I love him for it. Dogtooth blew my mind. Lobster followed suit and was hands down my favorite movie of 2016. These films are so refreshingly weird and non-formulaic. Where can I stream The Killing of the Sacred Deer?

Art or self-indulgent drivel?,"Many years ago, as a young film student, I attended a screening of a film called ""Savages"" at which the director, James Ivory, was present for Q and A. Savages is about a group of primitives who stumble out of the forest to find an abandoned mansion. They enter and, one by one, assume the various trappings of civilization. One character finds and plays a cello. And, as you could have guessed, one by one, they leave the mansion to return to their presumably more noble lives in the wild.After the screening one attendee earnestly asked Ivory, ""By having the cellist be the last one to leave the mansion were you making the statement that it is the artist who is the last to appreciate his art?"" Ivory bemusedly shrugged and responded, ""Um, no, I mean, somebody had to leave last.""I think of that moment when I see a film like The Lobster and see how very hard some people will work to ascribe profound meaning to what some others will dismiss as self- indulgent drivel.I'll concede that's probably too strong a criticism in this case. The Lobster's artifice, which I won't bother to describe since so many of the other reviews have done so already, is clever enough and the film has its moments, some of which are genuinely funny.The struggle to find loving relationships and dealing with loneliness are central tenets of our existence and Lanthimos deserves credit for examining them in an offbeat and inventive way. But, despite it's ardor, The Lobster fails to develop the subject matter in any meaningful way or reveal anything particularly insightful. It pretty much says all it has to say in the first 30 minutes and the rest of its two-hour length finds us waiting for a point which never comes.By itself that might have been excusable were it not for a relentlessly somber tone and pace that wore me down to the point where any concern I had for the characters was replaced by an obsession with checking my watch to see how much more I'd have to endure.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Favorite film in the last two years.. Amazing and overlooked!,Wow.. Yorgos is an absolute genius. Colin Farrell gets the role of his lifetime and just kills it. I would have given both men Oscars. This was easily the best movie but the Oscars snub-ed it not sure why? Maybe they try to choose American productions more... Who knows they blew it and we all know that. I have seen this film six times now and it is incredible entertainment every time. Watch this film and enjoy the best black comedy in recent history!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dystopian comedy,"""The Lobster"" might not be for everybody, but I dare you to find a film with the same atmosphere, the same themes, and that makes the same simple but thought-provoking reflections on society and interpersonal relationships. In many ways, it's actually more straightforward and accessible than a lot of mainstream dystopian films: clearly recognizable elements of our society are just pushed to their grotesque extremes. There are no complex metaphors to decipher or convoluted plots to follow. Lanthimos' offbeat sense of humor cannot appeal to everyone, though, as he has a tendency to stay always detached from his world while making fun of his characters. The first half at the hotel is undoubtedly the film's highlight, but it's actually the second half that gives a whole new perspective. After all, the characters are just forced to switch from one totalitarian system to another, and even after finally finding freedom, they end up naturally adhering to the same absurd rules.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It takes a devoted film fan to watch this, and I thought it was worth two hours","There was definitely a lot said in the film, even though the characters - by intent - often had little to say.. What they did say was always in a monotone - by intent.I kept passing on watching this, then I gave it a shot one time and got maybe a minute or two into it and gave up for some unknown reason. But tonight it seemed like the most intriguing thing I had available to watch so I gave it a try, and I'm glad I did.As at least one other reviewer has pointed out, this film does seem slow to the point of being painful at times, but that really isn't something that could have been avoided as the story really couldn't have been told any other way.If you love to be challenged by a film and are patient, then this is one to watch.There are a couple of things to mention. The electronic music dance scene at about an hour and 21 minutes into it is genius. The other thing is the poster design - it really says everything about the film without giving a single thing away.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unconventional and hilarious.,"'The Lobster' is, as the poster says, an unconventional love story. The film is about a man named David (Colin Farrell). This man just recently lost his wife and, in this near future, that denotes being forced to try and find someone new. He his sent to a hotel where he stays for forty five days. Here he is pushed to find a new partner or be turned into a animal and released into the wild. Is this fairly outlandish and rather implausible? Sure. But once you see the film, it will all make sense. It is very strange yet it works so well. Everything 'The Lobster' does seems to have a purpose. Especially the things that feel a bit too over the top. This is what makes this film so special. The story so incredibly strange and original that it's near impossible not to be sucked into its world. The fact that everything falls into place in such a perfect manner is in large part thanks to Colin Farrell and his immensely committed performance.In fact everyone involved does a fantastic job in their own monotone roles. It's strange to be saying how great everyone is because of how little emotion these characters seem to have. It takes these great actors and tells them to do something that is incredibly hard. Be dull but not boring.Again, it's just the right amount of over the top and weird to work. What the film is actually trying to say here is open to interpretation. And there are many different things that it seems to be saying. The most predominate message that is being said is obviously about relationships.It starts in the first few moments to last few moments. It talks about how many of us see relationships and the things that are deemed ""romantic"". It's an interesting look at human nature and the way some people perceive love.With a film this ambitious there tends to be a few draw backs. The only real, noticeable down side here is in its pacing. For the most part the film moves at a great pace but there are multiple spots where the film certainly slows down. Whether it's for one reason or another is beside the point. It's just abundantly clear that there are scenes where the film slows down way to much.This is a fairly small gripe in a film that overall, is great. It's so strange and unconventional that it's near impossible not to fall in love with it. It shows the world in a hilariously dark and uncompromising way. What it lacks in accessibility it makes for with rich rewards for patient viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Nihlistic. emotionally numb film, with scenes of cruelty and torture","The first 30 minutes of the movie is interesting -- with strange scenes introducing the hotel where you MUST meet your soul mate or be turned into an animal. However: later in the movie there are scenes of terrible cruelty.I came out of this movie feeling depressed and manipulated and I feel very strongly that there may be CIA involvement in the production of this movie. The CIA has helped produce movies before (including ""Zero Dark Thirty"") and this movie is NOT designed to entertain. It is designed to desensitize the viewer toward to suffering of others (emotional and physical) and manipulate the viewer into viewing leftover, unattached, single people as worthless and not worthy of any compassion.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Keep your hands inside the car,"I was having a really crappy day till I sat down and started watching this film. It asborbed my mind quickly and I found myself enjoying the pace and the plot very much. A few scenes seemed a little drawn out but by that stage I was too deeply intrigued by the plot to care. I just wanted to see what happened next. It reminded me vaguely of both The Sleeper (Woody Allen)I think due to the overbearing authorities and of The Hunger Games, probably due to the hunting and survival in the forest. Parts made me laugh out loud, parts made me wince and grab my boyfriends hand - and this from a devoted horror/sci-fi fan. Sometimes I was laughing at parts that made sense to me in a very personal way, I was the only one in the cinema laughing at those points; it really does make you think.I was left afterwards with a feeling that I'll not forget in a long time. I don't think I would want to watch it over and over but give it a few years and I'll probably end up buying it as I imagine it'll never be shown on TV; it's a bit too weird for that.Just relax and let this film take you on a strange journey.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A masterful exploration of the pursuit of love in the current digital landscape,"Some movies strike such a singular chord in your heart, that you feel they were made exclusively for you. For me, ""The Lobster"" is such a movie.This marks Yorgos Lanthimos first English language film, but don't worry. It's just as uncompromising and delightfully weird as his other features, namely ""Dogtooth"" and ""Alps"". The film is set in a dystopian future, where everyone must have a romantic partner, otherwise they are sent to the Hotel, in order to acquire one in a maximum allotted time of 45 days. If they fail to do so, the unlucky loners are transformed into an animal of their choosing and sent out to live in the wilderness. David is one such bachelor and the film follows his quest for a partner.I write a ""partner"", because that truly is the purpose of the Hotel. The people in charge aren't interested in some romantic notion of true love or anything like that. The guests must partner up with someone who is an empirical match with them; whether they both suffer from sudden nose bleeds, have poor eye sight, or even a limp, they must somehow be physically compatible. Lanthimos brings us immediately his incisive satire, exploring to an extreme the social expectations of dating in the current online landscape; where you swipe endlessly to the left until you find that one person whose mere looks just click. The way Lanthimos exposes society's conventions, by pushing the concept to its extreme is what makes ""The Lobster"" a humorous but also incredibly violent film.""If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever.""The future in this film isn't unlike the one George Orwell described above. It operates in an artificial world, drained of human emotion. Most characters search for a partner, but only out of self-preservation. It is when David begins to experience true love, that Lanthimos masterfully explores the struggle of nurturing true affection in the current oppressive digital age. David reveals himself alive for the first time, distinguishing himself from all others, and those who don't remain indifferent react with violence.I won't reveal just how far the violence in ""The Lobster"" escalates, but the ending is in perfect Lanthimos fashion, leaving you fulfilled but grasping at your seat. There are still quite a few films from 2015 that I am eager to see, but, as of now, ""The Lobster"" is my favorite of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Ti einai afto pou to lene agapi"".","Yorgos Lanthimos is definitely the most popular contemporary Greek auteur and his films have all been well-received by the global audiences and critics as well. He began as a video clip and TV commercials director while he created his first feature film, Kinetta, in 2005. Nevertheless, Lanthimos's first major success that put him in the spotlight was Dogtooth, a daring allegory focusing on family relationship dynamics and their effects on the individual. Domestic oppression, free will or the lack of it, and distortion of reality through the misuse of language were the central themes in this compelling movie which has been nominated for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year in the 2011 Oscar Awards. Furthermore, Dogtooth signified the beginning of a thriving collaboration between Lanthimos and screenwriter Efthimis Filippou, a partnership that delivered some of the most intriguing movies of the following decade. The Lobster is a 2015 production in which Lanthimos and Filippou exceed themselves and present a monumental parable about the nature of love set in a dystopian alternative universe where a tyranny of companionship dominates the people and forces them to mate with a fellow human. The inventive storyline is combined with a well-paced plot that moves forward handily and stunning photography that grips the audience from the beginning until the end. The cast is excellent with Colin Farell, who would also participate in Lanthimos's later film, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, in the role of David, a timid man who struggles to survive in an absurd world where the fate of each person is decided by an omnipotent system which possesses supernatural powers. Farell's portrayal of David is measured and consistent, building a character who lacks any heroic dimension, while at the same time retaining the characteristics that define him as a human such as fear, compassion, or even cruelty.Being a single, middle-aged man, David is arrested and sent to an institution where he has to stay for a defined period of time in order to mate with a woman. The punishment for not succeeding at this simple task is his transformation into an animal of his own liking. David's choice is a lobster because they live for over 100 years, he has blue blood, like aristocrats, and is fertile for as long as he lives. He is accompanied by a dog, his brother who couldn't manage to find a partner so he suffered the consequences. The institution's director has set strict rules for all the guests/prisoners who can extend their abidance by hunting the loners, a group of people living in the nearby woods who don't conform to the existing status quo and choose to live by their own rules. David will soon get acquainted with several people who share his predicament and he will attempt to approach a woman who seemingly has no feelings about anyone or anything. The result of this relationship will be dreadful and the protagonist will have no other solution but to escape the institution and live as a loner.In Lanthimos's fictional universe, humans are defined by their deficiencies. There is the woman with the nosebleeds, the man with a limp foot, the heartless woman, the blind woman, and so on. These imperfections are central to the construction of the peoples' identity and determine their choice of a possible partner. Shared life means shared pain. Thus, several people try to imitate the defects of the others during their stay in the institution, even if it is a lie. It is the only way to attract the attention of their prospective mates and they also know that the alternative is their conversion into an animal with all that it entails. It is a desperate situation, one that forces people to behave in ways that they couldn't imagine. When David joins the loners he quickly comprehends that the suffocating rules that made him escape from the institution are also present there. He is not allowed to have sex with another person, only to masturbate alone, and every form of companionship is prohibited in this new environment. His romantic entanglement with the short-sighted woman, played by Rachel Weisz, is now interpreted as a rebellious act of defiance against the new rules rather than a submission to the dominant norm.The cinematography is sublime and fits the story perfectly. In the first part, we are witnessing the everyday life in the institution, a place that looks like a luxury hotel while in the second one, we are transferred to the much more primitive landscape where the loners live. This contrast of scenery adds up to an overall polarized feeling that is exuded from the story due to its bizarre foundation. In a way, the second part of The Lobster constitutes an inversion of the first one, an opposite image that enhances and magnifies the importance of the love story that lies in the center of the film. The use of music furnishes the story even further and I was particularly moved by the presence of two greek songs, ""Apo mesa pethamenos"" performed by Danae Stratigopoulou and, of course, ""Ti einai afto pou to lene agapi"" by Tonis Maroudas and Sophia Loren. As a Greek, I am proud that a director of this caliber is a compatriot of mine and I feel the same about the screenwriter, Efthimis Filippou, who wrote a story of unprecedented beauty and craftsmanship. Lanthimos has established his name as the greatest living Greek auteur and his movies are always something different, transcendent visual experiences that are bound to make the audiences think and feel intensely",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Blows its load in the first half,"Exactly what the title says. The film comes out swinging with an interesting premise, but fails to keep its momentum all the way through. It honestly felt like I was watching two different films in one sitting. The first half kept the pace with interesting moment to moment situations between characters. This was due to the intriguing environment they were in. However, the second half completely abandons this interesting setting, and veers into a vastly different direction. Imagine if the characters in Squid Game escaped the game and hide for the rest of the show. That would've killed all its momentum. It's sad to say, but with a better second half, this film could've been something special.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Wonderfully odd, and superbly made in all regards","Having previously watched filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos' outstanding 'Dogtooth,' I was prepared for a peculiar experience, but assumptions can only get one so far. Narration provided by Rachel Weisz, and the bone dry, sardonic performances and sense of humor remind of the pictures of Wes Anderson, while stringent, often discordant music lends an air of disquiet. Thematic content is so heavily accentuated that I wonder if I'm not misreading the feature as the film plainly skewers society's overemphasis on couples, and how in many ways these pairings are themselves highly regimented. If not quite so decisively, single life is similarly parodied with pronounced exaggeration of the expectations placed on loners. Never outright funny, yet pointedly so, 'The lobster' is nonetheless highly entertaining throughout, uniquely mesmerizing in its absurdities.The screenplay concocted between director Lanthimos with writing partner Efthymis Filippou is truly marvelous. Whether one is assessing the dialogue, characters, scene writing, or overall narrative - or even just the very concept - 'The lobster' is rich, considered with utmost thoughtful care, and deeply engrossing. In every possible regard the movie is full of robust detail; nothing was too small to be folded into the wonderfully odd picture. Such incredible ideas round out every aspect, and Lanthimos and Filippou are to be applauded. The direction is just as sound, though, with a practiced hand and keen eye building excellent scenes, guiding great performances, and capturing every subtlety and nuance there is to be had. And ""nuance"" is perhaps a key word here, for as overtly as the themes are presented, the film's approach to storytelling and film-making consciously condenses the cast into displays of acting that are generally forcefully restrained. Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Olivia Colman, Léa Seydoux, and everyone else are terrific in their roles, and with the slant here necessarily exhibit their range and poise only with purposefully, heavily subdued expression. It's strange, but absolutely brilliant.'The lobster' is a slice of cinematic bizarrerie that's fantastically clever, and smart, and conjured and executed perfectly in all ways. Even so, for all that - the biting, nearly deadpan style it adopts is certainly going to be off-putting for some viewers; it is perhaps an acquired taste. However, anyone receptive to its distinct flavors is in for a great time, with fabulous writing, direction, and performances bringing to life a delightfully curious feature. I anticipated enjoying this, but the story took directions I hadn't imagined, and I'm glad for the surprise. Lanthimos once again demonstrates his mastery of film-making, and wherever you're able to watch 'The lobster,' this is well worth two hours of your time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

An amazing masterpiece.,"Young Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, who is commonly known as the award winning Greek movie Kynodontas, is the director of this amazing movie.Movie is about a man named David, who was left by his wife. He gets placed to a hotel with other single people like him. If those single people can not find a lover in 45 days, they are transformed into an animal of their choice. Since it is about a single man who is looking for love, i recommend this movie especially to the single people.Audience that are familiar with the director's previous works like Kynodontas and Alpeis will enjoy the similar absurd figures and elements in this movie. This interesting, unusual progress of the plot keeps the viewer focused and wonder what is next to come.Viewers that are not familiar with the dark humour or uninterested in the detailed dialogs might find the movie a little bit strange at first. For those, my suggestion would be to watch Kynodontas (Dogtooth) before this movie. This will help them focus on the progress of the movie and dialogs rather than the dystophian setting and intentionally enchanted, unusual dialogs. Compared to the ""Kynodontas"", ""The Lobster"" is a lot more complex in dialogs and plot and includes hidden clues about character personas and has more artistic features.""The Lobster"" is for those who likes to sit and think about the movie and its point when the movie ends. The movie does not give the audience a clear message or conclusion to feed the viewer. It aims to make the viewer rethink about the whole movie when it ends and discover it himself/herself.Finally, this is one of the best movies i have ever watch. ""The Lobster"" might not be for everyone, but if you are even a little bit into viewer centered movies, just get yourself ready for a 2 hours of both artistic and entertaining movie which will make you think about it for hours or days when it ends.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Think about it. It would be absurd.""","Just saw this movie, and what can I say. Absurd, as it is said in the film (and in the quote above), is one of the first words that comes into my mind. Grotesque, but stylistically confident. Maybe the most macabre and morbid movie about Love I have ever seen. And yes, this film is about Love. From the utterly weirdest perspective you can imagine. The actors transport this well-written and inspired screenplay so straight in the visitors face, so that the weirdest scenes made me laugh the most in this movie. Colin Farrell might remind you of Joaquin Phoenix in ""Her"", not only because of the similar mustache they share. But where ""Her"" (which I also liked very much, what's funny because I'm not a fan of Love-stories at all) wanted to be deep and sad, this film holds on to his crazy and brilliant idea and unfolds its highly and numerously funny elements due to his consequence. And all of it yet came totally unexpected. Still the center of the movie is thoughtful. What value does Love have in our todays world? What are we making of it and how do we transform ourselves by doing so? The sobriety of that world and its characters is captured brilliantly by the steady camera-shots and the rather mealy colors of the films landscapes. The music underlines the grotesqueness of what's going on, creating a feeling of uncomfortableness as the story moves forwards to its eerie end.The originality of the storyboard alone is enough to fascinate; but the outworking and cogency makes this movie a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Middle-aged Alternate Reality to the Hunger Games,"8 of 10. Alternate reality really needs to become as big a film term as sci-fi. Neither Hunger Games nor this are truly sci-fi, but they are definite alternate realities that could exist here and now or in the not too distant future or past.If you want to test if someone you know actually understands and appreciates the Hunger Games, not just a fan-girl/boy riding the bandwagon, this is the film to watch with them. If they don't appreciate the sort of dropped in the middle of a seemingly modern world and the mystery of what's actually happening and what's actually real along with the allegorical similarities, they simply have no clue.This probably will never be a teen sensation. The people, with a few exceptions, are mostly unappealing, either physically or emotionally, and middle-aged. In place of action, there is comedy, mostly satirical. Rather than visual oddities, the normal is turned into the bizarre and you're always waiting for the other shoe to drop.Definitely a film worthy of a sequel.

One of the best films of 2016,"The Lobster is one of the most realistic depictions in satire of relationships nowadays. It never takes a side but let's you choose for yourself. Most people will laugh at the ingenious satire and come out of it a bit happy but reflecting on what happened in the film. Others will watch this and think of it as one of the darkest films they've seen because of how it hits the nail on the perception of what others think people need to be happy.The Lobster stars Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Lea Seydoux, John C. Reilly and Ben Whishaw in a dark dystopian comedy where people who are single go to and hook up with someone. If they don't then they become an animal of their choice. This is by far the weirdest movie of 2016. What makes it even more hilarious is how everyone acts normal like this just happens to everyone. The dry humor becomes extremely messed up to a point. To some it might be excessive but it never goes beyond a point. There was a part in the movie that was so dark I had to pause the movie and think about what just happened. It's plot feels stiff but in a playful way that fits with the characters.Colin Farrell hasn't had the greatest time recently. While I love the actor he's gotten a lot of criticism for his recent role in True Detective Season 2. While I personally really liked Season 2 (That's for another time.) and can see the flaws the best part of Season 2 was by far Colin Farrell. Farrell is great in this film. This is probably his best role since In Bruges. He plays a character that is a mix of Takashi Shimura's character in Ikiru and Bill Murray's character in Lost in Translation. Farrell plays the character brilliantly. He plays his character with an almost emotionless tone. While some say that this is pretty bad acting really it shows how desensitized the people are in this world. Yorgos Lanthimos is known for direct his actors in a very stifled way. It works as it shows the desensitized world the characters live in.The Lobster is one of the best films of 2016. It's dystopian setting had traces of 1984 and helps shine on how relationships are treated so black and white in the real world. If you don't find the film hilarious or funny you'll find a great drama about a man's inner turmoil with his life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too silly to make an impact,"""The Lobster"" does have a satisfying oddness to it.

"A ""Dogtooth"" fan's review of ""The Lobster""","The Lobster is a love story as revealing and disturbing to an adult as ""Romeo and Juliet"" is to a child.One should absolutely get past the silliness of the situation (which is there for a reason), and he will be rewarded with a ""scientific"" description of love.The Lobster script is thoroughly developed and describes all the subtle shadings of emotions that border love.As father would say:There are two distinct groups of emotions that border love (if it exists).The first group of emotions that border love (if it exists), are in random order:Group A1.hatred2.revenge3.guilt4.jealousy5.pity and6.fearThe second group of emotions that border love (if it exists) are in random order:Group B1.companionship2.sexual attraction3.friendship4.acceptance and5.belonging6. survivalThe average of both groups A and B are of equal distance to love L (AL=AB). Please calculate the distance between love L and each individual emotion and provide examples from the movie ""The Lobster""...Father aside, The Lobster deconstructs both the ""forced"" love of the hotel as well as the ideal of the ""Romeo and Juliet"" love and deliberately avoids taking sides. If only, through it's factual approach, it promotes tolerance or at least respect for the personal pain people go through to achieve what they think is their ideal...The brilliance of the movie is that it avoids being clinical which is strange. It is completely emotionally engaging and touching in a very deep way. It manages to be so, avoiding any clichés in actor's performances, script or direction. It does so instead through subtlety and omission..., which I find striking.As you probably guessed by now, I'm totally thrilled about this movie and I totally sympathize with the decision of the distribution company to market it to a modern mainstream audience as a science fiction romantic comedy...The only science fiction I can see is in the demands it makes on it's viewers and it can only be a comedy in the minds of it's emotionally crippled audience.All of the above is of-course my personal opinion. This movie is more than anything else, a test of yourself.I could go on forever about ""The Lobster"" but I have to get back to my fathers' car trunk.Cheers Nikitas",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"weird wave strikes again with the "" Irish Dogtooth""","As a Greek myself , I'd like very much to have positive feedback for this film.I had seen Dogtooth with great effort not to turn the thing off , only because I had a sense of respect for the Director and I felt obliged to at least finish the damn film.However I did have a feeling that Lanthimos is an -above average- Director.So I gave "" the lobster "" a fresh try. I hoped this "" weird wave "" thing would be gone , and perhaps we'll get a good dystopian sci-fi from a masterful Director.Sadly, this wasn't the case. The ""weird wave"" continues adamantly.There is no character development , there is no insight to the dystopian set up , there is no science fiction.There is only the weird. The acting is buried and we are presented with the bizarre script ,the scenery and the baroque soundtrack to add some ""quality spice"".There is no entertainment in this film , each minute passed very slowly , and frankly , I was embarrassed on behalf of Colin Farrell and those other fine actors /actresses playing these ""roles"".Was there even a point? Does it raise Big questions on relationships and couples and society? Was it Political?I failed to see any of these hints in the film. It was just weird and bad.I must say that , again , I do see that Lanthimos -can be- a good director. But since a director is the supreme maestro of a film , the man most responsible for the outcome , after such a film I cannot say that he is a good director. Only that he can be , or he might be , perhaps if he abandons his "" style "". So let's hope he doesn't remain faithful to it and his next film is free of the ugly weirdness and focuses more on character and fun.1/10 (the film is borderline unwatchable)",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Satirical Dystopian Literary Work!,"I can't think of any movie that has effortlessly explored the human relationships with such insight, profundity, authenticity, and accuracy. Lanthimos simply took some stereotypes and utilized them flawlessly, thus taking advantage of them in a most potent, effective, and cynical way. I don't the movie to be neither misanthropic nor nihilistic, since it displays both the good and the bad in humans. This is one of these movies that makes you wonder why it hasn't been made before.The Lobster also has one of the most effective uses of voice-over narration in recent years. With a stiff and composed tone lacking emotional weight, the voice-over significantly enriches the film's narrative, particularly for setting its gloomy and dreary tone that seems as if it came out of a dystopian novel, and it's definitely crucial to carry the film's development from start to finish.It's also impressive that both different halves of the movie have worked pretty well; the first half, with its sarcastic and dry sense of humor, and the second half, with its more serious, focused and extremely intelligent less-is-more storytelling. The movie almost scuppered by the major tonal shift between its two halves, and became very tepid, since its humor lost its bite almost completely. But it picked up almost instantly, and became as, if not more, intriguing and riveting as it was in its first hour.An instant classic, The Lobster is a highly original dystopian black comedy that proves that Yorgos Lanthimos is one of the most talented and idiosyncratic filmmakers working today.

"Postmodern absurdist garbage that masqerades as ""truth""","The Lobster is a revolting, dull and unfunny film that attempts to be funny (in a blatantly ironic & satirical way) by employing deliberately stilted dialogue delivery and awkward scenes that sometimes present outright disgusting cruelty/gore. As the main theme of the film is to make a mockery out of modern human forms of communications & relationships this is understandable, but it falls like a limp, smelly half-dead fish that flops hopelessly on the sand in the hopes of trying to elicit attention from it's audience.The idea that this is a film about the social conformity and the pressures of marriage and monogamous relationships is typical of a postmodern mindset that arrogantly rejects any kind of stability whatsoever. Besides, is this really a critique of the modern world? Is this really a film about how suffocating monogamous relationships are? If so, it seems to be a film about the pressures of the 20th century rather than the 21st since an increasing amount of people live alone than ever. The question is then: Why does The Lobster seek to satirise such a thing? One answer is partly because it is a film devoted to a specifically air-headed sort of person who lives a fairly modest if not boring state of existence, both in their social and ""professional"" lives. Of course, you can debate as much as you want about what ""The Lobster"" is about, which really shows how completely pretentious and, at the same time, vacuous it really is.Of course, all this is seen by people who admire the film as very intelligent and daring because, as well all know, laughing at modern existential suffering of humans in the form of presenting scenes full of crude and violent symbology is apparently hilarious - if you're someone with an anti-social, psychopathic or sociopathic mindset, that is. All the scenes are typical of the symbology of an arm-chair psychologist. It seems to make the overall point that people do irrational things - out of fear of loneliness - to belong in society. It screams out: ""This is what we all do.""Ultimately, it is a film that presents a presumptuous and misanthropic view of ""all"" human beings with the exception of the arrogant admirations of the ""one"" person watching and lapping up the self-indulgent narrative of the film. The fact that this is categorised as ""comedy"" only reflects the overall sadomasochistic nature of The Lobster.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The absurdity of modern relationships.,"4 / 5 - I enjoyed this film more than I was expecting to enjoy it. I think the first half of the film is way better than the second one, that drags for too long a little bit. The film is a great example of absurd storytelling to magnify little aspects of our lives. It is through the lens of the absurdity that we will exam relationship in our modern society.In this dystopian near future all single people are forced to go through a 45 day process to find a romantic partner or they will be transformed into beasts and sent off into the woods.It is quite a simple premise and through this we are forced to reflect how we see relationships and our own image projected to society. In the movie, characters are described through one single feature, and they need to find a match on this singularity on another person in order to form a couple. It is interesting how this, which should simplify everything, actually make things even trickier. And how much absurd is this when we also dictate specific features that we look on other people and if someone is far off our standards we usually won't relate to the person at all?The film itself is good, great shots, photography, acting, soundtrack (including a Nick Cave mention).Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Mastepiece Lobsterpiece!,"Please do not get clawstrophobic with my pun-filled review of the masterpiece independent film ""The Lobster"". I just don't sea, I mean see, a better movie coming out this year than ""The Lobster"". Director Yorgos Lanthimos has yorgone where few directors have gone to with his apex originality, creativity, and quirkiness of this gem of a film. ""The Lobster"" stars an excellent Colin Farrell as David. His wife has just left him, and has to go to a hotel where they provide you 45 days to find a new mate. The rules of this futuristic dystopian society is that if mating is not made within 45 days, then the guests are transformed into an animal of their choice. David selects a Lobster because he loves the sea, they live to more than 100 years old, they are blue-blooded like aristocrats, and they always remain fertile! I have been saying this for years!!! At the hotel, David befriends two other male guests; a lisping quasi-looney dude, and an abrasive limping man. There are unorthodox occurrences that occur in the hotel that will leave you flabbergasted; either with bitter disgust because of its unconventionality or with cinematic euphoria due to its originality; I was hit wit the latter. So yea, ""The Lobster"" is not for everyone to stomach. Rachel Weisz co-stars as the Short Sighted Woman, she is part of The Loners; a guerrilla-type group that guests in the hotel must hunt on. Consequently, David and the Short Sighted Woman meet and then the film becomes an insightful love story like you have never seen before; from near or far. Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou's screenplay of ""The Lobster"" was a clawsic case of delight! It's as inventive as they come! I will boil with anger if ""The Lobster"" screenplay is not nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar nomination during next year's award season! Moreover, Lanthimos also better land plenty of Best Director nominations for his phenomenal direction of the picture. Farrell has never been better, it is the best performance of his career with his perfect work as David. Also sensational was John C. Reilly as the Lisper and Ben Whishaw as the Limper. I also envision Weisz with much award accolade for her perfect performance as the short sighted woman. Other Lobster kudos acting feeds also go to Lea Seydoux as the Loner Leader, Angeliki Paupolia as the Heartless Woman, Ashley Jensen as the Biscuit Woman, Jessica Barden as the Nosebleed Woman, and Olivia Colman as the Hotel Manager. The Acting Lobsemble here is as good as it gets! So yes, I am a ""The Lobster"" lover, and it has clawed its way to my cinematic tops! ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

All are obviously capable of doing excellent work, it is just irritating to watch a film that is bad on purpose. It isn't arty or clever or anything, it's just bad. Some members of the crew appear to have accidentally done their jobs well, the film is often beautiful; it just isn't worth watching.And it isn't 'dystopian' either (enough of that already!)

What animal do you want to be?,"""The Lobster"" is a darkly comedic masterpiece that dissects the absurdities of modern social roles with a chillingly satirical edge. Set in a dystopian society where single people are forcibly confined to a hotel with 45 days to find a suitable partner or face transformation into an animal, the film plunges us into a world of bizarre dating rituals and the suffocating pressure of conformity.Colin Farrell delivers a career-best performance as David, a man grappling with the absurdity of his situation. The supporting cast are equally brilliant, imbuing their eccentric characters with a deadpan humor that perfectly mirrors the film's surreal tone.The film is visually stunning with a meticulously crafted aesthetic that blends sterile minimalism with unexpected bursts of vibrant color. The dialogue, sharp and witty, is delivered with a robotic detachment that underscores the film's underlying critique of societal expectations and the performative nature of relationships.Lanthimos masterfully blends humor and horror, creating a disquieting atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll leaving you with a thought-provoking and unforgettable cinematic experience that will stay with you long after you've left the theater. It's a film that challenges our assumptions about love, loneliness, and the pressure to conform.The best part is the director leaves the ending deliberatly obscure to allow you to decide what you would do in David's situation.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A dreadful film which shouldn't exist,"Thinking that his wife no longer loves him, a man is sent to a hotel where he must find a partner within 45 days or be turned into an animal of his choice.Although it sounded like a good idea, this movie turned out to be a completely different animal than what I was expecting. It portrays a series of events, taken by a couple of characters which seem to be completely retarded. Whatever they do, even the most basic acts, like speaking, seems awkward, stupid and even sometimes degrading. The events which occur seem to lead nowhere, thus making it as boring as hell, very slow paced and ultimately pointless.While it manages to keep you focused for a whopping 10 minutes, it simply loses grip thanks to its idiotic and senseless plot, not to mention the completely retarded characters. It's a very bad movie which simply insults your intelligence, presents absolutely nothing while it was supposed to draw a smile on your face every once in a while. I'm very surprised that this kind of abominations receive such large acclaims and to say that it was an Oscar nominee makes matters even worse.I cannot tell you how much I regret the time wasted with this nonsense. Furthermore, I simply cannot understand how the two main actors, Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, for whom I have high appreciation, decided to accept such dreadful roles in such a bad movie.

This movie stayed in the premise but the audience was never told why the premise existed in the first place, why certain ""rules"" were instigated and why most of the things that happened happened.

Simply put - this movie is boring,"I decided to write a review on this movie for the sake of ranting and to (hopefully) inform people about it. Everything checked out about this movie - yet it was awful. I'm taking matters into my own hands. The fact is that the characters are emotionless or at least they suppress their emotions. It's a dystopian world they live in and society has everyone's lifestyle and behavior programmed. There are a lot of slow motion scenes and unnecessarily so. Those were particularly dull and hard to focus on. Many scenes were unnecessary, lingering way too long on the same thing.I often felt my attention drifting away and I actually had to make an effort to register what was going on. The dialogue is monotonous, full of intervals of silence yet abrupt. The music was awful, deliberately weird and out of place I think. There's a specific thundering sequence that was so unbelievably annoying and repetitive that my friend and I laughed about it. The ending was indefinite and the most boring of all. I was indifferent to the Lobster and that's how it left me feeling as well. Indifferent to everything except the time I wasted preparing to watch this movie and watching it.

"Surreal, Absurd, Endearing & Funny; THE LOBSTER is a Bizarre One I Highly Recommend","The latest film I can obsessively recommend to my friends, knowing they'll probably never watch it, is THE LOBSTER. I think I first took notice of it when Cracked mentioned it in an article on (then) upcoming insane movies that weren't getting enough attention and the plot synopsis demanded I track down this movie and watch it as soon as I could. In THE LOBSTER, Colin Farrell is a man who is recently single and must attend a program wherein he has 45 days to find a new mate or he will be turned into an animal. He chooses as his potential future animal a lobster because of their long life, blue blood, and lifetime of fertility. The film, from Greek writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos, is set in a dystopian world where relationships are government- regulated and loners, those who manage to escape their transformative fate, are outcasts that live in the forests. People attending the resort in search of a mate can extend their time through a hunting ritual where they're released into the woods with tranquilizer guns to hunt the loners, garnering additional days for every loner they bring in for transformation. The film chronicles the desperation of our main character David (Farrell) as he does whatever he can to find a new connection before accepting more drastic measures and going the route of a fugitive loner, where he happens to meet a lovely woman (Rachel Weisz) who might in fact be his ideal mate, assuming they get out alive.THE LOBSTER is a surreal gem of a film that I can't seem to shake from my mind for a while after watching it. There's just so much here to break down and examine. I'm obsessed with the strange world that Lanthimos and co- writer Efthymis Filippou have created. We've got this bizarre world where the government mandates that everyone must have a mate to the point where, if authorities see you wandering a city alone, they can demand to see your papers verifying your relationship status. There's a strange recurring theme where you can only exist as either end of a spectrum with no gray area in between. For example, in addition to the outright relationship vs. loner existence, there's a moment at the beginning of the film where David is partaking in the resort's entrance exam and he's asked his sexual orientation. He claims as heterosexual but then admits he had engaged in some experimentation at a point earlier in life and wanted to know if he could be labeled bisexual but, no, this isn't allowed (there is some mention that this had caused some complications within the program at some point in the past). Each society exists by a strict set of rules that operate as polar opposites; masturbation at the resort will get your hand mauled whereas making out in the loner tribe will scar you with the ""red kiss"". It's all so strange and infinitely interesting with a hint of vague social commentary on relationships within.I find it difficult to make a case for people to check out THE LOBSTER. If you're not as intrigued by the strange world Lanthimos and Filippou have created as I am, you might find the movie dull. It's got a very dry sense of humor and all of the dialogue is delivered in a flat, matter-of-fact manner with little or no emotion with few exceptions. The characters are almost robotic in their behavior and the only ones who come across as near-human are David and Weisz's short-sighted woman. There's another strange element: Farrell's David is the only character in the entire movie with a name. Everyone else is defined by a trait. Weisz is short-sighted. John C. Reilly has a lisp. Ben Wishaw has a limp. The characters populating the world of THE LOBSTER define themselves by one outstanding trait and seek their mate based on that trait, to the point that some will even fake it just to avoid transformation; even when not trapped in the ""civilized"" world, David desperately seeks that shared trait with the short-sighted woman to feel secure in his affections for her. I find more to love about this quirky little film the more I mull it over in my mind and I'm sure there's an audience for this sort of oddity out there but I know it could very well be off-putting for a lot of people. It's surreal, absurd, funny, and endearing, and now I kind of want to watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
We are currently living in similar dystopia,"I just watched this movie today, after watching ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" by the same director, Yorgos Lanthimos, and also featuring Colin Farrell.Lanthimos makes movies in the same genre as Stanley Kubrick (most notably ""The Shining"" and ""Clockwork Orange."").In movies that touch topics like dystopia and humanity and its vices, this one is one of those that I usually sit and think about by a window with a nice hot cup of coffee.Throughout human history, we as species, are smart enough to think up rules of how we live among one another, but sometimes are very dumb as to think of the logic of why those rules exist. Most rules are made up by usually of one man or one group who happen to think it, and for the rest of history, it stays as a rule. Examples include, why do Hindus not eat cow (beef)? Why did the Salem Witch Hunt occur; how about the Spanish Inquisition? How did Joseph McCarthy come into power? Why can't a family unit consist of two women or two men raising a child? What are the consequences of one-child policy of China today? Or how about the idea that humans need to carry on their family name while wishing for a son. All of them because one man or group of men, thought it might make sense (at that time.) But I repeat myself.Those are the crazy questions that come about in real world, as the fictional world of the Lobster is just as crazy. I assume your parents have always asked you, when are you gonna get married and bring me a grandchild. Everyone probably has a crazy uncle or traveling aunt who never married. Remember the term, spinsters, alluding to a stereotype of an older woman who is unmarried, childless, prissy, and repressed. Those are the exact goals of the dystopia world of David, where you need to be a coupled or otherwise you are useless to this world, and we rather have you be useful as an animal.But besides thinking of crazy rules for 7 billions human beings to follow, the movie also brings out the dysfunctionality of rules that are to be followed by what we today call the Government, or the state. Crazy ideas at one time about slavery, sitting in back of buses, not sharing drinking fountains, no free speech for certain people, but just as much free hate speech for others, diversity and tolerance only for those who agree with you, etc.The movie shows that on either side (the left or the right) there is dysfunction. The two groups, the hotel runs it like a prison, where masturbation gets your hands burned; and when you get away free, the Loners has its own set of ridiculous rules to follow, like no flirting. At the mall, there's the set of rules where you need to have your papers (like drivers licence or passport) with you at all times. Humans are ridiculous, in deed and indeed.We are currently living in a dystopian world right now, where Trump is capitalizing on people's craziness for bias, double standard, false news reported as truth, and resistance. Just as dystopia was when certain group thought Jews deserve to be burned in ovens.We are living in a dystopia and not even know it. That's what the Lobster is trying to say.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Must C!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sheer waste of time,As a confirmed movie buff I am usually fascinated and appreciative of most celluloid excursions. The opening scene of this movie has a scene that sums up my thoughts about The Lobster. A woman is driving in a dreary atmosphere alone on an endless road. She stops and gets out where there are 3 donkeys. Walks up to one of them and shoots it dead.I felt as frustrated as that woman on watching this meandering excuse of a story and wished the director could have been shot to avoid the creation of this pathetic 2 hours of time waste. Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz are wasted here. Best avoid. Movie ends suddenly. There is a time in the movie when dialogues go from English to French with no sub titles. Like i said... do avoid this.,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delicious and Crazy,"This odd movie was the one of the best things this year. Colin Farrell stars in this highly original movie that is an allegory for relationships. He is one of many single people who have 45 days at a hotel to make a match for marriage or they will be turned into whatever animal they choose. Our main character chooses a lobster. This is from the same awesome madman who directed ""Dogtooth"". The images are beautiful, the humor is dark and weird and the performances are great across the board. This is definitely a movie you will not know what is going to happen next. Oh how wonderful it is to still have those movies.. It's best to know next to nothing going on and I have given you very little. Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst!! Boring!! Avoid at all costs..,"This movie is so freaking bad that I am compelled to write the first review of my life. The only thing that made me watch this movie was the rating (don't know if the raters were hallucinating). I thought maybe there will be a point in the movie that will justify the ratings. But nope. The movie is full of garbage, stupidity and weirdness from the beginning to the end. It seems as if the makers of the movie were short on budget. They have tried to think of some new concept but I am afraid the plot as a whole is bleak. The acting was not that bad but the movie in itself was awfully horrible. I was hoping to have an enjoyable time but rather I am hating myself for watching this crap and wasting my time. My suggestion - Avoid at all costs!!!!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A totally fresh and original film,"Tired of seeing the same old boring drivel over and over again? Want to watch something new and original? Check out The Lobster. You will not be disappointed. This film feels totally fresh. It takes place in a world that looks similar to our own but which we soon discover is vastly different than anything any of us may have experienced. It's more like a strange dream or a nightmare, and every minute of it is full of fun.The story—which deals with a divorced man who is staying at a hotel where single people hope to meet a significant other or else be turned into an animal of their choosing—is totally unpredictable and leaves us on the edge of our seat in nervous anticipation. Then, halfway through, just when we think we know what's going to happen next, it takes a huge turn and we're off on the next leg of our adventure. Then it takes another turn and then another. It builds in excitement and intensity—and insanity—right up until the end, and before we know it the two hours have gone by in what feels like half the time. And the ending is amazing. I didn't even see it coming until thirty seconds beforehand and I couldn't help but smile as it unfolded.The characters and the story are bizarre and unreal, nothing like real life, but that's what is so good about it. Even their speech patterns are strange, which makes the voice-over narration all the more enjoyable and ridiculous. At first it feels like bad acting but then we get used to it and then we start to love it. But it's not by any means dumb comedy. On the contrary, it's very smart and deliberate in what it does. And this film has a spectacular sense of humor that is all its own and which stems from these bizarre and unique characters.At one point, the character played by John C. Reilly in perhaps his finest role, stares in bewilderment at man who asks him if he's ever danced before. After several awkward seconds, Reilly replies, quite matter-of-factly and with a lisp, ""Yes,"" only to then be asked what kind of dancing he did. Frustrated and still confused, Reilly sighs and responds: ""It depends on the music."" It's hilarious because it's exactly what the character should say but not what we would ever expect him to say. And the film is full of wonderful moments such as this, all dry and all hilarious.The writing and acting are exceptional and unlike anything I've ever seen before. It's been said that there are only seven or eight stories, each being told over and over again in different ways. But The Lobster seems to defy that statement. I can't think of any other movie or story to compare this to. This is truly a one-of-a-kind film and I feel it will develop a huge lasting legacy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Different  type of film a parody and allegory of humans and animals that's tied to finding love.,"""The Lobster"" is certainly a different film one that's a little tough and difficult to watch still it's theme is a parody allegory between humans and animals still it's entertains and the concept on finding love is neat it would really be crazy if it was like this in the real world. This picture is set in the near future and it stars Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, and John C. Reilly as the film is a funny romance that involves sex, and lust while the search for love is a must happen. Centered around David(Colin Farrell)a recently divorced man who's search for love is in a 45 day time limit, and the bad news is if he's still single he will be turned into a lobster now wow! And along the way the scenes of humans and animals is portrayed into a funny watch and the sex scenes are a lustful eye full! Just imagine if real life would be this way it would have many trying to kidnap a partner and they would do whatever even if it means tying them up and gagging them(as portrayed in this film). Overall ""The Lobster"" is a different kind of film still it's message is far out, but it makes the person search for love and happiness in a different universe overall neat concept parody and allegory type film. As they say we are all animals!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Critics & snobs love films like this--audiences don't.,"That pretty well sums up my overall impression of this film, that I admittedly had high curiosity and hopes for.This is a film, like Pi, filled with many non-absorbent instances and images that culminates into nothing but stagnation, ultimately.Now, granted, one man's pretension is another man's secret identity. And I get what they were going for: They were hoping to make a dark comedy about the societal pressure to be mated, and the scarlet letter on anyone's back who is alone. That's clear in the first several short scenes. So, the film accomplished its goal before the 10 minute mark. From there, it limps to a black screen - no ending, no resolution, or even a hint at continuation. Just a feeling that they ran out of either film or ideas.This is a 'piece' about a man who checks into a resort for people who have come to their last hopes of finding a person to live their existences with. Sort of Howard's End-cum-Hotel California, in that no one can leave, and everyone only speaks once an hour in a monotone. The gist is that if they don't find a mate, they turn into a member of the animal kingdom. 'OK, not a bad idea, they could go somewhere with this...' I so naively think to myself after the first 4 minutes. And from there, we have the parade of statues: Characters introduced as fellow residents and meant to bring some humanity in the form of interaction. They forgot, however, to give them any substance. A nosebleed isn't a 'quirk', I'm sorry. If the actors had been directed to speak in more than one timbre, and had been written dialogue that didn't amount to a ""minutes of the meeting"" memo, then maybe they could have had something.So, after some milling, the main 'character' tried to cuckold another 'character' and fails. So he leaves and finds himself embraced by another group with a separate set of standards and clothing that the group he just fled. And that about all as far as differences. The group has the same hollow, banal intonations as the people we were just tired of. And the same prattle happens all over again.This has the label of Dark Comedy. But, 'dark' does not mean colorless; and, sudden gasps at horrific snap-cut deaths & mutilations do not constitute laughter, which one expects from a comedy.As I said in the title, snobs will flock to this film because it gives them a perfect chance to say their favorite line: ""Well, you just didn't get it."" I just love hearing people say this. Why? Because it is usually said right after someone asks for their overall impression or opinion or reflections of what they just saw. I will never forget the time I saw a movie with some friend of a friend that was ... I think it might have been 'Pi'. I asked what he thought of that ending. He literally snapped his jaw up in the air and said, ""Well, if you didn't get it, I certainly won't be able to explain it to you."" I looked at him & said, ""You don't get it either, do you?"" He laughed, but he didn't deny what I said. 'The Lobster' is going to be THAT kind of film, you just watch. So many people have already said the 7-paragraph equivalent of 'You just didn't get it' already on here. I may get some in reply.Well, you know what, my gentle 'parvenu-bies'? I got it. Everyone got it, and people who see it after this will get it.Art means something different to everyone who views it; that's why film is art. And I will not dismiss this as art simply because I'm of the opinion that 'The Lobster' is the cinematic equivalent of waiting for the nurse to guide you back into the waiting room after a routine checkup.Personally, if I wanted to watch an hour and a half of culminated silence peppered with 10 minutes of flaccid dialogue, I certainly wouldn't pay for that - I'd go to an empty theater before a movie starts. It would have been a more meaningful experience.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

I Guess You Could Call it a Rom-Com,"When I look to watch a movie, the first thing I look for is a creative idea executed well to make the movie memorable and unique; and Yorgos Lanthimos delivers excellently with his 2015 film, The Lobster. This movie fits its absurdist style absolutely and asserts that relationships can be shallow and driven by our necessity to not be alone.
The general plot of this movie starts by introducing that in this world, Newly divorced David must find a wife within 45 days or face the fate of getting turned into an animal of his choice, to which he chooses a lobster based on its longevity and his fondness for the sea. To complete this impossible mission, all single people are relocated into a bleak and propagandist hotel designed to force singles into couples to conform to society. Lanthimos uses this outlandish setting to present the weak connections behind many relationships.
Lanthimos masterfully characterizes very minimally while filming in an intentionally mundane way. Lines are read choppily and shots are long with little background sound or action. But the first time watching, I could barely look away based on the sheer absurdity of the style and premise of this movie in addition to some hilarious lines and situations that arise out of the awkwardness. In a bold move by lanthimos, he chooses to not give name to any of the other characters, instead describing them by one major characteristic such as the girl who gets frequent nose bleeds, the man with the limp, the man with the lisp, or the cruel woman. The bored disengaged filming style and its creative characterization shattered every expectation that I had that one could do with a movie and kept me hooked throughout the film.
The Lobster fits very similarly to what Lanthimos has done in the past with his movie Dogtooth. In that movie the main characters are also not given names and they are confined to their house under their overprotective parents similarly to how David is confined to the relational pressure to find a companion that manifests itself in the ultimatum enforced by the blank conformity of the hotel.
Lanthimos' directing style contrasts in almost every way to what Anthony and Joe Russo did with Avengers Infinity War. The Russo brothers used every scene and a complex plot filled with colorful scenery, quick cuts, and near constant action to create an energetic movie. Lanthimos did almost everything differently and still created an interesting movie, showcasing his ability to do everything differently from a traditional Hollywood movie and it still create a success.
I have two complaints with this movie, one being the score and the other being the length of the second half of the film. The score of the movie is the same song that repeats throughout the movie, and it often feels overused. My other complaint is that certain scenes in the letter half of the movie feel long and unnecessary. There is one scene where David and the short sighted woman are walking into town. In this particular scene, the uncompromising nature of the style of the film backfires with a long dialogue less walking scene in a second half that doesn't need to be as long as it is.
Contrarily, the theme continues strongly into the second half. David, running out of time, escapes the hotel and joins the group of loners who view relationships in the opposite way. This group faces mutilation if caught with a companion. Lanthimos uses this group to flesh out the opposite end of the spectrum and hypocritical nature of how society views relationships. Lanthimos claims that society penalizes both being happily single and being in a relationship.
The true strength of this film is demonstrated in its unique setting and the style in which it is filmed. This movie stuck firmly in my memory because it is truly like nothing I have ever seen before and that is what makes it great. The film style, with its gray and muted colors creates a movie that is ironically unforgettable.
In addition to being a unique movie, this movie stays strong to its theme and provides a strong commentary on what relationships may become in the future. I will concede that this movie is not for everyone, but I will recommend it to anyone who appreciates seeing a fresh perspective taking to movie making. I'm giving The Lobster a 4/5 and I will definitely rewatch in the near future.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Most Unpleasant Experience,"There are many reviews of this film, many of them as bizarre as the film itself.To give potential viewers a realistic idea this needs to be said: It is not by any stretch of the imagination a comedy. There is not a single scene in the film that is funny at all. Most scenes are bleak and menacing.It is a Science Fiction HORROR movie which will have a most depressing effect on most viewers.

Brazenly bold and inventive cinema proves consistently rewarding to adventurous cinephiles!,"This was an odd experience, as I just recently ended a self-imposed 12-year moratorium on relationships, due to a couple of bad ones I had within a short period of time in the early 2000's. It was very intriguing to see a type of dystopia exist in which 'singledom' was so vilified to the point of actually being against the law. I would never have previously thought that such a state of events was possible, but recent trends in 'political correctedness' on the one hand and both religious and political radicalism on the other means that, sadly, nothing is impossible anymore. I thought it was a remarkable idea for a film, and both the soundtrack and cinematography were outstanding. The bizarre script and bold direction brought forth some of the best acting I have yet seen from Colin Ferrell, Rachel Weisz and John C. Reilly, as well.I'm definitely looking forward to seeing other films by this brazenly original writer/director. Long may his almost-Bunuelian take on things go forth.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't bother watching this movie.,"I started out with high expectations. Since the movie has a good IMDb rating. The society it showed was interesting, and very disturbing in its solutions for the problem of single people. But I could tolerate all until the middle of the movie. Then, a companion animal was killed in a cold-blooded fashion by a psychopath. And the owner didn't stop the action or even protest. So, I am done with this movie, that's it. It gets a 1 rating from me. I have no further interest in the rest of the movie, intriguing as it could be. It's dead to me. I'd rather watch comedies about the STASI.

The loss of love,"A fiction aligned with a context of present drama elevated to the extreme, the searches for the indenity, for someone that completes to him, and the search of the love through futilities are bad of our world to which the film portrays of a sarcastic and unique way. We have an extremely creative script, making a satire to great Hollywood films of dystopian futures like voracious games, Divergent, Maze Runner ... and mixed a black humor to the best style ""Dr. fantastic"" the script creates a world of exaggerated situations , Intelligent, with very interesting characters and very different from what we are accustomed to see. A world where everyone has to find the ""soul mate"", otherwise you will be sent to a hotel, where if you do not even find the love of your life, you will be transformed into an animal of your choice, in this context, we have Our protagonist David (Colin Farrel), who is sent to the hotel, but ends up living with the singles of the forest, a group of social renegades who live on the margins of a society subjected to love. The moral of the film aims at portraying that today we live in a gigantic emotional lack, where those who achieve it are successful and oppress the needy, because of this oppression in the search for the ideal pair, the small similarities between man and woman already Are enough to be considered couples, we live in a world to have the same taste goes beyond love, and such subtleties are portrayed in an exemplary way in the film. Technically the film has a photograph with many shades of gray, but extremely natural, with many scenes recorded in the light of day, and using many open angles, the photography is extremely cold but has an intrinsic beauty in its depression, with a good edition , An almost absence of makeup that brings a natural and transgressive beauties and an apathetic costume, we must also mention her soundtrack, the music that is rambunctious, she is melancholic with classic touches mixed with strong beats, makes the viewer feel the weight of Film, mixed the narration and black humor, the feeling caused is something unique, we do not have great highlights in the performances, because they are all caricatures, and the model of acting of the film is extra bold, as its script, we have extremely theatrical performances that help To compose even more the climate of the film, we must also mention the director yorgos lanthimos, already known by the great ""Canine Tooth"" the director has a way Extremely European and beautiful to drive, look forward to your next films. Finally ""The Lobster"" is a film that takes outdated concepts and reinvents them in a magnificent way, we have an extremely ambiguous ending, which will bring the reflection to all.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Satirical Critique of Relationships,"In a society where single people will be sent to a facility to be transformed into an animal unless they are able to find a mate within 45 days the stakes are high. Much higher than they would be if it were our society where people merely feel ostracized when they are incapable of fulfilling one of the most basic of human expectations.Yes, 'The Lobster' serves as a satirical critique of relationships and social acceptance. When someone, is caught masturbating when he should be up and about searching for a woman he is punished. The audience can easily sympathize, for who hasn't felt a bit of guilt after a good old yanking session? There are other weird practices like a maid coming to give you slightest of sexual pleasures, just enough to leave you wanting more.Another way this film criticizes relationships is the way many of its characters choose to pretend to have things in common, to base their relationship on a lie, rather than turning to the only other options which are to stay alone and either be turned into an animal or run off into the woods where the 'loners' retreat. The loners are as the name implies, alone. Not only that, but they live by rules equally as strict as those in the facility. Only here, no one is allowed to have a significant other.There are clearly loners who want nothing more than to be with someone, but just like the outside world, they must follow the rules or risk the wrath other people will unleash upon them. However, there are those that will break these social contracts and strive for what they truly want.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Brilliant, hilarious satire","Colin Farrell's girlfriend leaves him, so he has to move into the hotel where single people go to find new partners. If you don't find one within a specified period of time, you are turned into an animal. If this happens to Farrell, he wants to be turned into a lobster.The pairings need to be based on some kind of shared trait or interest, so with his time running out he tries to convince harsh and unfeeling Angeliki Papoulia that he's just like her. This does not turn out well for Farrell (or for his brother who had previously been at the hotel and who is a dog).Farrell escapes the hotel and joins a community of loners in the woods lead by Léa Seydoux. The community has strict rules (and very harsh punishments) against any kind of romance, but Farrell can't help himself once he realizes he and Rachel Weisz are both short sighted.I think this film is kind of brilliant and utterly hilarious. On the one hand it's a satire about society's insistence that we all have to have a romantic partner ... now. On the other hand, it's about how we do feel an absolute need to find connections.I've heard people complain about the extreme stylization. Trust me ... you actually do sound like this.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Flirtation, obliged in one world, forbidden in the other","""The lobster"" the first English spoken film of Yorgos Lanthimos, is a unique mixture of dystopia and humor that maintains an iron logic within the framwork of his own absurd assumptions.In the first half of the film David (Collin Farrell), who has been left by his wife, is forced to stay in a hotel. In this hotel he has 45 days to find a new lover, otherwise he will be transformed in an animal of his own choosing.In various absurd ways the hotel makes clear to his ""guests"" that living as a single is inferior to living as a couple. There are little sketches of a man eating (alone he chokes on a bone, with a woman his wife saves him) and a woman making a walk (alone she is raped, with a man she is save). The first day of stay one arm of the ""guest"" is fastened behind his back with a handcuff, the message being that living with one arm is just as incomplete as living on your own. It seems clear that in this dystopia we are dealing with a society with strong family values that are enforced in a rather pecuiar way (to say the least).This picture is however completed in the second part of the film. His days in the hotel running out, David flees and joins the loners (not singles, beware of the difference in connotation) that live in the woods outside the hotel. Just as David the other loners are refugees from the hotel. The loners adhere to other, but not less strict, rules. Flirtation is forbidden and when they dance, they all dance alone on some tech music (another absurd scene in the second part of the movie). From time to time we see animals in the wood that obviously don't belong there and so we can only conclude that they are already transformed former ""guests"" of the hotel (another instance of the logic of Lanthimos).So in the end we have two worlds.In the world of the hotel relationships are obliged, by the loners they are forbidden. Both worlds enforce their pribiples in a ruthless way.An element that has not been touched upon so far and that extends to both the first- and second half of the film is the way relationships (or more precisely ""a match"") is defined. Constantly people are looking for other people with which they share some physical (and thus in my opinion shallow) similarity. Sharing a propensity for nose bleeding seems to me not a very good foundation for a marriage, and there are some other examples. Maybe this is a reference to the increasing use of dating software in the modern world. The way an algorithm determines if two people are a match or not is also shallow.""The lobster"" reminded me very much of ""A clockwork orange"" (1971, Stanley Kubrick). It is as absurd and also in ""A clockwork orange"" there are two worlds. The world of Alex and his 'droogs"" and the world of the autorities. Both worlds are full of violence. The world of Alex is like that of the world of the loners and uses raw violence. The world of the authorities is like the world of the hotel and uses regulated violence.Turning to more stylistic issues the use of a voiceover in both films needs to be mentioned. Alex uses very hip language in ""A clockwork orangee"", Rachel voice is emotionless in ""The lobster"" just repeating what we already can see on screen. Where ""A clockwork orange"" uses bright colors, ""The lobster"" uses more natural colors. From the outside the hotel looks like a normal tourist facility on the coast, emphasizing that the world of ""The lobster"" is a normal wold excerpt for a few (very) strange assumptions.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The most original love story,"Definitely an excellent take on how society sees love, and probably the most original love story I've ever seen.Set in a universe in which social rules are so far apart from ours, I couldn't avoid being drawn to it. But at the same time, everything in the movie makes you think about how we behave in our own social reality. A great metaphor of relationships, couples, singles, and many of the social conventions around it. The naive-sounding storytelling on top of that contributes to an almost fairy-tale feel of the movie.Definitely, a movie for those who like out-of-the-ordinary films. It's full of surprises, and a showcase of creativity.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Speechless...,"I watched this two-hour movie without pause, as hypnotized, and when it ended I was left staring at the ending credits and then the black screen for a few more minutes. I had no idea what to write, so I went to see what others have commented. Rare are films that divide the audience like this. There are no middle grades, I didn't see any fives, sixes or sevens. All the reviews I saw either spit on it, rating it one or two, or praise it and give it nines and tens. I think it is both an exaggeration, but one thing is certain - the film achieved the goal that is shared by all the movies, and that is to make a strong impression.In the dystopian future, it is not allowed to be single. Singles are arrested and taken into a remote hotel, where they have 45 days to pair up or otherwise they'll be transformed into an animal of their own choice. A lot of them escape to the nearby forest and the hotel residents hunt them and for every one caught hunter gets an extra day at the hotel. The film shows both sides of the coin, life in the hotel and life in the forest. It is totally weird, irrational, morbid and mesmerizingly disturbing, yet again, it's not tiring to watch. The cast is very good and Yorgos Lanthimos definitely hooked me to see the rest of his movies.8/10In case you didn't notice, except for the main character and his two ""best friends"", there are no names mentioned in the entire movie.

An anti-romance movie or a satire o society?,"Rather a critique/ satire of the way society can influence a relationship. I really like the way Lanthimos satirize society in his films, and even if I saw right now only two of his films (and don't have very much films by the way) I can see that he develop his style of making social commentary by exaggeration and absurdist situations. Of course he isn't the only one who is doing this, but his style of making those things is quite special, and personally I adore it. The Lobster is a film when you can discuses his symbolism and meaning for a while, and the humour and the absurd style of the narrative it's keeping the film for getting boring quickly. I'm not going to discuses it here anyway, yet I want to mention that I like (and I think that Lanthimos did a better job with) the symbolism/ satire here more than in Κυνόδοντας (Dogtooth), however as a move as whole I prefer Κυνόδοντας (Dogtooth) over The Lobster, I just consider that he did a better satire of society here, that's it. And yes, the aspects of society both movie critique are different, is just my opinion that the execution and the way he placed in the movie is more on my preference. Wow I talk more about this aspect that I talk about the movie itself. What absurd, but honestly I'm quite bad at ending reviews, so I will left you here.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Lobster - Review: Brilliantly Unconventional,"Yorgos Lanthimos is a very interesting filmmaker, what I've noticed about him is that he likes ambiguous endings and his story lines are weird. Yorgos Lanthimos directed a movie called Dogtooth back in 2009, that movie is just as weird as The Lobster. I believe if Yorgos Lanthimos keeps up his current track record of ""weirdo movies"", he'll either be discarded as an inexperienced filmmaker who can't tell a cohesive story, or he'll be admired as a brilliant unconventional filmmaker who goes against the ordinary way of story telling.I like weird movies, but the movie has to make sense, and the movie has to have a cohesive story.For me, The Lobster storyline not only makes sense but its execution is highly cohesive.The Lobster is definitely a weird movie, its story execution is extremely bizarre, but the plot is not hard to follow.I am of the belief that The Lobster is a contemporary piece about love and relationships.Colin Farrell is fantastic in this movie; Farrel plays a man named David who is trying to find love, but the society that he lives in just wants him to find a suitable partner. Each character presented in this movie is forced to find a partner or be turned into an animal of their choosing.The underlying theme presented here is just as real in our society, people want absolute love, people want to be with someone that they connect with, but sometimes people have to conform, and sometimes people have to settle for whatever is presented to them in order to survive.The performances presented here are phenomenal all across the board. Ben Whishaw, John C. Reily, Léa Seydoux, and Rachel Weisz deliver exceptional performances in the supporting cast.The directing choices are handled with craftsmanship, the wide angle shots are beautiful, and the deep focus shots play a huge part in telling the story.Overall, this movie is extremely bizarre, it's not conventional, it's abnormal, stunning, cohesive, underlying, and brilliant.Final Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'm here to warn you,"I fell asleep during this movie probably 20 times. It started out OK, if not a little weird and I don't mind that.Then it came to the scenes after the initial ones 30 minutes in wherein dull dialogues were exchanged in deadpan.I know the reviewers think they're smart for rating this movie highly out of a sense of moral obligation to shine a light on our society and it's hypocrisy/absurdity about relationships.What I don't understand is why it needed to be so thoroughly unpleasant, boring, anticlimactic & predictable.It simply wasn't a good movie. It aroused little deeper thought and evoked almost no emotion. You knew what was coming a mile away at all times.I would highly recommend to anyone that they avoid this thoroughly unoriginal and self-indulgent dumpster fire of a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A weirdly bizarre but enjoyable experience,"Well then... What a weird movie about the social construct of the pressures of society to pressure you into a relationship and single life and such. It was very difficult for me to understand completely at first so I watched a few videos on it and read up on it. After all that my eyes are opened to this beautifully dark comedic movie. Amazing awkward acting from everyone, and beautifully directed. And I really loved that it had an open ending open to interpretation.I get why some people didn't rate ""The Lobster"" higher, I mean after all, it is very hard to interpret at times and occasionally they tried too hard to be weird, but other than that, I did like it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Shallow absurdist ""comedy""","Apparently it is fashionable to take a bizarre premise, preferably involving a humorous animal, and spin out the consequences without regard for logic or reason, even though the characters behave as if they had no choice but to follow the ""logic"" of the situation. While superficially similar to Wes Anderson's films, this movie is no where near the quality of Anderson's films. Anderson's movies use a cartoon world to emphasize the humanity of the characters. This movie creates characters that operate by cartoon logic in an all too real appearing world. No humanity, a few humorous scenes, and a lot of gratuitous violence. The characters teach us nothing. Watching this movie was like being trapped in the nightmare of a very sick writer. Even the violence felt contrived - which is all the more disturbing.Skip it. Life is too short.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing ending,So anyway what can we say about this movie this movie is really not good it's actually very good but the ending sucks it's interesting you have good acting you have an interesting storyline to begin with you have great soundtrack good effects you watched very interesting but then just after three fourths of the movie you are confronted with such terrible nonsense that I won't review for the ones who haven't seen the movie yet but it's it's very interesting only sad thing is that the story at the ending became an example of Hollywood's needing to finish the story when they don't have the IDS yet so stupid if the guy who wrote the story took a bit of more time to work it congrats Jesus it would have been a great movie,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
