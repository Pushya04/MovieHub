"Spectacular recounting about the D-Day landings at Normandy on June 6, 1944, based on Cornelius Ryan novel","This an important, interesting movie depicting the Overlord operation with monumental logistic and means of effecting the Normandy landing , the most difficult campaign of war . The picture brings to life the famous images of WWII and splendidly the most sensational military operation of the history in an Allied hard-fought effort . The film develops the previous days to the D-Day invasion , such as the landings and the advance over France . The film is magnificently produced in big budget by the great 20th Century Fox producer Darryl F. Zanuck . Evocative cinematography by Jean Bourgoun and catching song by Paul Anka with musical score by Maurice Jarre . Excellent casting by a great plethora of stars . Special mention for John Wayne as Lt. Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort , he's top-notch as a tough , valiant officer in this believable war film and terrific acting by Richard Todd as Major commanding Us paratroopers dropped to protect the flanks of the invasion and taking strategic bridge . Furthermore , known Generals and officers played by prestigious players , as Germans : General Gunther (Curt Jurgens) , Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (Hinz) , Field Marshal Von Rundstedt (Paul Hartmann), and Allied : Brig. General Theodore Roosevelt Jr (Henry Fonda) , Brig. General Norman Cota (Robert Mitchum) , General Haines (Mel Ferrer) , Brig. General James Gavin (Robert Ryan) , General Raymond Barton (Edmond O'Brien), Lt General OMar N Bradley (Stuart) , General Bernard L Montgomery (T. Reid) and General Dwight D. Eisenhower played by Henry Grace . Grace was a famed set designer , while he worked extensively for many films , his only appearance was an uncredited performance as Eisenhower ; despite not being an actor , he was cast for his uncanny resemblance to the General . This famous event from how was orchestrated the dangerous , risky landing maneuvers was professionally directed by a magnificent trio of directors , Ken Annakin , Bernhard Wicki and Andrew Marton.Adding more details along with the well developed on the movie , the events that happened on June 6, 1944 were the following ones : Shortly after midnight on June 6, about 23.500 US and British paratroopers landed along the edges of the landing beaches . Their mission was to seize vital bridges and communications centers. They also had to hold off any Germans counterattacks until they were relieved by the amphibious forces. The Airbone landings were largely successful. Some US troops missed their target and end up scattered over the countryside. The main amphibious landings took place after an artillery bombardment from some 200 Allied warships at German positions also came under attack from Allied medium and heavy bombers. They were part of the 11,500 aircraft committed to D-Day. They bombed the Germans on and behind the five landing beaches. US troops landed on Utah beach. Strong currents and inaccurate navigation meant that they were a little away from their precise target. They landed about 1 mile (1,6 km) south. The beach there was relatively undefended. The troops soon knocked out the only concrete gun position guarding the beach.Demolitions teams cleared paths through the obstacles the beach and the first tanks crossed the Atlantic Wall. They fanned out into the countryside to link up with the paratroopers. By nightfall of D-Day some 23,000 men and 1,700 vehicles had gone ashore. The beach had been highly congested for much of the day. Utah was a triumph ,however Omaha beach was nearly a disaster, the fight was the most difficult. The Us troops were unable to get off the beach to make room for later waves of invaders. There were better defenses there than on the other beaches, and the German defenders were positioned on high ground, from where they could pour fire down on the attackers.The allies also made mistakes. The naval bombardment ended too soon, and the bombers missed their targets and launched landing crafts and amphibious tanks too far out from the beach, may were sunk. When the first assault wave landed ,it faced a bar-rage of fire , some men were thinking of evacuation. However small groups began to make it off the beach to the high ground beyond. By dusk, some men were ashore, most were still crowed on the beach. The high ground beyond was only thinly held by exhausted survivors waves. Some 2300 US troops had been killed in the landings. The operation had come close to disaster. The three Anglo-Canadian beaches-Gold, Sword and Juno stretched fore some 25 miles. They were wide and open and ideal for amphibious landings. The British on Gold and Sword quickly crashed though the Atlantic wall. Their success was due partly to a range of specially developed armored vehicles known as Funnies. The Canadians at Juno had a tougher time. They faced rough seas and alert defenders .By late morning ,they were also pushing inland. Despite the horror of beaches , overall Allied losses were far lower than expected. Some 6000 US personnel were killed, wounded, or missing, along with 4300 British and Canadian troops. German losses totaled between 4000 and 8000. By the day's end ,some 128000 Allied soldiers were ashore and many more were on their way.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Still a classic after 42 years!,"Invariably compared with ""Saving Private Ryan"" (SPR), this scores over the more modern work because of the focus on all the major sides of the action (British, American, French and German).All languages are used (with subtitles as appropriate - eg the Germans speak in German, etc).While true that the battle scenes are not gory as SPR's, and that the sounds of battle are muted during the dialog (unlike SPR's), it should be borne in mind that in '62, the audience rating of the time *was* a General Release (""G"" in the US, ""A"" in the UK (I'm guessing for the UK, but it is now PG)) - which more detail would not have allowed.I think part of the purpose of this film is to allow *everyone* to see what happened 18 years before!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Shaving Ryan's Privates,"True, the first half an hour of Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" is truly mesmerizing but then it degenerates into a soap opera of sorts and all the angst and horror of war evaporates until the truly sentimental finale. ""The Longest Day"" doesn't depend on special effects but on the minute by minute horror of its moment. It's also, if I'm permitted to say it, a lot of fun to watch. Strangely enough the all star cast is not distracting at all. It was much more in ""Saving Private Ryan"" with a cast of up and comings headed by Tom Hanks himself. In ""The Longest Day"" there are real moments, film, cinematic moments that are intimately connected with the profoundest sense of drama: The clicking of the rifle. Richard Burton, Richard Beymer and the boots of the dead German. Red Buttons hanging from the Cathedral. Paul Anka, Fabian, Robert Wagner, the landing in Normandy. This film remains one of the best, from every angle, films of its kind.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"The last good WW2 film made by people ""who were there""","This is perhaps one of the most ambitious, epic WW2 films to have been made; certainly it is the last of the classic B&W films made about the subject. Featuring an all-star cast (John Wayne, Richard Burton, Kurt Jurgens... even a cameo by Sean Connery!), it comprehensively details the build-up and execution of the Normandy landings in 1944, taking care to show how the event was perceived by Allied and Axis soldiers and commanders, as well as the Free French resistance.  This is a film that takes great care in documenting the events of the day, without lapsing into sickly sentimentalism or getting distracted with fictional characters' personal lives (a failing of many WW2 movies since about 1970), or over-emphasising any one nation's importance in the operation (although, admittedly, Canadians may feel a little short-changed).Classic moments abound, notably the landing at St.Mere-Eglise and the soldier who gets caught in the church steeple, the frustrations of the front-line German commanders and fighters, and the numerous cameos for film nerds to keep track of.If you want a wartime romance, or an appearance by Matt Damon or Ben Affleck, or long, loving shots of the Stars & Stripes in slo-mo, or a gritty blood'n'guts fest, you'll be disappointed.  This film has broader concerns, and was made with much more thoroughness.  There is no agenda at work here, pro-war or anti-.  It is solely concerned with documenting Operation ""Overlord"" for the film-going public, and succeeds brilliantly; a shame then, that it has not made the top 50 war films list.A must-see for any fan of war films.",,Anonymous,History
"""Gentlemen, We Start the War from Right Here.""","Simply put if things had gone differently on June 6, 1944 we would be living in a very different and very much uglier world than we have now. The Longest Day is Darryl F. Zanuck's tribute to all who were involved in Allied invasion at Normandy.Even viewing it now as opposed to the theaters back then back then I am staggered at Zanuck's incredible eye and grasp for the detail of the Normandy invasion. He did the smart thing and not only bought Cornelius Ryan's standard account of D-Day, but got Ryan to write a very coherent screenplay. Even one who has absolutely no grasp of military history will be able to follow exactly what was going on.Several of the people who are portrayed in the film also served as technical advisers of it. When you Peter Lawford as Lord Lovat or Robert Ryan as General James Gavin and many others these people aided in recreating the project.Zanuck may have had the largest movie set in history to work with, at least up to that time. You are seeing the film photographed in the places it actually happened. The beaches, the towns of St. Mere Eglise and Ouisterham, even the embarkation areas in the UK. I doubt you could do The Longest Day today because of the changes in all these places now. Lots of cooperation from the British and French governments was necessary.You also couldn't do it because the budget would be the size of the U.S. national debt today. This was the last days of the all powerful studio system and even with a lot of the stars free-lancing at that point, Darryl F. Zanuck was still a most powerful man in Hollywood with a lot of favors owed. One example was Richard Burton who was shooting Cleopatra at the time The Longest Day was also shooting. For his two brief, but memorable scenes as an RAF pilot, they shot around him on Cleopatra also a 20th Century Fox production while he filmed his part for Zanuck.Even the Germans came in for a portrait of them as human beings. Curt Jurgens as General Blumentritt, who was also a technical adviser, put it philosophically best about how after he can't convince Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl to wake up Hitler to move the Panzer Divisions, breaks open a bottle of cognac and decides to drink it before the Allies arrive.I have several favorites in The Longest Day. Richard Todd who actually was at D-Day and was a decorated hero himself, plays commando leader, Major John Howard who is asked to paratroop into France and capture and hold a key bridge intact. Todd is channeling his own as well as Howard's war experience into the film and gives a performance of unusual depth.Norman Rossington and a pre-James Bond Sean Connery who was just making his debut as Bond in Dr. No, give some good comic relief as a cockney and Irish soldier landing on Sword Beach. So does Kenneth More as a British beachmaster with his bulldog Winston.The French are well represented by Arletty, Bourvil, Christian Marquand and by Irina Demich. Being that three of these play civilian roles they get the only two women's parts of any substance in The Longest Day. I do like the scene where some Germans checking Irina out in a low cut dress, fail to properly search her. Irina also demonstrates how much the women were equal partners in the Resistance. Marquand as a captain of a Free French company is involved in a particularly bloody battle for a coastal town.Of course the American cinema is well represented. Charlton Heston was to originally play the part that John Wayne does, but he couldn't get free of some commitments of his own and when Wayne became available, Zanuck grabbed him. Heston was later quoted as saying Wayne did a better job than he would have in any event. Wayne's best scene was when he saw some American bodies dangling from roofs in St. Mere Eglise. As I've said many times, John Wayne had one of the best faces for movie closeups ever. One look at the horror expressed in his face tells you all you need to know.Henry Fonda plays General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. who would within a month after the invasion die on Normandy Beach. Had he lived, Roosevelt might have picked up the pieces of a stalled political career. But that was not to be the case. Roosevelt was found dead of a heart attack in his tent after the invasion when the Allies were trying to break out of the beach.The heaviest casualties on D-Day were on Omaha Beach where Robert Mitchum plays General Norman Cota a division commander. Mitchum is involved at the climax of the film where American GIS after being hung up for hours, break through and insure the invasion's success.The Longest Day is not only great drama and a great war film, but it is as accurate a film as you will ever get depicting the Normandy invasion, good history as well.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A splendid film by all counts.........,"I'm old enough to have seen this epic when it was first released and, even as a nine year old, I was impressed. It was the great Daryl Zanuck's last hurrah and a fitting one (not his last film - just his last worthwhile film).This is a great film. It's not perfect but its faults are few and minor. For me the most glaring fault is the amateurish delivery by the actor (a near ringer) portraying Ike. Also, the very beautiful actress portraying the French resistance fighter is wearing a very 1960s hairdo (a common problem with Hollywood films).I see this film every memorial day. It helps me to remember my father, a Navy gunner's mate in the Pacific theater and my maternal grandfather, an island-hopping Sgt. in the Marine Corps. Personally, as a veteran, I find this movie as realistic as I think it was possible to be in 1961.Is it the best American war film? No. I would place it in the top 10 alongside the following:1. All Quiet On the Western Front (1930) 2. Platoon (1986) 3. Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970) 4. In Which We Serve (British - 1943) 5. Patton (1970) 6. They Were Expendable (1945) 7. Twelve O'Clock High (1949) 8. Paths of Glory (1957) 9. Grand Illusion (1940?) 10.The Longest Day (1962)",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Cast & The Actual Event: Overwhelming Numbers,"This was an another one of these all-star casts that you don't see in more modern times, in which about everyone who was actor made an appearance....or it just seems that way. For those unfamiliar with this film, take a look back on the main page here and check out the famous names in this movie. Click the ""more"" under the cast overview and you'll see all the names. It's unbelievable. Some of them, to be fair, had very short roles in here, such as Henry Fonda, Rod Steiger and Roddy McDowell, but this is a real ""Who's Who"" of the acting profession in 1962. There are also a lot of German actors in here speaking German (with subtitles provided), perhaps numbering even more than the English-speaking stars. That's because the famous day of June 6, 1944, is seen from both sides of the conflict.At three hours, it gives you plenty of D-Day World War II action. Almost two-thirds of the movie involves action from that famous invasion. In some spots, it just gets to be too much. Frankly, the whole film is too much and almost bogs down in too many areas....and it shouldn't, but it is a very technical film. And, for a film 45 years old, the action is pretty realistic. I thought the best shots were the overheads during one particular scenes when the Alies were going through a town.I am anything but a WWII expert so how much detail of the infamous 'D-Day"" here is correct, Since they went into such detail, I'll assume they were fairly accurate. I can't say but this movie educated me on the size of the task. I had no idea ""D-Day"" was this huge in scope: three million men and 5,000 ships??!!! Amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Allow Yourself A Long Day To See This All-Star War Pic...,"Darryl F. Zanuck's THE LONGEST DAY is indeed long, has over 48 international stars, 3 directors, and took about 2 years to make.  1962 was the year of the epic as far as the 1960's were concerned and this exceptional film is no exception.  No cost was spared.  Some good war sequences mixed with stock footage of WWII effectively present a version of D-Day, June of 1944.  We see it from the German perspective (in sub-titles), the American plight, and the rest of the Allied forces.  One problem:  If you are seeing the film for the first time AFTER watching SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, you may come out disappointed.  The war scenes are well-crafted, however, the piercing reality is missing.  I tried to watch it as objectively as I could, but it is hard, considering the impression Spielberg's version of D-Day left on me.The soldiers are led by a variety of huge name actors.  John Wayne is a no-holds-barred Captain who will fight, broken foot or not.  Henry Fonda plays Teddy Roosevelt, Jr. looking not to be treated as the son of an ex-president.   Bob Mitchum is great as a cigar-smoking officer of the U.S. raid on Omaha Beach.  The only problem is authenticity.  The actors look good and realisticly war-like, however, they are kept in frame to showcase their talents and they never seem to be near death.  This is by no means an anti-war film like RYAN.  It can be harrowing at times, but watching Richard Burton, Sean Connery, and Rod Steiger deliver cameo-like performances (meaning they know they are only on-screen for a short time) was a bit contrived and distracting.Overall, I did like the movie.  It is greatly detailed and it lets you know exactly who each actor is playing.  This is pure American propaganda, but it is still exciting.  Too many fearful war experiences are handled with kid gloves.  The grand spectacle of the top-notch production values as well as non-stop action  make the picture watchable, if only once.RATING: 7 of 10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Almost Like Being There,"Quite simply the best film ever attempted on this subject. The events leading up to the D Day invasion in France are meticiously viewed from the French, British, German and American sides. The dialogue is spoken in the national languages of the countries taking part in the invasion and this aspect alone elevates it high above most other films. The superb black and white photography adds yet another layer or realism . Cast features many international stars, but never stoops to a ""spot the stars"" formula like too many of these films tend to do.Clichés are avoided and the people portrayed are realistically drawn. Even the Germans are presented as actual military leaders and not the stereotypical Nazi villains . There are massive invasion scenes, quieter scenes at the villages before the raid, and a commando raid on a German howitzer emplacement in the basement of a casino, a scene that follows the attacking Allied group from an ariel perspective while they move through town past the docked fishing boats and destroyed buildings. The overhead shots of the beaches with hundreds of troops, tanks and landing craft gives the viewer a very accurate picture of the massive scale of the invasion, something that Spielberg just could not pull off in ""Pvt Ryan"".A three hour film that is up for repeat viewings. You will discover something new each time you view it. The screenplay was by the author Cornelius Ryan from his own book.No silly romantic subplots, just the facts. I remember seeing this film after it opened with my father and uncle. It was impressive then, and it holds up beautifully today. In my humble opinion, this is the best WW11 film ever made. One of the greats.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"An editing masterpiece, an epic day, lots of great filming, but also diffused and imperfect","The Longest Day (1962)This is an ambitious movie, extremely well photographed, filled with stars and secondary actors of fame and talent. And it covers roughly at 24 hour period leading up to and into the epic and dramatic June 6, 1944 invasion of German-held France known as D-Day.On all these levels, the movie almost has to succeed. And it does. It's a popularizing account of an important event. It's history made simple, for sure, but it compresses the complexity with good intentions, and with some fair handling of both the German and non-German sides of the battles, inside and war rooms and on the beach.The movie is filled, however, with so many characters (maybe fifty who are given enough camera time to take on some small meaning, though the poster advertises ""42 International Stars"") and shot in so many locations (Germany, France, London, on boats, on beaches, in villas, by the bridge, in the bunker, in the strategic commands, along the roads, flying overhead, on and on) it is truly impossible to engage in any one part of it fully. Many scenes are superb, even short ones, sometimes with great actors like Robert Ryan playing with a light on his face (in a comic scary way) and sometimes with unknowns who for a moment shine in their terror. But it's necessarily fragmented and dispersed.There are, furthermore, attempts at humor that are a welcome break to the seriousness but are sometimes too silly and improbable to really make sense. It's like the humor that perks up little moments in a Chris Nolan Batman movie--except this is real life, this is the real D-Day and not an entertainment. You don't expect a documentary, exactly, but the levity--even if as cute as a young Sean Connery goofing on the beach as bullets fly around--is a bit off target.The fact that this kind of movie works this well is probably amazing. It even got divided between different directors, and so the unifying qualities show a kind of logistical planning that paid off. (There are only two cinematographers and, crucially, one editor.) And of course there is history holding it together.And this is a history that is getting lost. Fans of WWII movies (or of WWII history) will have no trouble feeling the grand, world-changing nature of D-Day. I grew up on American movies and around my parents and grandparents who had strong feelings about the war and about D-Day in particular. But young people, like the students in my classes at college, often born fifty years after the fact, have sometimes not even heard of D-Day. Many don't know a Nazi from RAF officer, even in concept. (I'm not kidding. I ask, routinely.) This is just life. Blame education if you want, but it's a natural movement forward to more recent and still living world events. We had D-Day, they have 9-11.I watched the movie with my girlfriend who is not from the States, and who knew only the outline of the war. (Her country wasn't involved in it enough to make a dent on its own history.) And so she watched with a kind of dulled boredom. The cameos by famous people were fun for both of us, and filming was to be appreciated, but the drama I felt even with the opening credits I saw was dependent on knowing the larger scope.And so this movie will have a shrinking audience and shrinking appreciation over time. It's a long watch--three hours--and it has a steady stream of great moments. But it's not a great movie in movie-making terms. Exciting and important and with a wikipedia page to make this all clear, but it's unlikely to fully integrate and take total form as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Flawed Film But A Great Tribute To Courage,"Despite being a classic war movie THE LONGEST DAY is very flawed as a production . Did someone say there's just too many stars in this movie ? If so I agree . Look at the way they're introduced , Mister big name movie star has back to camera , he turns round and wow we're looking at a big name movie star . All this is somewhat distracting .It should also be pointed out that many of the cast are let down by Corneilus Ryan's script . Ryan wrote the definitive account of the last year of the war via his trilogy THE LONGEST DAY , A BRIDGE TOO FAR and THE LAST BATTLE , he was a truly great historian but it's obvious he couldn't master the technicalities of screen writing , his characters are more like caricatures with the Americans all being butch and macho while the Europeans are somewhat eccentric save for a few Englishmen who have stiff upper lips . Like HG Wells with THINGS TO COME Ryan writes dialogue that sounds suspiciously like thought processes , an example being where the rangers fight their way into a bunker only to find it's a decoy and someone says "" You mean we came all the way up here for nothing ? "" . You can almost imagine the passage in the book saying "" it was obvious to the men who had survived the battle , so obvious that no one dare say it but they'd fought their way to the bunker for nothing ""Despite that I will congratulate Ryan and everyone else involved in the production for pointing out that the 6th of June was a multi national effort to free Western Europe from the Nazi jackboot , Brits , Yanks and the Free French are represented ( Not sure about the Canadians but ? ) unlike the rather overrated SAVING PRIVATE RYAN that seems to indicate that D Day was an American solo effort THE LONGEST DAY is far more accurate and subjective as to what happened on the day . The script also has the temerity to suggest that the allies didn't win the battle but the Nazis lost due to the military incompetence of Hitler . It should be remembered that despite the overwhelming fire power of the allies they could have easily have been massacred on the beaches and that the Normandy landings was probably the most complicated military endeavor in all of military historyA word of warning - If you ever watch this movie only see the widescreen version because the technical aspects are awesome . The outstanding scene is where a few Americans sit on a bunk playing cards and one of them stands up pleading "" Hey guys , anyone got five bucks , ten bucks , anyone got twenty bucks "" . At this point the camera quickly pans out and the sound crashes in making the audience realize that the scene is set in a billets with hundreds of soldiers . Needless to say this scene is totally ruined when it's watched on a scanned copyTHE LONGEST DAY is a flawed film but a great tribute to the men who fought in that campaign . As the veterans who fought there gather tomorrow for the 60th anniversary along with politicians who didn't have the guts to join the military but are very happy to use it for political gain I'd just like to say a big thank you to all the men who fought there . Thank you to one and all . If it weren't for you I wouldn't be here now",8.0,Anonymous,History
Canadians were there as well,"I'm a huge John Wayne fan and war movie buff. This movie was well done but again places the Canadian accomplishment of the day not only on the back burner but still in the fridge. My father was in the Canadian Air Force and served in England during the war. As typical Hollywood so often portrays Canada in WW2, the movie devoted about 1 minute to the Canadian participation on D-Day. Canada landed over 15,000 men on Juno Beach and achieved most of their 1st day objectives, they actually pushed the furthest inland of any of the 5 beaches. Still love the movie just wish once and awhile we would get our due.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Candian Presence in The Longest Day,"The previous comments about Canadian participation in the Normandy invasion were significant - insofar as there weren't very many. One of the five Normandy beaches was Canadian (Juno), but there is almost no mention of this in The Longest Day, and I'm sure that one would be hard pressed to find many Americans (and not a whole lot more Canadians) who know this. Unfortunately, it is movies such as this and other popular media that shape the historic knowledge of people on both sides of the border. In the near absence of Canadian content, I find it ironic that a young Canadian (Paul Anka) not only played a part in the movie as an American soldier, but also wrote the theme music. I find it also ironic that the legendary rifle used by US soldiers during WW2 and shown in this movie was designed by a Canadian as well (Garand is a French Canadian name). The cruelest irony, of course, is the fact that thousands of Canadian soldiers were maimed or lost there lives on 6 June 1944 and the days thereafter, with virtually no acknowledgement in this movie. I have always enjoyed watching this movie, but it is unfortunate that I must use my imagination to see in it the heroic and selfless wartime effort of my father's generation, in similar fashion to viewers in the US and UK.",,Anonymous,History
Thank God for the atom bomb,"Biggest takeaway from this mammoth all-star war movie about d-day is that the boys playing with their toys were just having so much fun. The absolute scale and seriousness of the game they were playing only emphasized the complete, male testosterone driven idiocy of the whole thing. I thought, when it was over, thank god for Einstein, thank god for Fermi and the Manhattan project, thank god for nuclear weapons which bring the masters of war directly into the line of fire. Hopefully no one is so crazy as to commit suicide (and racial suicide) by starting another world war. Because there can never be a WWIV -- WWIII will, if it happens, be the very last world war.Actually 'The Longest Day' is a terrific flick. The Germans, other than hitler, are treated with respect. As honorable, worthy adversaries. No one is inherently evil or good. The multiple storylines flow smoothly. The action is intense and realistic without being unnecessarily drenched in blood and exploding body parts like a more modern movie would feel compelled to be.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Could have been unwieldy, instead it is comprehensive","In 1962, almost post studio system 20th Century Fox was in trouble. Almost broke because of the cost of making then in-progress Cleopatra, they were in a similar fix with filming ""The Longest Day"". They had been churning out a series of small films with small stars that were losers at the box office. Turn on Fox Movie Channel Retro if you want an object lesson in their sorry output during the late 50s/early 60s. Enter stage left Darryl F. Zanuck, former head of Fox studio, who had left the states in 1956 to make a series of loser films in Europe with his girlfriends who were loser actresses. He argued how he could rescue The Longest Day to the board of directors, and the job became his.The result is a great film in the tradition of old Hollywood - Zanuck's kind of Hollywood - that entertains on a grand scale, telling the story of the Allied invasion of France with a star studded cast. The big stars of the day were all there, with special billing for John Wayne. The cast includes Eddie Albert, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Sean Connery, Red Buttons, Steve Forrest and Leo Genn. Unbelievably Sal Mineo and Roddy McDowell get into the act too. And there are many others.There are many stories being told in many places from the viewpoints of the Allied soldiers, the Germans, and the French resistance prior to the actual invasion. We don't get to follow the stories of all of these people to the end, but each story gives us a slice of life and produces a great and compelling story of the overall invasion. You don't know who is going to get cut down suddenly, who is going to make it, and who is just going to be the victim of just plain bad luck. It is all part of the horror of war. Highly recommended. It is a long film, but it is also an engrossing one.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor""","June 6th,1944. The Allied invasion of northern Europe begins along the Normandy coastline. In the early hours of the morning thousands of British and American paratroopers are dropped inland to secure strategic objectives, to be followed at dawn by the main assault force consisting of Americans (Utah and Omaha beaches), British (Gold and Sword beaches), Canadians (Juno beach) and French (attached to the British at Sword). By nightfall it is hoped that the troops will be moving off the beaches and linking up with the Airborne forces inland.This multi-faceted account of the D-Day landings was a mammoth undertaking in its day. Adapted for the screen by Cornelius Ryan from his book of the same name, it is a very detailed look at the events of that momentous day in history. Every angle is covered, from the commanders, planners and soldiers to the French underground, civilians and the German defenders. The cast list reads like a who's who of international cinema at the time, to the point where this can detract from the drama of the events at times. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the production is staggering in its scope, most of it filmed on the actual battle sites where possible. In terms of cost, this would surely be impossible to film these days.There are a couple of drawbacks, however. Some of the dialogue leans toward the corny at times, especially by todays standards. Also, since the release of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Band Of Brothers' the landings on Omaha beach and the parachute drop sequences look tame and rather antiseptic. This isn't a criticism of the production, so much as a comment on how the film is starting to show its age.On the plus side there are some very well executed sequences. The scaling of the cliffs at Point du Hoc by the US Rangers is one, and the storming of the town of Ouistreham by French commandos is another. This is probably the most breathtaking scene in the entire film, as an airborne camera tracks the commandos through the streets and ends up circling a German machine gun nest on top of the casino building.The film needs to be viewed in its original widescreen aspect ratio to fully appreciate its epic scale. The DVD print is a beautifully clean transfer in the original black & white. I, and I suspect many others, got quite a shock a couple of years back when I tuned in to watch it on TV, to find it has been digitally colourised.

"Bonjour, mademoiselle. Je suis américain.","One of the best films of 1962 and one of the best war films ever, The Longest Day features outstanding cinematography, special effects and art work. You really felt that you were present in the time leading up to June 6, 1944, when Allied forces made the incredible landing on the beaches of Normandy.Like me, I am sure many people reading this had family members that were involved (me - a Candian brother-in-law) in this massive undertaking. To see the story from the standpoint of the men involved was a tremendous experience.Yes, I've seen Saving Private Ryan, and the incredible carnage in the first 20 minutes, but I was just as moved by the same footage in this film without the blood. You felt the frustration of the men and the determination to succeed. Their pent-up emotions after an interminable wait to begin were unleashed on the unprepared Germans. The jubilation of the French citizens displayed gave us a real example of a country waiting to be liberated. (Maybe Bush should watch this to see how it really is when people welcome your invasion.) Robert Mitchum led an all-star cast that must have included every major actor in Hollywood at the time. If you can't find a favorite, then you are just not looking hard enough.A superb war film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Richard Todd playing himself?,"In this film, the very reliable British actor, Richard Todd, plays the part of Major John Howard who commanded the paratroopers charged with holding Pegasus Bridge and were the first troops, just about, to land. Richard Todd had actually been part of the real D-Day force in 1944, though not at Pegasus Bridge.Darryl F.Zanuck had initially wanted him to play himself in the film, he thought it would be good publicity. Richard Todd declined. As a joke, Zanuck then had a line inserted into the film whereby Todd, as Howard, addressed a young officer by the name of - Todd!

"Hard to sit through the whole thing at once, but informative","I have spent years studying World War II, particularly in France. I have walked Omaha Beach and climbed the cliff - with no one shooting at me from the top. I have walked around the square in St. Mère Eglise. In other words, I know something about D-Day.That allowed me to be impressed by Zanuck's effort to recreate a moment in history. But, with all due respect, this movie comes off, to me, as something of a dramatized documentary, a history lesson with cameos. It is great for learning about how we finally made it across Omaha Beach, for example, and up that cliff. But it pales next to the opening of *Saving Private Ryan* when it comes to making you feel as if you are there, one of those poor soldiers in the first waves trying to cross that beach.The acting is all fine, the ""staging"" of the scenes, especially Omaha Beach, very impressive. I could have done without the brief cameos designed to make the French civilians look foolish, as in Bourvil's portrayal of the mayor of Courville.You will learn a lot about D-Day from this movie - though not as much as if you read any good book on the subject. The movie, being a movie, leaves us with all sorts of questions. Like: why didn't the Allied air force destroy those pillboxes at the top of the Omaha Beach cliff before we landed on the beaches down below. Why didn't we have better info about German positions in the area? Etc.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Pours defecation all over Spielberg's bespectacled face,"Of all war films this is perhaps one if not the best of its kind. The scale of the project, the actors, and the general depiction of the different countries and people involved make this a 'sure fire' winner. The film in comparison to say Saving Private Ryan is not a single layered narrative, unnecessarily emotional or utterly ignorant that other countries other than America actually participated, it even notes that Britain were in the war before America!!!! Perhaps this film does not have the special effects that Private Ryan does have (to its credit)but this aside it certainly makes up for it in every other area. The sheer fact that this was the most expensive black and white movie until Schindler's list is testament to that. The advisers on this film were actually there and helped draw the plans themselves, yes it is a drama, but when considering history please don't disregard fact for the want of a better plot (Spielberg) If you like war movies then this is the king of the genre, if you have never seen a war movies or dislike them, this may just about change your mind.

all-star war goodie,"In its original black and white (not the colourised version), 'The Longest Day' is a fine war story, a classy movie with a starry cast featuring the likes of John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, Richard Todd, alongside Richard Beymer, Paul Anka, Tommy Sands and other trendy pretty-boys of the time. The contrast between the featured actors works well.D-Day, the battle on the beaches of Normandy, has become the stuff of legend, the type of derring-do which makes as good a rattling adventure yarn as it does a warning sign against the mindlessness of warfare. In 'The Longest Day' we see small stories, and big ones. We see Americans, Brits, Germans, and view the conflict and the issues from all sides. There is pathos and humour.Directed with a sure hand by Ken Annakin and Andrew Marton, this film represents one of the best of its kind. Well written by Romain Gary and James Jones, it makes you think about what really happened during those momentous days of World War II. And for those of us who had family members who were involved in D-Day, this film does its bit towards making us proud of their contribution.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Extreme disappointment,"I have just come back from visiting the D-Day beaches, museums, memorials and cemeteries for the second time in 4 years. This time with my wife. I find the subject fascinating.I saw this movie a very long time ago, I must have been a kid. I have just seen it with my wife, hoping to help her put some order in all the things she has seen in Normandy.I was sadly shocked to see such poor acting and above all, extremely terrible directing for the English and American scenes and ""just"" bad directing for the German ones.Other films from the same period and older portray battle scenes and the soldier soul with far superior credibility.I can imagine the directors telling the poor actors ""look towards the horizon with dignified face"" and other rubbish of that sort. No attention to logic, coherent acting or historical research. This resulted in empty, soulless characters.It was really hard not to turn the film off. The stupid comical acting in the middle of a battle made my whole body cringe. Why did they need to invent things like paratrooper John Steele hanging for 10 hours and being deafened by the church bells? That is not true and looked stupid! He was shot in the foot BEFORE landing, he was hanging there for ONLY 2 hours until taken prisoner by the Germans to be liberated by the 82nd and 101st Airborne. And he was not deaf for hours or days, he even said that the tension and the pain in his foot did not allow him to hear the bells. In the town of Sainte-Mère-Église you can read all about this. Do not rely on the internet because sadly it mostly considers the scenes on the film as historical facts.And why did the actor play him as if he was a silly clown? I guess the directors thought that they needed some comedy in the movie in order to keep people entertained.If they paid 1/4 million $ in 1962! to John Wayne to appear and ruin the movie, they could have used a small fraction of that sum on historical research or a proper director.A positive note is that the Germans spoke German amongst themselves, and not English with German accent, which sounds imbecilic. The same applies to the other languages, although they are all very stereotyped.Quoting freely from ""To Be or Not to Be"" (1942) what this movie has done to Cornelius Ryan's book is what the Germans did to Poland.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Not a fair comparison,"THE LONGEST DAY is one of the if not the greatest World War II movie epics. However, it is unfair to compare it to Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. To do so would really be comparing apples and oranges. Spielberg's movie was meant to convey the gore and horror of war and succeeded quite admirably. In THE LONGEST DAY, which was shot in semi-documentary style, Zanuck's intent was to show the monumental effort involved, on the part of the allies, in mounting a successful cross channel invasion. In that regard this film also succeeded quite admirably. It should be regarded more as a history lesson rather than as simply dramatic entertainment. The historical value of the film far outweighs any minor dramatic licenses taken by Zanuck.",,Anonymous,History
Great vehicle for exposing popular actors of the time.,"This is a 1962 attempt to be an accurate rendition of D Day, based on Cornelius Ryan's book, ""The Longest Day"", when the allied forces of World War two crossed the English Channel and fought their way up the beaches of France. The whole film is about the events of that day.The list of popular actors playing the parts of the various countries and ethnicities of the time is too long to mention in this review. However, Eddy Albert (a method actor) was quite believable and contributed much to the energy of this rendition. Be sure to see Eddy Albert again in uniform inThe Teahouse of the August Moon (1956). And that little cutie Irina Demark was the girlfriend of the producer, Darryl F. Zanuck.You can tell this picture was remastered sometime recently as it looks as crisp as the day it was made. And you can only find a few missed specks on the Blu-ray rendition. The Blu-ray version has the obligatory voice-over recollections from the only remaining director.The film is a keeper and is worth the purchase.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Grand traditional Hollywood war movie,"This is an old fashion war movie. It looks at the invasion of Normandy from the build up to the events of D-day. It's got big stars, big scale and some big action.It was a big hit despite some discrepancies. It's a Hollywood extravaganza, not a documentary. They got John Wayne to put the big name on the headline. But they also got pre-Bond Sean Connery. The German side of the story is also well represented.The action is big. Without CG, the grand scale on the beach of the actual day is more hinted at than actually achieved on the screen. For example 'Saving Private Ryan' provides a much more visceral experience for the landing. The attack on the casino in Ouistreham looks great. Who can forget the nuns? It's really a triumph of old school filmmaking.As a complete D-day extravaganza, there really isn't a rival. It's been exceed on the actual landing depiction.

"""I wonder who won""","I'm 57 years old, female, and grew up in the sixties. Most of the time I can't stand watching old war movies because they're so blatantly patriotic, the actors are always making overly-dramatic speeches for the camera, and the Germans are always portrayed as monsters.So, I was stunned to realize I had watched The Longest Day in its entirety, and thought it one of the greatest war movies ever created. I found myself absolutely mesmerized by the reality of the film, especially considering it was made almost 45 years ago. I enjoyed seeing the preparations for the invasion from so many different viewpoints, and the focus on the feelings and thought processes of the combatants, rather than the blood-and-guts of today's films.I alternated between anger and pride throughout the movie. And unlike one viewer who commented on the scene, Richard Beymer's comment, ""I wonder who won"", actually brought a lump to my throat because it was such an unexpectedly subtle reminder of the sacrifices made by so many during war.Truly one of the best movies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Big Budget, Bad acting, little story...nothing in Hollywood ever changes","The Normandy landings was one of the biggest military operations every undertaken. Capturing this in a single movie would be a great challenge. Unlike ""saving private Ryan"", ""The longest day"" is the story of the landings, not a story set during the landings.It is perhaps overly ambitious, but when you consider that it was produced by the same person who was also making Cleopatra, then you will understand why it was attempted.What we get is a lot of bad acting, as each big name star, who was paid only a small amount of money, tried their best to say what they hoped would be the most memorable line from the film.There are some absolutely stunning visuals, great expansive continual shots of a different battles. These are interspersed with rather cheap, cheesy studio scenes.My feeling is that the humour was forced in to make up for the stilted dramatic dialog. The result is rather uneven, but on par with the other big budget blockbusters of the time.Like the big budget movies of today, it is both good and bad. It is not a classic. Some people praise this type of movie because it portrays the history of a moment, rather than impose a story in a historical context (it isn't saving private Ryan or pearl harbour). But ultimately the canvass is too big and the brush too small.It also fails to provide a lot of the real facts for why things happened.

To many old actors playin young warriors.,"As a combat Veteran, I can truly say, for its time, is a very good movie. I seen the movie in 1962. My Dad fought at the battle of the Bulge and my great-uncle died shortly after D-day while on a patrol near there.
Seven years after this movie's release, I was a grunt in Vietnam. I mention my family's service only because of the use of John Wayne as the lead character.
Broke after his financing of his flop of a movie, The Alamo, he demanded and received $250,000,00 for his cameo appearance while actors who actually fought in the war received $25,000,00.
Wayne, unlike many of his fellow actors who volunteered to serve, dodged the war and spent his time making money off of it.
Regardless of my feelings of Wayne, this is a good movie and should be a must watch for younger generations.
Saving private Ryan is basically a spin-off if this film but the black and white filming easily separates the two.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Why l like this movie(The Longest Day),"Firstly, I love this film because of the wonderful effort by the Allies in 1944. From that, we can learn a lot of lesson from German's mistakes to prevent it from happening again. Secondly, this film mentioned the turning point of World War Two in Normandy from both sides of Allies and Germany. You can see the whole picture not just from the European Allies but also from the German's point of view. If you watch this movie carefully you can also learn something happened in the battlefield. In addition to it, the intelligent department, weather forecast department and underground fighting force were described well enough in this movie. Thirdly, the way the actors behaved, the costumes, cinematography and special effects are very good. The soldier’s costumes look like the real one, making someone’s feel that the movie is real. More than that, special effects can give you lots of surprises that enable you to feel that you are one of them in the battle.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the Greatest War Films Ever Bar None!!!,"The Longest Day is one of the greatest war films ever. Bar none. The  acting, the cinematography, the storline and the acuraccy are great. if  any of you fans watch AMC watch the Backstory behind this movie. It's  amazing that it was even made. This is Zanuck's greatest work. The  perspective from the different combatants regardless of their rank is  great. Like somebody else said it did not portray the Germans as  cartoonish evil doers. It gave a good honest portrayal that I wish more  war movies would have. As a history buff I love to see movies from  other countries soldier perspectives. This captures it better than  every other war movie. The only one that comes close is Tora, Tora,  Tora. There is one drawback however and that is the rangers at Pointe  De Hoc. They did find the big guns but,they were further inland and  later destroyed before they could be used. Zanuck used this to show the  futility and waste of war. Other than that is a classic with very few  flaws. The comparison between SPR and TLD are well like comparing  apples and oranges. Yes, SPR has gritty realism that stuns you, but  like another reviewer said, this was 1962 and the movie was about the  entire scope of the battle. It was not meant to be up close and  personal like SPR. Many of us  appreciate movies from different perspctives. This is not a movie you  should not rent. You should own it as part of your video collection.  This movie may appear to be pro-war and patriotic, but Zanuck himself  said he wanted to make an anti-war film. I think he did so  magnificantly. He captured the essence of the book where Cornelius Ryan  said he wrote about the men,not the battles. That is why Zanucks film  is so successful. He captured the men and their feelings, whether they  were American, British,German's or French and what they were feeling  going into one WW2's most decisive battle. This is a Four Star  Classic!!!!",,Anonymous,History
A Good War Film That Could Have Been Great!,"1962's The Longest Day is one ambitious, comprehensive war movie. The care that was put into the film making it as realistic as possible is very commendable. With that realism in place, I think the movie suffered just a tad bit. The movie is three hours long, and there are long stretches of build-up leading up to the famous Allied D-Day landing in Normandy. That said, the rest of the movie works well and I really liked the ambition put forth into the film. The film had the largest budget for any black-and-white film, a whopping ten million dollars (a lot for its time). It would hold that title until 1993 when Schindler's List came along. The film made use of many famous actors from all around the globe-48 actors to be exact!One of the things the movie does differently when compared to other films is that it is divided into different sections. Each section represented a different country and was directed by a person from that country. The main sections were the United States-directed by Andrew Marton, England-directed by Ken Annakin, and Germany-directed by Bernhard Wicki. Every section had their own actors. For example, the American scenes featured John Wayne. There are also some scenes regarding the free French resistance. Unheard of for its time, each of the foreign countries (Germany, France) spoke in their own countries and English subtitles were used. I think this format enhanced the movie as we see what both sides are doing and thinking regarding the war.It's June 1944 and Europe has been battered with an unusual amount of storms. The Allies made plans to invade France with Normandy as their chosen location. On the other side of the coin, Nazi Germany believes the Allies won't make any move because of the weather and if they do, they would land in the French town of Calais. The Germans think wrong, and General Dwight Eisenhower decides to make the move.I was impressed with the acting. Usually if 48 renowned international stars would appear in a movie together, things would get rushed. Give credit to the movie-the actors were used well. No one stood out-and that is the point! If I had to single out any actor for their performance, it would be John Wayne. Who can forget John Wayne going into battle on crutches. But listen to some of the actors in the cast: Wayne, Sean Connery, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, Kurd Jurgens, Henry Fonda, and the list goes on and on.On the technical side of things, The Longest Day works. Even though there are some long stretches of nothing, there are some great battle scenes. The Normandy landing is quite impressive and so is the parachute drop. This was a film that had assistance from people who actually fought in the war, so they filmed the movie to be real as possible. The sound and the visual effects are rather impressive. The movie was filmed in docudrama style and it would make a great education tool. Despite the impressive look of the Normandy landing, it will not hold well when compared to the D-day landing depiction in 1998's Saving Private Ryan.Overall, The Longest Day is a solid war movie. It could have been a great movie if it was not hindered by its length. Some tighter editing would have done the movie favors. The movie is based off the acclaimed bestseller by Cornelius Ryan and he also wrote the script which was a good one. I liked the tone of the movie and how ambitious it tries to be. If you like war movies, definitely give this film a shot.My Grade: B",8.0,Anonymous,History
The D-Day at Normandy,"""The Longest Day"" is an American black-and-white film of 178 minutes running time in a documentary style disclosing the hours of tension before the D-Day at Normandy in the Allies side in England and the German command in France.

"The Longest Day is a docu-drama with heart and has grand spectacle, yet ended up being flat in some places which makes this hard to rate, an essential WWII film","Currently watching Band of Brothers for the fourth time and got the feeling of crossing off another World War II movie and this time it's The Longest Day which is almost three hours long with perspectives of both Americans, England, France and Nazi Germany. The Longest Day was released in 1962 and was shot in black and white, something it won the academy award for Best Cinematography (Black-and-White) for, it also won for Best Special Effects and was nominated for three other awards and one of them being Best Picture. The film is based on a non fiction book with the same name, which itself is based on interviews with a cross-section of participants, including U. S., Canadian, British, French and German officers and civilians. This might have been one if not the first American produced movie which gives a grey aspect of the war, showing different sides and importantly not making the Germans into one-dimensional characters. The film was adapted to the big screen by five people, the novelist (Cornelius Ryan) being one of them who contributed to the screenplay, with; Romain Gary, James Jones, David Pursall and Jack Seddon being the four others. What's worth noting is how
Romain Gary and James Jones were World War II veterans. The film was directed by three different people, I would say the visual storytelling is consistent which is a good thing, the reason being that it's for each perspective country/characters. Ken Annakin served as the director for the British and French sequences, whilst Andrew Marton served as director for the American actors and perspective, and finally Bernhard Wicki for the German perspective.Shot in a docudrama style (with captions identifying the different participants), the film opens in the days leading up to D-Day, told on a grand scale from both the Allied and German points of view.The film features a large international ensemble cast that includes John Wayne, Kenneth More, Richard Todd, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Steve Forrest, Sean Connery, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Peter Lawford, Eddie Albert, Jeffrey Hunter, Stuart Whitman, Tom Tryon, Rod Steiger, Leo Genn, Gert Fröbe, Irina Demick, Bourvil, Curd Jürgens, George Segal, Robert Wagner and Paul Anka.One thing that this film needs a ton of praise for is the authenticity and how realistic they made it, from the costume department to the production design. The filmmakers employed several actual Allied and Axis D-Day participants as consultants, many of whom had their roles re-enacted in the film. They show so much, like the day before with Operation Titanic and their objective to deceive the Germans, thus dropping hundreds of dummy parachutists, noisemakers and small numbers of special forces troops in locations away from the real Normandy drop zones. Then Operation Fortitude. The film really shows why it was a long day, the longest day, in how every small objective meant for D-Day and Operation Overlord to be a success which it eventually was. It takes about half of the run time to get to the big battles, showing how in depth they went into following the Generals, which was nice to see. I really liked how we got to see the other landing sites and not solely Utah Beach and Omaha Beach. The battle sequences during the final hour of the film were terrific, brilliantly shot with amazing sound design. The long take scene in the city (what I'm guessing is Ouistreham) and the battle that takes place there, one great shot!Bosley Crowther of The New York Times declared: ""The total effect of the picture is that of a huge documentary report, adorned and colored by personal details that are thrilling, amusing, ironic, sad [...] It is hard to think of a picture, aimed and constructed as this one was, doing any more or any better or leaving one feeling any more exposed to the horror of war as this one does"". Then we have The Monthly Film Bulletin who stated: ""The Longest Day is a monument split down the middle by compromise. At its best, what comes across very strongly is the feeling of immense and careful organisation that went into the whole D-Day operation, the sheer crippling weight of noise, the simple fact that a lot of people died, and the sense of personal confusion and dismay of soldiers wandering alone through the countryside [...] But the film is, first and foremost, a spectacle, and therefore it has stars-a multitude of them, often with barely a line to speak, and usually with no real part to play"".Whilst Band of Brothers is all about Easy Company, we get to know them and feel like we're there with them, the depth of emotion in every episode just shows how well executed it was. This film, The Longest Day, in my opinion doesn't have the slightest emotional impact as that show or other WW2 movies out there. A Bridge Too Far is a great example of a film which has the same emotional depth like Band of Brothers for example. I think the direction could have been a lot better. But it's hard to create a film which has this big of a story, it should almost be impossible to make, yet they did and created a spectacular film. It's a spectacular docu-drama with the directors placing more emphasis on its historical figures than a great film, the pacing is off at times and seeing this ensemble simply being there and not having any material to work with makes this into quite a forgettable film at times, but if you are interested like me in D-Day and World War II, then you'll find some entertainment in this film. Don't go into this film expecting actors getting a role to play, the role could have gone to real soldiers or amateur actors like how they did it in the neorealist films. Kudos to the filmmakers for going down this route, creating a historical accurate depiction of D-Day in what had to be the longest day for the soldiers. I'm grateful for the cinematic experience, it just wasn't the experience I expected nor wanted, I wanted emotion and sense of loss with everyone who lost their lives. I got none of that, which is something I truly feel in Band of Brothers, for example. Although I have some criticisms, I found this to be an essential WWII film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Superlative recreation,"""The Longest Day"" is D-Day, depicted from all theaters of the conflict, over the course of about twenty-four hours.Cornelius Ryan's book is a collection of stories from survivors in all theaters of the battle. This movie was an attempt at capturing that scope, rather than following one group. D-Day wasn't just a lot of Yahoos hitting the beaches. It was the navy transporting them in huge numbers. It was men flying behind enemy lines in gliders, some capturing vital bridges, others fighting and making it easy for those who survived the beaches. It the ""underground."" It was American, British, Canadian and French (though we have to be careful about that as France was actually under Axis domination and its government was Hitler's ally). It was horror and comedy and tragedy. And the Germans aren't ignored, either. They may not be popular these days but they fought and died that day, too, and they were part of Cornelius Ryan's book.Despite criticism of stars and their ages relative to the real people they're portraying, the movie covers too much territory for the average movie goer to follow it all without familiar faces setting boundary markers. It's the greatest cast ever assembled and they're all necessary.Let's be honest and admit most movie audiences are pretty pig-ignorant about history, and most of the real people depicted (apart, of course, for Eisenhower) weren't well known more than fifteen years after the invasion, when this movie was made.In the twenty-first century, where so many movie stars look about twelve, kids who probably never heard of World War II or think it happened about the time Caesar overcame the Nervii, need these markers. Everyone over thirty is ancient to them, so it hardly matters how old certain actors were. Besides, it's called acting. They may not know John Wayne from Adam's housecat, but this movie was made when movie stars had distinct faces.The big coup of the cast, of course, was the great Wayne, who took the place of Charlton Heston. Other stars included . . . Well, most everyone. The smallest roles were filled with faces familiar today, including Sean Connery (BB--Before Bond), Bernard Fox, Roddy McDowall, and a host of others. With so much going on, no one's role is very big. But as we know, there are no small roles . . . And so many people had a hand in D-Day, and everyone's tiny role was important. So get some perspective. The movie isn't perfect but use it to learn.Sure, I get irritated at seeing Rod Steiger and others pop by for one sentence. But Steiger's sentence summarizes the breadth of the shipping. It's what we need to understand: information.Though ""The Longest Day"" is a paean to the men who fought and died on 6/6/44 (including two of my own great uncles from different sides of my family--I own one of their purple hearts)--it's too broad to give more than a general notion of the battle. Still, that's all people want today, if anything: the gist. It's one of the pivotal events in modern history, but all some people want to do is have hissy fits about John Wayne's or Robert Ryan's ages when they should be paying attention to the risks these men took to free Europe from the National Socialist menace: the men's March against fascism.And it well shows how easily it could all have gone the other way and been a disaster for the free world.This movie is shot in black and white (actually, gradations of gray) for a documentary feel.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Detailed And Historically Pretty Accurate,"How much you like this movie will depend to what extent you like the genre. If war movies are it for you, then this account of D-Day - the Allied invasion of Normandy (seen from both the Allied and German perspectives) - has to be one of the best war movies ever made. It's realistic and completely believable in every way. If you like the historical epic genre, you'll appreciate this. There was great attention paid to details in putting this together, and as far as I can see it was pretty accurate in those details as well. If you aren't into either of those genres, then this probably wouldn't be of any interest to you.""The Longest Day"" features a stand-out cast (figures such as John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Roddy McDowall, Paul Anka, Richard Burton, Red Buttons, - even a young Sean Connery) and the German characters actually speak German (with English sub-titles) which I appreciate, as it does add another heir of authenticity to the story.

Good docu-drama on the D-Day invasion,"The story of D-Day presented in a quasi documentary style.  This is a meat and potatoes serving that lays out the battle plans and shows them being executed, but without intense drama of a top rate war movie.  It works for me as a docu-drama more than anything else.  But as far as action and really capturing the atmosphere of the invasion, I think it falls short.  It had the feel of a civil war re-enactment rather than an intense battle.  I'm not saying we need gratuitous gore, but to really show the battle, we need to see guys wrenching in agony and more bodies on the beach.  We are given the impression that the invasion was not a messy affair.  I think this does a disservice to the people who were there.  Now the good things.  The movie pays quite a bit of attention to historical detail, from the German commanders who were at odds with the furher to the French resistance and even the 'crickets' the airborne troops carried.  One more thing I didn't like is there is a slight bit of comic tone thrown in here and there.  I think this detracts from the serious theme of the movie.

It has a impressively stellar cast, with an epic plot showcasing both big and little stories in the overarching saga of the WWII Normandy landings. It is in French, German, and English, and it will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and groan. Really, this is a terrific movie. I have watched it more times than I can count, and I still love it.

EXCELLENT FILM IF LACKING IN HISTORICAL FACTS,"A great film but as an historical record, majorly flawed. It perpetuates the myth that the British and Canadian involvement in D-Day was minimal. Nothing could be further from the truth.Strategic plans for the Normandy landings were conceived and developed by the British under the auspices of Lieut. General Frederick Morgan. His ingenious plans included the building of the floating Mulberry harbours and the construction of underwater oil pipelines between Britain and France.The Supreme Allied Commander was indeed an American, General Eisenhower; but he had never fired a shot in anger, and all the allied forces on the ground (including the Americans) were under the overall command of the British General Montgomery who expanded General Morgan's initial plans. The Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Arthur Tedder, was British. The Allied Air Commander in chief, Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, was also British; as was the Allied Naval Commander in Chief, Bertram Ramsay.On D-Day, British Empire forces (largely British and Canadian) put 75,215 troops ashore over three separate landings; the Americans, 57,500 over two. To these figures should be added 8.500 British and Canadian paratroopers (who achieved all their objectives); and 13,100 American.Overall, there were nearly 7,000 vessels involved, and of the 1,213 warships taking an active part in the assault, 892 were British. The Royal and Merchant navies provided 137,824 personnel; the Americans, 52,889. Of the 4,126 landing craft involved 3,261 were British; 805 were American.In addition to providing its own supplies, the British provided the Americans with nearly one-third of theirs.
.
On D-Day 11,590 allied aircraft took part in operations; almost half of these (5,656) were flown by the RAF. In addition, 1,800 RAF personnel were landed on D-Day (swelling to 3,500 by 9th June). They and over 800 vehicles were used for airfield construction and the servicing of allied aircraft.Bletchley Park's input was also hugely significant; they had broken the latest German Enigma codes some six weeks before the invasion. MI 5 had not been idle either: all German agents working in the U.K. had been captured before D-Day and many of them turned, so the Germans were receiving false information about allied intentions. The entirely fictitious ""First United States Army Group"" was (apart from its name) the concept of British colonel David Strangeways, the head of Montgomery's R Force deception unit. This ""Army"" under the supposed command of General Patton was designed to mislead the Germans into believing the allies assault would take place around Calais.The American contribution to D-Day was indisputably substantial; but it was certainly no greater than the British and Canadian. It's a pity the film does not accurately reflect this.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Visually Impressive but Suffers from Cliché Dialogue & Bad History,"During the couple of decades after World War II, Hollywood made movies about the war that were really fantasies disguised as histories. Many aspects about World War II are incorrectly portrayed in ""The Longest Day"". First, not all of the German high command were complete idiots. Second, not all the French were in favor of the allied invasion. And last but not least, it was not as easy for soldiers coming from the naval war carriers to hit the beach at Normandie. When it was released, ""The Longest Day"" was probably appropriate for its audiences who were only a stones throw away from the war and probably wanted to see escapist fair. However, 45 years later, the film does not uphold as well against far more realistic depictions of war such as ""Platoon"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", even ""Patton"". Except for a sequence in the latter part of the movie in which the allied forces move inland, much of the movie suffers from too many clichés, too many unrealistic situations, and dialog that has become almost laughable.If someone who had never been taught anything about World War II were to see this movie, he or she might well believe that all the Americans were heroes, the English were constantly ingenious, the French loved Americans (and maybe the English too), and the Germans were a bunch of nincompoops. The problem may go deeper as this is the portrait that is often painted in US High School text books. The picture on this Hollywood canvas is over the top idealism in both directions.It's hard to believe, based on this movie, that the Germans were smart enough to get their uniforms on correctly, let alone almost capture Europe. When the Germans learn of the shrewd moves made by the allies, their reactions remind me of the bad guys in the old Batman TV show. Or maybe Colonel Clink in Hogan's Heros. The Germans either blow their tops (I almost expected smoke to start coming out of their ears) or they dismiss what they're hearing. The movie shows a German lookout at the beach becoming frantic, dropping his binoculars at the sight of all the war ships. When he phones the high command, they at first insist that the allies don't even have that many ships before realizing the invasion is on and they go crazy. And the few references to Hitler make him seem more like a spoiled grammar school boy than one of the most feared men in the world. One officer says that the Führer is having another one of his tantrums.The problem is the movie rarely breaks away from its own cliché rhetoric. The characters constantly talk about ""making history"" and heroism as if ground soldiers would say such things in the heat of battle. It just gets a little much. While the German high command are insulting each other, the American and British high command are portrayed as much more organized and deliberate in their actions. Robert Mitchum and John Wayne who play the high ranking officers at the ground level seemed like they were plucked out of a novel rather than portraying real people. Every line, every command, and every decision is prophetic. And the men obey their commands as if they came from Moses! And every time the allied forces were about to attack, a high ranking officer always prefaces it with a patriotic speech! Maybe that was a motivation to go and fight so you didn't have to hear another one!The actual invasion at the beach is probably the weakest and least realistic aspect of the entire film. In reality scores of men were mowed down by gunfire long before they ever got to the beach. Here, about 1 in 50 seems to get hit by gunfire. I guess the Germans just weren't very good shots. Another rather insulting piece of Hollywood melodrama shows a Frenchman becoming overly ecstatic at the appearance of the allied forces at the Normandy beaches. (I guess he couldn't wait to get an autograph from a movie star, considering just about every major Hollywood talent was drafted into this movie, including Richard Burton and Roddy McDowell.) In reality, the attitude toward the invasion was more ambivalent. There were many French who were not thrilled with the allied invasion, but these diversities are never touched upon.There are some good visuals in the film, and some great shots from above. Overall, a rather mixed movie that has a few moments of interest and a lot of cliché silly lines, and parts that are simply bad history. But as the old adage says, the heroes write the history. Or re-write it.",4.0,Anonymous,History
A great film within its context,"The Longest Day works on several levels - the most obvious being the ""don't blink or you might miss several"" nature of the Star-Studded cast. Much of the cast works very well (Sean Connery's little comedy double act with Norman Rossington is an unexpected highlight). Some less so, and some is just downright tokenism - Rod Steiger getting all of 43 seconds on-screen for example. But overall, it's always a watchable movie - beautifully shot.Some previous comment have surprised me, particularly the assertion that The Longest Day is, in any way, a ""pro-war"" film. I'm not sure if there *is* such a thing, but if there is then The LOngest Day certainly doesn't fall into this category - the scene of bewilderment between Richard Burton and Richard Beymer at the end about the confusion and directionlessness of war is the perfect example, ending with the memorable line ""I wonder who won"".I'm also surprised that a European reviewer should have accused this film, of all world war II movies, of being American propoganda. I wonder how many other WWII films include both German and (almost unqiuely) French perspectives of the war to such an extent that almost half of the dialogue in them is in a language other than English. I find the German sequences in The Longest Day to be amongst the most interesting historically and dramatically.The film is certainly as accurate as it's possible for a fictional movie to be - the list of advisors that it had working on it should prove that - including many people who are portrayed by actors in the movie itself. These include the characters played by Peter Lawford, Richard Todd and Kenneth More, along with several of the German field officers. Little touches that seem utterly out of place (like the nuns procession through the French village bringing a temporary ceasefire) are actually historically spot-on.The final problem for the modern reviewer, of course, is the inevitable comparison between this film and Saving Private Ryan. But, as several other contributors have noted, SPR is not only the product of a different age with a different view of these events - historical as opposed to something which happened so recently that half of the audience are likely to have lived through them. But, ultimately, something usually forgotten about Operation Overlord is that Omaha Beach was merely one battle of a very long day indeed. Americans tend to focus on it because of the death toll, but the taking of Utah, Sword and Gold were just as important to the overall outcome. The Longest Day is a film about five beaches, many battles, and many men - some, as Richard Burton says, dead, some crippled and some lost. It is an anti-war film which proves that you can be anti-war and still celebrate and acknowledge heorism. The heroism of the young American and British troops, falling face-first into the salt water of the Normandy killing grounds. The incredible bravery of the Rangers who scaled the cliffs at Pointe du Luc on and, ultimately, meaningless mission. The heroism of the two Luftwaffe pilots commanded to face the invading armies alone, and who did so (another historically accurate point).The Longest Day is a historic film about a historical event and it should be viewed as such.9/10",,Anonymous,History
"A ""longest"" day that will never feel too long ...","""The Longest Day"" was released in 1962, 18 years after the real thing. This is not exactly what you can call a giant chronological leap for many of those who hadn't been slaughtered by the German artillery in the Normandy coast hadn't entered their forties when they saw it on the big screen, and some of them were even parts of the cast and crew. You couldn't cheat with the subject, let alone romanticize it.And in the writing department, the number of survivors was enough from both sides to provide screenwriters plenty of material to make ""The Longest Day"", a masterpiece of recreation and one of the last war epics of Hollywood Golden Age, with such a testosterone-star-studded cast that the question isn't: which actor stars in it but who doesn't? John Wayne, Richard Burton, Rod Steiger, Sal Mineo, Paul Anka ourvil, Gert Frobe and Sean Connery before they'd star in ""Goldfinger"", it's a real who's who of the male stars of the 60s. And yet what struck me for a film written and directed by the winners is how dispassionate it is.As if it embodied the spirit of that fine generation of young men who didn't even feel they were doing something noble, the directors just tried to get the job done. That it's a team of relatively unknown names is a fitting coincidence for ""The Longest Day"" is certainly the triumph of a collective effort that didn't need the additional value of a household name. Patriotic undertones in the form of triumphant fanfares are reduced to the minimum, and deaths aren't treated like emotional momentums, except for some memorable bits such as the wiping on the paratroopers who landed near Sainte-Mere-Eglise church, a scene shot through the shocked and teary POV of Red Buttons whose life hung with his canopy on a providential gargoyle.I was even surprised by the absence of a monologue about the necessity to triumph over evil, which would have been perfectly suitable for any audience. In fact, the Overlord operation is treated a decisive set of tactical moves, and a logistic nightmare for both sides. What is more remarkable is that these aspects are treated from each of the Allies and German side. The film actually opens with all the preparations set by the Germans under the commandment of Erwin Rommel and before the first notes of the ""Fifth Symphony"" ominously resonate, the Desert Fox guarantees that the Allies will land somewhere in the North coast of France, that's for the mathematical certainty. And whether they pierce the Atlantic wall or not will be the move that will make or break the war.Whatever happens that day is unknown but that day for sure will be the longest. Eisenhower certainly thought the same, he who had a special speech ready in case of failure.The first major obstacle is the weather: would the Ally land on June during one of the worst springs in decades after having stalled for a more merciful May? The Germans didn't believe it precisely because he held Eisenhower in high regards, but there are times where common sense and emergency don't pair up very well. The weather prospects were low but just as the American troops moral after so many weeks of stalling under the British climate... occasional glimpses on the French and British perspective allow us to remember that Europeans have been 'there' for two extra years. The landing was itching everyone and was the talk in every platoon and maybe the Allies should be grateful that the absence of sun kept soldiers on guard.Regarding the portrayal of the Germans, it's interesting that the film doesn't treat them through the prism of their evil ideology but like an army with its own ordeals and that is so remote from the tumultuous headquarters it tries to act rationally. And by being so miraculously detached, if not neutral, as far as warfare is concerned, ""The Longest Day"" actually highlights the military prowesses and turns out to be one of the few war movies that has something to say about war, on a pure educational level. The D-Day wasn't just about crossing a beach but holding positions the night before and like in a game of chess, luring the enemy into the wrong anticipations. If the Germans in the blockhaüses didn't open their eyes wide at the sight of the Allies' fleet, then the mission would fail.And apart from that unmistakable little tune from Maurice Jarre, music is scarcely used, never to enhance the spectacularity of the action. The film in its monochromatic format is a meticulous recollection of every single operation as so many tiny pieces of a puzzle that form the 'big picture' of the D-Day. And so we learn about the little ""click"" signal, the Ruperts, the codes for the Resistance, from obscure mentions of one's mustache to a Verlaine's poem... and in a sort of self-referential prose, we have a Nazi officer who promptly states that they will lose the war because the Fuërher is not to be awakened. Which made me realize that this Day didn't wait for the passing of years' hindsight to raise awareness on its historical magnitude. Eisenhower's name could have lived in infamy...And it is indeed a long day that starts in the middle of night and concludes with a cigar-chomping Mitchum,. But no star ever outshines the other, they're all like little lead soldiers disposed in the right place and right moment, sometimes at the wrong ones, for more tragic effects... but still far from the carnage a certain movie from a certain director about a certain private to save... released 36 years.At that time, fewer directors were even born during the war and as a mark of gratitude, the new generation felt the need to remind us the deadly price of victory. More emotions, more heart-pounding tension, more patriotism, more spectacle... but somehow I prefer the straight-to-the-point approach of ""The Longest Day"".",8.0,Anonymous,History

Not Saving Private Ryan,"Comparisons with SPR are pretty meaningless, as that film was not about D-Day, it was not an attempt at accurate historical reconstruction, and it was made very recently.  So The Longest Day stands or falls on its own. And on its own it is a brave, indeed impressive attempt to portray something that simply can't be done on a film.  Because it tries to show everything, it is inevitably episodic, and unless you know the details of the story first, pretty hard to work out who is who and what they are doing.  So I think it is no surprise that my 14 year old son didn't enjoy as much as I did.But that said, its use of different languages, its lack of American jingoism, some marvellous scenes, and the sheer scale of the whole effort make it worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,History
I like it!,"Making a movie set during World War II is an easy task. The conflict, the stakes, and multiple stories with different perspectives are already set up, both real and fictional. The rules are known, and we know which side is which. It's close enough to modern times to be relatable but far enough to escape modern storytelling problems, like the issue of cell phones. You can even make a movie about the before and after of the war.The basic work has been done for you, and you just need to add your touch to it. Even if you only add the bare minimum, as long as you don't change anything that could mess up what was already set up, you're guaranteed a good movie. The Longest Day, for instance, is a great example of this.The Longest Day is an abstract movie that doesn't have major characters. Instead, it features famous actors in brief roles in order to make the depiction of D-Day more human. It's like Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, just without the poetry and nature. The movie is all about the scale of the invasion and the human moments in between. There's no absolute narrative here, just a cinematic depiction of the event itself.What's even more impressive is how smooth the movie feels despite being made by several directors and written by multiple people. Any other movie would have been a disaster, but The Longest Day is an excellent war film that provides a great experience.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Visually impressive, it still reminds me of THE MUPPET MOVIE and all its shortcomings!","Ha--I thought the summary would get your attention!!!

Both films have tremendous production values and are very well made BUT both suffered from a massive overdose of ""celebrity walk-on fever""--this insane notion that the film should be spiced up with celebrity cameos. And, unfortunately, the opposite usually occurred--the whole tempo of the film was disrupted and too much money and time was spent following these stars in their brief roles. Apparently, THE LONGEST DAY originated this idea--which came into its own on the many Irwin Allen movies (particularly THE TOWERING INFERNO)--one #@^#&#!&^$!! celebrity after another parading across the screen at the expense of the plot.And this is really a shame, as at heart, THE LONGEST DAY is a very, very good film. Its production values illustrate how this was a real labor of love for producer and studio head Darryl F. Zanuck.

The Longest Day,"As the Allies re-integrated a defeated, divided Germany back into civilization, Studios began softening attitudes in war movies to mixed reviews. So too, TLD producer and 20CF founder, Darryl Zanuck, whose use of cross perspectives in the story (USA British French Canadian German) would serve that ameliorating purpose but with poignant personalizations that prove both powerful AND pleasing for the entire 3 hours. Zanuck knew, to make a great D-Day film you couldn't use campy German portrayals, evil & inept (Great Escape), you had to delve deeper, not anti-Nazi, that's later (Das Boot), but human: Pluskat's shock, Blumentritt's disgust, Rommel's candor, Priller's folly.Particularly heavy in pathos among so many strong scenes are Pvt Martini (Mineo) as victim of imperfect planning (two clicks), paratrooper Steele (Buttons), witness to a Sainte Mère Église massacre, the Royal Air Force commando who, in the nick of time, riddles the German attacker of French partisan Jeanine Boitard (Demick) to obliterate in one act of Allied alignment, 1000 yrs of Anglo-Franco animosity, and then GI Dutch (Beymer), not just lost, but a survivor, and at day's end it's what matters most.

An Unforgettable Overview of an Epic Battle!,"'The Longest Day' is perhaps the greatest dramatic record of one of the defining moments in world history. After the intimacy of 'Saving Private Ryan', many critics have accused it of being a 'sanitized' version of the Normandy Invasion, but it is a different kind of film, entirely! While Steven Speilberg's aim was to personalize the horror facing the first wave of troops to hit the beach, Producer Darryl F. Zanuck, a D-Day vet, himself, wanted to create a mosaic of the myriad of personalities, events, and experiences that shaped the day. It is a film that looks objectively at all the forces who fought this epic battle, wisely casting major stars of each country to portray actual and fictitious characters. This was a bold move at the time, as subtitles are used extensively, giving the film has a uniquely international flavor. This is not your usual war film with 'American actors doing funny accents'!There are many standout performances; a few that deserve particular recognition are Richard Burton's war-weary RAF pilot, the last survivor of his original squadron; Dietmar Schönherr as one of the few remaining Luftwaffe pilots, faced with the impossible order of stopping the invasion with two airplanes; Jeffrey Hunter, a young sergeant who is 'Dear John'ed and faces the horrendous Omaha landing; a pre-James Bond Sean Connery as a cocky Irish infantryman; Red Buttons, as a paratrooper whose chute snags on a church tower, and is forced to view the carnage as Germans annihilate jumpers dropping into a French town square; and John Wayne (himself a war film icon), as Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort, the Airborne commander, who impatiently waits for the 'Go' order, then breaks his ankle jumping into Normandy.Filled with drama, humor, and pathos, 'The Longest Day' works on many levels, and is never dull! Over forty years after its initial release, it's semi-documentary style still seems as fresh and engrossing as ever, and works equally well viewed by itself, or paired with 'Saving Private Ryan'.It should be an essential part of your film library!",,Anonymous,History
"The D-Day invasion happened on June 6th, 1944","Three directors, Ken Annakin (Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965), Andrew Marton (Thin Red Line (1964) and Bernhard Wicki (Morituri (1965), combined their directing skills for this detailed depiction of the D-day invasion. The three directors' resumes are not as great as you would think, but when they combined their skills together for this epic, they made an incredible film. Based on Cornelius Ryan's book, who also wrote the screenplay, this film gathers a stellar, all-star cast, headlined by John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. The combined strengths of the filmmakers, actors and crew, created a major motion picture, that is a delight to see. The film depicts many moments of the battle, that many audience members may not know about. They headline the importance of the para-trooper attacks inland, as being just as important as the invasion itself, on the beaches of Normandy.By the time the 1960s had rolled around, black and white film was still being used as an acceptable alternative to color film. However, it was quite clear, that black and white film was entering into its twilight years. By the mid-1970s, color film was king and black and white film was considered part of the old, classic, Hollywood style of movies. Getting back to the 1960s, being as, the end of WW2 was approaching the 20 year mark, many filmmakers decided to still use black and white film for war pictures. Black and white film gave the movie, that old-style look. Film was also still being used for consumer home movies. Video was still almost 20 years away, so your consumer brand home movies were all still being shot on film too. Being as the new medium of television was broadcasting the Vietnam War in color, all across America, the choice to use black and white helped enhance the nostalgic, old-school depiction of your ""grandfather's war"", just like your old home movies did. It was an excellent choice shooting this film in black and white. Director Otto Preminger would do it three years later in the WW2 film, In Harm's Way (1965), which interestingly enough, is another John Wayne war movie.The Longest Day (1962), has some of the most incredible WW2 action scenes ever shot in a movie. They would set up these brilliantly, choreographed, panning shots of fights going on between soldiers, bombs exploding, chaos everywhere, while trucking the camera along for blocks and blocks through these old French towns (yes, it was shot in France). The film explores the wide-screen space beautifully. It is the stuff of legends when talking about this movie. When you watch this movie, one of the most enjoyable parts of it is seeing how many of the actors you can name, that pop up in the film. I am not going to go through any of that. It would ruin the fun for others who haven't seen the film yet. The attention to detail in the film is evident. They even have testimonial and creative consultations from the German's who fought on that day. It definitely is a film, that needs to be seen, plus its impact on back and white film came to the forefront in 1962 and wouldn't be in the limelight again, until Steven Spielberg used it for Schindler's List (1993), 30 years later.9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The Longest Day,"John Wayne may have featured just slightly more than anyone else in this drama, but it's very much an ensemble effort that delivers a film with a great deal of authenticity to it. It's all set around the day of the D-Day landings in 1944. The weather on England's south coast was, in the words of their meteorologist, ""akin to mid-winter"". Delay meant more frustrations for everyone so off they go using just about every form of transportation available - gliders, planes, tanks, landing craft - you name it, as a quarter of a million men (plus lots of sparkling ""Tommies"") headed to Normandy. Meantime, we also see a fairly plausible perspective from the Nazi side of the channel. They've been preparing for an invasion for a while, but are unsure where and when it will come and the apprehension is beginning to take it toll. What's also clear is that the High Command are, themselves, losing faith with the battle tactics of the Bohemian corporal and much less afraid to let it be known. It's now that the story picks up the pace as troops land by sea and air and face the entrenched enemy who are determined to stop the establishment of a beach-head. With bullets flying and explosions everywhere the cinematography, stunt arranging and pyrotechnics really do give us a sense of the dangers the men faced trying to secure a few miles of sand. There's a lovely, short, cameo from Bourvil as the mayor of a small town so delighted to see them that he turns up, suitably sashed and armed with a bottle of champagne to celebrate as the shells drop all around them! Gert Fröbe also finds his milk round become just a touch too perilous too, allowing just a little humour to creep into the story of precision logistics that didn't always go to plan. It's effectively and tightly edited and the momentum drives itself as we see but this one day - no conclusions, not even the end of the end of the beginning. It's lengthy, but each beach has it's own story to tell and the four creative brains behind this project keep it enthralling, for the most part, for a watchable three hours of horror and hope.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"He's Dead, I'm Crippled and your lost I wonder who won","The irony of war is woven throughout the artistic presentation of the most important effort by the American and English allies. The director mercifully spared us from the horror of war yet successfully portrayed the sacrifice and suffering of both sides. Humor is an important part of this movie, not overwhelming but surely relieves the dark negative nature of the subject matter. This was a casting call for almost every successful male actor in America, England, France and Germany. In fact an interesting back-story could be developed about the missing names and the circumstances surrounding their absence. I first watched this movie on the big screen in Huntsville Alabama, in the first release. It was an awesome experience back then. I sat as close to the screen as comfortable. The movie seemed to end too quickly, but the ending was perfect.. He's Dead, I'm Crippled and your lost I wonder who won. An important after thought about this film was that ALL of the actors were alive and some even were involve in the ""D"" day landings, many had lost friends and family in the war. This gave all of them a special respect and honor in doing this film. Something that has been lost with the passing of time.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the Better WW 2 films - The Longest Day,"Darryl Zanuck went all in with this production of the events of D-Day from both the Allies and the German's point of view. He hired every name actor in the book (and several who were not in the book), with John Wayne as an 82nd Airborne officer, among others. Sean Connery has a main role in the film; about 8-10 seconds on screen. Zanuck even hired Tommy Sands, Fabian, Paul Anka, and other non-actor singers and entertainers, just to add more attractions for younger audiences. He didn't miss a beat. There were a few anecdotes that didn't work, but most did. The Army engineer scene with Robert Mitchum was too long, as were a few other scenes. But generally speaking, the film captures the intensity of the event. My father was on Omaha Beach, and he mentioned the only thing he cared about was dry socks after the landing. It is tough on the feet to march with wet socks.Peter Lawford is fine in the film, as are most of the other cameos. Robert Ryan and Richard Burton, however, are quite forgettable. Red Buttons does a good job in a memorable scene early in the film. It is interesting to note, that the lower you go on the rank of the soldiers involved, the more interesting the stories are; with the highest ranking officers having the most hackneyed phrases and situations. An excellent war film and recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Unusual Hollywood movie.,"The Longest Day is a long movie that tries to dramatize the events of June 6, 1944 - D-Day - and succeeds!!!! Here Hollywood actually succeeds in making a movie that stars ... the actual historical event. This is so uncharacteristic of Hollywood that it deserves special notice. Usually when Hollywood gets a hold of some historical event that it wants to bring to the screen, the event itself winds up becoming a mere backdrop to some insipid love story. This movie does not ... REPEAT ... DOES NOT ... do that. How the producers of this movie managed to stay so focused should itself be the subject of a movie. Nowadays if Hollywood did a remake of this movie, maybe one-quarter of the movie would be about the actual event and the remainder be about some dumb and completely impossible love story - for instance an American paratrooper who, of course, had never been away from his hometown until joining the army, and a young French women, who happens to be fluent in English (with a French accent of course), who are both hiding from the Germans while the invasion is going on ... and become guerrilla fighters and then ... lovers!!! (In reality, the French woman would have been a collaborator who would have reported the GI to the German authorities or her SS lover. After all, let's not forget Marshall Petain and Pierre Laval.) That's what Hollywood would do The Longest Day if re-made today. One other thing, it is tempting to compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan. This is like comparing apples with oranges. They're both war movies concerning D-Day, and that's where the comparison ends. What is for certain is that D-Day, June 6, 1944, was one of those momentous days in history that no amount of Hollywood embellishment can trump and that the brave soldiers who stormed onto Omaha Beach were the stars of the story and to portray it any differently would not only be artistically dishonest but disrespectful to the memory of those brave soldiers who participated in the event and in many cases made the supreme sacrifice.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Noble Topic/Maybe Too Ambitious for One Film,"The D-Day invasion was a major event in the history of the world. Eisenhower decided that it was time to join the allies and invade via the beaches at Normandy. This movie could have beens stronger if it had been a little more concise and taken on a smaller piece of the story. It tries to get at virtually every aspect of the invasion from the points of view of five different entities. Granted, it has some incredible performances (and some sort of dull ones), but, again, there were just too many stories to keep track of; hence, most of them are just a bit undernourished. Don't get me wrong. It's a terrific film at time, and they do a good job of presenting that story. The movie is based on a very extensive novel by Cornelius Ryan.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Hideously overrated exercise in tedium.,"Hours of tedious exposition, wooden acting, cliché-ridden dialogue, poor cinematography. It has not aged well and it surprises me to see such positive reviews, although it is a kind of historical curio as it comes out of old Hollywood with passing nods to cinema vérité. It does serve to highlight what terrible actors some of the most popular American actors of the time were, John Wayne is particularly painful to watch, Robert Mitchum also appears similarly challenged in a role that is anything but challenging.Avoid.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"The Longest Day, a day that will repeat itself.","The Longest Day is a film recounting the events leading up to the operation on 6th June 1944, codenamed OVERLORD, where over 2 million allied forces delivered five naval assault divisions to the beaches of Normandy, France.The beaches were given the code names UTAH, OMAHA, GOLD, JUNO, and SWORD and this was the largest amphibious invasion in the history of warfare. The statistics of D-Day, as it is known,are staggering. The Allies used over 5,000 ships and landing craft to land more than 150,000 troops on five beaches in Normandy.Th Germans defending the beaches against this invasion were caught off guard by successful disinformation, and internal command problems.The film recreates the main invasion, and some other less major operations that were carried out simultaneously, but as part of the overall strategy.Overlord has gone down in history as one of the most ambitious and successful invasions ever carried out during wartime, and the film is told mostly from the American view, but also from a British and French view too, and also plenty of screen time showing the mistakes made by the Germans.It's reasonably historically accurate and remains a great reminder of the task taken on by Allied forces from the 12 nations involved and the huge success that was achieved that day.Despite the film being over 60 years old it still stands as one of the great wartime films ever made, and is a source of pride for all of the countries who gave men to the allied assault. It's almost empty of the typical Hollywood smush that we expect now: it's more of a soldiers film, showing the reality and the brutality of war.It would take a whole page to list the major stars in this film, but even the non-stars make a great contribution and the film to me embodies warfare: the glory of it, the futility of it, and the necessity for it. It does make your heart swell with pride when all these men were sacrificed on a beach to free a country and a continent from the tyranny of the Nazis. But it also is incredibly sad for so many men to die for the sake of one dictators vision.It also reminds us that nothing has been learned from it. To this day there is conflict in the world, taking 100's of 000's of lives for the sake of the ideology of a handful of men in power.I gave it a solid 8 because it stands as a historical document.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"a classic,compare it to Private Ryan and a Bridge Too Far but this still stands up.","It is 6th June 2021 and I am watching this film on blu ray.I don't get why people insist on comparing this to Saving Private Ryan.Yes Spielberg's film starts in Normandy but it is a different film to The Longest Day.Private Ryan is a sentimental men on a mission film and I don't find it realistic apart from the first part.The Longest Day is from the book of the same name and it covers a wide range of people and events.It has weak parts but the vast majority of the film is very good.It shows British,French and American units .Sadly there is no mention of the Canadian contribution.John Wayne's character makes a little speech reminding his troops that Britain had been at war for 5 years in 1944.Sadly some of the reviewers of D day films on here don't seem to know the huge contribution made by Britain's army navy and air force in the liberation of France.It gives a fair account of the German side as well.This film contains so many great scenes and although it is a long film it does not drag much.The author of the book also wrote A Bridge Too Far.I find that film lacks pace and is too long.I enjoy most of the star performances in The Longest Day even although some of the stars are not in the film very long.Of course the film is long and in black and white and the style of the film seems dated now but if we watch the film we will learn about the real events which are still relevant.",8.0,Anonymous,History
One Of The Best Black And White Films I've Seen,"The Longest Day (1962) is an Action/Drama/History/War feature about D-Day. The film shows the events of D-Day from the perspective of both the Germans and the Allied forces. The film was great. I enjoyed the acting and the casting of the film. One of the greatest assets of The Longest Day is the movie score. The songs are excellent and add to the plot of the film. Battle scenes are introduced with a beating of the drums.The battle scenes are incredible and detailed. You are able to see dialogue between soldiers that would usually be left out in Hollywood renditions of important battles. You see what happens leading up to the battle, the plans that are made, the things that go wrong, and how the soldiers overcome obstacles and work to win the war. The scenery and acting are so vivid and authentic that you'll swear that you can smell the soldiers as they run through puddles of mud. The shots and bombs are so loud and destructive that you'll jump from your seat.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys war movies or historical dramas. Although this film did not have much in the way of special effects due to the fact that it was released in the early 60s, the director still manages to create an intense and action- packed movie that will give viewers the perspectives of opposing soldiers at war.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Remarkable Work Of Real Genius,"This is a brilliant, brilliant, very good movie. I watched years ago in Poland with Polish dubbing and loved every minute of it, and now finally watched in English with real voices of great cast of stellar actors and actresses who made a very fantastic job. So much has been said and written about this huge production, that it will be no wise to go repeating the many times written things of praise. Anyway, what is really great about this excellent movie? This is not banal, not pompous, not trite or clichéd. Instead, it depicts the war as multi-tiered, multi-faceted affair through the eyes of many simple men and women. What is Really great and really outstanding here, is the way the battle is shown - every little person made their humble effort in winning that horrible battle, and together, they won. The great cast of many actors show us all sorts of people - paratroopers, soldiers, nuns, Resistance fighters, partisans, officers, generals, sailors, miners - and they all commit themselves and do great and unimaginable feats of valor, courage and gallantry. The battle scenes are among the best I've ever seen and they mesmerize with their cold, brutal realism, with their excellent depiction and their impeccable effect. War is all hell, and it is clear here. Much can be said about each separate actor - they all did marvelously here. This is a grand example of a really great movie. Thank you",10.0,Anonymous,History

The Allies invade France while Hitler sleeps,"RELEASED IN 1962 and directed by several directors, ""The Longest Day"" chronicles the Normandy invasion by the Allies on June 6, 1944, known as D-Day when American, British and Canadian forces boldly landed on five beaches over a fifty-mile stretch.What's interesting about this classic war flick is that they used Americans to play Americans, Brits to play Brits, Germans to play Germans and French to play French. In addition, each of the segments was shot by five different directors, including the parachuting episodes.The all-star cast includes luminaries like John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Robert Ryan, Eddie Albert, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Sean Connery, Jeffrey Hunter, Steve Forrest and Roddy McDowall. Furthermore, the opening military percussion-oriented score is superlative. The movie saves the compelling invasion of the Normandy beaches for the last act (unlike the mawkish ""Saving Private Ryan,"" which starts with it).Unfortunately, the movie loses points for the B&W photography, which is inexplicable for such an all-star early 60's blockbuster. There are also some hackneyed or awkward parts, like the scene where a ravishing French woman & her bicycle suddenly appear at the railroad tracks by two skeptical German soldiers. Why Sure! Another arguable problem is that the ambitious scope of the film prevents the story from focusing on any one group of notable characters, which make the proceedings seem like a thrilling docudrama rather than a gripping action/drama.Nonetheless, ""The Longest Day"" is a must to catch a glimpse of what it was like on D-Day on several fronts, not to mention you get to see the proverbial big picture.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 minutes shy of 3 hours; and was shot in France. WRITERS: Cornelius Ryan with additions by several others.GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,History
The best D-Day dramatization,"I like this version of the D-Day WW2 Normandy landings the best. You get to see both sides of the conflict; from the Allied and German perspectives. Unlike most 60s/70s epics, the multi-national all-star cast is actually an asset in this film. They show the various incidents and locations a lot clearer than an whole heap of unknowns would. The characters sound very sincere and involved, with a good mix of comedy and tragedy.This was Hollywood honcho Darryl Zanuck's pet project for an anti-war drama, and it works very well. And the title music by talented music artist Paul Anka is very catchy. Sure, this hasn't got the high gross-out impact for a post-Vietnam audience that certain later efforts do (How could it?); but at dramatizing the situation, this is a lot easier to follow.I would strongly recommend that you try and see the colorized version as it's a lot easier to watch; especially in noticing scenic details and when reading the subtitles. (There's absolutely nothing worse that trying to read white subtitles on a white background!!!)",9.0,Anonymous,History
"It is an excellent film, but with problems on several levels.","The allied landing in Normandy is almost certainly the moment, in the whole World War II, that was most often taken to the cinema. There are, therefore, a lot of films about it. Some are better, others worse. This is one of the most epic, one of the most expensive and one of the best.I'm not going to waste time explaining what the D Day was because 95% of the people who are going to read this review know what happened there, and the few who still don't know, I advise, should do some reading about it before taking this film. This is because the film does not waste time on explanations either. The script, written by Cornelius Ryan, has serious problems: it is quite clear that the whole effort was focused on reporting, very meticulously and rigorously (as far as I was able to see) the landing and its previous arrangements. One thing I really liked was to see several nationalities and military forces that, alongside the British and Americans, also take part of D-Day: the Scots, the Irish, the free French (I miss the Canadians)... but everything that goes beyond the landing report, and which is also part of a good movie script, has been undervalued: the construction of the characters was limited to a series of sketches, when they are not caricatures, the dialogues are cliché or sound absurd and, moreover, the film has no story to tell that goes beyond the war story. It is the epic ""documentary film"" of war, at its best.Another problem with the film is that its a nest of highly regarded movie stars who practically limit themselves to appearing and saying something. It is eye-catching for the audience, and the camera work tried to echo that with frontal shots from that stars, but it sucks for the plot because we are seeing the actor So-and-so, not the character he plays. Among the actors that appear in the film we can mention Eddie Albert, Paul Hartmann, Robert Ryan, Curd Jürgens, George Segal, Richard Burton, Hans Christian Blech. I especially liked the work of Henry Fonda, as the Teddy Roosevelt's son, eager to honor his father's name and memory, and to see Sean Connery, still quite unknown (the first 007 film premiered in the same year as this one) playing the role of a simple Scottish soldier, with touches of British humor. John Wayne is good, but he always seemed to me like a very theatrical actor and his characters sound artificial.Despite all this, this film had the full commitment of its directors, who through it wanted to honor the men who fought that day, winners and losers. That is meritorious. The film has excellent cinematography and an exceptional film and camera work, worthy of the Oscar for Best Black-and-White Cinematography, which won that year. The special, visual and sound effects that were used are also really well done and look great (Best Special Effects it was another Oscar that this film collected). The film has great sets and costumes and an excellent post-production work, where the commitment of all involved is perfectly felt. There is no scene or sequence that seems to be over, or out of place. The film is long, in fact, it is three hours in length, but if the audience gets carried away it will not be a problem.Technically extraordinary, this film makes a remarkable account of the military events it portrays. But the flaws in the script, the poor construction of characters and dialogues, the constant parade of famous actors with nothing to do hurt the final product.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"""You'll have one friend out there...God.""","Detailing the strategies of the British and American troops in Nazi-Occupied France in 1944, during the fifth year of World War II. One of those war epics taking place in the 1940s which is written and directed just as squarely as similar movies from that era, with purple prose taking the place of real dialogue and famous faces popping up just long enough for the audience to recognize them (""Look, there's Sal Mineo!""). Despite an epic scale, the film is full of pedagogic vignettes and subplots involving the French Resistance and the decoy paratroopers lumped together without much style. Critics usually trip over themselves with heightened accolades for well-meaning event-movies such as this (""A masterpiece!"" or ""The greatest WWII film ever made!""), but the portentous drum beat at the very beginning (and the star-sightings within the first 10 minutes) signal what lies ahead: a commercial Hollywood package with a 'serious' side, designed as a war document but really meant for mass consumption. The milieu seems right, and the Oscar-nominated cinematography from Jean Bourgoin and Walter Wottitz is fine, but the dialogue is ripe with overeager passion and the casting is certainly odd (John Wayne drawls his lines as if he were still out West, while Richard Burton appears intermittently to deliver bizarre, studio-set soliloquies on the atrocities of battle). The mechanics of the film are not very engrossing or surprising; there are brief flashes of weary war-time humor and also some beautiful images, but there are no memorable characters or exciting sequences beyond the derailing of a train. Curiously, the movie is timid in dealing with the Nazis (is the word ever uttered?) and in showing the swastika symbol (it gets a close-up near the beginning, but is otherwise tough to spot). The bulk of the screenplay by Cornelius Ryan, based upon his own book, is given over to theatrical vitriol or melancholy, and all human interaction is woefully stilted.

Classic WWII Film!!,"The Longest Day (1962) - CO-Directors: Ken Annakin & Andrew Morton Everyone knows this was producer Darryl F. Zanuck's baby and it earns its place in cinema history as one of those epic style movies that treats its subject matter with the most serious of attitudes. Obviously a war is no laughing matter but, for better or worse, movies tend to simplify logistics while highlighting emotional chords, such as bravery and homemade apple pie. Zanuck, however, wanted the audience to understand the scope and grandeur of an enterprise like D-Day.Utilizing a cast of thousands, half of which seemed to be cameo appearances by major stars of the day, Zanuck presents on wide screen all the action and turmoil that surrounded this turning point of WW II. The ever-fighting Republican John Wayne is there, along with Democrat Henry Fonda, tough guy Bob Mitchum, brooding Richard Burton, sexy Sean Connery and pit bullish Rod Steiger.  Still for my money, one of the best landing on the beach scenes ever filmed.  Sorry Mr.Spielberg. (B&W)",,Anonymous,History
inspires you to find out more,"As i write this, it's about 12:30am in France. Just shy of 65 years ago, some British guys were gliding into France to capture some bridges. Hitler slept soundly, unaware of the brutal weight now bearing down on Germany.This film is one to watch, as it opens up a great swathe of WWII history, and inspires one to learn more about those days. The film watches almost like a novel, in chapters, and skipping around different POVs German, American, French. Yes it is a ""victory march"", but it was 1961 when it was filmed. The US had emerged as a great new power in the world and they wanted to celebrate. There ARE German viewpoints written and filmed about these events that one can track down that DO tell a different story, but that doesn't mean this one is not as accurate as they could make it at the time. Popular history, as they say, is indeed written by the victors.A great book to read, that in a strange way complements this film, is Stephen E Ambrose's ""Pegasus Bridge"". It's a remarkably exciting and well written account of the British glider assault depicted, from memory, about 40 minutes into the film, that began just after midnight on June 6.This film is an entertaining and enthralling 2 and a half hours well spent. On this day I think I'll put on the Longest Day, and raise a glass to all those, but especially those young British guys who, at ages younger than myself, volunteered to be the first to touch ground in Fortress Europe.

Still a great film!,"This movie does a great job of bringing such a massive logistical operation down to the individual level in several of the major components - paratroopers, infantry storming ashore, naval personnel on the ships, the generals trying to plan it all, etc etc.Some have criticized it for not being explicit enough in the violence and others who say that it tried to do too much at once. I'd like to point out that this movie was released in 1962. That was only 18 years after the actual invasion. Hence, the audience knew the horrors of war - they'd lived thru it. If they didn't actually serve in combat, they sure knew men who did, maybe even knew one or two who died in combat. Hence, they didn't need to be shown all the gore that was shown in ""Saving Private Ryan"" cause they knew it far too well.As far as the scope of the movie, one must realize the depth of the operation the movie tried to overview. To do that, the movie had to be long. To give each component of that massive scope a human element, yet provide insight into what it was like for the individuals involved, the movie had to be long and it had to involve numerous subplots to even come close to being representative.And, here we are 73 years on from the actual event the movie portrays and this great flick STILL draws a great following.

One of the greatest American War movies of the '60s,"This is, without doubt, one of the greatest American war movies made in the '60s, along with ''Battle of the Bulge'' and ''Where Eagles Dare''. It's well told from the different sides (Americans, British, French and Germans) and everyone talks in his own language (the French speak in French and the Germans speak in German).The title refers to the D-DAY (6 June 1944), the day the Allied assault the Nazi-dominated France.The movie can be divided in two parts. The first, with Americans and British that complain about the bad weather and about the ships and planes, and the decision of General Eisenhower to go ahead with the invasion on June 6, with the background sound of a clock: meanwhile also the Germans want to take some time because of the bad weather. The French Resistance receive their coded messages by radio and then they start their sabotage plans.The second part starts when the two sides, Allies and Germans, are engaged in battle. My favorite part was the Pointe Du Hoc, because is full of action and thrilling scenes and with few actors that I like; Robert Wagner, George Segal, Fabian, Tommy Sands and even singer Paul Anka, that also wrote the theme song.The scenery is great, from the beginning to the end; the beaches, that today are one of the most famous of France's camping sites, the farms with some animals (cows, doves and rabbits) that are indifferent of the soldiers, and Pointe Du Hoc itself.The music score is also great, especially in the ending credits.Shot in black-and-white and CinemaScope, The Longest Day is the excellent chronicle of the D-DAY, from the preparation till the ending of the beach invasion, with a remarkable line said here by Robert Mitchum ''Take me up the hill, son''.In three hours Zanuck and the three directors (Annakin, Marton and Wicki) managed to tell all the scope of one day in every minimum detail, and with the greatest all-star cast ever seen in a war-movie. There are some, like Rod Steiger, Henry Fonda or a pre-007 Sean Connery that vanish after few scenes, but they are also convincing. While the biggest parts, like Robert Mitchum or John Wayne's, are also good, and surrounded by some famous supporting actors of those years. Wayne's co-stars are Steve Forrest, Tom Tryon and Stuart Whitman, while Mitchum's co-stars are Eddie Albert, Ray Danton and Jeffrey Hunter.I want to talk about the roles and the actors that, for me, were the best in the movie:Irina Demick as Janine Boitard, the SEXY French Resistance leader, that succeed to distract two German sentries.Robert Mitchum as Brigadier General Norman Cota, that never stops to give orders and rallying his men. His lines were the best, and were said with a right dose of cynicism.Tommy Sands as an US Army Ranger.He is the most bold of the Rangers and eventually kills some Germans in pacific state while he keeps company to a wounded Robert Wagner.Eddie Albert as Col. Thompson. He reassures Mitchum saying that the rain will stop. Eventually he is convinced by Mitchum about the fact that the men have to battle despite the heavy casualties.Stuart Whitman as Lt. Sheen. He is useful for John Wayne's men because he gives indications about the locations of the German outposts.Sal Mineo as Pvt. Martini. A brief role because he is killed in action.Sean Connery as Private Flanagan. A loudmouth soldier and always besides him Norman Rossington. Trivia: After this movie Connery became the first actor to play James Bond in ''Dr. No''.Henry Fonda as Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the Brigadier General that arrives with the first landing craft at Omaha Beach.John Wayne as Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort, who would participate in war actions and wouldn't stop to give orders to his men broken foot or not. He is the best actor in the movie.I always watch this movie every 6 of June, the anniversary of the D-DAY. It's one of the best American war movies ever made, second only to ''Saving Private Ryan''. It also won two Oscars, for Best Cinematography and Best Special Effects. And watching this movie, even multiple times is a great experience. Must-see for all war movie fans!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Grand scale if a bit dated,"THE LONGEST DAY begs for a remake -- SAVING PRIVATE RYAN style, of course. This 3-hour, widescreen retelling of D-Day stars a huge roster of then-stars like Robert Ryan, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum plus a quite-young and unknown Sean Connery. Not a drop of blood is spilled, and soldiers who are shot fall theatrically. We spend as much time in the company of the Germans as we do the Allies, which wears thin after awhile, and there are probably 2,000 extras in this early '60s epic. The special effects look pretty bad today, but I assume they were pretty impressive in their time. Minimal documentary footage is included, which is a blessing. The film is in pristine B&W, which gives it a greater sense of reality but will cost it many potential viewers. There are moments where the viewer will feel drawn into the action, particularly in the French commando siege of a hotel held by the Nazis. Some passing nuns give this incredibly tense scene a touch of whimsy. In its own, creaky and ham-handed way, THE LONGEST DAY is superior to RYAN, in that it holds one's attention the whole way through. RYAN falls apart once it leaves the beach.

Nice to have seen him in a scene with Ray Danton. The two of them did not have a scene together in 1955's ""I'll Cry Tomorrow.""Hitler was depicted as the maniacal jackass that he was which was good. He literally was asleep at the wheel during the start of the invasion. Kurt Jurgens, as the German high-command soldier, depicted his part quite well.With an all-star cast, this could not be a study-of-character film and that's what very well may have hurt it.

An Absolute Classic!,"I only just recently watched 'The Longest Day', i thought to myself, this was made in 1962, Im only 22 years old, its bound to be awful compared to the new technology influenced war films I'm used to seeing?.... Absolutely not. This is an absolute gem of a film, telling an in-depth story of the invasion of Normandy in World War 2.It tells the story from two fronts, the Allied forces and the Nazi side. Its packed full of action, brilliant acting and some comedy moments. To be honest i sat watching it, hoping it wasn't going to end.If your into your War films, don't miss out on this one.

Well done semi documentary style with good acting,To present the D-Day invasion on screen from as many scales as it was is a monumental task. Darryl F. Zanuck did it about as good as it could ever be done. He presented it semi-documentary with the right amount of subplots using a selection of some of the best actors at the time in various cameo roles. No one actor is the star of this film. The result is an epic war film that should be seen by any one who enjoys war/military films. The film does not honor one side more than the other but simply tells the story of events that day from the nations that took part.,8.0,Anonymous,History

How easy a war with John Wayne and Robert Mitchum !,"The film could as well have been called ""The longest Cast"" in terms of all the big names showing up now and then, one by one starting with the Duke and not ending with Paul Anka or the german comedian / humorist Loriot in minor roles.

"Hollywood's ""BORDER"" minus jingoism, plus scale. One of those war flicks you must see before you die.","The Longest Day (1962) :
Brief Review -Hollywood's ""BORDER"" minus jingoism, plus scale. One of those war flicks you must see before you die. The Longest Day presents the D-day in grand manners on the big screen. The film has a big cast, including many legendary actors, and some of them have actually seen the incidents happening in their wartime duties. It is directed by three people: Ken Annakin (British and French exteriors), Andrew Marton (American exteriors), and Bernhard Wicki (German scenes), which makes it an engrossing and powerful cinematic experience. You get to see absolutely amazing execution of every event that took place in those 2 days in June 1994, right from seaborne invasions on different beaches to paratrooper attacks in the night to entering the city to retake France and eventually taking over the Germans (the last part is not shown in the film, though). In the beginning, one of the officers comments on ""The Longest Day"" as the day that will be historical. Somehow, the runtime of the film gives you an idea of how long it is. Nevertheless, it does not make you feel bored. The scale is too big to overlook. You can see soldiers fighting, shooting, getting killed, running, entering German dens, and flying on a large scale, and what great camerawork it is. Some of them are one-take and long shots, starting from the ground and then widening the frame from the air, taking a top view. Imagine missing one of the shots and then having to retake the entire scene. How difficult it must have been. No wonder the film won the best cinematography award at the Oscars. The screenplay is engaging, the performances are good, even though you have those legends playing only cameo roles, the dialogues sound real (far from jingoism), and the direction is top-notch. I wonder why this film hasn't been on many of those critics' lists. If I were to make a list or give it a tag, I'd say it's one of those war flicks you must see before you die. Don't just watch it; experience it.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Longest Day,"I agree with the depth of D-Day being captured fabulously by this film. I used to watch this with my Dad on TV whenever it was on. I will always remember the dum-dum-de-dum intro because it was so foreboding. As an adult I've watched it. For the first-time viewer it can be difficult to keep track of all the players because the first 20 minutes or so of the movie certainly throws a lot at you. With repeat viewings it gets easier. It's too bad that we never learn the fate of Henry Fonda's character since Teddy Roosevelt Jr. perished in the invasion but the film does not point this out. The last we see of Fonda is when he is wading onto Utah beach with his regiment. Also, the cast credits on IMDb list Lee Strasberg in a minor role but I've never been able to locate him in the film. Any help with this? All in all, ""The Longest Day"" remains one of the penultimate war films of the 1960's (along with ""Guns Of Navarone"", ""The Great Escape"", ""The Dirty Dozen"" and maybe ""Von Ryan's Express"".)

Popcorn Spectacel,"The Longest Day is popcorn entertainment, no critical analysis of what was going on. Nevertheless the movie gave that what the audience wanted. Movies are made for the box-office not for the critics. The directors developed some trouble to show both sides and one has to admit that in 1962 it was too close after the war to make a balanced film about the events. Who cares? At that time nobody in Germany would have raised a voice to put up a brave front. I read a lot about D-day and I visited the historic sites and find that the film shows the major lines about the day, but not really more, because even the details are not for real. The average soldier is anonymous besides the big shots"" (double meaning) . Well, you have to stay with the victors to have an idea about the purpose of it all. The movie was expensive and filled up with many stars of the time, but is it good? The answer is no as for a historical accuracy. The representation of the German side is simple and incorrect, as if it would not mater at all what was going on on this side.It is shown the invasion from the viewpoint of the Allies. Therefore it is one sided. In retroperspective of a winner there is a lot that is stereotyped. The Longest Day suffers from the ""Hollywood"" treatment of historical events. Some characters are obviously composites; Richard Burton's Flight Officer David Campbell and Eddie Albert's Col. Newton are nowhere to be seen in Ryan's original book, while others (Jeff Hunter's doomed Sgt. Fuller) are clearly fictitious.There are also some unexplainable errors, such as having American paratroopers jumping from British Lancaster bombers, showing how close they worked together as only brethren can do. Again nobody cares. In most parts the film is just a spectacle of no significance, a rowing of episodes, patriotic, heroic  the reality was different. No heroism at all, but the accomplishment of desperation on both sides. I heard original reports of participiants from both sides. They know what happened. This movie shows not much of it. Therefore I say much money invested, many stars exerted  for another Hollywood Popcorn flubdub.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Eisenhower playing himself,"In the trivia section, it said that Eisenhower was actually considered for the part of playing himself in the movie.  I found that to be rather interesting because I wasn't aware of that.  It also said that he consented to do the part but the reason he didn't get it is that the make-up artists couldn't make him up to look like his same young self in 1944.  I find this rather hard to understand because, to me anyway, he didn't look that much different in the early 60s when the movie was made than he did in the mid 40s!

"""Blesse mon coeur d'une langueur monotone.""","As one of Hollywood's movers and shakers, Darryl F. Zanuck possessed an uncanny flair for potential box office success and this could be seen as his pet project, having bought the rights to Cornelius Ryan's novel for $175,000 dollars and presenting it in his beloved Cinemascope format. His money is on display here as well as his mistress at the time, delectable Irena Demick as a resistance fighter. Although uncredited he also directed a few scenes whilst credited directors Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton and Bernard Wicki, together with an international cast, guarantee a film told from the perspective of both sides. In fact gung-ho American General Vandervoort and philosophical German General Blumentritt both pose the same question: 'Whose side is God on?'Considering the multiplicity of directors and different styles involved one must give praise to editor Samuel E. Beetley for keeping the narrative relatively cohesive whilst the camerawork of Jean Bourgoin and Walter Wottitz is simply outstanding. As usual the unsung heroes are the second unit directors and the coordination by Gerd Oswald and Elmo Williams of the action sequences is to be commended. Particularly impressive are the storming of Pointe du Hoc by US rangers and the taking of Ouistreham by French commandos.Some of the cameos by famous faces are a little distracting but a few performances stand out notably those of Fernand Ledoux, Bourvil, Curt Jurgens, Hans Christian Blech, Red Buttons and Richard Burton BC(before Cleopatra) Interestingly, Richard Todd plays Major John Howard with whom the actor actually served in the battle for Pegasus Bridge. The inspiring leadership of General Norman Cota amidst the carnage of Omaha Beach is wonderfully realised by Robert Mitchum. As there is no show without Punch it is to be expected that John Wayne would feature prominently and although his solid presence is undeniable, one could have done without his ''move 'em out'', US Cavalry dialogue.By today's standards of course it all seems rather tame as combatants are killed instantly and cleanly without a trace of blood. Sixty years on however it remains a fine achievement on almost every level.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"The Longest Day is a ""movie"" ... Other than profit, what is the point or the object of a ""movie"" ? ...","It is I believe, to tell a story. That is the crux of the biscuit really, and The Longest Day is a biscuit of substance and flavor that tells a story of events that humans caused and were thrust into that certainly were pivotal in the sweep of human experiences. And so, on this 80th Anniversary of the D-Day Allied Invasion of France, I write this brief impression of the story this movie tells.I have read many of the reviews of others, and I am as always impressed by the breadth of insight and knowledge reviewers reveal. As for myself, an amateur 'historian' and movie enjoyer both, The Longest Day is exactly what the best movies do best: tell a story. And this is done compellingly, with expertise and endeavor by all of its participants, that makes me at least, grateful to learn, to feel, and to understand at least a bit what the invasion of Normandy in 1944 looked like, what it took, what it cost, what happened, in a way that I think is an artistic story-telling achievement that few movies equal, and none surpass.Therefore, I must respectfully diverge from the many criticisms some reviewers describe, that, while accurate or however justified, do not significantly diminish the story-telling excellence of the whole biscuit The Longest Day serves up to movie viewers. I am moved to appreciate the peril and determination and fear and humanity of the participants in the actual events of that June day in 1944, and for me the criticisms of some are crumbs that fall to my plate as I savor the whole of the experience I have consumed.And I in my heart and soul, am better able because of this movie to honor the sacrifice and effort it depicts, in a time of existential evil that might have succeeded still, despite the fighting so many did so much of for so long.There is a moment in this movie that always brings me to a tear, perhaps I am alone in this reaction. And, it is this: when the French partisans in their hideout hear the coded phrase ""Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor"", they instantly without hesitation, stand and acquire their weapons, say momentary goodbyes, for maybe the last time ever, and quickly go out to their assigned missions and their perilous, uncertain, fates. These brief seconds of this movie, well, my wounded heart beats all the stronger for sharing an existence as a human being with people such as these that this story tells us of. It is a story that is accomplished excellently and surpassingly well, and that is what movies are all about.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Who cares if John Wayne and Robert Ryan are older than the people they played. So many actors leave their mark. This is the best part Peter Lawford ever had. The score works.

"THE LONGEST DAY--A Review In Salute To Veterans Day (November 11, 2011)","What is there to say about 20th Century Fox and its legendary and cantankerous studio chief Darryl Zanuck's monstrous 1962 World War II epic THE LONGEST DAY that hasn't already been said? Taken from Cornelius Ryan's excellent book of the same name (with Ryan and various others working on the screenplay) about the D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944, an invasion officially known as Operation Overlord, THE LONGEST DAY shows how numerous elements of planning and chance helped bring about the single biggest military campaign in history, one that led to the eventual end of Hitler's Third Reich. And for this, Zanuck had assembled a massive crew in which three directors (the legendary Andrew Marton for the U.S.; Ken Annakin for the Brits; and Bernhard Wicki for the Germans), special effects men, and a huge cast of Hollywood stars put themselves in service of this epic true story.While certain elements are inevitably fictionalized, notably elements of the landing itself (which, as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN's opening sequence shows, wasn't a cakewalk by any stretch of the imagination), the film does capture the behind-the-scenes planning amongst the top men and officers on both sides of the conflict, including the Germans, whose soldiers are seen accurately in this film as basic foot soldiers just doing their job, and not the goose-stepping Nazi goons in Berlin who sent twenty million people, including plenty of their own, to their deaths. At three hours, this still may be a lot for people to take in, even if their attention spans haven't been warped by the sound and fury of war movies past and present. On the other hand, if the length of the film is a bit much, and the film itself is old-fashioned by today's standards, there is always that unbelievable gathering of Hollywood heavyweights to keep one's attention focused: John Wayne (who, ironically, never served in World War II), Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Rod Steiger, Robert Wagner, Edmond O'Brien, Robert Ryan, Sean Connery (just as he ascended to stardom as James Bond), Roddy McDowall, Red Buttons, Peter Lawford, Richard Beymer, Paul Anka, Fabian, Richard Burton, Richard Todd, and tons of others. All of this was done at what was then considered an exorbitant cost of $10 million (though Fox had poured $40 million into CLEOPATRA at the same time, and almost went bankrupt doing so), and it became one of the biggest moneymakers of its day, as well as the most commercially successful black-and-white film until Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST.Unlike a lot of war films of its time, THE LONGEST DAY, while stirring and stunning, doesn't make any heavy pretenses or apologies towards patriotism, because it was understood that Operation Overlord was an absolute necessity in order to save Europe and the world at large; as such, the gravity of the situation was enough to unite everybody. Those men who fought that day, regardless of their nationalities, are to be saluted for their courage and bravery; and even though it may have been surpassed by SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE LONGEST DAY still remains one of Hollywood's great war films, one to be remembered for many more decades to come.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"""We'll fight them on the beaches, Peaches!""","The Longest Day (1962) -I watched this film thinking that it was on one of the many top film lists that I have been checking off. I am actually flabbergasted to find that it doesn't feature on ANY of them at all. Films like this are the reason I AM ticking off the lists. I want to find things that impress me, that I would never expect to do so and this was exactly what I've been waiting for. A film that showed things from more than one perspective, with the right people in the right roles, speaking the right languages for their character and subtitled appropriately. This is what films like 'Independence Day' (1996) and 'Dunkirk' (2017) should have been. A chance to unite studios and actors across the world to deliver something important, in the way that is correct for each nation and shows a real representation of that country.Obviously this film is a little biased towards the Germans coming just 17 years after the end of WWII, as it would be, but imagine remaking this today, with a fairer view of how events occurred from all sides, including the Germans who may have been just following orders and might have believed that they were doing right. We know a lot more about all factions these days.The only downfall with the real languages of the different nations being spoken was that it was difficult to judge the performances of those speaking them. But that ability to subtitle has been around for a long time, so why don't we use that option instead of getting everyone to speak the same language? I want more reality from my films and that would be a great start.After 5 minutes this film was already better than 'Dunkirk' and it built the tension really well, whilst also showcasing a veritable feast of hotties in uniform.It was a shame that so many of the actors, that are well known to us now, only had small roles. I can only imagine that they ended up on the cutting room floor due to the running time.It is a long film, so don't go in to it if you haven't got the time to see it through, because you'd lose the fantastic momentum that it maintains, but I'd like to have seen more from Leslie Phillips, George Segal, Richard Wattis and many more.And it may be my new found appreciation for him, but somehow John Wayne still seemed to shine out brightly as THE star of the film, despite its ensemble design. Robert Mitchum was a strong character too and I could appreciate the efforts of Richard Munch as General Marcks as well. In fact there wasn't really anybody to grumble about, even Kenneth More, in his relatively small role, seemed perfectly cast and I usually can't stand him. I didn't go much on his beard though.I did feel let down by my history teachers however. Who knew that D-Day was so much more than just a beach landing? It was interesting to watch, even if it was just to see everything else that went in to the success of June 6th 1944. Although classing it as a victory, when you see all the deaths on all fronts still doesn't really feel right to me. Films like this always upset me with the stupid waste of life that war brings. I hope in 2022 that we are beyond such things and yet the news shows differently every day. I wonder when the world will grow up?Some moments of the film actually gave me goosebumps and I felt that I was landing alongside some of them, going along for the journey like my grandad used to do whenever he watched the TV and he would get right up close to the screen. He was actually there on the actual D-Day and I was ever so lucky that he returned home to be in my life.If I had to criticise it at all, I would say that it had a similar problem to 'Dunkirk' in that it was hard to tell who was who? So many of them looked alike and because the cast was so big it wasn't always easy to see which group was winning or losing what.I can't believe just how much I enjoyed this one, it's probably the highest rated war film on my list and only second to 'It's A Wonderful Life' (1946) as the top Black & White film. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in film watching, making or reviewing.It should appear on more top 100 lists. It's far better than some of the ones that I have seen.843.86/1000.",8.0,Anonymous,History
World War II never looked so authentic...,"THE LONGEST DAY is an expensive World War II epic that leaves you with the feeling that you know what D-day, the 6th of June was really like for American soldiers. On the other hand, it leaves you with the feeling that somewhere around the bend another great movie star or film personality is about to make another appearance.It's this disparity between truth and Hollywoodized fiction that struggles constantly to win your attention as you watch what is actually a very realistic depiction of what it must have been like during that fateful day when America lost so many of its splendid soldiers on the field of battle.It's a film that opts for realism, whether it's telling the story from the American point of view or the German--never sugarcoating any of the sequences but presenting the fateful day in an almost documentary fashion with the kind of realism and attention to detail that is awe inspiring.Suffice it to say that all of the names fit perfectly into the scheme of things, never giving the impression that the director chose them at random for star value. Whether English, German or French, all of the roles are beautifully played.With the Fuhrer having taken a ""sleeping pill"", the German commanders realize they are losing the war. Unfortunately, it's such an epic film that it doesn't give you a chance to identify with any of the characters to the extent that you can care what becomes of them. That, indeed, is the film's major flaw.Truthfully, while all of the invasion sequences are extremely well staged for maximum effect, what's distracting is when the viewer's attention strays from the story upon seeing name players pop up unexpectedly in the midst of explosive action. Just a few of the names come readily to mind: JOHN WAYNE, PETER LAWFORD, RODDY McDOWELL, SEAN CONNERY, ROBERT MITCHUM, RED BUTTONS, HENRY FONDA, ROBERT RYAN, ROD STEIGER, RICHARD BEYMER and others. Fox seemed intent on using just about every male star in the business to fill the huge number of speaking roles.Summing up: If World War II war films about D-Day, the 6th of June, are of interest to you, THE LONGEST DAY, from a novel by Cornelius Ryan, is an essential, not to be missed, in all of its B&W glory.",7.0,Anonymous,History

He doesn't act, just screams. He is way over the top almost bordering on hysterica. He runs around the beach like he is out for a Sunday morning walk. Just overplays his part and seems not to really try to add any realism to the whole thing. John Wayne is not much better. He yells his part in and seems more like he is playing a civil war officer then a World. War II officer. He looks too overweight, old and paunchy to be taken seriously as a paratrooper commander.

Saluting Ike and Darryl,"This was a big movie in 1962. It was a time of big movies. Hollywood was trying to outdo television and we were the winners.I was still at school, but I remember when ""The Longest Day"" landed, we had an overload of spectacular movies: ""Ben Hur"", ""Spartacus"", ""The Alamo"", ""The Guns of Navarone"", ""Exodus"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and of course, ""Cleopatra"", which wasn't quite cooked yet, but was talked about endlessly.For those that have only ever seen them on DVD or cable, believe me, they were glorious on the 70mm screen with their overtures and a break in the middle to relieve extended bladders.However, ""The Longest Day"" was the most ambitious of them all.Look at the scale of the thing. Darryl Zanuck was a pushy little guy, but he had a vision for this movie and he made it happen, he was the Hollywood equivalent of a 5-star general. He also saved a spot in the movie for his current girlfriend, dazzling Irina Demick, representing another good reason to liberate France.It all seemed so authentic with the various nationalities speaking their own language complete with subtitles. Before that, English-speaking audiences were used to WW2 movies with everybody speaking English, often with dodgy accents à la ""Hogan's Heroes"".Thanks to Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"", modern audiences familiar with a fair amount of arterial spray can see that ""The Longest Day"" was still adhering to the gore-free Hollywood production code.With that said though, ""The Longest Day"" still has amazing sequences, and they just kept on coming: a spectacular glider attack, a train wreck, scaling cliffs under fire, massed landings on beaches (including wider shots than Spielberg attempted) and an incredible, single-take helicopter shot of French commandos in action.The film faced the biggest challenge when the focus shifted from the spectacular to the intimate, how to avoid movie stereotypes of the GIs, Tommies and French civilians? The answer is it doesn't, but to be fair, many of the stories were straight from Cornelius Ryan's book.Composer Maurice Jarre didn't go for the tragedy and pathos of war in his score; it's a celebration of victory. One of his themes was actually based on the Morse code ""V for victory"", Da-da-da DAH!Much has happened since 1962, but this film gives a pretty good idea about what happened on the big day; you can still feel its power.",9.0,Anonymous,History

It could be potentially disastrous otherwise!However, I wonder if the soldiers on the battlefield could really be moving so slowly, and actually had time to get down to talk about the boots worn by the Germans and why one wore a lifecoat.

90/100Acting/Character: Excellent use of an ensemble cast. We feel for the soldiers and their comrades. 
90/100Did I like it: Yes, all of the merging story lines mixed with the humor and anti-war tone made it very enjoyable. 
100/100Artistic merit: I compare this film to Saving Private Ryan in subject and scale. Very few war films portray the different points of view in a battle.

Great Film To Watch,"Even thought the film is in black and white it is still a great war film to watch and very enjoyable.The film has a brilliant cast that all play a great part in the film,:John Wayne , Robert Mictchum ,Henry Fonda , Ricard Burton , Sean Connery and Paul Anka.However the film does not have the best special effects ,but are good for a old film.""The Longest Day"" shows a good image of D-Day and gives the viewer a great understanding. The film last for 180 minutes and most of that is pure action which creates a great storyline and is easy to understand.So if you like war films ,then you will most Probably love this one.Brilliant Film My Rating : 7",7.0,Anonymous,History
Badly Done War Epic,"I just re-watched this film after many years of not viewing it. I watched it with my sons who are interested in World War II. I have to say that across the board it's badly done. I imagine tackling a multi-national, multi-lingual epic is a tough job but everything about it smacks of being done on the cheap. Bad direction that looks like old staged television shows. God-awful editing of picture and sound. One segment of a German officer obviously standing in front of a green-screen beach comes immediately to mind. The officer just sort of appears and disappears from the foreground as the beach stays exactly the same. The sound of the film is very thin. Almost minimal use of sound efx. Main characters have conversations in the foreground with battalions in the background preparing for battle and all you hear is the dialogue. It really looks like they ran out of money while finishing this film. The black and white photography doesn't age well with this film either. Very washed-out looking film And the acting and direction are very wooden. Viewing this film is like watching paint dry or better yet a slide show on the D-Day invasion.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Great war movie,"I think this movie is one of the best if not the best war movie of all times. 1: it's not a history forgery as so many more recent warmovies, i.e. U-571. 2: The americans speak american, the british english, the french the germans german, makes the whole thing much more realistic. Americans speaking with a horrid german accent doesn't make for a good movie. 3: Making it in b/w works really well as most of us at least have some documentaries from WWII and they're mostly in b/w and since it follows the events quite well, it really works. 4: and it's nice to see how we follow people all over from the GI Joe, the tommy... and to the top level generals. Of course being a movie about a well known historical event once easily guess most of the coming events, but that doesn't diminish this movie at all.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Incredible war epic masterfully directed,"Steven Spielberg's got nothing on The Longest Day. Once you watch this movie, you'll wonder why he felt the need to reenact the landing at Normandy, after Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, Bernhard Wicki, and Darryl F. Zanuck did such a wonderful job capturing the moment thirty-five years earlier. The beginning of this movie is extremely slow, and the first half hour could have easily been cut. The start of the film could have been when Eddie Albert announces, ""Next stop: Normandy."" But after that announcement, it's very good, and the beach scene in so incredibly filmed, it feels like watching a remake would be sacrilegious. There's a long tracking shot where everyone rushes in, machine guns knocking people off, bombs crashing down, chaos in every inch of the frame, helicopter shots that show planes picking off soldiers on the sand-what else do you need? Blood and guts aren't really necessary to capture the horror and seriousness of war, not if it's filmed correctly. And those four certainly filmed it right.It seems like everyone who wasn't in 1962's star-studded epic How the West was Won joined the star-studded cast of 1962's The Longest Day. Except Henry Fonda. He can do whatever he wants, so he was in both movies. This three-hour war drama chronicles D-Day, and as the title forewarns you, it's long. But if you want to see John Wayne, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, Curd Jurgens, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Eddie Albert, Peter Lawford, Rod Steiger, Mel Ferrer, Robert Wagner, Sean Connery, Paul Anka, Christian Marquand, Kenneth More, Gert Frobe, Richard Beymer, Steve Forrest, Ray Danton, Paul Hartmann, Sal Mineo, Roddy McDowall, Edmond O'Brien, Tommy Sands, Peter van Eyck, Richard Todd, and George Segal all together in one movie with parts ranging from five seconds to thirty minutes, you can rent it. Just to warn you, everyone in this movie speaks their native language, so a good two-thirds of the movie aren't in English. The first section of the movie involves the French, German, American, and English bigwigs planning and strategizing. There's lots of subtitles, and if that's not your cup of tea, you'll get bored. Once you get past the first thirty minutes, it doesn't feel so long, because then the battle scenes start.Believe it or not, there's actually a lighter side to this movie. In the middle of the landing at Normandy, a Frenchman rushes up to the soldiers waving a bottle of champagne, welcoming them and thanking them for coming. Peter Lawford says, ""That's most kind of you. Very nice to meet you! Perhaps next time, you see, we have a previous engagement-the war!"" Very dry and very British, but at a time like that, it's nice to see good old fashioned manners towards someone who is so happy to see the soldiers. In the same scene, Sean Connery is joking with another soldier, and his commanding officer, Kenneth More, keeps encouraging the soldiers to get off the beach, since all the gunfire is upsetting his dog. He shouts at them, ""Don't stand there yapping! The war's over there!""If you like watching classic war movies, this is one of the most famous out there. Yes, it's filmed in black and white, but it's just supposed to transport you back in time and add to the realism. And no, there's no blood or guts, but with all the drama and tension in the battle scenes-once you get past the first thirty minutes-there's no need for all those extras. The second half of the movie in Normandy is riveting and incredible to watch. No wonder it took four people to direct this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,History
A very special movie,"As my great grandfather was one of the many men who participated to this historic and epic event, this movie has always been very special to me and my family.Each time my great grandfather was watching or even discussing this movie, all his memories of that day as well as all the relationship he had with great friends he lost on that dirty beach came through. The moments of happiness, the tension becoming stronger each day waiting for big battle, the fear of dying or losing the strangers you learned to know and respect throughout the intense training. This movie had a very special resonance to him and he was very thankful that such a movie was released and even more he was proud that the director didn't take on any side because the Germans were as afraid and respectful towards the men they faced.Now when I watched this movie, it makes me remember of my great grandfather who was one of those heroes, one of what we called the greatest generation. He had the chance to survive this day and the battle which followed and claimed even more lives. So it has also a very special place to my heart.

The Longest Drag,"War movies were thrilling when we were kids spending time in front of the TV at Grampa's in the 1970s. This movie has enough - in the final 2/3 anyway - noise and explosions to keep eyeballs on the screen.Problem is, as a discerning adult your eyes are more likely to be glued shut after the first 1/3. So much ludicrously self-important exposition, badly fabricated dialogue, and cringey comic relief.All the money Darryl Zanuck burned through making this film must have been mostly for salaries and maybe the crane shots of the climactic battle in town. Because there is a disturbing amount of low-rent rear-projection work and hilariously fake studio scenes featuring medium shots or closeups of stars, with one or two extras thrown in if we're lucky.All the stars are hopelessly super-annuated to be in the roles they are assigned here.

The Longest Day,"It's hard to beat a classic war epic. And this movie is one of the better ones. The Longest Day(I jokingly call it the longest movie) is a dramatic depiction of D-Day. It features several stories interconnected during the hours before the invasion. 
It features a great ensemble cast including John Wayne, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda and Robert Ryan. Keep on the look out for a young, pre James Bond, Sean Connery. You can't miss him. The film features some amazing cinematography and the Germans actually speak their own language in the film. The battle scenes are well staged and exciting.

This same kind of thing would later be done in the studio's later film Tora! Tora! Tora! They got tons of big names in here too. John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, the big people in 1962. If you know anything about World War 2 you'll probably know the premise. The epic D-Day invasion of Nazi-Occupied Normandy, France on June 6,1944 by US and British forces, commanded by General Dwight D Eisenhower. The film does a fantastic job of showing us everything on all scales and on every setting of D-Day. That's probably why it's almost 3 hours long.

Tour de force,"An American war film; A story about the events which occured during 6 June 1944 in Normandy, France, the huge task of preparing for D-Day. This film, a grand scale semi-fictionalized documentary of the greatest ever amphibious operation, Operation Neptune, does justice to the military undertaking with its scale and production. As an aside, as well as conveying the logistics needed for this incredible invasion, it takes meticulous care in showing the horror of the events. The composite picture of D-Day from multiple national viewpoints brings an authenticity. The power of the story carries through to the end of its long running time, avoiding gung ho and keeping occasional melodrama to a low ebb. However, it falls a little short of being resonant in the dramatic tension and dialogue was sparse which thwarted the promise of one great performance. This gave rise to the unfortunate impression that several marquee players were rolled out in a star identity parade.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This is a terrible film,"I have read all the post here and if I am given the chance, I would like to explain why I DO NOT like this film. I see it as the ultimate dumb blonde ww2 film, which I have suffered again in the build-up to Christmas 2008. Now, I have lived in the USA and have a very small idea of how they think (at least in the Midwest). I quite accept that they may love this film anywhere in the United States, especially with their armies in Afganistan and Iraq. Hollywood is the US film industry and playing at home to the US public. Europeans have no such loyalty to any film industry outside each of their own countries.My real problem with this film is with the screenplay. You cannot argue that the money and stars were not thrown at it - and that is a major problem. Every name had to get it's 5 minutes on air and the money was there to allow it. Monosyllabic German is subtitled (bar Curd Jürgens). I reserve my harshest complaint for those do believe that this film has a grain of truth about it. Cornelius Ryan seems to have given the dumbest situations possible to stage the action scenes. There are literally dozens of examples of layered stupidity. Nuns roaming through the beaches unharmed. Bagpipers marching from inland to the beaches (and being cursed for being Irish!) undisturbed by the shells falling within their ranks. Then you have the time for American GIs to respond to the slow witted Germans. This brings up the problem of the cast.No stars were included from outside Hollywood. Only the Dutch actors were previously unknown to American audiences. This allows lazy acceptance of the stereotype norms - em, for who? Well, in this case, the American audience. So the Yanks were all John Wayne wannabees, the Brits all Trevor Howard wannabees (even Sean Connery and Richard Burton). The Germans were irrelevant as this is an American victory film. I have no problem admitting that the Allies could not have won the war without the US. It is something Europe will always owe the USA....but that is a separate topic. This film is a celebration of those 'Palinesque' Americans who believe all the dumb stereotypical images of Europe and their peoples. The stars had to take part, or be noted for not being. No depth of character was asked for nor given. No actors or situations were challenging. No questions were asked or answered. Steven Spielberg and others have done wonderful ww2 films, from all the countries involved. This is a very poorly made, expensive, film which did nothing for the career of any actor taking part. I hope I am allowed to hold these views without negating my liking for my time working in the United States, England and Germany.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Incredible War Movie,"Lots of great moments to remember from this movie - the tension of the Allied troops as they wait for the invasion to begin, the slaughter of the American paratroopers as Red Buttons' character watches helplessly, the incredible shot of the charge through Ouistreham, the pathetic irony Maj Gen Blumentritt faces once he realizes that Germany will probably lose the war because the fuhrer must not be woken, the outrage expressed by John Wayne's character when he sees the bodies of the dead paratroopers hanging from their parachutes in the lampposts and trees of the liberated French town, and lots more.There are noteworthy performances from John Wayne, Red Buttons, Richard Burton, and Jeffrey Hunter as the soldier who's recently received a ""Dear John"" letter. Strangely enough, most of the comic relief comes from Sean Connery in his last pre-James Bond role.I like the fact that we got to view the German viewpoint of D-Day and the movie looked so good in black-and-white.

You can't give the enemy a break. Send him to hell.,"One of the best war films ever; The Longest Day features outstanding cinematography, special effects and art work. You really felt that you were present in the time leading up to June 6, 1944, when Allied forces made the incredible landing on the beaches of Normandy.Like me, I am sure many people reading this had family members that were involved (me - a Canadian brother-in-law) in this massive undertaking. To see the story from the standpoint of the men involved was a tremendous experience.Yes, I've seen Saving Private Ryan, and the incredible carnage in the first 20 minutes, but I was just as moved by the same footage in this film without the blood. You felt the frustration of the men and the determination to succeed. Their pent-up emotions after an interminable wait to begin were unleashed on the unprepared Germans. The jubilation of the French citizens displayed gave us a real example of a country waiting to be liberated. (Maybe Bush should watch this to see how it really is when people welcome your invasion.)Robert Mitchum led an all-star cast that must have included every major actor in Hollywood at the time.

The only accurate war movie ever made,"As a veteran WWII historian, I always point to The Longest Day as the only war movie I've ever seen that is actually truthful and accurate.Many war films are merely dramas or a backdrop for scriptwriter political views or to showcase a studio's stars. The Longest Day was NOT your typical Hollywood pseudo history. It contained actors from everywhere - every male actor in Hollywood wanted to be in this film, and a very large number of them were in this film. The film succeeds as history because it faithfully follows the book of the same name by Cornelius Ryan. Of course, a movie cannot come anywhere close to a book in terms of information, and thus there are necessary editing decisions as to what should be included. The biggest failure, in my opinion, is the lack of a clear exposition before the attack of exactly where the beaches were located and which units were assigned to them.If one wants to know the full history of the landings, then the book is where to find it. Nevertheless, the movie does just about as good a job of providing the pertinent facts as is probably possible. Certainly this film makes a mockery of Private Ryan, a totally absurd piece of fiction with an absurd plot and populated by folks who never existed. That film also totally exaggerated the experience, with body parts flying all over the place. The casualty rate at Omaha Beach simply did not live up to its reputation as ""Bloody Omaha."" Only in comparison with the experiences of the other beaches would anyone claim a high casualty rate for Omaha. We landed over 35,000 troops on Omaha on D-Day, and the total number dead was less than 400. And A Bridge Too Far was a totally manufactured event that leaves the audience with more rather than less misinformation after viewing. It was a political movie, not a valid history of Market-Garden. The Longest Day is the real McCoy and also quite pleasant to watch. You don't need to manufacture facts to tell a good story. The story practically tells itself. And truth is always far more interesting than fiction.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"The Dead, The Crippled, And The Lost","""The Longest Day"" is unquestionably a product of self-important Hollywood bloat, but it is also a noble attempt to do justice to one of then-recent history's most singular moments, the Normandy landings of June 1944. For the price of sitting through clumsy expository dialogue, misplaced comedy, and thumb-in-your-eye cameos, you get some terrific cinema and a decent war story.As an opening title tells us, its the fifth year of the German occupation of France, and on both sides of the English Channel, warriors await the inevitable clash of arms. RAF pilot David Campbell (Richard Burton) notes ruefully he is now the last member of his squadron still left from the Battle of Britain. American paratrooper ""Dutch"" Schultz (Richard Beymer) decides if the landing is on tonight, he'll gamble away his sizable winnings and ""jump clean."" An unnamed German officer sleeps comfortably in a French farmhouse, his boots off and carelessly arranged.Much later in the movie, the three men will be found together in a scene that summarizes the film's philosophy at its most pungent: War confirms our universal brotherhood, even with those we kill.Little moments like that are sprinkled throughout ""The Longest Day"". Every now and again, you get something more sustained. There's an attack by Free French commandoes at a casino in Ouistreham that sustains a bird's-eye view of the running battle for far longer than any other film I've ever seen, overall by far the best sequence in the movie. The British glider troop assault on Pegasus Bridge comes off effectively by being played in real time, while a botched U.S. parachute drop on a German-occupied village makes for a harrowing sequence.But ""The Longest Day"" has its share of misfires; too. A lot of times in the movie, we are taken to a meeting room somewhere so the directors can tell you what is happening. The huge all-star cast is about a few stars too many, either unnecessary (Henry Fonda, Eddie Albert, Rod Steiger) or playing themselves instead of their characters (John Wayne, Red Buttons). By the time the beaches are hit, the film is two-thirds over, and a lot is skimped, especially the most effective of the D-Day landings, the Canadian assault at Juno Beach.But the overall quality of ""The Longest Day"" is high, reflecting its big budget as well as a passion for telling the story. Even more than its three sure-handed directors (Brit Ken Annakin, naturalized American Andrew Marton, and German war vet Bernhard Wicki) and numerous screenwriters (including James Jones and Cornelius Ryan, who wrote the book upon which this is based), you have a masterful editing job by Samuel E. Beetley, which sustains the film's galloping pace by keeping less important scenes to the barest minimum. Few films are as long as ""The Longest Day"", but many feel longer. Too bad for Beetley he was up against ""Lawrence Of Arabia""'s Anne V. Coates come Oscar-time; any other year he would have won.It's not a great film otherwise, but it manages to hold up more than not, leading up to that winning wistful moment when Beymer, Burton, and the German come together.

Nor in its cast, impressive, for a multitude of small roles, without a main actor to carry the film.

Authentic WWII film,"A film about just one day, but an important day. The film gives sometimes brilliant, sometimes anecdotal accounts of the 6th of June 1944.Thanks to the personal focuses, involving many personal stories, forgotten details, important decisions, and many other insights, the film manages to fascinate.The film is epic in its scale, with a lot of scenes in which many resources were invested. It is not epic in the sense of heroism, and that's a good thing. All levels of command are portrayed, each one with their own tough decisions to be made.Another bonus is the absence of moral judgment, thanks to the often-lacking German points of view in WWII films.

A Solid Retelling Of The WWII Normandy Invasion Story,"As the Germans waited in France for the inevitable invasion, the suspense on both sides of the channel was palpable. The British and Americans devised plans of great complexity, involving vast amounts of men and materiel. It was a guessing game where they would land and when. An element of surprise was achieved when the first allied forces appeared off Normandy--where they were not expected--on the tail of relentless rain, through fog banks over choppy waters.But the initial stages of the attack occurred during the previous night, when allied paratroopers descended over the French countryside. ""The Longest Day"" does a good job of showing the confusion and mishaps that resulted from the night invasion. And it provides a glimpse into the unintended and accidental nature of war. The effectiveness of the invasion was affected by red tape, egos, poor communications, bad planning and mistakes--just like all wars.Though the film contains some factual errors, it does a good job (for its time) of conveying the true nature of armed conflict, where lives are often lost or saved simply due to chance.A large all-star cast and thousands of extras make this film noteworthy. Four directors under the direction of Darryl F. Zanuck were used to achieve balance in the film by serving the American, British and French interests in the story.For a more graphic representation of that beach invasion, see Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"". But ""The Longest Day"" is a fine film, especially for its time. The ending includes minimal moralizing and some good summarizing, but it feels like a sequel was envisioned. A television miniseries would certainly be welcomed if it could follow the stories of various participants on all sides of the conflict as this film does.",8.0,Anonymous,History

It's told in great detail with more historical accuracy than is usual for a movie based on real people and events (then or now). It helps that it was filmed on location in many of the real places and used military consultants, both Allied and Axis, who had actually been involved in D-Day.

Bringing the book to the screen in style,"Cornelius Ryan's book ""The Longest Day"" was a masterpiece of writing, and the screen adaptation was no less of a masterpiece. The Sixties saw a lot of star-studded war movies (The Great Escape, The Dirty Dozen, etc.), yet this may have been the most ambitious of them all. I would highly recommend reading the book. It will make you appreciate the movie even more. The same can be said about ""A Bridge Too Far"", also written by Cornelius Ryan. Read the book, and then watch the movie again.",9.0,Anonymous,History

A War Epic That Has Never Been Outdone,"The Longest Day includes a stellar cast of 48 American, British, French, and German actors that portray the events leading to the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944 as well as portraying the invasion. Every point of view has been expressed in this film while the viewers can now understand how Nazi Occupation of France fell. Every battle scene is more riveting than the next while the Americans fight many bloody battles, the British clear the paths for reinforcements, and the French fight to liberate their nation. This film shows the points of views from Allied and German commanders, soldiers, and partisans. The Longest Day is one war film that every movie fan should see and enjoy for themselves.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An epic among epics,"WW2 dramas do not get more epic than this. Massive in its scale, involving every nation and almost every operation and type of unit that took part in Operation Overlord. Thanks to this you get a true sense of all the planning, men and materiel involved in the invasion, and how they all fit together. By showing the German side you also see how the enemy feels, and how wrong-footed they were.Not as realistically gory as Saving Private Ryan - such realism would never gave gotten past the 1960s censors - but such micro-detailed realism is not necessary here. The picture is more a strategic one, though you often get to see it from the eyes of average soldiers.Mostly quite accurate, but there are some mildly-annoying inaccuracies. The portrayal of 27-year old Lt Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort by the 55- year old John Wayne is probably the pick of the bunch. Once the action starts, however, the mild inaccuracies are quickly forgotten, as you immerse yourself in reliving an event of massive historical significance.In fitting with the epic nature of the movie, just about every actor in it with dialogue is a major star. About the only male superstars of the time missing are Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Orson Welles! Some of them, eg George Segal, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, have very minor parts and only have a handful of lines, but it shows just how deep the talent pool was in the cast of the movie.Stirring, incredible, epic war drama.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Where's Sam Fuller When You Need Him?,"This is truly a Hollywood War Movie. With its expensive staging and some impressive aerial shots it looks, at times, quite remarkable. But at other times not so much. Some of the sets look staged and are so over lit and glossy they resemble something from the Theatre or Television. These seem irredeemably self-conscious and corny, as does much of the acting and dialog.The Military details and the Historical accuracy, or lack thereof, have been discussed by experts and let's leave it for them and concentrate on the Film as a Film, the Movie as a Movie. In short, its entertainment value and not its value as a Documentary account.As mentioned the long shots are stunning and it shows what you can do with time and money. But this is all undercut by some really shoddy back projections and lackluster troop invasion scenes. Yes, there are lots of soldiers (again, time and money) but they are completely unrealistic and uninspired.The unending list of name Actors fare even worse with little screen time. What motivation and character development we have are dated platitudes, fake humility and bravado, along with some intrusive unfunny comedy relief. There is not one memorable or engaging performance.Overall, it is a sprawling epic and cuts a wide swath that only money and time will allow, but it is all done with a heavy hand, a pandering patriotic pathos, and not much verisimilitude. It is a dressed up delivery of imitative imagination in a noble, but elated production.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Fine adaptation,"To really judge this film, as well as 'A Bridge Too far', one needs to read the book either after or (better yet) before seeing the film. Every time this film comes on, I find myself flipping through my battered paperback copy of the book, especially at the point where Private Schultz decides he needs to lose the $2,500 he won at craps. That actually happened, though there is no mention of him having suffered any serious injuries during training.Probably the most glaring deviation from the book is that the final breakout from Omaha Beach wasn't as dramatic as was portrayed in the film. Those who survived fought their way off that beach inch by bloody inch. It is true that General Cota was very inspirational to his men in the 29th Infantry Division as he tried to move his men off the beach. I was pleased that some of the more minor 'idiosycracies', like Lord Lovat having his personal piper with him, were accurately portrayed, as well as the incident when Lovat's commandos relieved Major Howard's Paratroopers at 'Pegasus Bridge.' That incident was retold fairly accurately, although I'm not so sure about the exchange of words between Pvt. Flanagan and the other Irish soldier, regarding the way Bill Millin played the bagpipes. It did strike me as classic British humor in a time of stress.By the way, one error on this page that might be cleared up. Pips Priller's Luftwaffe 'buddy' and wingman, the one who complained about 'not being able to get any sleep', was no major. He's Flight Sergeant Heinz Wodarcyck, Priller's regular wingman on the staff flight of Jagdgeschwader (fighter wing) twenty-six. Also, Priller's final official score was 101, not the 130-some-odd mentioned in the movie. He survived the war, so it's entirely possible that some of those kills occurred after D-Day. Wodarcyck was killed in Operation Bodeplatte, a major strike coordinated with the Battle of the Bulge, intended to wipe out the U.S. 9th Air Force, and maybe the British 2nd Air Force, on the ground in Belgium. That was New Year's day 1945.",,Anonymous,History
One of the Most Impressive Physical Productions I've Ever Seen,"""The Longest Day"" is a small miracle of a movie. Despite being directed by a handful of different men, it manages to be more coherent and more consistent in tone across its considerable running time than many films directed by a single person. This is not an episodic film in the sense that each director gets his own moment to shine before handing another section of the movie over to someone else; no, all of the variously directed segments are interwoven into a seamless narrative about the events leading up to and taking place on the day of the American invasion of Normandy during WWII.Released in 1962 and produced by an artist of the old school, Darryl F. Zanuck, ""The Longest Day"" sits somewhere between the patriotic WWII films of the 1940s and 50s, to a greater or lesser degree all propaganda films, and those of the 1970s and 80s, which would downplay the heroism of war and instead focus on its barbarity and its toll, physical and mental, on those who fight them. This film leans much more toward the former, but it does dip its toes in the water of the latter by including a couple of moments that ask us to reflect on the sheer horror of what it must have been like to see combat during the World War. Of course, compared to a film like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" its version of the Normandy beach landing looks quaint, but taken as a whole this film is better than Spielberg's, because it rejects the maudlin and sentimental story around which Spielberg anchored his film and replaces it with a much more objective, journalistic style. The film looks jaw-droppingly amazing, a marvel of sheer physical scale. If this were made today, CGI effects would do at least a half of what real actors and physical locations do in this film.The film stars everybody and his mother. OK, so actually it doesn't feature anyone's mother, since only one role in the movie out of hundreds, that of a French resistance fighter, is played by a female. But it's a who's who of male talent, some of them -- John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Ryan, Eddie Albert, Sal Mineo, Richard Burton -- already superstars when the film was released, and others -- Sean Connery, George Segal, Rod Steiger -- about to become so.But the real star of ""The Longest Day"" is Samuel E. Beetley, the film's editor. This is a movie entirely made in the editing room, and it's one of the best examples of the art form ever committed to screen. Beetley was rightfully nominated for an Oscar nomination, but had the misfortune of seeing his work go up against that other little movie from 1962, ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" which won just about every technical award it could. That would have been a tough choice, but I'm not so sure that, much as I love ""Lawrence"" and think it's overall by far the better film, I wouldn't have given Beetley his due.The film did win Oscars for its black and white cinematography (thankfully ""Lawrence"" was in color) and its special effects. In addition to editing, it received nominations for Best Picture and Best Art Direction (B&W), which is also phenomenal.Oscar trivia: ""The Longest Day"" was one of three films in 1962 (the other two being ""The Music Man"" and ""Mutiny on the Bounty"") that managed to be nominated for Best Picture without receiving nominations for directing, acting, or writing, the only time that's ever happened in a year with only five Best Picture nominees.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,History
Casting choices,"The photo of John Wayne wearing a helmet as a Major-General (two stars)on the main page, is NOT from The Longest Day but Cast a Giant Shadow. In Longest Day he was a Lieutenant Colonel from the 82nd. The best part is the casting of Richard Todd, a veteran of D-Day, and the piper with Lovatts commandos WAS Lord Lovatt's Piper Bill Millen. Casting actual participants adds to the realistic feel. I argued with my family about the Longest Day vs. Saving Private Ryan. Saving Private Ryan was a good movie, but it was a fictionalized account. Whereas, Longest Day had many of the actual participants in or providing technical advice. Ryan had better effects(big deal) but if you watch it, it's a cliché' ridden WWII movie just like Bataan or others. Compare the ""central casting"" characters with WWII era movies. The breadth of the battle was compacted in a couple of hours and was an excellent movie, one of the best. The characters came alive and were believable.

Classic from 1962,"We all have seen a recent picture of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and other films depicting the War at Normandy.

I remember seeing this film years ago and I think about all those men and women who gave their lives for this country in order to destroy the evils of Adolph Hitler and his wicked country who allowed this man to have such power and control.

Possibly the greatest ensemble war movie ever made,"There's not much that hasn't been written about 'The Longest Day.' It's arguable one of the best World War II movies out there. It charts – predominantly – the 8th June (or 'D-Day' to most of us) when the Allies finally stormed their forces into France to liberate it from German rule, but the first part (of the film's near three-hour runtime) tells the story of the events leading up to the fateful day itself.The film is generally an 'ensemble' with multiple actors appearing for – in some cases – quite brief periods of time. However, due to the general talent of the actors, that never really feels like a problem. Yes, I'm sure that any of them could have had an entire film made just about them, telling their individual story, but we have to make do with their minor performances. It's hard to pick a 'stand-out' performance as they're all so good.Apparently, according to some who have lived through the day itself, the film isn't always factually accurate (and even a former President of America apparently left a showing due to technical inaccuracies). However, even if some creative liberties have been taken, it still gives a no-nonsense feel of what the troops had to go through when entering the French beaches and countryside for the first time.Due to the film's length, there's even time to fit in some scenes with the Germans themselves. It's important to see what was happening on the 'other side' as it relates specifically to how the Allies managed to pull of the (overall) victory.Of course it is black and white, so for those who find it unable to watch anything that isn't designed for 3D and/or IMAX will find it hard to take! The Longest Day may seem a little dated by today's standard, but, if you're a fan of war films, or are even just interested in what went on during World War II, then you should definitely check this one out.",9.0,Anonymous,History

too many stories,"i grew up on this movie; my cousins and i would pile our GI Joes around the warm glow of the television to watch it on Sunday night and Monday night, since ABC couldn't show it all at one time... and we loved it. it gave us endless scenarios for our fearless troops to play out in the days to come, until the movie faded into memory (at least until the next airing!). then we got educated. we learned history, we read more books, we saw other films, and realized that not many of the men landing on the beaches were Robert Mitchum's age; not many Paratroops were John Wayne's age; most of them were barely out of their teens and not much older than we were in high school. it doesn't pack the visceral punch of the first 24 minutes of SPR, but it does cover MUCH more material in trade. i still watch TLD (i have it on VHS) but wish it could have been broken into more informative, fewer scenarios. i don't mind the odd cameos (Connery's was not truly a cameo; he still was a relative newcomer to stardom) and enjoy Germans speaking German.",,Anonymous,History
Great Film!,"Some people have described this film as bad because of the 'wooden' acting. Surely the spectacle, size and scope of the battle scenes make up for this supposed lack of acting skills.I personally beleive the acting in this film is great, and the multitude of stars is just one reason to watch. Sadly because of the short space of time the movie has, and the number of characters it is hard to get involved with each of the charcters as an individual, as you would in a war film about one or a select few, like Patton. This has to be about the film's only flaw.Albeit the war scenes lack a large amount of gore, in-fact they show any, with men not even screaming when they die. This has to be expected considering the film was made in a time where special effects were not as amazing as they are today.Despite all of this, this has to be my favourite war movie, and my third favourite film all up. I could watch it purely for the battle scenes, but I also enjoy the film because of the way the events are depicted from three positions: those of the Germans in France, the French citizens and the Allied soldiers.I beleive you cannot go wrong with this film. Some of the early parts are a little slow but that is all forgotten by the time the first glider-borne troops crash onto the Orne River Bridge and D-Day begins.A great film, patriotic, exciting and very very gripping.

A Classic War film,"The Longest Day is a epic war film, having three directors, a running time of nearly three hours and made on a grand scale. The Longest Day tells the story and events of D-Day from the British, American, German and French perspectives. There are many story from the Allies deciding on whether to invade, the German wondering where the Allies would invade, the airborne landings in Normandy to capture important strategic points, the bench landings and German commander's reaction to invasion and trying to get the Panzer Reserves into the battle. The Longest Day is a historically accuracy film as it shows all these parts of the conflict and is balanced between showing the story of the British, German and Americans and soldiers fighting on the ground and high command in headquarters. The Longest Day focuses on the military aspects, so threats the Germans and their generals simply as men doing their jobs.

Zanuck did not use any stock war footage, as he stated ""he would not, no newsreels footage.

We had a lot of single and group shooting on the ships and shore with Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Eddy Albert (USN-Navy Cross, Tarawa 1943), etc., but these were cut because after film development, our Sateen Green Utilities (fatigues) when wet after being dropped off short of the beaches, were too dark to double as WW II Army brown fatigues. So, Zanuck had to re-shoot a cheaper landing version with actual U.S. Army troops later that year, and they were criticized by a lot of actors (War Veterans) as not being realistic and frighten getting into and out of the landing craft. Zanuck, did keep to Cornelius Ryan's story as close as possible. My biggest mistake is having read the book in 1959, and had my copy (1st hard back edition) with me, I did not get C.

No stock scenes here - the producers brought in WWII ships, tanks, guns, etc. for an exceptionally authentic look. Three thousand members of the French military were used as extras. Shot in Normandy, France, the scenes are accurate, too. The decision to film in black and white was terrific. Everything is in shades of gray.If you ever get a chance, read about the openings of the film, first in France, then in New York.

A glorious cinematic achievement,"""The Longest Day"" is a towering epic of unseen proportions, even by today's standards, that covered the most important day and event of World War II,
the Allied forces invasion of Normandy against the Nazi in what later became known as D-Day on June 6, 1944. It's done on what one expected that day would
be, filled with anxiety, stress, the horrors of war, all that paved the way for the liberation of France and a significant defeat to Hitler's commandos.It's a massive gathering of legendary Hollywood stars from its Golden Era and also around the world, and that fact alone makes the film worth seeing.Richard Burton, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Sean Connery, Gert Frobe, Arletty, Jean-Louis Barrault, Paul Anka, Sal Mineo, and the list goes on,
as they appear on the three different fronts of the conflict: American, British and German forces, segments given to a specific director: Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton
and Gerd Oswald.It has everything one expects from a classic war film and the usual routine from the stars of the period. Certainly served its intention back in the
day as being an all-star epic picture and it's interesting to watch. But it's one of those things that lose some appeal overtime, specially if you've seen
all the war films that came after this one, most notably Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" which brutally opens with the D-Day. This isn't about the pain
and guts of a battle, it's mostly about reaching out for the glory, and most of our emotional impact is lessened because of the stars presence, even though
they're mostly reduced to cameos. The way most war films expose their reality couldn't been done in the 1960's, obviously, but one can easily watch the film,
if enduring three hours of it.There's a fine representation of all sides, without excessive use of stereotypes or too many cliches, and greatly succeeds in the quieter yet anxious
planning moments far from the battlefield. The sets and recreation of events, set designs are a great treat as well, but must say it loses some of its effect
when you spot some goods, some bad compositions and effects - Rommel disappearing on the halfway of a projected screenshot was insanely hilarious - that for
brief moments it feels like a rushed production.I still stick by a significant - if not emotional - high note as it had everything I wanted and expected from a classic epic - watched exactly on
the 60th D-Day anniversary, broadcast by a small TV company that don't even show films anymore. The recent rewatch didn't impress me much for reasons.But, it was worth rewatching a great testament of what great cinema could be, the importance of its message and legacy about one of the darkest conflicts
to ever exist. The close we ever get from stories like this comes from miniseries as they benefit a lot more with such format. This one can still impress,
but only if you haven't seen much from classic films or war themed stories. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

This magnificent tale is still as relevant and as fresh as it was 60 years ago,"The Longest Day is a magnificent story that is still as fresh and relevant as it was when it came out in 1962. The comparisons with 'Saving Private Ryan' that some of the reviewers make here are not relevant. With no disrespect to Spielberg's achievement, 'SPR' in no way compares to this documentary style black and white film. The cast is superb and there is no way a contemporary movie could include such a high caliber collection of star power and talent because frankly, it just doesn't exist these days. Contemporary film makers seem to be too busy rewriting history to be able to tell it accurately and objectively. Many of the  terrific character actors that sparkle in this film would not be instantly recognized, but their performances shine nonetheless. Such actors as Richard Munch ( as General Marks)gives a bird's eye view into the German dilemma of trying to trace the allies true intentions, which were all too cunningly guarded by an invincible 'bodyguard of lies'. Hans Christian Blech also terrific as a German ace pilot in command of the beleaguered Luftwaffe's  front line fighter squadrons gives an unvarnished portrait of the divide between desk-bound commanders and the fighters who have to make do with too few planes and tanks close enough to the front to do any good. Any military man would give gruff assent to this point of view. 'SPR' is told through  undeniably brilliant cinematography and superb direction, 'TLD' is told by some of the best actors of the 20th century and superb editing. Both are valid ways of telling a story but I must say, that while I've seen 'SPR' at least 3 times, 'TLD' is a film I 'must' see at least once a year, especially at Memorial Day, as one of the only ways ( as a tribute to the sacrifices of these men and women) I can attempt to share the experiences of the many thousands who lived and died on that longest day of days.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Best of its era,"As a movie, this one is definitely one of the greatest ever made. An incredible cast and, for a movie with several directors, superbly seamless.However, it has definitely reached its sell-by date because of the many variations of war movie and changing attitudes to war over the years. This and Saving Private Ryan are the genre leaders for this historical event and therefore comparisons between the two are inevitable.The Longest Day is like a diluted version of Saving Private Ryan - you get a lot more but much less strength. Where Private Ryan chooses to dissect the real effects of war on the individual, this movie shows as many aspects of D-Day as possible to provide a complete, unbiased view of the events (we see the war as viewed from the outside rather than the inside). For example, I think the scale of the D-Day invasion is realised in Longest Day, but not in Private Ryan, where I found the opening sequence harrowing but somewhat like a small commando attack rather than the largest invasion ever staged.A great piece of cinema but, like most war movies of the day, fails to communicate what war was REALLY like.",9.0,Anonymous,History

It's not hard to see why it was such a box office winner, sure it's a touch too long given that a lot of characters don't really have much to do, but performances are strong and the slices of humour off set some of the national stereotypes on show.One has to marvel at the ambition of the production, Fox Studios boss Darryl F. Zanuck spent $10 million to get it onto the big screen, and it shows. Narrative is split into three parts, the preparation, the operations on land and sea in readiness for the Normandy assault, and then the landings in all their powerful glory.

Excellent WW2 Movie,"The Longest Day has been one of my favorite WW2 movies of all time. There is so much packed in that you can see it multiple times and still pick up things you may have missed. The only weak point for me is the casting of Red Buttons as a US paratrooper. Aside from that excellent work from many people some of whom include: Henry Fonda as Teddy Roosevelt Jr demanding to be included in the invasion with his men.Jeffery Hunter - very good as a member of the demolition team on Omaha beach who has to take over when his officers are killed. The movie did a very good job of showing how regular/nameless people like Hunter's character would play such a big part in winning a battle and no one other than the people there ever knowing about it.Richard Burton as the last of the RAF pilots from the start of the war.

D-Day from the Point view of all combatants with an International All Star  Cast.,"First a correction in the credits,  Red Buttons was Private Dutch Schultz, who gets caught on the steeple in the French Town of St. Mere-Eglise.  Second one comment refers to John Wayne as a Captain, he was Lt. Colonel Benjamin Vandervroot, a battalion commander with the 82nd Airborne Division. This ensemble movie is a classic and inspiring story of D-Day.  It successfully conveys the fog of war.  It also shows that the most carefully planned battle still must rely on rapid improvisation. The production values are outstanding and as I write this comment, I feel myself on the Orne River Bridge with the British Glider forces and hear the bagpipes in the distance which means Lord Lovat and the commandos are near by to relive the company of glider-troops who must ""Hold the Bridge, until Relieved."" Private Ryan was the war on the level of the patrol, The longest day included the Invasion of Normandy from the individual service man to the members of the High Command on both sides.",,Anonymous,History
An epic film that chronicles an epic day,"I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release when I was a boy which was the only time I have seen it on the big screen. It of course is the story of Decision Day better known as D-Day, June 6, 1944 and the allied invasion of Normany setting in motion a chain of events that would lead to the end of the war in Europe 10 months later. 2,700 ships carrying 176,000 soldiers land on the heavily fortified German controlled beaches of Normandy. Thousands were killed in fighting so brutal that over the bodies 1500 men were blown to bits or swept out to sea and were never recovered. In recent years Steven Spielberg chronicled the event in his film Saving Private Ryan. In that film you are put directly into the battle and it's graphic depiction. That film couldn't have been made in 1962 before Vietnam. This film, The Longest Day is more of the overall telling of the day. German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel was said to have called D-Day, the longest day of the century. From that quote author Cornelius Ryan titled his best selling 1959 book from which this film is adapted from. Told in three parts, The Waiting as they prepare the invasion, The Night as the allies prepare it's launch and the Germans prepare their defense and The Day of the invasion. Ryan drafted the screenplay along with Romain Gary, James Jones, David Pursall and Jack Seddan. It took an equal amount of cinematographers to film it led by Jean Bourgin and Walter Wattiz the all-French photographic team included Pierre Levant, Henri Persin and Guy Tabary which won them the Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography in the last black and white epic filmed. The film won a second Academy Award for special effects. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Art Direction and Best Editing. This film was producer Darryl F. Zannuck's pet project and he claimed to have directed much of it although uncredited in that role he obviously oversaw it's production and it's use of multiple directors to have so many directors turn out a seamless production. Principal directors Ken Annakin and Andrew Marton are supplemented with director Bernard Wicki and second unit directors Gerd Oswald and Elmo Williams in addition to six assistant directors. Shot in 31 locations in France and Corsica including studio locations everything about this movie is on a grand scale. So much so it required four production managers. Among it voluminous international cast of A and B-list stars are John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, Edmund O'Brien, Rod Steiger, Robert Ryan, Mel Ferrer, Sean Connery, Stuart Whitman, Eddie Albert, Robert Walker, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowell, Peter Lawford, George Segal, Sal Mineo, Christian Marquand, Richard Dawson, Curd Jurgens, Jean Louis-Barrault, Werner Hinz, Wolfgang Preiss, Lee Strassberg, Jeffery Hunter, Steve Forrest, Richard Todd, Richard Beymer, Paul Anka, Tommy Sands and Fabian. More isn't necessarily better but in this case it's pretty good. It runs long at three hours and has it's flaws but well worth the time and some memorable screen moments.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"""We're on the eve of the greatest day in our nation's history""","The ""Longest Day"" is a massive film of the greatest day of the war.  The movie begins with the pre-invasion plans by the generals and the rest of the army.  It shows many of the key officer's plans, complaints and excitement about the forthcoming invasion.  From there the movie recounts the incidents from every aspect of D-Day: the citizens of Normandy, the Germans, the Paratroopers, the troops who landed on the beaches those troops who had to scale to verticle sea cliffs in order to even reach the enemy.""The Longest Day"" won two 1962 Oscars, one of which was for cinematography, and although it is 1962 black and white you can still appreciate the cinematography. One of my favorite scenes from the movie was when Major Pluskat (Hans Christian Blech) is looking out his dugout window and he ses that massive Allies armada appear on the horizon.An amazing cast ensemble.  How many other movies could boast a cast of over 40 international stars. When someone asks you who's in the movie you could go on for a couple minutes listing easily recognizable names.  The leading names in the movie include war film legends John Wayne, Henry Fonda, and Robert Mitchum.  John Wayne leads the paratroopers while Fonda and Mitchum take the beaches.  Allies and axis rivals Sean Connery and Gerte Frobe two years later will team up again as rivals only this time as James Bond and Goldfinger.

The military scenes are laughably amateurish,"I have seen this movie several times over my lifetime. Very little of it is at all credible, as are most war films made by production teams who have not served in combat. The film give a good idea of the logistics involved but the script and age of the actors are huge minuses. The details of how sub-units actually give orders and mobilise into battle are ludicrously simplified. John Wayne is like a comedic representation of an airborne unit commanding officer. There is no impression given of how precisely the landings were co-ordinated and timed and the cameo scenes between generals and operational officers and hilariously poor. How could a regimental commanding officer request his DZs to be changed on the eve of the biggest military operation in history? Years of planning had gone into the overall plan.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty Corny,"I just watched this film again. Although I can't explain why I'm drawn to watch it. It's got some pretty corny acting.In the first place, every American in it seems like they are hunting to speak the historic line of the war. The British,French,and Canadians are almost non-existent. And the horrible over-splicing of action scenes. Couldn't they find real boats and real people,and real water to do the landing scenes?Just picking apart two scenes, let's take the first one: Henry Fonda (T.Roosevelts son) goes to the ward room to see his division commander about being first on the beach. Now,the division commander let's fly about T.R.'s sons father being the first up San Juan Hill and leading the Rough Riders. Wouldn't T.R.'s son already know these fact. I mean come on. If he didn't hear them from his father certainly he picked it up somewhere he was a one star general.Next,John Wayne is in the chute room having a cup of coffee. In comes word about the attack. With so many tables around him, why did he have to throw his coffee cup to the floor? Couldn't he just put it down?Peppered with ham acting the best part of this film was that of the German actors. They seemed to want this movie to contain better then average acting.Look at Major Pluskat. That poor guy caught hell right from the time he was woke up with a phone call. If I was him I would have walked down the hill and surrendered.The only thing shot full of holes here is this film. It can get to be a roar if you see it too many times!!!!!",,Anonymous,History
Arguably the Greatest War Film of Eternity,"**This Review May Contain Spoilers**There are many great war films. They are in a class by themselves, and can never be replaced. However some are the more elite, effectively capturing a time and crucial moment in history we might not have known much about. This is one of them.Darryl F. Zanuck's The Longest Day is possibly the best of the elite war films, and one of the greatest of all time. The key comes from the realistically staged and recreated invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. He could have made it a overly American film, and it would have been forgotten. But Zanuck put his heart and soul into the film and tries to present each side with dignity and honor. And with success.For instance when Pluskat sees the invasion coming, it is darkly funny. But this is not to make Pluskat look like an idiot Nazi, it made it so he is a guy doing his job and frightened of whats coming toward him. Another when Richard Burton and Richard Beymer sit and smoke waiting for the Allies, they get into deep thoughts about the war. They are indeed patriotic soldiers, but they are tired, frustrated, and sick of the war. That is inspired writing, directing, and casting. I believe the greatest moment is delivered by Curt Jurgens at the end when he realizes he won't stop the Allies. The subtlety is unrivaledEvery cast member has his own story and moment, and all is executed flawlessly. it can be a long movie at the start, but once the invasion begins, you are on pins and needles the entire time.One of the greatest films.

Amazingly Epic,"If all you're knowledge about D-Day comes from the excellent movie Saving Private Ryan, you should really check out The Longest Day to see the big picture.  The two movies aren't comparable.  SPR is a close quarters look at how the war effected the soldiers.  TLD takes a epic point of view that explores all sides of the invasion.  Just compare the way they depicted the landings on the beach.  Zanuck's version is a wide camera view of thousands of soldiers running up the beach.  Speilberg's focus's on one small stretch of one beach.  Anyway, this is the definitive movie of the D-Day invasion, as in the ENTIRE day.  SPR is currently the definitive WWII combat movie.I can't help but warn people that you do need to go into this with the aim of learning about history.

Memorable scenes include paratroopers landing in the midst of a village involved in putting out an unrelated fire, and a running attack on a wharf area that has to be the best crane shot since Gone With the Wind!The picture also holds up historically (except for more recent history being a bit kinder to Rommel), showing the German side and point of view as well as the Allies'.

Still, the movie has merit. I like the movie but am very aware of the limitations.

"Grand In Scope, Objective In Approach, And Impressive Throughout","Maintaining a close proximity with the real life landmark event, featuring a massive ensemble, and told on a grand scale, The Longest Day is one of the most ambitious productions of its time that's not only notable for rescuing its studio from bankruptcy but is also one of the rarest examples of its genre that narrates its tale from an objective viewpoint.The Longest Day chronicles the events leading up to the historic Normandy landings on June 6, 1944 during World War II, and tells it from both the Allied & German points of view. Supervised by Darryl F. Zanuck and directed by multiple directors, the movie unfolds like a docudrama and is a 3- hour epic that remains compelling for the majority of its runtime.By allowing the British, American & German directors to handle segments of their own nationality, Zanuch is able to provide the film a much-needed impartiality, and even manages to evoke some sympathy from all the three parties. One can tell the extensive amount of research that went into its production, for some scenes that seemed too far-fetched to be true are surprisingly factual.A major portion of the movie is devoted to the wait, analysis & preparation of the Allied invasion, and Germans' response to prevent it from succeeding instead of the gruesome battle that unfolded on the Normandy beaches. Some moments are disturbing & upsetting, others brim with suspenseful vibes, and few even manage to squeeze in little laughter. All in all, it's a superbly executed effort.Its grand scope is reflected by the massive extras & huge ensemble that show up on the screen, and everyone play their part rather well, except John Wayne who's a tad too full of himself here. Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Sean Connery & many more notable actors show up here n there but their presence never becomes bigger than the story itself, plus the roles they are assigned are cameos anyway.On an overall scale, The Longest Day is a comprehensively researched, brilliantly directed, deftly written, crisply photographed, patiently edited, thumpingly scored & finely performed account of one of the most memorable events that occurred during the Second World War, and is brought to cinematic life in a concise, controlled & calculated manner. One of the best examples of its genre that still carries elements of surprise, The Longest Day lives up to its legacy in splendid fashion.",,Anonymous,History
Lacking Support?,"From seeing this film and from historical accounts, it appears to have been solely a Navy-Army operation. I am not entirely sure of this but this is how it strikes me. Operations in the Pacific were also Navy-Army operations and Navy-Marine operations. I believe at D-Day, the Marines were already using close-air support before many Pacific landings. The Navy was also involved with the use of gunnery as was done at the Normandy landings. It is commented about in the film that Allied Command did not believe the Air Force could do much good because the guns were placed in a position that could best be attacked by the landing forces. However, I feel sure that reconnaissance must have shown much greater detail of the onshore battery emplacements and the locations of German troops. Of course it is easy to make comments with hindsight, but one has to wonder why the earlier, virtually unopposed missions flown by Air Corps pilots in softening up some of the rear areas; why this measure was not applied to the emplacements at the beachfront? Aircraft operating at that time in the European theater included many capable of close-air support as employed by Marine aircraft in the Pacific. I believe it is factual, that only two German aircraft flew one sortie over the beaches that day. Of course the Allies did not know about the placement of enemy aircraft on that given day, but the unopposed earlier missions by aircraft should have been reported and this factor given its proper consideration; seems to me that it dictates the use of the air arm in support of landing troops on the beach. Doubtless if given the amount of close-air support employed by Marine pilots, the number of men lost to hostile fire on the beaches could have been reduced as the enemy forces could have been greatly reduced by fire from aircraft. This action would also have diverted their intentions from defending against landing forces to seeking cover to avoid fire from aircraft. I am not sure when napalm was first employed by the Marines in the Pacific; it might have been later, but can you imagine the devastation that would have caused the enemy along the four beaches the Allied forces landed on?I would appreciate any comments from more knowledgeable persons on some of the historical events I commented about; also any thought any have as to the validity of my assertions. As I said, hindsight is usually 20/20, but the isolation it seems, of these saving techniques remained principally in the Pacific as I know of no action on the European continent that employed this method of prosecuting war against the enemy. I have to wonder and write this in an effort to understand why it was not employed for the D-Day landings?",9.0,Anonymous,History
The best D-day film,"Some reviewers have commented on the comical aspects of the British segment. This is probably because they were directed by Ken Anakin who made many comedy films and maybe humour is a way of relieving the stress of combat. Ken Anakin went on to direct ""Those Macnificent Men In Their Flying Machines"" and ""Battle of the Bulge"" and it is interesting to notice that a lot of actors in ""The Longest Day"" went on to appear in those two films. Also Sean Connery's Irish accent was far better than the Edinburgh Irish dialect he used in ""The Untouchables"" !! The producers seemed to want to attract young cinema goers to the film by using teen idols like Paul Anka, Fabien and Tommy Sands, who would soon be swept away by the Beatles. Indeed one of the faults of war films in general is the use of middle aged actors to portray servicemen barely out of their teens. Richard Burton as an RAF flying officer is stretching things a bit. He may have been one for real in 1945, but by 1962 he was to old. But overall ""The Longest Day"" is the best D-day movie. ""Saving Private Ryan"" may have more realism, but it does not give the overall picture.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Bad Presentation,"I had the misfortune of watching this film last night on the AMC cable channel. Don't do it! I should have known better, because I know how AMC handles their product, but it was late at night and nothing else was on the tube but infomercials.The channel showed this widescreen film pan-and-scan, which is an abomination, first and foremost. Then, secondly, they interrupt the film for a commercial break every 5 to 7 minutes! Agghh! I will grant that the commercial breaks were not that long (2-4 minutes), but, when dealing with a film that is 3 hours long, and has such an epic scope, these frequent interruptions become trying pretty quickly. These frequent interruptions are less irksome when AMC shows Hollywood fluff like action films or comedies (anything with Eddie Murphy comes to mind), which, also, are much shorter, but with an intense, long, epic film like this, they rise to the level of maddening soon enough.I have to say, I stuck with the film since I was over an hour into it and wanted to see it through to the end, but I did so through clenched teeth, and finally went to bed in the wee hours.The film itself is pretty great. Yes, in a way, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN has trumped its beach landing scenario with film-making that seems both more realistic and more modern. But this was state-of-the-art epic Hollywood craftsmanship in 1962, and the subject befits this sweeping, epic approach. Such an amazing topic that the idea of not delving into the characters' personal lives, thoughts or dreams, is an appropriate one in this case. I'm not a John Wayne fan at all, but okay, he's not seen here too much (nobody is) and he does a decent enough job. What I did object to was stunt casting of musicians Paul Anka and Fabian, even if they too had brief roles. They're not so good.Overall, I recommend this film, but get it on DVD, do not watch it on AMC.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The Germans speak German, the French speak French, etc...., for me that adds to the mystique of the film.It was filmed in black and white to add to the newsreel flavor, not to mention make the best of stock footage.

Show it as painless and even good clean fun. Toss in celebrity cameos so that those bored with endless battle planning can just keep trying to spot stars. And don't take time to have any fully formed characters.The star cameos trivialize the war, the soldiers, and their sacrifices. They also really date the picture.

Bias shows,"I saw this movie many years ago and only recently rented it on DVD. For my money this movie is very disappointing, full of cliches, rehashed scenes, cardboard characters, and above all totally biased towards the American military. As soon as I saw that ""Green Acres"" oddball Eddie Albert strutting around like an ageing thespian and John Wayne with his typical gung-ho attitude, I realised my memories of the original film were distinctly vague. This is an awful film, and I have to say the best performances came from the actors portraying the Germans. Maybe it appeals to 10-year-olds, but to those of us who took part in the war, and have longer memories, it's an extremely poor attempt at covering what was a momentous time in history. The British forces too were presented as cartoon characters as is often Hollywood's manner. Compare it to Saving Private Ryan? Well at least in TLD there were British forces present at Normandy. For Americans note the war started in 1939, not 1942 when the ""yanks"" decided to save the world.",,Anonymous,History
D-Day history to share with the kids,"I have watched this and several other D-Day movies and I like this one the best because it has great music and can be watched with my family. It also shows German, English and French perspectives which serve as a reminder that this was a World War not just an American one.I often watch war movies with my kids to help them with their history lessons.  They find it much easier to learn from a movie than from a textbook.  This movie was very good for this because it keeps switching points of view and from the big picture to small individual actions. It is excellently acted and filmed but it has enough slow scenes that my kids can catch up by asking me questions.For my generation it is hard to remember that World War II is really ancient history to today's kids. It is harder for the kids to understand that in this world of political correctness where they can't even say bad things about other people, that there used to be such evil as Hitler and the Nazis. This movie lets me tell them about the horror without them actually having to see it unlike more 'realistic' movies such as 'Saving Private Ryan'.My favorite parts of the movie are the John Wayne scenes where he is at his gritty best.

This opening shot must have been shot from a helicopter but it is very smooth, as smooth as a crane shot. This shot just goes on and on as the street battle begins.

Greatest War Movie Ever Made,"As far as I am concerned, this is the best war film ever made.  I never tire of it and watch it every June 6th. Filmed in a semi-documentary approach and in black and white, I always feel I am watching a documentary of the real D-Day invasion and not a motion picture. The film has more impressive action sequences than probably any other war film, before or since.  Some standouts include: The French Commando raid on the French village, Oestram, the disasterous 82nd. Airborne division drop on Ste. Mere Eglise, the 2 Luftwaffe planes strafing what seems like miles of beaches, the U.S. Ranger Division climbing Pointe Du Hoc, the British Glider attack on Pegasus bridge, etc. etc.  I'm sure that many will be confused by the scenes I have just described.  But if you've seen this film or know anything about D-Day, than you will know what I am talking about. Blessed with an impressive cast (many of whom are, unfortunately, not with us anymore,) including John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, etc. etc., this film was producer Darryl F. Zanuck's towering achievement. This film just lost the 1962 Best picture Oscar to Lawrence of Arabia.  As great as that film was, this is a better and more important film.  It is unreal that these two great epics should have gone against each other. One last thought, however.  Since Saving Private Ryan was released, The Longest Day has been criticized basically for not having the same type of carnage (realism) that Ryan had in its Omaha Beach segments.  However you simply could not do that type of thing in 1962. As great as Saving Private Ryan is, The Longest Day is a film that will live forever.  See it this D-Day.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the Last Films to Celebrate the Heroics of Battle,"Unlike subsequent films that depicted war as hell, Darryl Zanuck's spectacular epic ""The Longest Day"" emphasizes the courage, heroism, and raw guts required to wage battle. Admittedly made about the last non-controversial war in which the United States was involved, Zanuck's film downplays the brutal realism of more recent war movies and focuses on the broad vistas of thousands of soldiers storming the Normandy Beaches on June 6, 1944. Employing dozens of well-known actors in small parts, ""The Longest Day"" effectively utilizes the cameo approach to help viewers keep track of characters in the complex cutting between scenes that depict American, British, and German military personnel both on and off the battlefield. While a cast of unknowns would have enhanced the otherwise documentary-style approach, the audience would have been lost as to who was who. Among the large cast, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, no strangers to war film heroics, register strongest, although Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Edmund O'Brien, Jeffrey Hunter, and Richard Beymer are also memorable. The bevy of rock and roll stars that includes Fabian and Paul Anka will be unrecognizable to younger viewers and illustrates the dangers of casting those with fleeting fame in a movie intended to be seen over the decades. Only one actress, Irina Demick, appears among the otherwise entirely male cast. Her credibility, however, as a French resistance fighter is severely undercut by her carefully applied makeup and perfectly coiffed hair.The stunning black and white cinematography creates bold and beautiful images of the battle, which was filmed on the beaches where it took place. One incredible uncut helicopter shot follows a platoon down the streets of a French town, around the harbor, and into an encounter with another platoon on the other side of the town. The logistics of setting up the shot must have been awesome in the days before CGI. Although three directors were used, evidently producer Zanuck was the guiding force, and the result is a seamless film with few blunders. Unfortunately, the screenplay at times relies on expository dialog to identify characters or to set up a scene, and occasionally an obvious attempt at ""meaning"" creeps into such lines as ""I wonder who won?"" The stirring march penned by Paul Anka may be too up-tempo and enthusiastic to underscore the depiction of a day when thousands died, but the music does emphasize the producer's intent to celebrate a great victory. However, the addition of insipid lyrics over the closing credits goes too far in trivializing a weighty subject. Nevertheless, ""The Longest Day"" remains a fine tribute to the men who fought on D-Day and does a credible job of remaining faithful to the facts without embellishing them with the kind of fanciful fiction that marred another filmed depiction of the battle.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Classic war film.,"This is the only film I have ever recorded off TV and kept.  Kept even after moving house a half dozen times, kept even when I've not got a blank tape anywhere in the house to record something on.This is a big movie.  Big stars, big shots, big script.  Anything dealing with D-day has to be.  And though it is gung-ho in places, you still get to see the truth behind the invasion of France by the allies: it was almost lost on the first day.  It cost lives.  People died.  And that, for me, makes it a war film which puts it all in perspective.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Beginning Of The End Of The Thousand-Year Reich,"No one will tune into this, one of the greatest and most epic war films ever conceived, for plot surprises, given the fact that it details an event whose outcome is of course already known.  The point of the film is to detail what actually happened on the day that began the eventual downfall of the Thousand-Year Reich, and it does so with a rare combination of painstaking historical accuracy and Hollywood star power.The historical documentary aspect of the film is best shown in the German scenes, given the general lack of familiarity of the German performers and their characters on the part of the audience.  Most will probably recognize Erwin Rommel and some may recognize Karl Gerd Von Runstedt, but it is doubtful most will know who Werner Pluskat or Josef ""Pips"" Priller or Gunther Blumentritt were (though James Bond fans will recognize Curt Jurgens, here playing Blumentritt).  Given this general lack of audience familiarity, the German scenes move along like a documentary.It is in the American and some of the British scenes that the Hollywood star power of the film comes into play.  Darryl F. Zanuck assembled the most ambitious cast in memory and all the major stars get quality screen time, from John Wayne and Robert Mitchum on down.  Roddy McDowell is best known for the mild British accent he imbued to so many of his roles, so much so that it takes a few viewings to recognize him as an American grunt. Richard Burton has only two scenes in the film, but he makes the most of them and has the strongest dialogue, notably in his conversation with an 82nd Airborne paratrooper - ""He's dead, I'm crippled, you're lost, I supposed that's what war is"" is one of the best lines in any film ever.Sean Connery would soon become famous as James Bond, and here he eats up the scenery with Norman Rossington as they land on the beaches, Connery chewing out the fact that an officer rallies the troops to remember Dunkirk even though he was not in the service at the time, and Rossington commenting on some of the absurdities involved in this battle - ""I tell you, there are some very peculiar blokes on this beach.""The one scene I had a problem with is the assault on Pointe Du Hoc - the film notes that German guns that have been firing on the other beaches have been moved, and makes it out like the Army Rangers assaulted the hill for nothing; in actuality the Rangers tracked down the guns initially deployed at Pointe Du Hoc and destroyed them as they tried to besiege Allied Forces further inland.My favorite scenes are the travails of the 82nd Airborne batallion led by John Wayne's Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort, and the squabbles between Luftwaffe commandant Wolfgang Hager and hotheaded ace Colonel Josef ""Pips"" Priller.  Hager and Priller haggle it out on the telephone constantly, leading Hager's XO to ask why Priller was never court-martialled. Meanwhile, Vandervoort leads the drive to St. Mere-Eglise, despite breaking his foot in the swamp area the Germans have flooded five miles away - when he and the batallion discover they're going in the wrong direction because a directional sign was turned around, Vandervoort growls, ""Does anyone in this outfit read a compass besides me?""The 82nd also figures in the film's signature horror - the slaughter of a batallion, here including comedian Red Buttons, who is brilliant as the 82nd private who is concerned with speaking French but who can only watch helplessly as his pals land in the middle of the town and are wiped out by the waiting Germans, amid the din of church bells.Without question this film ranks as among the very best war epics ever put to film.  Whether shown in its original B&W format or colorized (unlike many other colorized films this one loses nothing in the switch from B&W) it tells a chilling historical story to near-perfection.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Great Movie, New DVD Release","I saw this movie when it first came out (yes, I am THAT old!), bought it for $75 when it first came out on video tape and just purchased a DVD set at Wal-Mart marked as a ""Cinema Classics Collection"".The movie itself is outstanding in most aspects. For younger people, please understand that when this movie was made, many of the participants in the actual event were still alive. Many contributed in some way to the movie and others would have commented strongly if they saw something wrong. That had to put tremendous pressure on the producers. The only complaint I ever had with it was technical in nature. Much of the equipment worn by the American soldiers is incorrect. It is not that it isn't WWII equipment (it is) but that it wasn't appropriate to what the soldier was doing or carrying as a weapon. I have also read that the action on the beach is spectacular but not quite correct as most of the movement off Omaha Beach early in the day was in small groups like depicted in ""Saving Private Ryan"". I forgive the movie both glitches as it was more important to put Ryan's book on the screen rather than sweat the small stuff.One bit of trivia I learned years later by reading one of Ambrose's books had to do with Richard Todd who played Major Howard taking ""Pegasus Bridge"". If Todd looks believable in the role, it turns out that there is a very good reason for that. It seems Todd was a young officer in one of the British Parachute Battalions that dropped into Normandie in support of Howard's capture of the bridge.Regarding the DVD release I just bought, I have to comment on the 'historical commentary' section. This is a feature that you can turn on and a ""historian"" comments as you watch the movie. I was highly disappointed in the comments. Instead of real history, all it contains is a lot of movie commentary and social statements. If you choose to listen to the ""Audio Commentary by Historian X X"" on this set, please read Ryan's book afterward or one of Ambrose's books to correct what you have listened to on the DVD. I normally wouldn't include such a negative section but it really angered me what they termed 'historical commentary'. If it had been labeled anything but 'historical' I would not have minded. That is why I am sometimes called ""History Nut"".",9.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty good to me!,"I think too many of us read so much into a movie or forget the audience and passions of the time. Yes this was an American propaganda movie--we need more of that today! There are only a few two hour-plus movies I can tolerate and this is one of them. And for those that feel there are too many stars in this film, that is the reason its easy and fun to follow for three hours. It reminds me in that way of Tombstone--each star brought his own personality to the party--thus making it fun to watch. I actually commend the producers /directors ability to bring all these guys together--and I'm sure the stars had fun doing it also.It lacked the blood and gore of Saving Private Ryan but then again look at the original audience and era. Does a movie have to have gore and sex to be accepted today as good?I cant say what is a favorite part but I uniquely enjoyed the look of jubilation on the French farmers face when the fleet began bombing the shore.

Truly Successful,"'The Longest Day', also known as D-Day, is a film produced by Darryl F. Zanuck in 1962. It described a battle between the Axis and the Allies in the Second World War.This movie is a vivid, hour-by-hour re-creation of the Normandy landing. Featuring actors were coming from Britain, American, France and Germany. This movie had won two Oscars, and ranked as one of Hollywood's truly great war films.On June 6, 1944 the Allied Invasion of France had marked the beginning of the end of Nazi domination over Europe. The attack involved 3,000,000 men, 11,000 planes and 4,000 ships, which comprising the largest armada the world has ever seen.The Second World War was started in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. The United States, Britain and France declared war after Germany's aggression.During this battle both Axis and Allies lost many soldiers. However, when the Allies gained Normandy, the Axis directly lost France and Allies gained the confidence to win the War.It is a very old film in black and white colour, and it was already a great film in the 1960's, even without modern technology. To me this is a very good movie because I can see clearly what D-Day's was like. It contained quite a lot of historical facts during the Second World War which. Moreover, the director successfully described through the actors the lives and feelings of people during the Second World War.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Inspired Epic,"My original review was written in 2003. I feel I should expand it to at least 10 lines since the first one was so brief and especially since this is Veteran's Day.I am a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces but I naturally I never encountered anything like the Normandy invasion on June 6, 1944. When I was growing up in the 70's, calendars still had little icons denoting D-Day, VE-Day, and VJ-Day. Apparently, that's too politically incorrect for today's youths, since they are too busy being indoctrinated in school. But I digress...The scope and breath of this film is amazing. The fact that the film stays together after so much detail is amazing in itself. I read many of the user comments and tend to agree that a lot of the dialogue is stilted, especially in the American scenes. The best part of the film for me was the scenes involving the Germans. Their acting was years ahead of its time. I love the scenes where the German officers are afraid to wake Hitler to tell him about the invasion. The only French scene I can stomach is at the beginning when Irina Demick is on the bike trying to distract the Germans from the adjacent wagon of hay, in where her comrades were hidden. Holy crap she was hot!I thought the best American performances were from Robert Mitchum, Richard Beymer and Henry Fonda, whose role was unfortunately too brief. The best British performance was from Richard Burton. His scene at the end is great.Although nothing can match the Normandy landing in ""Saving Private Ryan"", I'd take this version of D-Day anyday. While people have commented about the armchair warhawks like John Wayne, I similarly find the inclusion of Matt Damon and other Hollywood lefties in SPR just as revolting.",9.0,Anonymous,History
All time best movie about  WWll,Probably the best movie of all about the second world war. I've seen this movie many times and I think it should be required viewing in all high schools. War is hell they say. That morning when the men of the free world landed on the beaches of Normandy shall never be forgotten. One can only imagine what it was like for those men in the landing craft when the ramps came down and they went forward to begin the liberation of Europe. This movie comes close to the experience. Although quite graphic in it's portrayal of the carnage there is no time to shed a tear for each man as you see him fall because this movie is fast paced. Many died that day and some never left that beach. Thousands are buried on the bluffs above in carefully manicured lawns of the military cemeteries. See this movie with your children so none will ever forget the sacrifice ordinary Americans made to free Europe.,10.0,Anonymous,History
I would like to nominate this as one of the worst movies ever made,"It is clear that the filmmakers were ONLY interested in packing as many movie stars (large and small) into the movie, rather than actually MAKING a movie.so they could put their names on the marquee. The problem with that approach is the the movie watcher becomes distracted by wondering which star will suddenly appear on the screen for no apparent reason.

WWII Epic told from all sides of the Great War,"With the recent release of the WWII epic ""Saving Private Ryan"" garnering attention as ""one of the great war movies of all time"", it should be noted that this lavish 1962 production can more than hold it's own.  A true epic, this film combines spectacular battle scenes (even by today's standards) with a superb cast of over 48 international stars.To me, what sets this film apart from Ryan is the way all sides of the conflict are brought to the screen with such superb acting.  John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, and many, many others guide us gracefully through the events of the D-day invasion.  The film captures the historical element of the event, while still offering an exciting and entertaining action-adventure to boot.  For war-movie buffs, this is a film that should not be missed.  And for those who feel that Private Ryan is indeed the ""best war film of our time"", you should give this epic film another look.",,Anonymous,History
A great film portraying a true story of human suffering beyond our imagination.,The first film that I have seen with an all international cast.Having watched hundreds of films with those same actors it was refreshing to see them all come together in such a tremendous story. I get the video out every ANZAC day to remind me that the people they portrayed must have gone through hell to bring some normality back to the world. It was also good to see both sides of the story. John Wayne was one of my heroes and to see him in a military roll after seeing him in so many westerns took a bit of getting used to. Also Eddie Albert(Green Acres) was interesting in a military role. The story portrayed made me realize that we are fortunate to have had such brave men and woman who were prepared to die for our freedom and sadly today I doubt if we would find the same commitment in New Zealand.,10.0,Anonymous,History
The Longest Movie Worth Seeing,"This war epic is a marvel of keeping the story line going with so many sub-plots.

"Revisiting June 6, 1944","There are just some dates in history that will live forever. July 20, 1969 was one of those days, when Man set foot on the Moon for the first time. November 22, 1963 was another such day, when America lost its innocence as the result of John F. Kennedy being murdered.Another important date in world history would be June 6, 1944. On that day, with the world still writhing in pain from a horrible war, an invasion force of three million soldiers from the U.S., England, and Canada stormed the beaches of France's Normandy coastline to start the freeing of Europe from Adolf Hitler's Nazi tyranny, which by that time had killed well over fifteen million people overall (six million of those for the specific reason of them being Jewish). The operation was known as ""Operation Overlord""; and the date itself became known as D-Day. But for those millions who stormed those beaches, and the tens of thousands of them who were to lose their lives in this great cause, it was THE LONGEST DAY. And eighteen years later, in 1962, the combined talents of 20th Century Fox mogul Darryl Zanuck, writer Cornelius Ryan, and tons of others memorialized that day on the big screen in one of the greatest Hollywood epics ever made.This nearly three-hour masterpiece doesn't just focus on the complexities of the D-Day landing itself; it also gives us a look at the men who had to fight it, and the Nazi commandants who were in charge of repelling the invasion (and who evidently slept at the switch, not thinking that such an invasion could ever be mounted). THE LONGEST DAY was the most expensive black-and-white movie ever made in Hollywood up to that point, at nearly $10 million; and in order to make this happen, Zanuck got practically every living actor in Hollywood, and some more from England, to participate. This meant that many of the actors were only on the screen for a short time; and it also meant that some were in roles that they arguably were a bit too old to be playing. Still, the presence of these actors and their star wattage made THE LONGEST DAY, among other things, The Biggest Deal. When you have a cast that includes John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Rod Steiger, Robert Ryan, Edmond O'Brien, Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, and Eddie Albert just for starters, then it definitely is a big deal.Of course, it is tempting for people to compare this film's depiction of the D-Day landing to the way it was depicted in, but was the opening salvo to, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. But such comparisons, while inevitable, are not necessarily fair or accurate. What was shown in unflinchingly graphic detail by Steven Spielberg in his 1998 masterpiece could not be shown in pre-MPAA ratings Hollywood. One can't hold this against either Zanuck, or the three directors (Andrew Marton; Ken Annakin; Bernhard Wicki) who helped bring THE LONGEST DAY to the screen. In the end, THE LONGEST DAY still gives one a feel of the scope of the way the invasion took place, and some of the foibles that occurred on and prior to June 6, 1944. The fact is that D-Day, while an enormous success for the Allies in the end, wasn't perfect at its inception, which was certainly shown to be so in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and acknowledged here.Still, the invasion was given its full measure of due here in THE LONGEST DAY; and that's why it remains indisputably one of the greatest films about the absolute last ""Good War"" in history.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Aviation contents not really correct,"Great epic movie. However, aviation related aspects not really perfect as it would be possible in 1962. During the operation, the most utilized airplane for paratroopers and glider towing duties was the ubiquitous Douglas C-47 (available perhaps in great number in the sixties and still flying nowadays). No C-47 are visible in the movie (!). The planes in the movie are only Avro Lancasters (only models) that were not utilized for the Sealord operations except for bombing ops. The towing was performed by HP Halifaxes and Short Stirlings, plus said C-47 and Curtiss C-46 from USAAF. The Luftwaffe Priller's planes were actually Focke Wulf 190 while in the film they are badly represented by Messerchmitt 108 (in their post war french version by Nord Aviation), a light communication and trainer airplane and not really a fighter . Its resemblance to the illustrious Me 109 fighter could be the reason of the choice. Look at the Priller's airplane control column: too long , the fighter cloche works between pilot's legs. During the beaching ops there are American fighters flying low over the ships. They are Douglas Skyraiders , a plane that did not participate to the II WW but become a standard attack plane during Korea and the, Vietnam too. Quite right the Airspeed Horsa glider mock-ups and models bit with wrong English Insignia over the wings. No American gliders are visible, like the largely utilized Waco Hadrians in their classic olive drab camouflage and invasion black and white identification stripes.

The Way a Story Should be Told,"What does Titanic, Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbour have in common and why, you may ask yourself, what do they have to do with a review for The Longest Day.Well bare with me and all will be revealed. They answer to the above question is they are all good films that could have been great films, if they had stuck to an age old formula, which is 'if there is a great tale already, then do not invent a sub story', for example Titanic, great effects, great acting, bad love story. A Night to Remember, fantastic acting, but out of date effects and a little out of date on facts but told the tale quite true to the facts as they where known then. Mix both films together (removing the fictitious love story) and what do you get. A film that would be a classic.And the same could be said for The Longest Day and Saving Private Ryan (or Pearl Harbour) The Longest Day is in my opinion is one the greatest war stories ever put to film.It builds the story up well and tells the tale from the Allies (yes the Allies, sorry to tell you this America, but you did not win World War II on your own) and the German's point of view. It has an almost endless list of star's (albeit some in cameo's) and is well directed.If you have never seen this film or have not seen it for a while and you have a spare couple of hours, would like to be entertained, but also educated at the same time then this is the film for you. Ideal for a winter Sunday afternoon, just after the roast beef and yorkshire pud.

There have been some great war movies... but in generally I find them all the same. Unfortunately, this one didn't really stand out for me. I was bored through some of it. It just felt like another old war movie. I know it did well when it first came out... it was nominated for 5 Oscars I believe.The acting was good by everyone... there is a very impressive cast list for this movie.

Richard Burton, Sean Connery, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Roddy McDowall, Leslie Phillips, George Segal, Rod Steiger & Robert Wagner. Very impressive.The actual fighting scenes were pretty good, but being a war movie, that was pretty much it. There were a few parts of the movie that I thought were great... I loved the idea of them dropping little fake soldiers out of planes just to distract the Germans so they could attack from behind. There were also other parts that I really liked.The film is on for so long too... the movie goes on for 3 hours, and it definitely felt like it.I will give this film 4 out of 10.I do understand why this is a classic, but it is not for me i'm afraid.

Just one little thing.,"I submitted that to the Trivia line but it seems that it did not make it. In the sequence of the sea side bunker attack, at the Pointe du Hoc, after the Kieffer Command men succeeded in their mission, we see them kill in cold blood German soldiers who wanted to surrender. We see more or less the same scene in Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and series BAND OF BROTHERS. But if you have read the book document about the D Day viewed from the German side THEY COME,written by the German Paul Carrell, a former Nazi general - who later wrote under an aka - and who always emphasized on the legendary chivalry and German courage, he never spoke of this fact, Allies killing German soldiers who wanted to surrender; killed them in cold blood. Strange, isn'it?
And I think it would need a remake, because the book written by Cornelius Ryan is one thousand times more interesting than the however excellent film, the feature that re invent the war movie, brought it to a higher scale. In the book, you have millions of details, awesome details and elements which could not be put in the movie. Details about German soldiers, US privates aboard the landing barges, puking, crying, dying even before arriving on Omaha Beach. A new movie or even a TV series, some kind of spin-off of BAND OF BROTHERS, but focusing on D DAY only. That's a suggestion.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Big Shots Useless,"It appears that I have a different opinion about this movie, many people seem to love it associating/rating the movie with the real event. My father was there, and he was taken out of WWII when an artillery shell injured him after two weeks of fighting; but went back to Korea and Vietnam. My mother (French National) worked for the US Army Corps of Engineers during and after the war. So my respect for the bravery and sacrifices of the men/women is very high.The film does a nice job in documenting part of important history. However, the use of the big shot actors was completely overdone. John Wayne was terrible, simply playing his same role, but carrying a .45 M1911 instead of a .45 Colt (or .44-40). He uses his (presumably loaded) M1 Garand as a crutch, the muzzle, of course, pointed at himself. Great idea. Richard Burton's acting was terrible, so was Eddie Albert's, Peter Lawford's, and Henry Fonda's. The un/known actors of less status did a far better job. It is as if big actors were just included, regardless of logic and acting ability, to be included in the movie, just to get the audience, with their long patriotic speeches.Reading one person's comments, the role of the Canadians was omitted from the movie, they were on Juno. Also, s/he made a notable mention of the venerable M1 Garand, designed by a Canadian.However, take away the over-paid/over-acting actors, and there is a solid movie.

One of the best W.W.2 movies,"This movie features some of the best and detailed battle scenes of all war movies.It shows d-day in a realistic way. Unlike other war movies from that time it does not picture the Germans as a bunch of evil mongoloids who just happened to have conquered almost the entire world. It simply shows the essential tactical mistakes the Germans made on D-day.""The Longest Day"" also gives you a good impression of the courage it took for the 'all or nothing' invasion the allied forces made. Especially the scenes where the paratroopers are being dropped behind enemy lines makes you wonder how one would feel in such a dangerous situation. The troopers were sometimes dropped right into enemy garrisons or killed by small arms fire before they even touched ground.One bad thing about the movie is that it contains a couple of scenes that were supposed to illustrate the madness of war in a  funny/sarcastic way. Could've been a good idea if it hadn't been done so damn corny. I really could've done without that happy French resistance guy with the silver helmet or the joking 'Tommy' at the beach( Sean Connery.)

Based on the book by Cornelius Ryan I  found it to be true in most details but wish it would have shown how the U.S. Navy Destroyer came in close to the shore to help silence some of the German artillery with its big guns and the fact that German Panzer tanks were waiting behind the beaches with their motors running ,waiting to get orders from Hitler to engage the Allied forces ,but it never came because Hitler was asleep in Berlin and his people were afraid to wake him because he was prone to make bad decisions and he was convinced the REAL invasion would come farther north in France and closer to England. Overall the film was a fine one and makes me proud of American military in time of war and sad that so many men died to keep us free.",,Anonymous,History
A white elephant on Normandy beaches.,"""The Longest Day"" I assume will be viewed by some to mark the 79th anniversary of the day, June 7th, 1944, ""D Day"". Made 61 years ago it has aged badly. Cinema had featured D-Day before and after with better success. 'Hollywood' wanted to catch the success of Cornelius Ryan's book of a similar name. They pumped it up with dozens of stars, terribly cliched writing by Cornelius Ryan with help from professional screenwriters who got a fat payday out of it. They depended on sound and fury and very little on acting. The actors short scenes were shot all over the planet then spliced into some slapdash order as the final product. There is little or no energy between actors when it is done this way. The only actor who seemed to catch the energy of D-Day was John Wayne who by this time had done dozens of war movies. This is a failed effort to film the catastrophic energy of D-day.",4.0,Anonymous,History
The best WWII movie ever made,"The Longest Day has all of the elements of a great war movie. First is authenicity. In other words, the German speak german, The French speak french and so on. Second, it was historically accurate and third it provided a great balance of the dread of war vs. the solider's attempt at maintaining a sense of humor in the face of death.This is my favorite war movie. I can watch it day after day for three billion times. I never grow tired of it.",,Anonymous,History
Airborne operations not accurate,"My father made the D-Day jump with the 82nd airborne. He watched the airborne portions in stunned silence. In this movie, there was no anti-aircraft fire, and Sainte-Mère-Église and the surrounding area were shown as totally pacified after the night drop. In fact, the battle in that region raged for another month. Also, if I recall correctly, General Gavin was never shown in France in the movie. Three days after the drop, he lead ""one of the most intense small-unit engagements in all of WWII and Korea"" at the La Fière causeway. If you want to see an accurate depiction of the drop, see Band of Brothers.",4.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best,"I never get tired of seeing this movie.  Although it was made the year of my birth (1962)and 18 years after the actual event, it tells the story as it happened.  The invasion of Normandy, as most people know, turned the tide of the war against the Germans, but some people today can't even tell you the date of the invasion.  This movie was made by people who not only remember the events, some like Eddie Albert, were actually serving in the military during WWII.  Because of this fact, this is one movie that does not need to be remade.  The true meaning just can't be brought forward by the actors of today, no matter how talented.",,Anonymous,History
Obsolete,"Any war movie with John Wayne isn't worth your time, even The Sands of Iwo Jima.  He is no better here as the gung-ho airborne commander.  I don't see what the Zanuck's saw in him other than box office exploitation.The other day I sat down and made a list of all the war movies I'd seen, many of the embarrassing ones of my youth cropped up along the way and then I remembered The Longest Day.  So, in an attempt to clear my conscience, I rented it and became sorely UN-impressed.  The Longest Day has no credibility.  It is too concerned with ""Kraut-bashing"" to be of any historical value and even the French are poorly represented.  It wants to be a happy-sappy excursion in futile heroics and false patriotism.  What a load of...Many scenes have aged worse than your grandmother.  What might have worked in 1962 doesn't work today.  And people thought John Hughes was bad...The depiction of war here is in the same vein as other garbage from the 50s and 60s, gung-ho and inconsequential.  Patton and Platoon, among others, covered these grounds--sometimes more preachy than in other instances.Overall, a poor excuse for a war movie.  While Saving Private Ryan is a load of patriotic hooey, at least it was concerned about people and not events. For a better understanding, watch Tora! Tora! Tora!  1 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,History
The most over-rated movie ever made,"There is too much good stuff in The Longest Day for it to be called totally worthless, but it's certainly less good than you'd think, given its credentials. The film was an incredibly epic production, probably right up there with Lawrence of Arabia for sheer number of extras, number of costumes, number of locations, etc. This may actually be the films problem: it's too big to hold together, and collapses under its own weight.The film touted itself as having a cast of ""48 international stars."" I don't think its being timid to say that's too many. It obviously lets out much by way of character development, and even makes it hard to keep track of who's who. The audience is expected to keep track of dozens of subtitles telling characters' names and affiliations. This is mitigated somewhat by the star system, however that brings up another problem -- no single player is able to get enough screen time to really capture our attention. John Wayne swaggers forth for what looks like it could have been one of the best movies of his career, and then never really gets to do anything.And really, the script is just plain bad. A lot of the dialogue sounds bizarrely amateurish, and more than a few situations are so badly conceived its more like a comedy than a ""war epic."" Big dramatic moments are written in that never come to anything, and supposedly big moments are shoehorned in when there's been nothing to remotely build up to them. Any kind of tension or coherent pacing are nowhere to be seen, and this is worsened by the fact that the film is criminally over-long. It could have ended over an hour before it does, and when it finally does end, it would be hard to imagine a more arbitrary moment for it.One can probably tell a lot from the fact that the film had three directors, nearly a dozen screenwriters, and an army of consultants. With so many voices clamouring at once, its no surprise the film takes the vague, rambling shape it does, with no single, coherent voice shining through.And the combat. Oh, the combat. Imagine if you will the fantasies of a six-year old with only the vaguest idea of what a war consists of. Now imagine that same six-year old given a Hollywood epic budget to put his fantasies on screen. That's what a lot of the film's fighting looks like. We're spoiled for realism in this age of Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down, where We Were Soldiers is the worst it gets. The Longest Day is the product of another age, where it was thought necessary to romanticize war and lionize the soldiers in it. When it was an odious task to have to show a single GI get killed, and would be made up for by showing 50 Germans with machine guns get gunned down by one GI with a rifle and a few grenades (which in this movie, seem mysteriously to be nothing more than smoke grenades).The only redeeming moments in this movie come from the odd moment when one of its stars gets enough screen time to say something memorable, or the odd cleverly scripted moment. Big, grandiose aerial shots of battle mean little when they're in no coherent context, and it doesn't help that they're interspersed with gratuitously slapstick humour. This movie is not even worth wasting a coupon on.",,Anonymous,History
The definitive D-Day film.,"If you want an all-round, (relatively) unbiased overview of the D-Day landings, then this is the film to watch. Reasonably accurate, historically, with some good acting performances from some big screen names. It is somewhat sanitised, with regards to the battle scenes, although this is hardly surprising, given the year it was made. If you get the chance, read the book of the same name, by Cornelius Ryan, to see just how accurate this film is, you may be slightly surprised. All in all, an excellent film, even now, nearly 40 years later.On a slightly different note. I was under the impression that this film, when made, was the most expensive black & white film ever made. Well, they made a colour version of it too. A fact I was totally unaware of, until I saw it on TV this afternoon. I even had to get my old, taped, copy of the film, to check. Every time I've seen this film, it's been in black & white, and all this time, a colour version was available.",,Anonymous,History
Better than SAVING PRIVATE RYAN!!,"Yes, you read that RIGHT.  My Dad was in WW2. This is WAY better than SPR. Why?  Because it focus's on OPERATION OVERLORD and the D DAY INVASION.  A lot of planning went into D DAY and SPR failed to show that.  I loved SPR, don't get me wrong, but it's not the kind of movie you show in HISTORY CLASS.  This movie showed SWORD BEACH, UTAH BEACH and even a scene with IKE!!  The man who played Dwight D. Eishenhower looked EXACTLY like him. John Wayne played a GENERAL in this movie and was great as a TOUGH MAN who REFUSED to quit.  He didn't even have the lead role.  There was a lot of death in this movie. The beach smelled of death!  The man played by Sean Connery was very lowkey and had perhaps a couple of lines.  Robert Mitchum was great!  In one scene he made one of his men go back to the beach to grab his rifle!!  I WILL NEVER FORGET THOSE BRAVE SOULS WHO SACRAFICED THEIR LIVES FOR OUR COUNTRY!!!!  This is one movie I will watch OVER AND OVER!!!!!!!!!",,Anonymous,History
very good Normandy film,"This old movie about the Normandy invasion was made only a few year after the end of WWII.  I saw it in class the other day, and I was pleasently surprised.  Yes the acting is overdone.  This is especially true of John Wayne.  I can not understand how that man ever got big screen rolls.  He is just NOT a good actor.  I did however like the acting of some of the characters.  The German actors were cool (the talk about the dummies was FUNNY).Just to let you know, this movie was filmed ON LOCATION on the actual Normandy beaches and the towns in the area.  Most of the scenes on beaches actually DID happen (although of course they were played up by the actors).I really don't know where I would rate this in terms of war movies.  I REALLY like Saving Private Ryan (even after the landing scene).  And, I am a big fan of Glory.  It is certainly one of the best war movies I have seen though.",,Anonymous,History
Impressive and ambitious epic that is of it's time,"The Longest Day could never be made today. Only the studio system, in it's last gasps by the production date of this film, could afford to put so many A-List stars into a film for, in many cases, fleeting cameos.Many of the criticisms levied at the film are merely reflections of the prevailing attitude to such a project in the sixties. WWII was still a vivid memory to many of the makers (Richard Todd virtually plays himself in this film) and understandably they submit to the temptation of making their comrades a little more consciously heroic than they were. This after all is designed to be an entertainment - not a documentary. Nevertheless there is a more even handed treatment of the material than you might expect, the victory is shown as being as much due to German errors as to Allied successes and the acknowledgement of the parts played by the Free French and resistance groups seems more enlightened than modern Hollywood often manages. Three pieces of tour-de-force camera work stick out vividly - a small group of GI's playing craps is revealed, through a spectacular zoom out and tracking shot to be a vast dormitory of soldiers awaiting the word to go. Two Luftwaffe fighters strafe the beaches and we see every bit of WWII hardware the production could lay hands on as we see the attack run from the fighters POV. Finally the opening of the assault on a German garrison filmed as another single tracking shot that must have taken whole days to re-set between takes.Dated yes but still a significant piece of cinema and a fitting tribute to the Men and Women who lost their lives in June 1944.",,Anonymous,History
The Best,I bought this movie in widescreen and sat through the drama at the beginning and found it boring.  And then I got hit head on with action and more action and even more action!

Over the top movie straight into the gutter of history,"This is quite a poor movie on many fronts, although it does succeed in combining an impressive cast and some large battle scenes. The story is unfortunately populated by cartoon characters. Some of them are so hideous e.g. french farmer celebrating shelling of the beach right by his house, that I just hoped the writers would have had the mercy to kill them quickly. Unfortunately, they did not. The acting is wooden (yes, John Wayne is here), and the actors are given some howler lines to deliver. The battle scenes, although using an impressive number of extras and equipment, fail to deliver on the realism side; the cliff climbing scene is just plain silly. The beach landing is very similar to that in Saving Private Ryan, however the pace is slower, with a smaller body count. Overall, although no doubt an achievement for it's time this film has aged badly. It's story is definitely more interesting and relevant than that in SPR, however the screenplay and acting are poor. Watch it if you have nothing else to do for 3 hrs or want some laughs.",,Anonymous,History
A D-Day Disappointment,"I was somewhat disapointed after seeing this war movie, but the reason behind that is probably because I saw Saving private Ryan before watching this. Saving Private Ryan leaves quite am impression on you, and other D-Day movies, including this one, have a hard time living up to Saving Private Ryan.A main reason that this movie is so weak is because of it's unrealistic portrayal of D-Day. The film tries to show D-Day as a group of brave American and British men, at peace with God, and ready to fight and die for their country, no matter what the cost, these men were ready to go into battle. This is made obviously clear as John Wayne runs out of his invasion boat courageously at the German bunkers onto the beaches of Normandy, his men following bravely behind him, not once hesitating to find a large obstacle to hide behind. When in fact, the young men who fought at Normandy were scared beyond reality. The invasion boats were covered in puke because the men were so frightened that they were throwing up. Men lost their values, beliefs, and standards for human life in D-Day and the rest of the war. This film tries to portray it as exciting, to make everyone get up, join the Army, and go kill the Nazi's, or whatever enemy America may be fighting now.Which brings up another point that this film is purely American propaganda, trying to support the Army. The reason that this film is so weak and unreal, is most likely due to the fact of the cencorship of the 60's time period. They weren't allowed to show the true brutality of war, and the fact is, they probably couldn't have captured it then anyway.While I did enjoy the film because it is about D-Day and is a good movie, especially for it's time, it makes war look like fun, which simply isn't true. However, I reccommend you see this movie anyway, because it is still quite interesting.",,Anonymous,History
above average old-school WWII epic,"For all the star power money could buy, you get a good value if you see ""The Longest Day"".  As far as old-fashioned Hollywood epics go, it's not bad--One thing, though, the Omaha Beach landing scene aged about sixty years the very day ""Saving Private Ryan"" was released.  Guess that's the price of progress.",,Anonymous,History

Not to be seen as Historical,"In respects to the previous comment of ""The Longest Day"" being obsolete...I am no big fan of war movies myself, however my family is a big fan of John ""The Duke"" Wayne, and it must be remembered that he was an icon of American patriotism, despite how bad the movie might be.Also ""The Longest Day"" isn't meant to be an ACCURATE account of the historical event....What movie is an accurate account of a historical event??? It was nothing more than a tribute to the men who dedicated and sacrificed their lives for our freedom and who bravely fought in the Second World War, particularly the invasion of Normandy. The movie was made at a time of national competition and political unrest, particularly with the threat of communism, and it must be remembered that the main purpose of ""The Longest Day"" and other war movies where the American's are seen as the absolute heroes, is propaganda; to promote American patriotism, to emphasize the values of a democratic society and to boost morale.Please do not judge ""The Longest Day"" as being inaccurate, for it's purpose is also to entertain people...not teach them per se.",,Anonymous,History
Best Thing about TLD,"Like Tora! Tora! Tora! it shows the war from different perspectives. You get to see it from the point of view of the Allies, including the British and the French resistance and the Germans. This makes it the single greatest WW 2 film ever made. And that is why Saving Ryan's Privates, the Thin Red Line etc. etc. have not outdone it. Simply because they insist on trying to convince the viewer that the USA won the war all by itself and by creating fictional plots rather than dealing with historical facts.",,Anonymous,History
Great Movie But Dated,"Everyone else seems to think that this is the best war movie ever made (or close to it), including several friends whose opinion I value.  However, although I agree that it is one of the best war films of its time, I feel that it has not aged well and is now dated & not as interesting as more recent efforts.My biggest problem is the depiction of the Germans vs. the Allied characters.  The Allies tend to be shown in a silly or comical way--snapping their little plastic noise makers, cracking jokes, & engaging in other low comedy (i.e. Sean Connery).  Meanwhile, the Germans are all depicted as deadly serious, realistic characters.  One gets the feeling that the tension in the film comes from whether these bumbling comedians can overcome the serious, goal-driven Germans.  While the film is faithful to Ryan's book, the choices of what to show and how to show it are not well made.  This may not have been that big a problem in 1962, but in 1999 it is a significant one.A further problem is with the idea of the ""all-star"" cast.  The stars tend to overcome the characters they're supposed to be playing.  Again, other than the German characters who are given more depth, there is a tendency to toss big names at the audience and the significance of the character they're playing is minimized.I'm not saying this is a bad movie (no movie with Robert Ryan in it can be said to be truly bad).  What I am saying is that it has lost some of its sheen over the years.  I have to admit to preferring ""A Bridge Too Far"" when it comes to ""all-star war movies"".  For all the flaws in that film, it puts its actors firmly into character and doesn't fall for simplistic sentimentality.  And the low humor is kept to a minimum.",,Anonymous,History
