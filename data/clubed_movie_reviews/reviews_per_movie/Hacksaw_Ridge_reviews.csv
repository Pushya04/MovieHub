At The Very Center Of It All,"We knew already that Mel Gibson is a filmmaker with a powerful vision and the craftsmanship to go with it. Extraordinary battle scenes. Violence, Gibson style, which means Peckinpah plus, because here there is such a personal intention that makes every frame, utterly compelling. The only drawback and I have to say it, Vince Vaughn. Why? In the moment he appears, this extraordinary film becomes a movie. It took me completely out of it. When you look at him you see an actor, acting. On the other hand, Andrew Garfield. Sublime. He makes totally believable a character that could be fictional. The humanity in Andrew Garfield's eyes makes everything real. It tells us, in no uncertain terms, that at the very center of it all, there is love. Love!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Back on the battlefield with Mel...,"I was lucky enough to sneak into a cast & crew screening at the Newtown Dendy cinema. I thought 10.30AM on a Sunday was too early for a Mel Gibson movie, that I might be in for something along the lines of the heavy-handedness of THE PASSION OF THE Christ, and the adrenaline pumped brilliance of APOCALYPTO.I was proved wrong because after the first thirty minutes I wasn't sure if this was a Mel Gibson film when I was placed into a comfort zone, with its melodrama set in a small Virginia town during the Forties, a schmaltzy romance, and the cliché violent drunken father who survived a brutal war. The performances were maybe a little let down by the clumsy dialogue, but all directed safely with a natural sense of storytelling.By the 2nd act, I was put on high alert in the military training with our protagonist, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield who I at first felt was wrongly cast, but he really came through in the end). It was here when the true purpose of the story began to evolve, that of Doss' moral and internal conflict with using a gun! What he had to endure and stand-up for was a courage I greatly admired. It was also in this phase of the film that the dialogue and characters began to shine. Maybe it was the introduction of Vince Vaughn's character. We all know how Vaughn is notorious in ad-libbing, and it seemed to help because the other actors bounced off it well.Now the story had me in their pocket because by the 3rd act I was with our protagonist and his platoon when they got to the battlefield graveyard of Hacksaw Ridge. You thought the horrific situation in WE WERE SOLDIERS was brutal, well this was captured so vividly that you felt you were there. It was almost on par with the brilliance of GAME OF THRONES; BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS.Now I felt I was in a Mel Gibson film. As with Braveheart, the battle scenes in Hacksaw Ridge didn't hold back. Maybe a notch better because of today's CGI (and I didn't even notice the effects!). The scenes were unflinching, haunting and in your face. Possibly showing you the true horror of war. Definitely not for the squeamish.The religious aspect of the film was relevant to the story, so as a non-believer I thought it was an integral part of the protagonist and had to be told, so it didn't bother me as much.Overall the technical aspect of the film was brilliant, but then again I didn't really notice it because I was too distracted by the story and the characters, and when that occurs, I know the film has succeeded.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Welcome back Mr Gibson,"When thinking about war films, it's very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.Some war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story, all three of the above for example however, a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story, especially one as remarkable as the story that Hacksaw Ridge is based on.Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) became the first Conscientious Objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honour even though he refused to kill or even carry a rifle while serving as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Doss' phenomenal story of courage saw him single-handedly save the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire.Hacksaw Ridge is very much a film of two halves; the first introducing us to Doss, exploring both his personal life and his motivations for choosing to become a Conscientious Objector and serve as a medic, the second depicting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the site of one of the bravest human feats in history. Both tell the story of the determined individual that Doss was and Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film.Gibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director, and in Hacksaw Ridge, he may just have made his best film yet. It's the emotional power of the story that Gibson taps into so successfully that makes Hacksaw Ridge such compelling viewing, whether it be Doss' arduous journey through combat training or the visceral war sequences. I was an emotional wreck as the credits started to roll.Speaking of war sequences, Hacksaw Ridge possesses some of the most brutal and harrowing you'll ever see, reminiscent of the opening to Saving Private Ryan. Due to the fact that Doss served as a medic, there are parts where a strong stomach is needed as he obviously has to tend to a number of seriously wounded soldiers. The relentlessness of the sequences is admirable from Gibson and they're wonderfully shot by Simon Duggan.Coming to the performances, Hacksaw Ridge features an amazing lead performance from Andrew Garfield, who wanted to move away from his days as Spider-Man with a chance to play such an inspiring real life hero. I thought Garfield was always one of the best things about the Amazing Spider-Man films but it's great to see him really grow as an actor. His performance as Doss is one of the best of the year and I would love to see him get some form of recognition come awards season.The supporting cast threw me a little but they all play their part in excelling the film, expected from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer but the film surprised me with how good some of the cast were. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn, who I never thought I'd see play a part in a war film, particularly that of an Army Sergeant.Few films this year have hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and that's why I have to say it's a most welcome return to filmmaking from Mel Gibson. It's right up there as one of the best films of the year and definitely one to see on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Saviour Private Doss,"Just watched this movie at the pre-screening and feel like I owe it to the creators to write a review. Having read other reviews, it is hard to stay original, so first are few thoughts that I shared with the others. Great to have Mel Gibson back in the directors seat. I will be surprised if we don't see this film in a few Oscars categories. Now, few thoughts of my own. The movie depicts brutality of war in gory details, so much so, that I had to turn my eyes away from screen couple of times. However, I do understand why this was important to the story line. It was done so that we could truly appreciate Doss's act of bravery, feel it like we were there and witnessed it firsthand - nothing was left out. The story grabs you from beginning and does not let you off until very end - after the movie I turned back and half of the girls in the theater were still wiping tears. Bottom line - instant classic that will find it's place on the shelf next to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Hacksaw Ridge: an emotional journey alongside the war-hero, Desmond Doss.","Hacksaw Ridge is not a film for the feint-hearted. Right away the opening scenes portray the horror of war, and the emotional journey is only beginning as the audience is led through the story of war-hero Desmond Doss. One of the great feats of storytelling from Mel Gibson (director) and Andrew Garfield (leading role, Desmond Doss) is to lead the audience along Doss' journey with a feeling of having experienced the journey as Doss, and experiencing the wide range of emotions endured by this heroic character along his journey.Neither war itself nor violence are glorified in the film, yet they also not derided. The elements of conflict that draw the storyteller – the heroism of overcoming adversity, the bonding of soldiers, and the brave resolve on which soldiers must rely to perform their duty amidst such chaos and terror – these elements are all present, but they placed alongside the horror, the madness and the terror of war, and used to draw in the audience for Doss' journey. The lasting psychological impact for those who survive conflict is well told by Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Doss' father, whose lines could serve as a mouthpiece for many veterans.The supporting roles add depth, with both script and performance making very few, if any, of the supporting characters two dimensional. Vince Vaughn's excellent turn as Doss' training sergeant provides both humour and pathos to bring laughs and pause- for-thought at well scripted points of the tale, allowing the audience to gather their breath.By the end of the film, audience members will leave the cinema feeling tired, worn out by having experienced Doss' journey of hope, innocence, love, confusion, anger, faith, and courage. Hacksaw Ridge is in no way a popcorn-lazy-Sunday-afternoon film; it is a journey.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The best battle scene ever,"One word, legend. It was the movie with the best battle scenes I've watched so far. I have never watched another battle scene so realistic, so vibrant, so vibrant for so many people. Er Ryan has a famous landing stage. There's a better battle scene than him.At first I have to say. The movie looks a bit like Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Especially in terms of first and second half. The first part is not a severe psychology like FMJ. But it is similar in structure. It's more emotional and funny in places. But from the moment the second episode began, I was buried in the seat. I almost fell into the war.A silence and a bullet. Here you hear the voice of the buzzer. After that, doomsday. The bullet is passing by the head. Human flesh is flying over. The man's brains are bursting. A few feet away the man has no legs. Bombs are flying in the back. That's what he was. A bullet. Nobody has any idea what's going on. Only the flying bullets, the blood and the rest of the human remains. I can go back to the cinema for that episode so I say. Just for that episode. And also whoever did the vocalization, give it to the man Oscar. Speaking is perfect in the real sense.I guess the best of war movies in terms of visual and sound. There are other things missing, but get it. Acting is not very good overall. But in the father role, I love Hugo Weaving. The film has a little Forrest Gump, a little Saving Private Ryan, a little Full Metal Jacket and a little Paths of Glory. He's got something all the time. But in essence it's a movie of its own. Watch, watch. Good looking ...",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Enjoyable, but almost two different movies","Hacksaw Ridge was a very enjoyable (based on) true story, but almost two different movies. The first half focused of family and love and the second half was a bloody war scene depicting true bravery by a determined idealist. I would recommend seeing it on the big screen for the sound and cinematography. It received nominations for Best Drama Picture, Best Actor in Drama and Director.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mel Gibson's near-triumphant come-back,"Not one of my favourite war films, like 1930's 'All Quiet on the Western Front', 'Paths of Glory', 'The Thin Red Line' and 'Apocalypse Now', but exceptionally well made and incredibly powerful.It has been said about 'Hacksaw Ridge' that the second half is better than the first half, something that is agreed with by me. Not that the family/character study stuff is bad, far from it, it's beautifully filmed, even better acted and paints Doss as a very fascinating character that it's easy from the get go to identify with his wants to succeed against all catastrophic odds.Just that the first third does take time to get going with a pedestrian pace, the dialogue is corny (in fact, to me the dialogue is the least good thing about 'Hacksaw Ridge' in general and the element that rings true the least) and the sentimentality is laid too thick (this is also particularly true in the slightly underdeveloped romance).However this is made up for by the entertaining yet hard-hitting training scenes and in particular the truly jaw-droppingly brutal war/battle scenes that soar in nerve-shredding intensity and raw emotion, giving the first 30 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' a run for its money and perhaps making it tame in comparison (high praise for a film with one of the most gut-wrenching first 30 minutes on film, though to me the rest of the film isn't quite as good).Throughout 'Hacksaw Ridge' has exceptional production values, in particular the cinematography in the battle scenes, and Gibson directs like his life was depending on it. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score has the right amount of pulsating energy and nuance, and the sound effects in the war/battle scenes have a terrifying authenticity.For a vast majority of the time, the story is very compelling and makes the most of mature and very easy to relate with themes. It has a wide range of emotional impact, being for the second half intensely powerful, much of the film being poignant, some of it sardonically amusing (without it being out of place) and also all of it inspirational. Rather than straying from the facts for dramatic license, Gibson is surprisingly respectful this time round.Andrew Garfield has yet to give a better performance than his astonishing turn here (though he is splendid too in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence'), and Gibson similarly brings the best out of Sam Worthington (often a charisma-free actor but here doubts were cast aside) and Vince Vaughn (at his sardonic best while also touchingly subdued, proof that he can be good if the material serves him all which too often in his career it hasn't but it does brilliantly here). Hugo Weaving is terrific, also giving some of his best work in some time. Teresa Palmer makes the most of her role.In conclusion, a near-triumphant come-back. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Superbly crafted screenplay of the Doc,"I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of HACKSAW RIDGE in Hollywood and was impressed. The screenplay is authentically-driven to the last detail and portrays the horrors (and prejudices) of wartime conduct. I knew we were watching an epic film when at the conclusion, the audience was stunned so much so that the applause was delayed.If you consider yourself a true patriot of America, this movie portrays YOUR values in a blessed light. For ONE gentlemen, amidst extremely adverse treatment by his own comrades and even more deadly hated by his enemy to have save SO many men... is simply epic.I watched the advanced screening with members of the military and faith community alike. At no time did anyone retract from the horrors of war or add asinine political commentary. We all understood that soldiers fight for one another before they fight for a cause and that hatred of war is universal; even among soldiers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"War films can be a bit hard to sit through, with its graphic depictions of key battles in history, strong themes of power, brotherhood and the effect it has among the world but with Mel Gibson's latest war drama 'Hacksaw Ridge' it manages to be something more that we can grasp it.The true life story of Desmond Doss is finally brought to the big screen, Doss was a US Army medic who served during WWII, but coming from a family with a strong religious beliefs and a father that struggled with the aftermath of WWI (a veteran himself) it lead him to be a Seventh-day Adventist, refusing to bare a firearm and the use of violence against another. His personal choice would affect his country's army and persuaded a court hearing to charge Doss for his personal beliefs and objection to bare arms but despite this, he is given the chance though to fight alongside his 'brothers' in the Battle of Okinawa, a battle which the American forces fought against the invading Japanese in an intense and brutal battle. It is here in this key battle that Doss was recognised as a true hero for his country, as he managed to rescue the lives of 75 soldiers wounded in battle.Gibson returns to the director's chair to helm this true story, giving his touch of humanistic quality, anti-war themes and brutality to the horrors of war to much great detail. The direction is pretty much on point throughout and never goes dull or loses itself during the 2 ½ running time. The first half of the film is about character and what establishes Doss to become a legend that he is known for, while the 2nd half of the film focuses on his role during the Battle of Okinawa and the brutal battle itself. The violence here is given so much detail, not holding back on the horrors of war and the devastating effect it carried on both sides. The production design, sound mixing, editing and scale of the battle is as intense, horrifying and respectful to the details and real life experiences to what we've read in history books, but it is yet filmed with beautiful and yet brutal detailing that echoes much to Saving Private Ryan's D-Day battle sequence. The 2nd half of the film is much darker than the first half and people will need a strong stomach to handle the graphic depictions of violence and deaths we see throughout, but it does get emotional at times and in the last few minutes of the film, though overall the film is emotional with Doss's back-story, his personal lifestyle and the brotherhood that Doss and his army experience and share on the battlefield.In terms of acting, the cast as a whole is incredible with Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey and Teresa Palmer giving the best key performances of the film. Garfield has come a long way to prove himself as a worthy actor, breaking away from his well known role as Spider-Man prior to HR. To describe his role as Doss, he gives a quality that defines him as a simple man with values in his life while facing a few struggles that form his belief of not bearing violence or firearms. Garfield must have given much study and preparation for the role, as his character's journey from a wise simple man to a hero of his army is given so much heart, emotion and bravery to make the journey of Doss so believable.Overall, Hacksaw Ridge is a film that will leave audiences in state of emotion that describes the horrors of war, the bravery of Doss and his army and a sense of thankfulness to our past ancestors who had lived in a time to fight for freedom and peace when the world was divided. An incredible film that will indeed earn its amount for Oscar nominations and wins in 2017 (possibly for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Production Design, Music Score, Sound Mixing & Editing and Script) alongside other film awards. A must see film if you have studied history at school, have an interest in history or if you love a solid war film that's true to its core. A masterpiece that will not be forgotten so quickly or never will, we both highly recommend it.5/5 Autistic Reviewers",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The 'using kind of religion'.,"I guess that Hacksaw Ridge could probably best be compared to the great Gary Cooper film Sergeant York which hewed pretty close to the truth about Alvin C. York, his background in Eastern Tennessee and his exploits in World War I.Like our protagonist Desmond Doss here, York had a rural background and joined a pacifist religious sect. Unlike Doss, York grew up as a hunter and was a dead shot. He wasn't sure what he would do if a combat situation arose. But he did what he did and got every decoration imaginable including the Congressional Medal Of Honor.Doss had a tougher row to hoe. He would not touch a weapon and the film will show you why. He felt it his patriotic duty to join, but as a combat medic, save lives rather than kill. With no weapon to defend his own person, this medic saved a lot of people at an engagement at a place dubbed Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa.In Sergeant York, Walter Brennan's country preacher character says that Gary Cooper has the 'using kind of religion'. That might well be said of Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss who got a Best Actor Oscar nomination as Doss. Cooper won one of his two Oscars for Sergeant York and Garfield really suggests his character in what he does with Doss.The battle scenes are suggestive of Saving Private Ryan, director Mel Gibson staged them well. Hacksaw Ridge did win a pair of Oscars for its Sound. Gibson got nominated for Best Director and the film itself for Best Picture.Hacksaw Ridge shows the horrors of war and from it the beauty of heroism when people have to summon their personal best and become more than themselves. The Doss story is one that deserves telling and retelling. Thanks to Mel Gibson it will be permanently retold.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Well done action v. Conviction,"The action was true to form as a Mel Gibson directed film. From the research I have done looks like a fairly accurate representation of what happened. The usual Hollywood exaggeration aside many true to life stories. There are a large number of 10 star ratings and a number of 1 star reviews. This always amazes me that you can have that disparity. Then I realized the10 star ratings were those who were truly moved by the movie.while the 1 star ratings were those that thought the movie should somehow be a documentary with real footage exclusively. One genius self proclaimed vet of multiple wars had a problem with the cargo net used to ascend the ridge being in his view as not at all plausible. Well turns out there are photos of the real Doss on the ridge with, wait for it,,,,, a cargo net, albeit not near as high as the movie cliff.This was a great movie for those of the Christian faith and a very good movie for those that like action and heroism in a war setting. The acting was very strong, directing, pace and back stories were also good. I try and use reviews and trailers to pick what I watch. It is becoming more difficult to do when you have reviewers that either had no clue what movie they were about to see or believe they somehow have their own story that is so much better.

Masterful Direction Makes for a Terrific War Film,"Hacksaw Ridge (2016)**** (out of 4)The incredible true story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), a simple man from Virginia who grows up with a strong religious nature, which means that he can not kill anyone. WWII breaks out and Doss believes it's his duty to sign up but he's soon butting heads with the people in his troop as he refuses to pick up a gun. They believe him to be a coward and can't understand his feelings but soon he's going to have to prove his worth during the battle of Okinawa.Mel Gibson's HACKSAW RIDGE is a story that probably would have been laughed off the page had it not been based on a true story. Obviously I'm not going to spoil the various plot points in the film but it's quite remarkable what this young man did. Not only the courage he showed but also the guts it took for him to stand up and do what he believed in. Gibson's direction is perfect and technically speaking there's not a single flaw to be found. There's no question that the film is one of the greatest war movies out there.What makes the film work so wonderfully well is that the drama off the battle field is just as intense as what is on the battle field once we get there. The battle scenes themselves are downright horrific and there about as tense as you're ever going to witness on a screen. Gibson's direction through these scenes was terrific and I must say that he managed to put some of the most graphic war scenes that you're ever going to witness. There's also a jump scare that happens towards the end, which has to be one of the greatest of any film I've seen. There's no question that you feel the horror that these men felt and it's just amazing that anyone could go through that and survive.Many people say SAVING PRIVATE RYAN has the greatest battle scenes and they're perfect but so are the ones here. What makes this film even greater for me is the fact that the story outside the battle is wonderful. I thought the training sequences were terrific and I thought the abuse that Doss goes through was terrific. Yes, we've seen this stuff in countless war movies but the story here is just so great and Gibson does such a wonderful job that you can't help but feel as if they're fresh and original. It also helps that the entire cast is so wonderful with Garfield leading the way. He's simply terrific here and not once do you ever feel as if you're watching an actor doing a part. You really do feel as if you're watching a real man battle with his beliefs. Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer are all terrific as well.I usually hate when a new movie opens and it gets labeled ""the greatest"" this or ""the greatest"" that. I honestly think films need time to grow and time to become a classic but I honestly have no reservation calling this film something truly special. It works on every level and it's really a masterful piece of filmmaking and it shows once again that Gibson is one of the greatest director's working.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Good Movie, Although A Bit Uneven","Mel Gibson is a very good film director, and a very fine actor, although not without failures or errors on his way. His resume is fairly spectacular, and here he touches upon a very delicate and a very serious subject - the conflict between religious beliefs and military duties. Desmond Doss was a very famous Seventh Day Adventist who took part in Battle Of Okinawa and due to his belief never took up a rifle and never killed anyone, but he saved as many as 100 lives of wounded soldiers and officers. The film is about this modest and brave man, who spared no effort to save his comrades. Was the film a success? Well, with all the coming Oscar nods, and with Mel Gibson and a stellar cast behind, this is very tough to be very critical. Let's say this - the movie is good, but not awesome, good but not perfect. This is not Saving Private Ryan or The Longest Day, for sure. Why? Well, there are some almost cringe-worthy pathetic scenes, that awake all the worst clichés of Hollywood, the battle scenes are impressive but hardly anything but already many times repeated gruesome bloody things. The slower part of the movie is often boring and too slow, and the main actor, well he is OK, but sorry, not higher than just average.

A Rated R Movie That's Very Inspirational.,"""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a very inspirational and gripping war film directed by Mel Gibson. It shows what strong faith and staying true to what you believe can do.

He faces many challenges because of his faith even before he hits the battlefield. This makes for very interesting story.

Howell, Hugo Weaving playing the part of Tom Doss, and Andrew Garfield playing the part of Desmond Doss, the cast was just about perfect.

Simply as Good as it could have been,"It has been just a while since the movie released and I have already watched it three times. This movie is beautiful and emotional. Mel Gibson has made a perfect comeback and I do think, not appreciating his work and his film would be totally unfair. The score is the backbone to the film just like Braveheart. I really loved Rupert-Gregson Williams work and I would compare it to likes of Hans Zimmer and Late James Horner. The movie is more about a love story than War, instead this film actually condemns war. If the critics stop their hatred for Mel Gibson then this will certainly be Best Picture and will wind up the whole Academy Awards. Andrew Garfield's intense acting fuels the film and keeps you interested. The only problem that I found in the film was that a lot of actors had their accent, this I found quite minor and not notable. People complaining about the violence will be shocked to see how beautifully Mel has handled those scenes. I would compare it to Saving Private Ryan and I personally feel like I has an edge over Spielberg's Movie. I am myself a Jew and I don't like Mel Gibson for his Anti-Semitic attitude, but denying his art would be wrong. ****I LOVED IT****",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Doss (Andrew Garfield) reads the Bible and promises that he will never take up arms or use them against other human beings . Desmond then saves the life of a walker , experiencing a wholesome satisfaction in the process . In the hospital, he is smitten by a beautiful nurse (Teresa Palmer), who he then dates. After the United States enters the Second World War, both sons are voluntereed to enlist , adding to the ire of the daddy who despises his sons joining the Army. Thing go wrong when the rigorous regimen of training in the Army requires Desmond to use his firearms training. As Desmond was firstly accused by his companions as a coward , as he has taken a religious oath to shun weapons ,tater on , they will change their minds . Based on the incredible true story. When the order came to retreat, one man stayed.This great story is based on facts , about one of the greatest heroes in American history never fired a bullet, this is Private Desmond Doss who inspired us about an incredible-bravery-true story on Hacksaw Ridge at the Battle of Okinawa , as he was the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor . The film is justly divided into two parts , the first dealing with the local existence of our starring , including a touching love story with a nurse , and the second one in which the protagonist goes into action as a paramedic in the war front . Of course, the best part is when he goes to the war front to fight the Japanese, when the regiment get posted to Hacksaw Ridge, Okinawa ; his staging is downright extraordinary. Here is where the movie really shines, including lots of epic scenes, impressive battles with explosions, gunshots and lots of deaths. And the final images are really moving and spectacular , all these scenes really add value to the film, which can well be described as magnificent . There are many sensitive scenes and the glorification of essential human values such as sacrifice , fellowship , bravery , heroism and faith in God. These values are well highlighted in our protagonist Doss who sacrifices himself for others and for God. Very good acting by Andrew Garfield as the good-natured young whho vows not to harm another human in his life . He's well accompanied by a stunning cast such as Hugo Weaving , Rachel Griffiths , Teresa Palmer, Vince Vaughan , Sam Worthington , Richard Roxburgh, among others , all ot them provide compelling interpretations.It displays a rousing and stirring musical score by Rupert Gregson-Williams who replaced James Horner for the final cut . As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by Simon Duggan . The motion picture was competently directed by Mel Gibson and shot in fifty-nine days. This great actor and filmmaker has directed some good movies , such as : The Man Without a Face , Braveheart , The Passion of the Christ and his last one : Apocalypto. And this Hacksaw Ridge(2016) is rated 8.5/10. The filck will appeal to WWII aficionados and Andrew Garfield fans . Essential and indispensable seeing , better than average . Well worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An unexpectedly entertaining journey through the cruel depths of war.,"Hacksaw ridge is by far Mel Gibson's best movie as director; it had all the criteria for it to be this year's best picture. It is a calm journey through the life of a simple yet unstable southern family; it brought us to admire the simplest joys of life, the happy and loving daily life of the American suburban families before the war. This movie showed us the true meaning of love and compassion and restored our hope in humanity. And then as expected gave us its obscure side, throwing us in the most well directed and performed war decors ever filmed, a true human carnage between the seemingly weak American army and the ruthless Japanese battalions. Hacksaw ridge is a story of pain and suffering and war, but it also represents the eternal fight between good and evil, and by that not meaning the two armies themselves but the true battle between faith and despair. Hacksaw ridge is truly a modern odyssey. One of the most crucial elements of such an amazing quest is the protagonist Desmond doss, a man of iron will and unbreakable faith who tried to save humanity in my opinion from violence and war. Portraying such a persona is undoubtedly a great challenge, and Andrew Garfield was up to it: The young actor exhibited with the help of the industry's veteran Mel Gibson one of the most sincere performances in the history of war films, his great acting skills were a key element to the success of this picture. The character of private doss was itself a fascinating trait that contributed to the critical acclamation this picture had received, he is as Andrew Garfield perfectly fits a man of a poor physique yet of great courage and altruism, his a medic that dived head first into the hordes of dead in the battlefield without hesitation, he is a loving husband, a great son and a true patriot who stood willingly in the face of the dreadful war in japan in order to save his fellow brothers in arms. In this dire times , the only one who truly stood by the side of private doss was his father Thomas , a good turned cruel man that lived to tell about the war to end all wars, he was disturbed and traumatised , something that Hugo weaving mastered on screen , he was such a great cast choice and delivered more than what was needed from a secondary character, he visualized in every move he did and every word he spoke the true horrors of war, he was all the time dark and shocked demonstrating what a war could do to a country, a family and a man. To sum it up, hacksaw ridge is definitely a must watch, it's by far one of this year's most exciting and overwhelming pictures. It is a top notch movie that depicts unprecedentedly the march of one man to end a war, it's the story of a real war hero who chose not to take the life of his brethren, and it's a movie for the director Mel Gibson to be proud of.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A real war story told realistically.,"""I have seen stalks of corn with better physiques."" Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn)Director Mel Gibson is an action genius and along with that compliment, let's add he knows his violence. Hacksaw Ridge is a true and heroic story of the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor for bravery in battle. Brave also could be any attempt to separate the film from its controversial director, but I'll let the film speak for itself.The contradiction is real: Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) was a Seventh Day Adventist who not only refused to work on Saturdays, but he also refused even to touch a gun. Through the intervention at a court martial of his improbably brave and conflicted father (Hugo Weaving), Doss is allowed to serve as a medic under those conditions, proving to all that he could be braver saving men at Okinawa's Hacksaw Ridge than anyone else (75 men as a medic with a flair for ingenious rescuing).Although Director Gibson is best known for his graphic depictions of violence in Apocalypto and The Passion of the Christ, he can also be accused, along with writers Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan, of clichéd story telling. The film's two parts, at home and at war, follow some pretty trite set-ups such as the mountain boy smitten by the nurse, the call to righteous service, the tough drill sergeant ( a terrific Vince Vaughn, see opening quote), and the sentimental trench dialogue.Yet these flaws work when the story needs them to establish Doss's kind heart, courage, and the essential goodness of fellow combatants as they confess they misread him and his conscientious objection. If you can forgive the almost unreal, lush setting for his youth in Lynchburg, Virginia, and his mooning for his future wife, Dorothy (Teresa Palmer), then you will enjoy seeing a real hero in a real war.Yes, Gibson knows how to depict action, not just pain, and it helps make Hacksaw Ridge a welcome addition to war films that tell true stories. And lest I forget, welcome back, Mel; you have been redeemed.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Stirring War Film,"The resistant soldier has been a theme for many films over the years. The young man here who serves as a medic has several good reasons for not carrying a gun. Apparently, putting yourself into harms way, unarmed is not adequate to keep you from being tormented. This could have been a cliche, but the acting is superb, the effects amazing, and the pacing works wonderfully. Basing it on an actual Medal of Honor recipient gives it a little push ahead of most others.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mel Gibson's Triumphant Return,"Mel Gibson returns behind the camera a full 10 years after his last directorial outing in Apocalypto (2006). Mel Gibson has proved to be a master when it comes to direction particularly when he is constructing a battle scene. However, being a full 21 years after Braveheart (1995) I myself was a little worried that Gibson had gotten a little rusty. Regardless of this, when I heard he was going to direct another war film I was very excited to see him back behind the camera. But the question remains. Has Gibson lost a step in his 10 year hiatus from directing? The answer is NO. Mel Gibson has proved that he has perfected his craft and in my opinion he is the best when it comes to crafting a battle sequence. The action is gritty, violent, realistic and most of all, it is absolutely terrifying. The battles in this film resemble a horror movie and a few times I even jumped. The intensity is constantly cranked up to 100% through out the second half of the film. Notice that I said 2nd half, that is because through out the 1st half this film is about the Character of Desmond Doss, played by Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spiderman, 99 Homes), struggling to stay true to his beliefs and attempting to prove to his peers that he is no coward. There is also a very heartfelt love story between Doss and his girlfriend Dorothy, played by Teresa Palmer (Lights Out), their relationship in no way feels forced and feels very authentic. I was very shocked when during the first hour there was little to no violence considering this was a Mel Gibson picture, but don't make the mistake of thinking he is only skilled at directing battle scenes because the character build up portrayed by Gibson is enthralling and allows you to invest in the characters as actual people so you care about them when it all goes down. So all in all, Gibson has proved that he is without a doubt one of the top 5 directors working today and he has no doubt earned, in my opinion, an Oscar nomination for Best Director.The acting in this movie was something I worried about and again, I was proved so wrong. Everyone gives an outstanding performance most notably, Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving (The Matrix, V for Vendetta), Luke Bracey (Point Break, The November Man) and Vince Vaughn (Wedding Crashers, The Lost World).Andrew Garfield proves that he is more than just Spider-Man and he deserves the Oscar for Best Actor or at least a nomination. I have no doubt that he will win several awards and more importantly, his performance will go down as one of the best in recent memory and he truly blew me away.Luke Bracey gives the most surprising performance I have seen this year, maybe not an Oscar worthy performance but definitely a good, solid performance as a soldier fighting alongside Doss.Hugo Weaving gives maybe the best performance of his since The Matrix and is a possible candidate for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar as Doss' abusive, drunk father after serving in WWI.Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Teresa Palmer and really all others involved give great supporting Performances.I can safely say Hacksaw Ridge is the best war film since Saving Private Ryan with brutal, terrifying battle sequences, beautiful cinematography, and incredible performances. Hacksaw Ridge deserves multiple Oscar nominations including one for Best Picture. This will go down as a classic and one of the best war films of all time and I strongly recommended you go see this in theaters ASAP. 10/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great come back for Mel Gibson,"This was by far the best picture of the year and a great comeback for Mel Gibson. It didn't win best picture because of the politicization of the Oscars. No way that ""Moonlight"" even came close to this film. To win an Oscar now you have to be non-white and LGBT. It reminds me of how ""Saving Private Ryan"" lost to a ho-hum movie ""Shakespeare in Love."" People still watch SPR but who ever talks about the other movie. So I predict that Hacksaw Ridge will become a classic while the other movies is well forgotten. Hacksaw Ridge, on the other hand, is a story that is so unbelievable because it stretches all credibility but hits us in the face because it actually happened. One of those ""no one would believe it if they made a movie"" but it actually happened. The courage of that man going alone, unarmed, except for his faith in God, directly into the mouth of hell. I am not a Christian but the devotional aspect of this movie was very inspiring. I would recommend anyone to see this movie and forget the other movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Hacksaw Ridge marks a triumphant return for Mel Gibson.,"Ten years since his last directorial effort 'Apocalypto' and many were wondering if he could match the excellence of his previous work, especially since this hiatus consisted of many controversies for the actor/director. Well, I'm pleased to say that Hacksaw Ridge is most definitely one of the best war films of this century. A bold claim such as this needs proof, and I always say ""proof is in the pudding"". Detailing the efforts of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who refused to carry a weapon, during the battle for Hacksaw Ridge against the Japanese. Illustrating the heroism, valour and bravery of one man who, through inner strength and conviction, saved the lives of many wounded soldiers. I am a sucker for good old fashioned Hollywood stories about a hero who defied all the odds. Everyone and everything was against Doss, including the rest of his unit at first, which automatically creates emotional investment towards our protagonist. You want him to succeed in his endeavours, you want him to prove all the naysayers wrong. He does...and then some. Through visceral direction from Gibson, who honestly directed the heck out of this, Doss was portrayed enigmatically by Garfield. Balancing both innocence and conviction in equal measures to produce a character that breaks your heart. Every facial expression and action Garfield makes feels natural and racks up to be one of his best performances. Supported by an excellent cast, particularly Vaughn, Weaving and Worthington, who provide backstory and development to what could've been expendable assets. The battle scenes were breathtakingly claustrophobic, the usage of blood and violence contradicts the religious subtext in the narrative which further enhances the ideologies of pacifism. Countless bodies on fire and limbs gliding through the explosions, just relentless filmmaking. The overuse of melodrama during the first half did provide an unusual tonal shift for the second half, took me a while to adjust. But, in the end, all I have to say is ""Mel, welcome back!"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Oh Good Grief Mel Gibson,"Good grief Mel Gibson, can you please try for at least a little bit of nuance in your movies?As he did with ""The Passion of the Christ,"" Gibson takes an overly-righteous and ham-fisted religious story and uses it as a screen to hide the giant boner he has for gratuitous violence. His obsession with pairing religious sentiment and the destruction of the human body, and the fact that his audiences seem to lap it up, is incredibly disturbing to me. It's like people think it's fine to wallow in gore as long as they're praying while doing it.That Gibson quality isn't quite as egregious here as it was in ""Christ,"" because much of this movie is set on WWII battlefields, and those were gory places. ""Christ"" was torture porn; this is more like Gibson watched ""Saving Private Ryan,"" turned to Steven Spielberg, and said, ""Hold my beer."" I don't really mind any movie that shows how horrible war is, even if I distrust the motivations behind it.And Gibson can direct action scenes, I'll give him that. Much of the film is devoted to combat scenes, and they are admittedly pretty gripping, which is why I can give this movie as high a rating as I am despite all of my criticisms of it. Where ""Hacksaw Ridge"" becomes intolerable is in the hagiography of its main character, played by Andrew Garfield. Garfield tries, but he's no match for Gibson's determination to make his character a religious icon rather than an actual human being. If Gibson is to be believed, Andrew Garfield single-handedly won WWII. I laughed out loud at some of the scenes toward the end, with Garfield turning into the world's first pacifist superhero. And that shot of Garfield posed like Christ against a backdrop of heavenly sunlight as he's helicoptored away --- give me just a little break.The film's highlight is a scene set in the barracks when we're first introduced to Vince Vaughn's drill sergeant. It's hilarious and like something out of a completely different movie -- like ""Police Academy"" -- but it's what I remember most.Grade: B.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Boring and cheesy,"Great graphics and high budget, of course. The standard boring music doesn't even matter, after you notice the big bad problem: there is no scenario, absolutely no intrigue or plot, nothing actually happens, there are no negative characters, there is no actual threat or problem to be solved, no twist, no surprise, nothing. So: boring. Predictable. Heroic. Anachronistic. Full of cliché-s. No plot whatsoever. Poor simple guy has small childhood trauma, grows up to be a fine man, goes to war, is a hero. Now, this might be a summary of a great movie; but in our case, it is everything you will find out in this one. There is, literally, nothing else. I am afraid of saying unrealistic as well, because the character was probably pretty much as depicted. Still, the portrayal is anachronistic, quite false. In fact, we have this huge powerful invading American army, smashing through all defenses of the small bad sadistic Japs (as expected) (no surprise here) (difficult to sympathize, but anyway, need to have some baddies around). And here we have an unarmed winning hero saving the poor lives of the poor victors without consideration to his own life, while his mates massacre their enemies all around, and supporting through his actions the whole round massacre, for a not-really clear reason. I mean, we love Gibson and he managed to do some great cliché heroic movies, so I was expecting more from this one. Just ain't.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
This film packs a brutal punch.,"The amazing story of Desmond T. Doss, the first CO (conscientious objector) to be awarded a medal of honour. Pushed to the limits and bullied for his beliefs, this film truly is a story of triumph over adversity.Hacksaw Ridge is a very powerful movie, it really did put me in mind of Braveheart, not just because of Mel Gibson's presence, but the sheer scale of it, power of the story, and the remarkable, very real use of violence.Gibson certainly knows how to direct a film, it's incredibly well paced, the cinematography is phenomenal, you almost feel as though you're close to the action, you can almost smell the gunpowder.The last few years have been a goldmine for World War II films, we've had 1917, Dunkirk and more, all are so different, this is a film I've enjoyed rewatching several times.The first half of the film introduces Doss, gives his background, and details his beliefs, brought up in a religious family, Doss has a strict moral and religious code. Andrew Garfield does a great job, what a removal from Spiderman.My advice would be to stick to popcorn, don't opt for a hot dog or spare ribs, there is a lot of violence, and several graphic scenes, graphic, but done to inform, not just to shock and entertain.Hugo Weaving is great, Teresa Palmer also does a fine job, the whole cast impress.I'd really recommend you giving this film a go.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Hacksaw Ridge was a compelling take on the heroism of one Desmond Doss,"Watched this with my movie theatre-working friend yesterday, the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. Desmond Doss was a conscience objector during World War II meaning he refused to carry a gun while in the Army. He eventually managed to save many of his fellow comrades during the battle of Okinawa by moving them to safety using the rope tricks he learned during basic training. If you're familiar with director Mel Gibson's graphic take on The Passion of the Christ, those battle scenes shouldn't surprise here nor how long it is being depicted. Still, there's also a nice romance between Desmond and Dorothy (Andrew Garfield and Teresa Palmer) in the beginning parts.

Hacksaw Ridge (2016) An original true story that inspires human life,"Hacksaw Ridge begins as two young brothers are roughing each other up, fighting with each other with their father sitting on the front porch watching boys be boys. Next thing the viewer sees is the younger brother grabbing a brick and hitting his brother on the head. The mother and father quickly pick up their eldest of two sons, hoping their other son did not kill him, as he passes out. Nevertheless, the younger brother, whom is Desmond looks at the crucifix on the wall probably thinking he is going straight to hell if his brother dies. Flash forward a couple of years later. By now, you know the father beats up the mother, and possibly both his children because he is a drunk that was in WW I and cannot live with the atrocities of war and losing his friends in the military. In the meantime, Desmond takes an injured person to the hospital and meets his future wife who is a nurse with beautiful red hair with blue eyes. Desmond is quite mesmerized with her so much so that he must donate blood, a task that she has been assigned to that particular day. While there, he decides he wants to be a medic in the army. Desmond's brother enlists as well as all the rest of the boys in their town. Desmond feels it is his duty. Flashforward to basic training with Vince Vaughn as his sergeant and his fellow officers. They are all friends and getting along until Desmond will not bear arms. However, he is an Adventist and will not bear arms to kill a soul. He feels he can fulfill his duty as a medic. Then, the top officials in the ARMY find out his dilemma. They court marshall him. I won't spoil this part for you. Then, he goes overseas to Japan. While over there, the soldiers are made to learn everybody is different in a life changing way and not everybody is what they seem. The viewer definitely sees the ugliness of a war and the pure hell of death, but with this film's fabulous way of inspiring a man, it is most definitely worth seeing. A very original film and the best one I have seen in a very long time. Kudos to Mel Gibson.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Ignore the critics,"Quite a few critics in the UK have panned this film as ""schmaltzy"" or a ""pastiche"" of warfare films. Ignore them.Bottom line is - the story is fairly slow to get going. It's too slow to get through the back-story of his early life and only gets going after Doss arrives at Fort Jackson for basic training. From that moment on, the film starts to build up to what this is really all about - how he won the Medal of Honor (which is not a spoiler).When they get to Hacksaw Ridge, there's 5-6 minutes of warfare gore that is totally full-on. Rightly so - it's disrespectful to those that served and died to depict their sacrifice and experience as anything other than unbelievably awful.Then, just sit back and watch what Doss did next.

"In God, and Doss, we trust","Those dreaded words – ""Based On A True Story"" – emerge again from the blackness of the opening page. Actually, no. In a move that could be considered arrogant if it wasn't so well researched, here we even lose the first two words.When a war film is described as being ""visceral"" then you know you need to steel yourself mentally for what you might see. But given that this film is based around the horrendously brutal combat between the Americans and the Japanese on the Pacific island of Okinawa in 1945 this is a warning well-founded. For the battle scenes in this film are reminiscent of the opening scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" in their brutality: long gone are the war films of John Wayne where there would be a shot, a grasp of the stomach and a casual descent to earth.But before we get to the battle itself, the film has a leisurely hour of character building which is time well spent (although it could have perhaps been trimmed a tad tighter). Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield, ""The Amazing Spiderman"", ""Never Let Me Go"") grows up a God- fearing youngster in the beautiful surroundings of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. His alcoholic father (Hugo Weaving, ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""The Matrix"") has been mentally traumatised by the First World War, further strengthening Desmond's fervent belief in following the Ten Commandments; most notably ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"". But his patriotic sense of duty is also strong, and Doss signs up after Pearl Harbor and is posted to a rifle brigade that – given his refusal to even touch a rifle – puts him on a collision course with the US Army. It also (obviously) disrupts his romance with nurse sweetheart Dorothy (Teresa Palmer).This is really two films in one, with the first half setting up extremely well the characters that make the second half so effective. For you care – really care – for what happens to most of the characters involved, especially the zealous and determined Doss who has nothing to face the Japanese hoards with but a medical bag. The feelings that comes to top of mind are awe that these real people actually had to go through this horror and hope that in today's increasingly unstable political world we will never need to again face such inhumanity of man against man again.Andrew Garfield really carries this film, and his Best Actor Oscar nomination is well-deserved. He is perfectly cast as the (onward) Christian soldier. Also outstanding is Hugo Weaving in an emotional and persuasive role playing opposite Rachel Griffiths (""Saving Mr Banks"") his wife. But the real acting surprise here for me was Vince Vaughn (""The Wedding Crashers"") who plays the no-nonsense platoon Sergeant Howell: never one of my favourite actors, here he brings in a warm and nuanced performance that ends with a memorable action scene.Also worthy of specific note is Dan Oliver (""Mad Max: Fury Road"") and his team of special effects technicians, the stunt teams (led by Kyle Gardiner and Mic Rodgers), production designer Barry Robinson and the hair and makeup team, all of who collaborate to make the final half of the film so gripping.The film marks a comeback from the film society 'naughty step' of Mel Gibson after his much publicised fall from grace in the mid- noughties. A Best Director Oscar nomination would appear to cement that resurrection. For this is a phenomenal achievement in direction and one that should be applauded.The film bears closest comparison with the interesting two-film combo from Clint Eastwood – ""Flags of our Fathers"" (from the American viewpoint) and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" (from the Japanese viewpoint). While all three films share the same blood and guts quotient, with ""Hacksaw Ridge"" edging this award, the Eastwood films tend to have more emotional depth and a more thought-provoking treatment of the Japanese angle. In ""Hacksaw Ridge"", while the war crimes of the Japanese are clear, the war crimes of the Americans are quietly cloaked behind a cryptic line (""They didn't make it"").That being said, there is no crime in a rollicking good story well told, and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is certainly that. This was a film I did not have high hopes for. But I was surprised to be proved wrong.

"A great movie about war , from a different point of view","War movies , as a whole are only guns ,killings and distinctively tough main characters. Some of them are a little bit different and that's a detail that counts. This great movie is one of them! A superb movie in total with great directing and camera movements. It's screenplay and scenario are perfect and ""fresh"", but there are two other things that made ""hacksaw ridge"" so good in my opinion : firstly the deep and complete character development and secondly the excellent acting performance from Andrew Garfield ( something that I wasn't really expecting , to be honest ).

Cult classic,"This movie is terrible! Close to insane. Mel got a budget, and spends every bit.The portrayal of war and training for war is pure Hollywood. It is laughable.BUT, the message of a CO in wartime sticking to it, and serving humanity is well done. The dude is a Medal of Honor winner, and you can't argue with that.I am a big fan of early war films with John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, David Lean and Richard Attenborough...... I'm ok with war being phony and jingoist, as long as you are telling a good story. This film is just over-the-top insanity.So, why do I think it is a cult classic? It is well-made. It fulfills the director's vision. It also is singular in its vision. It is hysterical in its portrayal. It is laughable in its reduction of complex human behavior and events.It is pure Mel Gibson. The Patriot is very similar. The Bad Guys are so bad, and the Good Guys are soooo good that a thinking person becomes uncomfortable.It is a film so bad, that it wraps around and becomes good. Interesting? People can study this film and investigate their own emotions about war, violence, religion and civil disobedience. It is affecting.Australian Gibson correctly portrays the IJA as blood-thirsty demons. That is a plus for the young people. Learning the horror of Okinawa is a valuable lesson for peace.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
11 out of 10 for Desmond,"Having just watched 'Hacksaw Ridge', and then immediately after the 2002 bio-doc about Desmond T. Doss's life, I can easily understand why Mel Gibson needed to give this story the Hollywood treatment. After a little research, almost unbelievably, this 'myth-making' Gibson movie turns out to be an accurate portrayal of the man, and a pretty accurate account of history.The movie isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn good. What affects the viewer more than the brutal violence of war on display, more than the performances of the cast, more than Gibson's direction, is the unflinching determination, unselfish bravery, compassion and faith the real Desmond Doss showed throughout his life.What a character.Hats off to Desmond.

"More Captain America, than Pacifist war Hero","I was looking forward to watching this film. I heard about Desmond Doss a pacifist war hero was awarded the Medal of Honor. I believed a great story could be told without having to go over the top. It must have been very strange for the other soldiers training and fighting with a man who held such strong beliefs against killing others. I expected the director to look at Mr Doss and his colleagues from a psychological point of view I was hoping to see something akin to Platoon. No! What we got was more akin to Captain America. In the hands of Mel Gibson, Desmond Doss was more of a cartoon character than a real hero. It was so over the top I was actually embarrassed. Now for a fictitious character this movie would be OK. It was well made, well acted, with lots of action. Mel sold this film base don Desmond Doss and then he failed to tell his story. Don't watch this film expecting anything special it is a generic American war film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An Anti-War and Pro-War Movie...Pretension and Cliché Embraced with Ease,"Mel Gibson's Directorial Return, after a 10 Year Hiatus, is neither an Anti-War or Pro-War Film, it is both.If it wasn't a Documented True Story of Conscientious Objector Desmond Doss who Refused to Touch a Gun, although Enlisting to Serve in WWII, one might get the Impression that the Film was Allegorical about the Resurrected Jesus Christ.That Impression is Felt once the Movie's Second Half turns to the Battle of Okinawa and the ""Hero"" of the New Testament finds Himself in a Hell that is the Human Condition and still Maintains the ""Love Thy Neighbor"" and ""Turn the Other Cheek"" Demeanor that He, by Example, Maintains throughout the Carnage and Slaughter.The Film is Grounded with Good Performances, not only Andrew Garfield, but also with Hugo Weaving as Doss's Father Riveting and Bristling with Gravitas, and others Contributing the Fleshing Out (literally) needed to make the Movie Mesmerizing.The Battle Sequences get a lot of Ink and they are Visceral with the Violence Sharply Cutting on the Edges of the Frame as Garfield's Doss Centers the Action with a Calm that Defies Normal Human Reaction. It's as though He is Cloaked with Protection from an Unearthly Source.The Film is Rife with War Movie and World War II Era Clichés that are Presented with a Pretension of Ease and seem Ironically Necessary to tell the Story. The First Half Develops the Desmond Doss Character and the Second Half Deconstructs the Convictions of His Belief.A Fine Film that is Recommended and Deserves the Attention it has Received because in its Glorious Simplicity it is Accomplished and a Rewarding Experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Oscar worthy!!!,"I just saw Hacksaw Ridge and thought it was a great movie. The story was well told, the actors did it justice and the battle scenes were the best I've seen. It gave a frightening view of how war really is hell. The word ""hero"" is used too lightly today, usually for multi million dollar earning sports stars...but these soldiers were the real thing. Mel Gibson has made a worthy tribute not just to the main character, but to all the brave guys who endured and sacrificed so much so that we can sit in our homes with the freedom to speak our minds. While I don't agree with the anti-Semitic views that Mel Gibson uttered when he was being arrested, I feel he has done his penance and shouldn't be ostracized by the Academy....and I bet there are quite a few among Hollywood's actors who have similar unacceptable views about Jewish people, gay people, anyone who is not white etc etc....but they are careful not to let it slip in public. Hacksaw Ridge deserves to win multiple Oscars and it would be a travesty if it doesn't do so.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Truth in advertising - ""Hacksaw Ridge"" IS one of the best war films since ""Saving Private Ryan"".","Have you ever been misunderstood? Maybe you just failed to communicate your thoughts effectively. Maybe you said or did something that cast doubt on your true intentions. Or maybe others just ascribed to you negative motives of people they've known in the past – and failed to judge you based on your own actions. We've all been there, but few of us have had to risk as much for our convictions as World War II Army medic Desmond T. Doss. You see, as a Seventh-day Adventist, Doss took the Bible literally. To him, the sixth commandment means God forbids killing anyone – ever – for any reason – even in war. He volunteered to be a medic in the war, but even in basic training, he steadfastly refused to even touch a gun. The law calls someone like Doss a conscientious objector. His fellow soldiers just called him a coward. That is until they went into battle with him. Desmond's struggle to live out his principles, in spite of what others thought, and through the horrors of war, is the story of ""Hacksaw Ridge"" (R, 2:11).As a child, Desmond (Darcy Bryce) developed a strong religious faith – and a strong aversion to violence. He and his brother physically fought each other often. One of those times, Desmond hit his brother with a brick, nearly killing him. Desmond's father, Tom (Hugo Weaving) used to beat his boys, and sometimes got physical with their mother, Bertha (Rachel Griffiths). Tom himself was a shell of a man who never shook memories of the violence he saw as a soldier in World War I, constantly visiting the graves of his friends who died in that war. All of this had a profound effect on Desmond in his formative years.The adult Desmond (Golden Globe nominee Andrew Garfield) not only wants to avoid doing what he believes God prohibits, but he wants to do good things to help others. After saving the life of an accident victim by applying a tourniquet – and meeting a pretty local nurse named Dorothy (Teresa Palmer) – he develops a strong desire to study medicine. Even as he courts Dorothy, he feels drawn to do his part in the war – as an Army medic. As he says when defending his belief in non-violence, ""With the world so set on tearing itself apart, it don't seem like such a bad thing to me to put a little bit of it back together."" Desmond may avoid violence, but violence sure finds him – and sooner than he expected. His drill instructor, Sgt. Howell (Vince Vaughn), and his company commander, Cpt. Glover (Sam Worthington), greet Desmond's convictions with frustration. His fellow trainees, especially people like Smitty Ryker (Luke Bracey), express their feelings towards him by attacking him in the barracks. When Cpt. Glover's boss, Col. Stelzer (Richard Roxburgh) gives Desmond a direct order to pick up a weapon and he refuses, the young recruit finds himself facing the possibility of an Army court martial – and maybe prison time.Eventually, Cpl. Desmond Doss and his company find themselves arriving on the Japanese island of Okinawa in the closing months of the war. Now less than 400 miles from mainland Japan, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps experienced some of the fiercest fighting of the war – with some of the highest casualty rates. Doss' company is tasked with driving the Japanese soldiers off of Hacksaw Ridge – an area of land 400 feet above the beach. To accomplish their mission, the troops had to climb up a rocky cliff face using only a rope ladder – and then face well-entrenched Japanese forces which had vowed to fight to the death. Doss and his company charge straight toward danger. Not everyone would survive, but those who did, were Doss' responsibility – a mission for which he repeatedly put his life on the line.I often find reviewers' comments in a movie's advertising to be overblown but not in this case. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" IS one of the best war films since ""Saving Private Ryan"". The battle scenes in this film are even more graphic and intense than the scenes of D-Day in ""Ryan"", and features the most realistic Pacific Theater action since 2006's ""Flags of Our Fathers"". But like those other two, this film is more a story about the men who fought the war than the battles themselves. This is a bio-pic, so there's plenty of character development. It's a story about principles and courage, so there's plenty of struggle and heroism. And, as I said in my first paragraph, this is a story about misperceptions and, in the end, understanding and mutual respect, which contains lessons for all of us. This is a touching human story and an unflinching look at the horrors of war and the value of different kinds of heroism. ""A""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mel Gibsons Massive Comeback With A Amazing Movie,"Movie: Mel Gibson's MASSIVE comeback to the movie industry by directing Hacksaw Ridge, a movie about Desmond Doss and how he went into World War 2 without any self defense serving as a medic and became the first conscientious objector in American history to be rewarded the medal of honour. This movie blew away people across the world and movie critics are scoring high. Desmond Doss's actions in the movie were based on truly heroic true events, which needed to be carried out with a lot of courage and bravery. The movie also gives you a brutally honest R rated (American classification) vision of what happened in that war and how similar events were carried out in other wars.Actors and directors: Andrew Garfield known as The Amazing Spiderman, played Desmond Doss with Excellency and had the right physical and verbal appearance to suit the roll. Another actor, Vince Vaughn who played Sergeant Howell, played him with great acting skills and character. Otherwise there's nothing to complain about the actors, they were all spectacular. Mel Gibson did this movie and man, what a comeback. If Mel Gibson didn't direct this movie, the whole movie would go in another direction. His last movie Expendables 3 in 2014 was the last we saw of him for 2 years. We know him as violence movie maker with movies such as Brave heart and Passion of the Christ, and boy is this a lot of gore and violence. But, it is good as it gives you the true explanation of what happened in the movie and real life and that is what makes the movie great and makes people's minds widen up to the subject of war and what really happened with scenes with amputated body parts and decapitations, as some people cover their eyes while there is the other people sucked into the movie.Feedback: I strongly recommend everyone to go see this movie, especially people interested in war and movies with a catholic impact. The movie has a strong catholic impact to the story, with his faith giving him strength, people who are seeking Catholic movies, I recommend watching this. But if you are sensitive to gore, watch if you dare. Similar movies like this like Unbroken and American Sniper only got 7.1 & 7.2 from IMDb, which to me is pretty unexplainable, but I have to admit, Hacksaw Ridge tops the list. This movie got an astounding 8.7/10 from IMDb making it one of the most highest ranked movies ever, which to me is well deserved! This story and movie is just amazing! I rate Hacksaw Ridge 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A masterful film.,"Once again Mel Gibson delivers a masterful film and a breath of fresh air in the war film genre.Hacksaw Ridge hits on every aspect that a war movie should, action, drama, suspense, and heartbreak.But within the insanity of war, lies a story a true hero and patriot, Pfc. Desmond T. Doss. A man who risks his life and puts himself last in order to save the lives of others.This movie is a true inspiration and juxtaposes that even within the monstrosities of war there can be true hope and beauty within the battlefield and teaches us that violence is not the only answer and that it is honorable to refuse to commit murder in the act of war.The cinematography is beautiful and captures the essence of each scenario beautifully, whether it's a dark and gloomy war ridden Okinawa, or a small town in the USA, accompanied by an amazing score and very good editing.I would say this movie is a very emotional thrill ride that will leave you inspired, heartbroken and speechless.See it.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Surprisingly Enjoyable Film,"WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield), who served during the Battle of Okinawa, refuses to kill people, and becomes the first man in American history to receive the Medal of Honor without firing a shot.Based on the posters and previews and such, I really thought this was going to be a war movie. And, of course, in many ways it is, since much of the second half takes place on the battlefield. But there is much more here -- romance, morality, and the strong will of Doss, an unusual Seventh Day Adventist.What made this film especially great was the inclusion of Vince Vaughn. Although he never turned the film into a comedy, he brought a humor to the story that really made it well-rounded and enjoyable. That was a fine bit of casting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mel Gibson Snuff Comedy/ Gore Film,"I saw Hacksaw Ridge last night here's my opinion.... I don't know if that was supposed to be a historically accurate movie, since they had the actual veterans that they interviewed at the end of the movie But it was more like a Mel Gibson snuff film glorifying the act of killing people and some weird Christian stuff too.IF it was supposed to be a historically accurate movie they probably should drop the scene of a BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle) gunner holding a limbless bloody human torso with one hand (like a shield) while running toward a Japanese position and firing the BAR with one hand. The most shocking part was that they stole the scene from Saving Private Ryan!! The Soldier's started throwing 60mm mortar rounds after bumping the bottom of the shells on their helmets. 😑 As if that was done on a regular basis. There were also several grenades having the pins pulled with teeth and lightly flicking them away. (FYI, if you try to do this in real life you will crack your teeth off). ....Followed by flamethrowers that were actually more like Dragon's breath, igniting dozens and dozens of Japanese soldiers. All this occurring on the screen with the audience behind me audibly saying "" Wow ""The actual cool part was when they showed the medic, heroically moving around the battlefield who ended up rescuing 75 men from Hacksaw Ridge.My one beef with this movie was that it is NOT A REALISTIC INTERPRETATION of what actually happened in WWII, in ANY sense This was more of a comedy/ glorifying gore... followed by actual interviews of real life veterans portrayed in the movie... WHICH, seemed to insinuate that everything you just watched was historically accurate. FAIL!!Also casting Vince Von to play a Sergeant 😑 with some opening scenes trying to mimic the full metal jacket humor, all of it.... epic fail and just hard to watch.On a scale of 1 to 10, the option of going to this movie or staying in my room and staring at the wall This was about a 2, and slightly better than staring at a wall...",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Truth is stranger than fiction,"Desmond Doss is one of those people whose story seems almost too perfect to be true. It's almost unthinkable that anybody would have the nerve to march into battle not carrying a weapon, and even more unthinkable that that person would somehow manage to save dozens of lives and win the respect of his armed peers in the process. But Desmond Doss did exactly that, and if the movie about his life portrays him as a gawky, unimposing saint, maybe that's just the way he was. Andrew Garfield is very good in the lead role here, bringing to life the sort of character who very easily could have felt like a cardboard cutout. The script sometimes leans a little too hard on clichés (I thought some of the supporting characters could have been more sharply drawn), but then again, this is a movie about Desmond Doss, and he is more than compelling enough to hold our attention.This movie is unflinchingly violent. ""The Passion of the Christ"" was nearly pornographic in how it portrayed Christ's suffering, and this film ladles on both the dismemberment and Christlike imagery. So it's not exactly subtle. Still, it's rare to see faith explored in a way that is both explicit and not overly preachy. Desmond Doss was a pacifist and devout Seventh Day Adventist, and like most good people of faith, he clearly sees his beliefs as a private and personal thing, even as he enlists in the military and disobeys a direct order to carry a rifle.""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a film that asks its audience just what lengths we are going to go to stand up for what we feel is right. It devotes much screen time to a legal battle, and while I will not go into the specifics here, suffice to say that it can be sorely tempting to give one's tormentors what one thinks they want in hopes of some temporary release. But that is not, forgive me, what Christ would have done. You don't have to be a Christian (or even religious at all) to enjoy this movie. You need a high tolerance for bloodshed, but that's about it. It's time Hollywood let Mel Gibson back into the fold.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Gibson nails it,"Gibson hit the mark on this war movie. While it starts off a bit slow it surely picks up the pace and doesn't let go. Vince Vaughn, who I had doubts playing in this movie, was a stand out. Just superb. The war scenes were brutal but realistic. Not for the squeamish. This movie is high on action, but not over the top ""expendables"" type, not that I don't enjoy those movies as well, but this is realistic. It is also inspirational. I for one am not or can never be a conscientious objector but what this soldier did and how he remained true to his convictions and why is what makes it inspirational. That and how he went from outcast to hero being himself. Another movie that used the real life people and soldiers at the end credits to show you the added realism of this movie ad that the actors and director did their homework, Screenwriters, too.

I heard grown men sobbing through that silence.Having grown up in Lynchburg I knew Doss's story well but the movie made it come to life. It's a lengthy movie but you really feel like they could've told so much more yet you leave w/an amazing respect for Doss and appreciation for the brutality of war.

Do not praise this boring film with your shallow patriotism,"I think Andrew Garfield might be the worst candidate who we could deem as an actor. I've watched every film he played as the leading character, including he masked and covered under a Spiderman suit. Yet every film I saw I just got the same feeling of wrong cast in a wrong movie. This guy as an actor to play so many different roles but no matter what, he just showed himself as a young guy who never could keep his mouth closed tightly enough but always mindlessly half opened with his lower lip further out than his upper lip, a guy with a abnormal long crane-like long and thin neck and a thick but not likable hairs on his head. He always gave off a nerdy and dumb expression no matter what he played. All of these shortcomings didn't fade or transform better when he grew older. There's no way that I could convince myself to believe any character he played but a stronger certainty of wrong casting jobs again and again.The whole screenplay just looks hollow, shallow and stereotyped. A trick that have been used thousand times to patch up a got-nothing-tell story, a popular and trendy way to advertise a sales pitch that this is a serious movie based on ""True Event"" or ""True Character"". But once these laughable words were used, only two things could immediately assured: A) There actually nothing to tell, i.e., No Beef, B) A certainty of a lousy movie.So this format we got here is like this: Two kid brothers growing up in a dirt poor family with a retired soldier father, a do-nothing drunk and a non-caring fatherhood; with an opposite loving and care mother, also a loyal church goer. The brother almost killed his kid brother during a playful fight in front of their parents when it became out-of-control. Then this brother repented himself by facing a Christian Bible picture on the wall, focusing on those hollow ""Thou shalt not kill"" dogma. And then that biblical crap became his one and only belief and faith that he later carried with it into Army boot camp. Then again, since the screenplay got actually nothing too much to say, a large segment of this film was forcefully to describe how this guy with such unpractical and anti-American valued Patriotism ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"" firm belief and principle to survive in the training camp. Again, more already used hundred times formula was borrowed again: A loud mouthed, always yelling and screaming Sergent and a bunch of tight-arsed high ranking officers, a beating, an almost being kicked out or even court-marshaled scene, a strong protest of his right as a qualified soldier who never wanted to hold a rifle to aim and kill then ultimate enemy, the Japanese soldiers. Then blah, blah and blah. Fighting scenes, his suddenly found unbelievable valor to save his brother-in-arms again and again in the battle field as a medic. And of course, casting a beautiful actress as his love, an eye-candy for the unfortunate viewers to ensure some possibility of increasing the box office....Supporting this hollow film with annoying patriotic background music...happily married and stayed together until his wife's early demise....Then of course, old faces in retrospection (a must) showed up on the screen in the final to certify that this is a true story.What we got here is just like branded powdered milk formula for your babies with an image of a not-quite-so-young-now funny face guy with thin and long neck and always mindlessly open mouth. Drink this milk, it's good for your health and your continued growth of your blind Patriotism.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A Wonderful Tale of a True War Hero Who Managed to Save Lives Without Lifting A Single Weapon,"Wow, this movie was very very good. At first I had my doubts about watching it, as when I saw the trailer, it seemed to be a too heavy movie for me. But as I said above, since there was not a lot of new interesting movie during this weekend (the other one was a horror movie which most likely I would be watching by myself sometime later), I really did not regret watching this one. It has everything from touching scenes, powerful moments, cool special effects, good make up effects, nice sound effects & music, and wonderful performances from the main characters.My wife and I really enjoyed the movie and I think unanimously the audience (which was almost full house by the way), were amazed at this one and some of them even clapped their hands after it was finished. Despite around half of the movie was a little bit dramatic, with some romance and the other half was about the war, we really did not feel the movie too long even though its running time was 2 hrs 11 minutes. And surprisingly, the movie that I saw was fully without cut scenes.Please be reminded though that the war scenes here were very brutal. Mel Gibson as the director did not make the war to be with elegant action scenes. They were totally what I believe a war would have been like. The scenes were gruesome and I really think that this is not a suitable movie for kids. So I would be surprised if parents would bring their children to watch this (which did not happen when I watched this one). The romantic scenes between Desmond and Dorothy was brief but nice and they seemed to have a believable chemistry.The movie also has so many morale messages and I think each one of us would have our own impression. My wife was truly inspired with the scene of Desmond's confusion of what he was supposed to do in the war when the answer came to him in such a manner. While I myself was amazed of how strong Desmond can stand for his beliefs even with so many challenges were thrown at him. Even though this was a war drama movie, it also has some few funny moments. My most memorable scene was during the first training of Desmond and his fellow infantry unit led by Sergeant Howell. Those were priceless scenes.Anyway, I think I am running out of praises to this movie. I understand that the movie got a 10 minute standing ovation after it was screened in the 73rd Venice Film Festival and it was widely considered as an Oscar worthy movie.

Don't miss it for the world.The characters, the story line, the music... Everything is simply breathtaking and every moment in the movie is worthwhile. It certainly feels much shorter than it really is.If you're looking for a movie with a deep meaning, a powerful message, and a lot of emotions, all conveyed with excellent cinematography, Hacksaw Ridge is the movie for you. While it may seem like another war movie, it'll shock you by the topics it deals with. It doesn't run short on originality.Mind that it has an overwhelming dose of violence and gore, and it's not suitable for the sensitive viewer.Hats off to Mel Gibson. Once again he proves that's he is an extraordinary director. Hats off to everyone involved in this masterpiece.Probably the best movie in the past 5 years, it's all what a movie should be like.10/10... it's been a long while...",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
respect,"Greetings again from the darkness. Why doesn't every high school student learn about Desmond Doss in History class? Beyond that, why isn't Desmond Doss profiled in every Psychology and Philosophy class? It's inexplicable that more Americans aren't familiar with his story, much less failing to honor his legacy with a well deserved tribute. Fortunately director Mel Gibson (Braveheart) and screenwriters Andrew Knight (The Water Diviner) and Robert Schenkkan (""The Pacific"") bring us a spirited look at this under-appreciated American war hero.Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man) plays Desmond Doss and perfectly embodies the conviction and dedication of this extraordinary (not hyperbole in this case) man. See, Desmond Doss was one of the first conscientious objectors in the U.S. Army. His religious beliefs (Seventh Day Adventist) prohibited him from using a weapon or killing another person  two things that don't go over well with fellow soldiers or commanding officers. Yet, Doss was committed to serving his country as a medic and saving lives, rather than taking them.Unbelievable may be the best description even though his story is absolutely true. Credited with saving the lives of at least 75 wounded soldiers, Doss and his fellow soldiers are depicted in the film fighting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge  a topographical challenge punctuated by the need to climb a rope wall in order to scale the face of the cliff. Their reward was facing thousands of Japanese hiding in tunnels and bunkers, waiting patiently to kill in mass. There will be no spoilers here on the courageous actions of Doss  you should see for yourself.The early part of the film features a heart-warming first love story involving Desmond Doss and Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer, The Choice). Watching young love bloom is precious and provides a stark contrast to the battle scenes. The two make a lovely couple and we can't help but root for them. Once Doss hits basic training, we find Vince Vaughn in the role of Sergeant Howell, Sam Worthington (failing to hide his Aussie accent) as Captain Glover, and Luke Bracey (Point Break, 2015) as Smitty, one of the soldiers who initially has no interest in serving with Doss. The Army Psychologist is played by Richard Roxburgh, whom movies lovers will recognize as The Duke from Moulin Rouge! (2001).Some of the best scenes involve Desmond's parents played by screen vets Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Both are excellent in roles requiring very different and extreme emotional moments. It's a credit to Gibson's filmmaking expertise that he is able to add depth to all aspects – family turmoil, a classic love story, the brutality of war, and the deep religious convictions. There are a few moments of ""artistic license"" and some of the CGI is inconsistent and even over-produced at times, but the intensity of the battle scenes rival that of Saving Private Ryan and the landing at Omaha Beach. It's a passionate piece of filmmaking centered on a most passionate man. You may disagree with much of what Mel Gibson has said and done in his personal life (and I hope you do), but as a film director he has earned much respect. And speaking of respect  Desmond Doss. Enough said.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Superb,"Wow!!!!! I don't know what to say to get across how excellent this film is. Mel Gibson has comeback with a boom ! Excellent Direction and the acting is superb. Andrew Garfield was brill as Spiderman but he's worth an Oscar in this.It starts off nice and slow and when it gets to Desmond (Garfield)refusing to carry a firearm you start to think, what a stupid boy. But once the real action starts you are just mesmerized, I don't think I breathed for minutes. What an amazing man Desmond Doss was and in your hour of need you most certainly want a man like him beside you. I thank you Mel Gibson for bringing this amazing man into our lives with a Superb tribute to him. Hacksaw Ridge is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brave,"Based on the true story of an army medic who insisted on never carrying a weapon, 'Hacksaw Ridge' tells a slice of World War II history that dares to redefine traditional notions of bravery. The graphic battle scenes are very well done with Gibson never shying away from the severity of battle wounds and how precious life in war is. For all is virtues though, the film often feels preachy with the protagonist's religion-motivated pacifism (and how this repulses everyone in the army) repeatedly brought up. A formulaic romance also weighs against the film and some of the casting is downright odd, with Vince Vaughn especially awkward as a drill sergeant who is hardly fearsome and seldom angry. The casting of Hugo Weaving as the medic's father is a stroke of genius though with Weaving stealing every scene as a former war veteran plagued by inner demons and horrific memories of World War I. Andrew Garfield is fine in the lead role, though against 'The Social Network', '99 Homes' and others, it is hardly his best work. Overall, this is an easy to film to recommend for those keen on unflinchingly realistic battle scenes and detailed insights into military bureaucracy. It is hardly a flawless film and perhaps a little message-heavy for its own good, however, it says quite a lot that the movie manages to pack a punch even when one knows about his heroism to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Incredible reality of war,"Hacksaw Ridge is a great movie. It's a war film, and of course graphic, but I have no doubt war looks like that. I've read other critics rag on the gore in this movie (as well as Gibson's other films), and I'm definitely not a fan of blood and gore, but this film had to be made this way. I believe Mel is brilliant, and not just with the war scenes. From beginning to end, Doss's life and journey and convictions amaze me. Getting to know the main character, and knowing this movie is based upon truth makes it more all the more incredible. The protagonist's internal conflict is real - and we see that. Great hero. Great movie. Great directing and acting by all the cast. I don't know movie terminology, but all involved in this film - excellent. Hacksaw Ridge is the real deal.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Saved by Private Doss,"If you see the trailers of this film it does not even to tell you who made this film. Instead you are told that it is from the Oscar winning director of Braveheart. It shows how much the Mel Gibson name is mud in some quarters.This is the first English language film directed by Gibson since Braveheart which was released in 1995. It is also notable that this film was made in Gibson's adopted homeland of Australia, the country his father relocated to in order that his older children would not be drafted to the Vietnam war. The film features many notable Australian actors.Hacksaw Ridge based on true events tells the story of army medic Desmond Doss who refused to hold a gun in battle but saves the lives of many of his comrades.The opening of the film is more hackneyed ridge than hacksaw. Doss father is an alcoholic who also seems to be suffering shell shock from The Great War, Desmond as a boy nearly kills his brother and then he vows to stick to the commandment 'thou shalt not kill.' The older Desmond (Andrew Garfield) finds romance with a nurse but after Pearl Harbour enlists to join the army but because of his beliefs as a conscientious objector, Doss intends to serve as a combat medic. At basic training Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) does the usual clichéd spiel of getting the raw recruits battle ready. Gibson is in on the joke as he has Garfield grinning throughout it all.Doss excels in his training but becomes an outcast when he refuses to handle his rifle and train on Saturdays as he is a Seventh-day Adventist. After Howell and his superiors fail to get Doss discharged for psychiatric reasons, Howell turns his fellow soldiers against him by making Doss out to be a coward.The film comes to life in the Battle of Okinawa. Gibson delivers a gory, violent fuelled, blood, guts and rats battle sequence where Doss goes about saving the lives of the injured soldiers. Doss considers whether this is his true purpose and why he is here.However despite the battle action being well staged, it has to be remembered that Spielberg got here almost twenty years ago in Saving Private Ryan.The film really suffers from a corny beginning and some parts of the script is pedestrian with the romance part certainly being cringe inducing. It is the battle segments that belatedly save the film but even then some of that gets silly such as one soldier holds a dead body as a shield in one arm, walks and fires a gun with the other or where Doss drags Howell in a makeshift sledge while Howells fires off his rounds.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
one of the worst war movies that I've ever seen,"I wonder what veterans of the battle had to say after watching this movie. There are many moments in this movie that make it look like Marvel's story. Unbelievable. Was there really only ONE rope ladder to climb for ALL American troops? Was there some kind of treaty with Japanese not to touch the ladder and let Americans climb till they reach the top and prepare for an attack? Everyone was just waiting for our hero to finish, ALONE,saving his wounded comrades? I used to respect Mel Gibson's work. Not anymore.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Hacksaw Ridge is a powerful, emotionally-charged and inspiring picture that examines the full horror of war","Hacksaw Ridge paints a powerful portrait of the importance of faith and basic respect for one and other, with an emotional and moving tale of a man who refused to lift a gun, making the decision to save lives rather than take them. It is a rough balancing act, but the film remains deeply effective and gripping, as well as violent but dignified at the same time, all of which coalesces into a worthwhile whole. For all its blood, gore, explosions and injury detail, it never forgets the human story it is telling and guarantees that the themes are always front and centre of the picture. Andrew Garfield delivers a career-best performance and Mel Gibson crafts this harrowing and violent tale with enough thought-provoking and moral questioning to ensure you are totally absorbed in this pacifist story. Each and every one of us can find inspiration in this one man's adherence to his true morals and beliefs and in turn will find this true meaning of strength and bravery in the darkest of circumstances.FULL REVIEW - https://goo.gl/wEiQfV",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the most carefully crafted war films I've ever experienced.,"Hacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and stars Andrew Garfield, Richard Pyros, Jacob Warner, Milo Gibson, Teresa Palmer, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths.Based on the incredible true story, WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss, who served during the Battle of Okinawa, refuses to kill people and becomes the first man in American history to receive the Medal of Honor without firing a shot.It's taken me a while to digest Mel Gibson's brutal epic Hacksaw Ridge, roaring with fire and an undying courage shown in Garfield's deeply rooted portrayal of Desmond T. Doss, but at this point after sitting on time for a moment, I can safely say that this is one of most carefully crafted war films I have ever had the pleasure to, in some ways, endure.Andrew Garfield's performance in this film is bitterly convincing, gripping the viewer with a biting display of emotion shown within the conscientious objector. A background of Doss' life is shown within the first 20 minutes, which aids his character and helps the viewer connect with his many decisions that occur during the heavily textured battle, leading to saving 75 lives on the front line. Not only does Garfield provide an emotional core, he goes through all kinds of hell, crawling between the gruesome display of the fallen and wounded.It would be all for nothing, however, without Gibson's skillful direction. He and cinematographer Simon Duggan capture the Art, Special Effects and Stunt department's hard work with eyes of an eagle, utilising smart camera set-ups that assist the unravelling chaos and destruction unfolding around the cast.The supporting cast of Luke Bracey, Richard Pyros, Jacob Warner, Teresa Palmer and Vince Vaughn are truly wonderful. Each individual provides a delightful back-and-fourth between themselves and Garfield. Vaughn breaks from his comedic persona (almost entirely) and shines light on a new side to his acting abilities. Many of his scenes are smartly written and engaging, whilst finding the perfect time to improvise his lines, adding a much-needed comic relief. Hugo Weaving is incredible in one of his best roles yet. Delivering a powerhouse performance that ties with Garfield's, showcasing several layers of hate, sadness and regret, detailed beautifully in his fine acting.Original music by Rupert Gregson-Williams is satisfactory, though missing something of great importance; distraught emotion. It's great at filling the gaps with heroic themes, but I never felt moved by the score in any huge way. In the final moments of the film I do admit to have felt hopeful and 'pumped' but I thought the score had an absence of fear and angst. This could be due to Gibson's direction though, as ultimately the director has the final say. However, I believe the space is filled with an impeccably thorough bed of sound, expertly created by the Sound Department and adeptly mixed and edited, earning 2 Academy Award nominations.The battle sequences are intricate and complex, captured beautifully in-camera and driven by highly intense and scary situations that spring up out of nowhere. It's a tough experience to get through, but it's undeniably well put together, seriously powerful and absolutely worth it.Verdict; Hacksaw Ridge is riveting and bathed in gore, however, underneath the brutality is a fine true story of survival and heroism.Hacksaw Ridge, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Inspiring Movie,"I went to see this movie with a group of friends as I'm not one for war films, gratuitous violence or horror, but I wanted to see this as I'd seen the reviews based on the true story of conscientious objector Desmond Doss in WW2. Well, all I can say is that this film was nothing short of inspiring. Yes it was violent, but to be honest the gory war scenes were necessary in order to give the viewer an idea of what Desmond Doss went through, the true atrocity of war, and a mans courage to serve when everything and everyone was against him. British actor Andrew Garfield gave an outstanding performance with a pretty much flawless American accent. Vince Vaughn was a surprise casting as Desmond's CO but gave a brilliant performance with his usual comedic delivery. I particularly liked the line when he asked one of the rookies how long he'd been dead!All I can say is that this film justly deserved its 2 Oscars and Mel Gibson should have been given the Lazarus award for resurrecting his career tooHighly recommend",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Mel Gibson sure has a lot of family members on IMDb,"Did I see the same movie as everyone else? An 8.2 rating for this holier than thou, self righteous yawnfest? Movies like these make Slaughtered Vomit Dolls look like Oscar material. Never in my life have I ever seen a movie as manipulative as this nonsense. Flooded with scenes that could make a grown man hurl, this unrealistic claptrap of a film is only worth viewing once, and of course, that's for the intense and magnificently- rendered violence you can always count on Brother Mel to produce.I guess there were just too many scenes that were pilfered from other movies that made me groan. The influence of Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, and especially, Full Metal Jacket, were WAY too obvious. Would it have killed Brother Mel to not portray the Japanese as one-dimensional, blood thirsty conquistadors? Left a bad taste in my mouth. Hacksaw Ridge. Sigh.

Great True Storytelling - Mel Gibson Does It Again,"Hacksaw Ridge is the true story, told the Mel Gibson way, of Desmond Doss.

Andrew Garfield is wonderful in this movie. Gibson does an outstanding job directing and the final product does the story so much justice. Hacksaw Ridge ranks with the best war movies such as Saving Private Ryan and Platoon.The first half tells the story about how he came to the decision not to ever hold a weapon and his conviction to his commitment even though ridiculed, and the second half tells the story of his heroics at war without a weapon, when everyone else has one.I highly recommend the film.

Must see so we don't forget the horrors of war,"This is a great WWII movie and a must see. Until now, Saving Private Ryan, in my opinion, depicted the best WWII battle scene as the soldiers landed on Normandy. I now feel that the atrocities and realism of battle have been perfectly captured by Hacksaw Ridge. A part of this film that is not often captured in other war films is the traumatic reaction that the soldiers experience after battle, subtleties like weeping and shocked or sorrowful expressions even on the faces of the background characters. This along with the graphic nature of the kill scenes moved me emotionally, and I am unable to watch anything violent in nature right now as I have had my fill of human suffering for awhile. I think all high school students should watch this movie as a reminder that there was a time when 18 year old young adults were brave and self-sacrificing, a time before the self-absorbed, compliment-fishing selfie. After the movie ended, the audience clapped which is a rarity today. This film will stick with you, and perhaps you will have a conversation with yourself regarding the necessity of war.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Sometimes people see violence and not feel a thing because they are used to watching it their whole life. But due to the very realistic acting, graphics & professional directing i felt very sad during war scenes.

Passion of a soldier,"You can see a parallel with another feature made by Mel Gibson: PASSION OF THE Christ. Instead of Jesus, it is a soldier who is against violence and loves the human kind. You can't hate this movie which is the most powerful, bloody and brutal war movie ever made. A film besides which PRIVATE RYAN look like a Disneyland walk. Yes folks, a terrific piece of work. But... I highly prefer the two Clint Eastwood features from 2006 and 2007: FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS and LETTERS FROM IWI JIMA. If you permit, I will explain why. Unlike Clint, who is the king of Hollywood, Mel Gibson must be very careful if he wants to get back into the industry through the main gate after ten years of ostracism because his behavior with booze and antisemitism talks. He can't make a film, a war movie, showing the American Army the same way Eastwood did. If you remember closely the 2006 and 2007 movies, they were not movies glorifying the GI's. Here, in the Gibson film, you see GIs killing Japanese soldiers who surrender, yes, but Japanese soldiers who also throw a hand grenade on the GIs. And in LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, the GIs killed the Japs in cold blood, poor Jap soldiers without hand grenades... See what I mean? Clint Eastwood showed less bloody combat scenes, yes, but was closer to reality concerning the rest. There were not movies like this one which shows the war in its most terrifying and disgusting side, but on the other side, glorifies heroism. That disturbs me. You can't say to audiences war is bad and also say that heroism is good.No, that's a very powerful movie, only a dumb could say the contrary, but I prefer the Eastwood two films and Sam Peckinpah's CROSS OF IRON. I persist and sign, I am dead sure that Gibson wants to get back into business and, why not, grabbing an Academy Awards and then proceed, resume his career with his VIKINGS film. That's my own opinion.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

All so predictable and boring that I felt I could spend the last hour on more interesting things.I don't have much of an opinion on Mel Gibson.

Let all see it,"So much has been written and said of this film that anything more from me would be insignificant. Since its release I have looked at the Budget and been closely looking at earnings thus far (as I thought that initially it was unjustifiably weak) subsequently I wanted to see earnings break-even with Budget and go beyond to make sufficient money to do justice to the noble contribution the long list of about 35 producers. Following that its my humble suggestion to Mr. Mel Gibson and the producers that this film be made available free for viewing through channels like Netflix, Hulu, iTunes and so on, such that as many people as possible around the world see it and benefit from the message this amazing film carries. Also I suggest the film be dubbed in as many languages in the best way possible to be viewed by a wider audience world over. Oh & I mean Dubbed not subtitled as I find subtitles painfully difficult to catch-up with as they are a big distraction from the narration of any film. My suggestion is based on the fact that during 70's & 80's in India one film maker the respected Mr. Manoj Kumar used to make patriotic and social issues based films for whom the Govt of India would waive off the taxes so that as many people as possible can see the films and benefit from them.

By far the best infantry WWII movie ever,"Wow! I can't say enough about this movie and how well it was done. Mel Gibson managed to tell this true story in the best way it could have been told, with superb direction (and I can be easily critical of direction), superb cinematography, great acting, and a good story board.The battle for Okinawa was brutal. Over 100,000 died in that action. The Japanese soldiers were overwhelming at times, and ruthless in their battle action. Tens of thousands of American soldiers died there. It is wonderful that the action and story of Desmond Doss has been brought to the surface and exposed to millions. He was a true hero.If you can tolerate the brutality of war, shown in a very realistic way, then the rest of this movie will be amazing for you to watch. I am a big WWII movie fan (of which there are many hundreds if not thousands). I tend to mostly enjoy the movies that involve equipment and machines, but for an infantry based movie this one simply can not be beat. It's a 10 on my list and I don't give out many 10s.I know Spielberg has made many popular movies including Saving Private Ryan which is exactly in the same genre as Hacksaw Ridge, but I almost always find something lacking in Spielberg's productions (Schindler's List being the one exception). Not so here in Mel Gibson's project which sets a new bar for direction. It is as real as it gets.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
There is no limit of the human courage.,"Mel Gibson had been criticized by the press so bad, and still he prove that he is a brilliant director. I believe that this film is and will be his ""perl"".Nowadays the war films becomes more like an action movies, especially these ones that are fictional. They are more concentrated in special effects and are less focused on the story. Hacksaw Ridge prove that professional movie making is still alive. It proves that the story and the feelings it gives are and always will be more important that the actual effects. This movie shows the horror of the war, and it show it as close as possible it can be.Andrew Garfield without a doubt was the perfect choice for this act. He did absolutely flawlessly. His talent is way way better developed than his act in spider-man and if he continue in that way he will get recognition on award season.The supporting cast was good too, but their roles are just that ...supportive and they did it well.It's still only January and Gibson raise the bar so high that i doubt some one will make better war movie, or even movie that touch your hearth like he did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"My Favorite Superhero, No Webslinging Necessary","This is what Spider-Man should have been all this time. Here is what Ben Affleck should have done with Batman. Here is a true hero that outshines anyone wearing a colorful, shiny million dollar suit. In fact, all he has to suit him up and protect him from death is the holy word of God. He won't even dream of laying either an eye or a finger on a rifle. If today's superheroes can't help us through gun control, then this real-life hero of Hacksaw Ridge can.Just the first opening sequence alone is enough to tear your heart open and make a home there. Images of the battle on Hacksaw Ridge show the brutality of the historical event: there are more corpses than living souls, rats have arrived to feast off the remains, blowtorches incinerate whoever is left alive, and the heavy-handed music reminds you of what each soldier had to leave to fight for the important things.The story kicks off in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, where one boy goes too far in a fist-fight with his brother, nearly killing him with a brick to the forehead. Reminded of the antiviolence account of Cain and Abel, Desmond Doss feels immediate remorse for what he committed against his brother, and vows never to get involved with violence again.At a much older age, Desmond finds love with a local nurse who has seen soldiers return from World War II. Their romance from here is as sweet and believable as any man would remember his first relationship, complete with a blue jay feather to represent the delicacy of their love. It seems here like director Mel Gibson is returning to his old bags of tricks with the romantic plot of Braveheart, but the vulnerable Church-boy accent by main actor Andrew Garfield wins over both men and women.These small personal touches set up exactly why we should care about the tragic events that happen later, proving exactly what Gibson most succeeds at as a director. He's not even afraid to put in some comic relief when it's time for Desmond to join the army, where one of the first soldiers he meets is a narcissistic bodybuilder who loves exercising in the nude (except when it's time for training). But once he opens up at Fort Jackson about being a pacifist, everything stops being funny. He won't even tie a noose knot without it coming out shaped more like a heart. The rest of the army found it completely unthinkable that a soldier was enlisting with no ambition to even touch a gun, so what happens from here is a multitude of mixed emotions and unclear answers.Hacksaw Ridge may seem at first like the typical war movie that resorts to the usual tropes, but experiencing the film proves how it does everything a gigantic leap further from the clichés. The drill sergeant, along with firing out his expected racist insults, also shows his compassionate side when necessary, and the war hero is not depicted as being purely in the right. Rather, he has one thing that's getting in the way of him serving graciously on the battlefield: his pride in his pacifism.That is why on the day of the first battle at Okinawa, it takes a chaotic series of uncomfortably long warfare segments to put this man of God to the test. This recreation of real events show us how this underestimated unarmed soldier saved hundreds of lives just by sticking to the word of God. You'll be surprised even by how he treats the ""enemy"" that the army is sent to Hacksaw Ridge to destroy.It's not every day a movie like this comes around: a movie that tells one of the most inspiring true stories to come out of the darkest period of man's history. While everyone else in this nation is concerned about unreliable self-righteous heroes like Batman, Superman, Captain America, Spider-Man, here is a hero who knows the importance of putting other lives ahead of his own, committing his service to unconditional love rather than destruction. Therefore, I encourage the instant-classic Hacksaw Ridge as immediate viewing to all, for the sake of our country and our definition of heroism.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Angel,"First of all, I love Mel Gibson as a director. Not as a celebrity or as a wife-beater, but as an artist. Two of his films, Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ, have both become instant favorites of mine. It's been 10 years since his last film, Apocalypto (which I haven't seen yet). When I heard he made a new film, I was hooked immediately. I suppose the main reason I love Gibson's directing style is because he gets really intimate with the content and characters of his films, close-ups and all. When I saw Hacksaw Ridge in a nearly-empty theater, my expectations were exceeded. The intensity of the battle scenes, and I cannot believe I'm saying this, rival those of Saving Private Ryan. During those scenes, the whole theater rumbled like an earthquake with the sounds of gunshots, flying bullets, mortars, grenades, and earth- shattering explosions. The gore was not in the least bit hidden or sugar coated. There was blood, bones, and limbless bodies galore! Because that's the way the Battle of Okinawa really was. Surprisingly, I wouldn't call the violence gratuitous but I know that other people would. Even casted B-movie actors Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington couldn't bring this film down. The only thing that I genuinely condemn about the movie was the portrayal of the Japanese soldiers, who were portrayed as a mix of savages and zombies. It's definitely an American propaganda film, but even so, I'm giving it a 10/10 RATING.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Brutal Mel Gibson Is Back,"If you are reading this review you have probably seen The Passion of the Christ (2004) or at least heard of it and the controversy it stirred over the gruesome brutality Mel Gibson unabashedly portrays on screen. For obvious reasons, the film could not wear the ""true story"" badge that, 12 years later, Hacksaw Ridge (2016) proudly does. This time, Gibson takes his Christ to World War II to tell the modern-day miracle of American corporal Desmond Doss, a religious and peaceful young man who despite his refusal to bear arms or commit any act of violence, saves the lives of 75 soldiers in his division during the Battle of Okinawa.The film features an incredibly diverse cast; Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington, Rachel Griffiths, Luke Bracey and Vince Vaughn, all pushed to limits I never thought they would reach. Who would have thought that the sweet boy-next-door Peter Parker has been carrying so much unnoticed potential? He may not look like the real Desmond Doss at all, but his innocently childish face renders the purity of Doss's character, and his emotionally fierce performance conveys the vigor of his faith. However, the person whose presence is felt the most during the 140-minute-long movie is Mr. Gibson himself; his brutal and raw energy becomes the moving force behind every single shot. While watching the film, I caught myself unconsciously clenching my body in a fetus position as a way to fend off the violence on the screen. Gibson's violence is not the gory slaughterhouse kind that invests in feelings of disgust (that never gets me anyway); it is violence that brings our physical and human vulnerability to unprecedented proximity – he brutally invades the bubble of our reality to bring our insides out for everyone to see meaningless, absurd, and vicious as they are.Although it has been described as a ""religious bomb,"" the way I see it, Hacksaw Ridge preaches faith not religion. I am well aware that Mel Gibson is an extremely religious individual, and I mean it dogmatically and aesthetically. Like it or not, you've got to respect him for his discipline as a director and his courageous indifference to Hollywood standards. In a time where miracles are ridiculed and our sole idea of heroes is sexy bodies in spandex suits whose superpowers are measured by how much damage they can inflict, Gibson shows us a real hero whose only superpower was his faith – a real hero who only wanted to save lives all lives!For those who could not understand his message the first time, Gibson is saying it again, louder and in a much more mature voice: we need to jump into the very heart of violence to really understand the powerful nature of love.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
If this story is true its extraordinary...,"I had big expectations from this movie and I have to say that it is really special. I knew that it would be violent as it was directed by Mel Gibson but the slow romantic warm up made me forget all about it. And that's why I think it is brilliant. It will just shock you and blow your mind when you ""experience"" war through this movie. It's almost insane. I have seen many war movies but this one is far the most realistic one. I also loved the fact that it is not trying to create cheap emotions but it stays real yet manages to be very powerful. It is definitely one of the best movies this year. It also has a very nice clear picture quality which should be definitely rewarded with an Oscar. If nothing else I at least hope Mel Gibson will direct more movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Best Movie of 2016,"In a year of many disappointing sequels, spin-offs, and reboots, Mel Gibson has come out of hiding to save the cinematic year with Hacksaw Ridge. I can honestly say that the only war movie that comes close to this one's quality and realism is Saving Private Ryan. Realistic, gripping, and even humorous at times, Hacksaw Ridge is filled with beautiful cinematography and scenery, and great acting, particularly from Garfield, Vaughn, and Weaving. Garfield should certainly be nominated for Best Actor, and both Vaughn and Weaving could potentially win in the Best Supporting Actor category. The film also tackles controversial and heavy themes admirably, and doesn't pander to its audience, which I appreciate. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that it ends somewhat abruptly. I urge you to check out this cinematic achievement, and I certainly hope it wins big at the Oscars this year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A brutal look at the true cost of being a conscientious objector during war.,"For many years, Mel Gibson has been at the center of controversies and other unwelcome attention-grabbing incidents. While this normally kills any actor's chances of reviving their careers, Gibson has instead managed to remain somewhat unscathed by retreating into his other skill: directing. As we've seen from some of his other directorial efforts, he is skilled behind the lens, even if many themes remain the same. From Braveheart (1995) to The Passion of the Christ (2004), Gibson has a tendency to be pretty brutal in the imagery he brings to the screen. Granted, this is partly due to the semi-factual source material.In his latest work after a long hiatus, Gibson brings us the brutality that is World War II. Hacksaw Ridge takes some time to get to its emotional center, but the unfortunate side effect of this is a series of characters that feel almost comical in their exaggerations. From Andrew Garfield's goofily grinning Desmond T. Doss to Hugo Weaving's alcoholic Tom Doss, the reality of war easily sets in once Desmond is allowed to deploy to the Pacific theatre and ""fight"" with his fellow man, attempting to do what no one else is willing to: save more lives than he ends.The brutality of Hacksaw Ridge is clearly portrayed by Gibson's directing, most of the time being a bit over the top. Partly because everything in this film seemed overly exaggerated, it's almost hard to take it very seriously. Sure, the religious themes intertwined with the duty of going to war were an interesting combination and the real-life story of this human savior was inspiring; but at the end of the day, the other aspects of the film seemed to lessen these impacts.A brutal look at the true cost of being a conscientious objector during war, I give Hacksaw Ridge 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A war film smothered between thick coatings of religious rhetoric....,"I came to Hacksaw Ridge hoping for an interesting and realistic portrayal of the life of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector, who saved the lives of countless battlefield wounded, as a medic.What you get instead is saccharine, hero stick, smothered beneath thick coatings of religious rhetoric. Its painful stuff, that had me squirming in my seat within the first five minutes of the film's opening scenes.Just as bothersome is the assumption its ""OK"" to be a behave like a nihilistic, cruel drunk (the father character) because ""hey, he served in the war"". This is such a common excuse, in US made war films and television that really does not hold up to close scrutiny.The war scenes in this film are well shot (it does come with a huge budget) and the acting is of a good caliber. That said, there's little of substance on offer here, aside from romanticizing brutal and awful events, that, in my mind, deserve a more somber, down to earth treatment.Four out of ten from me.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A great movie about a hero who saved a lot of people without using a gun.,"Hacksaw Ridge is yet another proof that Mel Gibson is a great director, Hacksaw Ridge is top 5 best war movies of that century, the movie resembles quite Full Metal Jacket from Stanley Kubrick, who has 2 act, totally different, the first shows the Doss's life, his relationship with his family, his training and his passion for the doctor Dorothy, Andrew Garfield makes perhaps his best acting career (I have not yet watched Silence), it impressed me, I always found him a middle-aged actor, Vince Vaugh is very well, Teresa Palmer, Sam Worthington, Luce Bracey, Hugh Weaving and etc, the rest of the cast is very competent, the script unfortunately is not perfect, has many problems, has very dialogues Mel Gibson bloody portrays the horror of the war, and he is very good at doing it (Braveheart is proof of this, blood battles and Very well done), the soundtrack is good, the rhythm is very good, it has incredible scenes, I really enjoyed the final scene, and the construction of Desmond in the movie is great, Hacksaw Ridge is undoubtedly one of the best Oscar movies, and If winning will not be unfair, Mel Gibson has to make more war movie.

A Different (And Much-Needed) Kind Of War Movie,"War is usually synonymous with death and loss...especially at the movies. Stories abound about individuals ""doing what needs to be done"", which usually involves quite violent, brutal acts in the name of country and duty. There is nothing wrong with those types of movies (as war truly is Hell), but Mel Gibson proves in ""Hacksaw Ridge"" that the story of war can also include men of peace.For a basic plot summary, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" tells the story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), a young man who volunteers to serve in WWII. He faces once pretty severe obstacle, however...the fact that he will not pick up a weapon (a combination of being a 7th Day Adventist and some past childhood experiences). After a fight just to be allowed to serve, Doss finally joins up as a medic on Okinawa, participating in the brutal ""Hacksaw Ridge"" campaign. Without a weapon of any kind, Doss continually runs into battle to save as many men as possible.There is just something about the story of Desmond Doss that will resonate with most audiences. He had a battle just to serve, then a more literal battle in Okinawa. You have to respect an individual who manages to serve his country but still remain true to his own personal beliefs. Doss walks a fine line, to be sure, but his courage and fortitude stand out in the end.It helps that Andrew Garfield is basically perfect casting for this type of film. Once Garfield stops screwing around with teen/Spidey roles, I could see him really establishing a serious acting presence. He combines boyish innocence with stern resolve (when needed).Another thing to note about ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is that, much like Gibson's earlier ""Passion of the Christ"", the violence of the real world isn't shied away from whatsoever. The war scenes here are brutal, but aren't overdone. In fact, I felt like the movie did a better job than perhaps any I've ever seen of portraying the sheer terror of the battlefield. I was legitimately unsettled on a number of occasions.Perhaps the highest praise I can give to ""Hacksaw Ridge"", however, is that by the end I was trying to hold back tears...and not succeeding. Doss's story is such an emotional one, and is portrayed perfectly as such, that it excellently stirs emotions. It's a story that needed to be told, and director Gibson was more than up to the task.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Please God help bring one more...,"There is something unexplainable about seeing a person save another person's life, and No I don't mean seeing superman save the world or another generic hero save a child from a burning building. I'm talking about seeing a person, a real, living, breathing person save a life... Ever watched those YouTube videos of security cameras showing you how someone saved another person from death. It's a heart warming site that often leaves you tearing for a reason so hard to explain... Maybe it reminds us of how great we can actually be... Maybe it restores some of our faith in humanity. Either way, this film gives you this strange cathartic feeling.Desmond Doss is a man of principle and virtue, and whether one agrees with his principles or not, it is impossible not to respect him for his commitment to those principles. This is what makes Desmond so real and relatable, his beliefs, his judgment, his own commitment to avoid any regretful action, and in his case it's the act of violence. Desmond shows the essence of purpose that most people feel is necessity in life. "" Please God, help me bring one more...""I don't usually discuss directing in my reviews, but it would be extremely unfair in this case. Mel Gibson is mostly known for his way of showing excessive blood and gore. While that is true, it is not what he does best in my opinion. What he does best is his showcasing of Valor and Bravery in a character. I have not seen any director that does it better. Desmond like William Wallace in Braveheart (1994) has that kind baffling bravery that leaves a mark in the viewer.The War was shown in a very realistic way and straight from eyes of soldiers, ONLY the soldiers. There are no sequences of how the chain of command works for them to end up on Hacksaw Ridge. There are no sequences that even show the person on the ship, receiving coordinates. We only see the world from the eyes of these soldiers, specifically the POV Prvt. Doss. The chaos, the fear, the shock, the tears, the shattered hopes, and literally the shattered soldiers were all seen straight from the eyes of soldiers. I have to say, this is one of the most engaging, heart felt films I've ever seen.Highly recommended",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""My way to serve""","This movie is the story of Desmond Doss, an American army medic who was a hero at the battle of Okinawa. This enjoyable, profound and well-crafted movie not only tells a great story, but also has important life lessons about war, courage, sacrifice,leadership, character and conviction.We should be grateful that a movie like this can still be made in 2016. That there are still writers, directors and producers able and willing to do this. We're no longer used to going to films that hold out characters as role models. Yes, there is a religious element to it. But I'm not religious at all, and I felt the religious aspects of this were sensitively handled and not too overt.I don't think it's inappropriate to be reminded now and again that we were once in a life-and-death struggle with some of our current allies. It is shocking now to see the intensity of it in one realistic battle scene after the other. Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illisWhat I didn't like about this film: (1) The recruit training scenes were not 100% realistic to me. (2) The director made it seem like Doss's c.o. status was unusual and affront to his officers, but of course they must have had a system for dealing with this not uncommon situation. (3) The battlefield carnage may be too realistic to some. (4) The Japanese side was not developed in any way, and I think they were almost caricaturized.If you have children who can handle battlefield carnage, take them to see this inspiring film. Are there still young people of conviction out there? Is Mel Gibson's Desmond Doss a realistic role model for our jaded times? I think Andrew Garfield played the role well, and is someone that young people can identify with today.I'm sure some people are going to be uncomfortable with seeing a movie like this made by a director who is wrongly perceived as a dumb*ss beefcake actor and as conservative, ultra-religious and racist. And yet regardless of what you believe about Gibson, there is no doubt that the man is a gifted craftsman. He is a great director who makes mind-blowing movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Gibson gets the job done in his first English language film since BRAVEHEART,"Mel Gibson returns with HACKSAW RIDGE. It tells the true story of Desmond Doss, a man who refused to even touch a weapon, who despite this, volunteered to serve as a medic in WWII and saved the lives of 75 to 100 men at Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa, Japan. He won the medal of honor and the deep respect of all his brothers in arms. It's a very moving and inspiring story, perfectly tailored to the sensibilities of Gibson as a filmmaker. In this film, He revisits the themes that we have come to know in each of his works. As with Braveheart, and Passion before it, HACKSAW RIDGE is a sacrificial love story. One man's love is tested and perfected through great suffering. Through the violence he finds redemption...Its obvious Mel Gibson is trying to reach that same audience that responded so strongly to The Passion. The violence is there, the biblical imagery is there, the higher spiritual plane is there, it's all there. Yet even though it gets the job done, it is certainly not a flawless film and doesn't quite reach the artistic peaks of his last two efforts...My biggest issue with this movie is how it doesn't try to break the mold with the characterizations. All of Desmond's fellow soldiers are stock characters. You have the funny drill sergeant. The guy with the New York accent. The guy with the funny nickname. You never really get to know these characters. They're just cliches. Another thing was with the war scenes, which are actually the highlight of the film. Yet, stylistically, it's admittedly a little strange with all the guys constantly flying through the air, i'ts a little over the top. Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers were prime examples of gritty, realistic, and involving WW2 films. And they had real characters with nuance and personality. Hacksaw Ridge is an inspiring true story with some brutal and well-directed war sequences, but with a lot of cliches. Now even though the movie works within the confines of conventions we've seen, it still manages to move you, which is what matters most. So overall I recommend it. I would've liked a little more grit and nuance with the characters but I Think with the audience they were trying to reach, the choices they made are somewhat understandable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Great World War 2 movie,"""Hacksaw Ridge"" is an extremely realistic and well-made World War 2 movie.

Vince Vaughn is a convincingly tough Army sergeant. The battle field scenes are horrific and brutal. It is incredible that our fathers and grandfathers went through such horrors. Mr. Gibson brings it all back with a great directing touch and outstanding cinematography. As an Army veteran, I wanted to see the movie.

9/10 Please God let me save one more ...,"Brilliant.Make love not war .""In peace sons bury their fathers , in war fathers bury their sons""Not the film I was expecting at all . Having purposely not read reviews beforehand I was expecting a Hollywood war film saying we are American we are great and promoting the glory of war , glossing over alleged war crimes by the allies and just showing the enemy as evil without any balance portraying their enormous losses of some 100,000 Japanese soldiers killed and half the civilian population of 300,000 died as opposed to 20,000 losses on the allied side in total during the three month battle for Okinawa. So I was not expecting to enjoy the film at all and the opening scene confirmed my fear.However from then on the film took completely different twist. It was a Very sympathetic moral personal journey of the main protagonist sympathetically played by Andrew Garfield . Excellent supporting cast particularly Hugo Weaving as the father .You grow to really admire Private Doss as do his colleagues eventually , his undoubted heroism shows that there is more than one way to be patriotic . I'm not going to go into more detail so as not spoil the plot but will just say this is a blood and guts war film for people who do not like war films as well as a war film for those who like action with a romantic twist to boot.The set of Maeda escarpment was excellent and cinematography revolutionary in terms of Its realism and with some irony was similar to the battlefield of Gallipoli , a film that starred Mel Gibson the excellent director of Hacksaw Ridge .The best three films of 2017 so far have ALL been based on true stories LION , SULLY and HACKSAW RIDGEIf like me you were thinking this wasn't your sort of film don't hesitate , go see it , only two films have surpassed this in 2017 and none of them were Lalaland !",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Triumph of Spirit,"Battle depictions are always going to be gut crunching & emotionally disturbing whilst there is always that calm soothing subject to keep the platoon sewed, well this time it's in form of a godly medic in the Battle of Okinawa in 1945 WWII. The incredible true story of Corporal Desmond Doss is genuinely heart wrecking and has been captured aesthetically on the big screen right from his uncustomary childhood to his admission into the B-Company breezing through a rather-fascinatingly presented love life. Mr Director strikes the right chord while sailing past the humanistic approach to ""hell of a battle"" churning out the triumphant as Spirit of an individual. Aptly titled as HACKSAW RIDGE, it's been supremely uplifted by it's cast & crew probably making it the Best Movie of 2016, even from the technical front.

I think I'll pass.,"It's truly maddening that IMDb's rules demand a minimum of one star to be awarded to any movie; there should be a special clause put in place, just for over-hyped monstrosities like Hacksaw Ridge. Safe to say, if I were given the chance, I wouldn't be gracing this ode to racism and gender inequality snuff movie with one iota of a merit.So many things have gone wrong here that I think there is a need for a whole new set of words invented to accurately describe it. Of course, knowing the director, this has probably been a pretty accurate depiction of his directorial vision and overall cosmotheory. No words -- but in rage, I'll still try.A droll, all-American, penis-waving, religious propaganda failing on so many levels -- and so many levels past, that you could quite realistically read any random negative review on it and you'll know exactly how I feel.

Heroes in spandex need not apply,"If there is one thing I could take away from this movie it is to beware of criticizing people different from your beliefs and values. The very values they embrace (and which you criticize), may one day save your life.Growing up in the Adventist culture I met Desmond twice, once at a youth retreat, and another time I had lunch with him and family. They (Doss, wife, and son) were in a hospital cafeteria. They were sitting at a table for four and I asked if I could join them. They were more than happy for me to sit with them. I didn't recognize him at first, but his wife let me know who he was :)He was a very gracious and quiet man. He did his duty without hesitation or regard for his own safety or an iota of self-interest. His courage and commitment to duty far outweighed any gun he might have holstered. The fact he was never killed in the line of duty is a miracle. The many, many lives he saved, amazingly even more so.The part that got me the most in the film was when he started sending men down the escarpment in his (unofficial) double bowline custom knot. The soldiers watching didn't know what was going on, then they realized it was ""Doss, the coward"". No greater love hath a man that lays down his life for his friends - such act speaks louder and stronger than any sermon or speech given by politician or preacher. It transcends religion or ideology.

"Welcome back, Mel","Mel Gibson returns to the director's chair with this war epic based on the true life story of Private Desmond Doss, who served in the Army as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa during World War ll...he also happened to be a pacifist, someone unwilling to partake in violence due to his religious beliefs, which there is plenty of in the climate of war therefore facing tremense odds not in his favor, more so than the men who carry their weapons into battle. I've been a big fan of Mel Gibson's work despite the lows of his career, and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is no exception. One of the biggest strengths of Mel Gibson's direction is that he doesn't shy away from depicting violence in his films, and with this film he shouldn't, war is one of if not the ugliest thing to exist in the history of mankind, war SHOULD be gory, it SHOULD feel like you're watching a horror movie. Andrew Garfield is very good as Private Desmond Doss, he perfectly portrayed the good hearted nature of his character, and his accent for the most part wasn't too distracting, the film also stars Hugo Weaving, Teresa Palmer, Vince Vaughn, and Sam Worthington, they too give very good performances in the movie, but most surprisingly of all we also see ""Point Break"" remake star Luke Bracey EASILY giving the best performance of his young career. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a roaring return for Mel Gibson in the director's chair, masterfully delivering this brutal yet uplifting tale of one man's battle against the tremendous odds stacked against him and his brothers in arms.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hacksaw Ridge - Movie Review,"LIFF30 2016 #3""In peace, sons bury their fathers. In war, fathers bury their sons"".Hacksaw Ridge may seem like another Oscar bait ""true story"" biopic that we get every couple of years. The trailers didn't help at all, as it made the film look corny and very award bait. But guys trust on this, it's nothing like that. There's nothing glamorous about this. When it was over, I left was speechless. This is such a great movie.Say what you want about Mel Gibson controversial past and behavior, but I think we must judge the art, not the artist. This guy is an excellent director and a great actor. And you have no idea how glad I am seeing Mel back, as he is the most talented man in Hollywood right now. The most impressive part of Mel's directing in this movie (besides the battle scenes), is he's decision of an old version approach to the film making. The movie literally looks and feels like it was made around the 50's. Also how Gibson would let actors deliver the emotion of what their feeling and it could meant a lot of things that isn't just terrified. It could be happy, regret, or just thinking of home. And I got all of that.Andrew Garfield is an actor that's been non-stop blowing me away recently. And he gives one hell of performance as Desmond Doss. I would say it's one of his best since ""The Social Network"". Even in the battle scenes I thought he was brilliant, as he had this scared, tired, but brave look to him. He's accent in the film I thought worked pretty well and wasn't distracting like I thought it would. The chemistry between Garfield and Teresa Palmer was so charming and sweet that it didn't came of too corny.Hugo Weaving plays Desmond father in the movie and he was outstanding. Such a powerful and emotional heavy performance. Weaving is the type of actor that deserves so much respect. I mean, we all know him as Agent Smith, V, Megatron, Elrond, and Red Skull. But for him to give a small supporting performance as the alcoholic father who's dealing with conflicted within was quite moving.Vince Vaughn was so good in this movie that I wish he would come back for dramatic roles, as I really did brought his performance in this. The comedic one lines were pure gold and it was very ""Full Metal Jacket"". But he isn't like that the whole movie. When he's serious in the movie, it actually works and doesn't feel out of place for the rest of the tone.Now the battle scenes in the movie...wow, it's pretty rough and disturbing. It's right up there with ""Saving Private Ryan"" for graphic and shocking depictions. What I always love in these type of War films is the loud sound, actors, and the camera work, which this movie nails at. I've heard some people say that the movie glorify's it's violence despite the theme of the movie being against violence. I honestly think these people have really missed the point here. All the battle scenes are depicted more as this horrible event than a flawless victory.After the movie was over, everyone in the cinema started clapping. The last time that happened was when in saw ""Up"" back in 2009. While I never saw the point of clapping or booing at a movie, but for this occasion, I'll let it Slide. The ending was a very nice touch and pretty heartfelt to honor the soldiers that fought in the war. It was deserved.I haven't got a lot of issues with the movie. But if had to pick, I would probably say that Sam Worthington Australia accent kept slipping in and out in a few scenes. And don't get me wrong, Worthington isn't bad in the movie, but he was pretty good. The same can go to some of cast (as most of them are Australia), but I can easily look past it as the actual performances were all great.Overall rating: ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is not perfect, but it positives really do weigh out it's flaws. It's the best War movie I've seen in awhile in terms of it's execution and pay off.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Gibson is back,"Gibson is back. And gave the world a new violent reli-movie. If you like to see all Hollywood cliché: go see this one. More white people fighting foreign people! More suffering! This time on a cartoon battlefield with rats on every body, people flying around everywhere and more goofy horror-style gore. In the end, Christianity will win over those savages.I'm not even looking at the plot holes, the historical falsifications and the military fairy tale that's being shown here. Really, just one rope ladder for the whole invasion? And the Japs didn't cut it loose?The most scary thing is that it seems like the majority of the people take this film VERY serious. It even got nominated for six Oscars, praised here in IMDb as the best, realistic war movie ever. Let me tell you: it's not. It's a new genre movie, especially made for white males with a narrow and religious view on the real world and it's history.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Could be the best war film since Saving Private Ryan,"It's been a long hard road back, but with Hacksaw Ridge the long ridiculed and often ostracised Mel Gibson has once more announced himself to the movie world with a unique and affecting war film that is arguably the best of its kind since Saving Private Ryan stormed the beaches in 1998.In the process of his fight back to redemption, Gibson who has long been a powerful storyteller, has also created one of the most fully formed and impressive Australian films of all time with Hacksaw Ridge providing us with an impressive and on form cast, a stunningly captured film that features some of the most intense battle scenes conducted on film and a real life central figure that well and truly deserves the airtime he gets in this movie.More than likely inspired by his own faiths and beliefs, Gibson has in the story of war medic Desmond Doss (played here by Andrew Garfield, in the best form his been in since his breakthrough Boy A), a man who refused against all the odds to hold a weapon during the war thanks to his firm stance against taking a human life, found a character that brings out the best in the filmmaker and with a strong initial set up of Doss, followed by a gruelling time at boot camp and a blood filled campaign in Okinawa that provides this war epic with a heart and soul that makes it an experience that can be enthralling for viewers of all shapes and sizes.The enthralling nature of Hacksaw Ridge stems from its focus on not being a simple war story, it's all at once an affecting tale of love, an examination of one's stance to remain true to what they believe in and an ear shattering, nerve rattling depiction of war and while the middle section of Gibson's film lingers on slightly too long and a repetitive nature of events threatens to derail the tales great opening and incoming spectacle, Gibson and his troops that includes an awards worthy supporting turn from Huge Weaving as Doss's alcoholic father, Vince Vaughan's likable army sergeant and another turn from Teresa Palmer that suggests she's very much verging on becoming Australia's next big thing, make sure that Hacksaw Ridge never allows itself to dip below anything but a fantastic overall production.It's not for the faint of heart and many may find the war scenes within Hacksaw Ridge to authentic to bear but this is a film that showcases many of the best elements of Gibson as a filmmaker and in telling a worthy real life story, Gibson has announced himself once more to an industry that could've easily been done with him and this impressive film is a likely contender at the upcoming awards season, bringing about the recognition that Gibson's past failings have once and for all been forgotten about.4 rope burns out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Gibson doesn't Hack On Hacksaw Ridge,"American entertainment, most of us know it's all about the extremes these days (extreme crudeness, extreme drama, extreme stupidity). Well tonight an extreme director, Mel Gibson, takes a shot at making a movie that might defy the simplistic trend of most cinema is today. Tonight a buddy and I hit the theaters to check out Hacksaw Ridge, a war drama that pegs the life of a rare officer position (the combat medic). Will this interesting spin fit well in the library of battle based films, or has Gibson gone off the deep end. Let's get goingLIKES:  Action Packed  Balances faith with honor  Inspirational  Fantastic effects  Good charactersYeah, I have a lot of likes and it starts with the action this movie has to offer. Hacksaw Ridge can be described as the pacific campaign of Saving Private Ryan, with plenty of explosions, bullets, and flamethrowers to light up the silver screen. You'll be cringing as all hell breaks loose in high definition sound and incredible special (not cheesy) effects that will drag you into the depths of battle. You might find yourself at the edge of your seat watching your hero tear through the scarred land, jumping through the carnage to take down a bunker. Like realistic portrayals of war, this is the film for you. But Hacksaw ridge isn't just about soldiers getting dismembered or barbecued. No it's a tale meant to inspire people to believe in their values, defy the odds, and yes help people without killing them. Gibson and his team have designed emotionally packed scenes where the cinematography alongside the stunning orchestral work bestows the honor of our soldiers. The dialogue also preaches the message Doss' story is designed to tell, much of which involves faith being tested against tradition. Sometimes it got a bit cheesy with the blatant, overdramatic deliveries, but it fit so well into the film it really didn't faze me. Regardless, both patriots and religious zealots will love the balance of faith with duty, and have a character you latch onto. As for the cast, well Hacksaw Ridge has a little something for everyone to latch onto. Doss is the picture of a perfect, good spirited southerner, complete with hick like accent (thank you Hollywood stereotype). His morals, loyalty, determination, and overall nice guy attitude are qualities that many will find endearing. Too much of a good two shoes? Well then go for the gung ho Yankee who wields a gun like Rambo named Smitty. His character is all about the action, the adrenaline, and the war hero pride you love to see in these epics. Still too serious, then throw in Vince Vaughn as a sergeant who has action, comedy, and a bit of compassion to round out the cast. The company has strong heroes to lead the charge, amidst the extras whose names you might forget.DISLIKES:  Slow to take off/A bit rushed  Characters lost in the carnageHard to find fault in this movie, as Gibson and company did so well making this epic war drama. However, there were a few things my buddy and I found a little limiting. The main thing was how long it took the movie to take off. Sure we have to have an origin story and build up how are character had his coming to Jesus moment (a rogue brick to his brother's head). Despite how good they did with this, it doesn't help that it took a while for Hacksaw Ridge to take off. The first thirty minutes in particular are rushed relationships with his parents and girl, which although establishes Doss' life, drags at times as you wait for the training to begin. In addition, some of these arks get dropped into the background, left to simmer until the ending when the campaign is over. This was especially true for some of the soldiers, who after a five-minute introduction are dropped into a sea of extras almost never to be seen again. Doss and a few other troop members will get much of the screen time, while others will stand out only by looks before violently flopping on the desolate wasteland of the ridge. You would think a little more involvement after taking the time to name them, but no not the case. In addition, some of the romantic and family dynamics are dropped like a bad grenade, only to be tied up at the end of the show. Outside of these small flaws, the only other thing we agreed on was some random additions of Japanese customs, which while accurate was kind of pointless in the grand scheme of things.The VERDICT:Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best modern war movies I've seenperiod. The nice spin on the protagonist being a pacifist drops a whole new light on the war theater and provided a character who was deeper than the barrel of a rifle. Doss' story is certainly inspiring, and it's nice to see a movie where both faith and honor can work in tandem without being dragged out and dull (Unbreakable). Yes it does take time to get stoked, but once the spark ignites, it shines in suspenseful, well-shot delight. Of note, this movie isn't for the faint of heart. Weak constitutions may get sick, or have nightmares depending on how mutilated, bloody bodies affect you (PLEASE DON'T TAKE SMALL KIDS TO SEE THIS FILM). I strongly encourage a theater visit to this movie, perhaps a couple of times if you've got the cash.My scores are:Biography/Drama/Romance: 9.0Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Mel Gibson's testament on war pacifism packs a punch, and not without the grisly portrayal of war","There are very few directors out there who portray the dark side of religion and war as powerfully as Mel Gibson. Looking back at the critically acclaimed 'Braveheart' and the highly controversial 'Passion of The Christ', Gibson's depictions of violence clashing with spirituality has proved to be far more effective than contrived; and this World War II biopic centering on the true story of a soldier driven by his firm spirituality to the take a different path in active combat instead of being a man carrying a gun in the midst of the bloodshed. His path is not to take the lives of others with the use of bullets, but save them. What could have been just your average faith-based drama feeling like a clichéd religious sermon ends up being a powerful testament of war pacifism and a man's challenge against the tyranny that targets his religious ideology. The film tells the true story of Desmond Doss (played by Andrew Garfield), a devout Christian and member of the Seventh-Day Adventist raised by his caring mother Bertha (played by Rachel Griffiths) and abusive alcohol father Tom (played by Hugo Weaving) strained by his experience in World War I. With World War II ravaging, Desmond enlists in the army as a Conscious Objector. During boot camp training, he faces causes displeasure in his drill sergeant (played by Vince Vaughn) when he refuses to touch a gun due to his religious beliefs. But when his platoon is deployed on the battlefield in Okinawa, Japan, Desmond proves to be more worthy as a soldier than many believe when saves over 50 wounded soldiers -- and doesn't even fire a single shot.One of the biggest ironies is how Mel Gibson cohesively makes a case of pacifism through an unflinchingly brutal portrayal of the horrors of war, and the story of how lead character Desmond Doss must face the violent nature of active combat that greatly conflicts with his religious beliefs. The first half of the film introduces Desmond as a young man who embraces his spirituality, while forced to deal with abusive upbringing by his father Tom who feels scarred by his son when he decides along his Howard (Desmond's brother) to enlist in the war, recounting his harrowing experience in World War I that costed the lives of his friends. Along the way, we are then introduced to hot-shot nurse Dorothy (played by Teresa Palmer) who Desmond quickly forms a relationship and provides some sweet moments of levity and connection for Desmond when he out overseas on the battlefields, though the depiction of their romance is a bit hokey and somewhat awkward during the first half-hour. Ultimately, the first hour is primarily about establishing Desmond's pacifism and the cruel nature in which he endures when he makes himself the center of ridicule by his officers and fellow comrades who view of his refusal of abandoning his firmly held conviction against fighting as an act of cowardly, which is gracefully brought together in the boot camp training sequences in the fashion of 'Full Metal Jacket'.Most of Mel Gibson's directing style shines through not only the performance aspect, but the incredibly realistic (and horrifyingly graphic) combat sequences. Shot with quality cinematography by Simon Duggan, the second half pulls viewers into the muggy heat of the Japanese battlefields as we watch the soldiers trudge the muddy fields little with decapitated bodies, dismembered corpses, dead soldiers rotting and getting fed off from rats; and the gruesome scenery firmly sets the tone for some of the most graphic and astoundingly authentic battle sequences since 'Saving Private Ryan'. If you recall the heart-wrenching Omaha Beach invasion in the opening scene, the battle sequences are here feel nothing short of an extension to this. With limbs blown off, bodies disemboweled, and heads torn apart; these combat sequences portray the hellish reality of active combat, and does so without feeling gratuitous or exploitative. Along with Mel Gibson's execution of war are some unexpected surprises that arrive from the performance department. One of which is Andrew Garfield as the lead Desmond Doss in a powerful performance that expands upon his ingenious talent compared to his ill-fated outing in the 'Spiderman' reboot franchise. Vince Vaughn, an actor slowly fading away from his series of dull comedies , delivers an R. Lee Ermey treatment in his role as the ruthless and intimidating drill sergeant. Though a little clumsy in some scenes, he manages pull off the rare feat of escaping into a sincere performance.Hacksaw Ridge is a powerful and deeply gripping testament on its lead subject's war pacifism, and marks a highly admirable directorial return for Mel Gibson. This film is certainly no cinematic landmark in the war genre, but it stands strong as one of the most profound films of the year. If this film manages to garner some Oscar nominations, it shouldn't much of a surprise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

They were very careful about making everything look authentic right down to the buttons on the uniforms. This is the story of a true hero, and I don't want to spoil it for you.

This is how you make a movie,"It's got everything: compelling drama and characters, thrilling action, a moving score. Hacksaw Ridge just works on every level. Granted, I prefer the first half. I happen to find the dramatic aspect of Desmond Doss' journey more interesting; his struggle to maintain his integrity against overwhelming adversity is truly inspiring. Now, I'm not a religious person at all, but you don't need to have faith to stick to your guns. Desmond has a flat arc, which means that he himself changes very little throughout the story, all the while changing everybody else's perception of him and one by one gaining their trust. The action is brutal and realistic and puts you right in the middle of the fight. The humor works just as well, intentional or not. The romance is very sweet and pure, albeit short-lived. I could have watched a whole movie with just the two of them (Desmond & Dorothy) as their chemistry felt very real.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A human story lost among the entrails,"Don't let the fact that ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is about a pacifist fool you: it's just as graphically violent as you'd expect from a war movie directed by Gibson.""The Revenant"" set a new standard with its opening war scene. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" doesn't come close to it. Sure, it's violent, but it's also difficult to follow. So much attention is paid to all the different ways the human body can be destroyed by WWII era weaponry that you forget you're supposed to care about the individual lives being lost. Some of these scenes are so gruesome they approach ridiculousness, such as a soldier picking up the torso of a comrade - whose arms and legs were blown off - and running into battle, using him as a meat-shield.Did I mention this movie is about a pacifist? It doesn't exactly come to the fore, but then, none of the characters do. It's just blood, guts, explosions, death, mayhem.It almost makes you thankful the real Desmond Doss, whose story this is based on, didn't live to see this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Most of these men don't believe the same way you do, but they believe so much in how much you believe.","Hacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and written by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight. It is based on the 2004 documentary The Conscientious Objector. It stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Ryan Corr, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Music is by Rupert Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Simon Duggan.Film is a depiction of the real life heroics of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic in WWII during The Battle of Okinawa.How great to have Gibson back directing, more so when he's tackling the brutalities of war and the critical human interest stories within. The story of Desmond Doss is inspirational stuff and Gibson and his team have done his story proud.First half of the picture details Doss' upbringing, getting to know his family background, his beliefs and the forming of his loving relationship with Dorothy Schutte. Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp, which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle - let alone use one! After the military based political thunder has exhausted its armoury, Doss and the rest of the 77th Infantry Division are sent to Okinawa to try and capture the Maeda Escarpment (Hacksaw Ridge). From where a true legend is born.As is a Gibson trademark, the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be, the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact. Amongst the carnage, which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry, Doss (brilliantly brought to life by Garfield) comes to the fore. From within the madness comes humanity in its purest and most genuine form, and it makes for edge of the seat viewing whilst stirring the blood of those invested fully in this remarkable story. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
So powerful it is tear inducing,"Based on a true story, Hacksaw ridge is the story of a young man with incredible courage and unshakable faith. Having almost killed his brother and his father in two separate incidents Desmond made a pack with God ― thy shall not kill. Not only does he hold to this, he will not touch a firearm. The problem is, WWII has broken out and he has enlisted in the US army. As a Conscientious Objector, Desmond is beaten, harassed and court martialled. Quoting the constitution, his father, a veteran of WWI, convinces the military court to not only re- frame for jailing his son for disobeying a direct order, but to let him fight. Trained as a field medic, Desmond is sent to Japan to help fight the war.The idea that a medic would remaining behind on an horrific battle front swarming with Japanese soldiers who do not give quarter, would seem implausible, if it were not true. Armed with only an unshakable faith in God, Desmond rescues seventy-five men. Not only does he drag them across the front line, but he lowers them down a cliff-face on a rope. Desmond, is the only Conscientious Objector to receive a medal of hour for bravery.The story is well told and moves along at a fast pace. It is however, graphically violent and not for the fainthearted. If you have a strong stomach, this film is so powerful it is tear inducing. It is easily one of the best war films I have seen since Saving Private Ryan. I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The hero movie,"Hacksaw Ridge is not a film for the feint-hearted. Right away the opening scenes portray the horror of war, and the emotional journey is only beginning as the audience is led through the story of war-hero Desmond Doss. Telling the story of Desmond Doss, an Army medic that refused to carry a weapon through the hell fire of battle in Okinawa at the height of World War II. The untold story of Doss is one that is of the finer war hero stories that anyone could tell. This is great movie hero ever.While growing up near Lynchburg, Virginia, a young Desmond Doss nearly kills his younger brother Hal. After that incident, Desmond Doss swear to god, will not kill human. Years later, Doss takes a man injured by a car to the hospital and meets a nurse, Dorothy Schutte. They enter into a relationship and Doss tells her of his desire to do medical work.At the outbreak of World War II, Doss is motivated to enlist in the Army. His father, a troubled World War I veteran, is deeply upset by the decision. Doss intends to serve as a combat medic. Before leaving for Fort Jackson, South Carolina, he asks for Dorothy's hand in marriage and she accepts.Doss is placed under the command of Sergeant Howell. He excels physically but becomes an outcast among his fellow soldiers for refusing to handle a rifle and train on Saturdays. Howell and Captain Glover attempt to discharge Doss for psychiatric reasons but fail.They complete basic training and are released on leave, during which Doss intends to marry Dorothy, but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination. Dorothy visits Doss in jail and tries to convince him to plead guilty so that he can be released without charge but Doss refuses to compromise his beliefs. At his trial, Doss pleads guilty but before he is sentenced, his father barges into the tribunal with a letter from a former commanding officer stating that his son's pacifism is protected by an Act of Congress. The charges against Doss are dropped, and he and Dorothy are married.Doss' unit is assigned to the 77th Infantry Division and deployed to the Pacific theater. During the Battle of Okinawa, Doss' unit is informed that they are to relieve the 96th Infantry Division. In the initial fight, both sides sustain heavy losses. Meanwhile, Doss successfully saves several soldiers, including those with severe injuries. The next morning, the Japanese launch a massive counterattack and drive the Americans off the escarpment. Smitty is killed and many Americans, including Howell and several of Doss' squad mates, are injured and left on the battlefield. After Smitty, who is Doss buddy, is dead, Doss hears the cries of the dying soldiers and decides to run back into the carnage. He starts carrying wounded soldiers to the cliff's edge and rappelling them down by rope, each time praying to save one more. The arrival of dozens of wounded once presumed dead comes as a shock to the rest of the unit below. When day breaks, Doss rescues Howell and the two finally escape Hacksaw under enemy fire. Doss rescue totally 75 soldier include Japanese soldier.Captain Glover tells Doss that the men have been inspired by his miraculous efforts, and that they will not launch the next attack without him. Despite the next day being Doss' Sabbath day, he joins his fellow soldiers after finishing his prayers. With reinforcements, they turn the tide of battle and Japan surrendered the battle. Doss is eventually wounded by a grenade blast, but the battle is won. Doss descends the cliff, clutching the Bible Dorothy gave him.After rescuing 75 soldiers at Hacksaw Ridge, Doss is awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman.

Strongly directed with intense battle scenes,"I now have a new leader in the clubhouse for BEST PICTURE OF 2016 - HACKSAW RIDGE.From the Director of BRAVEHEART (more on that later), HACKSAW RIDGE tells the true story of Desmond Doss, the first Conscientous Objector to win the Medal of Honor when he saved 75 men from certain death on Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa during WWIIThis film is divided into 3 parts.  The first focuses on Doss at home before the war, falling in love and dealing with an alcoholic father who is fighting his own demons from his experience in WW1, the second is your typical bootcamp scene where his platoon-mates and drill sargent must come to terms with Doss' Conscientous Objector status, and finally, the last part focuses on the experience on Hacksaw Ridge.The opening 3rd of the film is fairly pedestrian, it introduces us to the Doss character and the reasons for his stand on never touching a gun.  It would not have been successful if it were not for the work of Hugo Weaving as Doss' father.  He is absolutely terrific, and almost unrecognizable, as the worn down alchoholic who is still suffering PTSD from his experiences in WW1.The 2nd part of the film is a typical bootcamp scene and all of Doss' barrack-mates are pretty generic, I wish the director would have attempted to make them a bit more different, for when we get into the battle scene, when they are all wearing the same battle fatigues and are covered with mud, it is hard to determine who is who.  Vince Vaughn is an interesting choice as the drill sargent who comes to understand Doss.  He is not your typical drill sargent and underplays the role - something I would not have thought that Vaughn is capable of - I credit ""the director of Braveheart"".But the showpiece of this film is the last 3rd - the battle of Hacksaw Ridge.  This part of the movie ""out-Private Ryan's"" the D- Day scene of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the best filming of a WWII battle scene ever.  The director does not flinch away from the violence and tension of this scene and when Doss starts saving troops one by one and goes back ""for just one more"", I was on the edge of my seat.  It was truly moving and uplifting - a series of scenes not to be missed - but NOT for the squeamish.Up to this point, I have not mentioned the performance of the actor playing Doss nor the director, let me do so here.  First, Andrew Garfield (THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN) is terrific as Doss, again, underplaying his role and showing a strength of soul throughout the film.  I was a bit disturbed by his Sourthern Accent, but - at the end of the film - they show an interview with the real Doss and, darn it, Garfield nails the accent of the real man, so cut him some slack when you see this film, folks.Also, you will need to cut some slack to the director - Mel Gibson - he is, not surprisingly, omitted from all publicity from this film - and rightfully so - for his off-screen behavior.  If folks knew that this was a Mel Gibson film, they would be turned off and not go see it and that is too bad as this is a well directed film that tells an uplifting story that should be viewed by folks.  Say what you will about Gibson off-screen, but in this film, he is a heckuva director.9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

In my whole life i have never seen something as wonderful as it. Lol i4m crying. Love the acting so much , it deserves all the Oscar !",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A solid return for Gibbo.,"It has been ten years since Mel Gibson was calling the shots for Mayan saga Apocalypto, but his direction here is so confident and ambitious you wouldn't know it. It's like he never left. This true story is essentially split into three parts: the introductory story to our heroic protagonist, the training segment full of adversity, and the horrific battle between the Yanks and the Japanese atop the eponymous ridge. Each act is better than the last, with the family and romantic drama at the beginning slow and not totally convincing, the boot camp section predictable but highly engaging, and the extended war climax an immersive triumph. It doesn't come as a surprise that Gibbo feels most comfortable with the battle scenes—he is the director of Braveheart after all—and in this respect he is firing on all cylinders, creating a truly intense and visceral experience. The death and decay is gruesome and unsettling—you can almost smell the burning flesh and rotting corpses—but the savagery is necessary to generate the authentic juxtaposition of horror and heroism. Portraying Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to win the Medal of Honor, Andrew Garfield is put the through the wringer both physically and emotionally, ultimately giving a solid performance despite working with some cheesy melodrama at the start. The supporting cast are predominantly strong, particularly Hugo Weaving who acts the hell out of his drunken WWI vet and Vince Vaughn who dishes out a delightfully shouty and zinger-filled turn as Doss' drill sergeant. A moving tale of one man's struggle to stay true to his beliefs whilst helping his country in the most harrowing of circumstances, Hacksaw Ridge is proof that Gibson should be behind the camera more often.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An incredibly shot war film telling an irresistibly immersive story,"Despite Mel Gibson's ongoing controversy in the Hollywood limelight, his directional skills remain as tactless as his breakthrough back in 1995 with Braveheart, despite the 10-year gap between this and his last directing feature. 'Hacksaw Ridge' is a true spectacle to behold, wonderfully exciting in the action pieces and fantastically entrancing in the quieter moments, ultimately conjugating to form this modern classic war film: emotional, gritty and stunning, achieving successes that haven't been truly fulfilled since Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan', almost 20 years ago.The plots follow the life of Desmond Doss and his determination to serve as a part of the army during World War 2, whilst also being a conscientious objector. He is sent to Fort Jackson to train with the 77th Infantry Division, who are assigned to the island of Okinawa, a potentially crucial space of land in the Americans battle against the Japanese. Doss' inner struggle with the convictions of his beliefs is suitably portrayed by the remarkably similar looking Andrew Garfield, who is establishing himself as a high rising talent, venturing further from his youthful popular appeal into challenging new prospects, and in this instance, producing a heart-warming and captivating performance as the film's lead.He is supported by a tremendous collection of esteemed actors (notably very few females here though), and the characters are individually distinctive. One of particular interest is Vince Vaughn, who plays Sergeant Howell, the brutal army Sergeant in charge of Doss' training. Known for his comedic roles throughout the 2000s, Vaughn has recently endeavoured to do more serious roles to differentiate from his very hit and miss comedy career. He displays his ability with persistence, jockeying his hardcore acting with also being the most comedic aspect of the film, and pulls it off tremendously. Furthermore, the fact that Hugo Weaving didn't receive an Oscar nomination for his supporting role as Doss's father, Tom, is bewildering. With an emotional and scarring past, Tom Doss is proficiently portrayed by Weaving who is consistently enigmatic when on screen, an absolute scene-stealer in every one he is in, and extremely enticing to watch.But it is the cinematography that makes 'Hacksaw Ridge' an excellent war movie. The serenity, yet mundanity, of Doss' home town of Lynchburg, juxtaposed by spectacular scenes of battle between the Americans and the Japanese, 'Hacksaw Ridge' is very much a tale of two halves, each as interesting and gripping as the other. Gibson sustains tension throughout in many different formats, whether that be through family collisions, military attitudes towards Doss or conflict on the battlefield, there is always something to be enticed about. It is, however, let down by certain moments where the situation is overdramatised, with situations contrasted too often, resulting in moments of mixed impact, where the outcome should have been resolute.Ultimately, 'Hacksaw Ridge' is an exceptional biopic that places a bold stamp on the war genre, and is undeniably a great accomplishment in directing, acting and cinematography.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Cartoonish is the nicest possible way I can describe this movie.,"Let me start by saying that the true story of Desmond T Doss is nothing short of incredible! What an amazing individual he must have been!This film however, is absolutely dreadful!! I cannot comprehend how it's getting such great reviews. I can get over the fact that Spider- Man is trying to play the role of a real-life war hero. I cannot get over Vince Vaughn and his painfully bad attempt at playing the part of a drill sergeant. I love Vince Vaughn but this performance is awkward at the very best. Completely unconvincing in his portrayal of a soldier and drill sergeant.Let's move on to accuracy in film... There is none. I mean none WHATSOEVER! The uniforms and equipment look very bargain basement which is disappointing considering the films 40 million dollar budget. The way military life and combat were depicted place this film in the same realm as Starship Troopers and early John Wayne films.With movies like Braveheart and Apocalypto under his belt, I expected so much more from Gibson in the directing of this movie. In past works, he conveyed so much emotion and passion that you almost couldn't help but be swept up in the story. Hacksaw Ridge, however, pays no attention to detail. The scripting was uninspired, unconvincing and completely unrealistic.I understand that no film could ever live up to the real-life heroism of Desmond Doss. But the attempt could have, and SHOULD have been much better! It makes me cringe to think that all some people will ever know of his awe-inspiring life, is what they saw in this shameful piece of film making.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Most Realistic and Inspiring War Movie Ever,"The acting was more convincing than any war movie I have ever seen, and it was pretty accurate with the facts of Desmond Doss, except that according to those were there, they say that is was far more harrowing than the movie depicts, particularly when Desmond set up the net to hang down from the cliff with two others. That this is a true movie, well, it had all of us on the edge of our seats, the movie depicts the horror and terror of war more accurately than any this war buff has ever seen.

Could have been a great movie,"If it hadn't been for the typical overdone battle scenes, this could have been a great movie and a tribute to the man it was about. Anyone who has had any kind of military training can see that the battle scenes were totally over the top and unrealistic. There didn't seem to be any kind of battle strategy. There were so many weapons that never have to be reloaded, and when they fire them, they almost never miss the target. Even fully automatic weapons being sprayed wildly never seem to miss. Go to a shooting range and see how many there can shoot anywhere near that good, and those are the ones that go there on a regular basis. If you've never been, see if you can rent a gun. You'll be surprised at how difficult it really is. Granted, a rifle is much more accurate than a pistol, but in the high stress of battle, it's not going to be like shooting at targets. People that believe this kind of ""action"" are the same ones that probably think that police can shoot the guns out of the bad guys hands. It's just impossible to shoot that rapidly with any kind of accuracy. This was a golden opportunity to make a really good movie about an important character in American history, but it missed the mark. Life is not a video game.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"The Mel Gibson Comeback Movie: Brutal, Hopeful And A Bit Weak","Hacksaw Ridge is the violent, inspiring and audacious comeback film that Mel Gibson has needed for over a decade, and the end results have certainly paid off for him. Scoring many award wins and nominations, as well as critical acclaim, Gibson is back in the good graces of Hollywood after many personal controversies. And with this film, it is clear why: it's a biopic on someone who hasn't received the recognition deserved, features explosive war scenes, and has a great cast, but it is quite far from perfect.Gibson's overall direction is mixed. The action scenes are where he shines brightest here, as the length and brutality of them harken back to a time where Gibson was one of Hollywoods best and most transgressive directors. However, the entire first half of the film is very much average, where the characters are being introduced and developed. The film occasionally delved into schmaltz, which ruined the flow of the film.The writing of Hacksaw Ridge is also very average. The dialogue throughout the first half is nothing special, and the plot feels disorderly. The big climatic final is awkwardly written and directed, as if it could be removed from the film and have no real difference. Andrew Garfield gave a good performance, but his character, although based on a brave and truly awe-inspiring person, sometimes seemed like a punchline rather the heart and soul of the vicious film he was in.The acting as a whole, like much else of the film, went for average or passable rather then go for great. The cast was splendid, and appeared to be having fun, but the acting wasn't great from any single person. The editing was poor in many of the earlier scenes, and the sound mix was murky at times, making it hard to hear dialogue.But there was a lot to love about Hacksaw Ridge. Again, most of the second half (sans the final ten minutes) was amazing, with the war scenes continuously shocking and petrifying audiences for its long durations. Andrew Garfield always portrayed real life hero Desmond Doss' religion and beliefs with respect, even if sometimes it felt directed differently. And for all of its faults, it was a darn entertaining movie with enough humour spread throughout to not let the audience fall into a deep pessimistic pit of despair once leaving the theater.If nothing more, Mel Gibson is back, and perhaps he will now get a bigger budget next time to truly take us back to his Braveheart days. Hacksaw Ridge is a good film that does a great job of exploring how a real person's ethical and spiritual beliefs were tested by World War II, even if the film did feel average in its earlier scenes.3.5 / 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
War - The saviour,"This is based on a true story, which makes it even more amazing when you think about everything that happens. Of course you could start to question the motives and the morale of the main character (real person). But you would derive yourself of a really powerful but also violent movie. Teresa Palmer and the personal life may seem like a footnote, but they also show a strong personality.And while we can understand why there are so many people who try to discourage our main hero, we get a bit of an inside what makes him tick. Very early on in his life he had an inciting incident. One that scares you for life, one that is really paving the way. So the set up is clear, the action scenes on the other hand are very dirty and very brutal. But that is war, it's not for the squeamish. And while you may have issues with Mel Gibson and his private life (decisions), you can't fault the movie ...",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Inspirational Mel,"This movie is the extraordinary true story of Desmond Doss who, in Okinawa during the bloodiest battle of WWII, saved 75 men without firing or carrying a gun. ""Hacksaw Ridge"", the first movie my beloved Mel Gibson has directed in a decade, is as much patriotic, as you can get.When it comes to directing war films, Mel Gibson has proved himself as the best of the best over the years. From ""Braveheart"" to ""Apocalypto"", this man has created tons of entertainment for audiences to enjoy. This movie is a story you probably didn't know, and will be glad you did. The battle scenes in ""Hacksaw Ridge"" are among the most violent captured on film. In general it is a good movie with solid acting, directing, and cinematography, heartwarming, inspirational, and engaging from start to finish.

Born to Kill meets Peace.,"Do any of you fine people remember Full Metal Jacket? Pvt. Joker in Vietnam has a helmet that features the words ""BORN TO KILL"" on one part and right by it is a peace symbol. He is asked about it by a superior officer who finds it to be a sick joke, and Joker responds that it's part of the ""duality of man, the whole Jungian thing."" In that sense, Hacksaw Ridge is the most Jungian war movie ever made, and I'm not sure if that's entirely a great thing. It may be fascinating after the fact, that it could be a film that's worth talking about after it ends, but while watching it this dichotomy is bizarre. I think part of this too goes back to Francois Truffaut's quote about war movies, that it's very difficult, close to impossible, to make an anti-war film when the action itself makes war look like a bloody good action movie.Platoon was one of the only films to be anti-war and have action in it that was well shot and executed. Hacksaw Ridge isn't that really. Its first half actually does, what I found, a decent and compellingly dramatic job of showing this guy Desmond Doss (sic) and how in his upbringing around a drunk PTSD'd father (a terrific Hugo Weaving) and nearly killing his brother (and, later on we learn, his father too in a fight), it's actually clear to see why he would embrace non-violence so strongly. Even if the guy never picked up a Bible in his life, his experiences inform his worldview, it's just that the word on killing- thou shalt not of course- extends to Doss in a way that is his total conviction. He even has a fairly sweet romance with a girl in the film and all that is fine; if anything the first half of the film, including a training sequence with Vince Vaughn in a role that reminds one how he can do dramatic work (and be funny while doing it), is engaging.But that second half is where Gibson gets to let loose and get into being BLOODY MEL Gibson (ala Bloody Sam Peckinpah, though not anywhere near Peckinpah's real innovations in filming violence in such an eye and rhythm that revolutionized things, this doesn't do that). The battle scenes here could lay claim to being the most gruesome in the history of cinema - at the least somewhere Spielberg has to be going ""damn... that's a bit much"" - and maybe some of that is part of who Gibson is as a (sigh) artist, going back to Braveheart and on through Passion and Apocalypto, a man who seems as compelled to show ALL of the brutality the way that Doss was compelled to never pick up a gun, not once. And objectively, this action is intense and, maybe, in a few moments, exciting and intense as hell.The message of this character can't help but contradict how this filmmaker sees war, and this dichotomy, again going back to that ""Born to Kill/Peace"" ideal, is taken a little too literally to the point where Mel's/Desmond's man Jesus is taken into account here. Another thing structurally is that Hacksaw Ridge feels its length over almost 2 1/2 hours the most in the final stretch, the last half hour, when Desmond becomes a superhero practically speaking (ironically Gibson in interviews has put down superhero movies of the modern era). Is it true that he saved 75 people at this battle? I take the movie at its word, but there comes a point where it makes its hero SO heroic that it strains credulity. I'm not talking about whether it was true in real life, I mean more-so in the scope of the film's interpretation of it. Not to mention, Gibson *does* indulge in the kind of violence that I have to wonder if the real Desmond Doss would recoil at, including showing a (I think) Japanese general committing Harakiri at the moment of realizing the battle really is over. Uh... okay!If all you're looking for is a bloody, gory, maggots-all-in-the-corpses-and-there-are-the-rats-too action-war movie, then certainly it's inarguable Gibson delivers, and it's a step up in quality from the (I know I'm alone in this opinion I don't care) schlock that was his last film 10 years ago, Apocalypto. But that split between the hero's convictions, religious or otherwise, and how much this film basically revels in this brutality of the flesh, is hard to take. I felt exhausted by the end of this, for good and bad reasons. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Utter waste of time,"Hoo-rah! If it weren't for the admittedly intriguing story of an extremely religious man serving his country by helping the wounded, with no firearm, this would simply be yet another war movie glorifying America while their enemies, in this case the Japanese, are faceless and all the same, serving only as objects to shoot at. Enemies.But let's head back to the beginning. The movie sets the tone by beginning with a fiery scene, in which we see destruction and mayhem on the battlefield. Our main character Desmond Doss begins to narrate, quoting scripture, which gives us an idea where the film is heading. We are then taken back to his childhood, where we learn why he refuses to wield a firearm.This serves a nice introduction into why Desmond is the way he is. What doesn't work though is that barely 15 minutes into the movie, he meets a girl. Ten minutes later they want to get married.Given this is a two hour movie, this entire sequence could have been snipped, making for a snappier movie, while also allowing us to not suffer through the awful, sentimental melancholic bullcrap that we are forced to watch.This section of the movie honestly feels like a bog-standard romantic comedy, not to mention it feels very out of touch with the tone of the rest of the movie. It feels like it was shoehorned in, by someone lacking any ounce of filmmaking skill.After this trite, we move to the army barracks for training. Desmond's refusal to carry a gun is seen by most of his comrades (and superiors) as cowardly, and his religious beliefs are mocked. ""This is war"" he is told, implying that God's commandments don't apply on the battlefield.As if we are watching a remake of Full Metal Jacket, the next thirty or so minutes is dedicated to obstacle courses, a drill officer screaming insults at the privates (with little humour, unlike Kubrick's classic) while Desmond is alienated from the group. A religious, southern Private Pyle. Only Desmond's fate is far different, as we know.Soon we find ourselves in the battlefield, as the film borrows another scene, this one from Band of Brothers, as the fresh soldiers see the battered men retreating from their goal: to capture and hold Hacksaw Ridge. Much like the entire film, this scenes has no semblance of subtlety at all, as the camera focuses on the trucks carrying dead soldiers, all conveniently placed so that their heads are at the end of the truck, where we can see them. Oh, and their faces are all covered in a ton of blood - and not dried blood either.I'm not sure how dead men can bleed fresh blood either, but this film doesn't seem to have a great relationship with the concept of logic.The final part of the film is where the action takes place, and it seems clear from the start that this is made for the Call of Duty crowd. Soldiers are killed all over, but since we don't get to know any of them, their deaths have no impact at all, and are dismissed in a one minute conversation that night between the men left. The same can be said for the men Desmond is able to save. Who are they? Mel Gibson takes some cues from Passion of the Christ, as the battle scenes are needlessly bloody and gory. Multiple shots of legless men, intestines lying on the ground, rats eating maggots out of a corpse it is far too much.War is hell, we get it, but dwelling on the physical impact so much affects the rest of the movie. There should have been a lot to say, as Desmond's story is an incredible story of bravery and dedication. The fact that he had no gun on the battlefield is barely explored at all either, nor the situation of a religious man obeying the ten commandments on a war-field.There is nothing intelligent here. Simply another war film that screams ""GO America!"" to the rest of the world, as we watch them incinerate their enemies in slow motion, with swelling, orchestral music in the background.I liked Blood Father.

Best war movie I have ever seen.,"Oh my goodness Mel Gibson. I hated you for the racist and crude comments you have said but now I forgive you. This is the best war movie I have ever seen in my life. This rivals Saving Private Ryan and in my opinion, tops Saving Private Ryan mainly due to masterful acting and directing.Lets first talk about the acting. Andrew Garfield, you deserve an Oscar. You truly do. Vince Vaughn, you made an excellent comeback. Hugo Weaving, you also proved to be a very great and caring character that I love. Teresa Palmer, another great movie under your belt. I really can not elaborate as I will be heading into spoiler territory.Mel Gibson shot this movie very old school. All the shots seem like it is from the 1980s. That is not a bad thing as it really does set the tone of this movie. Everything to the color pallet to the dialogue really feels very natural and almost made me feel like I was eavesdropping into a legit conversation. This is because of great script-writing and acting by the amazing Andrew Garfield! Andrew Garfield really does make me feel like I was in the 1940s. He truly does set the tone for the time and I was extremely invested.WOW I never knew about this story and I am damn happy I now know. This story really did make me feel like I am a pussy. Not to mention that this movie has extreme religious undertones that is NOT shoved in your face. I hate religion and if I can stand it in this movie and even make me appreciate religion, then that is saying a lot. The plot really does advance kind of fast. That is a good thing as it is a fast paced movie. This movie will never let you from its grasp and it will show you the horrors of war. Other reviewers say that this movie is to bloody and Michael Bay like. I call those reviewers wrong in every way. They show you how war is like. Michael Bay just puts explosions in there for no reason and could do without the explosions. However Hacksaw Ridge every explosion is needed. They put explosions into the background for authenticity and atmosphere building and it CAN NOT do without it.Only cons of this movie is some slow-mo shots. They shot the scene in normal 24 fps and made it slow-mo after the movie was over. Making the 1 specific scene kind of weird and laggy. However this lasted maybe 1 second max and did not bother me one bit. I only recognized this on my 3rd viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A great film about a true hero,"When confronted with the word ""hero"", different people picture different men in their minds. Some think of superheroes, some think of immensely strong and fearless soldiers and some think of remarkable generals and leaders. We seem to forget that the key aspects of a true hero are bravery and selflessness. Mel Gibson's first film in over a decade is the biography of such a hero, a man who wasn't particularly strong or skilled, but was ready to risk his life to save others. Hacksaw Ridge is an inspiring story based on true events although at times it seems too romanticized.The story begins with Desmond Doss' (Andrew Garfield) childhood in Lynchbourg, Virginia. Desmond and his brother Hal grow up with their religious mother (Rachel Griffiths) and their troubled father (Hugo Weaving), an alcoholic who is still haunted by his WWI demons. When the United States entered WWII after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Desmund and his brother decide to enlist for the army as most people in their age did. Desmund joins the 77th division and starts his training, but has a hard time there as he refuses to even touch a gun. Killing another man, even in a war, is against his deep-rooted beliefs and his only purpose is to serve as a medic, saving people instead of killing them. The film then moves forward to 1945 and the battle of Okinawa where amidst a living hell, Desmund Doss saves numerous lives and shows what he's made of.I had read and heard about how good this film was and since it was one of the most nodded in the Oscars I had high expectations. I have to say that watching the first part was quite disappointing. Everything about Desmond's life before he enlisted seemed too Hollywood-esque. He appears as the perfect man, even though he had a difficult childhood growing up with an alcoholic father (which is not true for the real Desmond Doss' father), he falls in love with first sight with a beautiful girl and after two days he makes her fall in love with him too. It's like the screen writer preferred to please the audience rather than telling the true story. Fortunately, there was Hugo Weaving's performance to redeem me. Such an underrated actor, I really felt that he should have got at least a nomination for this season's awards. Everything got better after Desmond goes to the training camp, but still I could see nothing great about the picture.Much to the film's credit, I forgot everything when the battle scene started. The scene was breathtaking! The pace was excellent, the sound and directing kept me in the edge of my seat, the cinematography and costumes were perfect. I didn't know the historical details so I had no idea what the result would be and the film kept me guessing until the end sustaining suspense to the highest level. Desmond's heroic act was masterfully showcased and the footage in the end made for the perfect epilogue.Andrew Garfield was very good in this film and the supporting cast was solid. It's a great return for Mel Gibson who got his first Academy Award nomination since 1996 when he won two Oscars for Braveheart. Although it's not the masterpiece some people had me believe, it's still makes for a great war film which can both affect you with its touching story and thrill you with astonishing action moments.More reviews on https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Doss deserves better.,"A wonderful story, but overwrought and clumsy in a way that its real-life character doesn't deserve. The movie captures a dubious trick of being both overly melodramatic and emotionally unengaging. Andrew Garfield is the best thing about the movie: human, flawed and heroic in ways that feel very true to life. Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths do very good work too. Sadly, the rest of the movie doesn't live up to their performances. Doss' platoon-mates are poorly realized and unmemorable; we struggled to keep track of who was supposed to be who. The battle scenes are over-the-top orgies of mud, blood, flame, and suffering, with no rhythm or sense of moving action. This blunt force trauma builds until the final shot, which is hamfisted and groan-worthy. Only the coda, delivering interviews with the actual participants, brings the movie to a somewhat satisfying conclusion. I understand why people would want this to be a better movie than it is, but how Gibson received a Best Director nomination is beyond me, and must be a victory for politics over sense.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Personal view on the movie.,"In my own opinion it was a phenomenal movie which left me almost in tears in the cinema, it really got to my emotions and i really felt for the men in the movie, each actor really played their character and did a wonderful job at showing the conditions and emotions of warfare. There were a lot of moments i had to look away as it almost got to much, it isn't over censored which really helps show how bad some situations were. There is a lot of scenes with significant amount of gore which is good as a lot of war movies don't do this and it does help contribute to getting the full experience of war and what they dealt with and how they suffered. I would re- watch it without a doubt and definitely a movie i will be getting when it's released. I would say easily my new favourite movie. Andrew Garfield did a brilliant job of portraying his character and his belief of morals and values.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A film of two halves,"I didn't know that Mel Gibson had directed this film until the end and can honestly say that he has done good job.Based on a true story the first half of the film set the scene by introducing us to the characters and their backgrounds. Almost a love story film in it's own right.The second half bursts into life and tells us just why this film, focused on the life of Desmond Doss, had to be made.Full of mixed emotions, beliefs and views of life, the film presents with facts and scenes that many of us will not have known took place.Not a film for the faint-hearted (well the second half anyway), it holds nothing back.The final clips add so much to the film too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Plenty of action for those who are patient enough to wait for it,"Those who like their action movies to be founded in fact will enjoy this film. The heroism as depicted on screen is hard to believe, although in reality Army Medic Desmond T. Doss really did indeed achieve what any normal human being would imagine to be the impossible. While it understandably takes a while for the background story to be established, once the action starts the 'lead to air' ratio increases to the max. Director Mel Gibson and crew clearly pulled out all the stops to make the action scenes as realistic as possible. Some might even say the combat scenes are a little overdone, but then again you would have had to have been there to know for sure. Despite the various references to 'action' in this review, it's important to conclude by emphasizing the movie also tells a great story and encourages the viewer to reflect on the human costs of war.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I didn't have the words,"I walked into this movie knowing that everybody says it is really awesome and that it was the best of the year, so I thought I would probably enjoy it. After walking out of it though, I couldn't even find the words to describe how amazing this film was. Andrew Garfield did excellent and the rest of the very talented cast did amazing as well. The story as a whole throughout the entire movie was amazing as well. The beginning of the movie was really good and then it just got better and better as I kept watching this play out, it was incredible. I walked out speechless at first as to decide about what I truly thought of it, because it was all so much to take in. After a lot of thought though, it finally came to me that this is one of my favorite movies, and I will remember it forever, for it was truly incredible and it couldn't be better than how it is now, excellent work Mel Gibson.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Short and to the point,"The movie directed by Mel Gibson. The true story of Desmond Doss, the conscientious objector who joined the army during II World War and refused to carry the gun.

aw shucks sincerity,"Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) grew up with his brother Hal, his loving mother Bertha (Rachel Griffiths), and volatile drunken father Tom (Hugo Weaving) who returned damaged from the Great War. His mother's religious upbringing and childhood traumas lead him to be a Seventh-day Adventist. He falls in love with nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer). To his father's dismay, Hal joins the military. Desmond joins anyways but he insists on being a conscientious objector. His view clashes with Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) and the military commanders. He even faces court-martial. During the Battle of Okinawa, he becomes the last man to leave Hacksaw Ridge after being over-run and ends up saving many of his comrades.Andrew Garfield does his aw shucks puppy-face acting which I find a bit annoying. It's deliberately naive at times. A corollary of that happens with his reasoning for joining the military. He seems to join out of embarrassment. I want him to be more resolute in his religious belief and I need him to state his need to save more directly. There is a comparison to Gary Cooper's Sergeant York whose religious conversion is spelled out more clearly. The solution is all right there in the movie. He needs to save his brother or somebody like his brother. He just needs to do is say that.Mel Gibson is a highly skilled director and the action is top notch. The movie can be heavy-handed at times. On the other hand, the heaviest-handed moment of him walking alone into a field of artillery fire is probably the best moment in the movie. It is a balancing act. It works most of the times but Mel can push it too far into overwrought territory. Overall, he has created a movie in his own vision and that's pretty compelling.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Overrated, not great","Focuses too much on the simple premise rather than creating a good story around the circumstances. So the main character doesn't like guns, okay we get it. All this movie does is hammer this idea and try to make something profound from the character's religions motivations. The result is quite boring.""My bible! My bible!""... prepare to cringe. I can't recommend this movie, there's no reason for a feature to be made from this.Regardless of how many people the guy saved, he still put his comrades at risk by not arming himself. He got lucky, so what? God had nothing to do with that. I'm not sure if this film is suggesting that this was God's miracle or just a religious nut-case who got lucky.Either way, the story is not inspirational, and the actual film wasn't very creative or elevated beyond clichéd American patriotism and stereotypical supporting roles.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Must Watch for 2016!,"This movie was riveting from beginning to end. I watch over 150 movies every year and rate them all. I only gave out 4 tens this year with this being one of them. As far as war movies go, this has it all. It might be my absolute favorite but if not it is in my top 5 all time. Acting was terrific, directing was terrific (congrats to Mel Gibson), and to think this was a true story that was never told on the big screen is amazing.There were no ""dead"" spots in the movie. It is engaging to the audience from beginning to end. It has a re-watch factor and will not lose anything.For anyone that like war movies, this is the one to watch. For anyone that like true stories, this is also the one. I is heart wrenching, emotional on all levels and show America in a time of conflict what a true hero is.

How could a man walk into such a hellish place ... this movie is like nothing you have ever seen it contains drama and romance and action and comedy in perfect harmony ... the film isn't cheesy in anyway and it gives right to Dessmond T Doss. This man deserve to be known and i believe he's made justice. Lets hope we shine light on real life heroes that does not wear spandex. The actors did an outstanding job their performance was amazing and i'm surprised with Vince Vaughn he does have a talent after all.

Wow! The Best Movie of The Decade!,"Wow, just wow...I can't find the right words, but I'll try. Sometimes you see truly fantastic films, and sometimes you see something that is timeless films, that have a certain aura and quality - and yes, this is without a doubt such an instant classic. If you have a heart you'll love this film, simple as that. It doesn't matter if you are so smart enough that you can figure things out along the way...duuh! Movies is really about feelings, what ever they may be, and this film makes the audience feel. A lot! At the Cinema Theatre I visited grown men were crying, women were crying and I also had to fight the tears (already early on) - and that was even way before the gruesome battle scenes have started! It felt like 3 good movies in one great!If I have to compare with other movies, it's like a mix of Forrest Gump meeting Saving Private Ryan. Kind of. But still not at all.This true story of Desmond Doss is amazing! Director Mel Gibson tells it so straight forward it reminds of an old time classic in the style of old Hollywood but with todays effects. It could have been done by perhaps Howard Hawks, Frank Capra, John Ford, Michael Curtiz, John Huston, but with his own masters eye. Mel Gibson is a wise storyteller here, very impressing piece of work. He knows he doesn't have to add things to it - in fact he holds back! No scene is longer than necessary, it's always to the point. The acting is very good and the music is perfect, not too much not too little. It's a better film than his other masterpiece Braveheart and that should tell you something! I really hope this one also wins an Oscar for Best Picture because it simply is such an Oscar worthy film! By far, if you ask me, it's one of the best films ever made! I've seen about 10 000 Movies - and this masterpiece makes it to my personal Top 50 of all time! It's so strong, so gripping, so emotional and a fascinating true story about humanity and the true WWII hero Desmond Doss! It's not another typical war movie, it's a life story that takes you on an emotional roller-coaster! I simply can't find the right words to describe it, so I just recommend everyone to see this as soon as you can!Cinema Theatres were made for these kinds of fantastic films!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
a film that understands the brutality of war,"Hacksaw Ridge is a film directed by Mel Gibson and stars Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Teresa Palmer, Sam Worthington, and Hugo Weaving. It is about a young soldier named Desmond Doss who is a young man enlisting into the army by saving lives instead of taking them at the battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge. this film is as passionate about it's characters and it's source material as it does about it's violence. that's how good it is.after you are immediately drawn into the film, it takes you back to when he was little to when he signed up for war. each moment of this film just loves to pull you into the story which makes you feel present in every situation that Doss comes across. it feels real and raw and worthy of praise. this is a film that not only can show how much of an effect that war can have on a human being but, it shows war, blood, death, ad all the violence you in saving private Ryan times a billion.the war in this movie is gritty and you will leave the theater shocked at what you saw. limbs are flying everywhere, guts are exploding from stomachs, blood is everywhere, bodies are left to rot in dirt and ash. you feel as if every time a gun is fired, death comes immediately after. it's incredibly brutal, and effective, and painful to look at. when someone is shot you feel as if they're getting shot at. it's very effective and you will watch every explosion on screen without breathing just like the soldiers did in this movie. it's intense.the characters are characters that you will grow attached to. Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss pulls off an Oscar Worthy performance as the man that saved 75 lives on that field. every emotion coming from him is real and it's emotional. you want him to make it out alive and you want him to succeed. every time he saves a life, your fists will pump in the air. Vince Vaughn as Sergeant Howell is another Oscar Worthy Performance that shows a ton of humanity into all the spit he brings to each soldier's face as he screams at them. Hugo Weaving does a great job as the alcoholic and abusive father that needs to deal with a troubling past, and Teresa Palmer whom I've never been a fan off pulls a great performance as Desmond's wife. Mel Gibson got really talented people to play the parts he has handed out and it shows.This movie is an incredible war film of faith, heart, humanity, and Violence and what it can do mentally to people. Mel Gibson has really outdone himself and I will be happy to see him be recognized as a great director once again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"An amazing film, brilliantly constructed.","Hacksaw Ridge is a brilliant achievement in film making.

It's practicality and use of CGI was blended in a seamless visual marvel supported by beautiful cinematography with newly created shots of the like I had not seen before but were stunningly effective.MEL got great performances from his actors with Garfield, Vaughn giving there strongest on screen performances. Worthington and Weaving providing a very strong pool of secondary acting.A great story given true justice, even if at times it was a little heavy handed. The movie is a masterpiece. Well done MEL, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone but my mother (tad violent ha ha).",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A Great Story, Poorly Told","Hacksaw Ridge is ultimately a good film made about a great story that squanders much of its potential with wooden dialogue, countless clichés, and telegraphed punches rather than foreshadowing.When I saw the movie, I didn't know much about it and somehow missed in the opening credits that it was directed by Mel Gibson, but as I watched, I remember repeatedly saying to myself, ""Man, someone has a persecution complex."" Doss' pacifism was a central theme; it was so integral to the plot, that nobody could have missed it if it had not been treated so heavy-handedly. This would have been much better if it had been a war movie in which the protagonist takes a philosophical stand, rather than a movie about a man being persecuted for his beliefs (often fairly) with the war going on as a sub-plot and vehicle for it.The grisly violence portrayed in the war scenes failed to create the atmosphere of a battlefield in the same way that better directed movies did; the reliance on graphic violence served to highlight the lack of tension and fear that should have been palpable, as we've been given in Full Metal Jacket or Saving Private Ryan, for that matter.Still, the backbone of truth in the story is strong enough to overcome many of the film's shortcomings. Though most of the characters were just cartoon sketches of real people (many of them pretty cheesy), they were hard not to like... especially Doss himself, and his broken father.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A big round of applause for Desmond Doss and Mel Gibson!,"This is a remarkable film, that shoots right to the top of best war films in cinema history. The story of Desmond Doss is a compelling one which needed to be told cinematically, and Gibson was the right man for this. The first hour has many virtues, but also problems: Doss' mistreatment seems to lack (comparisons with Full Metal Jacket are inevitable) and the court martial hearing does not ring true. But once they move to Okinawa, what follows is a technical tour de force, with realistic, gruesome battle scenes, extremely well and clearly directed and photographed action, and with an impressive emotional and transcendental punch to boost, which will make you stand up and applaud at the end. I don't see Gibson glorifying war while condemning it, I see him as a true artist, with a view of the history of mankind as war and violence, presenting life in all its hellish reality, and a hero pursuing a higher aim amid the brutality and personal challenge. This film should gather Oscar nominations for best picture, direction, actor in a leading role, script, cinematography, production design and sound, at least. I am particularly happy for Gibson, who survived his own personal trial, and is now back, and in better form than ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

This movie has stunning cinematography, beautiful action and flawless acting, especially from Andrew Garfield, who plays the protagonist Private Desmond Doss. This film never has a dull moment and keeps you on the edge of your seat in awe. This is one to remember and will definitely be a future classic.

Heroes Never Die!!!,"Wow I just watched this movie the other day and it was Insane. I will start with the story which is about Pfc. Desmond Doss who won the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving 75 men in the Battle of Okinawa during WW2 for those who don't know their history. The story is executed perfectly in the roughly 2hr and 15min movie. The first half shows his life and boot camp and the second half the Battle at Hacksaw Ridge. The movie is based on a true story as well which makes it that much more grounded. The acting is tremendously Superb. I mean Andrew Garfield killed it lol. No pun intended. I know some people don't like him but he was great at portraying a convicted individual who's beliefs were being attacked. The other three standouts were Capt. Glover played by Sam Worthington and Sgt. Howell played by Vince Vaughn and finally Tom Doss played by Hugo Weaving. They all were Impeccable in their acting. The action was honestly some of the most Intense I have seen in a Military Movie to date and I have watched a ton of Military films and I have studied military history. The depiction of the battle of Hacksaw Ridge was very authentic and extremely heart palpitating. The Japanese were and are in my opinion the greatest threat that Americans have ever faced in battle. They were extremely formidable and were not afraid to die at any given second. I digress but the battle was bloody and full of shock value but not unrealistic by any sense. The cinematography was honestly perfect in every shot and frame. I will close by saying this is honestly the Best Military movie I have seen to date including in my opinion surpassing ""Saving Private Ryan"" and Mel Gibson as always is a Beast of a director. I was honestly in tears at the end of the movie when they showed the real life interviews of the actual heroes of that real life event. Go and Watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerful! A remarkable film about a remarkable true story.,"Whatever opinions you may have of Mel Gibson, the man did say some terrible things in the past, but one thing we can't get over is the fact that he's a master filmmaker. HACKSAW RIDGE is a powerful depiction of pure-hearted heroism. A remarkable film about an remarkable true story you can't believe actually happened. And with his compelling performance, Andrew Garfield has placed himself among some of the greatest actors of all time.Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) was Seventh-Day Adventist, a faithful Christian. But when WWII happened, he couldn't sit idly by while his fellow brothers went out to fight. Not believing in killing, Doss refused to take up arms and instead chose to serve as Army medic. This personal decision caused tension in his unit, but ultimately the army allowed him to go into hell fire without a single weapon to protect him. There at the Battle of Okinawa, one of the bloodiest battles of WWII, Doss ended up saving the lives of many of his fellow soldiers resulting in him being the first conscientious objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honor.In this day and age when ignorant folks like Trump loudly and proudly describe masculinity as marginalizing the others and oppressing the powerless, stories like Desmond Doss reminds us what it truly means to be courageous. That's what I love about this is that it turns the notion that if you don't kill, then you're a coward, over on its head. It's a miracle if you think about it, Doss risked his life in the midst of a battlefield to pull his fellow soldiers one by one to safety, a story that remarkable deserves well-crafted film and that's what HACKSAW RIDGE gives us.Excellent performances by all the actors involved in this film, almost all of them are not even actual Americans and yet you can't tell difference when you see them on the screen because they embody the essence and they serve the story with immense respect. That transition from this beautiful landscape of home and romance into an awful place where bodies mangled everywhere, that itself will evoke heart-wrenching emotions. Of course, this is a Mel Gibson movie, so don't expect any less than hard R, the man doesn't shy away from cinematic violence, so brace yourself for intense prolonged graphic war sequences and grisly images, just as the rating itself says, it will get you to the core. Much bloodier war sequences than ""Saving Private Ryan."" But I think that is necessary because in order to do Doss' story justice, you can't sugarcoat or soften what have clearly been described in war records about those fateful days.In his portrayal of Desmond Doss, Andrew Garfield approaches it like the good guys' good guy, so convincingly that by the end of this film, even if you're not much a man of faith, you're going to say, 'I want what that guy has.' There's something that's so Gary Cooper and Jimmy Stewart about Andrew Garfield in this film. This is his most mature, most perfect performance yet.Overall, you don't have to be a Christian to fully appreciate this film, Mel Gibson himself had said that this is a love story, a man's love for his fellow man. So if you come at it from that perspective, you'll still be able to embrace it too, because Doss' story needs to be told and shared from one generation to the next and HACKSAW RIDGE is a great way of going about it.-- Rama's Screen --",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A remarkable hero and a remarkable movie,"This is the best large scale war movie in years. The screenplay by Robert Schenkkan is emotionally charged and involving. The direction by Mel Gibson is superb. The battle sequences is second to none. Scary and not confusing at all. This movie is a must watch.The first part shows the childhood and character shaping events of Desmond Doss. It may seem slow to those eager for a typical war movie but his unique personality is what made him different and such a unique hero. His alcoholic father and other reasons why he abhorred violence are made clear. His romance is unlike some movies not annoying at all. Teresa Palmer makes a believable and warm love interest. She reminds of a more salt of the earth K Stew - really purty. His training and the opposition he faced not carrying a gun seems a little too much. Makes you more amazed why he still wanted to fight at all. All this gets a lot of sympathy for the main character emotionally like most Mel Gibson's movies you are 100% behind the hero.Then the battle begins. That ridge looks pretty daunting. I know it wasn't possible to film in actual locations since the location in Okinawa is very much built over. But the ridge doesn't look like the landscape of Okinawa I guess because it was filmed in Australia. But that doesn't detract much from the terrific battle sequences that are scary and some of the best ever filmed. After the first main battle is over then the heroics of Desmond start and they are just so unbelievable it has to be a true story.Andrew Garfield is right doing the hillbilly thing well and then the unlikely hero even better. He is perfect for the role. It helps to have recognizable supporting cast like Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey so you can remember who is who when they are fighting.This is a movie that will leave you spent. If Mel's name didn't carry with it the unfortunate associations with his tirades it ought to bag all the awards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Say hello to Marty Stu.,"I make a point to avoid reading hype and review before seeing a film and this case was no different.I walked into the theater knowing absolutely nothing about the film, only that it was a WWII film and a Mel Gibson one.It was an enjoyable film and I don't understand people giving it very low scores. But I also don't understand people giving this film a perfect score or really high scores. This film is far from perfect.It has one thing to say and it says it over and over. There is no subtlety, no nuance, no depth.As entertaining as this film is, the main character is a Marty Stu. People (rightly) call out every Mary Sue they see and it's only fair to call out this Gary Stu.He is the strongest, fastest athlete in the whole crew. He can finish first in an obstacle course even if he's attacked in the middle of the course. He gets the hottest girl. He never lies. He never defends himself (even with his arms) when attacked. He doesn't even flinch. He's so brave. He's the perfect son, the perfect American, the perfect Christian, the perfect husband. He's also a vegetarian. The only flaw he is is that there's just one of him.There are parts of this that are based on reality, but many aren't. Was he really the fastest and strongest? Doubt it. In real life his fiancée was not a nurse when they met. Father was not abusive. Doss never bricked anyone as a child nor did he almost kill his father with the gun. That never happened. Gibson just tried to win brownie points for Desmond intervening in a domestic abuse case. The real Doss Sr. was not abusive towards the mother nor the children. The actual fight was between the father and the uncle, but a fight between brothers with the mother stepping in doesn't get you as many points as a drunk husband beating his wife, threatening her with a gun and the son stopping it, saving his mum's life. The mother is the real hero in real life, but Gibson wants us to think she's the victim and Desmond is the hero, the superhero or Marty Stu.The war scenes also have some major inaccuracies for something that is thoroughly researched. The bulletproof human shield was something from a video game, not a serious film. Bottomless magazine technology is something we're still researching today, but they apparently had it in the 40's.The drill sergeant scene was funny, but out of place. The whole love at first sight is cheesy and that too felt out of place.Saving Private Ryan, for example, is one consistent piece in mood and quality. This felt like pieces of Full Metal Jacket, the Notebook and and then some gory war film tacked together to make this into what it is. The moods are inconsistent.I enjoyed this film but would not watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerful Retelling of an American Hero's Courage and Spiritual Conviction,"Mel Gibson does it again, proving himself once again to be one of Hollywood's best directors. Andrew Garfield brings a compelling Desmond Doss and Gibson rightly centers him in the majority of the film. I've seen reviews that bristle at the gruesome violence and temper that with the ""war is hell"" statement, but even Vince Vaughn said they had to reduce the violence not for audience acceptance, but rather that Doss's exemplary live-saving efforts would otherwise almost be beyond human comprehension. This film is an outstanding testament to and recognition of a rare man who had the both the courage to not let his Christian convictions be compromised while earnestly supporting his country without regard for his own life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Hacksaw Ridge,"Mel Gibson's new directorial effort, Hacksaw Ridge, is not only one of the best war movies of recent years (some are saying the best since Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, which I would agree with), but it is also a rare film of courage, standing true to what one believes in and is ultimately an excellent and encouraging story of one man's Christian faith and the decision to go to war as a medic and yet refuse to carry a gun, or use or deploy any acts of violence whatsoever based on his beliefs. Our main character Desmond Doss, is brought up in a home where there is a fair bit of dysfunction largely based on the father's difficulty with what was then horrific memories and reflections of the first world war in which he served and which now causes him much pain and sorrow leading him to use alcohol as a means of trying to heal his wounds in what would today be considered as post traumatic stress disorder. While there is fighting and arguments among the Doss household, Desmond does cling to his Christian faith and even as an adult carries those beliefs with him even while enlisting to go to war. Desmond's idea is to be a war medic and save lives instead of killing others as he considered himself to be a conscientious objector and was totally opposed to violence and killing based on his strong Christian beliefs. Desmond while at boot camp and training to go to war is often made fun of verbally and also attacked physically for what the other soon to be soldiers did not understand and took to be an act of cowardice and oh how Desmond would prove them wrong. Desmond was certainly persecuted for his beliefs and his faith, but the absolutely amazing thing is that he never denounced his faith, or wanted to give up and he kept persevering even though it brought about condemnation and laughs and jeers from others. This is not giving any spoilers away, but Desmond does make it to the war and through praying and keeping true to the word of God as well as obeying the fellow soldiers and ultimately having the outlook of loving your neighbour as yourself he does far more than any of his fellow soldiers thinks he is capable of and truly proves himself to be a hero not only as a soldier and medic, but also as a true Christian soldier and one who placed God first and foremost in his life and would not disobey on the battlefield, or more importantly to the God who saw him through these personal and physical battles and would ultimately see him not only rewarded for his faith and devotion, but also Desmond truly becomes a wonderful example to his fellow soldiers and those in command of what a great Christian witness he is and one that the other soldiers because of his example that they would not soon forget. The film while very violent at times especially in it's second half should not stop viewers from seeing and embracing this inspiring and truly inspirational film and true story. This is not just simply a war film, but a man's own personal war against the people and powers that be that tried to suppress him and his faith only to be proved wrong and ultimately giving God the true and total glory that he deserves through Desmond's wonderful example and act of courage and faith. This film is about as good as you can get these days and everything here is done to sheer perfection from the outstanding acting to the war scenes to the makeup, sets and everything done to capture not only the period elements of the time, but also to not only take us to those battle lines, but make us feel as if we were right there and experiencing them for ourselves. There were some scenes that were so realistic that there were certainly times I jumped out of my seat in pure terror and other scenes were I was so deeply engrossed into the film and it's story as well. I hope that the R rating and the more graphic violence does not keep people away, but instead that people give this film a chance and be totally encouraged and yet blown away by the sheer power and yet beautiful nature of this amazing film. I hope that those who have written Mel Gibson off for comments he made ten years ago, can look past that and judge the man's art and not the man himself because he truly made a masterpiece with this film and it not only stands as one of this year's finest films, but also shows that good movies can still be made these days and I hope this film takes off and not only inspires, but truly shows what a Hollywood production can still do in the proper hands and that they can still achieve greatness. One of this year's best films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hacksaw Ridge - review: A Gruesome Hallmark Movie,"Hacksaw Ridge is a great movie. The performances are superb. The directing is skillful. The storyline is handled with care, craftsmanship, and attention to detail. Nothing goes unnoticed here. Every little detail is gutted and then hung out to dry like a dead pig. This movie will grip you and then forcefully hold your eyelids open. If you want to see something intense, heartfelt, genuine, and meaningful, then hold onto your seats because this will take you on a ride.Andrew Garfield's performance was breathtaking. Vince Vaughn's performance was exceptional. At first, I thought that Mr. Vaughn would throw me off because I thought he looked odd being there. I've seen Vince Vaughn movies, and I don't take him that seriously when it comes to dramatic. Mel Gibson (the director) knows how to use his actors to the best of their abilities. Vaughn's performance was dynamic; his introduction was funny, but yet it was also serious. Mel Gibson played on Vaughn's strengths and skillfully crafted him as a character. Vince Vaughn's scenes really stood out in this movie. Teresa Palmer played her part with bravado. I was impressed by her performance because she could cry on cue. Palmer's character was firm and she stood her ground. Hugo Weaving stood out the most to me during the entire movie. His performance was gripping, mesmerizing, and he deserves an Academy Award.At times, the movie felt extremely cheesy. Picture a Hallmark movie but with gruesome violence, and that's what Hacksaw Ridge is. I couldn't stand the cheesiness for a while, but I grew to accept it because the interpersonal and internal dynamics from some of the characters were gripping.Mel Gibson knows how to craft a movie, and his sense of direction guided this along. At times the movie seemed bloated or exaggerated, for example, the war scenes seemed like they went on far too long, but there was a point within its context. You could say everything in here appeared to be glorified, but I could call that attention to detail. War is not pretty, war hurts, and this movie is as close as I ever want to get to it.Overall, I enjoyed Hacksaw Ridge, and I could say that it's now one of my favorite movies from 2016. If you want to see a Hallmark movie with gruesome violence, then sit back and strap up, and prepare yourself because I think this will surprise you. Audiences are in for a real treat with this one.Final Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An apt ode to the heroism of wartime medics,"Kudos to Mr.Gibson for making a stirring and heroic film about the incredible sacrifices of wartime medics in general and, more specifically, the amazing Mr. Doss during the WW II campaign on Okinawa. Andrew Garfield is fantastic in the lead role and the film pulls no punches with the harrowing and horrible ordeals of combat - and rightly so. The movie does get a little heavy-handed at times and the slow motion effects are slightly overdone, but these are minor quibbles. The special and visual effects are impressively done and the cast performs admirably. It all adds up to being one of the best films of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
completely exhilarating,"This is an example of a truly remarkable war film, with brutal uncompromising action, great cinematography, and phenomenal characters. The pacing is perfect, starting off slow and then quickly dropping you into the action. It is also emotionally moving and intense. This is the prime example of how to make a movie with religious themes, without beating you over the head with them. Its a story about perseverance and faith, but the faith aspect is told in an expertly subtle way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hacksaw Ridge is brutal yet one of the best war films in a long time.,"It's been ten years since Mel Gibson made those alleged anti-Semitic remarks. That's about the same time Gibson has been looking for work as a director in Hollywood. But hypothetically speaking, if Gibson were to throw down the gauntlet against the likes of Spielberg, this is how one would imagine him doing it.Hacksaw Ridge is not only Gibson's best film since Braveheart, it is also the best war film since Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. As an actor and a director, Gibson's symbiosis with cinema has almost always been about self-sacrifice and patriotism. In that tradition, Hacksaw Ridge is one of the most moving films on heroism and the second reason why this film is a must-see. Despite countless films on World War II, this is an original yet true story that has never been told before. Comprising of an ensemble cast, the film opens over the vistas of Blue Ridge Mountains, Virginia, where we are first introduced to Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) and the estranged relationship with his alcoholic and WWI veteran father Tom (Hugo Weaving). It's a pivotal part of the story that would ultimately determine the decisions Doss would make after enlisting in the war. This is also where Doss falls head over heels for local nurse Dorothy (Teresa Palmer) and promises to marry her as soon as he returns. All this feels a little clichéd, and given the setting, a bit like the love story in Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor.The next part is the boot camp segment and essentially where the narrative kicks in some humour, ala R. Lee Ermy styled commanding officer played by Vince Vaughn. Doss is immediately branded a coward for refusing to touch a rifle. Not even platoon Captain Glover's (Sam Worthington) discriminatory threats will smudge Doss' belief in never taking a life. This only means that Doss must work harder and disprove his CO's ranting that ""a unit is only as strong as its weakest member"". As an unlikely soldier, what Doss manages to do during the rest of the film is absolutely incredible but not before Gibson is let loose with a ravenous appetite for violence.We've seen what Gibson did to the character of Jesus in The Passion of the Christ, and going by that reputation, this should come as a fair warning for the queasy that there is no shortage of gore, guts, and severed limbs in this film. In taking the fight to blood soaked trenches in Okinawa, it suddenly dawns on the audience how and why the word 'Hacksaw' was coined in Japanese territory. Even so, carnage although graphic is somehow poetic and a first for Gibson. That's largely due to the seasoned cast and the attention given when they are introduced, resulting in ample reason to root for them. Led by the charismatic Garfield, each character is sympathetic, brave and sometimes even funny which gives Gibson's broad strokes an emotional undertone when we see them getting picked off before knowing what hit them.Many will tout this film as Mel Gibson's comeback vehicle. While this may be partly true, the film in its entirety is a well-crafted ode to selfless courage infused with reverence for divinity. For what has mostly been a bad year in cinema, 2016 seems to be sprouting, albeit late in the year but closer to Oscar season, with films devoted to real life heroes. Sully was one of them. If Desmond Doss was eventually venerated with the Congressional medal of Honour and all without firing a single bullet, Hacksaw Ridge could prove to be Gibson's atonement in as much as his return to form.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A hero without superpowers,"Mel Gibson is back! And not in front of the screen but behind it! And we already know that what he does with the camera sometimes is way better than his performances and this film is a perfect example of it.The story that the film is based on is an interesting if not hard to believe story, but it did really happen. Having a good story to make a movie about does not mean that the movie is going to be a good movie, is not the case of this one, as it is indeed a great movie. The story is brilliantly told, we see the evolution of the main character, his childhood, his preparation for war and the point of it all, when he is at war, what he does, how he does it and at some point we learn why he does all this no weapon thing.The camera follows the main actor, Andrew Garfield, wherever he goes. It's a smooth movement that keeps us attached to the main character. Andrew does a fantastic work in this movie, which proves that he is an actor with potential so it looks like that we will hear more from him (and that he has obtained an Oscar nomination for this role just proves it).At some point you will smell in the air a big of ""Saving Private Ryan"", because it is how it is made, but instead of somebody trying to find a private and to rescue him, in here is the private who is doing all the rescuing, which is simply impressive when you think it really happened, maybe not that way exactly, but it doesn't make it less incredible.An entertaining movie where you will learn what a real hero is without the need of special powers or spandex outfits. Because heroes really exist and here is an example to learn about one of them while being entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Save your money,This movie is awful. If you like believability don't watch this 120 pound guy carry guys twice his weight while being shot at. He's kicking grenades like a ninja.

This is a highly overrated film that isn't worth the time to watch it.,1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of my favorite movies that I have seen....,"Hacksaw Ridge Ridge is, according to the actual main Character Doss's son, very close to 100% factual. The main character is a very spiritual man from a spiritual family that takes ""Thy Shall Not Kill"" in the bible literally.He ends up in a very very real war. My hands were shaking and heart pounding for two hours of the 2 1/2 hours of the movie. The movie portrays well why so many American lost their lives in Okinawa (WWII).Doss was an incredible man. I think that he is the only Conscientious Objector to win a Purple Heart for bravery in battle and he didn't even carry a gun.All of this aside, the movie is really about humanity and God's love for us in the face of horrific tragedy. It's a hard movie but yet beautiful. It's about values, commitment, respect and love for fellow humans as well.It's a wonderful movie that I highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Courage and being brave becoming a hero in a different way.,"Plenty of movies are made about war and a lot has been written about War War II especially, this picture directed by Mel Gibson called ""Hacksaw Ridge"" looks at a different kind of hero from the time period. It's the true story of Desmond Doss(in a strong performance from Andrew Garfield)a medic and self proclaimed pacifist who won a Medal of Honor without ever even using a weapon. And this film is in detail showing the rural life that Desmond lived in Virginia growing up. As he becomes a man he has a pure romance with a young nurse all while maintaining his faith in Sunday, and after going in service to fight in Okinawa, Japan Desmond and others experience hell on the battlefield as this film is very graphic with bullets, blood, bombings, and partial body parts of death all caused by war. Thru it all it takes extra courage for this man who went a different path of being brave to become a hero to be remembered. Really this picture makes one feel the glory of courage with red, white, and blue honor as it's thru love and compassion of others that made Doss a man who will be remembered as the greatest helper never to have packed a weapon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
'Help me get one more.',"Seeing and experiencing films such as HACKSAW RIDGE during Memorial Day is a strong reminder of the honor we owe to the men and women who have fought to protect us. Though wars continue, around the globe and within our strife-ridden country, the horror of war is ever present, but the courage and sacrifice veterans have made and continue to make deserve our honor.HACKSAW RIDGE is a very fine film about the battle of WW II on Okinawa as written for the screen by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight and direct with great sensitivity by Mel Gibson. This, as we all know, is a true story of a young conscientious objector Desmond Doss (Darcy Bryce/Andrew Garfield) who entered training for WW II having had a terrifying experience as a child with his brother Hal (Roman Guerriero/Nathaniel Buzolic), enduring the PTSD alcoholic father (a brilliant performance from Hugo Weaving), growing up as a 7th Day Adventist, and how he adjusts to military life in training, nears court marshal because of his refusal to carry a gun, and ends up in Okinawa where unarmed he save the lives of 75 fellow GIs. Thankfully the script allows the first half of the film show the character development of Desmond, introducing the men in his company (Luke Pegler, Luke Bracey, Nico Cortez, Farass Dirani, Jim Robison, Goran D. Klet, Damien Thomlinson, Sam Worthington, a brilliant Vince Vaughan, and more), and Desmond's love interest (Teresa Palmer) and his mother (Rachel Griffiths).The fighting action is brilliantly depicted and well photographed by Simon Duggan – and of course directed by Gibson. Rupert Gregson-Williams supplies the very appropriate musical score. The film is violent to watch: war is violent to watch. The message of Desmond Doss's honor is underlined by images at the end of the film. This is a very fine film – particularly on Memorial Day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mel Gibson is a genius,"A masterpiece directed by Mel Gibson, all the scenes are Amazing incredibly directed the actors are Amazing too all in this movie is a jewel including the photography and the music this film is the most impressive War movie that I have never seen in my all life mixing the religion too I think that this movie is really intellectual and philosophical it's a film about the humanity the stupidity of the war and god it remains the traumatic side of the War and the love of god the first is a little bit wise but the second part is truly Amazing it's really violent it shows the War so it's like that but it's really well made the camera the HD is amazing when I leave the cinema I was like changed Thanks Mr Gibson to have made this incredible movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
It feels like a movie,"Everyone is saying it is a great produced war movie. First of all, a considerable part of the story takes place at the protagonist life before he went to war and, honestly, I think this is the best part. We have great comic events on the army training. Then we see the war we were waiting and yes, the wounds are very realistic and you do have to have stomach to watch. But still it looked like a movie. If I had to tell one reason I would say the camera movements and takes. All we see is the common beautiful shots we are used to. Everything is so clean that at the end the protagonist's hair remains untouchable. The script does not surprises us as well. The dialogues are simple and it leaves the impression that the movie is too anxious to get to the war as fast as possible. At the end we see it taking the side of religion and exalting the hero. I do think Desmond Doss is a hero but I do not think we should say what he did was a good thing. What he did was madness and he was very lucky to came out alive. The performances are very impressive especially Andrew Garfield's. To conclude, if you enjoy a good war movie this is the right way to go. If you don't, it does not worth to see too much blood for a weak plot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Mel is back, in style!!!!","Hacksaw Ridge (2016) This is one of the best movies of the year, if not the best.Don't get me wrong, this movie is not flawless, but Mel knows how to strike it, first in choosing a story, religious and patriotic, that really fits him. Then he knows how to create atmosphere so the whole movie looks somehow big, epic etc. Film is nicely put in two parts,first part is more of a drama and second part is war with drops of drama and thriller. Maybe the weakest part of the movie is that last sequence, that is generally low point of biography movies, when hero feels little unrealistic. Maybe I'm little bothered by Mel's one sided story, but that is a big plus also, he doesn't try to please audience, but himself. He was like that in Braveheart too.When it comes to actors, role of Vince Vaugh as Sergent Howell was fantastic, he was bringing balance to the story and toning it down a little, which is good thing in this movie. Andrew Garfiled is good and he is developing in a very good actor. Teresa Palmer was great in her role of Doss' girlfriend, she and Garfield really shine together.Conclusion: Very good war or anti-war movie depends how you see it, just a little weaker than already mentioned Bravheart, it's 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Desmond Doss: American Hero,"Hacksaw Ridge is Mel Gibson's comeback film. After half of a decade of banishment from Hollywood following a string of leaked audio tapes revealing Gibson to use violent, racist and anti- semitic language, it appears that he has been absolved of his sins by the Hollywood elite, and has been given one more shot at success. He comes back to silver screen as a director, with a film many have placed into the category of conservative-freindy films. Films like American Sniper, 13 Hours and Patriots Day, that play extremely well with audiences across America and provide soaring box-office returns, but are scoffed at by films critics as being cliché, jingoist, patriarchal.. you name the buzz word. But perhaps Hacksaw Ridge finally bridges the gap between the film snobs, and the filmgoers. No, Hacksaw Ridge is not a movie only a Trump supporter would love. It tells a heartbreaking, inspiring story of courage, faith and unwavering love for humanity.Desmond Doss is a man many Americans strive to be, and quite frankly, fail. He's a man of deep faith, who enlists in the army to fight the Japanese in WWII. He would be the ideal marine, except for one thing.. he refused to pick up a gun. Desmond is the ultimate pacifist. His religion teaches him never to kill, even on the battlefield. To the chagrin of his division, he is demoted as a combat medic.The story unravels slowly, as we see Desmond in times before the war romancing a young southern belle played by the stunning Teresa Palmer. As well as his problems at home with his alcoholic, WWI vet father, provided by a tremendous performance by Hugo Weaving. Comedian Vince Vaughn appears as the drill sergeant, who brings his quick wit to this drama, and does a fabulous job. The sweet moments of the film's beginning seem sort of cheesy. But then, Desmond leaves for the war and with an anaconda grip, you are sucked into his hell on earth.We are taken to Okinawa, and the carnage begins. Hacksaw Ridge is by far the most violent film of the year. It's a war film that is unafraid of showing all of the blood and guts. You'll be taken completely aback as it begins. Heads get split open, torsos get cut in half, legs are blown apart. The nastiest aspects on this horrible war are on full display, but perhaps more disturbing of all, is the shell shocked Desmond, who fights with all of his might to do his job, and save his fellow men. One by one, he fills them with morphine and takes them back to the base. ""Lord, give me one more"" he chants to himself. Desmond Doss is an unmistakable American hero. This is a moving picture. I hope that people can still be moved by a picture like this, but in this divisive climate, it is hard to say if that is even possible. As of this moment, we have never been farther apart, and we have never been more cynical as a country. But what we know far too well, is that we must honor the brave men that came before us that died protecting us. We enjoy our lives on the graves of men like Desmond Doss, who risked his life and his dignity saving us from the evils of fascism. His story is one that we desperately needed to hear from.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Well worth watching,"Didn't go in with high expectations as I am not a fan of war movies. I went because my husband wished to see it. I had heard it was bloody which was true in part. The battle scenes are confronting but I suspect quite realistic. How any soldier retained sanity after WW11 is a mystery. This movie engaged me from the beginning. Andrew Garfield played the role perfectly capturing a sense of strength, confusion and dignity mixed up with boyish charm. He was a fully rounded real person that perhaps confounds one but the strength of his conviction is compelling. This is a true story of a real hero. I was left in awe of his humbleness yet greatness. This is the sort of person we should hold up to our kids to emulate, rather than a Kardashian and their ilk. It was great to see so many Australian actors in the various cameo and supporting roles. All did a stellar job except perhaps Sam Worthington's American accent which kept slipping. Vincent Vaughan has such presence. I enjoyed his performance greatly. Kudos to Mel Gibson in bringing us yet another morality tale of such quality. Another man struggling to retain his convictions against a punishing establishment . Finely crafted. Well worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""One more! Help me get one more!""","""Hacksaw Ridge"" (2016 release; 131 min.) is ""a true story"", as we are reminded at the beginning of the movie, of conscientious objector Desmond Doss and his incredible heroism in WWII. As the movie opens, we are right in the middle of the battle of Okinawa, with bodies flying left and right, and in slow-motion. We then shift back to ""Blue Ridge Mountains, Virginia"", where we get to know your Desmond and his little brother, along with their deeply religious parents. One day, during a fight with his brother, Desmond hits in in the head with a stone, almost killing him. Then we go ""Fifteen Years Later"" , as America is getting ready for WWII. At this point we're 10-15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is directed by none other than Mel Gibson, making a return from 10 years in Hollywood wilderness. Gibson has been a pariah, and whether that is justified or not, I will leave to others to discuss. One thing is clear, though: the man knows how to make a movie. Here, he finds a combination that suits him just perfectly: religion and violence. The first part of the movie shows us what Doss as a conscientious objector had to endure simply to be able to serve his country, while the second part gives us the Battle of Okinawa in May '45. The parallels between this movie and Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" are obvious. Beware, the battle scenes in ""Hacksaw Ridge"" are extensive, and leave nothing to the imagination, making this latest Gibson movie ""bloody good"". The heroism of Doss is nothing short of awe-inducing, and humbling. With each life saved, and running on fumes, Doss keeps praying ""one more! help me get one more!"", wow, just wow. How it is that this man's story hasn't been made into a movie sooner, I have no idea, but better late than never. At the very end of the movie there are a couple of clips, showing Doss accepting the Medal of Honor (the first conscientious objector to do so), and also being interviewed in 2003. Andrew Garfield is outstanding as Doss. This movie feels like it was made in another era, and I mean that as a compliment. Kudos to Gibson and the overall production team for a job well done.""Hacksaw Ridge"" opened this weekend, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati, was pretty close to a sell-out. I think this movie is going to have long legs in the theater as word-of-mouth gets around about this ""Saving Private Ryan""-reminding and overall feel-good if tough WWII drama. If you liked ""Saving Private Ryan"", you will not want to miss this, preferably in the theater as this is the type of epic movie that will lose some of its effectiveness on Amazon Instant Video or DVD/Blu-ray. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Kind of dissapointing,"This movie had amazing potential, but went too far from the story to call it a good documentation of his life. As a stand alone film, it's a solid 8, with the second part leaning on a 9, but the documentation is a 4. Missed the whole part where he earnt his commrades respect was completely ignored and the first half was just a bunch of hollywoodcrap. Instead of acknowledging the bible, they went ofroad and added that part with him hurting his brother. And don't get me started about that forced love story. And all that family stuff is thrown out a window in the second half, instead giving more room for what actually mattered in his life: Christianity. Again, i'm judging the film, not the documentation, and they nailed that 100%",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fantastic.,"Mel Gibson is in my eyes a very talented director and this movie is a great example for my opinion. I liked this movie a lot and it surprised me in many ways.I actually liked this movie so much, that i can consider talking about it in the same sentence as i would talk about Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now. It may not be in the same level as those movies are, but it's in there. You cannot close Hacksaw Ridge out of the conversation when you talk about the best war movies of all time.Apocalypse Now is in my eyes the best war movie ever and probably will always be. Full Metal Jacket in the other hand has a lot of other things that make it incredible. Hacksaw Ridge has a little bit of both that those incredible movies have.Vince Vaughn surprised me in this movie. Since he did not suck as bad as i first thought he would. He sure is not R.Lee Ermey and he never will be. To be quite honest, no on will. Ever. But he did okay in this one and i have nothing bad to say about him.So let's talk about the war scenes. I have heard a lot of criticism about them, but i found them actually very well done. I liked them a lot. I liked them so much, that only because of them i could say that this was the best movie of year and deserves an Oscar. Sure it's not only about them, but they were a real highlight in the movie with the incredible score.Great story. I had no idea that it was based on a true story and that only blows me away. Amazing.

To see a really great group of movies on the Pacific War, Flags of our Fathers/ Letters from Iwo Jima are wonderfully shot, realistic in their portrayal of combat, and the dialogue is far, far better.Did I mention that Vince Vaughn is a terrible actor, and should only stick to comedy?",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A remarkable person and this film did him and his incredible story justice!,"I put off watching this film for so long!I ignored friends and reviews when they were all raving about it, telling me to give it a chance but me being me, thought I knew better.I predicted another generic WWII film, with tired battle sequences and little focus on story or character development, and when I saw Mel Gibson was directing it? Well that was the icing on the cake!Guys I was so wrong, this film is completely inspiring and moved me in a way that I hadn't been moved in a long time. (Bearing in mind I saw this before I saw Logan)The film itself is based on true events involving the life of Desmond Doss – a name I was unfamiliar with before I saw this.Our hero enlists into the army during WW2, but his own religious beliefs restrict him from committing murder, which kinda sucks if you're strolling out onto the battlefield.You can imagine that this isn't the greatest news the US army want to hear, but try as they might, Doss sticks around and off he trots to fight for his country.As I always strive to steer clear of spoilers, I'm going to leave out all the juicy details, but Desmond really is an unlikely hero who proves his peers wrong throughout the film and teaches us all a thing or two about sticking to your guns (pun intended) and not turning your back on what you believe, even if 'the man' tells you to.I really loved the way the film builds a back story for our main character and makes us really understand why he feels how he feels.My only criticism is the rushed love story at the beginning of the film. It shows us how he met his future baby mama and their budding romance pre-war.Although it did pay a role in how the following events unfolded, I didn't really feeeel it – it felt a little lacklustre and a whole lotta cringe.Those few scenes aside, this is an exceptional film that depicts perfectly the fear and bravery that those army folk displayed.It also was a nice reminder that we may only be one but we have the ability to effect the lives of many – yay humans!Something else worth mentioning is this isn't for the light hearted, if you're not into blood, gore and a whole lot of limb dismemberment then beware!I am not easily squeamish but boy oh boy this had me 'eeeking' a fair few times.Moving swiftly onto the rating, it's a strong 8/10 from me, VERY nearly a 9/10.When I finished the movie I immediately went home and read up a little more about Desmond doss himself and he was a remarkable person and this film did him and his incredible story justice!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Courage of both Doss and his mates,"Mel Gibson is a great storyteller and here is telling a story worth being told. Being brought up on a diet of the Lone Ranger, Tarzan, Superman, etc where the hero steadfastly fights for justice for all, I do love stories about courageous people and especially ones where the good guys win. Hacksaw Ridge tells just such a story and most wonderfully it is true. Doss goes through his own personal battle of holding on to what he believes no matter the treatment he receives from both his fellow soldiers as well as the army commanders. He could have so easily given in but was determined to find a way of helping others, something he achieves in spades. But it is also a movie that reveals the courage of all the soldiers who fight in wars. How did these men find the guts to scale that cliff and face the barrage of bullets they knew were coming, how does anyone do that? Wonderfully acted and filmed. I admit to having grave fears about Garfield being capable of portraying Doss but wow he pulled it off so very well. I hope the movie wins awards galore because it is actually something worthwhile spending time and money on. Well done everyone involved in this, I'd be at the movies more often if there were more like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Gibson has made a superb war film. Even Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington are great in this!,"Say what you will about Mel Gibson - because much can be said and much has been said - but at the end of the day, he is an undeniably talented filmmaker. Even his most flawed films, like ""The Passion,"" are ambitious and hard to ignore. He isn't someone who rests on his laurels or takes paycheck gigs, and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is imprinted with as much of his DNA as a filmmaker as any of his other movies.Combining the visceral nature (as well as the literal viscera) of ""Apocalypto"" and ""Passion"" with the grandeur storytelling of ""Braveheart,"" this true story is without a doubt a movie riddled with issues: the first half, though compelling and with fine performances, does at times border on the sentimentally hamstringed and predictable.And yet it works, mostly because of the performances and the direction. I read a review stating that everyone in this film was miscast; I couldn't disagree more -- this is a fine example of how perfect a cast can be. Andrew Garfield is exceptional and deserves an Oscar nomination. Teresa Palmer does the best she can with a relatively one-note love interest; she manages to actually make the character stand out more than on paper.Hugo Weaving gives perhaps the finest performance of his career, another award-worthy supporting turn as Desmond's father. But the real surprises here are the straight-to-video actors who usually seem devoid of charisma: Sam Worthington does career-best work here, while Luke Bracey, the nobody actor from the ""Point Break"" remake that no one asked for, is memorable as a stoic soldier whose skepticism of Desmond gradually evolves as the film progresses.Finally, there is the revelation of Vince Vaughn's drill sergeant, who already ranks up there with R. Lee Ermey (if that sounds hyperbolic, it really is that fine of a performance). After his failed comeback with True Detective's miserable second season, and bomb after comedy bomb, it's nice to see him returning to his roots as a character actor. He's simply great here.At the end of the day this is likely to be overlooked at awards season simply given Gibson's baggage and the unfortunate shadow it casts over his work, but my hope is that voters will be able to see past that and approach the film on its own terms. It features some of the most gruesome and unforgettable war scenes ever captured on film, and yet none of it seems particularly excessive or undeserved: to really appreciate the sacrifice and the heroism that the real Desmond displayed in battle, you almost have to be thrown right into the worst of it to be able to place it in a proper context. This is not ""Enemy at the Gates"" or ""Behind Enemy Lines."" Mel Gibson has made one of the best war films of all time, and he, Garfield and at least two of his supporting actors all deserve recognition for this come Oscar season.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best movie of 2016,"I first saw Hacksaw Ridge, back in November when it first came out.. Went to an afternoon screening and it was packed. From the very first scene to the last , I was in awe. This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. The last 30 minutes of the film, I had tears rolling down my cheeks. After it ended, it got a standing ovation. Braveheart is my all time favourite movie and have seen it over 200 times., but this might just be my new favourite movie. I have seen it 6 times now, and cried every time. It is such an emotional film. The story of the HERO Desmond Doss is truly inspiring.Thank you Mel Gibson and Desmond Doss Jr. for letting us know more about this remarkable man. Hugo Weaving was robbed of an Oscar nomination.. Andrew Garfield blew my away with his performance., and it is Vince Vaughn's best performance as well. It is the best film of 2016.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Wonderfully done,"I don't have enough words to praise this movie with and it's not about the gore or the sound effects. It is about Doss and his incredible strength of will. I doubt another cast could have even touched on the amount of emotion and powerful performances as well as this one. No one was wrongly casted, in fact the very opposite. I've hesitated watching anything attached to Mel Gibson but his character and person has nothing to do with his professional life and abilities and this one sure did shine. Why are there not more stories of these unbelievable men, and I'm sure there are plenty of them? I will watch this movie each and every time it is ever repeated on a cable channel and only wish I would have seen it in a theater. It will stay with you long after the last credit has rolled by.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Good, not great","Hacksaw Ridge is a solid war film. It portrays the horrors of war, the chaos, the blood, the hopelessness and futility of it all. Its also shows the story of a man of principle who wanted to serve despite a misalignment of those principles and the army he joined. It looks mostly good, the acting is solid and the script mostly good too.Gibson is a good director but he does have a few blind spots. Hawksaw has a number of them.First of all there's a fine line between moving and cheesy. On a number of occasions HR goes from good war film to cheesy war film. The action becomes a bit silly, the behaviour of the players cartoonish, the portrayal of combat too staged and convenient to the story. Soldiers are crazy brave, like stupid brave, they bunch up contrary to the most basic military doctrines. The Japanese are silly villains without humanity who behave on the battlefield to serve the story little else; they are dumb, conveniently break cover to be shot or flame throwered, infact line up to be on the recieving end.The first half is also a bit frought as the love story is just a bit too perfect, Doss and his wife to be are just a little bit much, their story feels contrived.Gibson's other flaw is religion. He has a strong tendency to want to not just show his characters as religious but to be pushing it a bit much. Its central to Doss' motivation, I get that, but damn does Gibson lay it on thick. A soldier runs to Doss to give him his dropped bible after he's wounded, the whole company waits while he prays, as a child he stares intently at a 10 commandments cross stitch.... and more. I suspect it would be more effective if it was more subtle and nuanced.In saying all that I did find the film genuinely moving at times and despite its flaws its solid. However people saying this is 'the greatest war film ever' have got it more than a little wrong (see Saving Private Ryan, Deer Hunter, Glory, Platoon, Das Boot and. Come and See - all superior by some margin)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lovely and Brutal,"Oh, the return of Mel Gibson. It should have a train wreck, right? Somehow it was not, and this might be the best directed movie he has ever done. Andrew Garfield plays a pacifist character stuck in a war he must fight with a heart that is beyond pure for a cause that is sublimely patriotic against an enemy that is pure evil, in the face of adversity of his peers. Yes, that could also be the plot synopsis of Braveheart or Passion of the Christ. Luckily, the movie is a visual feast for those who enjoy an engaging war story with a perfectly paced first act build up that has perfect pay offs in the finale. A true story to boot, and one of my favorite WW2 movies when all is said and done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mixed feelings...,"...Stunning in so many rights, but unnecessarily historically inaccurate in many others. While not a documentary, any film which takes on the mantle of re-creating a true story on screen (especially one about war) should, in my opinion, feel compelled to pay attention to detail. Some brief research online suggests this wasn't the case. I also think one-sided war films are a dangerous way to stir nationalistic views to modern audiences. I'd have much preferred to see both sides tales somewhat represented. In saying this, the very fact that this memorable film brings the story of one man's conviction in his faith leading to him saving 75 lives, deserves immense respect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

One of the Best Movies in My Recent Memory,"Mel Gibson is BACK as a director!Hacksaw Ridge was one of the most profoundly moving movies I have seen in a very long time.Also, I am very glad to see Andrew Garfield back. He portrayed Private Desmond Doss with a lot of verve and enormous heart. He did great with Spiderman, but no one could have ever guessed he could be this good. Garfield is in possession of some serious acting chops!Other cast members deserve attention, too: Sam Worthington comes back from a very successful role in Avatar, to play a convincing and heartfelt Captain Glover in this movie. There was also Hugo Weaving; I never would have guessed he would have been able to play a grieving, alcoholic Virginia blue collar father. But he did. One may be given to think of him as only these ostentatious supporting characters, but see him in Hacksaw Ridge, and you'll believe he can play anything too.Gave this film 10 out of 10. Hacksaw Ridge, from beginning to end, was an absolutely superb movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A film that reminds you to respect the sacrifices of so many.,"This movie is one of the greatest war films I have ever seen. It is real, raw, and is definitely not for those who can't handle blood! Its lack of swearing is unique to this genre, but the brutality of some of the scenery makes up for the missing profanity. It puts you in the heart of someone's moral struggle of wanting to help, but being unwilling to submit to changing one's self. It makes you think about where you personally stand on issues, while causing you to reflect on the history of America and the very real battles we faced. It makes you respect those who have come before us all, and what their families and love ones have overcome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

It has to be the best WW2 movie since ""Saving Private Ryan"" - it is that good.Andrew Garfield was absolutely stunning Desmond Doss, a true hero who saved many lives in one of the bloodiest conflicts during the Battle of Okinawa. Brilliant as usual Mel Gibson pulled no punches during battle sequences, they are as brutal as I've never saw since, well ""Saving Private Ryan"" again. This is a one bloody, gory, visceral experience. Yet it isn't only about blood and guts. It is about heroes who did incredible things during unimaginable events.Overall, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a pure movie experience.

Most critics who are obviously agnostic or atheist, seem to want to obsess on the main characters religious values. Meanwhile,you don't even see them as being relevant to the story at all.

"One of the best war movies I've seen, with a great message.","It's been a while since I've seen saving private Ryan, the movie I could not help but to compare this movie too, but the Spielberg movie is said to have some of the most realistic war scenes put on camera, and I must say Hacksaw Ridge is a huge rival to that.Some of the action in this movie is very over dramatic making it hard to believe that that happen but knowing how crazy war is I'm sure a lot of it did.Especially keeping with the story arch about a man who said I cannot kill another man or hold a gun in combat but had the courage to go to war and be a hero hands down.Andrew Garfield was good in the movie, but Vince Vaughn was a little iffy for me. Not that he was not good but he was not that convincing of a drill Sargent, but he was humorous, and it's a humor that really adds to the story. Hugo waving was just OK too.But man was this a great war epic. Top notch right there in the battle.

But, Mel did a good job with it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hacksaw Ridge #OscarNoms,"I am so glad to see Mel Gibson back to directing movies because ever since The Man Without a Face he has made many very good movies, among which my favourite has to be Braveheart, being an incredible film as well as Apocalypto, which is just as good. This time around, at the heart of this cinematic cyclone is a more conventional character study; of a man torn by his need to serve in a fight against Japan and a strict moral code that prevents him from taking life. Though, once on the battlefield the complexities of his moral fall away, replaced by the simple maths of saving lives.Andrew Garfield, former Spidey, is so good at being an optimist in life, he has this infectious smile, he seems to be such a sweet guy and you really root for his character. Garfield is the warm anchor the film needs. Between this film and Silence, two contrasting tales of faith in an unforgiving world, any memories of the sad end to his web-slinging days should be well and truly banished. Teresa Palmer gives also the best performance of her entire career, as a nurse who Desmond meets, they get to know each other and their relationship is genuinely sweet and charming.Vince Vaughn is in this movie and stole every scene he's in, as an aggressive motor mouth drill instructor. That casting choice is a reminder that Vince Vaughn is obviously very funny, but he also has some dramatic arcs. Moreover, Hugo Weaving gives one of the best performances in this film and I am so happy to see him again. I haven't seen him in a movie in a long time. He is always great, as his legendary roles can attest: Smith, Elrond, Red Skull or in V for Vendetta; this is what we love him for. In this film, he gives such a harden and emotionally powerful performance, as a man who has to deal with alcoholism. I am blown away by his work here.The slow-burn promise of the film's opening acts pays off in a fierce focus on characters we have come to know, from all of the above to Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey. Biblical themes resonate and Doss's faith and certainties are tested in the movie's second act, a shift happens from home-baked heaven to the purgatory of military training. Mel Gibson and his scribes: Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan's grip on a familiar material is firm; their images, motifs and structures lend purpose to a potentially cheesy material.The combat sequences, set on a blasted, blood-soaked Okinawan ridge in 1945, are filmed in Viscera Vision - they blaze and roar with the expression of pure violence. At some point, Mel Gibson leads us up a cliff and into a Bosch-ian nightmare. Between the mud, splayed bodies, bullet-pierced tin hats and torsos used as shields; the Battle of Okinawa pulverises. War has been hell in movies before, this is worse. What is impressive here, is how Gibson pushes his direction beyond the exploitative possibilities of raising hell.The war scenes are brutally realistic and you can see that nothing has been held back and they are very well done and not romanticised at all. This happened. This sucked and this is the story of a man who tried to do something good. This is effectively shocking. Finally, you don't need to be a religious person to appreciate the movie. It addresses strong perspective for the character but you don't need to be religious to appreciate the spirit of this film, and the eternal truth that Human spirit is the most powerful thing you can have.Overall, Hacksaw Ridge is an old-fashioned story that Mel Gibson mainlines with bleeding-edge craft and technique - he has lost little of his knack for spectacle and has proved once again that he is a master behind the camera.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hacksaw Ridge,"Hacksaw Ridge is a engaging story, well directed and most of all well acted and paced. The story keeps you hooked and whilst it starts a little slow it gets its footing right later on.Directing is a bit two faced for me, as much as I like it. The first section of the movie is really strong, the war sequences suffer from being a lot messier than you'd like. Now the argument is to be made that it's chaos, but when it's just a whole lot of scenes mashed together with it and the constant blowing up of people the impact starts to wither. The use of slow-motion didn't help either, slow motion is a tricky thing because it can be really effective IF used sparingly and with intent. But here most of the slow motion scenes seem to have been used to ''clear the lens'' and show off the explosions. Which for me messed with the intensity.About intensity, this is a really ''soft'' war movie in terms of sound design. If there's any genre that needs good sound design its the war genre and I think it's not very strong here. It felt underexposed, only the plink of the helmets was notable, the rest just kind of mushed together. Impact was missing. This comes to VFX as well, the blood splats were done almost exclusively with VFX that just didn't sit 100% right. Wish it was more practical as it just works better atm.Story is inspiration no doubt, and it's a story that deserves a movie like this and I think they did it justice, inaccuracies/freedoms aside. That said the basic training sections felt somewhat weak. The side characters also never felt like they really had a chance to define themselves. Staying somewhat in their own little world. Smitty was the only standout. That said all in all a decent war movie with a story worth telling.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"This is a fantastic movie that I highly recommend and I can see why it's up for Best Picture, but not at Private Ryan level.","""I don't know how I'm gonna live with myself if I don't stay true to what I believe."" Desmond T. Doss (Garfield) has joined the Army. He wishes, more than anything, to serve his country in battle by becoming an Army medic. When his intentions to not carry a rifle are announced his entire company sees him as a coward and is put up for Court Marshall. After fighting the charge with everything he has Doss is allowed to serve, and becomes the first soldier in history to receive the Medal of Honorall without firing a single shot. This is a wonderful movie. The fact that it's true really helps the message and enjoyment of it, not to mention the acting by Garfield. This is a story that needed to be told, especially in today's climate and one that is worth watching, and must be seen. All that said I don't think this movie quite gets to the level of Saving Private Ryan or We Were Soldiers, but it is still one of the better war movies I have ever seen. The emotion and story of this one is what really makes it great and worth seeing.

"There have probably been worse films released this year, but I've not seen any of them.","Remember before Private Ryan, when war films were all gung-ho, shooting from the hip, and an inspiring speech was the answer to everything? Hacksaw Ridge is a throwback to those dark days. It's like Mel watched Private Ryan and Band Of Brothers and liked some parts, but didn't really understand the whole, so just stole the best bits without realising that things only work as a whole. It's so stupid that it feels like you're watching a load of kids playing soldiers, it doesn't feel like a glimpse of war. And all that military jargon that was well researched and difficult to understand, like when they come under fire, ""Over there, those bunkers"", or when the sarge gets on the radio to give the enemy position, ""they're straight ahead."" These gems sandwiched between about a dozen ""cover my/his/their/our ass/asses"", and the rather poetic, ""let's go to work"". Just as an example of how gung-ho silly it is, when they take the ridge, about half way through, and then the next morning the Japs counter charge, and hundreds of them pour out of their tunnel network, all the soldiers, who were all laying relatively safely in artillery their holes, and other appropriate cover where they couldn't be shot, all jumped out of them to start shooting at the attackers. Why? Because it might look good on camera. Kids playing soldiers. And yeah, the bit where he carries the upper half of that blokes body with one hand while hip shooting dozen or so Japs with his infinite ammo BAR (in fairness there wasn't a single reload throughout the entire film (no wonder the Americans won the war, they used hax)) was barmy, I just wish I could say it was the silliest thing about the film.Vince Vaughn has a good try at a Sgt Hartman impression though, but it wasn't enough to save the most disrespectful, idiotic film I've seen in a long time. This film portrays WW2 as accurately as working class school life was portrayed in Grange Hill.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Madcap film making at its best,"Hacksaw Ridge - 10/10 I was completely blown away by this film. Not only is the true story that it is based on utterly jaw dropping but it is tailor made to be adapted to the big screen. Mel Gibson is the perfect vehicle to tell this remarkable story in a visceral, no holds barred manner. Filmed in under 60 days, this is a triumphant return to the directors chair for Mel.The structure of the film is comparable to other great war movies such as Full Metal Jacket, where we start off at the boot camp and gradually progress to the 'hell on earth' of war. Gibson uses this structure to create a stark contrast between the light and the dark. The light being Desmond T. Doss's (Garfield) relationship with his girlfriend/wife being the light, the sequence on Hacksaw Ridge being the dark (or in this case the 'black').The first hour of the film is at times, a bit too nice. It is plastered with bright colors, sunshine, picturesque scenery and its fair share of romance. This reflects against the personality of Doss brilliantly with his more than moral principles.Whilst the majority of the first hour is a lot lighter than the rest of the film, it isn't without its gritty moments. Hugo Weaving puts in a solid performance as a drunk Veteran father who despite not having much screen time, has a fairly significant impact on the plot. We also have Vince Vaughan as a wise-cracking drill sergeant, who puts in a surprisingly capable performance (Into the Wild being one of few others).The sequence on Hacksaw ridge is harrowing and then some. This is relentless, disturbing, shocking and does not hold back. It takes what was achieved at the opening of Saving Private Ryan and amps everything up a few levels. This is madcap movie making at its best. Gibson felt that it was important to try and show people exactly what these veterans went through. In fact, some things that reportedly happened on the ridge were cut out as it was felt that the audience would find them to be too unbelievable.What Mr Doss went through that day is truly remarkable and this film demands to be seen by as wide an audience as possible. Some might find this film to be a little bit too patriotic and jingoistic, but that is almost unavoidable given the subject matter in question. How else do you portray an American hero without having a bit of flag waving? Perhaps some elements are slightly overcooked but a lot of that serves the purpose of amplifying the magnitude of Desmond T Doss's heroics.A career best from Andrew Garfield although I haven't yet seen Silence which I am assured is equally impressive. Mel Gibson's follow up to Apocalypto was more than worth the wait.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A True War Movie,I have never seen a movie that showed a simulated war that almost appeared like as if I was there along with the camera man fighting to get away from the bombs and bullets targeting at me. A very realistic and somewhat frightening experience. I was at the edge of my seat and so were the others. The director has put in hours of hard work and the hero was commendable. The actor and his family life prior to joining the war was as if vert true of a distorted ex army man's life. Very much realistic. No wonder this movie was rated so high. No other movie received such high ratings all year. If you like war movies then you must see this one.

The greatest anti-war movie of the last five years,"''Hacksaw Ridge'' is a superbly crafted anti-war movie and easily the best movie of its kind since the release of the South Korean war epic ''My Way'' five years earlier. This movie is based upon true events and tells the story of Seventh-day Adventist Desmond Thomas Doss who enlists in the Army to take part in the Second World War to defend his country but refuses to carry a gun due to his religious beliefs and negative experiences with his violent father who is a war veteran. In the beginning, Doss is bullied, criticized and rejected because of his convictions but he ends up gaining the respect of his brothers in arms during the crucial Battle of Okinawa where he saves the lives of seventy-five soldiers as a medic.The movie can basically be divided into three parts. The first part introduces Desmond Thomas Doss' life in Lynchburg, Virginia. It shows us how he almost killed his brother as a child because his fighting was encouraged by his broken, brutal and depressive father who is a war veteran of the First World War. It also shows us how his father abused of his wife and almost shot her. Desmond Thomas Doss had to fight his father to protect his mother and swore to never touch a gun again. It also shows us how he fell in love with a local nurse called Dorothy Schutte that he would later on marry. This part of the movie shows us a caring, peaceful and smart young man with clear and strong convictions.The second part of the film shows us how Desmond Thomas Doss enlists in the army. Initially, he convinces with good results during his training and gets along with most of his brothers in arms. It's only when he openly refuses to carry a gun that he gets rejected by his brothers in arms who are encouraged not to trust him or follow his actions by their superiors. Desmond Thomas Doss gets bullied both mentally and physically by his brothers in arms and has to face some time in prison as well as a trial for disobeying the orders of his superiors. In the end, the charges against him are dropped when a former commanding officer and brother in arms of his father states that Doss' refusal to carry a firearm is protected by the Constitution of the United States of America. This part of the movie shows us an authentic, honest and persevering individual that holds onto his beliefs despite all the hardship he endures.The third part of the movie takes places during the Battle of Okinawa at a place nicknamed Hacksaw Ridge. Doss' and his brothers in arms must take down the strategically placed Japanese forces atop a cliff. The battle turns out to be pitiless, long and brutal as losses are heavy on both sides. At night, Doss is the only non-injured American who remains on the battlefield to save as many injured soldiers as he can all by himself despite Japanese soldiers occupying the territory. This part of the movie shows us a brave, selfless and strong medic who risks his own life to save as many brothers in arms as possible.Aside of the inspiring story of a selfless medic, this movie convinces on many levels. The acting is authentic and emotional. Especially the main character portrayed by Andrew Garfield has a lot of sympathetic charisma. His father and war veteran portrayed by Hugo Weaving shows us a torn character who is brutal and depressive on one side but also honest and determined to help his son during his trial no matter what. Another great character is the main character's wife Dorothy Schutte played by Teresa Palmer who convinces as a selfless, faithful and elegant young woman who loves her husband for all the right reasons.Aside the extraordinary acting, one must point out the movie's epic cinematography. The costumes and settings are authentic and unpolished. The last third of the movie shows us quite brutal, graphic and gripping battle scenes that truly show us the horrors of war. These scenes are not gratuitous, melodramatic or overwhelming, they are just as close to reality as it gets. These intense scenes kept me on the edge of my seat. Another element I liked is the balance between wide shots to capture the horrors on the battlefield and the close-up to capture the emotions on the faces of the injured soldiers in the last forty-five minutes or so of the movie.To keep it short, ''Hacksaw Ridge'' is a memorable anti-war movie that convinces with an unusual, epic and detailed story line, outstanding acting performances and gorgeous cinematography. It's one of the best war movies in recent memory and also an outstanding drama at the same time. The only reason why this movie didn't get the highest rating is the fact that it focuses a little bit too much on the religious views of the main character. I'm aware of the fact that these beliefs are incredibly important to the main character but the movie felt a little bit repetitive, overwhelming and melodramatic concerning these elements that almost felt like religious propaganda at certain points.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

He also highlighted the Christian faith of the main character, doing so in an honorable way. The gore of battle was a little too graphic for me, and made it not viewable by my younger children.

The vision of every frame has been close to perfection on the photography aspect, then we have the amazing sound effects and the music that makes you feel totally immersed in the story, that I have to recognize it's great. I will recommend this movie to people who have watched ""Saving Private Ryan"" because it's a movie about valor, moral and principles and more important about the courage of doing the right thing in the right moment, if you like world war themed movies, this is the place to go to and enjoy the ride.

"Tribute to a real-life WW2 ""conscientious collaborator""","After Pearl Harbor, Desmond Doss of Lynchburg, Virginia, joins the US Army to become a medic and serves at the Battle of Okinawa. As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector, his goal was to save lives, not kill, which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers; until they observe his bravery in combat. Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss' potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant.Based on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" (2016) is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second. The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war. This is an interesting real-life tale that needs to be told and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroic element too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters, which makes them uninteresting. The latter is in contrast to the outstanding ""Platoon"" (1986) which featured several well-defined characters.The movie's about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence, even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense. He thinks this is supported by the Bible and, specifically, the New Testament, but it isn't. The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified. Christ' instructions to ""turn the cheek"" related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face, which was an insult in that culture. In other words, we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day. The Old Testament teaches this as well: ""A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult"" (Proverbs 12:16). So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense; he wasn't referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of one's nation.For proof, Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves/murderers in their travels. You see, Christ & his disciples weren't absolute pacifists. On two occasions, the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple - throwing over tables, swinging the whip and yelling. He was a Holy Terror, pure & simple, and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder (Mark 11:15-18). Harmless pacifists don't inspire fear and provoke murder plots. Moreover, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals, domestic & foreign, who threaten the lives of citizens. This includes the right to execute when appropriate. The majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists, like Doss in the movie, who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate. They're wrong. Sometimes it's necessary, like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, unprovoked, murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100.The film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in New South Wales, Australia.GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Mel Gibson merges a vision of the hell of war and great human heroism, and it's a masterpiece!","I had about as much interest in seeing a new film by Mel Gibson as I had in submitting to a root canal, but I found ""Hacksaw Ridge"" a complete revelation and one of the best films of the year.Gibson has had a scattered directorial career since winning the Oscar in 1995 for his second film: the entertaining if overrated ""Braveheart"". In the following two decades he managed to direct only the sadistic and overwrought ""Passion of the Christ"" in 2004 and his mystical visionary work, ""Apocalypto"" in 2006. And now, after a ten year hiatus, he's given us what seems likely to remain his crowning achievement, the deeply-felt true story of World War II army medic Desmond Doss (played by Andrew Garfield), the conscientious objector who earned the Medal of Honor by saving dozens of his fellow soldiers in the Battle of Okinawa while refusing to even hold a weapon. Although the violence in this film is the most explicit and shocking of any war film ever made (it truly makes the opening battle at Omaha Beach in Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" a playground fistfight by comparison), in context it's never gratuitous or offensive. The horrendous battle scenes never drive viewers out of the theater for two reasons, both important cinematic principles. First, in the film's first half Gibson gets viewers so emotionally involved with the main character, particularly with the relationship with his father (Hugo Weaving) as well as with the woman he loves (Teresa Palmer), audiences will easily accept the subsequent scenes of hell by caring so much. Secondly, Gibson portrays the battle scenes like great frescoes -- with bloodied, limbless bodies exploding and flying about within moving tapestries like peripheral details within a Bosch triptych. What makes this production more astonishing is that ""Hacksaw Ridge"" was an independent film produced on a relatively low budget, most of its battle scenes having been shot in New South Wales, Australia in an area not much larger than a football field.A noteworthy success on every technical level possible, with marvelous performances by the entire cast (most notably Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington), Gibson's achievement here is impossible to overrate. He has made not only one of the finest war films ever made, but also a cinematic chronicle that contrasts the bloodiest and most brutal acts of man's inhumanity to man with a profoundly moving, moralistic act of civilized human behavior amidst the worst hell of the human experience. This is a film not to miss.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A very unique war story,"Based on a true story: Desmond Doss (played by Andrew Garfield) was an American pacifist who served as an unarmed medic on the battlefields during World War II. The film tells of his struggle to serve as he wanted to and his very unusual status as a war hero.Doss's story as a conscientious objector is very unusual. In most cases, this situation was used to avoid military service entirely. In Doss' case, he truly wanted to serve but without holding or using a weapon. The uniqueness of this story goes further in the rare situation of a main character being ostracized due to faith (Doss was a Seventh-day Adventist) and principle. The story is further enhanced in its exploration of World War I veterans (here displayed by Desmond's father) who remain bitter from their war experiences and can't stand the idea of their sons going through the same hell.Garfield does a fine job in displaying the naïveté and innocence of a rural Virginia boy with ideals that seem hopeless at first but who truly knows better by the end. Other stand-out performances include those of Hugo Weaving as Desmond's troubled father and Vince Vaughan as an over-the-top drill sergeant who's rather funny with his insults.The battle scenes in Okinawa, Japan are very well orchestrated by director Mel Gibson. But sadly, these scenes are so long and frequent that their horror can end up numbing the audience who are well aware of the accuracy of such a tragic part of history - not only for that war but those that followed and those happening now.""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a fine war film with a very different twist on the meaning of heroism.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A fine piece of work, and a story that will no doubt be compared to the director's own personal plight.","Whatever your opinion is of Mel Gibson, the once-Hollywood A-lister turned exile following that infamous drunken rant at the police back in 2006, it's unlikely that any other living director could have told the tender and bloody story of World War II hero and Medal of Honor recipient Desmond Doss with quite the same mixture of visceral horror and religious bent. There have been a myriad of movies recounting the acts of heroism and barbarism that occurred during the conflict, but most fail to stand out or tell their tale in a way that is unique. Gibson has defied his (understandable) haters and crafted a fine piece of work, and a story that will no doubt be compared to the actor/director's own personal plight.Essentially a movie of two parts, both in terms of tone and quality, screenwriters Robert Schenkkan (HBO's The Pacific) and Andrew Knight (The Water Diviner) take the conventional biopic route by going way back to Doss's childhood living with his mother (Rachel Griffiths) and abusive, alcoholic father (Hugo Weaving) in Virginia. He is raised a Seventh-day Adventist and works in the local church, and as he eventually grows into Andrew Garfield, starts to romance the pretty girl who will later become his wife, Dorothy (Teresa Palmer). These early scenes have a corny gloss to them, like watching a big- budget Lifetime movie with a slightly better script. While the incredibly cute romance between the couple is beautifully played by the two main leads, the movie doesn't really get going until Doss follows his brother in volunteering to fight against the Japanese.Undeterred by his restrictive religious beliefs, which forbid him to even touch a gun, Doss hopes to do his part by working as a medic. He first must go through boot camp, where he quickly finds himself in hot water with his drill instructor Sgt. Howell (Vince Vaughn) and Captain Glover (Sam Worthington) when revealing himself to be a conscientious objector. Rejecting a ticket home by way of psychiatric discharge, Doss becomes an outcast in his unit and is bullied by his fellow recruits. A stint in army jail and a trial ensues before Doss is eventually allowed to rejoin his squad before they are shipped off to the Pacific. It is during the Battle of Okinawa, and more specifically the mission to secure Maeda Escarpment - nicknamed 'Hacksaw Ridge' - that Doss will prove his worth, while the unrelenting horror of war explodes around him.Anyone familiar with Gibson's previous work will know what to expect: No punches are pulled in the truly horrific battle scene, which lasts for pretty much the entire second half. Doss rushes somewhat elegantly through exploding heads and young men holding their own guts, as a seemingly endless wave of Japanese screamers lunge at them with rifles and swords. To call this the most disturbing depiction of war would be untrue (Elem Klimov's Come and See will forever hold that title), but it's damn near close. Though the splatter is relentless, it also manages to wear you down psychologically, so you can almost feel the weight of every bullet- ridden body Doss manages to drag to safety. Garfield is terrific, managing to charm with a near-permanent goofy grin that makes it seem like Doss knows and is comfortable with exactly what life expects of him. Somewhat surprisingly, so is Vaughn, who injects what I expected would be a clichéd boot camp montage with some laugh-out-loud humour. Bravo then, and welcome back Mel (haven't we forgiven actors for much worse?).",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mel Gibson Returns with A Masterpiece!,"Mel Gibson is BACK. Yes, the Oscar-Winning Legend makes a thumping return as a Director after a 10-year hiatus with 'Hacksaw Ridge'. Gibson looms large on celluloid & gives Andrew Garfield a chance to prove his mighty talent.'Hacksaw Ridge' captures the inspiring & heartbreaking World War II experiences of Desmond Doss, an American Pacificist combat medic who was a Seventh-day Adventist Christian, who refused to carry or use a firearm or weapons of any kind. Doss became the first conscientious objector to be awarded the Medal of Honor, for service above and beyond the call of duty.Desmond Doss was a man of conviction & relentless humanity. He chose to save lives, rather than taking any. Set in a time when humanity was at its lowest (War is never a thing of pride for any of us), Doss's journey comes across so strong & faith based, it totally blew my mind.'Hacksaw Ridge' is fabulously directed Gibson. He's in top-form & deserves complete credit for choosing to make a film upon a real-life hero. Gibson deserves an Oscar-Nomination & hopefully Hollywood will nominate him this year. Simon Duggan's Cinematography captures Doss's courageous journey & the brutality of war, expertly. John Gilbert's Editing is perfect. Art & Costume Design are good. War-Sequences are fantastically choreographed. Rupert Gregson-Williams' Score is brilliant.Performance-Wise: Andrew Garfield is up for vie top-honors.

"Rich in Message, Rich in Meaning, Rich in Mel Gibson's Style","Can you do something crazy? Can you endure the pain of being mocked and feel determined to go your way? No matter if you hesitate with the answer or not, here is a film you really should see.Mel Gibson with his great comeback after 10 years is far from 'attentive exhibitionism' and from the very start, he calls our attention to the hero of his story who managed to put a little bit of the world tearing itself apart back together."" Yes, unique story rich in meaning and message where the inner world of the director seems to correspond to the inner world of the protagonist, Desmond Doss, as Robin Collin pointed out a story of an outcast finding redemption through superhuman levels of suffering.""PROTAGONIST. Matt Zoller Seitz in his review on the film memorably observed that HACKSAW RIDGE is the movie which is actually 'at war with itself.' Following this track of argumentation, we can say that Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) embodies that contradiction. His inner convictions, his upbringing place him at war with the world around, arouse incredible dilemmas in him. The fight of the inside that he undertakes from the start is captivating. As a son of a desperate WWI veteran Tom (Hugo Weaving) who himself openly expresses bitterness of war and disappointment that arises from serving his country, Desmond fights with the haunting presence of his father's psyche within himself (though he cannot win completely) and develops his own convictions based on Faith and God's commandments, namely: Thou shalt not kill"" The picture of Cain killing Abel that hangs in his house (also mentioned in Frances Doss's book) imprints a powerful trace in his memory. Innocent, genuine, physically weak but spiritually strong, he goes to serve the country. How? Without any weapon but medical stuff to protect life. In short, you remain a great human being even if you are placed, either by coincidence or some destined fate, in the worst hell imaginable. But what a way to the top.Consider mainstay aspect of climbing.WRONG JUDGMENTS: A young man who initially evolves mockery rather than respect and rejection rather than acceptation personifies wrong judgments that people rush to indoctrinate and later find themselves in rather shameful finale. Mel Gibson, when taking about his film in one of the interviews, memorably stated that he himself wonders if he could have that much faith that would enable him to crawl into a battle, to enemy fire without the weapon just to save other people's lives."" What could drive this young man to handle that? Perhaps, one scene may sheds light on this aspect of courage that, as the film follows, absorbs us. After Smitty, his friend dies on Hacksaw Ridge and all meaning seems to have lost all meaning, Desmond asks God What is it you want of me?"" That scene most powerfully speaks to mind and soul: the profound and humble question of his existence is directed to God. Andrew Garfield does a splendid job as Desmond portraying his courage combined with seemingly retreating position, his openness to help combined with delusively reclusive solitude. Another powerful moments that Garfield handles with exceptional skill are the scenes when he justifies his convictions. The reactions around him are mesmerizing.We clearly see this clash between what the world could truly be and what the world actually is like depending on whether more and more people look deep down to their conscience. Seitz nicely mentions this saying that they can feel the truth of what Doss is saying. But they can't imagine the world being anything other than what it is, a place ruled by brute force and cruelty.""OTHER CAST: Mel Gibson's film can really boast wonderful cast that make the story vivid and place it within a nicely framed whole. The one that first comes to mind is Vince Vaughn, excellent in the role of Captain Howell. Mel Gibson states clearly in one interview that he inhabits the character"" and Robbie Collin labels his performance as his most roundly appealing"" in at least a decade. He is brute to those boys but not without reason; he trains them and prepares them to the worst horror they will experience. Yet, as others, he is too absorbed by wrong judgments. Luke Bracey is very memorable as Smitty, a character who develops a profound relationship with the protagonist though, at first, he feels the superiority of his own looks and skills.TERESA PALMER: As much as the second half of the movie emphasizes the Okinawa events and is, undeniably, a war movie, the majority of its first part is a love story. The beautiful Dorothy that Desmond meets by chance in hospital having saved a man's life after the automobile accident, is one of the most powerful and pure depictions of a woman in film. Gibson refer to her warmth. Their scenes (Dorothy and Desmond's) though naive at certain moments, are the most pleasant, innocent scenes between a man and a woman. She does a wonderful job in the film not resorting to sweetness yet simultaneously, not losing pure appeal. The scenes echo Gibson's style as well, particularly the moment they climb the rock and kiss Kudos to cinematographer Simon Duggan. The psychological aspect is striking here...Desmond does his best, at the same time struggling not to be like his father.'Mel Gibson managed to make a film about family, faith, love and forgiveness all put the test in an arena of violent conflict' (Peter Travers). HACKSAW RIDGE is another great gift for cinema of today. In times when war is raging in many places of the world and talks of peace seem to be mere words in vain, such a hero speaks to our Times. Don't give up to do something crazy for the world if you are with God and SAVE human life NOT KILL.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One More,"Despite all the controversies that Mel Gibson has around him as a person few will argue about his immense talent as a filmmaker. He has proved himself to be one of the most consistent directors working today and Hacksaw Ridge is some of the best work he's done in his entire careerThe core story of this film is simply fascinating, a man who went into one of the worst engagements of the Second World War without any kind of weapon to defend himself with and this story is one that the viewer can easily get behind because it is so well established why Doss feels the need to do this while not shining him in a truly heroic light. Plenty of time is devoted to his opponents and it's also made clear why they oppose his views as it is understandable why they wouldn't feel they could depend on him to defend them in battle and there is room for the audience to decide where they stand in this argument.One of this films greatest strengths is the fact that it's puts all its characters, as well as the actors who play them, first. Andrew Garfield, in my opinion, gives the best performance of his entire career in this film he just perfectly played Doss' constant inner struggle while always remaining optimistic. Vince Vaughn's role in this film had made me curious in the lead up to this film but it's easy to say that he exceeded all of my expectations, not only was he hilarious as a drill instructor but he gave some very good serious moments that made me like his character all the more and makes me want to see more of this kind of role from him. Teresa Palmer was also great in this movie she had excellent chemistry with Garfield and I absolutely bought her as a love interest. Hugo Weaving blew me away in this movie, I've never seen this kind of work from him, he was so believable as this torn up man who has had some much taken away from him by war.He first half of this film mainly focuses of Doss' romance with his future wife and his motivations for his pacifism and while it's defiantly a bit slow and cheesy at times it worked very well. I loved the romance between Garfield and Palmer it was such a sweet relationship an one I could easily get behind. When we eventually got to the training portion of this film it became all the more engaging, seeing Doss face opposition at every turn was extremely engaging, you got a clear sense to both sides of the argument and perfectly set up the horrors that were to come in the next act. This film switched from an engaging drama to a terrifying experience in an instant and it worked to perfection. Everything the war was built up to be came to ahead and made it clear just how hard it was gong to be for a Doss to keep up his pact but it was no less engaging and was even more so.Mel Gibson directed this film masterfully, he directions action like no other director working today. He doesn't show the battle of Okinawa in a glamorised way but as it was, as a hellish experience with very little hope of survival for the soldiers who thought in it. Even when bullets aren't flying he kept a consistent tension throughout this entire act that never let up.My only real issue with Hacksaw Ridge was some aspects of the way it concluded, it feels as if Doss has proved something to his fellow soldiers and feels as if more could be explored now that he has but instead the film concludes in a very abrupt way that left me feeling as if they're was still more waiting to be explored and experienced.Despite some aspects of its conclusion, Hacksaw Ridge worked on every other level. It was incredibly touching, harrowing and intense. While it was easy to get behind Doss as a character there were plenty moments where it felt as if they're was room to see the perspective of others in his views. When the war sequences begin they are depicted as they should be and in no way way that is glamorous or clean. I adored Hacksaw Ridge and I can't wait to see what Mel Gibson does next as a director.9.5/10-A (Phenomenal)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"You think ""Saving Private Ryan"" was gruesome and bloody .... This will blow your socks off.","""Help me get one more.""Even the worst horror can't make me look at the screen with disgust. But the moment one of these American soldiers set his hand on a seemingly lifeless body, a hysterical scream sounded and all hell broke loose, it did. The image of that unfortunate soldier whose body is torn to pieces by a devastating hail of bullets, took my breath away abruptly. And that's the start of a brutal and bloody narrative. Yet another unknown story, doomed to disappear in the annals of this terrible great world war. Again the story is infused with some goody-goody events. Plus it has a high ""outcast becomes ultimate hero"" level. But that's the only criticism I can think of. For the rest, this is an emotionally shattering film.The film immediately begins with a slow motion footage of the battlefield. A chaotic war scene. Infantrymen are shot to pieces. Japanese soldiers are running towards a certain dead. Disemboweled bodies. A pile of mangled corpses. And when there's a sign of life, they are mercilessly burned with a flamethrower. After a while you wonder if this isn't a bit exaggerated. But then again, for those who weren't there, it's difficult to imagine the hell these soldiers were in. And even while sitting safely in your lazy chair watching this horrifying spectacle, the realistic sound effects and gruesome images will make you sh*t your pants out of sheer anguish for sure. And this, my friends, was just a foretaste.""Hacksaw Ridge"" jumps back in time after this introduction. Back to the rustic rural life in Virginia where Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) grew up. His pacifism was sparked the day he nearly killed his brother after hitting him in the head with a heavy brick. But he wants to serve his country and voluntarily signs up for the army. His family felt as though they have been hit by a bomb (no pun intended). Especially his father Tom (Hugo Weaving) , an ex-soldier who survived the 1st world war. When it turns out that Desmond stubbornly continues to refuse to touch a weapon, his training becomes a series of harassment by fellow soldiers and the military command does everything to get rid of him. But a verdict is delivered by the court-martial, after an ultimate interference by his father, stating that he may serve his country without taking up arms. So armed with nothing but a pocket-sized bible Desmonds he's off to the front. Hell on the island of Okinawa.""Hacksaw Ridge"" is divided into two contrasting parts. On the one hand the cozy, peaceful first part where the sprightly Desmond tries to seduce his future wife and where he enrolls after which he starts his training. And on the other the bloody battle on the island of Okinawa. Actually it's almost the same format as used in ""Full metal jacket"". The stereotype of the average medic serving in a war, whose job is to take care of the wounded on the battlefield, is being refined here in no time. That image of the huddled, frightened soldier with a red cross on his helmet is replaced by a heroic, self-sacrificing soldier who would walk through fire for his fallen comrades. And this image is reinforced by the figure Desmond, a conscientious objector who's running around the battlefield like a Speedy Gonzales and rescues abandoned soldiers who were doomed to die there. Unfortunately, this message was just a little bit exaggerated in my opinion.It's not only the images of this war that'll leave an impression on you, but also the rather magnificent acting. Andrew Garfield plays in a convincing way the devout and sometimes seemingly naive Desmond. By smiling constantly in a retarded way, it looks as if he isn't right in his mind (No wonder he joined the army voluntarily). In addition, we see a few brilliant supporting roles such as the one from Vince ""Term Life"" Vaughn (again proof he can play something different than a goofy not-so-funny part) as drill sergeant Howell and Hugo Weaving as Desmond's father. But most impressive is the fact that this is all based on true facts and that Desmond Doss was the first conscientious objector who was awarded the ""Medal of Honor"" for ""conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action"".In my opinion this film primarily showcases stupidity of mankind. A portrait of the madness during this World War. The senseless waste of young lives while trying to conquer an insignificant rock (A bit like ""Hamburger Hill"". Only in reverse). I'm convinced that many of those heroic soldiers were asking themselves what the hell they were doing there at that time. I bet they didn't see the point anymore of this whole operation.

Best movie I've seen in theaters so far in 2016.,"This movie is based on the true story of Desmond Doss, a WW2 medic and conscientious objector who received the Medal of Honor for staying behind and retrieving 75 wounded soldiers from the battlefield.This is the most brutally realistic WW2 movie since Saving Private Ryan. There's limbs being blown off leaving ragged stumps, compound fractures, all that good stuff. One little touch that I really liked was when it showed long-deceased corpses there were maggots all over the skulls and rats eating the bodies. That's something I've never seen before in a war film so I'm glad they included those details.All the actors are surprisingly fantastic, from Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss to Vince Vaughn as the drill sergeant to Hugo Weaving as the father, there is not a single weak performance.There have been many attempts to replicate the effectiveness of Saving Private Ryan, Fury comes to mind. None of those movies have the same effect since we don't care about the characters as much, but thankfully this movie wisely takes the time to develop its characters. The first half of the film largely focuses on Doss' moral dilemma of being a CO and the reactions of those around him.Also, in Chris Stuckmann's review of this movie on Youtube, he mentions how there was one scene where the smoke clears and one of the characters says ""oh no, I lost my cover"" and one of the women in his theater covered her face and said ""oh no!"". I swear in my theater at that exact same moment, there was a woman who shouted ""oh my God!"" and covered her face. I guess you know you have a suspenseful scene when you get the exact same reaction out of the exact same scene.Any problems I have with the movie are largely nitpicks. Some scenes felt a little rushed and others felt a little too long. I'm not sure how accurate the film was to the real events, but there was one scene in a tunnel which was the only scene that felt Hollywoodized in any way. Also at the end of the movie they show stock footage, and I personally feel it would've been more effective if it were placed at the beginning for a number of reasons I can't get into without spoiling some stuff.These little things don't impact the core of the film too much though. This is an emotional, suspenseful, inspiring film, probably the best I saw in theaters this year, and I highly recommend you see it. Its not quite as good as Saving Private Ryan, but it comes pretty close. It might just be because I have a soft spot for WW2 movies, but I give Hacksaw Ridge a 9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Saving Private Ryan plus Full Metal Jacket = Hacksaw Ridge,"Seen Full Metal Jacket?

The mass of Australian actors that make up the rest of the cast generally mask their accents well enough.

The Masterpiece,"Only a few films in the world exist would make me watch them over and over again. In 1995, Mel Gibson directed Braveheart and this piece work has done so well that we continue to celebrate this movie today. Movies based on the true story have enormous power and theme with feelings and emotions subject matter touches real lives therefore, it is only right the director would want to show to the audience the real story to be close as possible to the reality. Director Mel Gibson has shown his excellent technique & unique work again in what I call a Masterpiece which is: The Hacksaw Ridge.I watched Hacksaw Ridge for the first time and I had no idea what the film is about, the only information I had that it was based on the actual events. I thought about another boring war movie where most of the scenes are taken on the battlefield. Surprisingly, after the first minutes of the film, I was interested in the music composition, amazing story adaptation, pictures, etc. The film made such an impression on me that I started to be curious who is responsible for directing and an excellent acting performance. He could not have handle a real story of the medic Desmond T. Doss any better as shown in this movie. With its realistic scenes and great acting by Andrew Garfield playing the main role, it engages the viewer into the reality, romance, war, drama, faith and strong willpower. I recommend to every viewer, this film carries a strong message for all of us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Gibson Delivers Again,"One thing I've noticed with skilled directors like Gibson and Eastwood is that they know how to carve out a story, making it complete. One of the basic things a story must have is a structured act one, two, and three, and a solid end, which any good director knows is incredibly important and an opportunity to put the finishing touches on their work. With that being said, it's amazing how many movies nowadays fail at basic structure.Gibson delivers again with an unforgettable story about a hero who fought in the battle of Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa Japan during World War II. Gibson's arsenal now includes powerhouse films like Braveheart, Apocalypto, The Passion of the Christ, and now Hacksaw Ridge.The movie begins effectively as a love story and backstory of Desmond Doss before transitioning into acts two (bootcamp) and act three (the battle of Hacksaw Ridge). The contrast between acts one and three is so stark, it feels like a completely different film for each. Love and war? This contrast was a little bothersome and the film does have some somewhat cheesy parts in the middle, so it's not perfect. But overall, it's an awesome movie and I really liked the ending.It's really different. While the war scenes are what you's expect, some aspects of the movie are rare for a Hollywood picture. For one, most of the main actors, except for Garfield and Vaughn, are unknowns and from what I've read many are Australian. The ending was very different too, and that for me definitely worked great. And it just mixes in all these elements of faith, religion, war, and love all together in a way you don't often see.While I enjoyed the whole film, I was leaning toward a respectable 7/10 through the first two-thirds, but after the way it ended and viewing it in its entirety, I really liked it and rate it an 8 out of 10.Awesome movie and a must see. Possibly one of the best war movies of the last 20 years, but it's more than just a war movie. It's also a love story and inspirational.This is the best movie of the year.8/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The making of a hero.,"Desmond Doss is a hero. In the middle of total carnage he is out there saving lives. This should serve as the basis for a great movie. This movie comes close to being just that, a great movie, but just misses the mark. It has lots of action and excellent acting set in a time and place that is still known and remembered with reverence today. But most of all, it is about a man who stays true to his principles, and against all odds triumphs. The battle of Okinawa is depicted in all its gory violence. Soldiers on both sides are dying by the hundreds. Through it all, Desmond Doss does his duty, which, as a medic, is to save lives. Nothing stops him, not even a grenade. And if that isn't enough, he's married to a beautiful young lady who adores him and whose photograph he carries in his Bible, which she gave him as a present and which he takes into battle. To tell this story, the director Mel Gibson, pulls out the stops. It is Hollywood through and through. From the confrontation scene in the barracks, to the presence of the overbearing sergeant, to the inclusion of the devoted girlfriend, the hero perseveres and finally proves himself on the battlefield, proving all his detractors wrong. If someone wants to watch a movie about a hero, this is the movie to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Perfection,"'Hacksaw Ridge' is the kind of film you don't even have to think about what you're going to rate it, it's simply a '10', no questions asked. This is unquestionably the best film I have seen so far in 2016 and incidentally the only '10' I have given out this year. I went in expecting it to be good, I had heard good things, and it still managed to top my expectations and blow me away. That's a sure sign of quality. Films you expect to be good going in have a lot tougher time impressing you than films you have no high hopes for obviously, so 'Hacksaw Ridge' must be a hell of a film. Another sign of quality is when the run time flies by. At 139 minutes, this is a long film by modern standards. However, the time just evaporates and when the credits roll you can't believe it's already over.So what makes it so good? Let's start with Mel Gibson's direction, it's impeccable. The pacing, the story, the characters, the action, it's all handled absolutely masterfully and just blends together perfectly to make such a nice viewing experience. The tone of the film is very heavy at times, particularly in the second half. The action is absolutely chaotic and yet somehow Gibson manages to make it all extremely easy to follow and keep track of everything that is going on. He also holds nothing back. It's almost unbearably gruesome at times and yet it's so good it's almost like he's sitting in the seat behind you, forcing your head still and making you watch.Andrew Garfield in the lead role was mind-blowing. He made me genuinely care for the character and sold me in every scene. The other person who blew me away was Vince Vaughn. I wasn't sure going in exactly what I was going to get from him. After his first scene though I finally understood his casting, and it was perfect. In a very similar role to R. Lee Ermey's in 'Full Metal jacket' Vaughn makes us laugh, but never at the expense of his character. We still respect him with our utmost sincerity, and you can tell the characters do as well. Again, we also care immensely for the outcome of his character. In that respect he was probably better than Ermey, but Ermey still topped him in terms of the verbal onslaught he unleashes on the soldiers.There's literally no aspect of the film I can think to criticise. It's as close to perfection as films generally come. I would advise you to come along prepared for a very moving film, both emotionally and visually. There are some very heavy moments, but if you're game, they all add to the incredibly high quality of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A good – not great – picture on perhaps one of the greatest WW II stories ever put on film,"Mel Gibson goes back to directing one decade after he delivered Apocalypto, a stunning adventure film blending history, romance and tremendous amounts of savagery. Interestingly, these three narrative pillars have been at the very core of Braveheart (1995), The Passion of the Christ (2004), Apocalypto (2006) and, ten years later, are now deeply rooted into Hacksaw Ridge, a war film depicting the bravery of Army Medic Desmond Doss, who enrolled to serve during World War II.Besides telling the story of an undoubtedly true American hero, Hacksaw Ridge dedicates a substantial amount of screen time to the backstory and development of its characters, sometimes successfully, sometimes not as much. The film is pretty much divided into two distinct halves, the latter of which is the Battle of Okinawa.The aesthetic qualities of Hacksaw Ridge cannot be denied. Visually, it looks neat. Forget the over saturated cinematography of late Middle- East set war films, or the under saturated greyish tones of Saving Private Ryan (which all look great, but Hacksaw Ridge looks different). Instead, Hacksaw Ridge feels naturally lit, and the horrors depicted and the smothering atmosphere are nourished by torn limbs, blood, guts, burning men and screams. The battle sequences are intense and overall well directed. Mel Gibson's direction is competent, especially in the first half. While the battle sequences do feature never-before-seen grisliness and some surprisingly innovative shots at times, Gibson's sense of geography is a bit chaotic, and probably purposely so. After all, we are not following the squad capture an objective, but rather a medic going in all directions to rescue his wounded fellow soldiers. Bravery is well depicted, and Doss saying ""Lord, help me get one more"" will echo through your mind when the credits start rolling.Back to the first half of the film, where the romance, family backstory and training camp occur, I thought it was good. There is a lighter tone to all of these parts than what can be found in comparable films. I don't think that's neither a good nor a bad thing: what it is, though, is a bit of an unusual vehicle for emotion in such a film. Forget the big violins. There is a somewhat « feel good » aspect to it all, almost comedic, even when it comes to the training camp segment. At first I thought it was Vince Vaughn playing the Sargent, but it's actually the dialogue which carries more humour than most would probably expect, blended with the expeditious nature of the narrative structure, where very little time is actually dedicated to characters' emotions and is instead driven by a relatively quick succession of meaningful actions. The approach itself appears to become a trend among recent war films (American Sniper definitely comes to mind). It kept me thinking about Steven Spielberg, who once said that he likes to show his characters think in his films. I found that remark to be interesting, and when I watched Saving Private Ryan after that, it made me realize how many of these moments the film features (and other Spielberg films as well), and how, emotionally, sharing an intimate moment with the protagonist before jumping to the next scene allows for great viewer involvement, especially after an intense battle sequence where plenty of supporting characters die. To me, this expeditious way of depicting events prevented Hacksaw Ridge from rising to greatness along the likes of war films such as Full Metal Jacket, The Thin Red Line or Saving Private Ryan. The abusive and troubled father backstory, among other things, suffered greatly from the approach. I also felt like the heroic actions depicted in Hacksaw Ridge did not carry as much weight meaning-wise because of that, although the story that is told is probably greater than any other World War II story ever put on film. There are some emotional moments in the film, but very little time for the viewer (and the characters!) to let them properly sink in before moving on to the next scene.The cast was excellent. Andrew Garfield portrays a gentle, almost naïve young man whose principles and faith are absolutely unbreakable. The supporting cast is also fantastic. There is a bit of an unusual light-hearted aspect to many of the characters, but this could have came as a breath of fresh air, had that not been awkwardly exploited due to the narrative structure.The ending features what I found to be a very pleasing and emotion- filled surprise. Definitely one of the film's highlights for me.Overall a worthy war picture, telling an amazing story that feels like it could have been delivered a differently to really rise to its full potential.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Authentic WWII experience with a different perception of WAR,"Well this is one of the movies which does not fail to give you goosebumps and you will sure leave the theater with a heavy heart. There are many WWII movies but this one sure is worth a watch and tops my list alongside with Saving Private Ryan & Full Metal Jacket. The movie is based on real life War Combat Medic's hero the late CPL.Desmond Thomas Doss. Basically to summarize what is stunning about this movie I want to break it down in to three parts (Narration/Screenplay/Direction, Cinematography, Action and Acting)Direction / Screenplay: Mel Gibson has surly done his homework and it is evident that he is put his heart and soul into retaining the real essence of a real lift story, the movie starts of slow like a mellow drama and slowly builds its pace, the WAR scenes were so real and totally immersive (Not like Michael Bay style ;). I have a strong feeling this movie is going win many awards including the Academy. There are very few movies you see a unanimous applaud from the audience when the credits roll and this is sure was one of them. Where was Mel Gibson all these years? he has sure set a new standard and made a swashbuckling comeback so to say. This title is one you got to own the DVD/Bluray when it is out and watch it in the theaters.Cinematography: The movie never failed to give the feel of the WWII era, the Dress, Army Uniform, Body language, lighting, dialog, vehicles, Weapons all were carefully crafted to give you the authentic WWII experience. From use of slow pan shots to switching between steady and POV cameras even from the mellow dramatic scenes to the action paced blood splashing scenes you will never be bored. The boot camp scenes and WAR scenes had a close resemblance to Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan but the overall story gives you a different perception of WAR altogether. There are many enjoyable moments in the movies from slow motion of shells popping out from M3 sub machine gun, carnage of Japs with M2 flamethrower, non-submission of PoW etc.. The night scenes were shots with some exceptional camera blocking techniques can't explain much just watch the movie you will understand.Acting: Well this movie is going to be a milestone in Andrew Garfield's career. Mel Gibson has made use of Andrew's full potential. He has re-lived CPL.Doss in the movie and I hope he gets an Oscar. Also stunning performance by Teresa Palmer (Strangely I felt she resembled - Christine Stewart first cousin look alike if there was one ;) don't know why) & brief and subtle performance by Hugo Weaving.Overall just go and watch this one don't miss you will not be disappointed for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Very good movie,"I like war movies. But this one is very good. I didn't know about Desmond Doss, maybe because I'm not from US, but i'm sorry for that. It's a hero and Andrew Garfield made a good job in this role. I would say that he could win the Oscar for the performance, but it's a long shot. Mel Gibson made a great job with the directing of this film and together with a great team delivers an outstanding film that will impress a lot of people (i hope).Great movie, great actors, great staff!

hacksaw ridge review,"Great movie all around ,lots of action , but also up close personal stuff and well produced and directed . great there was a guy who never shot anyone become a hero,because of hes convictions,and hes religion. God was what directed and helped him thru it all. remember never could have won any battle or any war unless people were killed ,by our soldiers . so if there were thousands not wanting to fight because of their religion ,we would be in a mess. One was OK and worked out greatly , but we still needed the courage and the killing of our enemies by our men,which includes many soldiers losing their lives . taking the ground ,winning the battle .No war is really ever won unless the ground is taken and the enemy destroyed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Mel Gibson Returns With One Of The Most Vicious, Violent & Unrelenting Exhibitions Of War On Film Canvas","A second coming of sorts for the controversial filmmaker whose recent past had been an endless series of scandals, Hacksaw Ridge marks Mel Gibson's long-awaited return to the director's chair and he lets his presence felt & relevance known to everyone almost immediately, for his latest is a biographical war drama that depicts the horror of warfare in all its glory yet captures it in a manner that highlights the film's anti-war themes with clarity.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Remarkable Story,"Putting aside his personal life, Mel Gibson is a great director & has a knack for big scope pictures based on true stories. Now is Hacksaw Ridge the next great thing from the infamous director? Maybe, maybe not.As I say about a lot of genres these days, we don't get a lot of great war films. We just don't. Free State of Jones, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, and even 13 Hours haven't been great. But I was hoping Hacksaw Ridge would reinvigorate the genre, and perhaps reinvent it. To a certain extent, it does. A story about a Seventh-day Adventist who wants to join the army as a conscientious objector makes for a different way of telling a World War II story.I think the problem here is that the first and second halves of this story feel like two completely different films altogether. The first mainly deals with Desmond Doss' (Andrew Garfield) budding romance with Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) back at his hometown of Lynchburg, Virgina. I really bought into the cuteness and sincerity of that relationship, but it gets lost entirely in the second half. I think I would have preferred more of a balance between a straight romance story and a straight war film. And not a split down the halfway mark of the film, I mean each aspect sprinkling into each other.I can't deny how impressive Gibson's ability to direct intense battle sequences is, however. Braveheart has one of the most beautifully shot finales of all time, and there's plenty of that to go around in the battle sequences here. The fact that Doss' beliefs prevented him from being able to pick up any sort of weapon and he managed to save over 70 men during the Battle of Okinawa. The story is remarkable and watching Doss relentlessly saving one person after another when everyone else had left, is definitely inspiring. But I think the rush of it all overwhelmed my enjoyment of the battle, considering the first half is a different film entirely.Vince Vaughn, Hugo Weaving, and Rachel Griffiths round out the cast nicely and add other levels of emotion to an already fascinating story. But if I had to change something, it would be the pacing and direction from Gibson. If Gibson could have found a way to sprinkle in romantic scenes to the unsettling battle or the other way around, the film would have been more fluid and even. Other than that, this is definitely a film worth seeing in theaters just for the remarkable performance of Garfield alone.+Cute romance+Comradery at the Army base+Performances all around-Uneven direction, pacing7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The rest of the cast is perfect in their roles.The war scenes of the Battle of Okinawa are brutal yes like the great Saving Private Ryan but that's war. The theme of pacifism v war is superbly played out. The Japanese came across as suicidal maniacs yet brave soldiers.I was never bored for one minute.

"Great Story, Long Lost Values","Great war story with a very real depiction of war and loss of life with brother's in arms. There are some scenes that are far reaching and quite brutal; this coming from someone that has been desensitized to almost everything. What I enjoyed most about Hacksaw Ridge is that in a time where our freedom was at the highest risk of loss; regardless of beliefs, race, color or creed, Americans had to come together to fight for what makes our country great, or at least laid the framework to greatness. Trying not to pull at any political strings in respect to democratic views from all sides...I digress.Overall, an incredible story of standing for one's personal beliefs, leaning on a higher power and serving their country while challenging what and how it means to serve. Great CGI, acting, videography and if you have a strong stomach, I highly recommend this movie. Powerful, moving, and inspiring.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Andrew Garfield secures himself as a leading man,"I was not in a hurry to rush into theaters to see Hacksaw Ridge, but in general I am not one of the first people running out to see war movies. I see Saving Private Ryan as the definitive World War II film. The battles in this movie were comparably shot, maybe more cinematic as opposed to live action, but the comparisons stop there. What shines through the most in this film heart, the triumphant glory we normally see reserved for sports films. While Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington pleasantly surprised me, Garfield's performance really carried the picture. The story builds without dragging, despite the fact that we don't even get to Okinawa until more than halfway through.

Saving Private Ryan mixed with Chariots of Fire,Mel Gibson did a wonderful job on this movie. I'm so glad to see him directing again. Hacksaw Ridge is a mix between Saving Private Ryan and chariots of Fire. Based on a true story the war footage is unbelievably realistic. The intensity of the battles fought and courage it took to fight them had me squirming in my seat. The faith of the hero in the story is nothing short of astounding. The romance facet of an innocent time long long was also very well done. It is the perfect Holiday movie. It is very inspiring and would be broadly appealing. I rarely see a movie twice in a theater but this is one I would in a New York minute.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
mixed reception,"So i just watched this movie last night. After 'We were soldiers' which was very historically accurate except for the glorious charge ending. I got the impression that this was going to be another historically accurate movie. Nothing can be further from the truth. I watched this movie with a buddy of mine and we both had the feeling of 'ooh right that guy is gonna die', 'what the hell is this call of duty?'. The only 2 parts that are accurate to a certain degree is the trail, but he was not saved by a letter from his father and the suppressing fire when attacking the pillbox. I am really struggling to understand why this movie has such positive reviews.This movie was 10 years in the making and it feels pretty bland. Americans shooting down entire Jap squads FROM THE HIP. Spider nerd kicking back grenades. There is even a scene where Vince Vaungh is being pulled on a blanket shooting back at enemies (call of duty anybody). I think the only reason this movie is getting positive scores is because it portrays certain American values to the limit. So thing that never happened: - Okinawa was not their first battle: guys are seen throwing grenades like a 2 year veteran; this would have worked if they showed their previous missions in Gaum and Leyte. - Doss by this point was already accepted by the soldiers: movies shows this as a grinding process of being accepted. - He was not saved by a magical letter from his father - This movie does show in a special way what shrapnel does to people - Movie does not show what Doss did the following days ( read about in on Wikipedia) just shows him saving a lot of people in one time(apparently this was done by Gibson as not to confuse people?) - Soldiers except for the ones that he did really save feel like disposable men All in all i only found 2 parts of the movie as previously mentioned that are partly accurate ( he does pray to help me get one more) Apparently this movie got a 10 min standing ovation at the end. At the end of the movie me and my buddy were already looking trough the internet trying to find if this movie was by any means accurate. That being said. I have mayor respect for all personnel that served and continue to do so. thank you for your service. This movie just left me with a pretty mixed feeling. I think if you're not a American you will look at this movie with different eyes than the America F*** yeah feeling this movie gives you.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Creative Mel Gibson Returns,"Desmond Doss with serious faithful sincerity and a ludicrous Southern accent, was the first conscientious objector in his words. It's a movie about a pacifist in wartime that wants to celebrate the subject's moral code while also reveling in the blood and guts of battle. It's a story of faith and humanity told by a man with, let's call them extremely suspect views. It's a movie that seeks to honor an honorable man, but does so at the expense of other honorable men. His father, a traumatized World War I veteran and violent alcoholic, beats Doss and his brother and mother, and Doss fears the same violence within himself. So he swears off guns and violence and clings tightly to his Bible. It's the first movie Gibson has directed since ""Apocalypto"" 10 years ago and i expect he will get Oscar for his directing.the only deficient thing But one surprise, given the drama of pacifism-versus-war that the movie has set up, is that there's never a single scene in which Desmond has to consider violating his principles and picking up a weapon in order to save himself or somebody else. A scene like that would have brought the two sides of ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" the violent and the pacifist — and, implicitly, the two sides of Mel Gibson — crashing together. But that would have been a different movie. One that, in the end, was a little less safe.Good movie and Bravo Great Mel Gibson.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Superb !!,I watched this movie not really knowing what to expect and I did not even know Mel Gibson directed it (Loved Braveheart) but what a superb moving thought provoking movie.

Phenomenal Movie With Brilliant Performances and Incredible Directing,"This is a phenomenal movie. Say what you will about Mel Gibson as a person, but he is a magnificent director. He navigates this complex and difficult story with ease, knowing the perfect ratio of character-driven moments to war-filled madness. The different aesthetic choices he made, in terms of the tone of the film and his approach to the different aspects of the movie, continue to prove his ability as a director. I'll get more into the war scenes later, but the way he chooses to showcase these sequences is masterful. Sure, we get tons of gory and bloody violence, but never does it feel glorified or for entertainment. It is purely to show the horrors of war and the madness that ensues on the battlefield, and Gibson walked that line perfectly. He also does fantastic things with the character of Desmond Doss, and how he uses other people's reactions to him to tell Desmond's story for him. Gibson easily could have had Desmond give us long, exposition-filled speeches about why he chooses not to kill, and we do get a couple of those, but only when they are absolutely necessary. Instead, Gibson utilizes supporting characters and the environment to paint the picture of why Desmond won't kill. It's a perfect example of show not tell, and I think it ultimately shows Gibson's mastery as a director...",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Sticking to his guns by refusing to carry them...,"Patton said that no ""bastard"" ever won a war by dying for his country but by making the other poor, dumb bastard die. Well, that wraps it quite well, war is all about death, but to admit it is also to ignore that figures like Desmond Doss existed, and bringing his extraordinary story to the big screen is enough a reason to praise Mel Gibson.And who would have thought that the 2017 line-up of Oscar-nominated directors would feature him? Oscar pundits expected many first-time nominees such as Chazelle, Jenkins, or Villeneneuve but if there ever was a spot to be occupied by a veteran, it belonged to either Scorsese or Eastwood. I'm glad Hollywood is a more forgiving place than we believed and that the members can see talent when it hit them in the face, to the point of rehabilitating ""Mad Mel"".Because, there is no doubt that when you finish ""Hacksaw Ridge"", you know there's no director who depicts heart-pounding battle sequences and heart-breaking characters like he does. This is the stuff the Academy can't ignore because it has a superb (true) story, it is well acted and directed and has this 'heart' element that can wow any audience. Comparisons with ""Saving Private Ryan"" are inevitable, but I hold this film in higher consideration because Gibson already proved his talent when it came to handle battle sequences and violence in ""Braveheart"", three years before Spielberg.But there is a more profound reason to admire ""Hacksaw Ridge"", while it portrays soldiers as heroes, it doesn't demonize the Japanese soldiers either, and we don't cheer at their demise. The movie is a humanistic masterpiece that transcends skin considerations, the fact that Doss also saves Japanese soldiers and that some can be seen committing acts of Bushido, prove that this is not a film about 'winning a war', but about not letting war defeat our humanity. Unfortunately, this aspect was overlooked, as marked by the seal of Gibson's infamy. Well, not only this is one hell of a film, but it is even better because you can tell it's from Gibson.Desmond Doss was the conscience objector who saved more than seventy lives in one of Okinawa's bloodiest slaughters without ever carrying a rifle, which makes him a purely Gibsonian, so to speak, character, as a vulnerable man caught in existential conflicts but moving forward nonetheless, finding strength in a totally unshakable Christian faith. Maybe that's the sensitive nerve the movie hits, especially from a director whose Christianity was spoiled by a fallacious association with anti-Semitism. But the film isn't about Christian faith, but plain faith, and one driven by positive values. After all, even a non-religious person can admit that ""Thou Shall Not Kill"" is universally humanistic.Desmond Doss belongs to that category of inspirational characters like Sir Thomas More or Frank Serpico; men who (maybe naively) believed in simple principles but never sold their soul out for the whole world, not even the call of duty. Doss refuses to carry a rifle, but not to go to the battle, as a medic, he won't kill people but save them. Andrew Garfield plays a character whose sweetness, sensibility and optimism contrast with the world he lives in, and he sort of gives you back a faith in humanity, severely undermined by this depressing year, and it tells you something about Gibson, he might seem to insist on violence, but it is always to emphasize the courage of the peaceful side.Like War, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" reveals both the worst and the best of humanity. This is no nihilistic, apocalyptic movie, the horror in the war scenes is brutal and gory as you might expect and they certainly earned Gibson his directing nod, but overall, the film is about this humble, modest, slender, thin man who wasn't focused on the killing, but on the healing role he could play in the midst of this barbarity. Soldiers' goal is 'death to the enemy' but when they leave the battleground and there's no one to kill anymore, saving lives become the only possible option.And this is the revelation, when Doss meets his destiny and transcends his condition, praying God, for nothing more than 'saving one more life', a powerful moment that echoes the 'I could have saved more' in ""Schindler's List"". It is quite an extraordinary achievement when the war scenes not only provide the most spectacular moments of the film, but also add to the depth of the characters, and the perception of Doss makes a 180° turn, as he goes from a coward to a living saint. The climax of the film is such a moving and emotional sequence that it redeems all the little flaws.I wasn't that impressed by the beginning which was pretty sentimental, but I remember I had similar feelings with the first act of Oliver Stone's ""Born on the Fourth of July"". Still, the back story provided some interesting hints on Doss' pacifist nature, including the personality of Hugo Weaving as his father, a bitter and alcoholic Great War veteran who sealed Doss' defiance toward guns and Teresa Palmer, his understanding fiancée. And when the boot camp sequence kicks off, the film is enriched by the performances of Vince Vaughn as the sergeant, Luke Bracey and Sam Worthington, and then, the final act justifies why the film needed this seemingly conventional start.Indeed, since when is conventionality a flaw when it comes to portray unconventional characters? Doss is perhaps one of the best revelations of 2016, if everyone respects the WW2 veterans for their courage, they'll admire Doss who made world a better place at a worst possible time. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is the testament to a man's extraordinary moral integrity and the miracle he accomplished ... and a director's unique talent, finally rehabilitated. Maybe an even more impressive miracle.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Folksy mediocrity punctuated with exceptional battle scenes,"'Hacksaw Ridge' is a deeply split movie. On the one hand there are some of the most horrifying, frankly excellent depictions of battleground carnage ever put on film. Sadly on the other, much more heavily weighted hand, there is a deeply mediocre, folksy boy goes to war movie surrounding them.Okay, so the bad points: Mel Gibson seems to have had the attitude when making this movie that maybe his audience hasn't seen any other war films and will happily sit through every scene from every war movie ever without yawning. So we get the scenes which show our young hero finding love before going off to war (check), a fierce but sensitive sergeant (check), the training scenes (check), yada yada yada. I can only think of one moment in the whole set-up, which lasts for a good hour twenty, where Gibson used a little subtlety to transition over a beat in the movie. Our hero, Private Doss, admires his wedding ring momentarily before talking to his new wife. This little moment spares us the need of a wedding scene and moves us closer to the pay-off, the film that Gibson actually wants to show us and that we actually want to see. The movie desperately needed more moments like this. Sure, the scenes are all made competently, but there's an insufferable lack of originality for such a long set-up.Exacerbating this mediocrity is the corny dialogue. Actually, corny isn't a strong enough word to describe just how 'gee shucks, mister' folksy, porch rocking chair hayseed the characters in this movie are. Now I'm not mocking 1940s Virginia, mostly because I just don't buy that this is what it was like. The dialogue is just plain bad and reveals a key reason why 'Apocalypto' is Gibson's best film.The cast are fine, with only one or two stand-out performances, notably from Hugo Weaving as the alcoholic father (check!) and Luke Bracey as the training ground foe turned battlefield friend (check!).Okay, so we finally get to Okinawa and the movie begins. The build-up to the battle is over-the-top but effective and by the time the first bullet is fired, the tension is unbearable. The battle itself is a film-making masterclass of war action. The first engagement with the Japanese in particular brilliantly balances the desire to convey the frenetic pace and chaos of the battle with the need for it to be coherent for the audience. The battle is fast and terrifying, but the editing allows us to take it in and follow the narrative of the action. This is no easy achievement and makes editor John Gilbert perhaps the only Oscar nominee from 'Hacksaw Ridge' to deserve the prize.It's in these scenes that we become re-acquainted with the man who made 'Apocalypto', that ceaselessly energetic, kinetic movie. When his characters move, rather than talk, Gibson is capable of genuinely entrancing sequences of film, in the same league as the likes of Sam Peckinpah or George Miller.It's a real shame that most of this movie is not these battle scenes, which are in stark contrast to the majority of the run time. It would be great if Mel Gibson could deliver us another tightly managed action epic like 'Apocalypto'. The best parts of this film, which are enough to lift the whole out of mere mediocrity, show that it was not a fluke.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mel Gibson is Back & Andrew Garfield Rises,"One of the best Dramatic Emotional movie this year (2016) if not the best. Mel Gibson comes back with a hell of a story and presented it to us in the best possible way with small budged compared with the great scenes he did and that is a great credit for him which proves that he is a great director.I love to talk at first about Hugo Weaving which was tremendous and Vince Vaughn was great . Andrew Garfield did his best role so far in his career with a really great potentials. We also shouldn't forget Sam Worthington who was also unexpectedly good.By watching this movie you are watching a master piece that was about to reach ""Saving Private Ryan"" and did a truly respectable try.And ""Please god, help me get one more"" My rating is 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A purple heart recipient with a heart of gold,"In his first work since Apocalypto Mel Gibson takes an unpopular story matched with an unpopular hero to show that you cannot win a battle until you have won the one inside of you. Growing off of his themes of the beauty that can occur in chaos he provides his most vivid, real, yet most out of this world story to date. Stemming off of past films Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ, Hacksaw Ridge provides a glimpse of how morals can thrive in a world with immorality.Andrew Garfield stars as Desmond Doss, a seemingly normal young man from Lynchburg Virginia who is born into unlikely circumstances. His father, a World War I veteran, is troubled by not only PTSD and alcoholism, but also his actions that come from them. Growing up Desmond sees the effects of violence and it not only shapes his life, but shapes many lives to come. World War II, the Japanese strike Pearl Harbor killing 2,403 brothers, friends, and loved ones. The country begins scrapping for anyone they can get in this desperate time. Despite their father's beliefs, Desmond, and his younger brother Harold, decide they cannot stay complacent, but have to enlist and ""fight"" for what they believe in.Quicker than the attack on Pearl Harbor, Desmond's enlistment takes a turn for the worse. He refuses to carry a weapon referencing the commandment ""Thou shall not kill"" as his cornerstone. A soldier without a gun? In a kill or be killed savage environment, Desmond does not back down. At boot camp, he is beaten before he even joins the battle. Harassed, ridiculed, and dehumanized by his fellow soldiers, his future and his worth on the battlefield looks grim. Striving to be a doctor, the path he has now chosen is not in his comfort zone and is looked down upon by his father, who does not want his sons to witness the hell he went through. Although Desmond does not have the means to pay for medical school, he decides to risk paying the ultimate price and puts his life on the line to save the people who want him gone just as much as the enemy.From explosive cinematics that gave it a three dimensional feel, to extensive character development that made me feel emotions that I have not felt in years, this movie grabbed my attention from round one. I am going to pull the trigger and say this movie was nothing short of exceptional. The moment the battalion charged the ridge, I felt my body go numb. From hair standing up to minutes without blinking the engrossing tale engulfed me emotionally and physically. The shots were so intimate and personal that I felt I was standing in that group myself. The producing was so masterful that the climax seemed never ending and the underlying themes served as a constant reminder of the loss that happened on more than just the battlefield. When the music cut out, the sound died, and good men took the final fall. That is when I was spoken to, when nothing was said at all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Well acted,"I pretty much found this film to be exactly what I expected. Very Hollywoodized, definitely concentrating on the emotional and sentimental aspects of the story with full force. But it's a good film. There's a certain backlash that has formed against the film for being so successful for the award precursors that leads to eventual Oscar nominations. I don't think it's one of the best films of the year, but that is unfortunate if it will keep some people from watching it. I do think Andrew Garfield's performance is worthy of praise. He really makes the total character work and he is really giving the role his all. Overall I do recommend it.

Tries Too Hard,"Well it just had to happen . A couple of days after reviewing FENCES a film that just screams ""Oh look at me please get that armful of Oscars ready"" . I self righteously claimed that I leave my politics and religion at the door of the cinema when I watch a movie . You can guarantee very soon a film will come along making a reviewer eat their words . HACKSAW RIDGE is that movie and from the outset it went out of its way to contradict anything I might have written recentlyI find it impossible to separate Mel Gibson the film maker from Mel Gibson the human being . If nothing else movies directed by Gibson have their own unique voice but it's what the voice is saying that rattles my cage . From the outset Gibson nails his world view to the mast and this cinematic ship sinks under the weight of the message . You have a film opening with graphic images of war along with a voice-over about the strength of God . Do I have to point out here's an ugly irony watching this in the post 9/11 world ? But hey Gibson doesn't do ironyThere is an interesting true life story at the centre of the film featuring Desmond T Doss , a pacifist who joined the US army despite being opposed to violence . Now unlike Doss I have never served on a frontline - but then neither has Gibson - so I'm not going to criticise someone who risked their life every moment of everyday in a war zone . He's a decorated hero . End of discussion . The problem is the story should have been told much better . The obstacles faced by Doss religious belief is constantly over done amongst the constant clichés . Stuff like this totally undermines the character study of a man doing things he doesn't agree with but nevertheless contributed to the greater good . Instead while watching HACKSAW RIDGE I was continually reminded that I was watching a predictable , old fashioned Oscar bait of a film which over eggs the pudding",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"A Great War Movie That Weaves Fact, Faith, & Fiction","It's been a while since a good old fashion war movie came out but if it was all building up to Hacksaw then it was totally worth it. Let's be honest: almost every ""based on a true story"" film has some made up parts. If it were completely true then the movie would be pretty boring. But for Hacksaw Ridge, most of it did actually happen and I am a bit shocked it wasn't made into a film earlier. Desmond Dos is a naive southerner who decides to join World War 2 despite the fact that he despises violence. He simply wants to help a unit as a medic but he finds opposition along the way as many believe he is simply a coward. By the end of the film though, he proves himself worthy of the title ""hero"". Andrew Garfield does a wonderful job of playing Desmond as he brings a simple charm to the character. He is very likable and I experienced some of the same emotions he was going through in the film. When he was frustrated, I was frustrated. When he was happy, I was happy for him. It felt like I was actually watching this man's life and not just a movie based on it. The other actors do a great job as well especially Vincent Vaughn who manages to be both funny and dramatic at the same time. The one thing about this film that might hurt it is the violence. The first third of the film is shot very beautifully and looks like an ideal vision of that time period. But the last third is all on top of Hacksaw Ridge which is piled with dead bodies, intestines, rats, blood, decapitated heads, you name it they got it. It works in a story sense because they never portray war as a pretty or fun thing but the film is also filled with Christian themes. Box office wise those Christian messages might have helped the film but because of it's R rating I doubt any youth groups are going to be piling into vans to see it. Which is a shame since the film is honestly a great representation of holding onto your beliefs no matter how others maybe feel about them. Over all, Hacksaw Ridge is a great film with a well structured story, likable characters, beautiful direction and tons of events to keep you entertained.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliant portrayal of a courageous story,"First of all Mel Gibson welcome back, a simply brilliant piece of cinematography, from minute one until the very end it was completely captivating, portraying what is in truth a very courageous and inspiring true story. Andrew Garfield produces what in my opinion his greatest performance to date his performance as Desmond Doss was nothing short of brilliant his performance and Gibson's performance in directing this masterpiece gave the film not only the credit the truly inspirational story deserved but gave me and everyone a great movie to enjoy. The way the film builds as it goes along keeps you glued to the screen not only drawing you in with the action but the emotion of the film was something to behold and how a act of true courage can inspire a entire country.

Formulaic and predictable war movie,"**Watched for the 2017 OscarsThis felt very formulaic and predictable. Every single war movie cliché is in this. It seemed to try and be too much like Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, or Platoon at many different points. It really didn't seem to be anything new, other than the insanely long action sequences that looked great, but also felt like a bit of a sensory overload.Additionally, the dialogue was incredibly and unbelievably cheesy, mostly between Desmond and Dorothy. I just couldn't buy it. At first I couldn't take Vince Vaughn seriously simply because he's Vince Vaughn, but he grew on me as the film progressed. Either way the acting was all just OK, nothing notable. The main character I found to be really whiny and unlikable for the most part. Everything he said made me cringe.Lastly, there were a few dream sequences the main character had that felt random and unfitting. They are never revisited or explained and are obvious that their dreams as their happening which makes me question the purpose of them.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Epic. Beautiful. Horrific. Moving. Masterful.,"I watched this movie with literally no idea what it was about, who was in it, or who directed it. I just read the first few lines of a couple of Netflix reviews, not enough for spoilers, but enough to get the impression that this might be a pretty special movie.It was.I was captivated from beginning to end. I don't think I even blinked. This is truly an extraordinary piece of filmmaking, with every aspect of its technical production a work of art, and every performance solid, nuanced, and truthful.Some way into the bucolic, beautifully evocative first half, I began to notice that several of the actors were Australian, and wondered briefly if it might be an Aussie director at the helm. But then I was swept away again, and didn't think about anything else until midway through the second half, during one of the many prolonged (and exquisitely realised) battle scenes, when the thought popped in to my head that this was perhaps the best sound design I'd ever heard in a movie. And then I was swept away again.I had no idea that it was directed by Mel Gibson until the end credits. And to be honest, I'd almost forgotten that he even existed. I had long been a fan of his work, and was particularly enamoured of Braveheart, which I considered one of the greatest historical epics I'd ever seen.But after his much publicised bad behaviour, including drunk-driving (which I find inexcusable) and rampant anti-Semitism (which I find intolerable), plus his apparent decision to focus on pushing an aggressively right-wing Christian agenda on and off the screen, I decided to unofficially boycott all things Gibson-related - a decision echoed by Hollywood, where he was blacklisted for the best part of 10 years. And I promptly forgot all about him.So when I reached the end credits of my new favourite movie and discovered that Gibson was, once again, the master director responsible for my awe and elation, I had somewhat mixed feelings.Gibson is, inarguably and undoubtedly, one of the best directors in the business, and he's a pretty fine actor too. I just wish it was easier to like and admire him as a person. I know that much of my opinion is based on media reports and tabloid brainwashing, and God knows I despise all of those people far more than I dislike Mr Gibson. But he has admitted to saying the things he said, and doing the things he did. However, I note (upon researching his Wikipedia entry) that he has also done a lot of philanthropic stuff too, so I guess he's trying to balance things out. I think I'll follow Hollywood's lead and give him a second chance. He's certainly talented enough to deserve that much.And Hacksaw Ridge is really a masterpiece of filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A brilliant telling of our awful history,"8 February 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Hacksaw Ridge. Everyone should watch films like this. Everyone should share the horrors of war and realise what this world has gone through, what people do to each other and how futile it all is. As the years go on we still keep discovering stories that need to be told and this was definitely in that category. Desmond T Doss was a Seventh-Day Adventist and a CO, a Conscientious Objector, who felt it was his duty to join up not to fight, but to serve in another way. Following the Lord's commandment to the letter telling him thou shalt not kill, he refused to touch a gun, instead demanding he be allowed to go into battle as a medic. Meeting all kinds of resistance he stayed true to his faith and his beliefs and what followed was truly remarkable resulting in Doss becoming the first man in US history to be awarded the medal of honour having never fired a shot. Comparing this film to Saving Private Ryan does both films an injustice. Hacksaw Ridge, in no way detracts from the horror of Private Ryan, but stands out as one of those truly unmissable films. Directed by Mel Gibson, who has done an great job in bringing this tale of heroism to the screen, Hacksaw Ridge, before the bloodshed starts, is almost comedic at times and you find yourself grinning along with Andrew Garfield's infectious smile. Vince Vaughn did a pretty good job in his role as Sargent Howell,and Hugo Weaving was brilliant as Desmond's Father. This is a tale of our recent history, it needs to be told and it must never be forgotten, men like Doss and his beliefs alongside all our military both serving, retired and those no longer with us are the reason we go to work in normal jobs and live our normal lives. Well done!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

It made me tremble and weep for an hour.,"This film tells the story of a man who is against killing people, even in the act of war. Yet his sense of patriotism and responsibility causes him to enlist. He insists on not touching any weapons, despite direct orders from seniors and even when he is face to face with enemies on the bloody battlefield.I have heard good things about ""Hacksaw Ridge"", but nothing prepared me for such a powerful and touching experience. Initially, I find Andrew Garfield's innocent and even goofy smiles annoying. I kept wondering why cast someone in a heroic role when he does not look like the typical hero. His constant smiles made me wonder if he took anything seriously. Yet, over the course of the film, I have learned that he is just the most courageous and loving person anyone could hope to find on the battlefield. His selfless acts even in the most adverse conditions are beyond words. His heroic acts radiates throughout the second half of the film. Just like his fellow soldiers, I judged him too early.I checked the time twice in the cinema, not because of impatience, but because I wondered how much screen time there was left. The film was so powerful that tears kept falling for an hour. My body trembled uncontrollably, and I just didn't think I could take the heavy scenes anymore.I remember the first fifteen minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"". The scene is now famous for being super gory and highly touching, that made it an effective anti-war message. In ""Hacksaw Ridge"", the battle scene lasted for an hour, and every minute of it is as intense as the most famous war films. There have been so many minutes in the battle scenes that I just could not open my eyes. Just listening to the men screaming, shells exploding and guns firing was already enough to make my body and mind completely entrapped in the soldier's hell. Tears kept falling, and every part of me hoped for a relatively good outcome for the soldiers.""Hacksaw Ridge"" is such an intense film. Every bit of it is superb. Even little things like the placement of bullet shells in the battlefield, and the final scene of Doss being lifted down tell stories that are not told in words. The very final scenes of the interviews with the survivors are very touching as well. To hear Doss recount his own experiences on the battlefield is certainly very effective and fascinating.This film is profoundly effective and emotional. Tears keep falling from my eyes. Even on the way home, as soon as I thought about the scene where all soldiers look to one side before going back up to the Ridge was enough to set my tears off again. Doss was such a valiant hero, he meant so much to the soldiers. Not only did Doss saved their lives, he saved the soldiers' morale as well.It is rare that I feel so much emotions during and after a film. It made me tremble and weep for an hour. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is truly superb.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

good but loud,"I can safely say I'm glad I saw this film for the truly remarkable and awe-inspiring underlying story. However, it was extremely loud and gory in the battle scenes. I had to cover my ears and look down several times. But the humanitarianism of the central figure and how he came to influence and change the minds of his fellow soldiers was remarkable. I believe both the film and Andrew Garfield deserve Academy Awards. The cinematography of the rural scenes was very good but I was simply astounded during the battle scenes. They were so realistic that many folks in the theater were exclaiming and jumping every few seconds. I was caught up and fearful and often shed tears. It was a very emotional experience for me both in sadness and joy. It truly told a story of the horror of war and one man's effort to help no matter what.

"Full of Story, Light on Style","Hacksaw Ridge is a good movie. If you're only curios if I recommended this movie then yes I do. But I will not say that this movie is as good as many people are saying.The movie is really cut into three sections (which nicely break this movie into the traditional three act structure quite well) which are the scenes before joining the military, the scenes of the main character at fort Jackson, and the titular battle of Hacksaw Ridge. To Be quite blunt the first two portions are really well done if a bit melodramatic in a lot of sections. The acting all around is really good, especially from Vince Vaugnh and Guy Pierce who kind of steal the scenes that they are in. However the story takes a strange turn once it gets to the battle the film was named for for chopping it up so much that a lot of the vital information is lost and has to be indirectly told to the audience such as: 1. How many people has he saved? 2. How long has he been up there? 3. How is he feeling during this time?Truthfully, what should have been its greatest moment turned into a confusing and totally bland montage that does little to enlighten the audience on the mental toll being taken on the character, the test of his morals under fire, and if his relationship with his God/religion ever waver during the hell of war. The worst bit is when Garfield's Character sneaks into one of the Japanese tunnels to help wounded men and then leaves. no real extended tension on if is caught, no mental dilemma about literally walking into enemy hands, it just happens.And that's the real on the movie, it fails to really add tension to what could have been an edge of the seat, heart-pounding, nail- biting, third act. Its more interested in showing what happened rather than to entertain which is not a bad thing but it is a facet that is better handled by documentaries than it is for a blackbuster with the goal to entertain.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Better than overrated & schmaltzy Saving Private Ryan; depicts true heroism & visceral carnage,"Awaiting Director Mel Gibson's return since the astonishingly hyper-real thriller Apocalypto, which was one of the best movies of the 2000 decade, I came to the movies on the day after Christmas, just when this movie might depart from the first-run theatre too soon.Needless to say, my reaction was that of astonishment, to some extent, in seeing the visceral horrors of the 'unimaginable' carnage of combat and atrocity, that indeed force the viewers to question mortality and that war is indeed Hell.Hacksaw Ridge is a spectacular war movie, that should compliment the varying classic wartime movies like All Quiet on the Western Front, Paths of Glory and Full Metal Jacket.However, due to the moderate budget that had to be funded by the sources outside the Hollywood system that basically blackballed Mr. Gibson following the scandals that are best left unmentioned, the unfortunate outcome is that the visual effect/FX looks dodgy in some combat scenes, that detract from the immersive realism of the horrors of war.Especially, in the gut-wrenching and nauseatingly visceral portrayal in this movie, the particularly ferocious battle between the American infantry and the relentlessly brutal and ruthless Imperial Japanese infantry on the southernmost Japanese-held island of Okinawa in the duration of World War 2, that was precipitated by Japan's unwise decision to attack Pearl Harbor, likely as a reaction to President Franklin's oil embargo and blockade that antagonized the Japanese to commit to total war, much to their regret given the Americans' fearsome and retributive resolve.I would go on the record to state that Hacksaw Ridge, despite some dodgy CGI effects of combat violence and gore that was, understandably enough, due to the moderately low budget in financing outside the unforgiving Hollywood movie studio system, accurately and unflinchingly depicts the horrors of carnage in the protracted battles, especially against the fanatically determined and heartless Japanese infantry.I have had read the history books on the horrors of war and occupation, such as Imperial Japan's brutal occupations of China, Korea and the Philippines as well as the accounts of the battles, notably the famous photograph of the flag-raising on Iwo Jima and what led to that moment. My father is an amateur historian of WWII Pacific Theater who interviewed the ancient surviving American soldiers of this theater, who spoke very negatively about the Japanese soldier that seem demonic and inhumane, which is true.With Hacksaw Ridge, through Mel Gibson's brilliant but otherwise almost imperfect (i.e. melodramatic scenes meant for establishing characters in order to explain the motivation -- especially why the humble yet unrelentingly non-conformist Christian protagonist chose to enlist only to be subject to violent bullying and hazing trying to force him to change his inexorably pacifist belief when he only wanted to serve as the mere combat medic) direction to show us how horrible the war truly is, it forces us to confront our mortality as well as ask ourselves the existential questions such as nihilism and suffering.This movie, for the first time in a long time (not even recent other violent and horror movies would bother me), made me queasy and aghast at the grand vision of carnage that infers the absolute inhumanity to one another, that invoked the philosophical questions of mortality.In many ways, Hacksaw Ridge is, in terms of pacing, storytelling, characterization and visual portrayal, the better movie than Spielberg's absurdly sentimental and turgid propaganda Saving Private Ryan, that went downhill after the opening battle sequence that was well-done in depicting the carnage on the massive Allied invasion of Normandy on D- Day.Furthermore, Hacksaw Ridge touches upon the utmost courage in face of adversity that include despicable bullying for holding firm to the pacifist belief in genuine religious principle, unbelievable heroism and absolute carnage, whereas Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line is merely philosophical that, while almost well-made (fantastically ethereal cinematography by the twice-Oscar-winning cinematographer of ""Braveheart"" John Toll) and well-meaning, was frustratingly esoteric, almost maddeningly inert, and apparently naive.Ergo, Hacksaw Ridge is certainly dissimilar to the aforementioned films Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, noting my complaints about these movies with their inherent flaws.Indeed, Hacksaw Ridge is one of the finest war-centered movies made to date, with all the right filmmaking and competent storytelling components that accentuates the true horror of war, with Mr. Gibson's insistence to show us that war is really hell, and that we the people should be thankful that the Allied soldiers fought valiantly for our freedom and liberty.I am the descendant of the grandfathers on both of my parents' side. I am the grandson of the former captain-ranked bomber pilot in the European Theater and the former Navy sailor in the Pacific Theater. My father and I saw this movie when we finally had the time to go to the movies, since he and I were busy with our jobs & other obligations.Hacksaw Ridge impressed us to poignancy, knowing that the horrific portrayal of carnage is exactly why our ancestors fought the unspeakable evil, especially the Imperial Japanese with their terrible love of violence and rape and so on, yet vigorously denied by the ultra right-wing nationalists in Japan.The Allied forces sacrificed their lives and limbs to ""save"" the civilization, and for that we must be grateful to them, including my grandfathers, so that we never have to experience the appalling horrors under the occupation by the despicable invading enemy.A grand comeback for Mel Gibson in redemption as the superbly proved auteur, since Apocalytpo and this film are the visually astonishing, compelling and unapologetically unflinching movies that depicts the morally tenacious and appalling human conditions in the duality of good and evil, with the latter film that portrays the doubtlessly truthful adage to its most effective extent: ""War is Hell.""3 1/2 stars out of 4",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The power of belief,"Hacksaw Ridge is an amazing movie, one of the best films of the year. First of its depiction of war and its horrors was masterfully done, the war scenes were horrifically gory, the use of visual effects and makeup were to a degree of brilliance in these scenes. As we follow the protagonist through and through the battlefield the horrors we see just so brilliantly reflects the horrors of war, from the rats and maggots eating away the deteriorating bodies to the bodies with their internal organs out, it was like a scene from a horror movie, which makes it all the more powerful as we as audiences understand that this is in fact the 'truth of war'. It was very impactful, most importantly the atmosphere that the film sets up for the war scenes are truly indulging, through the use of smoke and special effects I really found myself sort of 'lost' in the horrors of this battle. Everything were presented in a very realist way, I remember quite vividly the scenes in which the men would just lift their heads and immediately get gunned down to their deaths or how many of the men dies almost instantaneously, this idea of how easily a life could be taken did leave a large impact on me.Moving on to the actors, Andrew Garfield I believe gives one of the best performances from him ever, the way he portrays the character of Desmond Doss makes him such an inspirational figure, Throughout the film he never loses that sheepish grin,in contrast to his fellow comrades it is as if the war has not really left a toll on him. The way he still 'lives on' with that undefeated spirit of him was captured amazingly in Andrew Garfield's performance. It was a brilliant choice of casting Garfield, from his physique alone it would seem that he is perhaps lesser or weaker, which really helps emphasise on the character of Desmond, of how despite being weak his heart and grit may be stronger than any other. His spirit and firm belief in god is really fleshed out against his shortages in physical strength.Hugo Weaving also delivers a masterful performance, as an audience I could just see the internal conflict that is constantly seen on Weaving's face. The internal struggle was done so subtly, this is yet another brilliant entry from Weaving. Another brilliant performance which surprised me was from Vince Vaughn, it has been sometime since he has starred in a serious film and stepped away from comedy. In this film he was at times the comedic relief providing brilliant comedy one liners, but never dismiss his ability to act out those more emotional and serious scenes because in this movie Vince Vaughn really hits the ball out of the park on that side also.Overall the moral of this film was a great one and way portrayed very well. The power of believing, this man, Desmond truly and wholeheartedly believes in his god and the thing about this movie is how belief can be so empowering. Even when others did not approve of or agree with the way he depicts the bible and god, he stuck with it and that firm belief guided him and allowed him to save all of those people at Hacksaw Ridge. This film isn't necessarily a film about Christianity or god but more of the idea of 'believing in something', towards the end of the film there was a scene in which the men refused to storm Hacksaw Ridge without Desmond, the men did not possess the same level of belief as Desmond towards god, but they believed in one thing: 'Desmond Doss' and in turn their belief in him brought victory at Hacksaw Ridge. So the most important thing that I personally got out of Hacksaw Ridge was the idea of how important believing is, hey, believing alone can't accomplish anything indeed but if you apply belief to action then you could really cause a large impact.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best war film since 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN'!,"'HACKSAW RIDGE': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new war biopic set during WWII, and based on the life of Desmond Doss; the first conscientious objector, and American pacifist, to be awarded the Medal of Honor. The film was directed by Mel Gibson, and it's the first movie he's directed since 2006's 'APOCALYPTO'. It was written by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight. The film stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Rachel Griffiths and Hugo Weaving. It's received rave reviews from critics and fans alike, and it's also been a modest hit at the Box Office (costing just $45 million to make). I think it's one of the best war films I've ever seen!Desmond T. Doss (Garfield) was raised in Lynchburg, Virginia, by a very religious mother (Griffiths). His father (Weaving) was an alcoholic, due to his negative experiences in the Great War. After almost killing his brother, Hal (Roman Guerriero), while fighting when they were kids, Desmond becomes a very passionate believer in the Sixth Commandment. This becomes a severe problem when Desmond feels the need to serve his country, during World War II. After a great deal of harassment, and several obsessive attempts by his commanding officers (Worthington and Vaughn) to have him thrown out of the Army, Desmond goes on to save the lives of 75 fellow soldiers, as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa, and win the Medal of Honor.The movie has been praised by many critics as being the best war film since 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN', and I would agree; it's every bit as horrifically realistic, and violent, and it's also just as well made. I'm a big fan of Mel Gibson; as an actor and a director, but especially a director (and I've missed him over the last ten years). This film stands as one of his greatest; it's at least in the same league as 'BRAVEHEART' and 'THE PASSION OF THE Christ'. I'm also a fan of Andrew Garfield; he's my favorite Spider-Man, and I think he's a very talented and passionate actor. He's good in the lead, and Worthington, Vaughn and Weaving are all outstanding in supporting roles as well. What I most like about the film is it's message; it deals with a very passionate rebel outcast, who must do battle with nearly everyone else, and take on a lot of harassment, in order to stick up for his beliefs; and he does it beautifully. The movie is extremely moving, and breathtakingly beautiful; it's one of the year's very best!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GhHTPB4y30",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the best of the WWII film genre. Amazing.,"Hacksaw Ridge: I just saw it and had to write. I left the theatre in a deeply moved state. The film about America's only CO to win The Medal of Honor for heroism in combat is stunning in its realism and depiction of the horrors of the South Pacific Campaign in WWII. The story is true, and at the end of the film the real main character addresses some of the film's content. The special effects are incredible to behold, and the thunderous roar of the battleships' big guns is only topped by the barrage of huge explosions on Hacksaw Ridge. I was additionally attached to the film's content b/c my own father fought in three similar battles in the South Pacific in WWII. He never spoke of it. I only found out after his death in 2010 that he was awarded six medals during WWII and fought and survived three of the most savage battles in the war against Japan: Anguar Island, Peleliu, and Luzon. The film brings it all to you , and I realized that this is what my quiet, peaceful, unassuming father had kept to himself all my life. It is a film that you will never forget; congrats to Mel Gibson on another directorial success. It's a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Absolutely Amazing,I found this movie amazing. It had a beautiful story attached to it. The casting was well chosen. Definitely would pay money to watch it again.,,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A good old-fashioned war drama,"A good old-fashioned war drama about true-life young American hero in WW2 who didn't believe in killing a man or even holding a gun... but still wanted to serve his country so became a battlefield medic instead.He rescued a lot of fellow soldiers and got Medal of Honor without shooting out a single bullet. Starring Andrew Garfield – and before you google or IMDb him, yes, he's the current Spider-Man.Hacksaw Ridge doesn't really bring anything fresh to the war drama table. But it's not necessarily a bad thing because for all the clichés and simpleness it also manages to be one of those beautiful event movies which win us over by just how well they are put together in every aspect.The battle scenes are as brutal and eye-catching as expected but I especially liked how the movie manages to work on different levels.It reminds us that war was hell before it was all entertainment for the younger generations – but it also manages to be sweet and kind of feel- good, praising the good in our souls which can make us rise to the occasion and make the most of the bad situation. And, of course, action fans will not leave disappointed either.It's also amazing how soulful performances the actors offer based on quite shallow one-dimensional characters.Garfield is a true star here, giving his all as a boy not quite a man but ready to do man's job – all starry-eyed, idealistic and physically resembling a young calf at times – yet never giving up on personal quest to be worthy of own's ideals. You will totally buy him as a young American hero.The supporting cast is strong too, especially Hugo Weaving as the hero's troubled father and Vince Vaugh as sgt Howell.It is kind of ironic that after years and years of yawn-inducing talky roles in mostly mediocre comedies, Vaughn has found new calling in serious, violent stories such as ""Hacksaw Ridge"" and the mafia man in HBO's ""True Detective's"" season 2.This is also kind of comeback/renewal for Mel Gibson, one of the more likable movie stars from the end of 1970's to the beginning of 2000's.In the middle of 2000's, he suddenly stopped acting, directed two violent historical movies (""Passion of the Christ"", ""Apocalypto"") and turned from a longtime family man and father of seven to seemingly homicidal maniac, if we believe the news and notorious recordings made by his neighbors, leaked to web.He's returned to acting in 2010 but has been keeping lower darker indie- er profile ever since, so many of you have probably not seen him in anything new. Except maybe cameo-ing in Machete 2 and The Expendables 3. This time, he's ""only"" director and does a marvellous job at that, putting everything together and wringing the most out of the cast.""Hacksaw Ridge"" may not be remembered as one of the greats in crowded war movie genre but it's working beautifully in ts own right. Two hours well spent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fantastic film,"Okay. Yeah, this film is great. 100% worth watching, it works really well if you don't know the Doss story prior either. Acting, directing and cinematography all brilliant. My only real negatives are that the first half of the film felt longer than it needed to be.
Nothing much else to say, but watch this film if you haven't seen!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
War glamorized,"There's a certain charm about true stories adapted for cinema. Because, while the fiction lacks absolute constraints, giving the screenwriters more liberty and allowing for some laziness, true stories must remain true - and at the same time must be told captivatingly to keep you thrilled. Finding the right balance between the naked truth and the gloss of creative imagination to make the truth shine is a real art.However, some true stories don't tell us much besides what happened, omitting the ""how"" part. Such stories are basically legends, no matter how ancient or contemporary. And in this case, it's up to the movie creators to recreate the how, often not based on bare facts but on their own perception. And that, in my opinion, is what happened to Hacksaw Ridge thanks to Mel Gibson.Hollywood has made quite a few war movies, genres varying from dashing black humor like Inglorious Basterds to eerie surrealism like Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. Yet what Hacksaw Ridge reminded me of first was Malick's The Thin Red Line. Stylistically very unlike, both these movies still tell a story about the same war. And it only makes it more obvious how different are Malick's and Gibson's takes on that story.Malick's war was a useless and ugly thing, a notion that fills everyone's minds, transcends the boundaries between people's personalities and unifies people on both sides of the front line. It's a stain that lies upon you no matter which side you fight for, and corrupts you from within, to the point when there's no good and evil anymore and everything is a single grey mess and everyone is an equal part of it.But Gibson's vision is different. This man has been long known for his fascination with pain and violence, from the explicit focus on his own character's torture in Braveheart to the gory details of Jesus' fate in The Passion of the Christ. This man's obsession with showing pain and death on screen may raise questions about his morals or sanity, but at least he's being thorough and consistent with it.And Hacksaw Ridge was yet another proof of that. With all the beautiful healthy faces put in the middle of the carnage of war, with blood, guts and brain pieces splashing out of gun wounds like little fountains, with cartridge cases ejected from rifles and machine guns like some confetti, Gibson creates a hymn to the war, as if it was a holy gift, cleansing the unworthy and leaving the pure intact. And in the middle of that hymn, is the figure of Desmond Doss, portrayed by Andrew Garfield in a way Saint Sebastian would be jealous of, with his face glowing with some perverse naivety and conscious righteousness. The hybrid erotism and holiness of Gibson's vision of Doss are further enforced by two landmark scenes of the film: the scene with Garfield alone on that ridge, pulling the ropes and letting them loose, with his lean figure against the dark smoky sky, sensualized to the point you'd rather expect from the likes of 50 Shades of Grey, and the scene of Doss slowly sliding down the ridge in a stretcher, with a strong parallel to some divine experience you simply can't help coming to think of.Still, at the end of the day Hacksaw Ridge is a story of a real person who has performed an unbelievable feat in a middle of a true bloodbath, has done something that nobody ever expected of him. And that achievement is a fact that no director's vision could distort or negate. We'll never know for sure where the real Desmond Doss was taking his courage and strength from, and, to be honest, it's the kind of spiritual privacy a person is entitled to. But, private or not, I would still prefer the fact-based stories to follow their roots instead of becoming a victim of a storyteller's inflamed imagination. And while Hacksaw Ridge literally smells of Mel Gibson's own personal beliefs and tastes, apparently it's that rare case when the spirit of a story is so strong that, no matter how hard you twist it or bend it to your own will, it remains true to itself where it really matters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the BEST movies of all time!!,"I have watched a lot of movies, but not a single one is as good as Hacksaw Ridge. It is emotional, compelling, heroic, and entertaining. Mel Gibson did an awesome job directing this film. I have already watch the film four times and can't wait to watch it again. In my option Hacksaw Ridge is the best movie I have ever seen!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The only one's blasting this are those angry at the 'Christian' elements,"Ignore those that are giving this movie bad reviews because of the Christian themes in it (the lead actor is a Christian and there are allusions to the Bible and Prayer, etc.) That's to be expected these days. It doesn't matter how good a movie is, they'll chew it up because they are angry about anything in it that makes it references Christ in any shape, size form or fashion. How dare a movie try to cram Jesus down the throat of the viewer!...puuuulease! Gees, grow up and quit whining.So, ignore all of that non-sense and see this movie for what it really is; a great movie, with great acting, wonderful special effects (although very violent, so keep young kids away from it), the language isn't all that bad for a war movie and you even have a bit of a love story mixed in for the 'mush-movie' lovers (lol).You'll be glad you watched this movie, trust me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Very Interesting And Suspensful,"I have watched lots of good war movies in my life. The difference between a good and mediocre war movie is the difference of plots and the amount of action. When watching Hacksaw Ridge, you will jump out of your seat and ugly cry until the night is young. The emotional rollercoaster of victories and losses is the perfect balance of war and tranquility. There's bombs, soldiers, and bullets galore. There's also bravery, empathy, and heroism beyond compare. This movie is based on a true story of a soldier who single handedly saved the lives of many of his fellow soldiers in World War 2. The virtues and lessons of this movie make it a very interesting and enticing movie to watch.During a moment of weakness, we tend to feel that there is nothing that we can do that would ever make a difference. That even though we may have completed the task, it would never be as impactful as we had hoped. However Hacksaw Ridge reminds us that no matter how small a victory may seem, it can make some of the biggest differences. During one of the most pivotal scenes in the movie, Desmond Doss is confronted with a very conflicting issue. He finds that he can't bare himself to kill anyone in the very gruesome war that is surrounding him. There is a short moment of pure terror for him because he truly has no idea how he was going to help out for his fellow soldiers, and for his country. However, he finds a whole new task when he sees a fallen soldier in the battlefield, who has no way of getting back to safety. In the spur of the moment he decides that he is going to save all of the men who cannot save themselves due to major injuries. He sacrificed his life to save ll of the soldiers that he did. Even though he wasn't fighting on the field, like he was intended to, he single-handedly saved 75 soldiers during that war. His story is one that people will remember for a very long time, and his nobility and sacrifices are what makes this movie so impactful.This movie also has a great way of balancing dramatic scenes with calmer ones. It blends the two together seamlessly and leaves the viewers crying from laughter then screaming in terror as a character they love gets thrown into peril. That's another great thing about this movie. The director wasn't afraid to put the main characters into a vulnerable position. In a typical war hero movie, the character or ""hero"" is usually seen as the almighty person who could never be defeated. However the roles can be completely reversed in this movie and it is very refreshing. In the movie you have the actor who plays Desmond Doss, Darcy Bryce, who is known for his emotional, yet impactful performances. He brings just the right balance of wit, strength, and vulnerability to really pull of the role of Desmond Doss. In a few particular scenes during the war, he has a sort of inner turmoil going on inside of his head that is narrated throughout the movie. These narrarations let us know that he is truly scared for his future, and this adds not only to the seriousness of the situation, but also to the overall performance. Hacksaw ridge isn't your typical war story. You get to see first hand, what it's like for the hero to lose a battle, whether it be a physical or mental battle.Hacksaw Ridge is not for the faint of heart. Yes, there is a little something for everyone in the movie including comedy, action, and heroism. However it sticks to the original story, which is a gruesome one. This movie is for those who seek a good hearted war story that has a historical background. Hacksaw Ridge stays true to the original events that actually happened, and this promotes an honest and wholesome story that everyone can learn from. The act of selflessness can be a pretty hard topic to try and cover, because it is such an expansive topic, and people tend to just brush off the idea or purpose of it. This is because it's hard; people don't want to put others safety and well being in front of their own. However I think it's something that people could really learn from, and I think that Hacksaw Ridge portrays the true meaning of this really well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

the source material helps overcome some of its more familiar elements,"Biographical war movie from director Mel Gibson tells the story of Desmond Doss, a WWII veteran, Army medic, and steadfast conscientious objector who--despite the danger, hostility, and disrespect it brought upon himself--remained true to his principles and refused to bear arms, even while witnessing the firsthand horrors of war during the bloody Battle of Okinawa. The film chronicles his early days on a farm in Virginia, his strained relationship with his father (a traumatized WWI veteran), his enlistment, training, and eventual deployment where he saved the lives of countless fellow soldiers despite his pacifistic nature. Script is full of conventional elements, and no doubt you've seen similar characters and depictions of battle in plenty of other films, but all of the performances are good, the frontline war scenes are compelling, and the source material gives it added weight. **½",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Much of the first half of the film is fiction,"A purported biopic of Desmond Doss, a Seventh Day Adventist conscientious objector in World War II who served as a medic during the war. The movie is based in Virginia, South Carolina, and the Maeda Escarpment (""Hacksaw Ridge"") in the Battle of Okinawa.The movie opens with dramatic battle images from the Battle of Okinawa. Then we meet Desmond Doss (Darcy Bryce/Andrew Garfield), his alcoholic father, Tom (Hugo Weaving), his devout mother, Bertha (Rachel Griffiths), and his brother, Hal (Roman Guerriero/Nathaniel Buzolic). As youngsters, Desmond and Hal fight a lot. Desmond almost kills Hal with the brick; this experience solidifies his belief in not killing another human. On another occasion, he prevents his father from killing his mother.Desmond's assistance at an accident leads to his interest in medicine. He meets Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer), a pretty young nurse. Desmond and Dorothy get engaged despite his fumbling ways, just as Desmond has decided to enlist in the army to serve as a medic. At Fort Jackson in South Carolina, he refuses to use a weapon, despite extensive harassment by Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn), Captain Glover (Sam Worthington), and other privates. At one point, he is imprisoned and court-martialled, though intervention by a General releases him to training as a medic.The second half of the movie switches to the battle for Hacksaw Ridge, and we see excruciating battle scenes in which Desmond's bravery is evident, making everyone aware of how they have misjudged him. Finally, he is also injured and evacuated.This is a Mel Gibson movie. This means much of the first half of the film is fiction. Desmond Doss never hit his brother with a brick, his father never took a gun to his mother, Dorothy was not a nurse when she met and married Desmond, Desmond was never court-martialled or imprisoned though he did suffer harassment. Having largely created a story from whole cloth, Gibson then provides some of the goriest battle scenes you can imagine, many of them having little to do with Desmond Doss. We even get to see the Japanese officers at the battle commit hari-kari when the Americans finally win.More than one reviewer wondered what Desmond Doss, who refused Hollywood's pursuit in his lifetime, would have thought of this film. He died in 2006.The film does articulate some of the issues that conscientious objectors to war face in philosophical and religious discussion, but any meaning is mocked by Gibson's blood and gore.This is the 14th in my list of movies about pacifists/conscientious objectors.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Explosive heroism,"This review of Hacksaw Ridge is spoiler free**** (4/5)As an actor Mel Gibson has gained a fair few roles to get him slightly noticed since his alleged racist tirade seven years ago but they are nothing to praise it was very difficult for him to get his name on another Hollywood production since some studios wouldn't hire him. But since his stunning Best Picture winning debut Braveheart Gibson isn't stupid as he knows exactly what he is doing behind the camera, over the years his films have not just made him a director to watch he's become the director to cherish. Its been 11 years since his last shot behind the camera with 2006s Apocalypto, but it's fair to say that the Australian, earned that time off as his fourth film Hacksaw Ridge seems to be the thing that every Gibson fan was looking for. This fourth shot walks the tightrope without any sort of wobbling the film; it may even lead to Oscars.We first meet the film's centre character Desmond Doss, as a young boy living a happy yet troubled life with his older brother, his mother and his abusive father (Hugo Weaving) who constantly teaches him the differences between rights and wrongs, it's later in this opening that we see what his father is doing to him. Then the film shifts 15 years to a more grown up Desmond, whose troubled young life seems to only be a memory that has left him, it's here that we see he first instance of his heroism when he saves a misfortunate soul. He meets with Dorothy Schutte who happens to be the best catch in town; they form a relationship together using his charm. Though Desmond gets the idea that he wants to join the war which is when the message comes clear that his father doesn't want him to end his life so soon as he tells him about his story of World War I of how he lost all his friends, when he finally says with tearful eyes ""I lost all my friends, I don't want to lose my sons as well"" but Desmond is determined that he will come back home unscathed.He decides to go through as a combat medic; he refuses to hold a rifle as he is against violence but when it comes to heroism he shines. The second act when he starts his training it doesn't take itself too seriously as there is moment that is very funny as the drill Sergeant (Vince Vaughn) gives all his men new hilarious nicknames and gives us a few zingers, but it's not horrendously misplaced. Desmond spends most of his time as the army's punching bag he is constantly beaten up arrested for his beliefs yet his determination doesn't whither which is when we see his full strength. The opening of the second half is when Gibson's vision truly comes to life as we veer into the battlements of Okinawa, Japan (filmed in Australia) like his three previous films there was always a moment when the violence would keep its this film does essentially the same thing. Doss and his teammates are engulfed by a cascade of bullets, a huge body count, explosions and puddles of blood. He still shows determination as he has to save some of his comrades, it takes time to show this happening but it's still impacting nonetheless. Unfortunately the film does flag a little perhaps due to the times of territorial overkill when the fight becomes long, and at points never seems to halt.But it's all essential stuff as this is a time when Hacksaw Ridge becomes a Gibson film when he gathers all his expertise into one scene. His transitions through the two different flanks are all wonderfully adept. When the battle finally halts there is a gorgeous shot of a slender Desmond running through the battlements to save some of his teammates, it turns into a stealth mission, but it's beautifully done. In addition, his superiors call him a hero. Granted the film flags and it seems this film Gibson not just the director to watch it makes him the director to cherish. Hacksaw Ridge is essentially this century's Saving Private Ryan.VERDICT: Garfield and Palmer are phenomenal, in this sensational biopic that shows heroism and justice that's heavily impacting, truly moving with Oscar worthy performances and a lot of heart.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A True Hero...,"In the midst of World War 2 young man, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) is prepared to give his all for his men, without touching a gun.This movie surprised me, it was a breath of fresh air. Going in this movie you must understand that it's brutal and savage, it depicts war at it's fullest and not just the physical pain but emotional too. We follow Desmond a real life war hero who follow the commandment ""Thou shalt not kill"". We see him struggle to get a girl and finally to be one of the brave warriors who will fight at Hacksaw Ridge. He undergoes brutal training and even becoming and outcast among his fellow soldiers. The scenes depicted here are hearth-breaking and hard to watch. The movie is excellently shot, with great visual effects and beautiful angles. Cinematography was breath taking and the acting was phenomenal. Andrew Garfield surprised me greatly, he brought so much power to this character and I must say I liked him better here then in Silence. Mel Gibson gives so much to this movie, he let's these actors express themselves, the emotion is dripping from the movie. Hugo Weaving...I have not seen him in a long time and he left me speechless, I was taken in this so much. Teresa Palmer was also really good, maybe one of the best performances of her carrier. The war itself is almost horror like, the way it's shot and depicted is scary. You can feel the tension in every scene, I was on edge the whole movie.

An emotional and brutally beautiful film,"I was worried that Hacksaw Ridge was going to be preachy, but instead I found myself completely caught up in this emotional and brutally beautiful film. Andrew Garfield does a great job of making you think he's both completely foolish and totally reasonable as Desmond Doss. This is the story of one man sticking to his convictions, while allowing others the same privilege -- and I really appreciated that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Different !,"I liked Hacksaw Ridge simply because it is different. Most of war movies cover certain aspects of war, like the courage of men fighting for their countries, the horrors of war or the psychological effect of war and difficult adjustment to civilian life. All are great aspects that have been displayed in movies like Saving Private Ryan (Dir. Steven Spielberg), Full Metal Jacket (Dir. Stanley Kubrick), Apocalypse Now (Dir. Francis Ford Coppola), Platoon (Dir. Oliver Stone) and Paths of Glory (Dir. Stanley Kubrick).Hacksaw Ridge covers all these aspects, it shows courageous men fighting for their cause on both sides (Americans and Japanese), it shows the horrors of war and how men can be cruel and savages killing each other and blowing each other into pieces, it shows the psychological effect of war and how hard it is to get back to normal after living the horrors of war and after watching your friends die (displayed by Desmond's father who came back from WWI a different man, drunk and violent).But to make the value of human life the main theme in a war movie? That's new! War, by definition, is a man trying to kill as many soldiers of the enemy as he can. Desmond here doesn't kill and doesn't even hold a weapon, he appreciates human life, he knows that all life is precious, he doesn't kill as many as he can, he saves as many as he can from his friends and even form the enemy! He was as courageous as any man in that war, maybe even the most courageous of them all, because it takes a whole lot of courage to rush into war without a weapon to defend yourself! Some people would even consider that suicide.Hugo Weaving gave a brilliant performance portraying Desmond's father with all the scars war left in his soul. Mel Gibson is a master director who knows exactly what he is doing. He has Braveheart (1995), Apocalypto (2006) and now Hacksaw Ridge (2016) to prove it.Hacksaw Ridge is an important thought-provoking movie, with some mind-blowing action sequences and heart-breaking emotional moments. Definitely one of the best movies in 2016 and one of the best war movies ever.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A wonderful movie full of emotions,"My opinion---""Hacksaw Ridge"", is an extraordinary film and is in itself a marvel of its kind. Mel Gibson was able to showcase all his talent as a director with this masterpiece, as well for having exploited this true story of: Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield who is Extraordinary and deserves the Oscar for the best The role of men), of his early youth, following all stages, becoming at one point in his life a conscientious objector until his involvement in the army until the end of his history. The Doss unit is assigned to the 77th Infantry Division and sent to the Pacific War Theater to participate in the Battle of Okinawa. Mel Gibson was able to give a soul to his film, despite the harshness of the war scenes, they make us discover battle scenes extraordinary realism even so stunning, these scenes are incredible realism, I These scenes surpass the scenes of the Normandy landing of June 6, 1944, of the masterly film ""Saving Private Ryan"", that's saying a lot. This story is also full of humanity despite the fact that any war will always have its inhuman side of nature at its core. It is precisely Mel Gibson's strength that he was able to describe the story of this most simple hero who especially wanted not to flee his military responsibilities in the face of the war, despite his initial convictions as a non- Violence, and it was precisely here that was the paradox of his story, he just wanted to care for and save his comrades in arms, without being dependent on a weapon and having to kill. He wanted to be a soldier, but simply as a combat nurse. Mel Gibson also pointed out the union that end up having all the soldiers towards each other To this incredible story Mel Gibson has made humanity in inhuman situations, but that everything is real, because no war will ever be validated as necessary for humanity. In my life, I had never seen so much realism in battle scenes, I would have believed myself and experienced them every time, what a horror for all these soldiers in this hell, Wow, I Sigh again. Mel Gibson is really super good and he put a bar so high for this kind of film, that this time to exceed the height, I do not think it will happen one day. A film unheard of in all its history and history, that of an antihero of incredible modesty until the end of his life, for him the true heroes were all in military cemeteries. When we saw this film, it was in springs full of all the emotions and feelings that knew how to imbibe in us.

A formidable anti-war film elevated by a sublime performance from Andrew Garfield,"Hacksaw Ridge is a formidable anti-war film that's closer to popular war films like Saving Private Ryan and Platoon than anti-war masterpieces like Full Metal Jacket and Paths of Glory. The film is elevated by sublime performances from Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, and the lovely Teresa Palmer. Mel Gibson is certainly back with a bang and seems to be following the footsteps of Clint Eastwood. All we need from Gibson now is a Revisionist Western. Speaking of Gibson, his choice of including the archive footage of Private Doss and other survivors from the Battle of Okinawa helps add a lot of weight to the film.With as many as 6 Oscar nominations to its credit, Hacksaw Ridge is certainly one of the biggest films of the year. Apart from the brilliant screenplay and direction, it is Garfield's performance that makes Hacksaw Ridge what it is. 2016 proved to be an incredible year for Garfield who delivered not one but two great performances-- the other being his turn of a stoic Jesuit Priest in Martin Scorsese's Silence. It's an interesting coincidence that in both these films, Garfield played a Christian pacifist. A real pity is that Garfield didn't get a second nomination for his sublime performance in Silence which is even better than his brilliant turn in Hacksaw Ridge.Hacksaw Ridge looks set to win the Best Editing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing. A win in any other category would be a real bonus.For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog ""A Potpourri of Vestiges"".",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hits and misses: Expected better,"The film is a bit of a mess.It tries to hide that mess behind an unassailable righteousness of valiant service to the state, but if you take in all of what Hacksaw Ridge puts out there, that sloppiness shows through.It's largely just another exercise in pushing all the ""right"" buttons to create something designed to get and keep your butt in that seat. And that's OK, as long as you understand that's what you're watching.Bright notes: There is some good stuff in the flick; glimmers of good writing and scenario work. In general, the interactions between the lead and his fellow trainees and ""betters"" in the barracks was a passable stretch of decent film writing, directing, acting.But too many balls get dropped. This largely shows up in scenarios where folks have to get down to speaking the truth about things. A good example of this is the court martial scene, where the writing and sequencing is muddied to the point where you feel a little insulted the writers figured you wouldn't notice.Yes, there's all that interminable battlefield action, and indeed it does make it difficult to hold a narrative product up to artistic standards while men are being blown to smithereens at a mile a minute.But... in the end, it *is* a movie. And it *does* all too often seem to want to hide a paucity of honest scenario work behind its sundry blockbuster bonafides, like the man-faces-death thing and the boy-meets-girl thing.I suppose where this all comes from is... this is sometimes what you get when you have to stretch one basic--and interesting, surely!--story idea over a two-hour run-time.You can riff off that one story in interesting ways, but in the end you're really just watching one story idea being developed. Whether the exercise was worthwhile comes down to how the writers (and downstream production participants) made things come alive in spite of that ""limitation"".I'm saying I was a little surprised to see such an otherwise *very* well-meaning enterprise--telling Desmond's story--drop too many balls and produce something marred with a certain amount of artlessness.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Sharknado of War Films,"Sat through the turgid cheesy opening half expecting some decent war film action in 2nd half. From the over the top stepping through heads and entrails to the never end stream of slowmo shots of machine gun shooting while screaming, it made Tropic Thunder look like Apocalypse now. Yes it is based on true events but really, is this the way to portray true heroism ? When the Thin Red Line exists, from the same theatre of war, which depicts the reality in a much more gut wrenching way. Who thought Vince Vaughan could play a tough drill sergeant, who thought up the dragging through the mud, rear gunner style machine scene could be taken seriously, who thought the scene of a soldier volleying a grenade away was anything other than laughable, probably the same director who stole all the component parts of other war films and stitched them together into a parody that is totally unaware of itself. I would go so far as to say it is an insult to the genre. It gets a 3 based on some technical flair and the heroics of the true story.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The stuff real heroes are made of,"Andrew Garfield does a good job playing real-life hero Desmond Doss, a guy who during WWII refused to touch a gun and ended up saving 75 wounded soldiers. Seems too incredible to be true, and yet it happened more or less as shown in the movie.The first part of the narrative establishes Desmond's character as a gentle but determined soul. The love story with Dorothy is sweet without being cloying (a good love story being a real rarity in movies nowadays). The middle part in the barracks introduces Desmond's relations with his comrades and the third is even more gruelling than Saving Private Ryan opening scene.Yet the carnage needed to be shown, to enhance Desmond's bravery. Someone complained about the Japanese being shown in ""a bad light"", however, as a soldier thrown into a bloody battle I don't think anybody would have felt inclined to getting to know the enemy better and treat them with more respect. Fear was the name of the game as it was trying to survive at all costs.Definitely a good war movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Welcome back Mel,"Mel Gibson is certainly a director of considerable talent, and excusing his brushes with scandal, he is still a man who knows his craft and exudes a confidence on screen. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is his first directorial effort in 10 years, and although at times the films fails to reach it's full potential, it's still a reminder that Gibson isn't someone we want banished from Hollywood.In a time when it feels like World War II movies have been tired out, here comes another one that tells the true story of Desmond Doss. Unlike most soldiers, Doss is a Seventh Day Adventist who refuses to go against the 10 Commandments, particularly the one against killing. Enlisting to serve his country, his only slight is that he will not touch a gun. At first he is told that this will be acceptable. Boot camp certainly proves him wrong.This is a movie that is told in two very distinct parts: the blossoming romance on the eve of enlistment, and the hellfire of battle itself. When you think of a war movie you must introduce the characters as everyday people. Doss is raised in Virginia, son to a drunk and lover to a nurse at a nearby hospital. On their first date he can't help but stare at her in the dark, ignoring the newsreel footage of battle. In another film that black and white image would be enough to spark Doss to enlist. Instead, he just smiles and smiles and wonders whether he should kiss her or not.We see the fragments of why he is so against violence. His father (Hugo Weaving) who at one time lost his friends in World War I, is now a raging alcoholic who takes out his anger on both wife and kids. His only solace is the cemetery where his friends are now buried. Guns are expected in war, but in life, Doss sees them as a tool to only incite destruction. When so many people arm themselves to fight, he decides to work as a medic to try and save people instead.Boot camp sees all the typical scenes one might expect, including peer bullying, obstacle courses, and a barrage of insults from the drill instructor (Vince Vaughn in a curiously non-comedic role. His performance and delivery of lines is astonishingly bad in an otherwise fine cast. This is the first true time I can honestly say that an actor was absolutely miscast). As he continues to refuse weapons training, Doss is thrown in a military prison and threatened to be locked up the duration of the war. We know he won't be, but it's still required in the film to establish the drama of the scenario.As I said, the film is very clearly two stories, and part two hits the audience like a freight train as the nightmare of battle manifests on screen. Gibson, the director whose battle scenes in ""Braveheart"" are still considered some of the best of their kind, knows how to film action. The left-to-right path of the allies move across screen at Hacksaw Ridge; a precipice of mud and trenches on the shores of Okinawa. Taking this fortress means changing the tides of war. The battle which is filmed in extended sequences that truly are horrific, show blood and gore the likes of which we haven't seen in a war film in quite some time. Steven Spielberg didn't necessarily revolutionize war films with ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but the intensity certainly hearkens back to it.Doss is remembered as having saved nearly 100 wounded soldiers from the battlefield when all other troops retreated. Through the night and into the next day, he worked to slowly drag men from the mud and lower them down a 50-foot cliff to their salvation. It's almost too fantastic to be a true story, and yet Mel Gibson himself said he was drawn to this story because it was about ""a real life superhero without the spandex."" After the war Doss even became the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor.The film (nearly 2.5 hours) wraps up so quickly that it felt like a 3-hour movie that was missing the final reel. A quick montage shows the final moments of the battle and show some incredible real-life footage of the elderly men who actually knew Doss. Aside from some moments of cliché (how can a war film ever seek to be original when so much has been seen) and that brisk wrap-up to such an unbelievable story, I still would recommend the movie. Andrew Garfield in the leading role is at times a bit too hammy to demonstrate the depth a character like this would have, although such selflessness is maybe 100% accurate. I was happy to learn a bit more about one of America's unknown heroes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Masterpiece,"This is the 'Saving Private Ryan' of this decade. No it's not star studded like Ron Howard's film is but I think that makes 'Hacksaw Ridge' feel more authentic in a way. While I did enjoy all the major stars in 'Saving Private Ryan' I feel like a film made up of one big name star surrounded by a cast of lesser known actors and actresses let's my mind focus more on the story instead of the people playing the characters. I don't know, maybe that's just me.
I have never a biography or self biography of Desmond Daws or any official documents about the events of what happened at Hacksaw Ridge, so I don't know how true the entire movie is or if they changed any details to make the movie better, but I love this movie! It is a must watch if you love war movies. This has to be on your list of Memorial day or Veterans day movie marathon (if you do that kind if thing) I love turning on AMC or the History Channel and spending the majority of the day on Military Holidays watching war movies and thinking about my Relatives that Served in the Military. Now there is a lot of blood and guts so if your sensitive to that kind if thing, be prepared for that from the get go. There is a pretty sizable degree of Religious overtones so be ready for that too if you are a non Believer in GOD. I am a Baptist so I love the Christian message that the ending sends. I don't want to ruin anything so I won't go into the what the message is. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Long boring movie,"A war movie for me is difficult to make. Making one side morally better than the other, it became propaganda. Even though the movie tried not to focus on the war, rather the life of the miracle man, Mr. Doss, himself, I felt it was too long to take. The first half of the movie is just for the background of him, and I felt it was unnecessary. You can literally enter the theater an hour late, and still wouldn't miss the point. I believe this story is true and give so much respect to Mr. Doss for what he have done. But while watching, my mind was asking what American doing there in Japanese territories. Maybe I am not American so I was not so much into the movie. But, ironically, the director, Mel Gibson is not American either. For me, this one is just another long boring movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
complete waste,"I've to tell you I left the movie before the end. We were forced to watch the war. The movie was very light in the inception. We expected a comedy type movie when Vincent Vaugh appeared first, conversely the movie turned out to be a complete blood bath. When war started, I worried that when it will stop.I completely could not resist the war and left it. Also one guy has automatic rifle on one hand and he is holding a dead torso of other man. You do not see this sort of action even in Bollywood movie. The very first opening was a disaster with ships bombarding the fire and bombs. You can do animation however too much animation simply kills. Instead of a full bloodbath, the movie could be made a war comedy as it was difficult to be serious and the main character still cannot lead the movie. Hope we'll not have to see this sort of movie often however this movie started to get good votes. The war scene was unnecessary. At one point it was not clear whether I was watching a X Box game or a movie. The movie timing simply dragged on without any substance.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"On the battlefront, his intention was to save the lives.","The film was awesome, mainly because of the good message it carried out. That's not it, the film was well made with the wonderful cast and their great performances. The special effects were top notch, as well as the location where the majority of the second half takes place. This is a US-Australian co-production. Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs.It was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events. It tells the story of an American youngster named Desmond Doss, who joins the army to contribute to his nation. But for his religious point of view, he struggles during the training. After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge.The story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.He did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.He was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die. But appreciable effort, at least from the Americans perspective. A true hero for his nation. One of the best war films ever. Instead of saying a must see film, I would say don't miss it.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Great war film,"Probably the subject ""pleases God"", at least I hope so.

The fight scenes and the explosions are perhaps the most well done of all war movies (except the war documentaries...) All due respect to Simon Duggan which is signing the Cinematography. All the actors are exceptional. In particular I liked the two actors which are the parents of Desmond Doss: Rachel Griffiths and Hugo Weaving.

An Emotionally Powerful Film,"This film blew me away in all the right ways. I admit I cried a few...well more then a few times. What sells it for me is the superb acting by 4 people in particular. Andrew Garfield was outstanding, a completely different role and a real showcase of skill compared to the disappointing Amazing Spider-Man series. He portrays Doss beautifully in a way I think he would approve of. Watching him go through the struggles to become what he is and staying true to who you are and what you believe was what made me quite emotional throughout. Vince Vaughn, goodness what a surprise. He needs to be in more roles like this rather than the stale, run-of-the-mill comedies he often stars in. This is an entirely different Vince Vaughn that we rarely get to see. I was at first legitimately intimidated by his performance in a good way. As the film went on you see he's not a bad guy. As a whole Vaughn does a great job portraying such a complex character, that I thought he would never be able to pull off, I'm glad to say, he surprised me. Sam Worthington, going from the cocky but respectable Jake Sully in Avatar, to this powerful performance. He isn't in the much but when he is it is a delight to see. And lastly, Hugo Weaving, again like Worthington he isn't in it much, but he adds some mustard to this spicy film, and is different from what we are use to. Not make-up riven, just classic and wonderful on-screen acting. The film as a whole is beautifully done and Mel Gibson shows he can direct. Say what you will about the man, but he can direct. The music by Rupert Gregson-Williams is heartwarming, and the on-screen action is riveting. What else is their to say, I loved this film, and teaches self-worth in a way no other film has done.

"A movie split in two, where one part outshines the other.","While not as stylistically done as Full Metal Jacket, this movie is also clearly split in two. The first part of the movie covers the training, and the second one the war itself. I was not too fond of the first part (though it did have some fantastic moments), but the second part was so intense that when the movie was done, you have forgotten about most of the beginning of the movie.There's something inherently difficult with movies like this, and it's unfair because it's not a fault of the movie itself. There's been made so many American war movies that portray an exaggerated heroic narrative, without any nuance, nor feeling that you are watching something that actually happened. Many of these movies were really good, but the tradition has led to me always being skeptical of these movies, especially when they say they are based on a true story. Now, Doss was a hero, and he more than deserves the portrayal of him in this movie, but it still feels hard to trust.The first part of the movie is about the all American boy with an abusive father, deciding to do what he thinks is right. It really does feel like Mel Gibson proposing to the American audience. But, in between the rosy red scenes of wholesome American life, there are some really good moments. Hugo Weaving is incredible in this movie, and he steals every scene he is in. Especially a scene where the family is eating dinner, and he reacts to Doss' brother enlisting. Fantastic acting.The second part of the movie, though, is great. From the Forrest Gump-like American boy in the training camp, it throws all the characters into war, and demonstrates beyond any doubt that war is hell. It's graphic, hectic and terrible, and it's impossible to look away. Despite everything happening at once, the movie manages to show what happens, and give you the feeling of being out there, and share a taste of the reality these young men were facing. And to think that this happened every day, many places, for years. They are all heroes, but the latter half of the movie is not so much about the glory (except some slow-motion sequences in the end). Which is how the heroes should be displayed. As (sometimes unwillingly) brave humans thrown into a situation beyond comprehension. And doing it because they believe it's the right thing to do.The movie is worth watching. The historical inaccuracies are there, but they don't seem to be too major, and Doss was actually even more of a hero than what ended up on the film. The latter part is really good, and Hugo Weaving makes the first part enjoyable as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A daring and inspiring break from the conventional celebration of heroism,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAs World War 2 draws to a close, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) enlists in the military, much to the disdain of his embittered former vet father (Hugo Weaving.) However, he wishes to serve as a medic, and, owing to his religious principles, refuses to bear arms. Initially, he's dismissed as weak and spineless by his comrades and commanding officers, and is even made to serve some time in jail, but on the outbreak of the Battle of Okinawa, he comes to earn respect and admiration from his former deriders, as he risks his life to ferry injured men over enemy lines and to safety, saving many lives.At a time in his career when he has more credibility behind the camera than in front of it, Mel Gibson has helmed this promising and inspiring tale, that was rich in potential for a big screen dramatisation. Essentially a turning on the head of all the traditional war-time yarns of righteous infliction and gung-ho machismo, this relays a story of incredulous truth, almost in the 'fact is stranger than fiction' league. And, thankfully, it hits all the right notes at just about all the right times.For a wartime film, it spends surprisingly most of the first half focusing on the human drama unfolding at home and later in the army regiment, as Private Doss is tested for his beliefs by his peers and superiors, giving lead star Garfield the chance to display his dramatic range and capability, and he just about manages to carry the film perfectly. In the later stages, the horror and unrelenting impact of the battleground come terrifyingly to light, in a Saving Private Ryan style portrayal that is just as blood soaked and realistic as Spielberg's film.Above all else, Gibson has delivered a searing examination of a different type of courage, measured in individual conviction of beliefs and an unwavering moral devotion to them, the sort that probably wouldn't have been appreciated as much in the days of John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The acting, writing, and directing were all phenomenal, but a characteristic that is often over-looked is cinematography. The cinematography in this movie is incredible. The battle scenes in this are also amazing. I never been in war, but if it is anything like this movie it is truly hell on earth. Mel Gibson has never been hesitant when it comes to brutality and gore, and this movie is no different. I felt like I almost needed to take cover behind my couch watching this, as bullets were going to fly out of the TV. There are also some truly suspenseful moments as well. This movie is an A+, best war film since ""Saving Private Ryan"", and I felt many aspects in this film surpassed it. Whether you think Hollywood should forgive Mel or not, that's another debate, but it's a fact that this man is one of the most talented movie makers out there. Hacksaw Ridge is raw evidence of this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mel Gibson knows how to direct a war,"Mel Gibson is a great actor but I've never seen any of the movies he's directed. Hacksaw Ridge shows Mel Gibson's talent at directing.Hacksaw Ridge follows Desmond Doss, an army medic, who refuses to kill people and manages to become the first person to earn a medal without picking up a gun and firing.Whilst this film isn't perfect, it's still a very intense experience that tells a story that's hard to believe. The first half is quite cheesy but when you get to Hacksaw Ridge, that's where the film really takes off. This is where Mel Gibson really shines. He clearly knows how to direct a war. The war scenes are really well shot whilst being incredibly gripping and gruesome. It's interesting how the film starts off with a very lighthearted love story and goes on to become a really graphic and brutal war film where limbs are blown off and a whole multitude of dead, bloody bodies are shown. There was some CGI present during the war scenes which didn't look so good but the war sequences are definitely the highlight of the entire film.The performances were great also. Andrew Garfield has been on a roll and his work in Hacksaw Ridge is terrific. The film does a good job setting up the beliefs of Desmond Doss and Andrew Garfield makes it very believable. This is the best I've seen Teresa Palmer and she has great chemistry with Garfield. Hugo Weaving and Vince Vaughn were also good and Mel Gibson was able to get a good performance out of Sam Worthington which is commendable.Hacksaw Ridge does work. It may not work as well as war classics like Saving Private Ryan but it does the job. The performances and Gibson's spectacular direction make Hacksaw Ridge a worthy watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
War are not just about the killing,"Finally a war movie that is not just about the killing. All this while, the focal point of a war movies was to end someones lives and in this movie it's about saving others instead. Andrew Garfield played the part really well. It have everything, the suspense, the comedy, the drama and the action. Thumbs up to Mel Gibson to this another master piece under his belt. The story line was nicely arrange and was not rushed. Although the screen time was more than 2 hours, you didn't feel like it when you go to the theatre as when the movie played you were brought together with the timeline. Again, a touch of a genius.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the bests from Mel Gibson and Andrew Garfield,"One day I randomly hopped in a theater to watch a movie and it happened to be Hacksaw ridge. Though I am not a big fan of war or patriarchy films, I was intrigued by the story line and how well Andrew had performed, It wasnt until end credits rolled that I realized that Mel Gibson had directed this master piece.I might not watch this again, but this definitely is a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Truly a work at its best,"I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a 
 year because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.
The movie was simply astonishing as it shows the sacrifice and strength persons endured and each part well portrayed by the cast lineup sending the message of the movie and history so clearly. I truly must commend the movie was well in order",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
