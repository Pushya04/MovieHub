Mike and the Mirthmobile,"The cultural references of Wayne's World may date it a bit, but the nature and personality of its humor set it apart. There is a kind of naive benevolence and boundless joy which makes this movie so lovable. Its aimless plot and exaggerated humor are cute, without ever transcending that barrier into maudlin sentiment. This is a difficult mix to achieve, especially when so many comedians go out of their way to achieve ""street credibility"" through as much forced vulgarity and stereotypical humor as possible. Campbell and Carvey's characters were the ultimate comedic anti-heroes for generation X, even more so than Jay and Silent Bob, Bill and Ted, or Beavis and Butthead. They championed amateurism, paraded self-affecting humor, and became worshiped for telling everyone they weren't worthy. If '60s pop culture encouraged people to ""do your own thing,"" Wayne and Garth were the genuine article in the '90s. Two complete geeks had fun acting as themselves, and became celebrated in the process. One of the true comedy classics of our time. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen...NOT!!,"WAYNE'S WORLD is actually one of the best SNL-inspired comedies ever made. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are way cool as Wayne and Garth.  It's just shameful that the movie contains mostly wasted music...HYUH, RIGHT, if monkeys fly out of my butt.  I think it the music here is excellent.  Tia Carerre is hot as Wayne's love interest, and Rob Lowe does a fine job as the con artist who buys Wayne and Garth's show.  Believe me, it's worthy.4 out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Good clean nineties fun,"I've always found Mike Myers to be something of an acquired taste and struggle to warm to his work. Wayne's World is the one exception, and surely the highlight of his career. The film is fairly novel in its design and has a lot of very witty moments. Dana Carvey is arguably the star of the show, playing the uniquely amusing Garth to perfection. Tia Carrere and Rob Lowe round out a pretty strong cast with decent, if slightly cheesy, performances.I would agree that the film has aged a lot since its release, but it serves as a cultural reference point and will remain a very nostalgic and enjoyable viewing experience for people of a certain age. The subversive takes on mainstream films become a bit tiresome and the love triangle story is a little corny but this is not a film that needs analysing in great detail. A fun movie, with its own unique vibe and styling.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Party On Is Right,"Wayne's World (1992)*** (out of 4)Highly entertaining big-screen version of the Saturday Night Live skit has best buds Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) partying and doing their public television show without much stress in their lives. This all changes once they meet up with a crooked producer (Rob Lowe) who decides to exploit their show. WAYNE'S WORLD isn't one of the greatest movies ever made but it's certainly charming and funny enough for what it is. I'd also say it's safe to say that this is one of the better SNL transitions to the movies and a lot of the credit has to go to its two stars. I think both Wayne and Garth would be downright annoying characters had the performances been off in any way but both Myers and Carvey really took these guys and made them, at times, stupid but also very charming and just the type of people you'd want to hang out with. There are all sorts of funny moments throughout the picture but the real highlights deal with the boys and their interactions with other people. Lara Lynn Boyle as Wayne's ex-girlfriend gets all sorts of funny moments as does Brian Doyle-Murray who ends up being a sponsor who gets on the wrong side of Wayne. There's also Ed O'Neill in a small role as well as Meat Loaf and Chris Farley. Also on hand is a terrific bit from Alice Cooper who nearly steals the film with the performance of ""Feed My Frankenstein"" and the hilarious backstage access where he talks about Milwaukee. Lowe also deserves a lot of credit with his comedy here as he's perfect as the snake in the grass. Even Tia Carrere does a nice job. Director Penelope Spheeris does a very good job at keeping the film moving at a very good pace and there's no question that she knows how to stage the various bits of classic rock music throughout. Fans of the SNL material are certainly going to eat this up as its as fresh today as it was when it was first released.",,Anonymous,Music
Schwing!,"Remember how wildly popular this one was when it came out? ""Wayne's World"" didn't completely live up to all of the hype, but it's not a bad little comedy. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are great as Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar, co-hosts of a basement-based cable access show. The duo seem to have it made when their show hits the commercial airwaves, but there might just be something sinister behind it all with executive Benjamin Kane (Rob Lowe) in charge.""Wayne's World"" is not generally uproarious, but it certainly has its moments (the backstage scene with Alice Cooper, portraying the leather-clad rocker and his bandmates as political sophisticates, is hilarious). Myers' act wears a bit thin as the film proceeds, and the ""serious"" stretch in which Wayne seemingly loses his girlfriend and best friend just doesn't fit. But even when it's not funny, ""Wayne's World"" is usually reasonably entertaining and charming. Carvey's bizarre Garth is one of the highlights, along with some memorable parodies and writing.Based on the popular ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch, ""Wayne's World"" is definite period piece of the early 1990s. Its catchphrases (""... not!"" and ""Schwing!"" among them) were repeated millions of times over by teenagers. It spawned a less-successful sequel, and although there was talk of a third installment, it's almost a certainty we've seen the last of Wayne and Garth. Nevertheless, party on!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Cult Classic!,"As a middle-aged lover of world and art-house cinema, the lovably goofy Waynes World might seem an odd one for me to like and enjoy.I've never owned it myself but as it's just been on Channel 4, I thought I'd see it once again, to see how it still fares. Though it's far from being my favourite movie of all time, it still hits the targets its designed to and manages to smell sweet when compared to the more recent torrent of comparative sewage that is hailed as gross-out 'comedy'.Oddly, perhaps, it's impossible to dislike or find the two (Mike Myers and Dana Carvey) super-geeks annoying. The film is bright and breezy and rolls along like a continual Friday night out and the rock music references, including the famous Bohemian Rhapsody sung in their tiny car, always welcome.The dream women in their lives are indeed good-looking girls and their portrayal are a fair balance between teenage male hormonal fantasy and real people with substance and character.Considering Waynes World is supposed to be a Cult Movie, I'm surprised how few reviews there are here, on Amazon. Whether new audiences will ever warm to WW is a different matter altogether but for of us who's seen it come, go and now hang around, it still offers many pleasures.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hey, At Least We Laughed","As an older guy watching something geared more for a younger crowd, I would sit and watch this almost shaking my head in disbelief that I WAS watching this....and usually having a good time. It's brainless, but fun, like Mike Myers' stupid grin.The humor is really stupid, silly, crude at times, innocent at times but funny many times. All that adds up to is an an hour-and-a-half of entertainment, so at least it succeeds in what it's trying to accomplish. So, even if it is far from a classy comedy, so what? How many are these days?I can't knock something - even if this dumb - that makes me laugh. Apparently a lot of people agreed as it produced a sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Time capsule material proves need for ""best scene"" Oscar","Ask most men within a decade of my age in either direction to list the 100 best movie scenes of all time, and the scene from ""Wayne's World"" where they sing/lip sync Bohemian Rhapsody in the car will be on more lists than not. It might even make every list. Not designed for the ""critically acclaimed"" snob set, Wayne's World, the film adaptation of the extremely popular Saturday Night Live skit by the same name, targets its audience perfectly and never even enters the water, let alone jumps any sharks. The movie is true to itself from start to finish.The bedrock of the film, as well as the skit, is the unbending friendship of Wayne and Garth. Most children have one best friend who stands out above all others, and there's no mistaking that Wayne (SNL alum Mike Myers) and Garth (SNL alum Dana Carvey) have that type of friendship. The best friends host a cable access show in Aurora, Illinois, also sharing the skit's title. Other SNL alums, such as Brian Doyle-Murray (Noah) and Chris Farley (a concert security guard), round out the cast.The plot centers around an opportunistic television producer named Benjamin Kane (Rob Lowe), who, with funding from an arcade owner, turns Wayne's World into a slickly produced national show, causing it to lose touch with its audience, and causing friction between Wayne and Garth, who feel they have sold out their fans and their roots. A love interest is tossed to Wayne in the form of Cassandra (Tia Carerre), in triangular form due to the attention paid to her by Kane as well as Wayne.The pop-culture cuisinart responsible for most of the SNL skits was working in overdrive in this film, and that's a good thing. Everything from product placements, to gratuitous sex, to lame plot devices were lampooned. Rob Lowe was excellent as the sleazeball junior television executive, while cameos abound from the rock world, including Alice Cooper and Meat Loaf. Though not publicized as much as the other quotables from the movie, my personal favorite scene was when Wayne and Garth were each laying on parked cars, and Garth starts whistling the closing theme from Star Trek.SNL-based movies have been hit-or-miss since their inception, but this was unquestionably a hit.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Here's What I Think,"I never saw the bit that led to this movie. It's my belief that a movie should work for someone, even if they are not familiar with the source material. For instance, we shouldn't have to read ""Pride and Prejudice"" to enjoy a film based on it. I do like Mike Myers and Dana Carvey. The use of local cable was an opportunity for those with some creative energy to get time to put their ideas out there. Now it's You Tube or streaming. There are several bits in this movie that are hilarious in and by themselves. But without a true center and a ""script"" it is just a compilation. There is no real story here. I know that some of the previous reviewers call those that don't like this ""snobby."" I believe what they are saying is that they don't like anyone really seeing what's there and putting an intelligent set of criteria on it. This is a silly movie and very funny in places.

"20 years old—which makes me middle-aged (why, God, why?).","Wayne's World—which it's hard to believe is two decades old this year—still provides me with a good time, Mike Meyers' unique brand of surreal humour still managing to tickle my ribs, the music still causing my head to bang (only perhaps not quite as hard), and Tia Carrere still making me wanna go 'Schwing!' . I don't know how much of this enjoyment is down to nostalgia—I was a metal/heavy rock fan in my twenties when I first saw the film—but my kids seem to enjoy its random, scatter-shot craziness just as much as I do, despite not understanding many of the 90s cultural references (and, thankfully, some of the more 'adult' humour).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for being able to whisk me back to a time when torn jeans, mullets and rock music ruled (I listen to BBC Radio 1 these days and I silently weep for the modern generation).",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Never cared for their skit, but their movie was okay.","I thought this was mildly amusing, much better than most SNL movies not that it is much of a race mind you. This one stars Wayne and Garth as they do their thing and finally get recognized and offered their own show. There is also a girl rocker that is in this one a bit to much as the problem with both this film and its sequel is the presence of Tia Carrera. One has to believe that Mike Myers had a thing for her as she was to much of a focal point of both movies. She was attractive, but she could not sing or act worth a crap. Still, there are funny bits here and there like their speech on how they would never bow down to sponsors and the ending which had multiple parts to it. Also rather funny, a scene where they get pulled over by a cop looking for someone. Though for all the funny stuff that was in the movie there were also a lot of cringe worthy jokes that did not work at all, much like your typical SNL skit that has gone on to long. Saturday Night Live may have made some of the better comedic actors, but most of the films based on their skits suck, while this is an exception as it does not really suck, it is just a mild comedy that is just a longer skit that has flashes of being rather funny, but in the end rather forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I laughed my head off!

have some interests since neither can hold down a job for long.But Sammy Glick like advertising executive Rob Lowe doing one of his heel type

If you miss this.... you really won't have missed anything.,I am now in my early thirties and cannot for the life of me believe that when this film came out in 1992 I actually thought it was funny. Thank the Lord my taste in comedy has improved since then! the only good bit in the whole film was the Bohemian Rhapsody bit but that is only because of the fact that Bohemian Rhapsody is a Queen song and I love anything by Queen who are still one of the greatest Rock bands of all time even now years after Freddie Mercury's untimely demise. The jokes are lame and far and few between and the acting is only marginally better. There is a touching and thoughtful scene on a car bonnet but that is the only other best bit in the film. I have given it two stars because although the awful script was written by Mike Myers who has thankfully gone on to do MUCH better with the Austin Powers films the acting of the leads was almost makes the film watchable. If it were not for the fact that they somehow managed to get loads of famous people into the film including Aerosmith then it would get just one star from me.

Fun Movie with an Interesting Delivery of a Message,"Now I'll admit something to start, I loved this movie growing up. My sister and I would watch this regularly as it always was on the movie channels. It is one that I learned more about as I got older and looked more into filmmaking. What I did know is that this is quotable from the jump, I thought Mike Myers and Dana Carvey were hilarious. Rob Lowe and Tia Carrere were great as well. I did get Jaime to watch this so she could understand some of the odd lines I'll drop.The gist of this is that we have Wayne Campbell (Myers) and his best friend Garth Algar (Carvey) with a public access show. Their dream is to do it full time, but until then, they have day jobs. It is an oddball show that people around their age love. Benjamin Oliver (Lowe) sees an opportunity to buy it and exploit it. There's not much more to it.If you don't know, this is a Saturday Night Live skit that grew into something more. This was that era where Hollywood was taking the properties and expanding it as they were bankable. What I will admit is that this isn't as good as I remember it. I'll admit, it was high up there so that is part of it. This is still socially relevant though. We see the problems of capitalism on an interesting scale. It makes jokes about corporate America taking things and ruining it. We are seeing the dangers of advertising and selling out. It is all done in a tongue and cheek way.I still find Myers and Carvey funny here. Lowe is great as this slimy corporate guy. Carrere is gorgeous. I like seeing Brian Doyle-Murray, Kurt Fuller, Colleen Camp, Chris Farley, Meat Loaf, Robert Patrick, Alice Cooper and Ed O'Neill in cameos.

Rock-Themed Comedy,"Who knew that a rock n roll comedy would be this hilarious? Wayne's World is one of the most funniest comedies of the 90s. Yes this is the kind of movie that does not take itself seriously, but it has been executed well thanks to its clever writing that provides with a solid story that allows the duo to play around a TV studio they upgraded their show for, hilarious characters, great direction that provides both the logic and the comedy seem fun to be in, and entertaining song covers coming from Tia Carrere. This is the comedy I highly recommend, especially for rockers. I know there are certain people out there that aren't like me and are truly into rock music. I'll say that even people with other favorite music genre will enjoy this if they ever want to watch a comedy like this.

Yeah ... sure ... it's fine,"I think the reason that Mike Myers career has been so hit or miss (mostly miss after the 1990s) is that he doesn't really make movies with plots so much as movies with extremely thin plots used to string a series of gags together. If the gags don't work, there's nothing left to make the movie work at all.Here it pretty much works. I found this movie to be significantly less funny than I did in 1992, but a lot of that has to do with it's daringness having been worn away by frequent imitation. Myers still hits with a pretty high frequency and I find the film to be amusing.What doesn't hit much at all for me is Dana Carvey. That's not a problem with him, but more with this character which is really thin and really repetitive. I can't say much better for Tia Carrere who's stuck with a thin character and a truly godawful band.Who is really great is Rob Lowe.

"Nearly 20 years later, Wayne and Garth still party on","Despite being supremely silly and immature, the timeless duo of Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar manage to make ""Wayne's World"" and later its sequel two of the only redeeming movies based on ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches. Their lack of street smarts and schoolyard antics play with a lovable innocence and, more importantly, a self-awareness. It's clear that although the film is basically about two guys horsing around, the talents behind it were doing anything but.The '90s had a very tough time shaking the '80s, at least as played in the movies, and ""Wayne's World"" captures this awkward transition whether intentionally or not. Mike Myers and then-""SNL"" writers Bonnie and Terry Turner wrote a movie that operated in a very forward-thinking fashion at the time but was trapped in a sea of '80s clichés and long-haired metal rockers. If the point was in fact to poke fun at those still clinging to the age of ""excellence,"" consider it received.Wayne (Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) are two dudes living with their respective parents who host a public-access television show in Wayne's basement called ""Wayne's World."" When Benjamin, a sleazy TV executive (Rob Lowe), flashes money and promises of fame their way, they sell out without realizing it, and when Benjamin starts making a play for Wayne's new babe, Cassandra (Tia Carrere), he and Garth must learn how to stand up for themselves.Myers and Carvey are held responsible for making this unexciting premise entertaining. Their ability to both convincingly play and make fun of their characters, sometimes simultaneously, has few rivals. Carvey in particular makes Garth one of the most lovable characters in a comedy of this kind. Garth's intelligence is matched only by his naivete and you can see both in Carvey's performance at all times. Wayne and Garth's fondness of innuendo also captures that hybrid of witty word play and complete immaturity that makes the humor tick.The magic of ""Wanye's World"" stems from being an everyman's comedy. The way Wayne and Garth (especially Garth) talk to the camera as if they've simply taken a camcorder to their insignificant but fun-filled lives makes them relatable dudes and establishes that the movie's humor is not manufactured to make us laugh, rather it invites us in for a shared comedy experience that is not above any viewer. Few comedies have done anything similar and been funny; 90 percent of them rely on contrived jokes and situations. The breaking of the fourth wall (to use the professional term not fitting of a movie like this) and the awareness of Myers and Carvey really sell us on this idea.In truth, only a few moments of ""Wayne's World"" have laugh-out-loud potential, but that's fine. It doesn't need it and it doesn't ask for it. And for a movie with a completely bare plot that does enough to give its characters something to do, it still works somehow thanks to the way it takes jabs at those very conventions. That's probably why 20 years later, it's just as easy to watch this movie and enjoy it even if you didn't sit down with the intent of really watching it.

Everyone everywhere was quoting it and it was in a way a part of pop culture, a bit like Austin Powers, another Myers film, became half a decade later on. Just like Austin Powers this is a very funny and iconic 90s film.The acting is good and Wayne and Garth are relatable and believable characters. Rob Lowe puts in a very good performance, and there's some nice and funny cameos from the likes of Alice Cooper. The ending never fails to make me crack up and the hit to miss ratio is very high. Great music too! You really feel included as the audience with its constant talking to the camera, some fourth wall break jokes in films fail miserably but here they pretty much all work. There's a lot of good in-jokes in the film too.

Party On Wayne!,"Wayne's World (1992) -It is a juvenile comedy and while it doesn't really measure up to 'Shrek' (2001) or 'Austin Powers' (1997) for their more witty and thoughtful delivery, it still has a charm all of its own that essentially comes from the lead character of Wayne, played by Mike Myers.He is joined by a fantastic supporting cast, some of them in very small cameo parts, but all playing for the laughs well.Because of the nature of the film, it is easy for them to take the Mick out of the situations and themselves and to some extent the audience as well.I like the breaking of the fourth wall, which is done cleverly and only by the two leads for the most part, which makes you feel included in the joke and Wayne and Garth's ability to change what they don't like, or take you in to their own little piece of the story, helps to make connections with them easy.They aren't essentially the most cultured or traditionally ""intelligent"" people and they could potentially be unlikeable, so having access to their deepest thoughts helps you to empathise with their journey.Of course we all know the scene in the car, headbanging to 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and it's little bits like that which help to show you what's important to them and how easy going life can actually be if you just enjoy it.Rob Lowe is divinely beautiful and he is brilliant in this role, even though he's playing an @sshole. He is just what his character needs to be.Also the conversation with Alice Cooper is so out there that it is genius.I can imagine that they all had a real laugh on set and enjoyed every minute of making the film.It's a simple story and some might say that it's not worth making, but it always puts a smile on my face, which is definitely worth something.711.24/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Classic rock and rollish film,"For those who don't know the movie, it's a 90's comedy starring Mike Myers and it's based on sketches from Saturday's Night Live performed by the main actors themselves.Wayne's World is about two rockers, Wayne and Gart, somewhat stereotyped but very charming, who have a modest open television program. A television producer (Benjamin) discovers the show and contacts the boys to buy the rights to the show to bring it to a wider audience, to which they agree, but eventually realize Benjamin's intentions.The film is full of references to rock and heavy metal music, it even features the appearance of the legendary singer Alice Cooper who plays one of his hits in one scene. But in addition to that, it handles in a very intelligent way the conflict that exists between corporations and artists, especially in a matter of integrity. Although the film has in its characters many of the stereotypes of that time about rockers, the truth is that it does so in a distinguished way and is never really bigoted, you can even identify with the characters on more than one occasion. Finally, it is full of absurd humor and surreal situations.An important detail that I would like to emphasize is that I do not recommend watching the film dubbed, since many of the jokes are not understood by the dubbing (puns for example) and humor is lost a bit. Even so, it is still a very enjoyable film with scenes that are already emblematic of comedy cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

kids go mental,"Penelope Spheeris (also of the Decline of Western Civilization Series and Suburbia) was chosen as the director of Mike Myers and Dana Carvey's SNL creation.

Wayne's World reveled in this new ""alternative rock,"" music a concept which was at the time much more flexible than it is now.

"Dana Carvey was born on June 2nd, 1955","Dana Carvey was on Saturday Night Live (SNL), from 1986 to 1993. Mike Myers was on SNL from 1989 to 1995. During his tenure, they both did the Wayne's World sketches, about, 19 times. They were both still on the show, doing the Wayne's World sketches, when the idea of making the skit into a major motion picture presented itself in 1991. Paramount Pictures confidently wanted to do it. Lorne Michaels was set to produce it and Mike Myers wrote a script, based off of the characters, that he initially created. Just like on television, Mike Myers would play Wayne Campbell and Dana Carvey was Garth Algar. The decision to take the television skit and move it to a higher medium, in this case the movie theaters, was reflected in the script.A television producer, Benjamin Kane (Rob Lowe), decides to buy Wayne and Garth's show and exploit it. The jump from TV to the movie theaters in real-life, is mirrored by the plot idea, that the show will go to an even bigger venue, by jumping from Wayne's basement studio to a more professionally run, actual television studio. Wayne meets a woman, named Cassandra Wong (Tia Carrere), who also gets a music contract from Kane. She and Wayne begin to romance each other, as their new TV show begins to take shape. The chaos, silliness and iconic driven, highly quotable, catch phrases ensue, through a story straight from Mike Myers' crazy mind. One of the clever cinematic devices, that is used in the film was, the characters would look straight at the camera (breaking the fourth wall), to talk directly to the audience.My experience with this film took a long time. I was unable to watch Myers and Carvey's runs, during their years on SNL. I, more or less, knew who Carvey was from other productions he had done over the years, other than SNL. He is actually eight years older than Myers, who I didn't really get to watch, until he did the Austin Powers movies, so my exposure to Myers came after the year 2000. I've been catching up with these two guys and their work on SNL, thanks to DVD releases or on YouTube, ever since. Since the release of this film in theaters, I saw Wayne's World (1992), sparingly, in bits and pieces, but didn't get the chance to sit down and watch it, from beginning to end, until recently, for this review. Watching it today, presented a more interesting point of view for me, seeing it, finally, as it goes over 30 years old.With age, I feel, the film has reached a new level, because it does represent an influential moment in film history. It has mostly become an iconic film and was one of the more successful SNL theatrical spin-offs ever produced. The comedy is still fresh and it fits in with the time period that the film was produced in. It's a good thing I was alive, when this film was produced, because some of the jokes might fall on deaf ears in the 21st century. I also felt that the end of the film became a little bit choppy. It shows slightly that Myers had a problem coming to a conclusion for the story. However, he does use a clever way to rectify that problem. Wayne's World (1992), is not a great film. I am more of an Austin Powers fan. However, you can't deny the fact that, Wayne's World (1992), plays a huge part in pop-culture, in film history and its overall impact on the world of comedy. It is a strong film though, worthy of repeat viewings. I also learned, that Dana Carvey is a skilled musician too and he really can play the drums that well.7.1 (C MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the most overrated movies I've ever seen,"This movie was made before Mike Myers knew how to be funny. His comic chops were not at the standard that we are accustomed to. When originally made, this movie was 45 minutes long. I can see why. There's just not much of a redeeming factor while watching this movie. I felt like I wasted an hour and a half. Dana Carvey, in my estimation is not, and has never been very funny. His brand of comedy may have worked years ago, but it does nothing but put a damper on an already awful movie. For those of you who wasted 8 or 9 dollars on to go see this, I am truly sorry. For those of you who buy this movie? I truly feel sorry for you",1.0,Anonymous,Music

The jokes were weak, and there was too less funny stuff. But I think that the reason is one main thing: MIKE MYERS!!!! I mean, it is the exact same feeling with the AUSTIN POWERS-flicks. Nothing that's that extremely funny, but something that get's hilarius, even though it is very corny and silly.I don't know what it is he does. Even though the extreme difference from the AP-movies, in storyline, the movies has a lot in common.

It's okay,"Acting:
Of course the classic characters for some of mike Myers and Dana carvey playing two goofballs. They do well at making these characters who they are. They're similar to that of dumb and dumber and I really can't complain.Story:
Here's where I find it not that great. It's a movie that has 0 seriousness and breaks the 4th wall constantly. That's fine except the story is just really bad, cheesy and being funny is no excuse for bad writing. There are funny moments here and there. Some are a bit too goofy and unfunny but overall that's not the main issue. The issue is that it's hard to enjoy and expierence a movie when the story is pretty boring. This would of been great if the story was just as good as the characters.Summary:
Now overall I think this movie is only for a particular group of people. Otherwise I can see someone hating this or someone loving this. If you like stoner films or just goofy comedies than you should enjoy this. If not i would give this one a skip.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Brilliant comedy!,"Wayne's World is undeniably a great comedy, Dana Carvey and Mike Myers were entertaining in the TV show skits but in the film they really shined. The music in this film is absolutely brilliant and timeless. The acting is good and everyone really seems to enjoy being in the movie. I cracked up at many of the scenes in the film, it serves it's purpose as a comedy so well. The head banging scene is one of the most iconic film scenes from the 90s. Loads of iconic quotes in the film as well, some of the lines still pop into my head to this day. I think the IMDB rating should be a little higher, it's definitely the funniest film of 1992 and possibly all of the early 1990s.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Ten years later, not really dated, still full of laughs!!","On one hand, it's all been done before (see: Excellent Adventure, Bill and Ted's) but on the other hand, great writing by Mike Myers and hilarious skit acting by both Myers and Dana Carvey make this film really funny. It has its ups and downs, but in the end it's a tongue-in-cheek, often satirical laugh-fest. And it gets done without a need for overly juvenile humour (although it is there;)What really bothers me is Tia Carrere's acting. What bothers me more is Tia Carrere's (?) singing (if it's her) And Rob Lowe's wooden acting doesn't help much either. If Myers and Carvey weren't so good, Carrere and Lowe would bring this film much deeper into comedy hell.This film spawned classic scenes; the Bohemian Rhapsody scene, the hockey scene, the studio' show scene (great product placement;). But overall it lacks something that even humour can't pull past. It simply works better in skit-form, one thing that Bill and Ted's definitely surpasses Wayne and Garth in is that it flowed more smoothly from beginning to end without lapses. Still, there are enough laughs to keep this one out of the gutter, and most of the other SNL based movies can't claim that (most shouldn't even *exist*)Look for great cameos by Meat Loaf, Alice Cooper, Donna Dixon, Ed Al Bundy' O'Neil, Blackhawks great Stan Mikita and Ione Skye, plus a hilarious and different role from starlet Lara Flynn Boyle.Overall: well worth watching, and has so far stood the test of time.

Waynes World,Wayne's world is a wonderful movie! I have seen this film countless times and it is still funny every time. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey play two dimwitted head bangers with their own cable access show called Wayne's World. When an evil producer (rob Lowe) wants to put WW on national television Wayne and Garth refuse to sell out. All the while Rob Lowe's character (Benjamin) attempts to steal Wayne's girlfriend Cassandra (Tia Carrere) during her music video shoot. This movie is full of dim witted yet clever jokes. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey disappear into their characters as Wayne and Garth and do an incredible job at captivating audiences and bringing about non-stop laughter.,9.0,Anonymous,Music
"A very silly comedy from the early '90s, but certainly not one that has failed to make me laugh","I was, well, under the age of six when this movie based on a series of ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches came out, but remember seeing some of it probably not long after it came out on video, even though it's not a family movie (mind you, I didn't pick up any of the vulgarity). I can't really remember anything from that viewing other than the suck-cut part. It wasn't until about three years ago when I finally watched the whole thing for the first time, and while it may not have been as entertaining as I had hoped, it was still fairly amusing. I watched the entire movie for the second time just last night, and I think it was pretty much the same this time.Wayne Campbell is a headbanger who still lives with his parents in Aurora, Illinois and has a whole collection of name tags and hair nets, obviously from previous jobs he has failed to keep. However, he does host a popular public access TV show called ""Wayne's World"" from his basement with his best friend, Garth Algar. Their show has been seen by Ben Oliver, a TV executive, who knows how popular it is, and wants to have it on his network. So, Wayne and Garth soon find themselves doing ""Wayne's World"" professionally, now on a basement set in a TV station, and it looks like they'll be making a lot of money doing this. However, the two headbanger friends are headed for trouble! They don't realize how sleazy Oliver is at first, and conflict between Wayne and Garth soon arises. In addition to that, Wayne has trouble with his girlfriend, Cassandra (lead singer and bass player of a local band), who may end up with Oliver instead of him if he's not the one who gets her musical career off the ground!Make no mistake, this is a very silly and rather juvenile movie, but silly and juvenile certainly doesn't necessarily mean not funny. Personally, I can't remember exactly how much I laughed the first time, but the second time, I definitely got a good number of laughs, even though it stumbles a bit at times. Wayne and Garth (played by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey) may have trouble staying consistently funny throughout the film's entire runtime (it's obviously harder in a movie than in brief sketches), but for the most part, they succeed, sometimes reasonably funny and sometimes VERY funny, saying some bizarre things. If lines like ""Turn it off man, turn it off! It's sucking my will to live! Oh, the humanity!"" amuse you, this could be your kind of movie. Certain minor characters sometimes add humour to the film as well, such as the freaky doughnut shop manager, Glen, played by Ed O'Neill. I also can't forget the beautiful Tia Carrere as Cassandra. With this role, she got to show both her acting and singing skills. Overall, this 1992 hit comedy's highlights are not exactly enough to make it a classic, but if you want silliness and rock music, you'll find plenty of that here.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Best Mike Myers movie,"Mike Myers has a talent for picking horrible movies to act in. Other than this, Austin Powers, and Shrek, has he been in any good movies? I mean, the Love Guru? Honestly, Mike? Was this a punk? Please tell me Ashton Kutcher was behind that. I can only be glad, I guess, that he started out in SNL, and did stuff that was actually funny. If not for SNL, Wayne's World, and Shrek, I honestly might believe that the Michael Myers from the Halloween movies might have a better sense of humor than this Mike, albeit a twisted and violent one. I have a feeling he would be a dead baby joke type of person. But Im rambling.Anyway, among all the Mike Myers movies, this easily the best. It is so off the wall and unexpected that you can't help but laugh, if nothing else, and the quirkiness of the film endings. I mean the Scooby-Doo ending? Extremely close up? And of course the shpeel involving corporate advertising. How can this not make you laugh hysterically?Not of all the movie is that good. But these sub-par elements are so minor in the film's context that they don't detract too much. For instance, the plot is paper thin. The movie seems to follow more of an hour and a half SNL skit (which, granted it was based on in the first place) rather than an actual movie format. And while some SNL skits have been turned into pictures on the silver screen, very very few of them are successful. (truthfully, how many of you could figure out a way to expand the Schweddy Balls concept to 90 minutes. Thankfully, this funniest of all SNL skits hasn't been desecrated by an extended storyline.) This stupid analogy was simply to explain how some skits, while side-splitting in six minute micro-doses would drag on and on if they tried to be expanded beyond their parameters.Again, these severely restricted plots work better with this sketch than they would with almost any other, because the sketch itself is just so incredibly random. It has no problem going outside the parameters, because there weren't really any parameters or limitations to contain it. So while the plot is very limited, by no means is it fatally so. I also have the sinking feeling that any big plot added to the script would have dragged it down. It has an eclectic feel. Nothing is focused, and it leaves the jokes (and there are plenty) even more funny, because they come out of nowhere and are just so off the wall.Mike Myers has a lot to do with this. The other characters don't add much of anything, except for Garth, but hey this is about Wayne, right? Mike Myers takes absolute control of the script, comically driving it on and on, in a flurry of hilarious relentlessness. (Did that sound really stupid, or was it just me?)So, while it's not perfect, Wayne's Workd is much funnier than most other comedies. It is also one of the few movies where factors that so often worsen a film actually improve the comedic aspect, at least. And with that being the point of a comedy, I am certain it is absolutely true to say that Wayne's World is a genuine success.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The plot is weak and the humour is very much hit and miss but it's self-awareness is perhaps its biggest strength,"Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) are best friends who host their own show called Wayne's World from the basement of Wayne's parents home. Wayne and Garth enjoy hosting Wayne's World and are pleased when they are approached by TV executive Benjamin Oliver (Rob Lowe) who promises the 2 men fortune and fame in exchange for a TV company buying the rights to Wayne's World. This new set-up initially works well, but it quickly causes friction in the friendship between Wayne and Garth as well as the relationship between Wayne and his new girlfriend Cassandra (Tia Carrere) when Wayne suspects that Benjamin has ulterior motives when he tries to promote Cassandra's band whilst simultaneously promoting Wayne's World.It's been quite some time since I've seen Wayne's World and my memories of it were much fonder than my opinion of it now. It's clear when watching Wayne's World that the plot and story never really feel that important; there is a story here but it always feels like its hovering in the background rather than being front and centre in the film. To me, this never really mattered that much because outside of the story it contained many things that made me laugh (the scene where the gang are singing Bohemian Rhapsody together is probably one of the most memorable scenes and did make me laugh). Wayne's World also has a wonderful sense of self-awareness about it (the whole parody on advertising and product placement was actually pretty clever and shows that the film is more than just a string of dumb-ass sketches). The chemistry between Myers and Carvey is also top-notch and whether they are bickering or mucking around together they are always a joy to behold. The film is also endlessly quotable and is probably responsible for popularising several things (the likes of 'We're not worthy' and 'Schwing' have been re-quoted multiple times since this film has been released).Although there are quite a few positives to this film it does have some negatives to it; the humour is very hit and miss and there are also aspects of the film that don't really work too well - Wayne's barmy ex-girlfriend and Garth's obsession with some hot woman are aspects of the film that aren't funny and don't particularly serve any purpose in the story. It's fair to say that there are lots of things that happen in Wayne's World that don't serve much purpose, but when the pointless stuff is funny then it's fine, but if something's pointless and unfunny then that's when you've got yourself a problem.Wayne's World won't be for everyone and I suspect that those in the younger demographic will probably enjoy it more than the older demographic, but for me its self-awareness, the fact it doesn't take itself seriously and it's silly tone made it a hard film for me not to like.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

A true classic,"Penelope Spheeris ""Wayne's World"" is a true classic. I first saw this film around its release in 1992, and for me it's never aged, it a film I've grown up with, from the days where I didn't quite understand the grown up jokes but laughed anyway, to the last time I watched it a few weeks ago (and yes, I got the jokes this time...). The jokes are still as witty, the sheer stupidity but yet genius of the characters are fantastic. Garth will go down as greatest geek to grace the earth, with his amazing cow prodelling skills, but yet still possesses the power to make me laugh till I wanna ""spew"". This film seems to be a starting point for Mike Myers, a playground for him to develop the comedy style that will eventually lead to Austin Powers, and being a fan of all Myers work I have loved watching the progression to his latest release taking place. Being from England, although I am aware of Saturday Night Live and what it entails, I am unaware of how Wayne's World came across on the small screen, however from previous experience of television to film leaps I don't think this one has faired badly at all. As im sure you have probably gathered by now, I am a fan of this film, however I am aware that it doesn't appeal to all tastes, it is outlandish and absolutely ridiculous at times, but for me it all adds to the charm. I don't think this film ever set out to be taken seriously, or indeed to be hailed a master piece by critics, but for the simple purpose of creating a film that made people laugh, and I feel through its sheer naivety it has become one of the most hilarious and age-less classic for me.",,Anonymous,Music

Excellent!,"Back in the early 90's, Saturday Night Live was brought back to life with a great cast. Among them were Mike Myers and Dana Carvey who created some of the most memorable characters Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar. A bunch of Saturday Night Live movies were released, some were gigantic hits like Blues Brothers and some were misses Coneheads(which I loved by the way). Wayne's World was nothing on Saturday Night Live but two stoners who just ragged on things, how could you make it into a full feature length film? Not only did Penelope Spheeris do it, she knocked it out of the ball park with Wayne's World. It's one of the funniest movies that you could ever see with one of the most memorable scenes in comedy history making ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by Queen shoot back up to number one on the charts.Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar are the hosts of Wayne's World in Aurora, Illinois, where they ogle pictures of beautiful celebrity women, play air guitar and drums, and interview local people, indirectly making fun of them over. One day Benjamin, a television station executive, when he finds out how many people watch the show, he instructs his producer Russell Finley to find out where the show is taped, telling him they may have an opportunity for a huge sponsorship. Benjamin shows up next week in Wayne's basement and introduces himself after the show ends. He offers to buy the rights to the show and to keep Wayne and Garth on for what he describes as a ""huge"" salary. Little do they know that they are about to be sold out.The cast had this absolutely amazing chemistry that made this film work in all the right places adding new characters with Tia Carrere, Rob Lowe, and Kurt Fuller. I love this scene where Wayne and his girlfriend Cassandra go into a music store and he starts the riff on the guitar playing Led Zepplin's song ""Stairway to Heaven"" and the sales associate points to the sign that says ""No Stairway to Heaven"", thank you for that message! I love Wayne's reaction to it as well ""No Stairway? Denied!"", too funny. Also they meet Alice Cooper, who I met as a little girl, and he is one of the most intelligent people you could meet in real life and I loved how they captured it in this movie showing that Alice is a character, in real life he's incredibly intelligent, gentle and cool. He tells Wayne and Garth to hang with them and they just get down on their knees screaming ""We're not worthy!"" and he leans his hand out so they could kiss it! I nearly died laughing at the scene where the T2 pulls Wayne over showing him the picture of John Conner ""Have you seen this boy?"". I loved the multiple endings.

You expect solid acting from Myers and Carvey, and they deliver on their ""characters."" But that's it.These are not characters that any of them had to work on AKA method acting.There's no stretch here at all. In fact, I'm offended that they made a film of this, and expect anyone
to be impressed by the work. It's a TV-hack's hack.Maybe you don't mind actors who create mindless, lazy work, but I do.ENTERTAINMENT:

case it's Myers writing and starring in, ergo, why this film conveys complete self-absorption on his part. The

Solid comedy revolving around rock/metal,"""Wayne's World"" revolves around Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) who have a limited access public TV show shot in the basement of Wayne's mother's house. Wayne starts a relationship with a hot Asian rocker (Tia Carrere) while a smooth-talking TV producer tries to take advantage of them (Rob Lowe).The movie was released in 1992 when the 80's rock/metal culture was already fading due to the advent of grunge, but this can be excused on the grounds that the movie can be traced to a comedy sketch from 1987 when hair rock/metal ruled.The main actors are well cast, Tia is stunning while Garth is hideous and often annoying, but otherwise likable. The movie is dumb, but consistently amusing while only occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. The best parts include the ""we don't sell-out to sponsors"" sequence and the Scooby-Doo false ending, as well as the ""no Stairway"" joke.""Waynes World"" is a solid comedy, but you have to be in the mood for a goofy comedy rooted in 80's rock/metal culture. I prefer the sequel, which is so funny it makes you cry laughing.The film runs 94 minutes and was shot in Illinois, California and Arizona.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Stupid in the best way possible,"Wayne's World is stupid. But in a good way. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are brilliant as the two main characters, the idiotic metal- heads still living with their parents, acting like teenagers; with each character – Wayne and Garth – providing laughs ranging from the extreme close-up right at the start, to the product placement scene.In fact, I would say the two are geniuses as of their performances, and the writers are for providing them with such a hilarious script. The wider cast is important too, with many of them helping towards some more funny stuff; which is what this stupid film is all about – as the ridiculous plot further proves.Wayne's World is one of the funnier films I've seen, with a stupid plot, stupid characters and a couple of geniuses behind it all to make it stupid in the best way possible. Mike Myers should have won an Oscar for his performance here.If you haven't watched this, watch it now.So I give it: 85/100 (rounded to 9/10 IMDb).What stops it reaching 90 is the film doesn't provide laughs quite consistently enough to reach such a high score.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Sends us the right message regarding comedy!,"This comedy is definitely hilarious. I'll admit, it's a bit unconventional, but I think that's what makes it such a successful comedy. It remains in pure comical status from beginning to end. This is apparent in the choice of having three endings at the close of the movie. It seems that in doing this, the movie was almost reassuring me that I don't have to actually FEEL for any of the characters. I can just finish the movie thinking, ""Wow, this was funny,"" and nothing more. I actually liked knowing that for once it would be acceptable for me to just laugh at a movie without taking it seriously as so many people often do. I don't think comedies are always meant to make perfect sense, and laughter is always more important than the idea of everything fitting together in the end.I also love how this movie is made so that the audience gets to see what is going on from the beginning and we are allowed to know that Wayne and Garth are obviously being manipulated by their producer, but they don't completely realize it themselves.Also this movie shows us that two nerdy grunge guys can in fact get chicks and I guess that's a good thing, right?

Memorable!,"A comedy like 'Wayne's World' needs to be viewed with expectations. When I say expectations, I mean to expect an ample set of laughs, irrespective if they are even non-sense. Adapted from a sketch of the same name on NBC's Saturday Night Live, this Penelope Spheeris directed 1992 comedy, is truly a memorable watch!'Wayne's World' tells the story of two best friends, Wayne & Garth, who host Wayne's World, a local Friday late-night cable access program based in Aurora, Illinois, where they ogle pictures of beautiful celebrity women, play air guitar and drums, and interview local people, indirectly making fun of them over the course of the interview.Mike Myers has written the film passionately, and the jokes in the film, though sometimes loud, manage to make you laugh & hurl. It's 94 minutes long in running time, and it's quite entertaining all through. Penelope Spheeris's direction is good.Mike Myers is quite good as Wayne. But I believe, it's Dana Carvey who steals the show. As Garth, he sports a horrendous wig, plays his part effortlessly and makes you laugh at the very right places. Tia Carrere is passable, while Rob Lowe does his bit well. Late Chris Farley pitches in a terrific cameo.On the whole, Go and take a hike on Wayne & Garth's World! Thumbs Up!",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Two Friends Who Share the Same Interests in Life,"""Wayne Campbell"" (Mike Myers) and ""Garth Algar"" (Dana Carvey) are two friends who share the same interests in life and host their own public-access television show which typically involves great humor at the expense of a guest. Then one day an advertising agent by the name of ""Benjamin Oliver"" (Rob Lowe) convinces a local arcade owner named ""Noah Vanderhoff"" (Brian Doyle-Murray) to sponsor the show on local television. Although Wayne and Garth like the initial money offered by Benjamin they fail to fully grasp the details of the contract and soon realize that they have surrendered all artistic control to him. If that wasn't bad enough, Wayne also discovers that Benjamin is very interested in his new girlfriend ""Cassandra"" (Tia Carrere) as well--and he has no qualms about stealing her from him either. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had good portions of enjoyable humor throughout the entire course of the movie. Unfortunately, there were also some less successful pieces of humor here and there as well. Additionally, although this film was quite refreshing when it first came out, I don't believe it has aged very well and because of that I have adjusted the rating of this movie to reflect that fact.

It also shows how an easy idea can lead to one of the greatest movies ever made. It started with Wayne's Power Minute on Canadian television. After that Mike Myers used the same Wayne on Wayne's World as part of Saturday Night Live, the rest is history. The movie gives a great impression of how life as a teenager in the '90s was like. Very television and music based lifes who love to party and are trying to make ends meet. The movie has a nice plot with lots of other movie parodies next to it. Non stop comedy!

This film has to be the best Saturday Night Live based film, just barely beating Blues Brothers (1980), and beating A Night At The Roxbury (1998) by a long shot.

Few good moments,"I saw this movie on VHS during my adolescence. The information about its success in the US indicated that there were almost unlimited possibilities for enjoyment. This was not the case; the characters, completely unknown in Uruguay (SNL was not broadcast at that time) did not offer any support to follow their activities and to be able to identify with the story in any way. From that point of view, the film is a total impossibility since there is no way to have sympathy for anyone. If the heroes and villains are stupid, then the question arises: What is the point of the film? With only a couple of funny moments, experience indicates that there are several films that came out of SNL characters that have not achieved much in relation to box office impact precisely because their humor and absurdity are a little far from the palate of those accustomed to a school of comedians and humorists of a higher class and level.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

Likeable,"""Wayne's World"" is one of those movies that I should have watched a long time ago but for some reason didn't. I finally decided to catch up with it last night.It's a movie that's hard not to like, but perhaps harder to love. The characters are so likeable, and the whole thing so earnest, it has an undeniable, goofy charm.The plot is, really, too predictable. The love interest, the slick good looking guy after the hero's girl, the soulless rich guy who tries to corrupt the hero and spoil the youngsters' good time. It's like a '50s storyboard retrofitted with slacker '90s characters.What's interesting is that the heroes are, in all probability, potheads, but there's no mention of drugs.

A movie so tiring of jokes and one-liners isn't worthy!,"Mike Myers, with his comically canny dialogue and one-liners, fares much worse from WAYNE'S WORLD in my book. NOT! (he does, really) I would only recommend this for those who grew up watching the skits on S.N.L. a long time ago. View this all the way through for the first time, and you'll laugh, and you'll cry, and you'll hurl (as the tagline suggests). The funny jokes and gags are too weird enough to make you learn the entire script. Other than trying to understand Cantonese, ""babe"" Tia Carrere performs some rock tunes down to her lungs for your ""excellent"" pleasure. After that, it quickly becomes stale, and soon you'll forget it until another ten years pass by when you want to relive those precious memories. To me, this has never been my kind of movie to take seriously because it's downright obnoxious. For the benefit of some who have not had the chance to see it during high school, better give it a swing...er, I mean SCHWING! It'll be great fun.

"Party ON, but not to Part 2","Amazingly, 'Wayne's World' accomplished 2 huge feats: every joke's funny and it's the only SNL skit that actually works. (Note: every other 5 minute sketch stretched to 1.5 hours either falls flat or is mediocre, at best.) From the ""excellent"" cameos (Alice Cooper was downright hilarious) to the music segments that ""rock"" to the talk-to-the-camera and spoofs that produce some of the funniest moments, 'Wayne's World' really does work. Too many great quotes to reprint, I found myself saying out loud half the movie. It helped that, when in theaters (1992) I saw it 3x. I took a date who coincidentally was the same person I took to only my second concert: Alice Cooper. She didn't understand most of the humor, while I was rolling with laughter. Furthermore, I remember her wondering why Cooper talked the way he did backstage as opposed to on stage. If you don't follow that, or a lot of the inside jokes, this movie may not be for you. However, anyone who grew up in the 70s and 80s should very much appreciate the quality of jokes and references. I.E. 'Laverne & Shirley in Scooby Doo's Mystery of Noah's Ark.' Basic plot involves the late night cable access (long before internet) show 'Wayne's World' is being targeted to a wider audience by a suspicious Rob Lowe. Everything else is just 1 skit after another, that was actually original and consistent. The entire cast was great, including Carrere, Carvey, O'Neill and Boyle. The soundtrack was wonderful. Even the chemistry between Carrere/Myers rang true (and on the other side, the relationship between Myers and his ex also showed honesty.) The only thing that did not fare well was 'Wayne's World 2.'

"Too weird to be true, but Wayne and Garth rock ... and roll too ...","Once upon a time in Aurora (Illinois), in a modest basement :""Wayne's World! Wayne's World! Party On! Excellent!""""Extreme close up""""Waaaaaaah""Ahhh,.. ""Wayne's World"", as one of its several number-one fans, I have so many things to say that I really don't know how to handle it. Well, how about the mega-pompous over-insightfully wannabe Ebert approach, with a nostalgic and teary eye:THE MEGA-POMPOUS OVER-INSIGHTFULLY WANNABE-EBERT APPROACH, WITH A NOSTALGIC AND TEARY EYE:To assert my cinematic knowledge; I would say that ""Wayne's World"" is probably to the 90's what ""Car Wash"" was to the 70's, the comedic encapsulation of a spirit that today prevails  not, with Rock'n'Roll and Heavy Metal replacing Funk and Disco as the two musical pillars conveying the nostalgic feeling of the early 90's. ""Wayne's World"" is so dedicated to music, to the very spirit that made music indispensable in those excessive post-Berlin wall consumerist days, that not only it rocked on that level, but rolled, too.But more than a film about music, ""Wayne's World"" is the ode for a whole generation that grew up with 'Scooby Doo' and 'Sesame Street' and was still sucking the thumbs of the eighties at the dawn of the electronic era. Those were the times were the net was still synonym of fishing, and when Zuckerberg was still watching ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"". In a nutshell, ""Wayne's World"" is to Cinema what ""Smell Like Teen Spirit"" was to Rock.But I guess if Mike Myers was told that his film was the best that ever captured the spirit of the X-generation, he would modestly answer with a suave and solemn voice: ""I was not aware of that!"". Indeed, twenty years later, many viewers look at the film with a nostalgic eye and say 'hey, this is how it used to be' but that's only one (and probably unintentional) secondary level, in fact, when you watch ""Wayne's World"", it's a whole other dimension that cuts straight to you.THE EMOTIONAL INTROSPECTION INTO WAYNE AND GARTH'S INSPIRINGLY SELF-REFLEXIVE INTERACTION:Watching ""Wayne's World"" is an excellent antidote against bad mood, you're simply having a great time following the crazy adventures of Wayne Campbell, the host of a (feeble according to Benjamin) TV public-access cable show of the same name, with his sidekick and best friend Garth Algar. Mike Meyers (in his film debut) and Dana Carvey play one of the most recognizable duos of the 90's and probably the funnier and gentler, as nothing is more exhilarating than watching them making fun of their host, playing road-hockey, lying on the Mirthmobile waiting for planes to land, elaborating the most philosophical statements about girls, music and life, and last but not least, visiting Milwaukee.The film sets the tone very quickly when Wayne starts talking to the camera, the fourth-wall-breaking is one of the film's greatest delights as if it was aware of its own cleverness enough to push the self-derision button, making fun of its own ending, plot devices, and getting away with one of the most blatant cases of product placements... that actually worked and became an instant classic. The talking-to-the-camera is also a perfect invitation to join this group and its communicative funON THE QUOTABILITY 1-10 SCALE, THIS GOES TO ELEVENIt's irreverent but never vulgar, intelligent but not inaccessible, childish but not annoying, the humor displayed in ""Wayne's World"" shares the same goofiness than some Zucker or Brooks' parodies, but it defines something new, beyond the jokes and the inventive vocabulary how 'shall' I put it? Well, many lines can lead to cringe-worthy silences or awkward 'What the hell does that mean?' pauses but in ""Wayne's World"", for some reason, the weirdest lines work. Garth might sound a bit too one-dimensional but the way he delivers his ""Hi!"" and ""Thank you"" is a no-cringe guarantee, and don't even get me started on Mike Myers who can make people laugh with lines as stupid as ""Esquueze me? A baking powder?"" just as Jim Carrey can afford to play an obnoxious character like 'Ace Ventura' and keep it funny. When you got talent, you can get away with everything.The film features one classic or priceless line every 30 seconds and in fact, let me rewrite this chapter's title, it's :ON THE QUOTABILITY 1-10 SCALE, THIS GOES TO ELEVEN, ON THE MEMORABILITY, TO TWELVE !The great Howard Hawks said it himself: ""a good movie is three good scenes and zero bad scene"", then Wayne's World is a triumph on the field of comedic film-making. Penelope Spheeris directed one of the funniest American comedies, opening it with the emblematic 'Bohemian Rhapsody' lip-synching scene. And till now, whenever the instrumental part starts, I feel like frenetically banging my head.The film also includes a great cast, Rob Lowe as the antagonistic slick small TV exec and womanizer, and Tia ""Schwing!"" Cassandra, a beautiful Chinese singer. Good thing they avoided the obvious stereotype of a pretty blonde chick, and made her more exotic if only for the Cantonese quotes' gags, that lead to one of the most obscure and hilarious line when they order Cantonese food. The film features many great cameos, among them, a notable performance from Alice Cooper, Alice Cooper who'll help me to conclude this expose by paraphrasing one of the film's most brilliant exchanges :""In fact, is it ""Wayne's World"" one of the all-time funniest movies?""""Yes, Pete it is""(PS1: the film made it in Gene Siskel's Top 10 movies from 1992, so believe me, it IS worthy! it IS worthy!)(PS2: this review contains 10 superlatives and too many adverbs, it is so incredibly badly written)(PS3: have you noticed that the review's title is a haiku?)",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"A witty, high-brow comedy for the intelligent movie-goer...NOT!","But who says a movie has to be that smart for it to be funny?  Actually, for a ""stupid but fun"" comedy, it was also fairly intelligent, considering the brilliant parodies and the clever yet stupid jokes.I knew I missed out when I didn't see this movie back in '92, but seeing as how I was 8, I probably wouldn't have had as much fun.  Now that I'm approaching the ""party time"" of my life, I can appreciate the chemistry of Dana Carvey and Mike Myers.  They completely disappear into their respective characters and manage to carry the film well, as a pair of fairly stupid, yet extremely charming cable TV hosts.The jokes are often unpredictable.  You just never know who's going to get a cameo, or what's going to be made fun of next.  There's a LITTLE gross-out humor in this, but I've seen more than my fair share of gross-out comedies, and Wayne's World doesn't come close to being sick.  It's just plain funny. Many movie conventions are poked fun of, including gratuitous sex scenes, painfully obvious product placements, and melodramatic Oscar-worthy scenes. Alice Cooper makes a very memorable cameo as himself, waxing intellectual with Wayne and Garth while still in full shock-rock gear.Then there's the two stars themselves.  Wayne is certainly the more confident of the pair, but he's never overbearing.  Garth is adorable, as he is often extremely shy and keeps wanting to get together with a girl at the donut shop, but doesn't know how to approach her, leading to a hilarious Jimi Hendrix-inspired dream sequence.  The leads are endearing, though fortunatly, this film never tries to take itself seriously.  The ending sequenece is a perfect example, though I refuse to ruin the hilarity of Wayne's World's final scenes.I like my fair share of movies where I can turn off my brain and enjoy, but I also hate movies that are stupid to the point of insulting me.

"Basement-Dwellers at Play in This Classic, Somewhat Dated, SNL Headliner","SNL's first spinoff since The Blues Brothers, a dozen years earlier, is very much a product of its time. It's a loving snapshot of the end of an era; a time when a roving car full of scruffy-looking dudes could stumble upon a partied-out buddy, stuff him in the back seat and revive him through the power of prog rock and timely, enthusiastic headbanging.Mike Myers and Dana Carvey, still so fresh-faced that they were expected back in Studio 8H after a mere forty days of filming, clearly live for their roles. As twin emcees, they're the joyful, easygoing masters of an itty bitty sphere of influence, but quickly turn wide-eyed and innocent when a suave corporate opportunist (Rob Lowe, in a perfectly-cast turn) comes knocking with a TV deal. That whole plot is as telegraphed as they come, an unmistakably simple blueprint, and the cast isn't above cracking a few meta jokes at its expense.Really, we aren't here for the story anyway. It's all about the gags, quotes, skits and one-liners, which are scattered abundantly throughout. A continuous playground in that respect, fertile grounds for a hungry crew looking to stretch their wings. I've referenced this movie, exhaustively, for almost thirty years now. And, while all the old familiar bits still draw a big reaction, this is the first time I've noticed how culturally dated they're beginning to feel. In that sense, too, it's forever stuck in the early '90s.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"If This Film Was Breakfast, It Would Be Ham And Excellent!","Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) broadcasts a cable access show called Wayne's World from his parents' basement, along with his best friend Garth Algar (Dana Carvey). Although they have little going for them except the show, we won't call them losers. They are slackers, because they are generally happy with their lives. Mike is like the typical class clown. Garth is socially awkward.The film is a slice of life comedy, a (SNL) skit-to-flick adaptation directed by Penelope Spheeris. I don't want to mention the scenes or comedy bits--some now iconic--throughout the film. But Myers and Carvey are comedic geniuses and they get to display their talents in various ways.Tia Carrere plays Cassandra, the object of Wayne's desires. As lead singer for a rock group, she shows off her great voice. Who knew?Other actors included to good effect are Rob Lowe and Lara Flynn Boyle. I also enjoyed the appearances of Colleen Camp, Brian Doyle-Murray, Donna Dixon, Chris Farley, Meat Loaf, Robert Patrick, and Ed O'Neill.This might be considered low brow humor, but many of the jokes are rather erudite.

"I learned how to spell a certain body part by watching this movie...and I still remember the ad shown before ""The Addams Family""","As Mike Myers is now best known as Austin Powers, it's easy to forget that he started out as Aurora, Illinois, goof-ball Wayne Campbell. ""Wayne's World"" is just as funny today as it was back in 1992. I'd never seen the ""Saturday Night Live"" skit before the movie came out, but that didn't hurt anything; the movie is a hoot whether or not you've seen the ""SNL"" skit.As for the other characters, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) is my favorite. How he comes up with some of those things I'll never know. Maybe Cassandra (Tia Carrere) and Benjamin (Rob Lowe) weren't totally necessary, but even they had their moments. But the best scene is definitely when they're filming and Wayne is reading the questions off of the cards; it's quite possible that you'll die laughing when that scene comes up.But the point is, this flick is a modern comedy classic. I still remember how everyone in school went around saying ""Not!"" after it came out.

The ""Grey Poupon"" reference, for example, is probably foreign to younger viewers.That being said, it is still fun, with Rob Lowe playing a decent villain (even if he looks very out of place).

Tube to screen transfer is tiresome,"My review was written in February 1992 after a Times Square screening.""Wayne's World"" weakly transfers the popular ""Saturday Night Live"" TV sketch to the big screen. Aggressively pitched at a young white male audience, feature is unlikely to appeal to mainstream moviegoers.SNL regular Mike Myers created the characters of two overage heavy metal teens fronting a cable access TV show in Aurora, Illinois. Like Weird Al Yankovic's flop Orion pic ""UHF"", the film satirizes various genres using TV as a starting point.Playing an Art Garfunkel sidekick to Myers' Paul Simon, SNL mate Daa Carvey bounces back after his bland first film vehicle ""Opportunity Knocks"". Thin script by Myers and TV writing cronies Bonnie & Terry Turner is simply a skeleton for applying music and gags, all delivered in a knowing, winking at the audience fashion (with frequent asides directly to the camera).Ostensible plot has Rob Lowe as a slimy opportunist who buys the heroes' ""Wayne's World"" show and re-structures it to plug Brian Doyle-Murray's video arcade business. Wayne (Myers) falls in love with beautiful Hong Kong rock singer tia Carrere and has to worry about womanizer Lower stealing her away.Director Penelope Spheeris, with her first major studio assignment (and eight-figure budget), delivers a colorful but uneventful picture. Far too much footage is devoted to Carrere's indifferent singing, the heroes' comical lip-synching or pointless filler like a visit to an Alice Cooper concert. Even for fans of the TV comics, the laugh-to-running-time ratio is extremely low.Silliness includes a spoof of product plugs (that serves as an extended product plug and typical cross-references to other Paramount properties like ""Star Trek"" and ""Laverne & Shirley"". As with Paramount's ill-fated ""Clue"" film, the picture features three alternate endings, played back to back like the ""Clue"" video.Myers, funny in small doses on the tube, overstays his welcome as the grinning, know-it-all Wayne while Carvey is childishly endearing as the nerdy Garth. Lowe smirks his way through a non-role, Carrfere's beauty is featured in a variety of sexy outfits and Lara Flynn Boyle handles the slapstick.Guest stars add almost nothing to the proceedings, including Dan Aykryoyd's wife Donna Dixon as Carvey's beautiful dream girl, Ione Skye as Lowe's girlfriend, Meat Loaf as a bouncer and Ed O'Neill as a nutty donut shop manager.",,Anonymous,Music

It Certainly Does Suck...,"Like every SNL skit transformed into a feature film, this just doesn't work. I've grown to loathe Mike Myers. His SNL days were the only time I ever liked him. Likewise, Dana Carvey was only ever built for sketch comedy. Despite being the more diverse of the two, this was one of his lesser characters. Predictably, this movie just recycles gags that were punchlines from the sketch and not much else. This concept forces them to fill in the gaps with long sequences that don't do anything, like the Bohemian Rhapsody car ride. That scene is iconic but if you examine it closely, it doesn't further the plot or actually do anything for the movie. It really is a metaphor for the entire film. I also wonder if Rob Lowe was contractually obligated to play a villain in all of Lorne Michaels' productions. This movie is really just a lot of random gags wrapped around a thin plot with an excellent soundtrack, and I'd be willing to bet that the soundtrack sold more copies than the movie. Bottom line, I loved it when I was young but it doesn't stand the test of time.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Mike Meyers plays the most excellent host of a cable access show. Dana Carvey is quirky nerd, uncomfortable in front of a camera, but dedicated to the show. Tia Carrere plays the total babe Cassandra, lead singer of Crucial Taunt, and the love of Wayne's life. Rounding out the cast is Rob Lowe, the shifty babe magnet with a perfect profile and no visible scars.The cameos are notable as well, Alice Cooper being the most memorable. Chris Farley is not to be forgotten as the security guard that knows more then can be reasonably assumed. And Ed ""Al Bundy"" O'Neil as a creepy diner operator.

And, ""We fear change."", this movie is classic from beginning to end.  I saw it for the first time in years a year ago, and I feared that it couldn't possibly be as good as I remembered it; it was so juvenile, so purile.  But when I saw it again, it was even better.  I now try to watch it at least once every few months so I can remember how good it really is. (Asfinktersezwut? What? Exactly.)Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are comic genii, plain and simple. Tia Carrere is cute and sassy as Cassandra (and I mean that in the most non-demeaning and infantile way possible), Rob Lowe was just spiffy as the evil Benjamin, and hey, who can say no to a Scooby Doo Ending?Full of great tunes, fine comedy, and cameos and stars out the wazoo, Wayne's World is the quintessential comedy for the slacker burnout metalhead in us all.  It also works for grownups. *grin*",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"2 Party time guys try to get there show on t.v. there are many funny things that happen along the way, They also meet many bad things, but everything evens out at the final ending.","This is definatlly the best movie I 've ever seen in my entier life.  Mind you though, I'm only 13.  Any way, this movie deserves more than a 10, but because that's as high as it goes, I' had to give it a ten.  This movie is hillarious!  IT doesn't have stupid humor either.  Everything is very funny and laid out very well. I am in love with this movie and the casting is perfect.  I am in love with Garth Algar.

One of my favorite movies.,"Wayne's World has to be one of my favorite movies. It is the ultimate party movie, the ultimate quotable movie, and If you don't like it you can't be one of my friends.  The acting is what you'd expect but when you watch it you aren't supposed to look at the acting.  The humor never gets old, and I think this is the only time a Saturday night live sketch was as good as/better on screen as on TV.  I also think that movie makers could learn a lot from this movie when they are trying to think of ways to reach out to the teen generation, simply because this movie is so priceless. It's dumb but it's always playing at parties that I've been too!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A hilarious comedy classic of the 1990's!,"Wayne's WorldStarring: Mike Myers, Dana Carvey, Rob Lowe, Brian Doyle-Murray, Lara Flynn Boyle, Chris Farley (brief appearance) and special guest appearance by Alice CooperRated: PG-13Genre: ComedyStar Rating: ***** out of 5Wayne's World is one of the funniest comedy movie classics of the 1990's! It is about these two guys named Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) have their own TV-show called Wayne's World. They film the TV-show in Wayne's basement but when someone wants to own the rights of the TV-show. The show becomes a big smash hit! One of the most funniest parts in Wayne's World is when they were discussing the contract with one of the guys and Wayne does hear what he said so Wayne said ""Ex-squeeze me? Baking Powder?"". Also in the movie this one guy named Ben Oliver who is a sleazy advertising guy tries to kill the show off the air. But fails of course! I thought Mike Myers and Dana Carvey made a pretty good comedy team in this one and in Wayne's World 2!BOTTOM LINE: VERY FUNNY!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Waynes World! Party Time! Excellent!,"Ok, when I bought this for my little brother for xmas 2000, I said I would watch it with him, xpecting it to be a crap comedy. I've watched it three times since then! I guess what I'm trying to say is that this movie is really good. From the first minute to the last, you will be laughing along and feeling like you know the characters well. Memorable scenes will stay in your head such as Wayne and Garth on top of a car at the end of a runway watching planes fly feet above their heads, daring each other to 'KEEP LOOKING UP!' Garths brilliant strut to the song 'Foxy' will have you laughing, along with Wayne's learning of 'Cantonesse', in which they are subtitled, and sometimes have to wait for a few minutes before the words catch up with what they are saying. Overall, this is one of the best comedy films I've seen! 9/10  or  4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Decline of Western Civilization Part 2.5: The Party On Years,"Wayne and Gath (Mike Myers and Dana Carvey respectively) make the jump from Saturerday Night Live recurring skit to do my third favorite SNL-based film (the two ahead of it are ""Office Space"" and ""the Blues Brothers). In this hilarious film, Wayne and Garth are doing their lowly public access show, when they're discovered by Ben Kane (Rob Lowe of ""the Outsiders"" and ""St. Elmos Fire), who proceeds to get them to sign a contract to take there small show and produce a national version of it. Wayne uses the deal to get his new love interest, Cassandra Wong (Tia Carrere, who now seemed to fall into oblivion. This is a warning to all aspiring actresses to NEVER say no to nude scenes or fall by the wayside) and her band to play on his show. But Ben isn't as benevolent as he first seems to be. With non-stop humor, as well as great memorable cameos by Ed O'Neill, Meatloaf, Chris Farley, and the amazingly great Alice Cooper, what's NOT to love?? Plus ANY time Brian Doyle-Murray gets to be in a film is greatness. Oh and be sure to stay through the credits.My Grade: ADVD Extras: Commentary by Director Penelope Spheeris; 23 minutes,15 seconds of cast and crew interviews; Clips from ""the Brady Bunch"", ""Solid Gold Workout"" & 1979's ""Sundown"";and Theatrical TrailerDVD Gripes: Led Zeppelin suck ass for screwing up a part of this classic movie, they can shove ""Stairway to Heaven"" up you know what.

LIVE IN THE NOW!,"This film is an absolute classic! I can't believe that its got a small average, it should be at least 7.6 or in my view 10.0!!! The lines are absolutly 'excellent' or 'sang!'. Like a classic one ""asphinctersayswhat"" or ""If Benjamin were an ice cream flavor, he'd be pralines and dick."".Myers and Carvey are brilliant and very funny, from the ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" scene to the guitar seen ""it will be mine, oh yes, it will be mine"" with Garth answering ""you'll never afford it! LIVE IN THE NOW!"".I could quote all day here but there is a quotes page ""exsqueeze me? a baking powder?"" yes there is! This site is cool by the way!Anway back to the film, Tia Carrere is brilliant and SeXy ""swinggg"", plus Rob Lowe is great as the high flyer Benjamin. The cameos from Alice Cooper, Chris Farley (R.I.P), Meat Loaf, Robert Patrick (in a very very funny T2 skit)and of course the very weird but funny Ed O'Neil ""I'd never done a crazy thing in my life before that night. Why is it that if a man kills another man in battle it's called heroic, yet if he kills a man in the heat of passion it's called murder.""! Classic!But of course the MAJOR stars are Mike Myers and Dana Carvey and you can see why this film was a hit and why the sequel is a good film for a sequel. I would love to see a Wayne's World 3 but Ive been wanting that for nearly 9 years now! i dont think it will happen. Many people say Myers is funnier in Austin Powers ""Way"" but hes not, this is fresh and great with great wit and great lines, with a great story which Austin 2 did lack.Finally i would like to end with my favorite Wayne quotes ""cha! and monkey's will fly out of my butt"", and after receiving his gun-rack from his 'girlfriend' Stacy ""I don't even own *a* gun, let alone many guns that would necessitate an entire rack. What am I gonna do with a gun rack?... (which is followed by)... ""We broke up! Are you mental?""

One of the most hilarious movie ever,"If you like comedies, this movie is a must see. The humor might not appeal to everybody, but who cares. I think it's brilliant.

One of those movies you can watch again and again and they will never become boring.   9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Music
IMDBrandon: Penelope Spheeris,"Wayne's World is the best representation of an SNL sketch-turned-movie, and a staple of 90s comedy. In rewatching this time around, I wanted to focus in on the influence of director Penelope Spheeris. Though Mike Myers and Lorne Michaels are typically given the respect and credit for the success, so much of that success is a tribute to Spheeris' vision and ability to stand up for that vision. Standing up to Myers and Michaels would cost her Wayne's World 2, but I don't know that the sequel would've grossed as much had it not been for the scenes she fought for. With that said, the comedic personas of Wayne and Garth, mixed with the addition of so many characters who get their moments to shine, makes for a highly entertaining, hilarious watch that I can find new things to appreciate with every rewatch. This time was Ed O'Neill (who gets the and Ed O'Neill credit), who made so much out of so little. Wayne's World is fairly rated on IMDb with 7.0/10, though this was a film getting made off SNL clout rather than it's overly capable woman director. You can now stream it on Prime Video.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

One of the funniest things in the film is 'Garths' insecurity, The Music and Waynes love of his guitar and the complete sense of companionship throughout the entire film make a wonderful experience well worth it the £5.99 that you can buy it for at supermarkets.I think that this is better than Wayne's world 2, but Wayne's world 2 is still a classic and worth seeing",10.0,Anonymous,Music
best movie in the entire world!!!,Wayne's world has been with me since i was 2 and i still laugh at Wayne and Garth's great little adventure on this movie and also i could probably recite the whole movie from memory and by this movie i think i learned a little bit of a different language.. it is also a great comedy for anyone to watch with all of the randomness and such and also it is Mike Myer's and Dana Carvey as Wayne and Garth! couldn't get better than that. and Chris Farley's appearance is also a great little part even though he is in there for a short time i don't think any other fat actor could pay a fat security guard like he did! also the music in the movie is great i just wish i could have the soundtrack,10.0,Anonymous,Music
A comedy for the ages.,"Waynes world is an excellent Movie experience for any fan of the comedy genre. It's a fun filled experienced unmissable for comedy fans like myself, it gets all the good things about comedy and mixes it together with romance, action and music seamlessly blended together in a brilliant concoction of cinematography.The camera and voice acting are probably what I like most about Waynes world as they really convey Wayne and Garth's dilemma.What really doesn't do it for me is some of the plot and actors. They keep trying to parody things, which doesn't work to well and sometimes the plot goes off on tangents.(I watched the DVD version.)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
My Favorite Film Ever!,"I use to watch Wayne's World and it's sequel every couple of years in the late 90's to early 00's as I thought they were hilarious. Well, I haven't seen them for about 10 years or more now so picked up a Blu-ray copy ready to sit down and laugh out loud... While I did laugh, it wasn't as hard as I once may have. It's still funny and the lines are quotable but some jokes just felt immature and dumb rather than unique and smart. The pop culture references are getting pretty dated these days, I know some of the younger folks out there won't get them, but I still did and the references were what got the biggest laughs out of me. There is a story and it ties the jokes together well I guess and there's a number of cameos which are still cool to this day like, Alice Cooper, but my personal favorite was, Robert Patrick, resuming his role as the T-1000 in homage to Terminator 2, my favorite film ever!Final Verdict: Comedy films are always hard to rate, you either laugh or your don't. And if you laugh, it's done it's job. Yes this is still funny, but much like me it's getting old and some of the jokes or what I thought was ""smart"" off-the-wall comedy when younger just feels flat and silly. The pop culture references, music and cameos are the main attraction to me now and to that effect, it still works to this day. Recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"What a totally amazing, excellent movie.. YES!!","What a masterpiece. There aren't too many bad jokes in this movie.. actually I can't think of a single one. The Bohemian Rhapsody opening is such a classic. Pure fun at it's best. There's such an amazing chemistry between the whole cast that it spills on the screen. Party. And I love the cameos by Alice Cooper and Robert Patrick. This movie dates back at a time when Carvey still had a career. The Master of Disguise is clearly an attempt to create a franchise for him, because Myers has Austin Powers. You be the judge of how well that turned out. In this movie anyway, Carvey is good. Excellent. Lowe also brings color to his sleezy character. It gives me barrels of laughs the watch this movie, because it doesn't feel fake and it's v e r y clear that they had a great time making it. And when ordering Chinese take-out, I recommend the cream of sum yung guy.***** / *****",10.0,Anonymous,Music
great movie,I think that this is one of the best movies that has sprung from SNL. Mike Meyers and Dana Carvery are hilarious throughout. If you have yet to see this movie go and check it out. I live on the south side of Chicago and can tell you that it is very well portrayed in the film. Also after you see this movie you will never listen to Bohemian Rhapsody the same way again. The movie is basically about these two guys who have a cable access TV show and they are trying to get it on a real network. The movie is just hilarious and that is it. If you like either Mike or Dana or both then you will like this movie.It is great. So go ahead and laugh you butt of to this one eight out of ten stars.,8.0,Anonymous,Music

Myers and Carvey are gnarly dude,"The first time I saw this one was when I got it as a gift from my parents when it was on sale at McDonalds.  I was relatively young and wanted it because my friends said to get it.  So basically, I hated it on the first viewing and hadn't watched it for a long time.  Recently, I saw the best of Mike Myers on SNL (who I now knew from Austin Powers).  There were clips of Wayne's World, which marks the very first time I've seen that skit on SNL. Also, about a month ago, I saw the sequel on USA.  OK, I can understand it now, so I decided to dig the original out of the box in my closet and watch it again.  It is now what I consider to be one of the best comedies ever. Myers and Carvey are perfect, the one-liners are awesome, and the Scooby-Doo ending is classic.

Hilarious and cool,"Hilarious and cool.Wayne (played by Mike Myers) and his friend Garth (Dana Carvey) have their own program on public access television, broadcast from the basement of Wayne's parents' house. It is pretty low-key and has a limited audience. However, they are spotted by an unscrupulous, superficial and manipulative TV producer, Benjamin (Rob Lowe), who aims to turn them more mainstream and exploit the advertising and sponsorship potential of the showBased on the characters Mike Myers and Dana Carvey played on Saturday Night Live, Wayne's World is very funny and original. Some great dialogue and one-liners and contemporary (for the early/mid- 90s) humour. Some fairly clever send-ups of popular culture too. Captures well the zeitgeist of the early/mid-90s, including the music – the soundtrack is excellent.Only downside is that it hasn't aged too well, and the in-humour of the mid-90s doesn't transfer very well to 20+ years later. It did feel a bit less fresh in 2016 as opposed to 1992. Still a great movie though.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
My favorite movie (second only to Waynes World 2),"This is such a funny, clever movie. Its a classic. I recommend everyone watch it. Wayne and Garth are two very lovable characters that portray rock metal-heads without taking the airhead act to far. There are some great lines: ""Exsqueeze me? A baking powder?"" ""We're not worthy! We're not worthy!"" ""It's sucking my will to live!!"" ""I'll have the ""cream of sum yung guy"" ""Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?"" and plenty more that I cant think of right now.Wonderful music mainly from early 1990s when this movie was set.I think it stands the test of time better than a lot of other movies from that era, my 12 year old cousins watched it a few weeks ago and enjoyed it. Probably more suited for grown ups, but in saying that its not an adult movie, its just a lot funnier when you can get all the jokes. I appreciate it a lot more now that I'm older.It would pay to watch Waynes World 2 if you like this movie, it is better than the original. But watch this one first!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Not what it seems.,"Let me come out and confess: I thought this movie was hilarious.  I know it looks dumb, I know it looks like Beavis and Butthead minus the music videos.  It's much more than that.  You see, Wayne's World is one of the few comedies that get better with every viewing.  Facial expressions and one-liners you didn't catch pop up.  One of the greatest aspects of Wayne's World, however, is that the laughs don't stop when the movie does.  If you see it with friends (and you should, believe me), it opens up a whole new world of inside jokes and references to be had.  Do yourself a favor and rent it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Kewl! :o),"Wayne's World is a classic! It went straight over my head the first time i saw it, because i wasn't really paying attention. Oh sure, i laughed at the time...it was still funny...but i didn't appreciate its true glory! The more i see this film, the more subtle jokes, delightful obscurity, and wonderfully inane references to popular culture seem to spring out at me. And much to its credit, not only does it feed on the 'pop-culture' of the social drop-out (60s sci-fi, heavy metal, and obscure british comedy), but it has managed, in return, to insinuate itself into popular culture throughout the world. I love it!!! Just take that scene in the music store... 'i like to play'....how can 4 words be so hilarious....and why did i suddenly think of that scene when i saw lars ulrich step out from behind his drumkit at a metallica concert, wearing geeky shorts and a T-shirt...to say 'i guess that's about that' Damn...its so difficult to explain why this film rocks....but it does. i guess you'd best just go watch it!!!

Dana Carvey and Mike Do an excellent job in their roles and really make a movie worth seeing.Despite the sometimes over the top style of humor, with the incredibly long subtitles when Wayne and Casandra are speaking another language. It is a very similar style to that of Mike's other more well known works, The Austin Powers series.This movie is a very light movie to watch and cause not hard laughs but a bunch of giggles and puts you into a happy mood. This is a good movie for a rainy depressing day and the soundtrack won me over because the music they play is a solid choice.So its Wayne's World! Party Time! Excellent!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
My 3rd Favourite Comedy Ever!,"Wayne's World is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen (my third favourite comedy) and is also one of my favourite movies. I have this movie on DVD and the special features just make it even better. My friend and I constantly quote this movie!Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are excellent as Wayne and Garth who have a public access TV show, who are offered to make it a primetime hit with the help of shady TV executive Benjamin (Rob Lowe). All the jokes in this are really funny, especially the scene about selling out (one of the funniest scenes in all the movies I've seen).It also shows one of Lara Flynn Boyle's earlier roles as Wayne's ex-girlfriend. If you can see this movie, DO IT!!!!Rating: 5/5!!!",,Anonymous,Music
Lovably Childish But Languid !,"The second in list of movies were based on ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches, and not one of their best, since I don't think that there was a movie that outclassed their first movie (The Blues Brothers - 1980) yet.Of course forget about any plot, drama, or even action. It's a chain of separate jokes, not real sketches, created by (Mike Myers) in not one of his finest days, noticing that it was his first as a screenwriter, so as a lead actor. The best ""joke"" was the sequence of ""we don't make commercials, or do anything for money!"". But unfortunately the rest is too sluggish, so the movie's pace is slow. And don't wait for witty parody, or real guest stars. For instance, (Robert Patrick) reprised his role as the evil Terminator swiftly and tastelessly!Overall, the whole thing looked really average or lower, comparing to (Myers)'s next movies or not. The performance is as weak as you can get. (Ed O'Neill) is unbearable as usual with so unfunny lines. (Rob Lowe) delivers feebly and frigidly, not trying to be even slightly droll. The survivors could be (Myers) with few of his own spontaneous moments (Camera 1, Camera 2!), and (Tia Carrere)'s performance.There is restful feel and innocent spirit all over it (the tripartite endings a la' Scooby-Doo style). At least it didn't resort to be the easy filthy comedy, with tons of dirty sexual material, or bad taste stuff, the way (Myers) himself would do badly 10 years later in (Austin Powers in Goldmember). It's not bad, it's short fun, lovably childish but languid. Anyhow, (Mike Myers) had to have a point to start from anyway. It's so clear that he wasn't aware of the movies' capacities well at the time.Finally, how this one succeeded superbly, grossing over 100 million dollar (!) to an extent that made a sequel--is such beyond me. It proved that (Myers) had certain something that the people loved, and it gives me hope that well meaning work with simple efforts can work big time.. Sometimes.",,Anonymous,Music
Excellent!,"Wayne's World is a brilliant, hilarious film. The highlight is Garth's dance along to Foxey Lady by Jimi Hendrix. Also, the film has a very good soundtrack, and some hilarious moments. All in all, I'd recommend you see it! Garth is just a character you have to love, because of his shyness and humour. Also, Crucial Tuant's redition of 'Fire' by Jimi Hendrix is great, and if you're a Jimi fan, I'd recommend this film! It has some jokes and scenes in it, that no matter how many times you watch the film, they crack you up every time. Plus the ending is funny! (Well actually there are three....)I haven't seen the second one yet, but I'm planning to soon! Excellent!",,Anonymous,Music
"Wayne's World!, Wayne's World!, It's party time!, excellent!...",This is Mike Myers best ever film next to W'sW2 and the 3 AP films. The characters are brilliantly written not to mention some of the best humour I've have ever seen in a motion picture.Favourite bit: When Wayne and Garth are in the TV studio and they are advertising various products just after Wayne says that their show will not have any sponsors.Best Song: The extended version of the Wayne's World themeConclusion: A brilliant movie. Rent or Buy it now. It's even on SKY so WATCH IT!10/10,,Anonymous,Music
BEST COMEDY EVER !,"I love this movie, is a big comedy , probably the best , you will have a lot of fun watching Wayne and Garth , these dudes are really funny,  the movie had a sequel as good as the first one,and I hope to see someday ""Wayne's World 3"".",,Anonymous,Music
party like it's 1980,This movie was a laugh after a laugh. It never stops being funny. Mike Myers and Dana Carvy. Wayne and Garth. It is about Wayne and Garth two best friends that have they're own T.V. show. But later another crew wants to take it over so they do. and the show changes a lot. so Wayne leaves because his show really changes and wayne doesn't get to play his guitar or anything. Other things happen but I can't tell otherwise it would give the movie away. It is really great. parties like it's 1980. I reccomend seeing this as soon as you can.,,Anonymous,Music
Wayne's World=Awesome Movie!,"""Wayne's World"" is probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's one of those movies where you either get it or you don't. Some of my friends hate it and others love it. I like it so much b/c some of the things Wayne and Garth laugh about and say are some things that I could see myself doing and laughing about. I think it's completely genuis.It has so many classic lines. I've seen it many times, and every time I watch it I catch something new. Fav parts are: Scooby-Doo ending, when they meet Alice Cooper, when they order chinese and say I want the cream of some young guy (lmao!), the advertisements for doritos, pepsi, pizza hut...aww hell...every single part rocks. I can't pick out my favs.",,Anonymous,Music
PARTY TIME! EXCELLENT!,"Although not nearly as funny now as it was when it was first released in 1992, WAYNE'S WORLD is a definite classic and is one of the funniest movies of the 1990's. The comedic performances by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are brilliant. Dana Carvery is one of the wittiest stand-up comedians ever, and that is shown in his ad-lib in the scene when they are on top of the car watching the airplane overhead, which is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. WAYNE'S WORLD is a party-hard movie filled with memorable lines. It may not be the best movie based on a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch (that would be THE LADIES MAN), but it still is one of the better comedies to come out in the past fifteen years. ***",,Anonymous,Music
Party on Garth ! Party on Wayne !,Wayne's World ! Wayne's World ! Party time ! Excellent !This very funny movie that makes us laugh all the time is about party (betwen Wayne and Garth) and love (between Wayne and Casandra) ! I think the first is better than the second . If you want to laugh see Wayne's World !,,Anonymous,Music
"Man oh man, wasn't this a snooze.","I'm sure there are many here who are filled with glee at the prospect of seeing a movie based on a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit featuring injection with Queen's classic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".I'm not one of them. For one thing, I have had it up to =HERE= with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". It was funny the very first time I heard it (back when it was brand new), and proceeded to be funny the next few GAZILLION times I've had it piped into my ears from various situations around me, but I simply don't laugh at it any more--it annoys me. Plus, ""Saturday Night Live"" is a show that, in my opinion, should be called ""The Show-Nobody-Thinks-Is-Funny Show"" (as ""TV Guide"" suggested back when this movie was released).First of all, the skit always struck me as a lame ""Bill and Ted"" ripp-off. And I didn't see this movie until a friend invited me over in 1993 and showed it to me. Oh well, at least I didn't have to pay to see it if nothing else.And maaaaaan, was this movie ever a snooze. It was easily the most unfunny movie I have seen in years to the point of nearly (and I mean literally) putting me to sleep.Snore.Out of the whole bit, there was only one quick routine that genuinely made me laugh: a scene which involved a girl suddenly stepping on to the screen while announcing in an exaggerated tone, ""Hi, Wayne! I'm pregnant! That's why I've been so moody!""Other than that... well, hey, what can I say? The ""Bill and Ted"" movies, both of which I avoided in the theatres out of fear of them being this bad but both loved by me when I later saw them on home video, knock this one black and blue. Or let me put it another way: ""Wayne's World"" is the sort of film that I was originally afraid the ""Bill and Ted"" movies would be but weren't.Go for ""Bill and Ted""! Heck, I still see a lot of enthusiasm for them these days and lots of jokes inspired by them in today's pop culture... in sharp contrast, who pays attention to ""Wayne's World"" anymore?And no, I will NOT make any sort of attempt at watching ""Wayne's World 2"". Not on your life.",,Anonymous,Music
I'm mental over this movie.,"""Wayne's World"" is just one awesome movie, especially when you see it with your friends. This has to be one of Mike Myers best movies ever it is absolutely hilarious and filled with great scenes like when they are listening to Queen's ""Bohemian Rhaspody"" in the ""Mirth Mobile"" or even the Scooby-Doo Ending my most favorite scene though is the one with Brian Doyle Murray(Bill's brother)as the Arcade mogul on the re-newed ""Wayne's World"" you'll know what I mean when you see the movie. Everything about this movie shines and the comic timing is just perfect.",,Anonymous,Music
If You're Gonna Spew...,"Now that I have you're attention!  Out of all the ""SNL"" movies, only a few have passed the test on the big screen.  I know that some people will argue with me on this point, but I'll give you an idea of some real stinkers...""It's Pat""- The three minute sketch that drove you nuts turned into a 90 minute movie.  UGH! ""The Coneheads""- The sketch wasn't that funny!  Really, it wasn't. ""Stuart Saves His Family""- Was I the only one who thought this was a waste of film and popcorn?Plus, I'm not even going to mention all the horrible movies that the stars of SNL have been part of...okay maybe just one...""Little Nicky"".Anyway, ""Wayne's World"" is one of the rare movies that actually worked as a full-length feature movie.Maybe it's due to the fact that I actually have friends like Wayne & Garth, or maybe it's because Mike Myers is a genius, but I think this movie is fabulous.Yes, it's over-quoted...well I should say, it was over-quoted.  You don't really hear guys saying ""As if"" or ""Schwing"" anymore...except my friends that I mentioned before, but it is just too funny watching these two guys being two guys.  Plus all the references to other movies and TV shows are wonderful.Let us not forget...ALICE COOPER!!!!!!!If you've never experienced ""Wayne's World"", check it out.  You never know, it could be the best movie that you've ever seen.  Yeah, right!  And monkeys might fly out of...",,Anonymous,Music
"I'm not much of a partier, but if YOU are, here's your film.","Metropolitan Chicago is turned into a wild party scene in the king of the early 90's slacker films, and one of the pioneers of the teen movie onslaught.Saturday Night Live duo Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are untouchable in their roles as wild partiers, with some music and entertainment in the mix.Look for great cameos by MeatLoaf, Ed O' Neill, and Tia Carrere's best role in her career.  Unfortunately, you'll have to bear Rob Lowe as his old, tired, patented snobby self, a mix of his we are tired of seeing.  What lasts longest in this movie are the memorable quotes and scenes that have always endured......those quotes being along the lines of ""schhwing!!"" ""Party time, excellent, and ""a sphincktersayswhat..."" If you've outgrown these quotes, we all have certainly not outgrown the famous car maching scene with ""Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody.""In fact, on that note, this movie was released right after the lead singer of Queen's untimely death from AIDS (Freddie Mercury).  Queens success in America was increased immeasurably, and it wasn't because of Mercury's death....it was because of the success of the movie!In all, this memorable comedy is good for a fun Friday night, but more for friends than for family.  Right on.My rating out of 10:   8.5",,Anonymous,Music
wayne's world isn't bad,"wayne's world isn't a bad movie,but it still doesn't have a whole lot of laughs. the two lead characters wayne,and garth are still fun to watch even if they aren't that funny. this movie moves at a nice pace so you won't get bored. all in all the characters make the movie fun,even if it doesn't have a lot of laughs. i give wayne's world **1/2 out of ****",,Anonymous,Music
Hilarious!,"Mike Myers is hilarious, as usual. He gives another terrific performance as a Surfer Dude-type guy who has his own TV show. Very funny through every scene.

Wayne's World: A Classic to America's Youth,"WAYNE'S WORLD has evolved to classic status among the youth of America. Wayne (MIKE MYERS) and Garth (DANA CARVEY) are the heroes that carry this film to greatness. WAYNE'S WORLD is a film that will always be remembered. If one was to make a time capsule in the early 1990s, WAYNE's WORLD would most definitely be included. The style, music, and expressions of WAYNE'S WORLD represent the youth of the early 90s, that are still looked up to, by the youth of today.WAYNE'S WORLD is the story of two men, Wayne and Garth, who appear to be in their twenties, and their public access TV show, entitled Wayne's World. Their show includes heavy metal, sexy girls, crude humor, and language and phrases such as, ""party on"" and ""rock out,"" characteristic of the early 90s youth. Although the typical teenager of the early 90s may not have modeled his/her behavior directly from the characters of WAYNE'S WORLD, WAYNE'S WORLD has significantly influenced many teenagers' attitudes, expressions, and perception of what it means to be ""cool.""WAYNE'S WORLD is unique on several fronts. For one, the director, PENELOPE SPHEERIS and writer, MIKE MEYERS use many innovative techniques to express the plot and tell the story. Wayne and Garth walk of screen or under tables on several occasions to whisper to the camera and the viewer, what they are thinking or something that they wish to expose to the viewer but not other characters. This filming technique enhances the viewers connection and appreciation for the characters. It allows for viewers to become more involved in the film and its characters and enter ""Wayne's World"" for the 95 minutes of this film.WAYNE'S WORLD, despite what rating it gets on IMDb or from other critics, will always remain a classic among teenagers. Wayne and Garth are the admiral heroes who refused to sell out and be induced by the pressures of the real business and marketing world. Instead they created Wayne's World, where teenagers, partying and heavy metal reign supreme. WAYNE'S WORLD will be remembered as the story of two losers who succeed, and make the big time, without selling out their ideas, and original inspiration. As every genre and generation has its classics to relate other films to, WAYNE'S WORLD is a classic among the youth of America.",,Anonymous,Music
It`s party time!!!,"This film was inspired from the TV series, and they did a great job in making a movie of it. Mike Myers and Dana Carvy make a great comedy Duo. they have the task of saving their TV show from the money hungry Benjamin.Wayne meets the girl of his dreams in the shape of Tia Carrere, What a HOT babe!!!.Cameo from Alice Cooper, did a great job, better than the sequel. I give it a 6 and a half out of 10.",,Anonymous,Music
THE  BEST TEEN  MOVIE  EVER MADE!!!!,"This movie rocks!!!! Its better than every teen movie ever made. And the funniest. Mike Myers is the king of comedy! He didn't make a bad movie since except that god-awful 54 movie. Rent this movie today, you'll laugh at this film so hard. Much better than both of the Austin Powers films.****",,Anonymous,Music
Party on!,"Love this film.  Instant classic.  Great acting, great soundtrack, great cast, no film like this one!  #3 favourite movie of all time.  I particularly liked Garth, because he reminds me of myself at times (i.e. when he was trying to talk to the beautiful blonde).  Excellent movie, party on!",,Anonymous,Music
wow!,"the first time i heard about this film( about 6 years ago) i thought it would be crap, how wrong i was. Mike myers is hilarious( as usual), as the scruffy rock lover wayne and delivers an outstanding performance. Dana carvey is also brilliant but was better in the sequel The only performance that i think wasn't as good was bob lowe. It was OK needed a bit more liveliness than he gave. The best performance was by far in the supporting role of tia carrere. her voice was incredible and she was brilliantly cast in the role as rock chick cassandra an excellent 9/10",,Anonymous,Music
"The Best Film Based on ""Saturday Night Live"" Material (Not Saying Much)","""Wayne's World"" is not a very good film, but when compared to other ""Saturday Night Live""-based ventures it looks like a masterpiece.  The moronic Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) have the opportunity to make a lot of money with their public-access television show and jump at the opportunity, in spite of numerous consequences.  Not a total mess, but far from being a cinematic classic.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Music
One of the best movies ever made,"This movie is by far one of the very best movies ever made. These guys are like idols. It was great seeing a pair of grown ups who still know how to party, rather than pot-smoking teens. Its always the same old deal, but not with this movie. This movie is pure instant classic. A must-see for all teens. Although most of the world has already seen this great film, I never ever get sick of it.Rock's Rating: 5 out of 5",,Anonymous,Music
