Total tearjerker falsely billed as a romantic comedy,"I saw this movie on a girls-night-out to the movies, and we chose it on the basis of the previews, which had billed it as a romantic comedy. Wow, were they ever wrong! The basic plot is this: Woman loses husband far too early and tragically. Woman grieves for husband, hard. Husband, through a plan pre-arranged before his death, sends woman letters at set intervals, each one causing a fresh stream of tears to fall.The acting was great. Hillary Swank was particularly good in her role, and let us see her vulnerability and conflicting emotions. The supporting cast was all excellent, and ladies, there is more than enough male eye candy in this movie to go around.But - and I strongly warn all of you considering this as a light comedy or a date movie - it's sad. Very very sad. Even the happy parts are sad. If you go see this, wear waterproof mascara and bring lots of tissues. Don't say I didn't warn you.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An overall enjoyable chick flick and good date movie,"(Synopsis) Holly (Hilary Swank) has been married nine years to a wild Irishman, Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler), and her one true love. Unfortunately for Holly, Gerry is diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor. Knowing he only has a short time to live; Gerry writes Holly a series of letters that will guide her through her grief. The first message arrives on Holly's 30th birthday. Gerry has sent her a birthday cake and a tape recording explaining the letters that she will be getting in the mail. Over the next year, Gerry wants Holly to follow the orders in his letters by going on new adventures and to celebrate life by finding herself. Holly's best friends, Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon), accompany her on her journey. Gerry always signs off each letter with ""P.S. I Love You.""(My Comment) This is definitely a chick flick that will not only make you cry, but make you laugh, plus the women will fall in love with Gerard Butler. Gerard was excellent in his part and Hilary did a fine job as well. At first I didn't think Hilary could pull off the romantic comedy role, but in the end you get use to her doing it. Hilary actually makes you feel her pain and how devastated she was when her husband died. I guarantee you that you will tear up during several scenes. Overall it was an enjoyable chick flick that you can take a date. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:06, Rated PG-13) (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
P.S. = Pleasant Surprise,"Generally speaking, I dislike the romantic American tearjerker dramas especially films like 'Titanic'. So i tend to avoid them. A few that I have liked include 'Far and Away' and 'The English Patient' (which was much more than the average movie of this genre). What interested me about 'P.S. I Love You' was the interesting ensemble cast. Now that I have watched the film, I must say that it came as a pleasant surprise.I found it very fresh: the cast which brings together talents like Lisa Kudrow, Kathy Bates and Hilary Swank; the idea of shooting in Ireland was very refreshing and the beautiful locations were so wonderfully shot that it just makes one want to visit the beautiful country; the screenplay, yes it is flawed as there are a few corny moments and some of the situations are a little too convenient but most of the dialogues are great, the comedic undertone is mostly welcoming and not misplaced, the ending is different from what one would expect; the soundtrack which adds more life into the moments.It's ironic that just the other day I watched 'Reign Over Me' which also dealt with 'grieving over' lost loved ones. Both films were totally different but it was interesting to see how the central character of both films deal, or more correctly, fail to cope with their losses in different ways. Both the writer and director LaGravenese put a lot of heart into 'P.S. I Love You' and the film is strengthened by the chemistry of the actors.Both Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler are excellent. The chemistry between them is electric. Swank gracefully shows Holly's transition from the whiny but loving working wife to the lonely widow. In a flashback scenes we see her brilliantly pull off the naive teenager. It's no surprise that the woman can act. Butler is terrific as the charming, lively and funny Gerry but his grasp of the Irish accent is disastrous. Lisa Kudrow provides comic relief. The actress gives a natural performance with shades of her famous Phoebe Buffay character (which I didn't mind as I miss Phoebe) but I wish she was given more screen time. Even Gina Gershon springs a surprise with a decent performance. Kathy Bates's acting is beautifully restrained. Harry Connick Jr. too adds some comedy (which might not appeal to all).'P.S. I Love You' makes for a good rainy day film. It might not appeal to all as there are a few fluffy corny moments but the film does make its point well and for me it was worth a watch.",,Anonymous,Romance
"P.leasantly S.weet, I liked it, but it is just good, not great","Holly (Hillary Swank) has been married for a number of years to handsome Gerry (Gerard Butler), an Irish gentleman. Wed at 19, he is the only love of her life and they have big plans for the future. Sadly, however, Gerry is stricken with cancer and dies, leaving Holly desolate. But, much to her surprise, letters start arriving from Gerry, under unusual circumstances, letters that provide encouragement for Holly to move forward with her life. Gerry suggests that Holly do some karaoke and take a trip to Ireland, where she should learn to fish and visit his relatives. It doesn't' hurt that Holly has two loving friends (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon), a hovering mother (Kathy Bates), and a good-looking new friend (Harry Connick, Jr.) looking out for her, also. But, can Holly truly overcome the serious blow that life has given her? This is a sweet movie but, I must confess, I was a wee bit disappointed. Yes, I loved the basic story and the cast is beyond terrific. Swank is quite nice as the young widow while Butler is greatly engaging as the husband, with many of his scenes told in flashback. In fact, Butler is a new favorite among American women, thanks to Dear Frankie, and let us all hope we see much more of him. Kudrow, Gershon, Bates, Connick Jr., and some of the Irish players are just right, too, breathing more life into a script that is erratic and sometimes contrived. Of course, the sets in Manhattan and Ireland are very wonderful, as are the costumes and great camera work. But, the film could have used more careful direction and editing, in my view. However, all fans of romantic comedy should not miss it, no. As the fountain of romcom films has considerably dried up in the last two years, any new entry is a hearty meal for the starving. Just do not expect another Music and Lyrics this time around.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very relevant movie for me,"As a husband who has a wife battling for her life with recurrent ovarian cancer, this movie struck very close to home. We a both in our late 20's and I am facing the possibility of burying my wife far to young, so suffice to say we both went to the movie and had a hard time keeping the eyes dry. There is nothing worse then prospect or actuality of burying your lover and your friend. I know this movie got a lot of negative reviews but when you see your life mirrored on the big screen you can't help but be moved by her struggle to move on and his undying love for her. I see another reviewer said to keep the boyfriends/husbands home, these people obviously have not faced such tragic circumstances. Usually I'd be the first to tear apart a click flick, but this didn't feel as clich√© as most and I liked how the ending wasn't as predictable as click flick movies usually are.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Biggest Tear Jerker in years,"This movie will make you cry and make you fall in love with Gerlad Butler(what a guy what an accent yum) definitely a chick flick my friend was crying by the second scene however in amongst all the sniffles was some laughs and overall I did enjoy the movie. While Gerlad and Jeffrey Morgan were both excellent Hillary well it's not that she was bad, just unexpected I'm not used to seeing her play this type of part and I just don't think she is suited to the role would the movie have been better without her probably not a standard rom-com actress definitely would have pushed it over the edge into bad territory. Overall an enjoyable chick flick definitely one to take your mum and girlfriends to just don't forget the tissues !",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nine reasons not to watch this movie,"1. You are past puberty 2. You value your free time 3. You dislike cheesy lines 4. You have suffered a real loss in life 5. You have a reasonable sense of humor 6. You don't enjoy a predictable story 7. You value your intelligence 8. The movie is wrongly classified as ""drama romance"", but it is really a romanticized, imaginary, phony, fantastic way that a teen or someone who is completely detached sees an adult life (a science fiction perhaps?). When you watch movies that are described as comedies, you know what to expect. But here, you are mislead into believing that this is grounded in real life. Well, it isn't. 9.

Helping Lost People Finding Where Their Hearts Are,"People change in time, relationships change in time; Love doesn't. A man expresses his feelings of his love to his wife, through several shocking surprises after his death. This movie would tell why love is the only power that connects people, if no one could tell anymore what it really means. Gerry and Holly's relationship is a good example of how couples bring their love to the end quickly.Leading actors Swank and Butler accomplished wholeheartedly acting jobs. A true success with Harry Connick Jr.'s role playing Holly's first flirt, but poor acting from Jeffrey Dean Morgan(whom we'll see him in ""Watchmen"" next year) playing as her second. As a novel adaptation, the screenplay is effectual. Some parts of the script is totally noticeable that hold our attention continuously. I liked the editing job very well after I've seen the deleted scenes from the special features of the DVD. The music score is so relaxing and emotional. Everybody keeps telling this film is a tearjerker, which I disagree; it's only because of the sensational existence of Hilary Swank. Her talented way of expressing psychological trauma just catches eyes, that's all.There are 5 of my favorite scenes which I rewind each time I watch: 1*One of the greatest opening scenes for a romance of all time. In that scene just in 2 minutes, we get what type of personalities each character has. Lovers find a quarrel over a straw. They yell at each other, and Gerry leaves Holly getting out of the door. A minute passes or not, Holly comes back from bathroom and Gerry back from the door. Then they wildly lock in a close embrace after running towards to each other into the middle of the living room... 2*After the funeral of Gerry, at a time when Holly's longing of him hits the top, she can't help herself calling the home-phone from her cellphone just to listen to Gerry's voice from his answering machine record; while trying to sleep... 3*Holly's receiving of Gerry's first P.S.I Love You letter and his true guesses of what Holly is going to say in respond after his each time of gaffes... 4*Gerry's calling to memory of their first meeting in Ireland, from his words... 5*And best of all, my best favorite scene: Holly's return to karaoke stage singing ""Love You Till The End"" and imagining as if he is there forming a lonesome audience. This scene is the one I burst into tears. I don't remember myself crying because of a movie, or because of someone else's sadness ever; including the end of Dr.Zhivago or Love Story or The English Patient. Yet it just reminded me of a photo of my fianc√©e with whom we were parted away. In that photo she was standing on a step of an amphitheater watching my mockery of a stand-up show at the stage, forming the whole audience herself.This is a therapeutic relationship movie. Watch it with your partner and you'll be able to see the missing, lacking or the incomplete part of your unity. Strongly recommended for couples who used to be in love before. Find out why love is eternal.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I wanted to like this but couldn't,"Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) and husband Gerry (Gerard Butler) seem to have a happy marriage. Gerry dies of a brain tumor...but it seems he has arranged to have Holly sent messages AFTER his death telling her how to get on with her life.OK--I love silly romance movies. ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is one of my favorites. This is VERY silly--but I didn't like it. For starters there are WAY too many love songs in it--I was getting he impression they were trying to sell a soundtrack album and could care less about the movie. Also they (stupidly) keep using clips from classic movies that had nothing to do with the plot. Seriously--WHY is Holly lip syncing to Judy Garland belting out ""The Man Who Got Away""? Also the love ""lessons"" here are utterly predictable. It's far too long (over 2 hours), is flatly directed and badly staged. Also some really bad acting doesn't help--Kathy Bates looks blank, Lisa Kudrow is astonishingly lousy at the comic bits (that's inexcusable for someone who was on ""Friends"") and James Marsters is given nothing to do. Also Hilary Swank (a wonderful actress) can't do much with a horribly clich√©d role. The plot rambles all over the place and there are WAY too many coincidences to believe in this.The few good points: There's a trip to Ireland and the movie makes good use of the beautiful locations there; Gina Gershon is just great in a small role; there's a nice flash of male nudity; Jeffrey Dean Morgan is just great as William (a guy Holly meets in Ireland) and Gerard Butler is fantastic. He's not in the movie too much and he overacts, but his performance is so good and he's so likable and handsome that he gives the movie a much needed jump start.Critics have savaged this. Now it's not good--but it's not a total bomb either. Butler made this movie bearable. I give it a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unashamedly reaches for the heart and fails to grasp.  Unless you want it to.,"A film aimed squarely at a female audience, P.S. I LOVE YOU.Holly Kennedy (the handsome Hilary Swank) is a young widow who finds that her late husband (Gerard Butler) has left her a series of letters to help her start a new life. She follows the instructions in the letters and, with the help of her friends, embarks on a journey of self-discovery.Films about love and human relationships are films that I enjoy most. Sadly, I was not able to connect with this film on any satisfactory level.The film starts perfectly. The opening minutes show a dispute between Holly and her husband and this is well done, energised by hand-held, sometimes out of focus camera work. But the scene is far too drawn out and, after five minutes, starts to feel like a rough cut and becomes tiring.In fact, the whole film is too drawn out and, at times, rather clumsy. Some scenes labour to be moving, smothered in sorrowful music, which only serves to distance the audience.There's comedy in the form of Lisa Kudrow playing a supportive friend, a leprechaun singing telegram and an Asperger's suffering love interest (Harry Connick Jr.) who says exactly what he thinks without any consideration for those around him.There's a certain unfairness to the late husband's letters. While they are well-intentioned, Holly develops an unhealthy dependence on them. And the subplot involving her father's separation from her mother (Kathy Bates) feels ""thrown in"" and makes the film uneven.Equally poor is the use of coincidence late in the story and the final scene which involves a meeting.P.S. I LOVE YOU constantly, unashamedly, reaches for the heart - without any tact or subtlety - and fails to grasp. Unless you want it to. Unless you are willing to overlook its very contrived scenes and clumsy construction and go along for the ride, to indulge in the tissues.",,Anonymous,Romance

Never trust the ratings,"As a guy, I have never been hit by a movie like this one. I went into this movie laying next to my girlfriend, expecting to be bored out of my mind.

I believe the acting was superb on everybody's part, with humor very well done.I never look at ratings for a movie, I read the back, or watch the trailers, and listen to ratings by trusted people I know. Never trust the ratings online or by critics, in any genre. Someone brought up the ratings on rottentomatoes, did they notice that over 95% of those ratings were from males? Now why would anybody in their right mind listen to a bunch of reviews by GUYS on a CHICK FLICK?

Not like the book at all!!!!   :(,"The movie itself was wonderful. The acting was great on all of their parts, but if you are looking for a movie that follows the book closely at all, you are in for a big disappointment. A few main characters were left out, along with a few scenes added on that should not have been in the movie at all. Overall, though, I liked the movie a lot.I do not think that Gerry should have been made as big of a part in this movie as he was portrayed as. In the book he was only briefly mentioned when it came to the letters. Also, all of Holly's family members seemed rather harsh when it came to her dealing with the problems, in the book it all went a bit more smoothly.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
P.S. Move On,"In a poignant scene Gerald Butler's spirit of Gerry confesses to Hilary Swank's Holly, ""I'm not asking you to remember me¬Ö"" and to move on. Although being a little too long, Writer and Director Richard LaGravenese's ""P.S. I Love You"" is a whimsical and surprisingly touching romantic comedy about life continuing forward. Swank and LaGravenese have collaborated before on ""Freedom Writers"" as evidenced in the movie's comfortable and sturdy feel. Hilary Swank is great in this romantic comedy, an edgy departure for the actor. Swank thrives--she never forces the humor, completely natural. She embodies a humanity and spirit in Holly that makes her vulnerable and funny in the story's context. Gerald Bulter is boldly charming as Holly's late husband Gerry, the Irishman full of life and dreams. Swank and Butler have a wondrous chemistry that smooths out the rougher edges of LaGravenese and Steve Rogers screenplay based on the novel by Wendy Finerman.Even with its over wrought indulgences, ""P.S. I Love You"" rewards the narrative payoff. Wisely on the part of LaGravenese and Rogers, the catharsis opts for the lyrical and realm of possibility. The performances are stellar. Academy Award Winner Kathy Bates is awesome as Holly's mother Patricia. Seeing fellow Oscar Winner Swank and Bates together is truly something special. There is a heartbreaking scene where Swank's Holly breaks down to her mother saying, ""I'm alone!"" Later Bates's Patrica says to her daughter, ""¬ÖIf you're all alone, we're all together with you in that, too."" So even with its intentional quirks and cheesy trappings-- all is forgiven, because ultimately ""P.S. I Love You"" is about the courage to love again and live life.As ""P.S"" opens Holly is furious that Gerry told her mother at dinner that they are not planning on having kids right now. Although accurate, Holly is still livid. Holly laments that she is waiting for her life to start. Gerry reminds, ""We are in life¬Ö"" Transparent to us: Gerry and Holly are soul mates¬óthe great love of each other's life. Fast forward several months, Gerry has died of a brain tumor. After the wake, Holly discovers that Gerry has arranged for the delivery of his letters all making requests of Holly. Unable or perhaps unwilling to move on after her loss, this may not be the best thing for Holly. Or is it a way for Holly to discover life anew?Much of the movie's charm derives from Holly's trip to Gerry's Irish homeland, and her loyal friends. Lisa Kudrow plays Denise, Holly's gal pal who is crassly determined to hunt down a single, straight, and employed man¬óa crusade seemingly more difficult than it seems. Kudrow is at her scattered and hysterical best. Hot and sexy Gina Gershon plays other gal pal Sharon. Gershon is deceivingly strong and smart with the apparently vapid Sharon, who really possesses a depth of character. In a surprising moment in what initially feels like a frivolously long fishing scene with all three women, reminds Holly that her friends are moving on with their lives. Holly's trip to Ireland is a beautiful interlude that represents an eloquent return to the traditional and solid. Here LaGravenese brilliantly orchestrates his story of love everlasting and regret. Hilary Swank amazingly balances the suffering and resolute spirit in Holly. She too is brilliant and absolutely beautiful. Her smile just lights up your soul, and her anguish strikes an emotional chord. Gerald Butler is at his charismatic best. Butler also expertly tempers his charm with a touching and gentle compassion.""P.S. I Love You"" is one of the best romantic comedies in a long while, that has a great love story. Richard LaGravenese tells a wistful and touching tale with amazing performances and chemistry by Hilary Swank and Gerald Butler. Take a chance on ""P.S. I Love You"".",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Indispensable for the whole family. Love between man and woman, love between friends, between family, for life, and gives us great lessons of life and especially to overcome","PS comes from the Latin post scriptum, meaning ""after writing"" and came from the need to add something in a letter after the signature or foreclosure. Currently the feature is now used as a supplement or partial explanation, csual or whole. PS I Love You is based Based on the book of the Irish writer Cecelia Ahern, director Richard LaGravenese writes in partnership with Steven Rogers this adaptation, which like the pages of the book, has won millions of hearts around the world with a captivating story and dosing drama and romance.Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) is married to Gerry (Gerard Butler), an Irish funny for who is completely in love. Both live in New York, are together a long time and have yet to financial stability necessary to have a child, something he dreamed much, but it shows that it is feasible. But when Gerry dies of a brain tumor, Holly's life also ends, as she goes into a deep depression. But what she did not expect was that, imagining that this could happen, Gerry has left her several letters before she died. Each seeks to guide Holly in the way of your recovery not only of pain for your loss but also of his own rediscovery.Analyze romantic comedies is becoming a chore lately. This genre repeats every title the same predictable story and countless clich√©s and we can count on a movie that has something new or different approach. During life can have several love experiences, some more and some less significant, but there are few people who manage to find love, respect, affection, friendship and admiration simultaneously in another and have it all fully matched. For some, the search for someone to complete takes a lifetime and others sometimes even happens. It's not every day that two young people with a whole story to go sure those feelings. And when a terrible fate would not allow this love to continue in life, seems to be the end of the world for those who stayed. The film focuses on the Holy difficulty in dealing with the death of her husband and the feelings that surtem letters on it. Death, even being addressed, is not the main focus, but the journey of Holly in overcoming their pain.The film begins showing the chemistry between Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler, which is an essential factor to get involved in the story, with a typical discussion with a couple of text and intelligent. Swank is known for emotionally-laden dramas, winning the best actress Oscar for Boys Do not Cry (1999) and Million Dollar Baby (2004), and Butler has starred in dramas like great Dear Frankie (2004) and mostly action films like Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life (2003) and the most striking part of his career to date to air live the king Leonidas in 300 (2006). At first the two might not be the most obvious couple to bring forward the romance, but the relationship of the characters overflows empathy with the public. Within minutes of interaction between the two, we have already noted how the lovers love each other. When the next scene already shows the funeral of Gerry, and we already know how strong must be the pain for the loss of Holly.This resumption of life, Holly goes to a nightclub, singing in a karaoke, buy a lamp, makes a trip with best friends, etc.. Tips are simple but meaningful that helps. Besides the letters, Holy is his mother Patricia (Kathy Bates) who over the end will have a key role in the recovery of the child, and very close as friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon), which give a touch of humor largest plot with the peculiarities of the female universe. The three friends will cause hilarious moments with clever jokes, and also dramatic moments (such as the sequence in which Holly gets to be the maid of honor). The actresses can move from humor to the drama in just a few minutes so impressive.Holly suffers a lot in the movie. Having an actress with the ability and true to cross the dramatic arc of the character as Hilary Swank has made all the difference. Gerry, even though he died in the early scenes, is present throughout the film through flashbacks that show from when the two met in Ireland to the latest moments before his death. These flashbacks present at all times operate and serve to bring the protagonists increasingly with viewers. Kathy Bates is wonderful as Holly's mother, Patricia. At first she did not eat very sympathetic relationship between daughter and Gerry, but in the course of the plot will reveal that she has a fundamental role in the recovery of his daughter. It is one of the most complex characters.For the film to work on the issue we highlight the work of David Moritz (lizabethtown (2005)) that frequently leads from past to present without ever letting the pace drop, always being helped by the script full of tips for transitions. The versatile John Powell (X-Men 3 - The Last Stand (2007)) uses the track for the sake of romance and dramas experienced. The result is divine, knowing thrill every time. The track also contains the great ""Same Mistake"" by James Blunt, """" Last Train Home ""by Ryan Star,"" P-S - I Love You ""Nellie McKay,"" Love You 'Till The End ""by The Pogues, among other. Photography and art direction by Terry Stacey is also a case apart to create some of the best scenes of bucolic and charming romance in Ireland, among other scenarios.The combination of the soundtrack, magnificent scenery, intelligent text and great actors accredit the movie to be one of the best of the genre in recent years. Even falling in some clich√©s, the film is hardly handler. The theme of death and emotional recovery by itself is different and that make us predisposed to greater involvement with the story. The film is certainly well above average. Indispensable for couples and for the whole family. The sincere love and true being portrayed with exquisite sensitivity. Love between man and woman, love between friends, between family, for life, and gives us great lessons of life and especially to overcome.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Oh dear, How embarrassing","As an American ex pat, living in the UK for 8 years, this movie was a total embarrassment. Who watches this stuff (in the USA?)? I only watched it because my 12 year old was having a cinema party and THEY wanted to watch it. The acting was atrocious, the story line was probably written by a cheerleader who likes Ireland or something. It was Hollywood at it's worst. Please, if you think you are going to do a film partly about a European country, have some Europeans on board who will advise you how schmaltzy a film can be for the rest of the world (and don't release it over here). The theatre was pretty empty and I can see why. Waste of 6 pounds for me. The main actress was so annoying to watch and look at, those teeth, my goodness.... Only redeeming qualities were the shots of NYC and Ireland and a rather good conversation between the mother and daughter towards the end.

Her journey is made special by her late husband's loving surprises that he secretly organised before he died.""P.S. I Love You"" is a romantic drama that makes you cry.

Men and Women and Romance in Real Life,"Everybody: Oh, please.For what this film sought out to portray, it did an excellent job. Kudos to the actors, the cinematographer, et al.I do wish that nowadays all men who merely look what we used to call ""nice"" (i.e., not ugly, almost attractive) are suddenly anointed with being GORGEOUS. Well, yeah, gorgeous if you compare them to most of what's out there in the way of heterosexual males. (Males often feel it is their God-given right to ""let themselves go,"" to walk around with huge paunches, balding pates, grease-stained togs, foul breath, etc., and still be considered ""real catches."" Why? Because they're MEN! There's this inordinate male pride going on in our society now, along with a sense of entitlement (are you SURE this isn't 1955?), and all women are expected to bow down to the ""obviously superior male"" of the species. That includes calling them GORGEOUS when they are, in fact, what we used to call just ""nice"" looking. Nowadays, there are a million films out, starring guys who could only be called very unattractive in anyone's book, and their love interests are always played by truly gorgeous females. What's with that? I am not the only one who noticed this. A reporter for the L.A. Times, plus many other reporters online, have noticed this trend, too.The guy in the film who played the deceased spouse? He was nice looking. But ""gorgeous""? I don't THINK so! Try looking at Alain Delon in his 20s! Now THAT is gorgeous. And there's nothing out there even remotely like him nowadays.I tho't Hilary Swank did well in this film. I do take issue with the screenwriter, though. That big fight that Hilary had with her spouse early on in the film that most people here loved? Horrible!!! Hilary's character was being whiny and just looking for a reason, it seems, to be angry. She was not angry for any valid reason. Luckily, by the time a female gets more mature, she realizes the folly of starting fights over little itty bitty things such as were portrayed in this film. Hell, had I been the character married to the character played by Hilary, I would have told her precisely what I thought of her pettiness --- before walking out on her and slamming the door! Still, all in all, a nice fantasy (that men can really be as considerate and loving as the guy in the film). We who have been around the block awhile know that, of course, these guys do not exist in real life.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Funny romantic comedy with flashbacks that makes us all want to figure out the world of love, life, and relationships.","""P.S. I Love You"" is certainly a pretty funny and touching romantic comedy that leaves the viewer with laughs while mostly the story of gone love is told by flashbacks. Yet the film proves a point that love, relationships, and happiness is always a constant search. Really the big negative on the film is that really no chemistry is developed or so it seems with the central characters. You have Hilary Swank in a decent performance as Holly Kennedy a woman married to hunky Irish singer Gerry(Gerard Butler). Holly is depressed because her big hobby is collecting shoe heels while she desperately wants a baby, yet her hubby is playing hard yet both still passionately and strongly love one another. Suddenly despite Gerry's good looks and life the films take a massive twist all of a sudden switching to his death brought on by an apparent brain tumor? Then for the next year the theme is love only by love letters that were written by Gerard before his death, the chemistry of the present is so little as Holly daydreams so much getting much of her pleasure by remembering and flashbacks. Yet the movie has much wit and funny one liners the acting from Hilary was well done and Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon provide witty laughs as Hilary's best friends Denise and Sharon one a husband hunter and the other an expecting mother respectively. The biggest and most hidden strong point of the film is the direct and caring performance from Kathy Bates as Patricia which is Hilary's mother. And Hilary provides some sexy and funny scenes and just to mention Harry Connick Jr. gives a likable performance as Holly's potential love interest. Overall nothing special not really enough chemistry or enough deep character development, but still watchable proving that in life and love the unexpected happens and that one should try and cherish every moment especially when one has it. As the film proves when one is searching and trying to rediscover love it's many times an ongoing search that we all just try to still figure out and search for happiness and new discovery. With most importantly breaking away from a gripped love hold past.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great Movie, Must See Romantic Comedy.","My most favorite romantic chick flick the last two years!! What makes this movie so great is if you have no expectation. Because of reviews and not thinking Hilary Swank could pull off romantic made this movie shine. She pulls it off and the movie is way better than the reviews. Tear Jerker! The shining happy moments are definitely the comedy relief Harry Connick Jr. brings. He is good in this movie... sexy... charming and hilarious. This movie has a great ending and just is so beautiful. I read half the book and wow, the movie makes the book look bad. The movie is better than the book!Now I love seeing girly movies, mostly they have disappointed me or been just okay. This one was better than all the rest.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Irish proud,"This is beautiful movie. I just can't forget it. Love will save us all and nothing stops. Irish landscapes and American body song'd said everything. This book was written by daughter of prime minister of Ireland. For those who doesn't know who she is, can go on Google, of course. Ireland proud and Irish luck is the thing which presents the hope in the dark hours for me. I've cigarette addiction and problems with asthma, so I use some drugs from Alvogen pharmaceuticals which was company of the year in 2015. I'm fan of U2 and The Orthodox Celts( Serbian Irish sound band ). This movie is really special because love between man and a woman is something what always wins.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An emotive, implausible romantic movie with real chemistry - 76%","My Better Half had been bugging me to go and watch this since it was released and yesterday, I finally relented. Mind you, I wasn't completely reluctant - this film has been receiving a great deal of good praise heaped upon and frankly, I was surprised it was still on at the cinema after being released ages ago so it must have been doing something right, I figured. And it does - this is a real emotional roller-coaster of a movie and is the first film I've seen in ages that has a real tangible chemistry between the two leads.Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler play Holly & Gerry Kennedy, a happily married couple of nine years struggling to make ends meet in a tiny apartment and limited income. When Gerry passes away due to a brain tumour, Holly's world falls apart and she becomes increasingly isolated and withdrawn from her mother (Kathy Bates) and her friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon). But a surprise letter on her birthday arrives from Gerry and it's the start of a long healing process as each letter arrives and helps her overcome her grief.Personally, I felt that the plot was too convoluted to be believable - whilst undeniably romantic, the timing of each delivery was simply too convenient. The camera also had an annoyingly shaky temperament, reminiscent of ""The Blair Witch Project"" although nothing like as bad, which also put me off slightly. However, what cannot be denied is the powerful performance from Swank as the grieving widow failing to cope with her loss. Butler is also very good, totally different from his bare-chested machismo in ""300"". The scenes between the two are far and away the most entertaining and the most plausible - my Better Half was laughing during the opening moments, claiming that they were just like us! And she was right - the chemistry between Butler and Swank is incredible and really makes the movie far better than it has any right to be. But away from the romance and tragedy, there are several lighter moments that also work well, though nothing gut-bustingly funny. Harry Connick Jr has the best lines, though Kudrow pushes him as the man-eating Denise.I wasn't expecting that much from this but ""P.S. I Love You"" is a real gem of a film, providing laughs and tears in equal measures and is thoroughly recommended. It isn't often that a film can cover multiple genres and do them justice (""Shaun Of The Dead"" is probably the best example I can think of) but this is a happy surprise. It's unconventional, brilliantly written and wonderfully shot - viewers not used to sweeping shots of rural Ireland are in for a treat. It's a shame the camera-work is unnecessarily wobbly and the supporting cast are largely anonymous - Gershon is barely noticeable next to Kudrow. But you'd be quite daft to miss this movie which deserves every bit of good praise heaped on it due to terrifically emotive performances from the leads, a romantic (if implausible) plot and genuinely amusing scenes. Maybe I should start listening to my Better Half a bit more...",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Drama? Romantic Comedy? Who cares?  This is the best film EVER!,"I have never felt compelled to leave a comment about a film until i saw P.S. I Love You. The emotional journey of the story was engulfing and intense. The comical and dramatic aspects of the film were both nurtured and explored deeply. I've never cried and laughed at the same time.I would absolutely recommend anyone to watch this film. In fact, after watching it with my mom I plan to watch it with my boyfriend!Lastly, I would recommend that you watch the deleted scenes.

"An average date movie, very mistaken.","I've been a fan of Gerard Butler in chains of movies that showed his talent and it was recently a surprise for me to found out that he made a project with Hilary Swank featuring a date movie of romance and comedy genre. However the reviews I thought so convincing and very much true to depict what the movie was really about. A lot of people says that it was instead a dramatic love story rather than a romantic comedy, they were wrong, and others also shared that it was a tear-jerker movie since after the advent of ""The Notebook""¬óand exactly they were wrong again. My anticipation for this film was half-thwarted. I thought that it was a movie that would sincerely pinch my heart and make my eyes go tear-falling unnoticed but I was wrong, truly this film is half-disappointing. It was mostly drenched with tedious conversations, which had bored me most for the first 30 minutes then the next 30 then another next 30¬Öit seems that the remarks of people concerning this film was so overstated or exaggerated, and they dare to compare it with ""The Notebook""? please give me a break! It did not even moved my heart and my feelings to feel for a moment Holly's despair and resentment over her husband's death, but honestly a little¬óabout that scene where Holly keeps on calling Gerry's cellphone until she fell asleep, that was a vestige of a good drama flick. But when the movie progresses it wasn't at all that ""progressing"". It saddened me that, Gerard Butler, whom according to my findings wanted to call him Gerry instead of Gerard due to pronunciation conflicts, and whom I loved so much for his excellent acting career and real life achievements, was ineffectively utilized in this film. I believe I'm not the only one alone with this estimation, but to compensate it was still a capably nice average date movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
P.S I Love the movie,"Fell in love with the movie that brings you the harsh reality of life. Before watching the movie I personally didn't like the lead casts but the on screen chemistry between Swank and Butler is good. The soundtrack is cool. A special mention to 'Fairytale of New York' song played at the start (Lyrics not suitable for children). Even though the movie carried some comic scenes, it is sentimental in most parts which are lovable, in my opinion. It is difficult to see characters in Hollywood like Holly who is a loyal wife to Gerry. The conversation between the mother and the daughter at the end is my favorite part. Must appreciate the camera shots in Ireland and were good. The bottom line : many of you who read the review may not agree with my ratings but this one is heartwarming and you can watch it once with your loved ones.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
PS the book was FAR superior..,"I absolutely LOVED the book but the film did not do it justice. I found the characters, in particular Daniel and Holly's mum to be obnoxious. They were all incredibly unsympathetic to someone who had just lost the love of her life. Gerard Butler's accent was dreadful but I can forgive that man pretty much anything! I agree that the Gerry flashbacks were cheesy and cringe-worthy, also the depiction of their relationship at the start didn't do them justice at all. It didn't show the love they had for each other. And using 'Fairytale....' for the funeral. Talk about a clich√©! I expected to cry buckets at the film, like I did with the book but it didn't happen.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not just a chick flick,"To be fully honest, I'm not one for what we know as ""chick-flicks"" because of their tendency to be as predictable as a crystal ball or as cheesy as cheese. However, hearing that Gerard Butler and James Marsters were both in this film together, seeing as I adore both actors for many different reasons, I thought I might be able to stomach it and maybe even have a laugh.By the end of the film, I found this film to be more than just a ""chick-flick""; it was instead a bittersweet story about a young widow, played by the strongly talented Hilary Swank, coping with the death of her husband through letters that he'd written for her teaching her how to live and remember how to be happy with herself. All in all, I'd say it was a great film. It was one of those film that can make you smile, scream, laugh and cry and the writers capture the audiences emotions beautifully.The writer has clearly gone through the same situation of losing a loved one because if I'm not mistaken, I do recall hearing my grandmother going through the same emotions that Swank's character was going through after her own husband passed away.The acting in the film is perfectly done. Butler, though he can't hold an Irish accent very well, plays the role of a goofball perfectly, especially in his striptease scene and when he was watching his wife sing a sexy karaoke tune (poor guy was trying to contain himself while covering Marsters' eyes). Swank is also hilarious and in a scene when she's crying in an emotional breakdown, she plays it more realistically than I have ever seen on film.What is also great about the film is that it rebels against most romantic comedies by practically spoofing typical chick-flick events, which was a great relief to me, since the recycled plots that I see in too many films and books nowadays (*cough*Enchanted*cough*) gets more than just annoying. Out of ten, I will give it a nine because the only problem I had with the film was Butler's accent. Other than that, it was a great film with a well-chosen cast and a well-written script.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

All moms are like you okay? As soon as i said i watched ps i love you they all got it lol!

"Worth your time, but could've been better","I must say the movie is not as I expected. I'm not saying that it's bad, it's just very different from the novel. There are so many things the screenwriter changed and it kinda makes me sad. When you read the novel, you can feel the ups and downs of Holly's emotional. It tells you more about the pain and the grief she went through after Gerry's gone, and how she handled her own feelings as an ordinary woman who just lost her long-loved husband. I actually want to see more of how her family and friends helped her through the journey in the movie, because I think they also have major roles in making Holly realized how she had so many people that were more than willing to support her through anything and that they also had a special connection with Gerry I'm also disappointed because the story didn't stick truly to the novel because it has a better plot. Regardless, it's a movie that's worth your time and will make you learn about all the valuable things in life and how you should find the true meaning of happiness with your loved ones.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nauseating,"The words that came up for me: Pretentious, contrived, melodramatic. It shows a character who is completely immature and dysfunctional. The budding of the romance shown in a flashback was cringe worthy. There is nothing believable about how the ""natives"" of Ireland are portrayed. Really, there was nothing about the movie that I can say something positive about, and normally, I can salvage some element or two. Normally, I put watched DVDs out in the open for whomever might be interested, but in this case, I'm going to save everyone the mistake of checking it out. IMDb's star rating is often reflective of my view of films, but this is obviously an exception. The only one in my history of relying on IMDb ratings.",,Anonymous,Romance
Time to move on,"Gerard Butler does a great acting job in this movie. It's too bad that this movie is really more about Hillary Swank and her failure to come to grips with reality than it is about him.In the first scene of the movie, Gerard and Hillary are having a squabble. They've been married for a few years, have what seems to be a nice life, but Hillary is upset because she doesn't think that life will get any better. She carries this pessimistic attitude throughout the movie. They wind up making up and everything seems great.Next scene, life changes drastically when the scene is Gerard's Irish Pub style funeral. Boom, what a transition. How did we get from point A to point B? I was left pondering what was the purpose of that first scene. I've discussed this other friends and each one has a different theory.Anyway, the rest of the movie is about Hillary Swank's reluctance to get over Gerard's unexpected departure. She has a great group of friends and a mom who is very supportive, but Hillary would rather be depressed than move on. She gets letters from her departed husband and in his letters he gives her great advice... move on with your life. Yet she seems stuck in a rut that she has no desire to get out of. When she finally meets a man she's attracted to (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), she finds out that he's an old mate of Gerard's and that kind of ends that.Well, eventually, after 2 painful hours of watching her struggle, the movie finally wraps up. There's a guy who really likes her, but she's just not interested.There's no real ending here. Life just goes on and we all can hope that she gets over her loss. There's hope at the end, but we're really not sure.I give this movie 6 stars for the acting, which was superior. The story was fine and the characters were interesting.

Gorgeous Greenwich Village Gal,"Who would have thought Hilary Swank could be dolled up to look like Audrey Hepburn? I can't remember exactly what made me want to see this movie. Or to be honest, I do. It was the prospect of two hours filled with good looks and fancy dresses. Sadly, the divine Gina Gershon and ""Friends"" regular Lisa Kudrow have aged very badly. But Hilary Swank does indeed deliver on the poster's pretty girl promise. Everybody knows she isn't a natural beauty with her angular jaw, big teeth, and overly athletic physique. And, by the way, she *really* can't sing. Yet she is totally adorable in her preppy skirts, tailored coats, and designer shoes. And the Alice band! The Alice band gets me every time. Needless to say, the plot is laughable. Go see it anyway if you liked ""Local Hero"", ""The MatchMaker"", ""Dead by Monday"", ""Serendipity"", or ""Prime"". Or if you simply like the idea of Hilary Swank with an Alice band. Guest appearance by singer-songwriter Nellie McKay in the part of Holly's quirky blonde sister.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

P.S. I Love You,"I only give a 9 because I would have loved to be in the scenes with Gerard instead of Hilary!! This movie is getting mixed reviews, but I thought the truthfulness and honesty of it was totally on. When my dad died, I remember searching for any piece of him to hold on to. You definitely go through flashbacks in your head, so those were correct. All the men were amazing, but especially Gerard Butler. I have seen real bad movies with him in them, but he always shines. He seems to throw himself fully into every role he does, and his acting is superb. I'm a new fan - having finally, reluctantly watched Phantom of the Opera, but I was hooked by his performance in that, and can never believe how far he can stretch himself; whether it's the Phantom, a Spartan, a time traveler, a criminal, Dracula, whatever, the movie may get horrid ratings, but he's the gemstone in the dirt, no matter what. But other than that, go see this movie because it's a true analogy of life. You will be surprised when you don't cry and surprised when you do.This is signed Christopher, but it's from me,his wife, Laura. I realized after reading this, that you might have thought this was from a man, but it's from a hot-blooded female who was not struck blind at marriage!!P.S. My husband went to the movies to see ""I Am Legend,"" but came home and admitted that he went to see this movie. He really liked it quite a bit. I don't know if he cried, but he actually loves movies that are ""chick flicks."" What a mush! What a great guy!12/31/07 - I wanted to add a comment. ""Sweeney Todd"" got lots of nominations for awards. I couldn't stomach this movie - I almost got sick to my stomach watching it. I get upset that such a violent movie gets awards, yet a sweet movie like this does not. However, I did note that other people must feel the same way cause this past weekend ""P.S."" was #8 and Sweeney"" was #9, so maybe there is hope for the human race.5/17/08 - I know this movie is long past, and is out on DVD. The scene in the travel agency with Gerard Butler should not have been cut. That scene was beautiful, tender and funny all at once. My dad died of cancer, and that's exactly how he looked near the end - Gerard, my hat's off to you. Too bad the morons in Hollywood don't know that we've all dealt with death by cancer.

PS. I don't love this movie,"I had been told by numerous friends that this was a great movie and about how they all nearly went through a box of tissues with it. so naturally I was preparing for an emotionally engaging tear-jerker. but that was not what I got. at the end of the movie I found myself sitting there with my unused box of tissues thinking ""jeez i really need to get some new friends with decent taste in movies!"".I don't know what it was but I just found this movie unbelievably boring. all throughout it i found myself getting distracted and resorting to things like rolling around on the floor and sticking my finger in the pedestal fan to alleviate my boredom. I wish that I had stuck my head under that fan instead of sitting through the whole thing. I know, I could have turned it off, but I didn't want to. I suppose there was just some sadomasochistic part of me that wanted to continue, with a vague hope that it might get better even though deep down I suspected that it wouldn't and surprise, surprise - it didn't.I also found the acting in this movie terrible. Whether it was the actors themselves or merely the characters they were playing I don't know, but the combination certainly wasn't good whatever it was. The filming wasn't too bad pretty straight forward. One thing I could not stand though was the opening scene it went forever before they actually put the title of the movie up and began the opening credits which dragged on as well.the worst part about that opening scene was that it really didn't establish anything, except that they love each other which we might have figured from the title. it also set up the annoying character that Hilary swank was going to be for those painful 121 minutes. can't even understand why he loved her so much. I think a better start to the movie would have been the scene were jerry is dying, then the credits, then the funeral or something, I dunno. At least this way his death wouldn't have been so mysterious.I mean one minute he's there then a few minutes and what felt like a life time of boring credits later he's died? what's with that? show us how he died. You think that us viewers aren't clever enough to figure out that in a film named ""PS, I love you"" the leads love each other, but we can figure out how he died. Yes I know we hear later that it was a tumor, but I just don't think it should have been done like that.this was not the movie I expected, it was much, much worse than i could have ever possibly anticipated. it hasn't left me with tear stained cheeks or a desire for such a romance for myself as I suspect it intended to do. rather it has left me with nothing more than a full tissue box, an angry demeanor and a sincere wish that I had stuck my neck under the fan.PS.

If you're going to invest 126 mins of your time you should be prepared for a few things...,"Is it a ""romantic comedy"" as the DVD box advertises? Dear lord no.
Is it a hard hitting drama about love, death and loss? At times it flirts with the idea, but ultimately... no.
Is it a sappy Hallmark Channel melodrama of the week? Sort of. But the A-list actors and impressive cinematography seem to demand more respect than that.
So what is it?Ultimately ""PS I Love You"" is a decent way to spend 126 minutes of your time if you're in the mood for light romantic fare. The story is about a 30-year old woman (Hilary Swank) attempting to navigate the troubled waters of being a young widow after her perfect husband dies. Complicating matters, she begins receiving mysterious letters that had been apparently penned by her dying husband to be sent to her in regular installments, sort of leading her on an adventure of rediscovery. Yes, the plot is excellent, based on the novel by Cecelia Ahern. But as you may have guessed by my opening points, the execution is a bit uneven and ultimately disappointing, given the tremendous potential here.Hilary Swank definitely delivers with both breezy scenes as well as powerful, emotional scenes. But the film felt like it didn't want to showcase her dramatic talents as much as it wanted to keep things light-hearted and uncomplicated. I would have loved to see this film directed by someone like maybe Lasse Hallstr√∂m (Chocolat, Cider House Rules, Safe Haven, Dear John) who really shines at these sorts of emotionally charged yet uplifting stories. Instead, directed by Richard LaGravenese who doesn't have much experience with feature length romance, ""PS I Love You"" doesn't really have a strong identity. Watch it for the story, not for the presentation.One thing I definitely could have done without is the presence of Lisa Kudrow recycling her typecast role: a ditzy, 2-dimensional airhead with a bit of a mean streak, probably intended to make her edgy. Set against the excellent calibre of Hilary Swank and Kathy Bates (both of whom play deep, emotionally complex characters), Lisa Kudrow's ""Phoebe from Friends"" character is way out of place and unnecessary. Her bizarre speech about how she's entitled to objectify men because they objectify her is way, way, wayy out of left field and should have ended up on the cutting room floor.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: P.S. I Love You,"P.S. I Love You is a no-brainer for it to be released this Valentine's Day here, though the challenge of course will be putting couples into seats. Nonetheless everyone's in need for some form of love story, and this will likely fit the bill, although the story's as clich√© as love stories can be, and it's not exactly new material for the screen, given that there's a Thai movie called ""The Letter"" (Jod Mai Rak) which likely had took a leaf from the source material, the novel P.S. I Love You written by Cecelia Ahern.Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hilary Swank) Kennedy are a yuppie couple trying to find their footing in their married life - you know, the usual disapproval from their respective in-laws, Gerry's eagerness to have children, and Holly's perpetually sense of loss in her career, not knowing exactly what to do. We spend the first 10 minutes of the movie listening to typical couple bickering, before all of a sudden, Gerry bites the dust. Yes, you might think that given such a development, it's highly unsuitable as a Valentine's Day movie, but I'd say not to count your chickens first. Thankfully it doesn't dive into what Asian romances do - which is an extended hospital sequence with plenty of scenes to milk those tears out of your ducts - he goes, and that's it.But of course Gerard Butler's name is not on the marquee for nothing, and he's not gonna earn that paycheck so easily. In Shattered which was shown few weeks back, Pierce Brosnan had to opportunity to flex his natural Irish accent. Here, it's Butler's turn, and that probably fluttered the hearts of many females in the audience from the audible sighs of falling in love with that, a great departure from his yowling and screaming for blood in 300 which he is now synonymous with. As the story goes, his Gerry finally comes out with concrete plans, one that is to continue the romance and to help his wife tide through his loss, through letters, instructions and the likes, nothing short of what Keanu Reeves did with Sandra Bullock in The Lake House, although that one had a time sensitive element involved.I've always likened Hilary Swank to tough cookie roles, and Million Dollar Baby helped cement that fact. So to see her here, as a leading lady in a romantic movie, really took some time to get used to. Not to say that's she not pretty enough, but those biceps really complemented Butler's. If there's a weakness in the casting, I'm afraid to say that she's quite miscast because the role calls for a sense of vulnerability, and the inability to move on, and dwelling in one's loss. Hilary Swank doesn't project that, and unfortunately I thought that she could have picked herself up at any one point early in the film.For the most parts, the narrative replays and recounts the love life between Gerry and Holly, taking us to places where their romance started and blossomed, with a host of characters on the side, such as Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon being her great girlfriends, hunters on the side with Harry Connick Jr. and Jeffrey Dean Morgan the potential suitors, and of course, Kathy Bates being the mother. You can't deny though that there are some truths about relationships being communicated throughout, and those in reality are the gems the movie provides, and make great conversational pieces after the movie to discuss with your loved one. There's a nice, touching element of a surprise to it all too, though one can probably see it coming a mile away.There are definitely some flaws in the movie pertaining to coincidences of events, but hey, falling in love itself does take some believing in the flawed cosmic logic of the heart. While it's not a great romance movie, you'll probably be floored by the little thoughts that go a long way, and the transient notion of course to appreciate every moment with your loved one, and not wait for things to happen for the worse, to start reminiscing the loss.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
one of the most beautiful stories of love and life of this era,"wow. this movie was incredible. while i love chick flicks as light-hearted entertainment, never has one made it (aside from love actually) to be amongst my favorite movies. the script for PS i love you has you laughing and crying throughout the whole two hours, you never really know what emotion is going to hit you by the end of a scene. i'm also a great fan of Gerard butler's and was touched by his portrayal of Gerry. he created a man that you miss when the film comes to an end. a far different character from his previous darker leading roles. and Hilary as well as the rest of the cast was perfectly chosen for their roles. don't waste your money renting this movie, just go out and buy it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
PS indeed,"No pun intended - I struggled or rather resisted for a long time to watch this. I remember that I was told by females especially that this movie is soooo good I had to watch it. I would not say that I am resistant to romantic comedies, but it just sounded like something I would not really enjoy watching. And yet, the time came and I finally came around to it. And I have to admit, it is quite good.Which has to do with the actors involved as much as the script ... maybe even more so. Whatever you may think of certain things and the story itself ... you can't fault the actors involved in it. Hillary Swank is amazing ... and her role or rather acting in this is showcasing it. I can't imagine anyone not feeling for her ... but it is the whole cast that is able to reel us in .. to make even the most insane or rather sad moments, cliche moments work ... because the movie is on the brink of completely failing at times ... yet it never does!PS: try to listen to people more ... that was more for me. Also live and enjoy the things you like ... do not let others tell you or shame you for things you do, if it does not concern or affect others negatively ...",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awesome!,"Man i Came into this with low expectations at best and i loved it. Sometimes i wonder how jaded we all are i never see good romantic stories, with decent ratings anymore but to me who has read the book i loved this take on the story and Gerard Butler was great! Honestly anyone who has a drop of romanticism in there veins, this movie IS FOR YOU! Hillary swanks was also very good in it. At first i could not picture her in this role but gosh was i proved wrong what a great performance. I thought the way the characters were portrayed and there interactions were also very good. Also it was about time that James Masterson got a movie role the guy is a great actor i think it was about time. Anyways folks i recommend this its a very good way to spend your Friday or Saturday night!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Truly awful..,"I was so disappointed with this movie - although the book wasn't Shakepheare I thought it was a tender, funny, touching tale and looked forward to the movie. But it was just wrong, wrong, wrong..surely these days we no longer need an American star to attract audiences (and don't get me started on the Other Boleyn Girl)but Hilary Swank was just not right for this part - her talent is considerable but she lacked charm and grace in this movie - all the things that made Holly so endearing in the book. I thought it was overlong, too wordy and too disjointed. The performances looked forced (except Kathy Bates) - Hollys friends were just annoying and Gerald Butler didn't come over as someone whose demise would destroy you - he was just a cartoon jolly Irishman with a song in his heart and a tear in his eye! Avoid at all costs - it'll put you off letter writing and guiness for life!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I prefer Hilary and Harry,"I think Hilary Swank and Harry Connick Jr. make a better on-screen couple than Hilary & Gerard and Hilary & Jeffrey. Their chemistry is so sweet and funny. Harry makes me laugh with his geeky acting and somehow Hilary acts as comedic as Harry every time they have scene together. They should do a romantic comedy movie together as a couple. Lisa Kudrow is always hilarious, gotta love her! I also love Hilary's wardrobe in the movie. So chic in a retro style kind a way. What else do I like? Hilary & Gerard's apartment. So homey and looks fun to live in. She is not satisfied with their apartment? In my country (Indonesia), their place is considered one fancy place.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Slow burner,"USER REVIEWADDITIONI am not a fan of films with 'ghosts' and I was going to give up with this after 20 minutes but the story actually sucked me in. I stayed with it and it turned out to be a nice story (although what Gerry did I thought was quite unfair). However it showed us what true love can do to you and his intentions were good. Nice characters, some great music and even a visit to Ireland. Stay with it you will enjoy it. Slow start but it gets better.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"P.S. I love you...not so much you, you, or you.","I loved and hated this movie all at the same time. I thought it was cute but too sappy. I thought the acting was good, I liked the actors but I hated the characters. The only characters I liked were Gerard Butler's and Hilary Swank's. I absolutely love Hilary Swank. She is my favorite actress and I try to see all of her movies because they are always amazing. I am glad she did this movie because I like seeing her in different types of roles but this wasn't the best movie she was in. I liked the plot but I didn't like Hilary Swank's strange and pointless romances in the movie. I felt the mourning period of her late husband was rushed and disrespected by the other characters, this made me dislike them and they ruined the movie for me. I did love the idea of the plot, I loved Swank and Butler's relationship in the movie, I felt their chemistry. Gerard Butler is a great actor. I loved his character. I wish he was real! I also thought that the flashback's were done very well. It was a well made movie. But it had a lot of potential to be even better.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cup half full? I think not,"Solid movie and no doubt a real tear jerker. However I did notice one issue in the scene when Holly (Hillary Spank) sees William (Geoffrey Morgan) naked for the first time. She was pouring Jameson into a glass and was shocked to see his buttocks in the bedroom. If you watch carefully the glass of Jameson goes from 1/4 full to empty, to 1/4 full and then out of nowhere it's completely full to the brim.I couldn't believe my eyes! A movie with this high of a budget shouldn't be making novice mistakes such as this. I turned it off.I sure hope she finds her husband in the end.Great movie, but little things like this really bring it down. Completely unacceptable.Regards,

Great Movie,"It has been a long time since a movie has moved me the way that P.S. I Love You did. My daughter enjoyed it as much as my friend did and my daughter is 30 yrs. younger, so its a movie for women of all ages. It is a great chick flick to see and stays with you long after you leave the theater. Just be sure to bring plenty of Kleenex with you. The casting was great. We all loved seeing Denny from Gray's Anatomy (can't remember his real name) and Gerald Butler. Also, we all like Harry Connick Jr. and anytime Kathy Bates is in a movie its good. We also liked Lisa Kudrow and her one-liners. Hilary Swank is also very good in this movie. The men in our lives were glad we went and saw it without them, but I guess there are some men who would enjoy it. I am telling everyone to go and see it and that it is not a waste of money like so many movies are. It is one that we will purchase for our DVD collection. So go and enjoy a movie that will make you cry, have you laughing and leave you with that WOW feeling as you walk out of the show.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Grittier than the fairytale I was expecting,"With the announcement that a sequel was coming for 'P.S. I Love You' I thought I'd better finally get around to seeing the original so that I was ready for it. Just reading the imdb synopsis for this movie makes me sad. There aren't many more somber concepts for a movie than this one. Interestingly I didn't find the actual film anywhere near as sad as I expected to.It's hard to put my finger on exactly why that was the case. I found some of the characters a little hard to get on-board with. Lisa Kudrow's character for example could be downright nasty. I feel the film went more for realistic characters who are flawed, than your usual whimsical characters that typically possess films. I actually respect that they did that even if it was to the detriment of the film.I think I was expecting more of a fairytale for adults type film, and instead I got a more gritty, pragmatic style. I'm okay with that, however if I had to choose I'd probably prefer the fairytale. I'm rarely as ambivalent towards a film as I am towards 'P.S. I Love You'. For me it was a touching story, that I'm glad I saw, however it is unlikely that it will stick around in my mind.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Movie: Awkward, Artificial, Icky; Butler: Charming as Ever","First, let's get this out of the way: Gerard Butler is one of the sexiest men alive. Throughout ""P.S. I Love You"" he maintains his irresistible charm and masculine grace.As for the movie itself, ""P.S. I Love You"" is abysmal. It is, throughout, simply, awkward. Scenes plod without apparent purpose or design. Characters and actors seem to be coming from different films. Lines of dialogue fall flat as suicide jumpers.You don't know whether the filmmaker's goal was to create a heartwarming scene or a gut-wrenching fight. Hillary Swank is especially out of place. I felt she must be doing a film in a studio next door and just visiting the set of this film.I spent the hour after watching it wondering how so many talented people could have made such a lousy movie. The stars are fine. We know these people and we know what they can do: Kathy Bates and Hillary Swank are Oscar winners, for example.The biggest problems are the script and the directing. The script is hollow and incoherent. Not a single believable, consistent character emerges from this muddle. Holly, the lead, (Hillary Swank), is, by turns, depicted as a castrating, frustrated shrew, a nature girl deadhead hippie, and a high-heeled shoe fetishist. Kathy Bathes, the mom, is depicted as hating her son-in-law and railing against her daughter, and then is shown to have done something kindly that goes against everything we were told about her.Not only does the script not make sense, there are scenes that are downright cringe-inducing. Characters that the viewer knows should not be kissing kiss; characters we are supposed to like behave like temperamental, wacko scum. The main premise ¬ñ that a man dictates his wife's life after his death ¬ñ is downright creepy.So, what happened to Richard Lagravenese, who has written great scripts in the past? My best guess: neither he nor anybody else involved has any respect for the potential for excellence in a movie about women and for women, and so they just cut and pasted a series of scenes that they thought would get the ladies to cry and sigh. ""Oh, here we need a kiss. Ladle a kiss in here. Okay, here we need a catfight between girlfriends. One catfight, coming up. Okay, here we need a poignant mother-daughter moment. Let's rewrite a scene from 'Terms of Endearment' and spackle it in here."" Look ¬ñ some people are saying that loving or hating this movie is about the difference between men and women. Don't believe them. ""P.S. I Love You"" is a simply awful movie, and an insult to its intended female audience. If you want to see a good chick flick, there are plenty out there that are as intelligent as anything made for men. Don't tell me that this movie's abysmal quality is the fault of women. Rather, it's the fault of treating women, and art made for women, with complete disrespect.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Such a shame,"I read this wonderful book a few years ago and thought it was fabulous. Both hilariously funny and very sad at the same time. Most of its charm was down to the fact that it was set in Ireland. I thought the film was watchable but was overall disappointing. A major problem I think was that it was that it was set in New York and not r Ireland. A lot of the books charms is that it is set in Ireland and most of the actors were Irish. the characters in the book are Irish and of course the humour is Irish and therefore very funny. The book is definitely far superior to the film, but perhaps I think that because I am Scottish and get the jokes and the humour. Anyone that thinks the film is better than the book has obviously either had a sense of humour bypass or is American! I do hope that Cecelia herself isn't disappointed with the film as I would be if I were her.. I did think it would have been much better if it had been made in Ireland or UK - sorry but its true. Anyway I am going back to reread this book and remind myself how great-it is and how much Hollywood have trashed it to make a substandard film. Such a shame.",,Anonymous,Romance
An excellent display of a mix drama-love story,"One of the best movies to watch if you got yourself the sentimental kind of girlfriend (which at that moment i did). Gets her into your arms immediately (one should only imagine what would come after). But let's get back to the movie.First of all, the end is not predictable. Most movies go for that these days, mostly failing to achieve it tho.As i expected this film to fully deliver, it did. Wonderful charismatic actors -i bet girls would find Gerard's accent pretty appealing - outputting a nice play, sweet lines every now and then, marvelous script. Inovative and romantic idea. One of the best dramas to hit the screens lately.You will be watching a love story with its ups and downs, its passionate moments and its difficult challenges. While not all relationships end this kind of way, its a good suggestion on how to appreciate more what you got(supposing you got anything)while you still got it.

I believe that its one is different and unique, and that's something that makes these movies special. I really liked this movie because of the plot and the interpretations of the cats, especially Hilary Swank who was simply beautiful. I also liked the interpretations of Kathy Bates, Gerard Butler's and Jeffrey Dean Morgan's. I also think that the plot of this romantic movie was really unique and I have never seen a movie like this before and I was really happy about it because it was so unpredictable.Finally I have to tell you that ""P.S.

At Last real entertainment.,"After reading so many good reviews, I was still apprehensive about taking my husband to see the movie P.S. I Love You. I knew the basic story line and the excellent actors to star in it so that was a plus but to my surprise my husband enjoyed it equally as much as I did. We both came out from the experience satisfied that for once it was money well spent and that the days of good movie had not yet ended. What a great movie! We talked about it almost all the way home. It was very hard to hold back from uncontrollable laughter and tears in this movie it was both very funny and very sad at times. Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler are excellent in portraying their roles as Holly and Gerry as are the rest of the characters especially Lisa Kudrow with her added touch of Michele reminiscent of Romy in"" Romy and Micheles Highschool Reunion."" This movie drew people from all age groups young and old and appreciated by most, confirmed by the applauding at the end. There was some human aspect of the movie that all could relate to whether it be a tragic loss, being alone or just striving for a happy existence in everyday life but all lifted with a touch of Irish humour and their way of seeing things. What could have been just another tragic love story was given depth by those who portrayed their roles so well. Colourful characters fitting their equally visually colourful environments.After seeing previous movies of Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler, they are both wonderful actors true chameleons of their art, throwing their selves into any role they take on and this one no exception. If you a looking for a good laugh or a good cry then this will do it for you. I can't remember anywhere in the movie where I lost interest and dozed off. It will keep you amused, pure entertainment!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sometimes there's only one thing left to say: Great Movie!,"When I first saw the trailer for P.S. I Love You, I was so thrown off and knew that I did not want to see this movie, it looked so typical and like it was an over blown chick flick. But I heard some great things about the film and decided to just wait for the rental, I got it on Tuesday and watched it today, I have to say that I am so glad I gave this movie a chance, it was such a pleasure to watch. It had great actors and a very touching story, something that really hasn't been done before. What happens when you have to start your life all over again without the love of your life? How scary is it? I think the reason I love this film is that everyone could relate to it, wither you've been: widowed, divorced, left by a relative or friend, or had a bad break up, this movie expresses all the emotions and hard times that you'll go through, but to remember that it's OK to live again.Holly had a wonderful husband, Gerry, even though they fought quite a bit, he was the one love of her life, and due to a brain tumor, he was taken so quickly from her. At the young age of 30, she has to rediscover what it is to go on without him, but to her surprise, she receives letters from Gerry that he wrote to her before he passed away. Leading her to have the courage and strength to do what she didn't think she could do before, and most of all love and live again.Hilary Swank and Gerald Butler have this dead on chemistry that makes the film work so well. Gerry's letters to Holly were so touching, I usually hate the sappy stuff, but this was just a sweet movie that will touch anyone's heart and also make them laugh at the same time. Kathy Bate's speech at the end with Hilary Swank was so true about how hard it is after being alone and having to learn to live again, it's a strange feeling, it's almost like learning to breathe again. P.S. I Love You is a great movie, I do recommend it, it's just a decent movie that is more than worth your time, it doesn't over kill on anything, just makes you feel good.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad film,"I bought this film for my girlfriend as like most women she loves sentimental films about romance and from some other reviews I saw, thought that I might be able to handle watching this film with her. Well to any other blokes out there thinking the same as me, trust me when I tell you that you should stay as far away from this film as is humanly possible!!! Ill admit that I am not finding it difficult putting into words just how dreadful this ""Romcom"" actually is. The actors and actresses in this movie ,apart from Lisa Kudrow & Kathy Bates, really should know better than to subject an audience to such MISERY (maybe a curse was put on the film seeing as Kathy Bates got such a paltry role.) The Irish accents are just painful to listen to as is usually the case. The plot seems to have been mauled to death by a pitbull, its as if the director was aiming for some grand romantic tragedy and ended up with a tragic flop. There is no spark between our two love birds at the start of the film and the male lead will hopefully have ended is acting career as I for one would never want to watch such pitiful acting again. Some reviewers have been kind and said that if the film were in the hands of another director, then this film could have been good but i personally don't believe this to be the case as the only thing right and good about this film is the when we finally reach the end. At 2 hours this film is a marathon which i didn't want to finish. If you do still decide to buy this film after reading this review please seek help as you will need it after watching this film.Ps.

If i could replicate this, i.e. ever have this opportunity when my time comes, I'd be so happy (do it for my son, and if i ever got married again, my husband)For some reason, watching it again last night (it just came on Film4) I could not reconcile with the misery that i felt, at the end. when the widow (played brilliantly) suddenly announced that 'He's no longer with me'¬Ö¬Ö.

A Nice Little Surprise Film,"Marketing P.S. I LOVE YOU was a hit/miss situation. The general trailer and the billboards seem to set the audience up for a sappy tearjerker. But happily what happens in this film is not the expected 'widowed person communicating with the dead love out of failure to get on with life' tale, but instead a look into the importance of friendship, family, and adjusting to the incomparable loss. Credit the original novel by Cecelia Ahern as adapted for the screen by Steven Rogers writer/director Richard LaGravenese for making what so easily have been a sappy, maudlin, whining tale into a touching one of human emotions with a sense of reality mixed with a mildly implausible situation, and a series of character studies that emphasize the importance of support in the time of grief.Holly (Hilary Swank) and Gerry (Gerard Butler) Kennedy are a married couple with goals and frustrations and a huge dollop of passionate love, surrounded by friends and family. The tragedy happens just as the movie starts: Gerry has died of a brain tumor leaving the copeless Holly alone with her memories and self-inflicted regrets. But Gerry, knowing he was a terminal patient, devised his own plan to help Holly through that first year of grief: he left letters in various forms and places, advising Holly how to learn about his family and how to get on with life. Holly's mother (Kathy Bates) owns a bar and has supported her little family since Holly's father deserted his family years ago. In the bar is another injured soul named Daniel (Harry Connick Jr.) who fancies Holly but realizes she is far from ready to think about dating. Holly's friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) accompany Holly to Gerry's pre-planned trip to his home in Ireland to meet the in-laws Holly never knew. While in Ireland Holly reminisces on the magic of first meeting Gerry, meets Gerry's parents as well as Gerry's best friend William (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and through it all manages to appreciate the gift of PS I Love You letters and reminders Gerry has left for her. And she ultimately finds closure to her loss.The cast is strong and makes these at times strained characters into lovable people: Hilary Swank has made a successful entrance into the feminine lead role and is balanced to perfection by Butler, Morgan, Connick, Bates, Kudrow and Gershon. They make the implausible plausible and deliver a love story that goes beyond the level of superficial to join the ranks of warm and tender memorable slices of life. It is surprisingly good!

P.S. I want a refund,"This movie was physically painful to watch; I was compelled to leave the theater before the opening credits were complete. After watching the trailer, the very first time, I was supremely confident when I informed my significant other this movie would blow; however she asked nicely, so not only did I agree to sit through this borefest, I paid good money to do so. Although my wife absolutely loves this genre, even she tapped-out after only watching 30 minutes of this train wreck.With the exception of a few beautifully filmed scenes of Ireland's countryside, this film has zero redeeming qualities. The overall production would have been much better had it been 115 minutes shorter. Although classified as a love story, there is no love and there is no story. There is also absolutely no chemistry between the two main characters, Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler. Every female feminist and traditionalist who dares to watch this movie should be both appalled and embarrassed by Swank's character's pathetic behavior. There is nothing romantic about this film, there is nothing comedic about this film. The acting by the entire cast is average at best. Hilary was miscast for this part; she doesn't look comfortable in any scene; she is neither funny nor believable at any level. Producers should have obtained the services of a comedian for Holly's character. Lisa Kudrow looks tired and ragged and she also brings the same facial expressions, voice and mannerisms from her ""Friends'"" character, Phoebe. What is the point of Harry Connick, Jr.'s part? The ending of this film was perfect, just as meaningless and uneventful as the rest of the movie.If you possess an IQ above 60 or you enjoy romantic comedies, do yourself a favor and don't see this movie. Also, when released, be sure not to rent this movie or buy the DVD. It will be the best four hours of your life you did not waste. This film should have never been funded or produced; it is one of the worst movies I have seen in the past year. I just want a refund.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"If only every man can care sooooo much for his lady, with her and without her!","To be very frank, I did hear about this movie quite a lot in my college days, with almost all the girls going gaga about the story and the portrayal of the hero's thoughtfulness. I haven't read the novel but I guess my tryst with this tale had to wait until 2014. I am absolutely thrilled to see a love story being played with such humor surrounding it. Gerard Butler plays the Irishman with natural ease and Hillary Swank follows up on her part by being that girl in love, hung over by the death of her husband and yet lively enough to do everything that he asks of her from the afterlife. Planning ahead for all the letters being sent at the right time and how they are encountered seems a little too much drama but ohh well it was very believable and doable too.. all it needed was the feeling of caring for someone beyond the time when they can possibly care for you. Simple words to read but not so simple to adapt in reality. The open mindedness of Hillary's character is very appreciably put forward and she is willing to go follow the path of mutual happiness that her deceased husband has planned for her. Best scene... The first walk together! Priceless!!!",,Anonymous,Romance

No genre can describe this silly little get up, with an unbelievable plotline - a guy dying of a brain tumour had time to organise his widow's love life?- yeah, I get the ghostly metaphor for undying love, pun intended. Not that we get to see that, of course not! How would they get around the practicalities involved to be remotely convincing? And the central role is an unfortunate bit of casting, Swank definitely earned those Oscars, but here she just kind of cruises along without much conviction. Maybe she felt the silliness all along.
There's a lot of cliche stuff here too, Kudrow's character perhaps the greatest of all. But Bates, Butler and especially Connick put in absolutely stunning turns in their roles each. Harry Connick is especially good, he does the cynical burnt in love turn with understated brilliance. He hasn't done much in Hollywood and he should have. He has incredible screen presence.
So six stars, two each for Bates, Butler and Connick. Definitely worth watching for these three.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Movie Based on Awful Book,"THE BAD NEWS: After I finished reading Cecilia Ahern's novel ""P.S. I Love You"", I was disappointed. The story was a great idea, the perfect chick-lit topic. Unfortunately, Ahern didn't manage to pull off the charming, touching and very human story she intended. The main character, Holly Kennedy, ended up a pathetic whiner and by the end of the book I was thinking ""just get over it already!!!"".THE GOOD NEWS: I can count on one hand the similarities between the novel and the film. The screenwriters (Ahern was, thankfully, not one of them) took the fresh, interesting idea and ran with it. Other than names and basic plot points, the film is totally different than the book. The characters are sympathetic, Holly is charming and funny - someone us girls would hang out with. Even the setting is different (book: Ireland, film: New York City.) When a friend dragged me to the movie (yes, she had to drag me - after that awful book, I had no desire to waste 2 hours on the movie), I was not hopeful. Five minutes into the movie I was hooked. I loved it.Cheers to author Cecilia Ahern for her great idea... and for not participating as a screenwriter - she did us all a favor there.See this movie, you'll love it!!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
touching,"i found this romantic drama to be a pleasant surprise.it's well written,with good dialogue.the acting,especially from the principles,Hilary Swank,and Gerard Butler is terrific.the movie is very touching and tender,without being depressing,and there are even some humorous moments.i also found it authentic for the most part.there are a few things i didn't like.one of them was Lisa Kudro's character.i found her vulgar and crude,and whenever she was on screen,she changed the tenor of the movie,not in a good way.there were also a few scenes which i thought cheapened thew movie a bit.you'll know what i mean if you watch the movie.i also didn't buy the friendship between Holly(Swank) and that of Kudro's and Gina Gershon's characters.they just seemed out of place to me.i think it is a case of miscasting.despite the problems with the the movie,i still found it worth watching.i give P.S.

Touching story,"I have to confess that I cried all the time during this movie, because the story is very touching and moving. It is also ironic in many parts, so that it is enjoyable to watch it, although it is about some important themes such as love, death, lost, acceptation, friendship and resistance.
I didn't like very much the protagonists, they are not my favourite actors. Maybe the movie could have been better with other actors, but this is only my personal opinion.
In conclusion it is a nice movie, but be ready with the hankies!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Unique story that combines love, comedy and grief.",When I first saw this film on TV I had just lost my husband to cancer. I absorbed this film. I ran out and bought the DVD and played it over and over. I don't know why it was panned. It's a unique love story. The comic timing keeps the film from becoming maudlin and sad.

A Cute Romantic Movie,"1 July 2008. An interesting premise though not quite as smooth and flowing as possible. The humor and serious drama seem to flow unevenly in this romance drama of a widow receiving periodic letters or messages from her dead husband. There is a feeling of forced as well as time lags in the plot that make the movie ebb and flow. Somewhat different in its plot script device, the movie moves forward with its entertainment, different cultures, and sometimes blunt character intentions. Overall, this movie doesn't quite have the gem star quality of Ghost (1990) or even the striking intensity of Heaven Can Wait (1978). Seven out of Ten Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than the book. It's a must watch for true lovers.,"I had read the book quite a while ago. But it didn't make me cry that much I needed. I was also fantasizing about Gerry to be Ashton Kutcher and Holly being Lindsay Lohan.When I came to know that Gerrard and Hillary were selected as the main characters, I was happy!! And I also found it a little funny because their nicknames are just as the characters do have.The first scene of the movie was cool. ""We fight we break up, We kiss we make up"". I loved the movie right then and there.The most beautiful part of the movie was there shot on Wicklow National Mountains Park. Their first kiss was amazing. Also the scene when Holly cries in her mom's arms is quite touchy and I was in tears.After some days I bought the DVD and I swear I've seen the movie more than 10 times.

Likable Hilary Swank,"Holly (Hilary Swank) is in a tumultuous relationship with her husband Gerry (Gerard Butler). Holly is devastated when Gerry dies from a brain tumor. Before he died, he sends her a message on her 30th birthday. He would send her a series of letters leading her to have adventures and re-engaging her to the world.I'm not sure I can root for Swank-Butler relationship. The letters are creepy to say the least. And Butler is smirky even when he's dead and we can only hear him. Swank is ill suited for rom-coms struggling hard to be cute. Harry Connick Jr. is probably better as the dead husband. At least he wouldn't be as creepy as the voice from the afterlife. Lisa Kudrow does some funny bits as a single girl always out on the hunt. This is a gimmicky movie that gets by mostly due to the likable Hilary Swank. It's meant to be a tearjerker, but the main message is so clich√©. No tears were shed for this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

P.S. I Love You,"Scots-born Gerard Butler (""Gerry"") sports an American accent and comes from Ireland so maybe this isn't going to be the most plausible rom-com? He has a fiery but loving relationship with his wife ""Holly"" (Hilary Swank) who can't decide if she wants kids or not. Sadly, his active role in the film is cut short and she is left to deal with the consequences of widowhood. She's not alone on her new journey, though. ""Gerry"" had anticipated her predicament and left some letters to help her get through the grief and set off on a new path - however reluctantly she might want one. At first it's a cake for her birthday then as more arrive we start to appreciate more about how they met and fell in love. Some disastrous karaoke, temper tantrums and his downright hostile relationship with her mother ""Patricia"" (Kathy Bates). A trip to Ireland helps her to recalibrate though, and a meeting with local musician ""William"" (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) makes he realise that her life has plenty of legs in it yet. At home, lifelong friend ""Daniel"" (Harry Connick Jr.) presses his suit and makes her think even more about her future. Can she find love again? Connick is on decent form as is Bates, but the remainder of this is just a bit too sentimental for mea and the humour doesn't land often enough. There's little by way of chemistry on display and though the letter-writing concept is quite original, the execution becomes just a bit too episodic and Butler tries too hard to make this work. It's perfectly watchable, but is too workmanlike to be memorable.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Beautiful movie,"I only watched this movie based on a friends recommendation. I had never heard of it, and was pretty hesitant because the title is way too corny. But, I watched it and I loved it! It is pleasantly surprising.This movie had everything, I would be laughing one minute, crying the next, all within one scene. Some standout scenes for me were the flashback karaoke scene (and of course the aftermath) and the tear-jerking scene in which Holly listens to Gerry's voice-mail message over and over. Unlike most romantic movies, the ending wasn't frustratingly cheesy. It was sweet and believable.'Love you till the end' by Irish/English band The Pogues was a perfect choice for the soundtrack.

Alternative review,"It's easy enough to ready the synopsis to get a grasp of what this film is about, but what is seriously ignored by the audience for this film is the lessons offered through the script.Each scene offers a piece of life advice, offering a new perspective of how to handle situations. This film (to an extent) is a realistic romcom, there is no happy love story ending with the one made for the main character, Holly.So many lines are golden and I cannot stress how much this is my favourite film.

Irish don't say ¬´ Baby ¬ª,"Oh so clich√©d, oh so contrived, oh so predictable. We've seen it all a hundred times before.The film begins with our ""loving"" couple having a raucous, protracted argument; the vehicle chosen (curiously) by the director to convey the depth and sincerity of their relationship, and during which, on several occasions our Irishman calls his wife ""baby"". Irishmen don't say ""baby"". This unconvincing beginning sets the tone for the rest of the film.What a disappointment; and from the same writer/director and leading lady who gave us the excellent Freedom Writers. What happened here?Hilary Swank looks uncomfortably miscast in this role, she turns in a flat, mediocre performance, and there is a palpable lack of chemistry between her and her on-screen husband Gerard Butler. They really are the most unlikely couple. Added to which, neither of the two supposedly Irish men (Gerard Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan) can manage a proper Irish accent.The script is weak and pretentious and the storyline lacks authenticity. Billed as a romantic comedy, it is neither romantic nor funny. It simply does not work.This film is coated with a wafer thin veneer of pathos, humour and romanticism; a veneer which cracks under the slightest examination to reveal the emptiness within.If there were a category for ""cringe"" value it would score 10, but for spectator value it just scrapes a 2.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pretty good movie...!,Concept is known to me but it's pretty good movie to watch with your beloved. I like the actress no doubt as she literally very sexy. Recommend if you like romance movies.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Absolute Tear-Jerker for the hardest of people.,"I am usually not a fan of ""chick flicks"" and I absolutely avoid anything lumped under the category of ""rom-com"". But this movie defies all odds. I first watched a little of PS I LOVE you when it aired on TV, and got completely sucked in. Now, I cry every.single.time I watch it, and it's been quite a few times. May I also note this is NOT a romantic comedy, despite what it's categorised under. There are a few comic relief moments, but even those are usually ""smile through tears"" moments.I think this movie works so well because of how well the actors played their parts. Hilary Swank! Wow! As the grieving widow Holly, she is absolutely fantastic. Her grief was so real, every time she cried, I cried. And it wasn't constant over the top ""I'm so distraught"" moments, it was moments of silent tears leaking out of her eyes as the pain of never seeing her husband again and missing him so much, shatter her heart over and over again. And with minimal expression, you can see this in her face. And then when the letters start arriving and she reflects on their past life together, and all around her friends and family and the world are moving on with life, and she is stuck, consumed in grief feeling so alone. In one scene she actually does run to her mother in hysterics, unable to breath and gasping how alone she is. It was truly heart-breaking, as it's the one moment she actually cracks and all the emotions just come tumbling down on her. I don't think anyone could have played this role as well as Hilary Swank did. She made her character so realistic and believable. Gerard Butler who plays the husband Gerry also does a pretty good job as the sexy Irish man who loves his wife so so very much, and out of his irrevocable love for her, wants to make sure his wife moves on with her life after he is gone. You truly invest in their relationship, presented to us by the letters, ghost memories and flashback scenes to how Holly and Gerry first met. And made stronger of course by how powerfully Holly grieves the loss of Gerry.Cathy Bates also does an astounding job as the tough, yet loving mother, who even though she has been through her own pain in the past, still stands as a rock for Holly. I also really enjoyed Lisa Kudrow who plays the funny and loyal friend to Holly. The only actor who annoyed me was Harry Connick Jr, or more so his character. He had a part to play in the story I suppose, but most of the time I wish he wasn't there, as some awkward and not funny scenes could have been avoided.All in all, I recommend giving this movie a go. There has been numerous negative reviews that you should avoid and just watch the movie and make your own judgement. From someone who loves her slasher and thriller films, and thought the popular sob-fest love story The Notebook was corny and unimpressive, P.S I Love You left me pleasantly surprised after the first of many viewings, and always with tear stained cheeks.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

P.S. It's Rubbish!,"Let me get this straight first, I had absolutely no desire whatsoever to see this movie, in fact had a friend not literally forced me to go with her I would no doubt have lived my days quite happily and never have had to endure this movie! The trailer looked pretty stupid, and the whole plot idea just sounded more creepy than anything else. But still this is all irrelevant, I went into the cinema today with my box of popcorn and prepared myself for a poor movie. Now you know every so often you sit and watch a movie you expect to be horrendous and come out pleasantly surprised, movie such as Alvin and the Chipmunks, well P.S. I love You is one of those movies that you go in expecting to dislike and come out absolutely hating. Now some of you will point out this got a 4/10 rating, well this has got that rating based partially on someone elses view, most namely a girls. You see in my eyes I would give this a 2/10 rating, but my friend liked this a hell of a lot more than I did, and because I am a fair person I decided this is a movie aimed at women, not me. Anyway P.S. I Love You is an overlong, over-schmaltzy, pretty unfunny, pretty well acted, predictable piece of trash that is just so eye gougingly annoying after a while you cannot help but get tired of it come the final hour. Hilary Swank does her very best, and she has a few scenes that are absolutely perfect, but Gerard Butler dons one of the worst accents in a long time and the movie takes a long time to get to an ending that was way too predictable in the first place. The other huge problem is that sometimes the comedy side falls very flat, in fact its not only unbelievable a widow would let some man crack jokes at her dead husband as he seems to do, but also seemingly the movie verges on insulting to a lot of widows out there.So let me go into the performances with a little more depth. Hilary Swank as I've said is very good, sure the script lets her down, but she is such a good actress anyway that she seems to make the material work. Whenever it gets to the emotional stuff, or the more powerful stuff where she is dealing with being a widow, Swank delivers a killer of a performance. Just watch the karaoke scene, sure its cheesy as a result of the script, but if you watch Swank's face you can see she is acting her socks off and she's delivering a very good performance. A shame her performance in some of the flashbacks, especially the meeting sequence with Gerry, just seems poorly executed and leave Swank looking a bit silly more than anything else. Gerard Butler unfortunately just comes out of this movie looking a bit foolish. Sure he's a decent actor, and he seems a nice guy, but he cannot pull off an Irish accent for the life of him! He does decently in some scenes, in fact the smaller scenes work very well, but when he shouts and at the beginning, his accent just seems absurd and too silly for you to take the character seriously. Also sometimes you question why his character was ever with Swank's in the first place, she seems so unlikable at times and almost a bully towards him, so the relationship never seems to work. Luckily Lisa Kudrow is on hand to steal the movie and give the movie the comedic oomph that it needs. Unfortunately she's on screen all too briefly leaving the movie trying to find something funny way too often. Kathy Bates unfortunately is given nothing to do until five minutes towards the end where she delivers an extremely powerful sequence, but up until then she seems wasted. By far the worst though is Harry Connick Jr, a character that is supposed to be likable but just seems downright rude, in fact if I was Hilary Swank I'd have punched him within seconds of meeting him!The movies major problem has to be the pacing and the length. This movie is simply way too long! There are so many irrelevant scenes, what the hell the point was in seeing how they met is beyond me, but it took up twenty more minutes! So much could be cut and by cutting it the movie might have at least passed average. Instead the movie droned endlessly on leaving you sick and tired with the characters and praying something exciting happens soon, it doesn't so before you see this movie don't expect anything even remotely like a thrill. The movie also aims to be sweet and tries to make you cry, it just makes you roll your eyes and makes you feel closer to depressed than anything else. The final huge flaw of the film just has to be the premise of thing. I have never read, nor ever intend to read the book this is based on. I just don't get how this is supposed to be a pleasant movie. This is about a grieving widow who receives messages from her dead husband, some people think its a sweet idea I just found it a poor way for the woman to get over her loss.P.S. I Love You is a chick flick firmly aimed at people who love that genre, but for me this was too full of clich√©s and just too poorly made. This movie does have a bit of potential and at Swank seems to be trying to make this a good movie, but the movie is way too long and the storyline just too boring and unoriginal for the audience to care.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Combination Of Dreadfully Boring And Sugary Sweet,"The opening scenes of this movie portray a passionate and obviously comic argument between Holly and Gerry (Hilary Swank and Gerald Butler.) For a couple of minutes, the argument was humorous. It quickly grew old, but unfortunately it went on and on for about ten minutes. By that time I already had a bad taste in my mouth from this movie that never really went away. Yes - it's the proverbial ""chick flick,"" so perhaps I shouldn't have expected to really like it, but romantic comedies can still be fun - chick flick or not. In this case, however, the humour seemed to be forced and artificial - everyone seemed to be trying to hard to be funny; it wasn't coming across as natural. Combined with a rather lifeless performance from Swank as well as the ridiculous character of Denise (Lisa Kudrow) - surely one of the dumbest ""serious"" characters ever to appear in a movie - the whole thing fell apart rather quickly. It was at best a weak romantic comedy, with actors who didn't really seem to click and characters who didn't appeal to me particularly. The one exception might have been Daniel. I felt sorry for him when he ended up stuck in the middle of Holly's problem of not being able to let go of Gerry. Gerry (her husband) had died of a brain tumour, but before he died he had put together a plan to help her move on and begin to enjoy her life again: a series of letters and gifts being delivered to her from him, each of which pushed her a little farther along the path to healing. This just struck me as a generally lifeless movie that accomplished very little in the end, although I did appreciate one bit of philosophy found within: ""life is a great and short and terrible thing and none of us are going to get out of it alive."" I'm a minister. I think I might be able to make use of that someday. Aside from that, though, there was precious little here that interested me. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Soft centred stuff,Despite a couple of really bad attempts at an Irish accent this is a fair film that never really gets going. The first half hour drags by and before you get too into it the film wraps up.Hillary Swank is on top form as Holly as she tries to get over the loss of her husband played by Gerard Butler and is well supported by Lisa Kudrow who gets all the best lines.It is a soppy film and there isn't really much for guys to enjoy but they aren't really the target audience. This film is a good old fashioned weepy and once the story gets going the tissues become as needed as the popcorn.Not a film for everyone (as I think the box office takings showed) but it is well worth watching as the cast try to bring the original novel by Cecelia Ahern to the big screen.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not So Heavy Thinking in My Fort,"Greetings again from the darkness. Richard LaGravenese is a very talented writer and director. His credits include ""Freedom Writers"" (also with Hilary Swank), ""Paris, je t'aime"", and the documentary ""A Decade Under the Influence"" (about the impact of 70's films). He also wrote the terrific story for ""The Fisher King"" (wrongly forgotten). Here he takes on Cecilia Ahern's novel and his first real chick flick.The premise for this one is very intriguing and with Gerard Butler (so great in ""300"") in a leading role, my expectations were pretty high. The good news is that Butler delivers the goods. He is remarkably charming and likable and proves to have a flair for quick wit and a boyish smile. Two other male actors deserve mention. Harry Connick, jr delivers his best performance since ""Little Man Tate"". Connick is usually so pompous on screen that he has become somewhat of a caricature. In the film, he is mildly afflicted with say-what-you're-thinking-aloud syndrome and has some of the best scenes in the film. Also, Jeffrey Dean Morgan (slow dying Denny from ""Grey's Anatomy"") is pretty believable as Butler's oh-so-charming best friend and replacement.The bad news: for this film to work, we need to understand Butler's adoration of Hilary Swank. Maybe the best way for me to describe this is to say that Lisa Kudrow is not the most annoying woman in this film ... Hilary Swank is. Why did this great guy stick for 9 years with this ungrateful, narcissistic, loud, hateful, demeaning woman? Swank's character needed to be somewhat likable, not just aware that she loved him AFTER he's dead. The ""true love bond"" was just not on display, so it just doesn't work.I score the film so high (6) only in deference to director LaGravenese, Mr. Butler, music from the Pogues and a chick flick premise that could and should have delivered. At least it offered my mind the opportunity to re-write scenes and recast the lead with someone who I wouldn't hope would get tossed off the roof.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Understated.,"When I decided against watching Atonement again and for this movie I bought myself a coffee in case I needed it to keep me from wasting my money but when the film started I did not resort to it at all, instead I found myself needing it to restore body fluid lost as a result of the flawless storyline. The start of the film really captured the picture of this madly in-love married couple. It reflected how people can be at each other's throats but really, they just want to do whatever it takes to make each other happy. The flashbacks of Gerry and Holly's relationship made the viewer realise that their love was extraordinary and felt the pang of heartache for her loss. Swank's performance was exceptional, in fact all the actors contributed to the heart wrenching and warming moments of the movie except maybe Jefferey Dean Morgan's. Hmmm. I think it was his flawed accent that ruined his performance. I think the trailer under states the film and if you're looking for a good cry. Watch it. I did... 3 times. Oh yeah and its heaps better than Atonement. The love in Atonement seemed not as genuine as PS' and seemed just a bit exaggerated.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

for a good cry,"I truly enjoyed watching this movie. I will say if you have a heart and need a good cry...I recommend seeing this movie. And even men can relate to this movie, even if they think it's a chick flick. It reminds you that love is something amazing and should never be forgotten or lost. And that life will go on even after loved ones are gone. I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD for I will be getting it.I will not give any details away of this movie, but I do recommend tissue and don't wear any make-up if you can help it! Hillary Swank and Gerry Butler are amazing together. Harry Connick Jr. played his part well. and What can I say about Jeffrey Dean Morgan except can I keep you. Will you sing a song for me please and rescue me. That man is hot...but so is Gerry!!! Something about the accent ladies, it can drive you crazy. Sorry men.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Cult Classic Destined for Classic,"For those who shy away from sentimental romantic comedies with a pinch of schmaltz, this is not for you. You will need a heart to accompany your popcorn. Based on DVD sales, online rentals, personal conversations I've overheard at coffee shops and mentions on online dating sights ... this precious gem has garnered a loyal cult following. Time will tell whether ""cult"" will eventually be removed and it graduates into the ""classic"" category.""P.S. I Love You"" refers to the sign-off the recently deceased Gerry uses (Gerard Butler) when writing a series of love letters to his wife Holly (Swank), relatively speaking, from the grave. (That's where the spoiler alert comes in). The opening scene treats us to crackling dialogue between the two loving spouses in the form of playful fighting, rapier barbs flung rapid-fire at each other containing equal bits of tease and biting truths. In other words ... marriage. It's a genuine delight to see these two fine actors in action. The salvos feel so pure and real it recalls similar in-fighting from another classic film you may have heard of, ""It Happened One Night,"" and the snappy duels between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert.Indeed, the film pays direct homage to the romantic classics of yore, Holly a film buff watching Bette Davis films and singing aloud to the Judy Garland torch song ""The Man That Got Away.""Back to the letters. You see, shortly after the introductory 'love fight' comes a jump cut to rival all jump cuts. Gerry's funeral. Here we meet Holly's friends, family and allies. Holly's mother (Kathy Bates), her two BFFs -- Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) and John (James Marsters, 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer""). Later during the extended healing process, Holly befriends Daniel, the male parallel to Holly who's heartbreak is played exquisitely on his sleeve by Harry Connick Jr. Holly prefers to mourn alone, sulking in her apartment where her grief borders on mental illness and Gerry is resurrected in her mind like Harvey the rabbit. When mom and friends surprise her with a birthday cake, the real-life Gerry comes back into her life, first in the form of a recording he made before he died to wish her a happy birthday, knowing he won't be there. Kleenex please. Only to be followed by the romantic whopper ... a series of letters written in the same vein to Holly, with instructions for her to follow, in his sincere heartfelt attempt to ease her pain as a young widow.Forget the Kleenex, grab a roll of paper towels and prepare yourself for the Niagra Falls of happy tears in this romantic romp that will compel you to buy a nonstop flight to Ireland.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
PS - this is mindless drivel,"Whoever produced this just have just wanted a quickie - sit around w. The staff, brainstorm some stars for stereotypical character cameos - Cathy Bates, cranky, wise-cracking but luvable mother/mother-in-law, Lisa Kudrow, quirky too-talky nymphomaniac, Gerard Butler, irresistible Irish boffin, and on and on and on. There there's Hillary Swank singing ""I'll Love You Till the End"" accompanied by herself on her string guitar, well, best left unrecalled ....The story is mindless with a script of lifeless but unstoppable ""witty"" dialogue repartee.And, of course, to fill in the studio formula gaps in this concoction, a lot of going-on-for-too long curiously unenticing sex scenes, maybe because the characters are always forging through with the ongoing witless dialogue even during the entire exercises of the various encounters.As for the musical score, well, apparently there's a romantic NYC Irish theme being depicted - sweet sticky blarney 'n all - so the score is intermittantly spiced up w. Some good 'ole faux ""Irish"" step dancing lyricality - oh fer a steeeemin' playte of da EERish stew 'n potaytoes warshed down wid a mugga Guinness Xtra Stout ...And as for Hilary Swank's overall performance as the lead character, well, again, best lest unrecalled ..Gawd, I would have hated to have had to have been the editor on this mess of star-studded banality.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the disconnected RomComs in the history of  the medium...,"On paper this should have worked. A Hollywood A-list production with talent to die for. Swank, after an oddball role in a Karate Kid movie (not joking, look it up) sort of exploded onto the Hollywood scene and by and large has delivered nothing but great performances since. Don't think Connick has ever been less than great in a movie. Butler is usually superb as a dramatic or action lead. Supporting cast that includes Bates and Kudrow...? To mess up this film would itself be a feat but LaGravenese did it.Let's be clear. This film falls apart from the first few scenes and then, remarkably, just gets worse. There is no chemistry between Butler and Swank. None. Zero. Zip. Nada. And if you don't buy into the initial chemistry, then the rambling and erratically edited scenes which follow -- about a dead husband who keeps sending mail to his widow -- is not romantic or fun or engaging, it is just plain creepy.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

I'm a bloke....I don't cry...sniff!,"I always have trouble sleeping on planes, so on a recent long haul to Singapore (particularly as I had the misfortune to be seated next to the worlds most flatulent woman) I decided to check out the movies and pick one that appeared deadly dull and slumber inducing. Casting my eye down the play list (damn, no BloodRayne) PS I love You seemed to fit the bill nicely. Guaranteed chick-flick-coma material.Congratulating myself on this master plan, I donned the earphones and blanket, turned my shoulder from Methane Woman and snuggled down for a good 90 minutes kip.Not a hope! From the outset I was enthralled, then amused, then sad, then happy, then sad again, as the movie gripped my emotions for a ride every bit as turbulent as my travelling companions trousers.Great story, delivered by a surprising mix of actors, which tugged and tore at the heart strings...poked and prodded the funny bone...teased and tormented the intellect, all with deadly accuracy and impeccable timing, toward an ultimately bitter-sweet finale.When it was over, there was a little tightness in my throat, a touch of a sniffle in my nose and, yes, the swell of a tear in my eye....if that woman doesn't stop soon I'll be dead before Singapore.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Appalling,"My point of view comes from being a new widow and having spent a great deal of time with other widows. I waited 5 months to see this movie because I was told the plot and didn't feel ready to expose myself. Tonight I finally watched it and the only reason this movie is getting two stars from me is that, not even once, not even close, not ever, ever, ever will it make me cry.The reason is, this movie is a completely and utterly unrealistic portrayal of losing a spouse/loved one/SO. I won't belabor the point by beating up the actors, although what a waste of some real talent, but it's the story that deserves my disdain.For starters, there is NO mention of how courageous it was of Jerry to have spent his dying time setting this whole incredulous thing up. Also no mention of the amount of time spent care-giving on Ms. Swank's part. He just DIED of a brain of brain tumor, and that's all we know. Nobody gets an concept of how much that affected everyone during that dying time. The cancer spreads to all involved. But, not this group.My husband battled melanoma for three years and most of that time he felt pretty well. I spent a long time with other cancer victims and the uppermost thing on each and every person's mind was spending every waking moment WITH the person they were going to leave, not concocting some way to control afterward. There are far more practical matters that take up your time and you are exhausted beyond belief when it is 'over'. Trust me on this one.Anyway, this movie makes me very angry by supporting the long-held belief that grief is to be surmounted on anyone's time-line. I was guilty of this until it happened to me and it's a very large lie. Until you've been there, don't write stories, or books, or fluffy movies about something so intensely painful.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
P.S I love you...what can I say?,"Overall I loved P.S I love you. Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler had ton of chemistry and really were believable as a couple. I thought that this was a great romantic comedy that really made you think about your life and love in general. While this movie was extremely emotional and made me cry the rest of day, I would continue to watch this movie over and over despite the emotional roller coaster it put me through. I really love the fact that unlike many other sad tear-jerker movies you are able to see the emotions and pulling of life back together after the death of a loved one. I really hope to find a love like that shared by Holly and Gerry. I loved the flashbacks of their relationship and the emotions of Holly. I loved Jeffrey Dean Morgan's character and he did a great job. I did not like Harry Connick Jr.'s character at all but he played it well. Holly's friends, Gina Gershon and Lisa Kudrow were awesome and really added to the feeling of love in the movie. Overall while this movie was mainly about the love lost between Gerry and Holly it also held a lot of humor, wit, love of family and friends, and the journey of finding yourself again. I would recommend that if you cried through the whole thing the first time go see it again and you will catch all the humor and other lovely parts of the film. This movie was very different from the book, but I liked the movie more than the book.Overall I give it 10/10 and it really is great to go see with your girlfriends. :D Check it out!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rubbish...,"Are you kidding me? How could they even come up with such a trashy film? Totally ruin the novel. First of all, Hillary Swank is not fit for the character.

I am so surprised to find the rate is 7.0! I expected it to be like 4 or below than that.

Surprised to see my boy Spike in the show, James Marsters, does a great job as the best friend. His little speech in the alternate scenes describes what a best friend is to a guy perfectly. In that added scene he reads a letter and says something to the effect of Gerry was right, or he didn't lie, does anyone know what he is talking about.Oh and by the way there are tons of guys this devoted and loving in the world, just most are not this good looking or talented.

"Woebegone romantic weepie...brash, miscast, unpleasant","Hilary Swank is a wonderful actress, but light romantic drama with the occasional comedic inflection doesn't appear to be her forte. Here, Swank, forthright in all the wrong ways, is uncomfortably cast as a young widow who is surprised to discover her deceased husband (the victim of a brain tumor) has left behind a series of messages to help her onto the next phase of her life. This turn of events is surprising to us, as well; from what we are able to ascertain from their marriage, their union mostly consisted of petty bickering and childish misunderstandings (Gerard Butler's striptease notwithstanding). Butler and Swank are a mismatched pair of doomed lovers (Butler isn't light on his feet, either), while the star-studded supporting cast seem indifferent to all this he-she nonsense. Swank is mooned over by friendly barkeep Harry Connick Jr., but this casting gambit fails as well--with Connick far more likely to be Swank's brother than a potential love-interest. Another dreadful, 'modern' romance, the type wherein the girl, drunk, pours her heart out to the guy...and then vomits on his shoes for a quick guffaw.

Wendy Finerman has produced a winner with tremendous charisma between Hilary Swank as Holly, and the attractive Gerard Butler as Jerry. New York's lower east side is a location which adds to the story and to the characters' journey. Lisa Kudrow, per usual, adds such tremendous humor in lines which are well written and delivered.

Be glad when it is all over,"Hilary Swank plays Holly Kennedy, a fragile real estate broker who cannot hold down her job and gets married young to happy go lucky Irishman Gerry (Gerard Butler) but he dies of a brain tumour leaving Holly as a grieving young widow whose life comes to a stand still.On her 30th birthday party she gets a surprise posthumous letter from Gerry informing her that he will be regularly sending her messages containing tasks that she is to perform without question or hesitation. Each message is signed off with the words PS I Love You.With the help of her friends and family Holly follows Gerry's messages such as singing in a bar or going to his Irish village to meet his parents. With the aid of flashbacks we see the significance of some of these tasks. This all leads to a possible romance with eccentric but funny bartender (Harry Connick Jr) who admires her from afar but realises that she may not be ready to move on from Gerry.Eventually Holly learns that these tasks from Gerry is for her to put the past behind her and move on with her life.As a romantic comedy the film is a maudlin cringe inducing mess. I was dumbstruck with the sheer awfulness of this contrived nonsense. I never really bought Holly and Gerry as a couple and believed for a second that Gerry could plan all these tasks for his wife when he was dying.Just look at the scenes set in Ireland. Holly ventures into a small pub and just happens to stumble upon someone singing a song that Gerry sang to her. She is pushed by her friends to have a drink with the singer (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and before long they end up in bed because he also just happens to single and available.

The Chickiest Chick Flick I've Ever Seen.,"As a guy, I can say parts of this movie were just painful to sit through. Don't be turned off by that first sentence thinking this is going to be a biased review, there's reason why it was painful and it's not just because I'm a guy.There were some entertaining points, but as a whole, it was far too sentimental to feel genuine. Just about every other scene is a flashback to the dead husband where all the girls in the audience are supposed to let out a sympathetic, ""Awwww,"" but if you're a movie buff that can tell when a movie is just overdoing it, those scenes become incredibly tedious. Some of them seem to go on forever, and all they do is show something we already know: She misses her husband.Well DUH! We get it, already, let's move on with the story. The problem is that half the story is that one fact. The main character misses her husband. Each letter brings about a similar flashback which is again tedious if you're looking for something to actually happen in terms of plot, or some further realization about the characters. The flashbacks don't reveal anything of significance- When they met isn't really that important by the last fifteen minutes of the movie.The whole time I felt like I was watching a movie made specifically to get sentimental feelings from the audience, but it kept harping on the same points so that those points got in the way of the story and slowed things down to a dull shuffle. Most ""chick flicks"" have some redeeming qualities for men dragged along by their girlfriends-- A sense of humor that they can laugh along with or a plot that includes a decent male character that has a role other than to bring jealousy out of the female audience. While this movie has a sense of humor, it's far too ""cute"" to be redeeming for the typical male population. The plot is centered around women, and I think it's safe to say that the movie is aimed only at women.At two hours and six minutes, the thing just drags by the end. I found myself studying my watch a good half an hour before it was over.So in summary, if you're a guy and you're girlfriend wants to take you to this, you'll probably be trying not to let out snide remarks the whole time, so tell her she should bring her girlfriends to see it instead, as you'll just ruin it. And girls, if you're looking for a sad movie that has a decent sense of ""cutesy"" humor, go with your girlfriends, but please, spare your man the trouble of trying to sit through it.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good film...catered to adults,"For anyone past their mid-20's this film has plenty. Life can throw all kinds of unexpected stuff at you, and this film has tenderness, honesty, the good & bad, the laughter & tears, and a couple of good lessons, too. The actors do a fine job of making what could have easily been a hokey film into something far better than hokey.Watching this I was reminded of another Richard LaGravenese film, ""Living Out Loud"". That movie is one of my all-time favorites, and it also seems to be aimed at a more adult viewer. Granted, there are parts of the film that seem contrived, but that's what movies are for, eh? Escape, entertainment, and suspension of reality. :) I found poignant moments throughout the film and not necessarily at the parts that most would expect. Just like life, I found that some of the most moving times were with the smallest of gestures. That being said I didn't ever feel manipulated; but having lived a good number of years, I could certainly relate to a number of moments in the film.Overall, it was money well spent at the theater which is more than I can say for a lot of other crud out there.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overlong Look at the Grieving Process Spotlighting an Uncharacteristically Miscast Swank,"Grief can be a painfully long process, but does that mean a movie needs to capture that experience in real time? Actually a year elapses in this marathon 126-minute film, but director Richard LaGravenese's episodic treatment is so sluggish that the end didn't come soon enough for me. This is the first of several problems with this 2007 romantic dramedy and co-written by LaGravenese and Steven Rogers and actually not the biggest. That dubious distinction belongs to star Hilary Swank as Holly Kennedy, a high-strung Manhattan real estate agent closing in on thirty and married nearly a decade to Gerry, a hunky, free-wheeling Irish musician. Physically angular with a performance pitched between severely pinched and gawkily awkward, Swank lacks the innate malleability to carry off the role. It's the type that Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock can do in their sleep, but obviously the torch has to be passed. Despite moments of genuine likability and vulnerability, Swank lets it drop.The movie opens with a lengthy and extremely contrived marital squabble between Holly and Gerry and then wastes no time in flashing forward months later to Gerry's wake at the Irish bar that Holly's mother runs. Throughout the rest of the movie, Holly grieves by having frequent flashbacks to the happier days with Gerry, that is, when she is not fantasizing about Gerry still being alive. The plot turns on the conceit that he wrote a series of letters before his death that he intends to be delivered to Holly at key moments during her first year without him, and Holly's responses to the letters make up what constitutes the impetus of the storyline. There are some poorly developed turns, but there are some good moments primarily courtesy of an unusually stellar supporting cast starting with Kathy Bates as Holly's straight-shooting mother whose own husband left her in a less tragic manner; Gina Gershon as Sharon, one of Holly's best friends; and Lisa Kudrow as her other friend, the more hedonistic Denise. In fact, Kudrow's crack comedy timing is such a contrast to Swank's tentative, redundant manner that it upsets the balance of the film.The men fare somewhat better. A genuinely charismatic actor, Gerard Butler plays Gerry with such unfettered joy that it really is a wonder why he is attracted to Holly in the first place. Their ""cute"" first encounter on an isolated Irish road is painful to watch not because of Gerry's impending doom but because Swank overdoes her impersonation of a na√Øve college student. As potential paramour Billy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, an American actor who actually does a better Irish accent than Butler (a Scotsman) lends the necessary smoldering presence, but he is painted too ideally to be that compelling. Harry Connick, Jr., on the other hand, plays a genuinely idiosyncratic suitor, Daniel, a somewhat off-kilter bartender who may have Asperger's Syndrome. It's an oddly discomforting ploy, but at least it's different, and Connick shows he still has a good comedy sense. Rural Ireland certainly looks idyllic thanks to Terry Stacey's cinematography, although I have to say the musical soundtrack comes across as too predictably coy to help complement scenes. I recommend skipping this one for more worthwhile treatments on grieving like Anthony Minghella's ""Truly Madly Deeply"" or even Jerry Zucker's ""Ghost"".",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
What type of Chocalate do you  like...

I for one prefer open ended stories that allow the viewer the freedom to imagine and write the ending how they see fit this movie allows for this.The entire movie is focused on the journey that a newly widowed woman undergoes along with the people closest to her.Can a long dead husband through help and the time machine that written words represent help his wife's journey? Is his passing similar by accident or purpose to her father's sudden disappearance? Is the journey through life we go through always fraught with possibilities forks in our paths?

"Sweet, sad and heartwarming","One of the better romantic dramas that I've seen. P.S. I Love You has a storyline that's at the same time just outlandish and exotic enough that it keeps you invested and excited, yet it's still just within the realm of possibility so that you can reflect on how you would react in a situation like the one in the film. Plus it's a rather sweet and touching story about love, loss and sometimes being unable to move on.The thing that impressed me to most, though, was the fact that the film actually acknowledged that we usually view our lost loved ones through rose-tinted glasses. Because we actually see Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hilary Swank) arguing before he passes away. And yet the rest of the film spends most of its time depicting Gerry as a saint. Thus it'd be so easy to call his character unrealistic and naive, if not for that arguing that turns the whole thing upside down, because in most cases it's Holly that's doing the depicting. And more often than not, we do like to remember our lost loves with fondness. So the movie nails that aspect of grieving rather perfectly. Though Gerry is still a rather amazing guy. I'd say a bit too amazing, but it's a romantic drama. It's wish-fulfillment.So the story works. Add in good characters, some interesting locations, Ireland and a rather colourful visual style and you have film that's a very nice way to spend a few hours. It's not going to challenge your view of the world or anything that extravagant, but it'll make you feel better, I guarantee. It's heart-rendering, sweet, lovable, sad and uplifting, all at the same time and it certainly has scenes that will stick with you. Especially the first meeting between Holly and Gerry. I loved that scene. And you should check it out as well.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"PS I love you is a controversial Film. I give it a ten, but","I've read perhaps two-dozen reviews on this film. People either like it or they hate it: very few are in the middle.There are those who have lost mates and those who are going to perhaps and those who have not lost anyone, or have not said they have. There is no clear pattern although I would have to say that those who lost someone had the most decided feelings whichever way they felt about it.I have lost someone (my first wife). I know that this film avoids the reality of watching someone suffer pain and anger and not being able to do anything about it.The movie is only 2 hours long, a fact we often forget when watching films. Life can make us live through events that take months or years.Mourning is not easy. It is full of remembered joy and love, regret, guilt, loneliness, confusion, rage and a whole gamut of ugly and beautiful emotions almost too numerous to list.One lady I read said she hated the film because she found reminders everywhere: she would be completely unhinged by letters from the grave. I completely respect that point of view, and believe hers was a very real response.I do not share it. I wish I could send letters the other way. I wish I could tell her how much I miss her. I wish I could say some of the things she deserves to hear that I could not tell her while she lived. I wish I could thank her for the education she gave me just by living with me.That's what I think this film is about. Gerry (Gerald Butler) loves and is married to Holly (Hillary Swank). The opening scene before the credits shows them having a terrible fight where all their unspoken fundamental differences are shouted at each other. Then the credits. Then a new scene where there is Gerry's wake. Then a series of 10 letters, each one with another request and another part of the plan which he intends to heal her and lead her from mourning to health and perhaps to celebration.He knows her well. He suggests things that she would not do on her own, but that she needs to do. She needed to clean up the apartment, not because it would give her more room, but because it would give her emotions more space. There's quite a difference. She needs to get out and do things she was not good at (like sing) because singing is the language of the soul, and hers needed awakening. (Don't look for Swank to sing well. She doesn't.) She needed to go to Ireland, because it was not America and she needed to make contact with not only his body and mind, but his very essence.Slowly she finds her own talents, her own expressions, her own feelings, and her own way of celebrations. Kathy Bates is wonderful as the mother: tough as a steel girder, soft as pliable as paper. The two friends are a delight (although many people who saw this movie did not think so.) The hesitancy on my part only depends on how we can be swallowed not by what is, but what we wish to be true. Remember to read as many reviews as you can. Some people liked it; many did not. I am easily won over because I like Hilary Swank. Even her so/so movies get a good rating from me (like The Freedom Writers.)I saw this film in the same audience as 6 ten year old girls. I would have thought that this film was totally inappropriate for them. However when it was over, one of them said to one of the others, ""I really liked this film. It was so sad. I cried three times. How many times did you cry?""The sadness struck me as well. I could have answered her question if asked. She would have given it ten out of ten. So would I, but I understand those who would not.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good movie, but so horribly sad!","My sister recommended this movie to me, but by the time I checked it out from the library, I had totally forgotten anything she might have told me about it. The DVD case bills it as a romantic comedy, and the description on the back barely tells anything about it. So I was expecting a lighthearted romantic comedy and ended up with a movie that was so sad I couldn't stop crying. And movies hardly ever make me cry!Don't get me wrong--this is definitely a good movie, and it reminds you that you need to live your life and really make the most of it. Not only that, but it's got some beautiful scenery and music in it. So go ahead and watch this, but be prepared to cry!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautiful on screen, dull with the emotion","PS I Love You isn't a terrible movie, it's just that it is not necessarily a good one either. The book I agree is better, much more coherent and emotional to the core. What I did like about PS I Love You was the gorgeous scenery and lilting soundtrack. Also Kathy Bates gives a beautifully understated performances that at least elevated the appeal of the film a bit. Also the film does start off really well, with some genuine emotion there. However, the story is rather disjointed with some awkward shifts, and the pace throughout is rather slow and dull. Emotionally, particularly in the middle it feels rather unfocused and hollow, and very few of the characters I cared entirely for. Gerard Butler and Hilary Swank are okay and are easy on the eyes but the chemistry doesn't quite resonate. Overall, neither bad or good, just verging on average. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Movie,"I'm so surprised to see that so many people hated this movie. I personally thought it was great. A lot of people complained that it was not faithful enough to the book. I read the book and, of course it was great. But it's understandable that the people who made the movie left some of the details out. It 's a MOVIE! I mean, as amazing as it was, I don't think the book was really meant to be that comedic. It was a little depressing to be honest. The movie was definitely lighter and ended on a happier note (yet still quite touching). After all, it is meant to be a romantic comedy ( more ""romantic"" than ""comedy""). Loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
wow!!,"This film is simply so romantic and inspirational that it is a must see. The first time I watched it I absolutely adored it and every time since it has not got old. Definitely 10/10 and my favourite film of all time .The story it takes you on is one of passion and self belief, if you do not believe in true love you will after watching this breath taking film.Gerard Butler plays the most perfect man ever created and Hilary Swank gives an amazing performance.

The only movie that stands equal to its Book counterpart.,"This is my favourite movie (it's the only one I can think of when somebody asks me that question) and also my go-to cry movie. I lovee love, and I love the Holly-Gerry love, but I'm not sure if the trailer does it justice. I hadn't watched the trailer until I sat down to write this and I guess it's a bit outdated, well it's a 2007 movie. This movie lets you experience a rollercoaster of emotions and maybe you'll even experience the 5 stages of grief. But don't worry, it will leave you with your heart full and a smile plastered to your face (even though your tears have gone sticky and dry).Now this may not be your typical happy-ending kind of movie, but it's a typical, come-fall-in-love kind of movie, and those are some of the best kinds. I don't always bother about who plays the characters but since it's a favourite, I did, and nobody better could have played Holly and Gerry than Hillary Swank and Gerard Butler. Your 2 hours will be well spent.On a different note is P. S. To All the Boys (the Lara Jean Covey movies) the new P. S. I Love You?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awful and Long Winded,"This movie is soo depressing, but not because of the story, but mainly because the storyline is so unbelievably slow, and it keeps running in endless loops. The acting is average at best, and the script is a hodge podge of romantic-comedy clich√©s. It really is poorly executed, and the editing leaves a lot to be desired. About 3/4s of the way through I realised the only reason it hadn't ended at the recognised Rom-Com hour and half, was because they were trying their hardest to create a movie with substance, but it failed miserably in the end, and in all decency, an hour and a half should have been the limit with this one. Do yourself a favour, and don't watch it. The only people praising this movie would have to be associated with it (ie. producers etc.). Put simply, it's awful and long winded.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
How sweet!,"P.S. I love you really is a very sweet heart warming film. Hilary Swank is perfectly cast as holly, the young widow who is receiving letters from her dead husband Jerry while trying to get over him and find a new life. Gerard Butler is also perfectly cast here as Jerry. Kathy Bates is good in her motherly role, and Harry Connick Jr. is alright, kind of a strange role to be honest, but he did alright. Lisa Kudrow is very funny and gives a witty enjoyable performance as the best friend. The script is cute sometimes, dramatic when it wants to be, and then funny when it's appropriate. The beginning of the movie is well done, showing their raw marriage, both the good and the bad side of it. The little striptease by Gerard butler was funny and well placed. Then going from that to the funeral service at the bar was good, showing the grief and emotion. The movie isn't too slow or too fast in pace, I think it's just right. I really did like how the movie had a good range of emotions, rich in both humor and seriousness. The Ireland trip with the best friends was entertaining, and indecently where something good happens (I won't tell you what). I don't why the majority of critics panned the film, I really enjoyed it, and I came out of it feeling satisfied and that I made the right decision by seeing it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Boring and superficial,"I like Hilary Swank and Kathy Bates, but this time I just couldn't be won over. At no point did I care about any of the characters.The ""Irish"" accent from Butler made me want to cut my ears off! I have lived in Ireland, Irish people don't sound like that!It drags on with attempts at being funny, but it just never hits home for me. What on Earth makes people cry to this movie?? There's not a real emotion anywhere. It's far too long, feels overtly superficial for such a heavy subject and fails even at the light hearted stuff. Like watching a stage play with low grade actors.Again, I usually admire Swank and Bates but I won't recommend this to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A lacking weeper,"If you've gotten to this comment, you pretty much know what this movie is all about: recently widowed Hillary Swank is made whole again by letters that come from her now-dead husband; after a year, she's healed. Yada-yada-yada.What's wrong with this movie? Let's begin with the writing. Not only is the dialog horribly wooden, but the structure is terrible, and not one single character emerges from the page as a 3-dimensional being.So let's give the director a break. Stuck with more plod than plot - it wouldn't be easy to breathe life into this DOA movie-thing. It was obviously impossible to bring Harry Connick Jr out of a catatonic state and Lisa Kudrow just falls back to her sitcom tics. (But, don't feel too bad for them - the whole country of Ireland is also bereft of its charm and good looks as well).This a silly movie; designed to make you cry.

The Book and now Movie,Well all I want to say is that I am a great reader and read this book in about 1.5 days. It is absolutely brilliant and have not had the chance to see the movie yet (due to children.......) but I cannot wait to see that such a fantastic book can be created into this mind blowing film. You have to relate with the characters to relate to book for film. I just hope the picturisation and production of the film is as excellent as the book. Definitely a film to watch with your man. I think Gerry would open up a few male eyes as to how women really want to be loved or should I say need to be loved. I sometimes wonder if some men around and involved with us ladies forget how we really need to be looked after and loved.......... All I can say to all girlfriends in the world is see the movie and if you cant then definitely read the book. PS. I love you..................... Kay,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love It!,I loved the movie. It went right up my alley when it comes to movies that I like. I thought that the acting of the characters was well done by the cast. Though I must say I didn't care too much for the mother. I know her intentions were good but she just didn't seem to come out as being that nice or great of a person. You can tell that Hilary and Gerard had really good chemistry between them in the scenes and could really pass as two people who were in love and married. You don't always see that in movies. It was a very heartwarming and touching movie. But it has also moments where you almost forget about the sadness cause you're laughing so much. Great movie. I highly recommend it.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
For a girl who isn't into chick flicks...,"After somewhat reluctantly agreeing to watch this movie on a girls-night-in, I was pleasantly surprised.This film is intelligent and well written, though perhaps a little long. It contains elements of drama, comedy and tragedy, and shows the journey of recovery of a grieving woman after her husband, the man she had envisioned growing old with, dies too young and too early.If you like chick flicks, you'll love this, if you don't, you'll probably still like it anyway.It looks gorgeous, the actors are all charming and perfectly cast - Hillary Swank is great and Gerard Butler is both gorgeous and lovable. You never think ""Get over it Hillary"" because you see enough of the two as a couple to see just why she misses him so much. The film has a good balance and you will laugh as much as you will cry, it's not too sappy or silly which seems a rarity in the rom-com (although I would call this film rom-drama-com) genre these days.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
P.S. I Hate it,"I'm usually a sucker for romantic weepies but this one fails miserably.The problems begin immediately as the film abruptly starts with an argument between the two main characters Holly (Hillary Swank) and Gerry (Gerard Butler). Then they are kissing and making up and Gerry does an awkward strip tease that is meant to amuse the audience and show what a lovable guy he is. Next scene; Gerry is dead from a brain tumor. Where did this come from? Did we even know he was sick. He certainly looked fine in the last scene.The plot revolves around a bunch of letters sent to Holly mysteriously from Gerry (written before he died)which guide her and encourage her to release her fears and live life to the fullest. These scenes plod along and are mixed with flashbacks and I didn't care about any of it. Gerard Butler and Hillary Swank had no chemistry. Gerard Butler basically is so cheerful and buoyant in every scene that the scenes just didn't ring true. Hillary Swank did her best, but with a weak leading man and poor script, she has little to work with. The supporting characters had little to do in underwritten parts, especially Harry Connick whose part could have been cut without it being missed.I still like Hillary Swank, but she's treading on thin ice now.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant Film,"I watched PS I Love You for the very first time today and it made me cry it was so sad, and normally films don't actually make me cry not titanic or any other sad film, i just don't seem to cry i think its sad but not tear worthy. But this film was a real tearjerker the acting was superb and Hillary Swank performed the role perfectly. Although Lisa Cudrow was good she played the same kind of character as she always does the dippy blonde who will go for any guy but eventually finds the right one i.e phoebe from friends. This film is well worth watching for anyone because it was so refreshing to see something new for once as this kind of film as far as i know hasn't really been done or at least if it has its not stuck in my mind. I'm so used to watching the same kind of remakes of old films or hybrid films. So yeah anyone thinking of watching should go for it because its so refreshing.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pay $3 no more for a ticket to this sitcom movie.,"And here is the reason why: it has Lisa Kudrow continuing her FRIENDS pantomime... and that alone pulls the whole movie down into TV movie level. Otherwise, with Oscar winning female talent and a handsome Tom Jones /Richard Burton hybrid in Gerard Butler we end up with a very likable small movie that has outsized femme talent crammed into it..... this is a film that should have been made with no name female actors. In a GHOST meets TRULY MADLY DEEPLY way P.S. is charming and utilises travelogue imagery to make itself 'international'.

Resurrects more than a grief-stricken widow,"To say I am not the romantic type would pretty much hit the mark. The usual flick would make me at the most willing to take an unpleasant phone call for the idea of it. But I must say, as it is not five minutes after the credits of ""P.S. I Love You"" rolled over my screen, that I am impressed and surprisingly hopeful.I read in the synopsis that Butler's character dies pretty much in the beginning of the movie, so I was a little disappointed, since he was the source of my interest for ""P.S. I Love You"" . He, however, graces with his presence during the entire movie, proving right its main idea with talent and incredible presence. Furthermore, Swank's acting was amazing. After her all-consuming popularity I was downright sick seeing her face everywhere. But she managed once again to give a unique and capturing performance, making a bond with everyone around her so that the scene works naturally.The movie itself was a pleasant surprise and worthy addition to the already bulky flick genre. What caught my fancy was these moments when the drama gets a bit over the top, or a silly detail at first sight slipped by mistake sets it, and the main character pinpoints that exact thing, loosing the tension and making you feel a part of the action.The music, too, was not corny, and not walking a single line of thought. A slight, gentle tune here, a wild and hilarious 'funeral' song there, set the mood right.And Ireland... well. There is a famous saying, and I am pretty convinced it's not a nationalistic propaganda. You're either born Irish, or wanting to be one. So don't miss the chance to catch a glimpse of that breathtaking nature... and population.9/10, and you better not miss it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Gerard Butler - A  Drop Dead Lady Killer,"While to be honest, I find the movie more than a bit lightweight and predictable, one shining star emerges from the film - Gerard Butler. He is oozing with sex appeal and brimming with personality - an appealing dollop of ""man candy"" for the ladies!I think the problems with the movie stemmed from the dialogue/script more than the performances. A little more substantive dialogue could have been interspersed between the over-the-top ""romantic comedy"" scenes which frankly wore thin.But truthfully, its hard to know what is more appealing about the relative newcomer Gerard Butler - his appearance or his personality. He's quite a versatile actor, and a drop dead lady killer, and he is definitely going places - watch for him!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie is a path for those who Live for the Love that's Lost,"""Love is a Rose Forever after.""Even after death of Gerry, Holly finds herself holding on to his Love & refusing to move on. It is a romantic comedy picturing young widow Holly Kennedy (Hillary Swank) going back to life after suffering the loss of her life; death of her husband and best friend Gerry (Gerard Butler) Based on Cecelia Ahern's Bestseller 'P.S. I Love You' which was originally set in Ireland, the screenplay was Americanized for the satisfaction of director Richard LaGravenese.The movie starts with happy and contended young couple having a fight over not having a baby soon & transforms into a scene where a gloomy young widow is attending her husband's funeral. Holly has just lost her husband and is re-living each and every memory of past and has refused to let go anything belonging to her late husband. She remembers the fights they used to have over little things & how they were an asset. Her family & friends are also disturbed with her condition & want to bring her back to life. For that they plan to celebrate Holly's 30th birthday by paying a surprised visit to her place and are quite surprised by her appearance in Gerry's night gown without having bathed for days. While they are trying to talk some sense into her and improving her as well as house's condition condition a parcel arrives for her with an audio tape recorded by Gerry, promising to send her letters (all ending with 'Ps, I love You) for each month of the year & helping her to rise up to life once again. Gerry has planned a whole journey for Holly to rediscover herself starting with a holiday trip to Ireland (where they first met) with her girl friends Sharon & Denise. There she gets to know about big happenings in their lives and feels lost and shadowed by solitude. Arriving home, Holly again withdraws from family and friends. As she continues to become more and more lost, she discovers she has a flair for designing women's shoes and enrolls in a class that teaches how to actually make the shoes she has designed. A new found self-confidence allows her to emerge from her solitude and embrace her friends' happiness. While on a walk with her mother, she learns that her mother was the one whom Gerry asked to deliver his letters after his death and receives the last letter. As the film ends with Holly taking her mother on a trip to Ireland, we see that Holly has opened herself up to the journey beginning with the next chapter of her life, and wherever it takes her she has the hope of falling in love again.With a heartbreaking beginning this movie takes us to the unique quest of finding true meaning of life after losing Love of our life. However Americanization of novel has brought a change in details and feel of the story but the magic remains the same. Unlikely to the other romantic comedies this one leaves a bittersweet effect after which you won't think twice about making up with your partner. With its magical soundtracks and uncommon storyline this movie will leave you dumbfounded. Now for those who like to read books first, this movie has some major flaws regarding the cast. Not much effort can be seen on director's side as cast was wrongheaded to some extent. Hillary Swank and Gerard Butler could have been considered best choice for the lead but even their part wasn't flawless. Soundtrack 'Love you till the end' unveils the true soul of this magical tale and clings to your mind for a long long time. But after all that effort it won't make you think that movies can be better than Books.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

If you can stand a liiiittle bit of cussing, and some brief nudity then this is prefect for just about anyone. This movie had me cursing life wishing death could never happen. I was happy, I was sad, I laughed and I cried, and in the end, I called everyone I knew telling them to watch this movie.

P.S. I Love You (2007),"Annoying dialogue starts this movie off. It's the typical kind of dialogue written by somebody thinking they are clever, however the stale clich√©s they throw out just highlight their lack of imagination. So after Swank and Butler annoy me for 12 minutes, Butler dies and the film is a look at love, life and letting go. It's similar to other movies like this, there's a nice guy that is understanding of the widow's situation, but by the end he is an angry and unpleasant person. The biggest problem is that the message is obvious before viewing, and it doesn't unravel in an interesting nor original fashion. It certainly robs itself of any humanity by forgetting that life isn't this simple. There are some excellently hilarious lines, but this hits neither the tear jerking moments, nor the uplifting feel that it's aiming for.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie!  One of the best I have seen this year.,"What a great story,somewhat original which is hard to find these days. Although perhaps a little predictable it still kept my attention through to the last line. The story was developed very plausible and had a feel good quality to it throughout the movie. it is refreshing to watch drama unfold with the feel good theme and not have things blowing up or action hero's winning the day battling against evil.The acting was superb, Hillary Swank does a great job, what a class act she is. It was great to see her win an award for her efforts. Suppoting roles where strong and believable. The only weakness was in Harry Conick Jr.'s character. I am not sure what it was, the script or the actor failing to deliver but some small thing seemed to be missing.Unfortunate the Academy did not see fit to give this movie any credit. Over all a job well done by everyone. I will buy this one for my collection when it becomes available.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
please tell me,"why Hilary Swank is so highly regarded? She's a good actress but she isn't a great actress. She was very good in Boys Don't Cry but it helps that she looks like an anorexic boy. But other than that she's been very average or less than average. Million Dollar baby was a good movie but neither the direction nor the acting was outstanding. Morgan Freeman was good as the haggard old boxing teacher/custodian/friend. No way Eastwood should have gotten a nod for directing that predictable tripe. No way Swank should have won another Oscar.Freedom Writers was a good movie but switch Swank out with any other average actress and its still the same movie.Now this movie is the same thing. The difference between an average actress and a great actress? A great actress makes the role her own, a role that you know cannot be played by another actress to the same ability. Swank can't do that, not now and probably not ever.So while the movie is OK Swank is once again, average. But you've got to give credit to her agent for getting her roles in movies that have good scripts and decent crews from directors on down because she could no more carry a film on her talent or looks alone than could well, Lisa Kudrow for instance, who should have called it a career the day Friends wrapped (of course that could be said about the entire cast of Friends.)PS I CAN'T STAND YOU",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect Valentine's day film,"First of all, usually movies like this aren't realistic or able to make people relate to the characters or situations but this film actually did the opposite. There were situations in this film that certain people could easily relate to. Of course, nobody has received letters from their dead significant other but they can at least relate to what Holly is going through. It depicts how somebody might react to losing somebody that is very close to them. The acting done by everybody really helped with that. With every scene, you could easily tell how they were feeling in that moment even if they weren't speaking. You could just tell through their faces and body. The acting between the two leads had to be good because you needed to feel like these two really loved each other and they succeed. In every scene that you see Holly and Jerry together, you believe that they are a happy couple and would do anything for the other. There were some problems though. One was the pacing of the film. Now this one mainly is affected by the scenes in this film and how they didn't really connect anything. They just jumped around with zero transitions at all. There also was a bunch of time jumps so you couldn't figure out what was going on and where Holly was in her life. Some of the side characters were annoying and unnecessary. In the end, they really were just there to be her ""support"" during this rough time. Finally, as much as I loved the couple I wish we saw them more. You see them together for a bit but I think it would have hit home if they showed them together because then the audience would be more sympathetic to Holly. In the end, this is a great Valentines day movie to watch either by yourself or with your significant other.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The characters involved have excellent chemistry, and it flows so well, you almost forgot you are watching a movie, and not real life.

My favorite movie of all times!!!,"This movie is my favorite movie ever! I say that based on the fact that i could (and have) watch it over and over again. It's just so sweet it went right to my heart and stayed there. It does fall in the romantic comedy category but it's so much more and I definitely recommend it to everyone although I'm sure it will definitely find more fans among the female population.Reason number 1 for loving this movie: the story. It's just such a lovely combination of funny, love and drama that it just brings a rainbow of emotions that not many movies do. I cried and laughed and cried again and so on...Although it's a love story I don't find it cheesy, it's quite refreshingly realistic in some aspects (as shown in the many little fights Holly & Gerry have). I wish maybe Holly was less bitchy at times but I think in the end that would have hurt the story a little and stolen from the humour of the situations so I guess it's for the best she was as she was portrait.Reason number 2 for loving this movie: the cast. Gerard Butler is funny and handsome and just overall adorable and after seeing this movie I instantly became a fan (you should watch ""Frankie"", by the way). His singing and dancing are just the cherry on top amounting to a pretty dreamy leading man. I could go on and on but this is not about my crush on him so I'll just stop right here. Hilary Swank was very adorable too and I think it was a great choice. Wonderful performance, funny in all the right places and dramatic enough to make me cry. I definitely enjoyed the supporting characters as well: Harry Connick Jr. was so cute and funny, Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon as well. Jeffrey Dean Morgan I knew from Grey's Anatomy and he was just as charming as I had remembered but when Gerard Butler is around there isn't any competition really.Reason number 3 for loving this movie: the soundtrack. I looked it up after seeing the movie and have been listening to the songs ever since. Personal favorites: ""I love you till the end"" by The Pogues & ""Galway girl"" by Steve Earl.Last but not least it was made after a book so that was a nice surprise - I usually prefer the book in comparison with the motion picture but in this case since the movie came first into my world I preferred not to read the book. The movie was perfect and it was enough. (*sigh and thinking of watching it again...)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Postal traumatic stress,"Friday night is movie night in our house and so my wife pipes up to say that she's found a nice movie for us to watch together. It's a modern day romantic comedy, although probably with more of the former than the latter, set at least partly in New York, where we happily spent our twentieth wedding anniversary last year and it even starts at Christmas time, ditto. I recognise the title as that of a fairly recent best selling novel written by the daughter of the then Irish President if I remember rightly so with all this to process I think I pretty much knew what to expect.After starting with a deliberately unconvincing lovers' tiff, amorously resolved of course, the movie shifts gear briefly as we're suddenly brought up to date and transported to the funeral wake of the garrulous musicianly Irish husband. Unsurprisingly, the wife goes to pieces, not going out, locking herself away from her mother, sister and brother in law and her two best girlfriends and generally living like a slob.Somehow her deceased husband has anticipated all this and to get her back into circulation has set up an itinerary for her, starting every new season over the next year, gradually revealing his well laid plans to her in the form of cryptic letters mailed to her, her family and friends which see her end up going out with her girlies to a gay bar and then further afield to his native Ireland where they first met (cue extended flashback!). In the background there's a faithful barman who's always had a crush on her but you know it's really just a matter of time before her heart comes out of the fridge and she resolves all her outstanding issues with her friends, mother and even her late husband by the end. Near the end I actually thought it was going to subvert convention with something less than a happy ending but of course I'm proved wrong within about 60 seconds.So, a sort of Irish variation of ""Ghost"" then, but with a less consistent soundtrack (it's all downhill after the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl's ""Fairtytale Of New York""), less laughs but more cloying sentimentality.It's all pleasant, undemanding stuff, but at over two hours, outstays its welcome. Hilary Swank is nice enough as the reclusive Holly, I must admit I was surprised in a good way at Gerard Butler in comedic mode with tagged-on Irish accent and Lisa Kudrow reprises her kooky Phoebe persona from ""Friends"" one more time as one of the friends (no pun intended). What else can I say, the Irish Tourist Board must have been happy at the depicted landscapes but I'm struggling to say much more.At least my wife enjoyed it.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
How to process the death of a loved one,"Although this movie doesn't give us the answer as to how to recover from the pain of losing someone we love, it helps seeing that life goes on, and time helps healing. Most of all, it teaches us that we should acknowledge the pain and deal with it, not try to ignore it and move on faster than we can, but grieve and learn to blossom again.
A nice romantic comedy that deals with an important subject.
For those who love Ireland, you get to see great landscapes.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""The best movie ever made""","""P.S I Love You"" I got this movie from my friend without expecting anything since it has both of my favorite actor and actress, and I have to say I'm really glad I did because not only the story is painful yet beautiful, the acting by all of them was extraordinary! The movie was just so beautiful, it even made me to read this novel which is even more superb than the movie!Whenever you lose someone whom you love, both of them know that its going to be terribly painful!

one of the most boring films ever,"It's not about me not liking the chick flick/ tearjerker sub genre, actually I've seen a number of such films that I actually like, but this one is unnecessarily too long and boring. I suspect that the novel is good, but not very filmable. Or that the writers didn't do the job properly. Otherwise, it appears to follow the genre demands well: you have Gerard Butler, a chick magnet, you have Hillary Swank in an atypical role which she handles pretty good, you have Gina Gershon- always likable and sexy, but when the most interesting character is Lisa Kudrow reenacting her best ""Friends"" moments, than you have to ask the question: why? This film has no point. It drags itself for 126 minutes to tell you ""Life goes on.""",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
The perfect Valentine's film to watch with your lover tonight.,"So here is my Valentine's Present to my readers. A chick flick. But not just any chick flick. An incredibly good one. I don't care if you are male or female, you have to love this idea, people fall so much in love the only thing that matters is the happiness of the other person. Gerard Butler and Hillary Swank are perfect together, which is no surprise to anyone who knows their work. The supporting cast members could all be swapped out for the leads in this case, since you have a cast of seasoned professionals with their own followings. Of particular note are Gina Gershon and James Marsters, two underused and powerfully good character actors with enough talent to carry off a film by themselves. Toss into that mix the incredible Kathy Bates and Lisa Kudrow, and for icing on the cake add Nellie McKay and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and you have the perfect cast for any romantic comedy you would want to watch. Next you take some incredible scenery and photography, mix in a wonderfully romantic plot, and a director who understands the limits of his necessity, and you have the perfect Valentine's film to watch with your lover tonight. A PG-13 rating means the little ones ought to be in bed before you start, but that was probably your intention anyway, right? After all, it is Valentine's Day.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightful,"As I have never read the book, I was not disappointed. I loved the story as it played out on the screen, Gerard Butler was astonishing, a real breath of fresh air, Jeffrey Dean Morgan saw too little screen time but what he had was marvelous, and Harry Connick Jr. was amazing, his character so pitiful yet likable. I loved the idea that someone loved another so much and understood them so well that he was able to set up the whole letter trick and have it work. All in all, it was a very enjoyable film. I am looking forward to more Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The Irish scenery is beautiful and the end excellent. When it is released on DVD, I will be adding this to my collection.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I went to the theater hoping to see something that would cheer me up, and I was not disappointed. I did indeed feel better after watching this movie. I had never seen Hillary Swank in a movie before, and thought she was good (everyone else was, too). Holly's friend Denise was hilarious in the bar scenes, I was doubled-over laughing.

The movie helped me navigate my life through this difficult time. Well acted by both main stars and the cast. Holly definitely hit all the main points of mourning. The detail paid in this movie requires the viewer to pay close attention otherwise you will miss the richness of the story. However, it seems that the editing may have cut out too much. Ciara character was almost nonexistent. She is a much more interesting character simply because she's Hollys sister.

P.S.

Gerry has made sure his wife will get through her grief with his help after he has gone. Holly starts to receive letters with many exciting adventures planned. With a little help from her friends Denise Hennessey (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon McCarthy (Gina Gershon), visits to Ireland and a bit of karaoke help Holly get her life back on track. Like all good romantic comedies, there is always a good looking man to help ease the pain and this film is no exception. Daniel Connelly (Harry Connick Jr.) becomes a new friend for Holly, helping her at her time of need along with causing many problems along the way. This is a definite film for the girls, no doubt about that! The book was amazing but the film just puts the icing on the cake. The use of an Irish character (Gerard Butler), makes the film a real romance, especially the scenes between Manhattan and Ireland. These give it some depth and breaks the film up. It is a real tear jerker and crying will be a must. Cecelia Ahern (author) has done a superb job turning a book into film. I hope to see much more of her work.

I went to the movie because Gerard Butler (the preview showed him taking off his shirt - a real temptation to go see it, in itself) was in it (I'm female!) and a bonus was the actor who played his buddy from Ireland (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, I think.) The NYC location shooting was authentic; a plus and the Ireland scenes made me want to visit Ireland. The title of the movie may make one think it was sappy. It is NOT a silly, sappy movie.

Sweet start to 2008,"Finally saw PSILY this afternoon. I went in with fear & doubt as this movie was savaged to bits on Rotten Tomatoes (33% out 100). At the end of the day, those bad reviews came from overweight, divorced journalists who've forgotten the art of romance. PS is supposed to be sugary sweet, what's wrong with that? Whatever bad points there were in the film (Butler's Irish/Scots brogue - why not just set it in Scotland??)and forced comedy in places, you cannot escape the charm of not only the 2 attractive leads (no way is Swank ugly)- but the supporting cast, too. Jeffrey ""Supernatural"" Morgan was great & look fwd to seeing him in The Accidental Husband. I could also relate to Harry Connick's character where he quotes ""repelling the women he wants the most"".Plus points of PSILY:1. The reality of Holly Kennedy's situation, that neither she, or her hubby, have enough money to support a future baby and secure a bigger apt.2. Gerry's singing: Why has Galway Girl not been included on the soundtrack??3. Swank being as endearing as ever and showing to be adept at comedy. But where are those highlights in her hair that we saw in the poster?? Saw Phantom of the Opera as well. Plods along but would've been a far different affair if Tim Burton was directing. Gerry was amazingly good in the role & displaying the heroic qualities that would make him the ideal Leonidas in 300. A good singing voice, but given the operatic tone of Phantom, somehow doesn't fit in with everything else. However, in PSILY, that's quickly forgotten.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Superb!!!!,This movie has once again reinforced the idea that Hillary Swank is a undeniable force in cinema. The relationship established between her character and her husband is very powerful. In my opinion such on screen chemistry has not been matched since the Notebook. This move was a emotional ride that really made me think about my own life as I left the theater. Judging by the reactions in the movie I could tell that everybody was very much into the film.It is very refreshing to see that quality films are still being made that can stimulate ones emotions. I would strongly recommend this movie to anybody that appreciates the power of film.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One can hear the gears grinding all the way through,"Before he dies, Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler) - the pluckiest victim of a brain tumor since the stiff-upper-lipped Bette Davis faced-down a similar fate in ""Dark Victory"" - comes up with an ingenious way to continue giving Holly (Hilary Swank), his soon-to-be widow, advice from beyond the grave. He composes a series of upbeat letters to be delivered to her at regular intervals after he's gone - missives that contain specific instructions on how to pick up the pieces of her shattered world and move on with her life. You see, Holly was kind of an uptight stick-in-the-mud when they were married, and now the too-good-to-be-true, happy-go-lucky Irishman wants to loosen her up by getting her to perform karaoke, sending her on an all-expenses-paid trip to the place of his birth, and encouraging her to become a cobbler (I kid you not). But will Gerry's continued presence in his widow's life actually retard her ability to let go of the past and start anew? And does this ""Ghost"" knockoff stand a ghost of a chance of becoming as universally beloved as that earlier husband-hanging-around-after-death classic?Beyond the cringe-inducing creepiness of its premise, ""P.S. I Love You,"" based on the novel by Cecilia Ahern, is one of those annoying romantic comedies in which the women get all goofy, frisky and/or tongue-tied the moment some good-looking guy so much as steps into their line of vision. Moreover, Gerry is portrayed as such a saintly figure, both before his demise and most definitely thereafter, that we never get to know him as a real, flesh-and-blood person in his own right; instead, in order to make all the ladies in the audience swoon over his magnificent romantic spirit - one, I might add, that no man in the real world has the slightest hope of ever living up to - writer/director Richard LaGravenese has seen fit to deprive Gerry of all those flaws each of us is entitled to just for being a member of the human race - and which are truly the only things that make a character interesting in the end. And with that crucial dimension missing from the couple's relationship, we soon lose interest in Holly as well. And, of course, the movie cheats by having Gerry's illness take place entirely off-camera, so as not to disturb the light romantic tone of the piece, but it does little to make us care about the couple. The movie finally hits on some honest sentiment round about the 115-minute mark, and the story does avoid going down one painfully obvious narrative pathway towards the end, but, by that time, it's much too late to undo the damage.A large cast of well-known and talented actors - Kathy Bates, Lisa Kudrow, Harry Connick Jr., among them - do yeomen work with poorly written parts, but it's an uphill slog against bathos, pratfalls and contrivance all the way. Well, at least the Irish scenery is lovely.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

"P.S. I Love You, Movie worth Watching","The plot of this movie is about a young widow who discovers that her late husband left her 10 letters to help ease her pain and start life all over again .Hilary Swank who plays Holly Kennedy and her husband Gerard Buttler who plays Gerry are the main characters. Other characters like Holly's mother (Kathy Bates) and her two sisters Denise and Sharon (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon) appear later in the movie. This movie starts with its first setting at the couples Manhattan apartment in New York City. The director does a good job by using his camera's high angle position which makes the apartment appear very small and crowded as he introduces us to their life. He also uses a Low angle camera position making the couple appear larger in a small apartment to put emphasize on how small the apartment is. The second setting events take place at Holly's mother's bar where their friends and family meet often. This is also a setting that the director uses for Gerry's memorial ceremony as we see all his friends and family gather to bid him goodbye.The director shows us their love by focusing a close- up shot not once but many times as they kiss each other and all there is, is their faces on the screen. After suffering from a brain tumor and later dying from it, Gerry leaves behind the 10 letters distributed to different people (his friends) instructing them of when to dispatch them to his wife. The letters would come to her in an organized manner instructing her of what to do when, how and with whom. She forgets everything and starts living for the letters. Here the director focuses on her emotions as he brings to us close-up shots again when she cries lying in bed.This movie will make you smile, choke up or even wet your eyes. No drama or romance movie has ever hit home like this. You will be left appreciating life and mostly the people you care about.

emotional romantic tale,"Based on Cecelia Ahern's novel, P.S I love you tells the story of a young widow, who receives messages from her late husband, to help her move on with life.Hilary Swank (Million dollar baby) stars as central character Holly Kennedy, who is struggling with the loss of her husband. Swank portrays the character extremely well. I really felt for her character as she portrayed Holly in a depressed and lonely way.The story itself is very calm and sweet, with the occasional joke thrown in for light heartedness. It's a slow moving romantic drama which will make you feel for the central character in many different ways.It's a story about love, loss and other strong human emotions. I personally thought that the film covered the issues very well. The issue of betrayal was an interesting perspective to cover given the situations put forth.It's not as sad and emotional as it could be, but however is still emotional thanks to the wonderful dialogue and direction.Lisa Kudrow (Friends) is the funniest of all the characters with her quirkiness and sophistication playing well to the situations.Gerard Butler (300) is fantastic as late husband Gerry, who's actions after his passing are wonderful and so kind and generous for his wife, which are strong and passionate.The use of flashbacks is very good in capturing the emotions of the character's and the setting. One great moment comes when the couple first meet in Ireland, which is slightly clich√© but I personally think it's a very sweet moment in the lives of the characters.I've never read the book but after seeing the film I would like to.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

So I would say director has done his job as good as possible because it is the biggest challenge to communicate what exactly you want to say to audience and to make sure same thing reaches there, is talent.

The performances are as good as they can be, what with lazy and contrived writing; particularly Lisa Kudrow and several one-scened background characters.

PS: i don't like you very much (dvd),"Well, the movie begins well with an incredible scene of domestic quarrel between Hilary and her husband. Then, come the credits, next the grieving. That was tastefully done because we know that they are deeply in love and we don't have to live the dreadful period of his illness and death. Then, the letters arrive and i found that it was a very original idea that a terminally ill could plan his support. To my knowledge, it was the first story of this kind. The moments Hilary shares with his ""ghost"" are moving and i thought it would be a great movie.Unfortunately, the cast is not great: Bates is a dull mother, Kudrow is a pathetic man-eater, Hilary's future landlord plays too much the playboy. Only Connick is funny but their relationship is a bit absurd. Furthermore, the story drags a lot and the letters lead to nothing fundamental. The Ireland journey is exotic for the colors (i understand why it's called the Emerald Island) but nothing really happens!And the ""coup de grace"" for such an Irish movie is the absence of a U2 song, especially when the title song of Blunt copies their chorus of ""in a little while"". Aoo, Aoo, Aoooooooooo....",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Based on the superior Love Letter,"Just because a film is labeled a ""chick flick,"" it doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. But in the case of P.S. I Love You, we have past history to show how mediocre it is.Actually, the film is based (and uncredited) on Shunji Iwai's touching Love Letter - the tale of a widow who receives letters beyond the grave from her husband. It's an unabashed tear-jerker, but has a simple, unstrained narrative with an engaging central character. It's been warmly reviewed in the IMDb, and is the winner of a dozen international awards.P.S. I Love You has the indestructible Hilary Swank, but it's also terribly strained. The humor is dull, and its numerous sad moments can leave a viewer resentful. There are lots of outstanding women's films, some classics, but this isn't one of them.And while you're at it, seek out Love Letter - you'll be surprised.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bland,"One of my pet peeves is when somebody writes a film review and says ""It's not at all like the book"". Well, guess what?? That's because it's NOT the book!!!!! It's an adaptation that must condense a story premise, introduce and develop characters, create story arcs and climaxes in 90 minutes based on a book that takes many hours or days to read. If you like the book so much, maybe you would be better off NOT seeing the film.Now, for my review of this film. It's quite formulaic and predictable, has a tremendous amount of dialogue that has been stolen from classic novels and films, contains many pretentious and contrived scenes, and the casting of Hillary Swank was a huge mistake. On a rainy evening, this is a decent film to watch with your wife or special friend when it comes on HBO but strictly from a film perspective, it's not very memorable.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really bad acting and stupid plot.,"Okay, so this movie was way worse than I imagined it to be. Hilary Swank as the main character did not fit, and seemed to be a horrible actress. The romance was cheesy. The Irish accents were so bad they actually made me laugh. It seems like they all tried too hard to make the movie good, but in my opinion, they failed miserably anyway. The notes she received were stupid and weird. The characters just annoyed me though it may have been the fact that I disliked most of the women in the story. I actually didn't mind the scenes in Ireland too much mainly just because the scenery was nice. The flashbacks were too long and tedious however, and I found the acting overdone. Anyway, I would not recommend or watch it ever again. Waste of two hours.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Unreal passed off as Real,"I like fantasy movies and I like movies that are about real life.I have a strong dislike for movies that present themselves as being honest dramas and they throw in things totally from a fantasy realm. Give me fantasy or reality--I'm happy with either, but don't mix the two.That's where this fails for me. Without giving anything away, this is presented as a touching drama of love and life but throws in speculative nonsense ""preaching"" an untrue message (whether the author is deliberately trying to deceive or just wanted to make money on a screenplay, I have no idea), and it just doesn't work for me because I know it's just phony nonsense.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
An average movie.,"I don't know much about romance movies. I would also avoid watching it because it was a feeling that I had not experienced thoroughly and I thought it would create prejudices in myself.This is the place to say that I did not understand the meaning of the movie very much. I mean, it's not a very interesting subject. I have to mention that I watched this movie with my girlfriend. However, the movie failed to impress me. I mean, I didn't even know what the movie was trying to tell. Such an event has happened, but what does it mean to us, exactly? If they made a movie of a surprise I made for my girlfriend, why would anyone watch it? And regardless of what people believe or not about the afterlife, I don't think a person should cheat on their spouse in this way after they die. I think some people have no idea whether they love love or the person they love.Acting was also normal? I don't know. I didn't notice anything extra, but I don't remember anything that was grinning.It's hard to talk about stage shots. So neither good nor bad. I don't really remember. If it was good or bad, it would have caught my attention.As I wrote in the last two paragraphs, it's an average movie. I'm not a person who thinks that all love movies are empty and makes it a missionary, but I don't think this movie has much meaning either.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
I know better but...,"Well, this movie has a lot going against it ¬ñ the dialogue isn't all that realistic, the friends' interaction has the same artificiality, the plot is a little too cute. And when you throw in a slighty paunchy Harry Connick Jr, who has a 'syndrome' that makes him just a little bit obnoxious as he woos the widow Hilary, you really have a formula for a dreadful little film. And I don't know what it is with Scottish (or many other) actors who affect an Irish accent ¬ñ most of the time they come off sounding like the 'lucky charms' leprechaun, but I guess most Americans do too, so I can't really hold that against anyone.Some scenes are painful, and forced ¬ñ most notably the Lisa Kudrow scenes as she 'auditions' men she meets at social events, the drunk scenes with Hilary, and the bedroom chatter of the two main actors. And why they have Hilary walking on the Yankee dugout towards the end of the film, while Harry reads to her at the end is simply so contrived I could hardly pay much attention to what Harry was saying.But I like Hilary Swank, who at least has a film where she is a bit more feminine than we've seen her recently. And I like Gerard Butler and Gina Gershon, and most of the others ¬ñ esp Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the man Hilary meets while visiting Ireland, who actually does sound Irish, although I'm told he was raised in Seattle. And there is one really effective plot surprise as well.And I like some of the lines, and some of the scenes, and all of the Irish countryside, and Kathy Bates, who plays Hilary's mother who urges her daughter to move on with life, and and and¬Öso despite knowing better, I did enjoy this film. But it's really not all that good. But it sure is likable; even Harry is most of the time.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sex and the City in disguise,"I only really gave this movie a chance because it starred Hilary Swank- one of the better actors in the industry in my opinion. The actual premise of the film was very unappealing.As it turns out, Swank is actually quite poor and the film slops along with no real purpose or direction. Gerard Butler is tedious and the rest of the cast are just fodder who could easily be moonlighting from Sex and the City.Another movie that tries too hard to make you cry and ends up simply irritating you.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Dull, utterly dull.","The movie started out alright, but it just seemed to drag on and on. I kept thinking to myself, 'Is it over yet?' The acting was good, it was just that the movie was unnervingly slow, which caused me to continue watching it with the thought that something exhilarating was going to happen. Sadly, nothing did really happen. Others who have given reviews for this movie said it was fantastic, or a major tearjerker, this movie was neither. This film is horrendously dull, though I will say that it did have potential, much potential. Too bad no one rewrote the script, it would have been a lot more enjoyable. Also, this film was not much of a romantic type of movie, it was more of a movie that attempted to depict real life drama in an overzealous way. If you like movies that drag out for a long time, then I say watch the movie for yourself.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
P.S. I Don't Get You,"PS I love you draws the audience in, then loses them along the way. As the first scene opens, the viewer sees a young man chasing a young woman through flights of stairs, as if they were in an argument, clearly over something the man did wrong. Then the director, Richard LaGravenese, leads you into a scene that happens in most typical relationships: family talk. The couple then kisses and makes up five minutes later. What an attention grabbing introduction. He leads you right into a brawl between Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hilary Swank) when you're supposed to assume they're madly in love, hence the title. After her husband's death, Holly encounters numerous letters written by him, leading her to different locations which are meant to help her overcome this tragedy. Along the way she goes to the bar where she first met him, and instantly it flashes back to him singing on stage and meeting her eyes. However it isn't clearly stated that it was a flashback, so it became quite difficult to distinguish the differences between present and past. The film then proceeds to jump back and forth from present to past without as much as a hint or warning. One minute you assume Gerry is deceased and the next he's up on the stage singing an old Irish tune. There's no clear transition through scene and plot. While the plot was a little difficult to follow and the list of cast members could have been thought out more thoroughly. Gerry's friend from Ireland, William (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) was as close to a lookalike of Butler as you could get. In one of the letters he wrong for Holly, he instructed her to return to Ireland. As she was visiting, she ran into a guy and they have a subtle relationship. If you're at least going to set a widow up with someone new, make sure he doesn't have any resemblance to her ex. It's difficult to distinguish the two apart when they have the same accent, smile, personality and hair color. I'm thinking the director purposely made the two lovers of Swank to be quite similar, however it didn't seem to work out so well in his favor. There might as well have been only one of them with a costume change. Holly drags her best friends all around to the different locations where these letters lead her to, and you could tell each of them were getting annoyed. They were moving on in their lives and she was still holding on to her memories and old life she shared with Gerry. Holly shuts herself out from everyone else and gets consumed in her own life issues. P.S I Love You doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat or grasping on to the last word being said. The plot is mediocre and loses the audience constantly throughout the movie. The whole concept of the husband not telling his wife he's been suffering from an illness, and only leaves her with thoughtful letters that lead her to all the places they met, is a slap in the face to Holly. If someone did that in reality, hearts would be more than broken. They would be torn apart.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
From beyond the grave .. with love,"Interesting idea doesn't quite achieve its goal for me, Swank is a better actress than this material that attempts to milk the audience for every tear-drop. A bittersweet story of a widow who continues to receive letters from her dead husband (Butler) that enable her to reflect on their marriage and to close its door and embark on the possibility of a new relationship. Harry Connick, Jnr is one of those possibilities, while in the midst of his ""Grey's Anatomy"" mini-fame, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and his five-o'clock shadowed dimples is another.Gina Gershon (""Cocktail"") and Lisa Kudrow play Swank's girlfriends, Kudrow on a mission to find Mr Right who predictably ends up cracking onto only homosexuals and unavailables in a clich√©d sub-plot. Gershon was (and still is) an attractive supporting actress, once an action-man's muse (""Red Heat"", ""Out for Justice""), but has much less to do here, and seems out of place. Kathy Bates plays Swank's apparently unsympathetic mother who wasn't a fan of her daughter's rocky union with Butler.Probably too much a 'chick flick' to satisfy most blokes, it's somewhat over-indulgent in the treatment of the themes, aiming for maximum sympathy without doing enough to earn the damp eyes. More than an awkward moment or two at which to cringe and Swank shines through in a dedicated performance, but one wonders whether it was living beyond its means.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not my type,"This wasn't a bad movie I'll be honest. The acting was pretty good and the plot was unique which I appreciated. The thing I did not like is that it was intentionally sad.Why do people voluntarily want to put themselves through that emotion? When I lose someone or something unfortunate in my life happens I get sad. I hate that. I would like to avoid that but that is life. I would never seek sadness out. I could kind of say the same for horror movies. I don't like being scared so I avoid those too.That all being said, it wasn't a bad movie though if you are into being sad. The acting was pretty good. It had a unique plot. It was a little long, about 20 minutes too long.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
P.S. I Love You,"Hilary Swank is probably best known for her somewhat masculine Oscar-winning performances in the 1999 transsexual tale Boys Don't Cry and Clint Eastwood's boxing movie Million Dollar Baby (2004), so it's good to see her in distinctively feminine roles for a change. In the film adaptation of Cecelia Ahern's novel PS, I Love You, Swank plays a married 30-year old woman Holly Kennedy whose dear husband Gerry (Gerard Butler) suddenly dies of a brain tumor at the age of 35. Numb and alienated at first, Holly starts getting a grip on her life again when she begins receiving letters that Gerry had written before his demise, guiding her to open up to joy again. With her friends Denise and Sharon (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon) and sister Ciara (cute Nellie McKay), Holly follows the letters' instructions leading her to Gerry's home in Ireland among other places, eventually overcoming her sorrow.Romantic drama-comedies have frequently been aimed at the most undemanding of female audiences, but not often this obviously. The Gerry character has been written so ridiculously dreamy that it is impossible to think of him as a real person: he's self-confident, humorous, musical and even speaks with a sexy Irish accent. Since none of the other men, like Jeffrey Dean Morgan as a handsome Irish musician-lifesaver (!) or Harry Connick Jr. as the ""adorably insecure"" potential love interest Daniel, are any better characterized, all of the responsibility is shoved on the shoulders of the women. Unfortunately, the clich√©d best friends, their man-hunting tips and the subplots about their relationships provide nothing even remotely fresh or interesting. The always charismatic Kathy Bates helps a little with her performance as Holly's skeptical mother Patricia, but of course her storyline is also concluded according to the conventions of the genre. Hilary Swank herself delivers a decent performance too, but like the other actors, she isn't given much of a character to work with.If the plot is just as cheesy as the plot description above implies, so is the execution of it. Neither the score nor the song choices on the soundtrack ever even attempt a new approach to the age-old feelings they are supposed to illustrate; I mean, I like The Pogues but the filmmakers could really have picked something more surprising than ""Love You 'til the End"" and ""Fairytale of New York"" from the band's catalogue. The scenery is pretty to look at though, especially during the Ireland scenes, even if constantly gorging on the beauty of the green pastures often comes across as heavy-handedly emphasizing the irritating perfectness of Gerry's loving plan for Holly.I admit that I am not part of the target demographic of this type of movies and that they're only meant to be taken as light escapism, but I really think either a more credible, less predictable story or less hackneyed comedy would have been needed to make P.S. I Love You an entertaining romance romp. If stereotypical guys' movies objectify women as sex symbols, romance weepies like this one can be said to objectify men as unrealistic daydream teddy bears. Sure, both kinds of films are good to have at hand when you want to just unplug your brain and pass some relaxing time, but personally I was just writhing in my chair hoping for the two-hour movie to finally end. Only for the most sentimental romance fans.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing with and without having read the book,"I had watched the movie when it first came out, and the only thing I remembered was that I didn't particularly like it and found Gerard Butler miscast. Recently I read the book which I thoroughly enjoyed even though it has some flaws. So I decided to give the movie another try. It didn't improve in my opinion. Changing parts of the storyline and removing characters is understandable and I don't mind that the movie did it. But except for the names of the main characters and the basic idea (husband lets his letters deliver to his wife after his death) they changed too much about the story. They should have made use of the strenghts of the book's story, which are in my opinion on one side Holly's deep grief and her friends' and family's struggles to bring her back to enjoy life, and on the other side the characterization of Daniel as compassionate, funny and cool friend to Holly. The movie shows how Holly remembers Gerry in many situations, but it does not succeed to convey her pain and the desperation of her friends to get through to her. I also missed the character of Daniel from the book. In the movie, Daniel is an awkward guy who says the wrong thing in every situation, and Harry Connick Jr plays horribly monotonously without conveying any emotions. And why was Jeffrey Dean Morgan's character added? What does he do except for looking handsome? By the way, I didn't dislike Gerard Butler as much as the first time I watched it, but I still think he doesn't fit in romantic roles. I give the movie 3 stars because I liked Kathy Bates' and Lisa Kudrow's performances and Hilary swank was okay. But it's sad to see how much potential for a good story and proper character development was wasted.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is the Hillary I'd vote for,"Considering the cast, ""P:S I love you"" was fun and flagrant! The marriage of Hillary's character comes to an end and a series of goodbye/slash/ Have a little fun in starting your new life letters start to pour into her life as her wild and crazy Irish husband has dropped dead from a brain tumor.Sadly enough, the acting is not deep enough even with a great storyline, to carry this feature through to the end. In many movies that are stories of love or dying loved ones,lost loves etc, this one seems to not get to the point quick enough, the interaction between the characters is in it's best view simply a feeling of not being real, but just 'artificial'. Hillary Swank is swank,no doubt she is hot stuff and would be great to be married to. Hillary is, well she, what can you say she is beautiful. The only thing that held this together was her in the lead as the sexy young wife, with no kids. Even though the director didn't try to 'force' a new romance down the the viewer's throat by the end of the film, it still just goes at a non real rate. There are moments here and there but the 'real' feeling of love and loss are lost. I had no water welling up in my eyes, no teary moments at all.Not like other movies that at least you feel it coming...this was sort of a 'dud'.Sorry to those excited about this one, not everyone thinks this is a great story.All in all....not really recommended with all the other features available.

Yes, we get you're Irish, mate, but the accent and all of that.. so exaggerated and unnecessary. It's as if the screenplay read: ""just be the Irishest Irishman who ever Irished.""

"a little warning: NOT a romantic comedy, NOT a chick flick (not typical at least)","I did really like this movie, but I'm not going to write all about which elements I liked and which I didn't, because they've been covered before, and by more than one poster usually :-).However, in light of the many posters calling this a Romantic Comedy, a chick flick, or describing it using words such as 'lighthearted', 'entertaining' or 'hilarious', I wanted to reiterate that it is NONE OF THOSE THINGS.To expand: yes, there are romantic elements and scenes, there is amusing banter--flirtatious and between friends--and there are a couple of funny scenes. But for your sake, as well as to be in a position to do this movie justice by watching it when you ACTUALLY feel like watching this kind of thing, don't expect:-to laugh-out-loud like you might have in Bridget Jones' Diary in the 'getting ready for the date/party' scenes, or any makeover scene in any comedy of the past 15 years or so :-) . Here you get more of a chuckle, along the lines of what is sometimes called, in plot analysis, 'comic relief'--a little giggle to stop you loosen the lump in your throat.-Sleepless In Seattle/You've Got Mail style romance--this is more substantial stuff, more of the Titanic brand of romance (only without the epic element--it's just late and I can't get a better example :-))-any situation comedy like the karaoke in My Best Friend's Wedding-any characters that are only there to make us laugh-a 'lighthearted' movie means you don't seriously care much what happens to the characters. you mainly care what happens with the plot. Here, the plot is character-driven: you care about what happens to the characters.One last thing: no, this is not a movie to bring your pre-teen, even if they are mature-- certainly not without making sure they know they're gonna see a sad movie. Not because you see a bloke's rear end for all of two seconds some time in the movie, but because the themes this movie deals with are adult themes dealt with in an adult manner (for adult, read emotionally complex). A younger kid would just feel the sadness in it without having the benefit of knowing how to handle those feelings. Fair warning!All in all though, this is a good movie; I only object to it being classed as a RomCom, because it makes people go in with the wrong sorts of expectations (and probably keeps away people who would have liked it, because they generally don't enjoy RomComs). I think a more useful label would be what Hillary Swank (I believe) described it as: a dramedy. I mean, she should know, since she stars in it, right?!",,Anonymous,Romance
fantastic,"very well written and acted making it a touching yet uplifting story. You don't know what will happen next, it's not predictable. The sexual energy between Hilary, Gerard, Jeffery and Harry was believable. The romantic scenes were not corny or over the top and the end was the cherry on the top with Hilary meeting up with Jeffery again. The healthy flirting between all of them is welcome and reminded me of the storytelling that made my heart flutter when I watched old films. I will recommend this movie to all my friends of different ages. The filming in USA and Ireland was beautiful and necessary to enhance a romance. The conversations even touched on life issues like when they noticed the elderly couple enjoying their time in life and also when Hilary and Harry kissed and both admitted that it felt more like brother and sister - that realization was very accurately expressed: congratulations to the writer(s)",,Anonymous,Romance
