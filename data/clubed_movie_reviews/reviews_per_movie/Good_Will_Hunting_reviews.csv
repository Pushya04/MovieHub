Beautiful,"I return to this movie from time to time for the last two decades. I do not like Damon and Affleck, but this is their lifetime achievement and the most deserved Oscar they will ever win. Beautiful drama about finding yourself, finding a balance between the essence of life and its everyday appearance, about love and friendship. Realistic, unpretentiously philosophical and warm movie about life. Two main trumps of this movie are its perfect script and brilliant Robin Williams, the actor that adds warmth and love in everything he does. I can not say it's a masterpiece of cinematography, but it surely is beautiful, intelligent and it never gets old.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Its central performances are phenomenal and its inevitable emotional release is truly powerful.,"The genius of 'Good Will Hunting (1997)' isn't in its plotting or its resolution or even its character arcs per say (which are all a little formulaic or clichéd to an extent), but rather in the nuanced and realistic journey that that these almost fully-formed people take to reach the conclusions you know they eventually will. The two central performances are nothing short of phenomenal. Williams' subtly wise and humorous demeanour exudes fatherly knowledge as a man of experience and Damon's frustratingly yet understandably closed-off defensiveness makes his inevitable emotional release truly powerful. The writing rounds them off in ways which make them feel honest, imperfect and, most importantly, real. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A slow burner, a fine achievement","Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Incredible, moving movie.","A lot of things have been said about this fantastic movie, and I only hope to add a few more praises.The fact that it was written by Ben and Matt was a shock to me, I did not expect any strong writing and a solid script, but boy was I wrong. The movie lasts for 2 hours, and every minute of it I couldn't even focus on anything beside the incredible world of Will Hunting.Matt plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his unreal intellect. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will's talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship.Yes there is a girl, but this is not a romantic movie. There is more to life then what we are taught and what we have to show for it.The writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt's best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet's Society.If your looking for a typical Hollywood movie with a Hollywood ending, then do not bother spending two hours on this movie. This movie is ahead of it's time, and lands an easy 10 out of 10.This one is a keeper in my movie library.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
This movie has a brilliant script...,"It appears the jury is hung... many people either loved or hated this movie. I can tell you why I loved it. First of all the script. I think it had a real slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4 letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's because they lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion any time I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think & speak in my day to day life. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, you weren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example, William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know people like that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, ""I'll save you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect & neither are you- the question is whether you are perfect for each other."" I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some ""white trash"" as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, life and courage- courage to ante up & try again, no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning & I am sad for the people that didn't get it. As the movie ""American Beauty"" said... LOOK CLOSER.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Incredible,"I don't think I have been this moved by a movie in a while. Good Will Hunting is an incredible movie and if I had to say what I think is Gus Van Sant's best film, this would be it. It is a slow-burner, but I think this was purposefully done and it added to the film's poignancy and psychological aspect.Good Will Hunting is a beautifully filmed movie with striking scenery, and it is directed wonderfully by Van Sant. The music is never obtrusive but never too low-key either, while the story is interesting and compelling and the script intelligently written.The acting is one of the film's best assets, as well as its compellingly real characters. Robin Williams is superb in one of his best ""drama"" roles, while Ben Affleck has never been better and Matt Damon gives another fine performance to match his performance in The Talented Mr Ripley. Minnie Driver is also quite touching and believable.All in all, an incredible movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The Real Best Picture of 1997,"While everyone took sides with L.A. Confidential (for it's Old Hollywood flair and tight-as-a-girdle plot arc) or Titanic (for it's generally inescapable, juggernaut-like aura) as the Best Picture of 1997, it seems that too many people overlook Good Will Hunting for what it was:  a timeless little opus that managed to make South Boston look romantic and happened to make Ben Affleck and Matt Damon some of the most deserving superstars in recent memory.Because before they were anybody, they were just the writers of this tale of a reluctant human being named Will Hunting, a mathematical genius who wore the guise of a hoodlum, and all of the sudden obstacles he had to take on to truly step in to manhood.  Among these obstacles were a straight-forward shrink who outright dared Will to bulls*** him (played by Robin Williams, who got his overdue Oscar for it), a brilliant M.I.T. professor who felt it his own personal redemption to put Will's mind to great use somehow (Stellan Skarsgård, who never fails to steal nearly every scene he's in), and a girl who doesn't understand why the boy she loves so much cannot love her.It was these obstacles that made Will Hunting such a complex character: while he was a genius at the definite (math), he was a bit of a moron at the indefinite (human relationships).  His rough-edged exterior was simply a cry for help, and the process of which the obstacles in his life realized that and attempted *to* help him was nothing short of extraordinarily touching.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A really well made and deep film!,"I gotta say, with these great actors and the high rating on imdb, ive been really excited to watch this and i finally was able to watch this.The plot is really intriguing and very interesting. Extremely well written and acting is very well performed and feels very authentic. It really makes the viewer captivated from the start. Especially by Matt Damon, Robin Williams and by Stellan Skarsgård as always.Its a pretty deep film that explores what impact our choices, have in our life and that nothing is impossible.Very good soundtrack!Howevery abit badly filmed in some scenes, but nothing that makes a large impact on the film.I really recommend it!

A Movie About Men:  The Internal Fight Club,"Why another review? Well, for the few that might read this, I find this movie very accurate about the state of seeing a counselor. It is also very accurate about a man who carries deep toxic shame within keeping him from intimacy with others and living with massive defense mechanisms. Because of this, I understand why some do not like this movie, it taps a part of themselves they are still running from, and that is why this movie is so powerful.It is very hard to believe two 25yos wrote this script with such realistic relational depth. There are some very powerful emotional dynamics in this movie--the scene with Will & Skyler in her apartment when Will unpacks. The monumental scene with Will and Sean ""It's not your fault""--when a movie is a template for real life, this is an epic work of art! This movie allowed people to talk and relate when emotions were road blocks, to point to a scene in Good Will Hunting to establish a base for communication.Here's a point in real time. I was writing this review and a friend called. He ended up hanging up the phone on me because I questioned him about a project. He did a ""Will"" in Skyler's room on me because I tapped a dark shadow in his life. His sensitivity to being questioned is such a part of his identity he is unconscious about, but something that causes him great conflict in his marriage which is now a divorce, his inability to stay employed, and history with addiction.This movie lays a template for men's issues!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
good will hunting,"Let's compare GWH to the earlier, better ""Ordinary People"", shall we? Both are psychiatrist savior movies set in large, urban American communities that feature plenty of good acting and perceptive dialogue. So why is it then that I care deeply about Timothy Hutton's Conrad Jarrett in ""People"" and give not a cold Guinness about the title character of this film?Maybe it's because in Redford's film it mattered very much to me that a suicidal and troubled youth with a messed up home life learns to survive in the world and not withdraw from it whereas in Gus Van Sant's film, (which is really Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's film...more about this later), it really doesn't affect me in any way whatsoever that Will would rather be a janitor than an MIT math whiz. If anything, Will's shrink, well played by Robin Williams, seems far more damaged than he is, what with anger issues over his dead wife and lack of success compared to Stellan Skarsgaard and all. Perhaps if the film had focused on him, and been called ""Sean Maguire Floundering"", it would have caused me to exhibit some empathy, but, then, if it had focused on how unstable the shrink was you would not have had the therapist as healer trope so beloved by Hollywood ever since Claude Raines sat down next to Bette Davis in ""Now, Voyager"".I also did not particularly care for the lack of visual interest or flow in this film. It tended toward the closed in feel of ""prestige"" TV, like a Hallmark Hall of Fame with the F word, as Van Sant's camera continually retreats before the onslaught of Damon and Affleck's dialogue, with all the main characters afforded at least one long, self revealing monologue and Williams and Damon given more than one. And while the monologues are all intelligent and even at times funny they render the film more of a literary than a cinematic experience. Thus the Oscar win for best writing rather than best directing.Give it a B minus.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
I do not understand this films greatness,"I'd saved this for a special day when I wanted quality. Shame. Completely bizarre and unrealistic story. So contrived and stupid. It wasn't remotely believable. Just silly. The point of the entire frame was to get Matt Damon and Robin Williams in the same room. They could've saved so much time shortening it. The rest was just transport. Everything about the kids life was uninteresting. The silliest sob story. His relationship with the Harvard girl was a yawn-fest. Bad acting.I'm a liberal, so they were preaching to the choir, but even I found the long liberal speeches a bore. People don't talk like that. There's a rule in fiction... show don't tell. They forgot that rule. How did this film get nominated for nine Oscars, including best picture?!? This is first year English major level of writing. So bad dialogue. Such a weak contrived script. It tries to make some blindingly obvious points about it sucking to be poor. This is not news. Also... everybody was hot and sexy with a smoking hot body. Not believable at all. Just took me right out of it.Both me and my girlfriend sat with dropped jaws wondering how this got so high ratings. The good acting does not save this film. Yes, there's some top notch fine acting here. Both Matt Damon and Robin Williams to stellar performances. Stellan Skarsgård, who I know is a good actor, couldn't save his silly role.

The Genius In Our Midst,"So many personal projects of our best players never come out quite right. The vision they have somehow doesn't translate to the screen, or it's not box office subject matter, or maybe the actors aren't gifted with writing or directing talent. That's certainly not the case with Good Will Hunting which was not only the breakthrough film for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor.Not too much imagination was required though because these guys set this film in their native Boston the city they grew up in, the city they seem to know every nook and cranny of. They didn't even have to lose the New England accents they would have to in most of their other films.When Matt and Ben wrote Good Will Hunting the fact they were able to interest a top director like Gus Van Sant in the project should have said something before one views a frame of film. Van Sant got an Oscar nominated performance for Matt Damon and a Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams as the psychologist who counsels Damon.Will Hunting is this average lower middle class kid from South Boston who was in the foster care system and suffered a lot of abuse while growing up. He has some low level jobs, he's constantly getting in trouble with the law for minor scrapes, and he's a functioning genius who for kicks solves a highly complex mathematical equation between buffing floors at MIT.Which perks the interest of Stellan Skarsgaard highly touted mathematics professor there. He feels and I agree with him that one of the worst sins in the world is wasting the talent the Deity blesses you with, whatever it is. After a succession of therapists who are unable to cope with Damon's genius, Robin Williams gets his turn at bat.Robin Williams one of the wildest, wackiest, most innovative comics that ever walked the earth, drops all of that to deliver a highly sensitive performance as the psychologist who finally reaches Damon on some level. What Damon does with it is for you to see Good Will Hunting for.Some of that breakthrough is achieved with the help of Minnie Driver, a British student at Harvard who falls hard for the blue collar Will Hunting. Most of it is achieved though in the film's key scene as Ben Affleck tells him that no matter what your IQ is, if you don't use it and move up and on, you're the stupidest guy here. It's one of Affleck's best scenes in his whole career on film.I've known a few Will Huntings in my day, blessed with talent I would like to have had and who threw it away for a combination of reasons. One in particular I knew back in the Eighties was a kid who originally grew up in Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountain country to some really uneducated hicks. They discovered he was gay and immediately had him committed. Back in the day, they did all kinds of things to him like electroshock therapy and guess what, it all didn't work. But it left him a twisted and bitter person who gravitated to the new gay rights movement because it was something that finally validated him as a human being.He also was blessed with an incredible baritone singing voice, he could have sang opera had that been trained instead of his parents trying to change his orientation. But when I last saw him in the middle Eighties no one had or could reach him. He made a living running a cleaning service for apartments. If he couldn't sing militant songs of protest he wasn't interested, even if he could have reached millions more with his issues had he studied, learned, and developed.Unlike Will Hunting, Jimmy Flowers wasn't reached as far as I know. But Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in writing their Oscar winning original screenplay could have known him. So I'm sure they won't mind if I dedicated this review to Jimmy whether he's alive or no longer with us.I'm sure there are Jimmy Flowers and Will Huntings that we've all known and hopefully we have the wit to recognize the talent whatever it is and the encouraging nature to make people develop that talent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""Whatever blows your hair back"" - This movie does it for me!","This is the best movie I have seen since the Godfather.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck make a great team...not only as actors, but more impressively as co-writers.  Add Robin Williams in perhaps his best role ever (too close to Good Morning Vietnam for me to make the call), and you have a wonderfully entertaining movie.Ben Affleck is convincing as the best friend to a genius, able to effectively play the joker and the friend who would ""lay down in traffic for you"".  Matt Damon's portrayal of that genius realizing that life has something more to offer than batting cages and bars is equally stunning. And Robin Williams certainly leaves nothing to be desired (except maybe a beard trimmer...).The most amazing thing about this movie is the writing.  Even if the acting were not terrific, this movie still would have made my top ten list.

Two Pals Make Good in Hollywood,"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck scored quite a success with their interesting and entertaining script.  The introduction and exposition sections are enormously engrossing, after which script peaks and rather coasts along the rest of the way.  Yet, the casting is so well done, and the acting at such good level, that interest is nicely maintained.What ""Hunting"" essentially consists of is some two dozen conversational scenes, bridged together with short transitions of physical activity.  What is rather remarkable is that one isn't aware of the dramatic limitations comprising the structure.  This is a real tribute to the cast, director, and of course, the script. While the basic situation is really quite far-fetched, it is made to seem plausible--again, the mark of good, convincing writing.  The story behind getting the script sold and produced on the terms of the writers' preferences is fascinating.  Still, one can't really call it luck, for both Damon and Affleck ""paid their dues"" -- and success did not just fall into their laps.  These are two talented young men, with perseverance; and how wonderful for them to have achieved such success while still youthful and full of vitality.""Good Will Hunting"" is a good production, with solid craftsmanship in all departments -- thanks to the  creativity of Damon and Affleck.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good Will Hunting Review,"Will Hunting a janitor at M. I. T has a gift for learning, but his genius is going to waste because he can't seem to find his purpose in life.Back in 2019 I had went to Boston to see the Celtics and the Bruins, and the hotel I was staying at had a pillow with ""wicked smaht"" stitched on to it. I remember my dad seeing it and immediately saying the iconic line ""my boys wicked smaht"", and I asked him what that was from. He told me it was from a classic movie called Good Will Hunting that takes place in Boston. So, with my curiosity peaked I returned home and watched it for the first time. Since then I have seen this film 5 times and it has become one of my all time favourite films.From top to bottom this film is perfection. Matt Damon and Robin Williams give what I considered the best performances of their careers, along with two very strong performances from Ben Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard. The writing is incredible and the dialogue in particular is phenomenal. The cinematography and direction by Gus Can Sant is perfect throughout the entire film, and the music to accompany it is beautiful.What makes this film for me is that it is something we can all relate to. This film is about finding yourself and finding a purpose for your life, everyone on the planet at one point or another needed to seriously consider the question ""who am I"". That for me is an extremely powerful message and why this film is so great.10/10

"A Sensitive, Remarkable Look at Genius","Matt Damon's Will Hunting couldn't be more complex. He is an utter genius. Unfortunately, he has enough baggage to send him around the world. Will is a brilliant mathematician, smarter than many of the professors at MIT. However, he is depressed and self destructive. He gives up the minute things get hard. He can't relate to others, especially women. After many failures to help him, he hooks up with a man who respects him (but who also fears his insights) played by Robin Williams in one of his finer dramatic roles. He pushes Will and Will pushes back. The interaction between two imperfect, but brilliant, human beings is the core of this movie. Created by Damon and Ben Affleck, this was probably the best movie of the year. Will Hunting is searching for happiness, as are we all, but others have decided what that happiness looks like. He is indeed ""hunting"" for joy in his life. Excellent performances all around.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Quite good, except for a bogus ending","Barbed script full of ""F--- you's"" doesn't seem like a likely candidate for a Best Original Screenplay Oscar, but this one did win and I think the performances are the reason. The acting here is so strong--particularly by Matt Damon, who co-wrote the thing--that I believe it makes the writing seem better than it is. There are some terrible sequences that can be blamed on the script, direction and editing, such as the bit where Damon's friend Ben Affleck substitutes for him at a job interview. However, the acting usually rescues it, with Oscar-winner Robin Williams pensive and endearing as a psychologist who becomes therapist and mentor to closet-genius Damon. Minnie Driver is also excellent as an unlikely love-interest for Matt, but the finale is almost too hokey to believe. In their efforts to tie this all up with a big satin bow, novice writers Damon and Affleck sink their modest little ship just as it's about to dock.

It is not even Gus Van Sant's best film. And the title is so stupid, right?

It`s Not Good,"What is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year ) while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several awards lavished on it undeservedlyFirst off is the script . When I attended film school I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . This movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow . If you wrote an unsolicited script like this the script reader would have given up on it by page 15Structure aside the idea of a member of the American underclass being some sort of intellectual god doesn`t really ring true . Ask yourself this : If he`s the cleverst character in the movie how come he`s gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities ? Not one single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift ? Highly unlikely as is the fact he`s read so much mind expanding litrature . And if Will`s so clever how come he`s so oblivous of what happens to young good looking boys in American prisons ?But it`s the casting that let much of the film down . You want to get a couple of actors to play rough tough Irish gang members ? Let`s get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is like getting Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal do gooder . I failed to be convinced by the foul mouthed Damon and Affleck as they strutted about smacking people in the chops and couldn`t help thinking that even though they wrote the script the parts should have been awarded to different actors , after all Billy Bob Thornton has written screenplays for films he hasn`t been cast in and the same criteria should have been applied hereThere are some good points to the movie . Robin Williams is excellent as the man who tries to show Will his potential and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to stepped foot outside of Europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is quite a moving piece of dialogue at the park as Williams character explains to Will what he has seen in lifeBut I`ve got to repeat that there`s less plus points than negatives to this movie and I`ve got to agree with the people who`ve said GOOD WILL HUNTING is boring and unconvincing",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Beautiful Film About Emotional Intelligence,"Intelligence isn't how many books you can read or if you have a degree.

A Great Script And Fine Acting,"This is the film that put Matt Damon and Ben Affleck on the map, winning them an Oscar for their screenplay. It's a wonderful script about a young man with extraordinary talents whose rough upbringing undermines his opportunities.Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a polymath with an eidetic memory who works as a custodian at MIT. He lives by both his wits and his fists. Minnie Driver plays Skylar, the university student who falls for the brash young man. And Robin Williams, in an Oscar-winning performance, plays Sean, the community college instructor who dares to confront Will's demons. All three are tremendous.Damon and Affleck know Boston and they imbue the story with blue-collar authenticity. The film understands the anti-intellectualism of some of its characters (compare ""Breaking Away"") but also celebrates the upper limits of scholarship and prodigious abilities. Will is actually an anti-intellectual intellectual.This is one of the best films of its decade. There, I said it. How do you like them apples?",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"If you don't get emotional when watching the movie, you're crazy.","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Such an emotional, amazing performance by Matt Damon, Robin Williams and Ben Affleck among others. The story follows a young Will Hunting, a self-taught genius in mathematics and others. However, Will is poor and cannot afford to go to University, so he instead he works as a janitor at MIT. One day, Will cracks a math problem and his genius is discovered by the mathematics professor, Gerald Lambeau, played by Stellan Skarsgård. Unfortunately, Will gets arrested for assaulting a police officer but then makes a deal with Lambeau and has to go to court mandated therapy while studying mathematics.

James Dean buys a pocket calculator.,"A rebellious young college janitor (Matt Damon)  is secretly a maths genius, but even when it is uncovered, he seems reluctant to use it to better his life.A film that is billed as ""highly original"" is nothing of the kind. It merely lifts from a wide variety of diverse movies from Saturday Night Fever through Rocky to Love Story.  However it owes more to Ordinary People (the film best remembered - or is it forgotten!? -  for  robbing Raging Bull of the Best Picture Oscar!) than any other.Hard to really believe the central character who seems to have read lots of books and done a lot of studying off-screen (how, why and when are not fully explained). On-screen he seems much more interested in fighting on street corners, shouting at his working class friends (even when they are sat next to him), and getting clever-clever with authority.Good performance from Matt Damon in the central role, but Robin Williams as the psychiatrist who helps him (and who himself ends up helped), is the standout. Here is guy who can say more with a look than most actors can do with a hundreds lines of dialogue. Shame that even the academics seem  to swear just as readily and just as often as those lower down the food chain.Mini Driver is quite touching as an English student (rich - but not a bitch!) who catches our hero's eye. While bringing dimension to the movie, you get the feeling that this was included in case the rest of the plot flopped. It wouldn't take too much editing to make this the central theme with the rest being the background. However this was not needed.Too many good moments and too much of an engaging plot for us not be lightly charmed - but I wasn't moved by this movie. Our hero's working class friends are loyal - but that is about all you can say for them. Ben Affleck (in the ""best friend"" role) shows that haircuts, cheekbones and teeth are still what really counts in tinsel town.The sterile world of (Boston) academia and the juvenile world of the street (as portrayed here) both alienated me. Can there not be middle way for our will-he-won't-he protagonist? The movie seems just as confused on this point as I am and in the end cops out of answering it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Over-hyped Banal Trash,"What is it about this movie that people like so much? It is just a two-hour cliche, and a stiflingly boring one at that. It is essentially just a badly done and more obnoxious version of Little Man Tate or Searching for Bobby Fischer. However, the thoroughly average Matt Damon takes the part of the astounding misunderstood genius to a new level. Why? Because, get this: he's... older! Wow! What a twist! That makes it totally different!The only bright spot of this movie is Robin Williams who was cast in the sadly stagnant role of the person who just wants to help our little genius, just as Jodie Foster did in Little Man Tate, or Laurence Fishburne in Searching for Bobby Fischer. Then, we have Stellan Skarsgard in the role that Dianne Wiest and Ben Kinglsey played in the aforementioned films: the academic who is vilified for their attempts to help the genius realize his squandered potential.The only difference that this movie has from the other two I've mentioned is that the misunderstood genius is more independent and gives the establishment a lot of grief. Yeah, Will! Damn the man! Steal an idea! Take Little Man Tate, make him 10 years older and pretend it's a whole new movie!Number 28 in the top 250?

Ranked 87th on the site though it is better than at least 1/3 of films rated higher on here,"I watched this movie for the third time today and it was just as powerful to me, if not more so, than when I saw it upon its release.Gripping story and characters.Superb acting all-around.Robin Williams earned every ounce of his Oscar and his grand performance here is one of the great efforts in movie history. It's one of those roles that should be replayed every year at the Oscars ceremony along with Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca and Gene Kelly in Singin' in the Rain. Williams is not the lead actor but his interplay with Matt Damon in the key scene near the finale is one of the best film history has to offer us.As most should know, Damon wrote the script with a young Ben Affleck. Affleck's younger brother Casey has a solid supporting role as well. Cole Hauser, who acted with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in the 1992 film School Ties, has a small role but makes an impression. Hauser also acted with Ben Affleck in Dazed and Confused (1993) and I assume must be a real-life friend of both.Minnie Driver is really great in a difficult role.I have a small problem with a couple of the lines (particularly the bar scene) which I won't give away but it knocks the movie down a half point. Some parts of the story are just not believable. There is some tongue and cheek humor and a few things that might seem implausible today but were realistic in 1997.The brilliance of the writing, the youthful energy and the power of the performances (along with a great soundtrack that features the haunting songs of the late Elliott Smith) make this a landmark film for a generation - especially those who came of age in the 1990's.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Greatest Coming of Age Movie of all Time,"One of the Greatest Scripts ever, creates a story of a young man overcoming all that is against him, including himself and his past to become who he truly is, a great man. The actual best picture and lead actor of 1997. Robin Williams and Matt Damon create two of the best characters ever. Affleck and Damon's script to this day amazes at how they wrote this at such a young age. Truly every American needs to watch this to understand what Coming of age really means in our society. Very few movies understand what it means to be a man better than this one. Although it is about a guy and his journey it applies to everyone on how we can overcome, grow and need great mentors and friends to become who we are meant to be. So many heart wrecking scenes and monologues that add to a heartfelt and warming story of the ages for all.The romantic story feels so accurate to how love can be, the relationship between Matt and Robin translates so well to what a father/son or mentor/apprentice is like. The psychology side of the film is also really good. The best therapy is truly conversational, relatable, and tough at times to really get through the issues at hand. This film feels very accurate to life as well as adding a fantastical journey aspect to it as well. Not only can you relate to the characters and feel like you've been on a journey or in a relationship similar to this yet you still want to be in the movie and live through the story you see. It's an awesome balance that creates such a great movie experience.One of the best ever made and a must watch for all. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"In short, it's ace!","So great!'Good Will Hunting' is a film I had heard many a great thing about but had never actually seen it so didn't know anything about the plot - so much so that I genuinely thought it was about the good will of hunting or something... and certainly not about a character named Will Hunting! The poster makes it look like a film of that sort, in my defence.I also didn't realise, aside from the lead two, that the cast list was so stacked until the credits came up at the start. The names didn't let me down either, as the acting is superb across the board. Matt Damon and Robin Williams are truly outstanding together, I already rate them from other productions so I'm glad I can add another cracker to their respective filmographies.Even away from Messrs Damon and Williams, you've got very good displays from the likes of Stellan Skarsgård, Minnie Driver (emotionally, particularly, excellent) and Ben Affleck. Pretty impressive that it was written by both Affleck and Damon too!The plot is great, the way the friendship builds between Will (Damon) and Sean (Williams) is so beautifully done.

He has strong beliefs and is quick witted sure, but we rarely see him interact with his peers in ways that make us want to see him succeed.

An Emotionally Disturbed Mathmatical Genius from South Boston,"This movie begins with an incredibly gifted young man named ""Will Hunting"" (Matt Damon) working as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The problem with him is that he is extremely anti-social and is constantly getting into trouble with the law. Then one day he sees an incredibly difficult mathematical formula posted on a bulletin board there at the university and he writes the solution on it without any difficulty. Needless to say, the professor who put the problem on the bulletin board named ""Gerald Lambeau"" (Stellan Skarsgård) is totally amazed and immediately sets out to find the person responsible. However, when he finds Will he is totally unprepared for the emotional wreck in front of him. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I really enjoyed the performance of Matt Damon, Robin Williams (as the psychologist ""Dr. Sean Maguire"") and to a lesser extent that of Ben Affleck (as Will's loyal friend ""Chuckie""). On that note, I should probably mention that Matt Damon won an Oscar for ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" while both Robin Williams and Minnie Driver (as Will's girlfriend ""Skylar"") were each nominated for an Oscar as well. Be that as it may, although the film has some slow scenes here and there, it has a quality soundtrack and enough good drama and comedy to entertain nicely enough, and for that reason I have rated it accordingly.

Goodish Will Hunting,"I'm aware of the significance of this movie in bringing Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to prominence not only as actors but as screenwriters and watched it with a degree of expectation. However the story of Damon's rebellious, tortured working-class genius flowering in the rarefied hot-house atmosphere of Boston's Harvard University didn't quite engage me, despite some good acting.The story is implausible in the extreme, as Damon's gifted character shyly but deliberately puts himself forward to get noticed by answering a difficult mathematical problem on display in the halls of the university and then follows his difficult progress to self- awareness which he ultimately achieves through encountering burn-out been there-done that psychologist Robin Williams and a pretty but feisty Anglophile student, played by Minnie Driver.I was entertained by the movie but felt its mix of low comedy (profanity is frequent, especially when Damon gets down with his gang of fellow low-lifes which includes best mate Chuckie, played by Affleck) with heightened psychological drama didn't always convince. Naturally, Damon gets off to a frosty start with last-resort Willams and even more naturally they open up to each other before the tears really flow in one of the movie's well signposted climaxes further down the line. Ditto the obvious conclusion too when Damon finally lets his heart rule his head.It's well acted although at times it seems pretty stagy, with lots of male-bonding and man- hugs on board. Damon is believable as the gifted misfit but overdoes the angst at times. I didn't quite get Affleck as the goofy sidekick and got the impression he was cast for the part because he wrote it. Williams is good as the broken-down professor but his winsomeness and adoration of his deceased wife grate a bit by the end, Spencer Tracy he's not and while Driver is okay in her part, I didn't really feel the attraction between her and Damon..In the end, while the film engaged me enough, it did seem to me somewhat overrated and didn't quite take me fully on Will's journey to rehabilitation and spiritual redemption.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Genius yet broken - A redemption story,"Good Will hunting is a story about a man who comes from a poor background but has an extraordinary brain. The movie takes you through the redemption arc of this broken character who despite being a genius and being given an opportunity to improve his life, keeps on self sabotaging in order to push away people. The movie no doubt deserve the praise and hype that it gets from the ones who have already watched it.Since the movie is a cinematic classic and is often cited as a reference for how therapy should be done, I had some idea of what to expect. While I would have preferred it to be a little more like ""The pursuit of happyness"" or ""Forest Gump"" since that is my preferred genre, I must say that it did not disappoint. The movie does not have generic motivational scenes that are expected out of a movie which is trying to showcase a redemption story, scenes like the underdog feeling down and eventually getting up on their feet but what it lacks in the motivational aspect it makes up for it by discussing the existential element and really makes people think and self introspect.One of my absolute favorite scenes is when Sean (The therapist) tells Will(Matt Damon) that it's not his fault that his life is so messed up and to that Will reply that he knows, after that Sean repeated the same thing that its not his fault and Will replied that he knows but Sean kept on repeating the same thing and it is then when we see that the smug guy who has been tough throughout the movie starts crying like a little baby as if that's exactly the validation he needed. This scene made me tear up a bit as well.In conclusion, an amazing movie to watch, It might not motivate you to immediately get out of bed and start doing work if you are having a gloomy day but nevertheless it does help in lightening up your mood and gives a very powerful message - ""Acceptance is the only way forward"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The genius in the crowd,"I have to admit that I rarely had been moved or deeply touched by a movie, but GOOD WILL HUNTING is one of the few movies that has this power.

Gus Van Sant's direction is near perfect, and the outdoor sets are all nice to look at.

Stellan Skarsgard is also great as the Maths professor at University. Minnie Driver (Hunting's girlfriend) is also adorable and believable.

Robin Williams steals the show,"It's taken me 25 years to finally get around to seeing this film. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have both become huge stars. And Robin Williams has tragically left us. As time has passed, different aspects of the film become more noticeable.Without a doubt, it is Robin Williams that makes this film special. The almost bottomless empathy he brings to the role of Sean connects directly to the audience's emotions.Minnie Driver is also excellent as the ""love interest"", Skylar. She brings energy, heart and believability to a film that is otherwise quite downtempo.The script - famously co-written by Damon and Affleck - is good, and particularly effective when characters are exploring their vulnerabilities.But there are weaknesses. Damon's Will is one-dimensional, and moving beyond his petulance seems to be a switch that gets flipped, rather than any kind of character development. It doesn't help that he is rather unlikeable - certainly not as likeable as Williams' and Drivers' care for him suggests.Affleck and the rest of the ""salt of the earth"" Boston friends are also unbelievable. This is a student's view of a townie, where drinking and fighting and swearing and repairing cars is all they are capable of doing.Without Williams and Driver, this could have been a very disappointing film.

Although I admit she is not the most beautiful woman in the world, she is incredibly beautiful in a very natural way, and I'm sure that the none of the Hollywood actresses could have gave a performance like she did in this film.

Thoughtful Warm Film,"For the longest period of time I never understood the title of this film. Was it about someone on some Diogenes style quest? Or was was it about someone who scowers thrift stores? Well, it has nothing to do with good will or Goodwill, it's about a young man called Will Hunting. He's a(somewhat unrealistic)genius who can solve math problems that baffle the world's greatest minds and knows twice as much on any subject covered in a Harvard class...yet he works as a janitor. A professor at MIT stumbles across and sets him up with a therapist, who tries to counsel Will while drilling to the core of his problems.The film might be centered around Matt Damon, who gives a deep performance, but Robin Williams claims every scene he's in and is the most memorable thing from this film. As you probably know, the picture also features Ben Affleck in a limited role, through which he still makes his talent evident. But while Damon, Affleck and William's may have been good choices Minnie Driver certainly wasn't. Who thought of her for the role or what they saw I'll never know.The backstory behind the script is so well known that I won't bother going over it; all I will add is that Affleck and Damon didn't do to bad a job for a first time and recieved a merited Oscar for it.Good Will Hunting is a thought provoking film and that's why so many enjoy it. It's a film that actually tried to be more than cheap entertainment and it succeeded.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Solid.,"Good Will Hunting is a very solid and quiet film. I just finished watching it for the second time on DVD and was more impressed by the screenplay than I was the first time. I thought the first time I saw the film it was only Van Sant's direction that held it all together. The movie is just well written and well directed. I think the casting was good, although I don't think Ben Affleck does a very god job in this film. Robin Williams deserved his Oscar, although a big part of me still thinks it belonged to Robert Forster for Jackie Brown. Matt Damon is very good in the lead role. I particularly like the scene toward the end when Matt and Robin's character's open up. The emotion is overwhelming and that is some great acting. The rest of the cast is good too, and Gus Van Sant's direction is powerful. Great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A wonderful movie with sensational writing,"Good Will Hunting is a marvelous movie in a lot of aspects, but the ones that are clearly the best are the acting of both Matt Damon and Robin Williams, along with a excellent script written by the dinamic duo Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. It is a strong and beautiful story about a very troubled young-adult called Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Snark Hunting,"I admire films that shoot high and miss. But it really rankles me when a film pretends to shoot high, avoids doing so because of lack of talent, and lies to us in the process.There's great drama in the mere existence of an idiot savant. These are people who often are intolerable socially, inadequate in common thinking skills, and generally lead a cursed `elephantman' life, except for their celebration as (in this case) mathematicians. Instead, we're given a watered down likeable homeboy who has been abused. Oh and he has a photographic memory which is a separate pathology (the two never coincide). Depth discarded.There's truly deep drama in the mathematical problems good Will would be dealing with. But this would require a Nabokov, and his mastery of metaphor. Instead we get the koolaid version for dummies in some (as it turns out) meaningless scribbles and a bubble diagram. Depth is twice discarded. Believe me, this could be played up big; the power of a christ in some of the insights that are speculated -- the voice and eye of God.There's also common, but good drama in the dedicating of one's life to their gift at great personal sacrifice. We actually have some good films in this regard concerning musicians. Math is better since you don't even get the applause. Here the guy with the insights but lack of language would be codependent martyr with the expert in the formalisms but no vision. But too hard, so pass.I can attest that there are cinematic depths to be mined at NSA, MIT, even Southie in terms of the absolutely unique and strange feel of the places. How could this film have missed those dark assets and end up so totally without atmosphere?This movie got made for one reason only: Robin Williams saw a part for himself. Therefore, the previously described  ignorances are filled by an amplified  backstory so Williams can find himself after losing his wife. Pretty damned offensive given the possibilities. I predict that someone will do this story (or something like it) well sometime before I die. It's just too rich, and we do have some bright minds available. Its just not these two kids.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""That boy is wicked smaht.""","If there is any film that you can call ""perfect"" it's this one.SYNOPSIS:
Will Hunting (Matt Damon) seems to have everything you'd want from unparalleled intelligence to incredibly loyal friends to the most loving girlfriend, but even with all of this Will still keeps a wall between him and everything he cares about. A life that would appear to be so simple, is in fact a lot more complex than it seems.DIRECTION:
Gus Van Sant directs this thing to near perfection. Through his direction there is so much life and grounding added to a story that otherwise seems quite plain. Knowing at which points to change the focus of the camera from one character to the next. Knowing when to hold a close up to really cease a beautiful scene and capture the expression. Now, I'm not going to sit here and act like no one else could've directed this film, however, a film like this could've easily been ruined by poor directing and editing. Great work.WRITING:
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really knocked this one out of the park. Not only was both of their acting on-point, but the dialogue in the film is so pure. There are so many memorable moments in this film just from incredible dialogue. It feels as if there's not a single line in this film that goes unnoticed or should be cut. If the heart could write a script I'm pretty sure this screenplay is what would be the result. This film definitely deserved the Best Original Screenplay Oscar that it won.ACTING:
It's not your fault. It's not your fault. I swear Robin Williams had me screaming ""I KNOW, SEAN!"" followed by aggressive tears from the guilt I felt that I never actually had a reason to feel, but damn you Robin Williams. On top of that, Matt Damon, how dare you memorize ridiculously intellectual monologues like the one at the Harvard Bar scene and the one that cut from you being at a job interview with the CIA or whoever to you being seated in Sean's office. I'm starting to feel this is an autobiography. Are those just books? I don't know. Shut up. Then moving on the Ben Affleck who is my dream best friend. One I can confide in and a man who will willingly go to my job interviews in an over-dramatic BAHSTON accent acting as a pretentious. Yes, please! Minnie Driver. That heartbreaking scene over the phone... ""I love you."" Say it back... SAY IT BACK, WILL! What a killer Irish accent by the way. Not an Irish bone in my body, but trust me... killed that accent. Stellan Skarsgard, I understand how much you care for him Stellan, but he doesn't want to be a damn mathematician. Do you know how easy it is for him?! DO YOU? And Casey Affleck, stop worrying about your damn double burger. I do have to acknowledge how resourceful you were with that baseball glove though. *Tips the hat*
I realize I just pretty much reiterated lines from the film, but the acting is so damn good that I don't even know what else to say. It's so amazing. I will say this film does possibly have the worst performance of anyone ever, however. Professor Lambeau's assistant. He looked and sounded like he was continuously trying to put himself asleep during every scene he's in.CONCLUSION:
This is my favorite film of all time. Though the directing is anything to go crazy about, the writing and the acting in this film, elevates this film to an entire different dimension for me. I can watch this film on repeat 24 hours a day. Actually, make that like 16. Sleep is essential to get another productive 16 hours of Good Will Hunting. That's my review.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A genius kid from the streets conquers Harvard..,"I must say I really found this film very over-rated. First of all the story isn't even remotly credible. How can a street kid without any education solve mathematical puzzles that even professors at Harvard University can't work out ??? Albert Einstein is mentioned several times in the movie as a parallel to Will Hunting, but don't forget that Eintein said, that to become a genius, you need 2% inspiration and 98% transpiration. What makes it even worse is that Will not only masters mathematics but history, literature, chemistry etc. as well. To me, Will is much too much of a Superman, and I couldn't identify with him in ny way. I really believe that you have to strive hard to obtain knowledge and education, and the genius myth that lies behind this film I find totally ridiculous.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

When You Find That Perfect Film . . .,"This long-time cinephile finally got herself an IMDb account, so let's discuss my favorite movie of all time.Good Will Hunting is the one and only film that I genuinely will not shut up about once you get me started on it. I saw it in its entirety for the first time when I was fourteen and have carried its story and themes with me ever since. No movie has ever touched me as deeply as this one. From its careful approach to its honest execution, there is nothing at fault.What really separates Good Will Hunting from other films and ultimately propels it forward is its brilliant screenplay combined with the commanding performances at its center. Damon and Affleck's writing is witty, poignant, and simply flawless from start to finish. The tonal shifts between bits of comedy and intense drama are so well balanced. There are quite a few monologues throughout, yet they never feel overbearing as a viewer because all of them come from a place of truth as well as dedication to the characters at hand. A script this perfectly crafted could have very easily been mishandled by the wrong actors but thankfully, the whole cast brings out everything the writing asks of them.The late Robin Williams in his Oscar-winning role never ceases to mesmerize me, and it remains my favorite performance of all time. No one captures authenticity quite like Mr. Williams does, and there is a certain profoundness to his work in this film that I honestly believe cannot be taught or replicated. Everyone knows about how powerful the park bench scene and the ""it's not your fault"" scene are, but another one that I have always adored is when Sean is telling Will about the day he met his wife. The range of emotions that Williams portrays -- from initial nostalgia, to sheer exuberance, to quiet sensitivity -- may honestly be the most outstanding bit of acting I've ever seen.Aside from him, a performance and character that I believe doesn't get enough recognition in this movie is Minnie Driver as Skylar, who is also the only woman in the main cast. I find that stories told from male perspectives often portray their female love-interests as one-dimensional, lifeless characters whose only purpose is to give the protagonist a romantic relationship. They add little to the actual plot and have little to do just in general. But despite Good Will Hunting being from a man's point of view, the character of Skylar feels fully realized. Driver is exceptionally raw and engaging throughout, specifically in the climatic scene between her and Damon. Beyond her magnetic performance, the script allows for Skylar to be a lovable and charming presence on screen, making the relationship between her and Will that much more refreshing.Good Will Hunting also does not take the easy way out in exploring its themes, especially the causes and effects of mental illness. The movie actually never goes into full detail regarding Will's past, but it doesn't need to. Every decision he makes is rooted in the trauma he experienced as a child. His resistance to self-improvement, the stubbornness behind his ideologies, the way he pushes people away just as they start to get close -- everything can be traced back to the memories he refused to face before meeting Sean and attending therapy. The way the film progressively uncovers his story and perspective is incredibly well done, and a perfect model for character studies.I could go on and on. This is one of those movies that everyone should take the time to see in their lifetime. It's rare to be so moved by a film that its stays with you your whole life -- Good Will Hunting is that film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good Will Hunting is a wonderful drama about the talented young mathematician Will,"Good Will Hunting is a wonderful drama about the talented young mathematician Will. A superb cast, surprisingly it's one of Matt Damon's best acting works. And of course, a wonderful game by Robin Williams. A Good Will Hunting drama that exists and will exist beyond time, it will always be relevant. Good Will Hunting is a prime example of demonstrating people's self-reflection. Throughout the film, 2 societies are opposed: the intelligentsia societies led by Gerald Lambeau and the societies of ordinary friends with Chuck. The finale of Good Will Hunting is excellent, Will chose love after all, which only happens 1 time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The scenes between the therapist (Robin Williams) and Will Hunting (Matt Damon) are all brilliant, and the one in which he breaks through by repeatedly saying ""It's not your fault"" never fails to make me emotional.

"pretentious, whiny genius","What is so good about this film? I hated this film with so many reasons. The hero,Matt Damon is a handsome genius with early life trauma,so he is allowed to do anything and using foul language and fist fighting and all that gives him extra charm. But he seemed like either a complete hypocrite or a artifice-made-to-plot to me.  If all he wanted in life was getting drunk and fight why did he choose to work in the university(what a convenient place to be noticed for the sake of story) as a janitor in the first place? Why not burger king? With the vast knowledge and deep insight in politics, economics and psycho-analysis, why wasn't he able to get over with his own problem?And that counselling session, learn-from-each other and klick!problem solved!!! No, it's so schematic and unconvincing as the whole film. I totally agree on the user comment(what an arrogant...) During the film, listening to their ping-pong talk, I thought of Forrest Gump. Despite all the flaws and non-sensical coincidences, I think Forrest Gump is a very moving film. If you ask the differences of the two films, I would say:surrealism vs pseudo-realismrunning(release of freedom,metaphor of advance, hope)vs talking(do you know what you are talking about?)Ideal simpleton and whiny, pretentious genius.Should've watched on big screen, wouldn't have watched on video.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Promising screenwriting debut but an overrated movie.,"A good piece of screenwriting by young cast members Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but one that I don't think will stand the test of time. Matt Damon's (Will) performance as the troubled working-class genius in need of guidance is excellent. However, I think that this was too much of a feelgood movie and an endorsement of counselling, for it to be a truly great film. I found Minnie Driver's (Skylar) expressionless English accent thoroughly irritating and it destroyed, for me, the possibility of the romance between Will and Skylar being interesting.The performances of Robin Williams (Sean Maguire) and Stellan Skarsgard (Professor Lambeau) are good. The patient-therapist relationship between Damon and Williams is played well by both actors. The films flaw is that it lacks real depth of characterisation. There is a good story in this movie, but it lapses into classical Hollywood slushiness with all ends tied neatly together. Some characters, such as the pseudo-intellectual student who Will runs rings around while chatting up Skylar and a friend, are pretty one dimensional as he is someone we can easily mock and despise, just like the lapdog (what's his name?) who follows Lambeau around.There are few profundities in this film and I find the idea that therapy is what is needed to help a troubled young prodigy out of his predicament rather spurious. We are also shown how Will's initial hostility to therapy as part of his probation is surrendered. While one would not wish Will to remain an angry young man with no direction, I find the belief that therapy can necessarily mediate the relationship between an individual and society too hard to swallow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Timeless amazing movie,"I just finished watching this movie. I watched it in 2023 for the first time. It led me to here, to download the app, make an account, search for the movie, just for me to leave this review!! You rarely find such a captivating movie that mirrors real life struggles so well as this one does. Matt Damon plays the role splendidly, and I don't need to add anything more about Robin Williams, he was a breath of fresh air between actors. The fact that the writing was done by two very young actors that also play the biggest roles, just blows my mind. That's how you can tell they worked their assess off to be as good as they are at what they do. I obviously recommend it. Again, AMAZING!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Manipulative but well done.,"How many handsome mathematical geniuses working as janitors and whose ambition in life is to get drunk and get into as many fistfights as possible have you ever met in your life?The main problem with Good Will Hunting is that the main character is as believable as Godzilla or Forrest Gump: it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to swallow Will Hunting's behaviour and motivations. At least Forrest Gump was a nice guy: Will Hunting's attitude, which is supposed to be the product of an abusive upbringing and therefore ""not his fault"", gets on your nerves after a while. Sure, it's satisfying seeing poor Will defy the establishment figures (judges, psychiatrists and snob rich college students) and getting away with it. For a while. Too bad this get boring after a while, with the viewer always ahead of the story until the predictable finale. But as long as you don't think too long about the implausibilities of the movie's setup, the story is convincingly acted and reasonably well-told, though director Gus Van Sant doesn't show any of the offbeat touches that marked his earlier efforts (the closer he gets here is a weird slow-motion courtyard fight).Robin Williams is fine as always, and more restrained than usual; the rest of the cast is adequate, though I would have loved to see more of Stellan Skaarsgard's math professor, easily the most interesting character.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Not only were Will and Chuckie endearing characters, every one else in the film conveyed a smooth and natural performance. Even Minnie Driver proved she could fit in her role as Skylar.

Honorable performance,"The fatherly figure performance that Robin Williams encapsulates is breathtaking; with a trusting warmth and glow to his character. The working class lifestyle Will lives by is conflicted by his vast knowledge and abilities which he must address to progress with his life. Will being someone of weak character suffers from opening up to new people in his life and would rather confide to the loyalty he has already established with his life long friend - Will is portrayed a relatable character, one who fears revealing his true emotions.

Robin Williams, as his therapist, peels back the layers with a quiet strength, teaching us that the hardest battles are often fought within.This isn't a movie about solving equations. It's about solving the self. Its dialogue lingers, its lessons cut deep, and its humanity feels earned.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Great character-driven storytelling and performances,"A young maths genius visits a psychologist to avoid a prison sentence.This is a very good drama with great interactions between characters.The plot is very focussed on Will Hunting and what might become of him. I think it depends how much you care about this character, his love life, and future as to how much the film engages you.Personally I think the scenes between Will and Dr Sean Maguire are the strongest, as both characters are explored brilliantly and include excellent performances from Matt Damon and Robin Williams. All the acting in the film is strong, but Williams stands out for me.I like the scenes involving Will, Chuckie and the other guys as they feel pretty realistic portrayals of young lads in working class neighbourhoods. I can identify with a fair bit of it. That's not to say they are particularly likeable characters, but they feel like real people.One of my favourite scenes involves Will attending a job interview with a certain government agency and includes a good monologue delivered well by Damon.The law of average suggests there are likely to be people with this type of ability and potential in the world that go unrealised because they receive no help or live within social constructions that make life difficult. This is the most thought-provoking aspect of the story for me.The love interest scenes are pretty good as far as these types of arcs go, but do not interest me as much as the rest of the plot. Minnie Driver is on good form, but as someone who has witnessed many relationships fail when couples get together at a young age, I find it hard to get that invested in how it will turn out. The ending is typically Hollywood, but is central to Will's character development.Visually it is excellent, with cinematography that enhances the great dialogue exchanges between characters. The Boston locations are used fantastically well. Everything is enhanced by good editing and music. It shows you can make a riveting film without a huge budget and spectacle.It is an 8.5/10 for me but I round upwards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Respectable, Not a Classic Though","The movie examines a concept that a lot of people can probably see happening in the real world and I think this allows people to connect with it more. There's no doubt there are people out there who likely could have produced brilliant ideas for the world but were born into circumstances that made it impossible to achieve their potential.Good Will Hunting gives us a well acted movie with a star studded cast to present this idea. It is entertaining and enjoyable early on with some well expressed dialogue, but it eventually becomes very repetitive and stalls out. At a certain point it feels like you are just bouncing between storytelling from Will's friends, his therapist , and his mentor. Each story on their own is compelling with lessons to be learned , but when they just continually keep being stacked one after the other the story of Will's character growing and development is a bit lost. So much of it is spent listening to other people's opinions on Will's situation that I don't really get to see what Will is making of it all, which is really what it's supposed to be about.Overall it's decent, but I can't place it in the 'classics' grouping of movies it normally gets cast into.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The Title Really Sums it Up (In a Dreadful Way),"I'm one of the few people not crazy about this movie. I always have this problem with older, iconic movies. It feels like I've seen this type of thing better before, but I'm never sure if that is because this movie started it. In the case of Good Will Hunting, it's kind of old, but not old enough to create the old clichés.This is the story of a young, genius janitor, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who has issues. Growing up in south Boston is hard and all that, and Will was given a gift he didn't ask for, and a life that he's unnecessarily proud of. His little reality is shaken when he meets a psychologist (Robin Williams) who matches his life, and a woman (Minnie Driver) who matches his wit. And you get the dreadfully punny title, Good Will Hunting.Maybe it's the pun that gets me off to a horrible start. The screenplay doesn't make me feel much better. It is filled with clichés. It seemed like every little life lesson was spelled out for you, as if you couldn't be trusted to distill it from the movie yourself. Every little thing Robin Williams says feels like a ridiculous monologue by an amateur. Which really is what this is. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote the screenplay, their first. I really have no idea why it won best screenplay at the Oscars.The acting is very good, however. Ben Affleck isn't always convincing, but he's got that whole look and atmosphere of a hometown boy. Minnie Driver is spectacular. She really captures the emotional turmoil her character is put through. Gus Van Sant directed this film, and despite the simplistic dialogue that is put forward as the most important part of the movie, he rescues it. The silent parts are often the best, like when the boys ride back from Harvard, and soft Elliot Smith music plays. That was the first transcendental moment, and a few more follow, elevating the movie to a place it really wouldn't be otherwise. Although I had problems with the Elliot Smith-dominated sound track. Every time something was supposed to be touching, they played Elliot Smith. It was tiring and monotonous, and by the end, I could basically start singing the music before it came on.It's not a bad movie, it's just rather corny, rather predictable, rather run-of-the-mill. I suppose that the story is a bit different, and showed people something they had not seen and considered. Matt Damon's character is a bit of an enigma, a genius who shies from his gifts, and the reason why he makes sense. It's a great character study. But his ""salvation"" from his self-designed fate, is commercial and forced, and makes too many decisions and judgments to be really great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Extremely dissapointing,"I can't understand why people like this film.The basic concept was great, but it could have been SO much better.It fails on many levels:1:  The basic story makes no sense.  Will Hunting is shown to possess not just intelligence, but extreme awareness of a vast, VAST body of literature. He can quote obscure books in psychology, economics, art, etc etc etcHere's a news flash:  this kind of knowledge doesn't come from innate intelligence, it also requires incredible amounts of reading. So when did Will supposedly do all this reading?  we see him depicted as a working-class goof-off who spends his time carousing with his friends and getting into fights.  Sorry, but that doesn't compute.  At all.2: The direction and editing is terrible.  All of the key moments go by as if they weren't even important. The end of the movie just leaves you saying, ""Huh?.....""But my, aren't the lead actors good looking? That, and the superb performance by Robin Williams are all that can be said for this amateur effort.   But what do I know....",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Then another professor said, maybe there is something more important than the medal in life for him. It really moved me a lot. Sometimes one thing that everybody persuit does not suit for you. The most important thing is to find what you really want from the bottom of your heart. It is no matter your ideal is great or not. As long as you have a dream and try your best to make it, you are a successful person.Through this year I have been asking myself who am I, what is my ideal, what is my dream life. What kind of person do I really want to be? Always no answer. It is the first time that I finally start to think about myself seriously instead of just going for something that everyone is going for. But I find that. The more books you read, the more knowledge you take in, the more you can find yourself in them. I hope I can keep this up, reading and travelling. See the world and find myself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
It's never too late for a new start on life,"Will Hunting (played by Academy Award Winner Matt Damon) has a brilliant mind. He can solve any equation and loves to read school books, thus he is very smart. He is also there for his friends, particularly his best friend Chuckie (played by Academy Award Winner Ben Affleck). But he is also very young and reckless. After one too many brushes with the law, Will is placed in jail, but he is offered a way out: study mathematics while his professor (played by Stellan Skarsgard) tries to get him job offers and he will get psychiatric help. After going through many psychiatrists, he finally meets his match in Sean Maguire (played by Academy Award Winner Robin Williams). Whilst doing these math problems and going to appointments, he also meets a beautiful young woman named Skylar (played by Academy Award Nominee Minnie Driver). All of these people are amazing people who are there for Will. The question is: Can he figure out his own problem before he pushes them all away?This is a beautiful movie. Plain and simple. The editing...the music...the song ""Miss Misery"" by the late great Elliot Smith...there are so many things that are worth mentioning here. But let's start with the writing. I said that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck won Oscars in their career. Well, it was for this movie and it was for their writing skills. This is the movie that put both actors on the map and they have done it in a way that nobody else has ever done. There is a lot of swearing in this movie, yes, but it is essential to the story. It's an amazing thing, the writing in this movie; they were in their twenties and they both wrote this movie as if they had been doing this for a long time. An Oscar that was well deserved.Also worthy of praise is the great Gus van Sant. While he hasn't directed a lot of films, two of the three that he is well known for show his greatness as a director (Every director has their own personal ""Psycho"" remake, unfortunately). While he was also nominated for his direction of ""Milk"" in 2008, it's this film that shows his strengths as a fine director. He knows what to do; he is a hands-on director. One such example of his hands-on approach is the painting in Sean's office. That painting was painted by van Sant himself. It is just a small but vital example as to how van Sant knew what he was doing. Honestly, he should have gotten the Best Director Oscar that year.Speaking of well-deserved Oscars, let's talk about the cast here. The two main cast members that were not nominated for Acting Oscars - Ben Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard - both do an outstanding job nonetheless. If Ben Affleck's movies have convinced you that he can't act, check this movie out. Without a doubt, he pulls it off. And Stellan Skarsgard pulls it off as a professor who just wants to see Will succeed wherever he's at. But let's face it: there is a reason why Damon, Williams and Driver got nominated for Oscars. They are the true standouts here. Driver is so much more than just a girlfriend to Will; she has her own backstory and, although it is only briefly mentioned, you can tell that it is an important moment in her life - a moment that has defined her. Driver definitely should have gotten that Oscar. Damon is also amazing in the main role; there are a couple of scenes where he gets to me, particularly one where he truly reveals what has happened in his past. When he reveals what has happened in his past, it is very clear as to why he acts the way he does - why he pushes people from his life. Damon portrays that inner conflict very well in a role that should have landed him his first Acting Oscar (no disrespect to Jack Nicholson, though).However, the standout performance is that of the late great Robin Williams. A lot of people remember him for his comedic roles like Mrs. Doubtfire, Aladdin and Good Morning Vietnam. Some remember him for his dramatic roles in Dead Poets Society, The Fisher King, One Hour Photo and Insomnia. Some remember him for his adventurous roles in Hook and Jumanji. But this...this is my personal favorite performance that he has ever done. He is able to tone done his crazy antics for the most part, but when he does up the crazy a bit, it is certainly viable to the scene. But that park bench scene and a certain scene towards the end are my two favorite scenes that he has ever done.While I spent a lot of this review giving credit where it was due, I do have to end off by saying: Thank you, Robin. Thank you for all the magic that you have given us. Thank you for the laughter, tears and smiles that you gave us through your amazing performances. I am truly sorry that you could not find that joy within yourself, but I hope to someday see you up in Heaven with God and the rest of His Angels.

I'll get destroyed but I had a lot of issues with this movie,"This was a well-written movie and obviously well-acted. But a lot of the plot made me shake my head.Also, in retrospect I've grown weary of Matt Damon as an actor, he really can't act outside of his own personality. So despite originally his acting in this movie was amazing, seeing him in 100s of movies since, not so much now. He's just not a great actor.My main issues were with the whole concept of a savant who seems to be naturally gifted in understanding everything you can read in a book. It just didn't seem plausible. I know, I need to suspend disbelief. But I just couldn't.Learning takes repetition and exposure. Most child prodigies turn out to be monsters because instead of learning how to deal with people they learn Mandarin and how to play the piano. It's a zero sum game. We don't have unlimited capacity to learn things. Especially not ranging from economics to math to organic chemistry.The worst was when he handed in some math assignment and the professor says ""I see you used Greene's theorem here"" which is a well-known theorem to advanced math. And Damon replies ""oh is that what it is?"". I just lost it. As if Damon invented the theorem on his own, LOL. The irony is Damon apparently can memorize some obscure economics book down to the page number, but he has no concept of Greene's Theorem as a math genius? Picture him working on a car and someone saying ""I see you used a wrench here"" and him replying ""is that what it is?"".Then he says he knows organic chemistry? Seriously? Org Chem ain't that hard, but neither is remembering all the pages in the NYC yellow pages. It's just a lot of work for no reason. Why would you learn organic chemistry? LOL.It was just beyond ridiculous and I couldn't get past it. I rolled my eyes a lot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Robin William's is great. The rest of the film is average,"'Good Will Hunting' is a film of two halves for me. There's loads of fairly uninteresting 'buddy scenes' between Damon and Affleck, and any scene involving Minnie Driver's character is a write off, but in the middle of all of that dross is an amazing performance from the late, great Robin Williams.His scenes with Matt Damon are so good. In fact if you could go on You Tube and watch only those bits I'd suggest it. Williams remains the warm and funny legend that we've seen in his comedies, but here he is also slightly more guarded and restrained. The poetry of the dialogue and his delivery all match up to make for some lovely moments.It's just a shame that they appear in an uneven film, that is F-bomb heavy and at times slow.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Good will hunting,"""Good Will Hunting"" is a deeply moving drama that explores the complexity of human emotions and the struggle for self-identity. Matt Damon shines as Will, a young janitor at MIT with a hidden genius for mathematics but burdened by a troubled past. The film's strength lies in its authentic portrayal of relationships, particularly between Will and his therapist, played by Robin Williams in an Oscar-winning role. The screenplay, penned by Damon and Ben Affleck, is sharp and heartfelt, blending humor with intense emotion.

Good Will Hunting - A gem of a movie,"Matt Damon and Robin Williams are the perfect pair, and for a movie that was released in 1997, it really holds up!This story hits home for me specifically, which is why I give it such a high score, but is definitely not the only reason I rated it so. One of the best examples in film of well executed character development, not only in the role of Will Hunting (Matt Damon) but also for Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Will is a unknown genius, working as a janitor at a local university. He suffers with many different problems that are focused on throughout the film, building beautiful connections with other characters. The intensity in some of these scenes are just breathtaking, creating almost a sort of discomfort, but in a good way if that makes sense.

Entertaining piece of sentimental Hollywood tosh,"A rags to riches story where a working class boy is a mathematical genius who prefers a working class existence of bar rooms, fights and ball games to an academic life.  However when he is discovered by a professor at a trial for public disorder he is released into his care to have tuition and therapy.  Sean Maguire is brought in for the therapy while Will and his friend Chuckie go on with their normal lives.This is a quite hyped film (the rise of scriptwriters Damon and Affleck was already along the way before this hit - there's is not quite a rags to riches story for them), however there is much to enjoy here.  The story never fully explains how Will came to develop his talent or even how he came to know about it - was he born knowing everything about maths?  You feel that Will could have been given a little less arrogance - nobody knows everything.  However the story is quite interesting and it's given such a fairytale gloss that details are not important.The script also gives Williams a chance to do yet another tear-jerker role and get an Oscar for his troubles.  Affleck and Driver are also good in support but Damon is the lead.  His character has layers and he does have plenty of good scenes, but the main problem is that his arrogance is not shown as a negative trait and it tends to make him a little unsympathetic.Overall a good piece of Hollywood fairy tale gloss that does what it has to do - not a classic but it's a nice bit of sentimental tosh.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Good film, but predictable. Driver shines.","A pretty good film. Several things at the end were utterly predictable. Robin Williams is so much better when he goes low-key, like here. I was very impressed with Minnie Driver's performance, something I haven't seen much mention of. (Although I haven't read all five gazillion comments) She really nailed it here. Damon and Affleck were OK. The script was good, but I don't think it was any better than ""As Good as it Gets"" also nominated that year. (I haven't seen the other two nominees) One thing I liked was that the actors at least attempted the Boston accent. I suppose to a Yankee, it would seem uneven, but at least they tried.

"Inspirational and enjoyable style, but too much of the film is recycled. **1/2 (out of four)","GOOD WILL HUNTING / (1997) **1/2 (out of four)The tremendous, puzzling critical and public praise ""Good Will Hunting"" received utterly astounds me. What has America come to in order to get such great satisfaction out of a movie like this, jumping back and forth between presumptive concepts and a shameless plot; Gus Van Sant directs a script by Matt Damon and Ben Afflect, who think they are much better than they are. The two screenwriters actually took home the Oscar in 1997 for their work. But why? The movie certainly has an inspiring style, and if you do not try to hard you might find yourself having a good time watching it. But with more thought this script could have actually been worthy of the Awards it caught.The movie takes place at a Boston University where we meet an egotistical and youthful janitor named Will Hunting (Matt Damon). Nobody would ever guess beneath his tough and cocky attitude, urges to get nowhere in life, series of problems with the law, and rebellious actions that he is the smartest individual in Boston, if not the planet Earth. It feels so customary, the most unexpected person in the university is the smartest. Most of us will not find ourselves surprised when we learn this character has a deeply troubled past.Will Hunting beats the crap out of a police officer and finds himself with a demanding prison sentence. This is where the movie puts a new spin on an old cliché: instead of a father pushing a rebellious offspring to live the life he wants him to live, here we have a college professor and a young janitor going at the notion. The professor (Stellan Skarsgard) realizes this young man has an extremely complex ability to solve mathematical problems and offers Will an alternative to jail time. He gets the reluctant juvenile a kind psychiatrist named Sean (Robin Williams). The filmmakers use this character to inject a bunch of other irritating dramatic contrivances in the story, dealing with previous child abuse, professional competitiveness, alcoholism, social class conflicts, jealousy, remorse, and guilt, but Damon and Affleck use these as predictable and formulaic tools to grab our emotions. They come off as amateurish and intractable.Will is emerged in self-discovery when his relationship with Sean stabilizes. He also meets a nice, charming young girl (Minnie Driver), who provides the plot with some romantic tensions. Her character's presence is needed so we can actually witness the impact of his counseling. But Will's moral awakenings are hammered in our heads. It's like the filmmakers did not think we could figure things out on our own so they felt the need to spell things out. This is absurd; most audiences can perfectly see the intentions and emotional turmoil Will is going through. This movie insults our intelligence.The plot and theme of this movie hinge too much upon the idea that it is difficult for an intelligent person to move from low-class to a honorable member of society. This is why the contrivances are so obvious. Even after some of the thoughtless writing, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck make the amazingly egotistical choice of starring in the film themselves. Both are talented actors, and Affleck does no harm here; his character does not make much of an impact. It is Matt Damon who is one of the biggest examples of miscasting in recent movie history.  Damon does not look like a tenement citizen regardless of how hard he tries. His performance is riddled with indolent character traits, like smoking and the frequent use of profanity.Damon's character is also spectacularly aggravating. He originates no sympathy because Will is such a selfish idiot. Why should we root for him to succeed if he does not want success himself? Granted the character has a traumatic past and troubled emotions, but none of those things are executed in a convincing method, therefore it is up to Damon to fill the character with inspiration and livability, but I hated, hated, hated Will. I wanted Robin Williams to put a fist in his mouth. Is this what the filmmakers wanted, for us to despise the main character?Damon makes the performances by Stellan Skarsgard and Robin Williams standout. Robin Williams inhabits the only sensible character here; I felt so good when he kicked Will out of his office. No wonder he won best supporting actor at the Academy Awards, he is terrific. The performance captures his character's emotional and comical perspectives. Sean is also supplied with an absorbing circle of being, depth and dimension. Damon's character also perspires of such material, but Will seems to be altered for the script's needs. One scene he is ambitious and defends his friends, other times he is arrogant and cocky, yet sometimes gentle and charismatic. Minnie Driver is also charming, but her character also feels somewhat controlled. She is a plot puppet, but at least she portrays the character with personality and zest.Most of the movie has an enlightening and pleasant style, and if you are not too critical this movie does achieve its own goals. With so many problems with its plot, characters, and borrowed material, it's startling that ""Good Will Hunting"" feels uncluttered, organized, and so entertaining and human at times. But even the good substances contribute to a plate that may be a just bit too full for prosperity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Did I miss something?,"I don't get it.  I rented the movie because it was supposed to be great. It was at best mediocre.

Nothing was believable in this movie: the love, the pain, the character, or the premise.  Ben Affleck's character was the only redeeming quality in the movie.

Relatable for any young adult watching,"Good Will Hunting is one of those movies that seem so relatable yet so tragic at the same time.

Great but not a homerun,"Good Will Hunting is about Will Hunting (played by Matt Damon), a kid from the south of Boston. He is a genius born into a life of poverty and is on the wrong path in life. He meets a psychologist (played by Robin Williams) who helps guide him towards a better life.I really enjoyed Good Will Hunting. It has some great moments, some funny ones and some pretty emotional ones. Will is a very complex character and it's interesting to follow his journey and attempt to understand him. I really enjoyed his relationship with Sean (the psychologist). I thought the scenes with Will and his friends added some great humour and made for some good breaks to lighten up the mood. Will's relationship with Skylar was also great to watch but I would've liked to more of it. I wish that the movie would've been extended a couple of more minutes with a scene or two between them at the end. My only complaint about this movie is its ending. I am having hard time putting it into words but I would've liked to see more. I don't say this often but I woudn't mind if the movie was longer because I felt that the ending was kind of abrupt and a bit unsatisfying. It didn't feel quite right, like there was more of the story and more of Will to be explored and like there just was more to be said. I guess I would've liked more certainty about what happens to Will in the future as well.To summarize, as said in the title this movie is great, but not a homerun. In my opinion it falls on the finish line, but then again it's an opinion and you might like it. Other than that the movie was really good and enjoyable to watch. I would absolutely recommend it if you are into dramas with a bit of romance and that are kind of emotional but even if you aren't I still believe it's worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I Feel Dirty And It Won't Wash Off,"I first saw this movie when it came out in the cinema and enjoyed it. Then I saw it again today on TV and was dismayed at much I had apparently been sucked in by the Hollywood hype:  two kids write the screenplay, star in it as well, it's an utterly brilliant film and gets an Oscar -- and I fell for it hook, line and sinker.  OK, I will let this be a lesson to myself.  The way I see it today is that it is a well - executed film, but the story is pure drizzle.  Not just non - academic yob turns out to be talented, that would have been a realistic premise and could have made for a likeable movie.  But not good enough for Hollywood -- instead it has to be a janitor at the MIT, and of course he is a gazillion times more brilliant than the professor (who is of course a field - medal - aspiring genius in his own right) of the very building he is working in.  Hold on, I'm not finished. And this dude is also a genius in other areas, at least enough so to impress the judge with his legal cognizance, and he can quote lengthy passages out of philosophy books and he's into organic chemistry just for kicks, and he is a total fire - fighter - cute hunk as well, and he's good at fisticuffs too, and he wins the heart and hand of this super - intelligent, cute and rich chick who turns out to have a heart of gold and is the only one to accept him for what he really is, but he has got this problem facing his own genius because he would rather continue his squalid life of petty crime and dead - end jobs (hey, don't we all?), but then this brilliant psychiatrist who looks ten times more like Sigmund Freud than the man himself comes to the rescue, and -- totally unexpected -- things tie up to a happy end.

An Incredibly Grounded and Captivating Story,"Good Will Hunting is quite an iconic film and the title was flung around in conversation, when discussing good films. Many people around me had raved about this film, but not mentioning the specific aspects of the film that was especially effective. So I was always curious and intrigued by this film, but honestly expecting to be a little underwhelmed, due to the ""hype"" created. However this film lived up to the high expectations I loved; the pacing of the storyline, the dynamic range of framing and compositions, and especially the character work.Firstly, in terms of the acting in this film, the performances are especially effective, creating that authenticity and further drawing me into the storyline. Matt Damon portrayed his character; Will, very well, he explored all of the pain and the joy that character felt to such a high degree, to a point where it became the highlight of the scene. Often in a lot of scenes he had a dance partner, which was the character of Sean, played by the brilliant Robin Williams. Robin Williams masterfully created depth within his character, so that when his character had moments of comedy or pain there was meaning, integrity, and intention...The character establishing is one of the great aspects of the story that helps in building the world the audience becomes temporarily immersed within. The audience throughout the film slowly gets to know the characters of Sean, played by Robin Williams, who have experienced great pain, but is so emotionally intelligent and truly cares for Will.

And another example, Chuckie, Will's best friend, knows he cannot escape his grueling reality, but wants the best for Will.

"My second comment, but","I had originally reviewed this movie a year after I saw it, and in my review, I gave it restrained praise.  'Does it have it's flaws. Yes. It does go on a bit too long, and Minnie Driver's character borders on caricature'. After rewatching, I have to take those two comments back.  It didn't seem too long during the second viewing, and Minnie Driver's character had real depth, something I had missed on my original viewing.However, one thing that I have to comment on is the script.  It felt much better the second time around.  Damon and Affleck have a natural ability to create dialogue that flows, almost like lyrics to a song.  None of it seems forced, and it becomes quite moving in several scenes.  The scenes between Williams and Damon are so well written, and are acted very precisely, they become quite powerful.The music also works quite well, something else that I overlooked in my first viewing.  I'm glad I watched it again, and it's status had certainly risen in my mind.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Didn't like it, overrated","In this sea of praises, I will put out my opinion. And I don't care how I will be judged for it. Even if it is the case that I didn't understand all the layers of the movie, I will speak my mind.The main character Will is at the same time so unrealistic and so unrelatable it drags the whole movie down. If it was realistic we would have way more janitors working at NASA. Ok so this Will guy, how is he so smart? Math is a series of logical conclusions that builds concepts on top of concepts and if he is gifted, then he can probably figure a lot of stuff on his own. But to the extent he is portrayed in this movie? Completely unrealistic. And we don't get much of his background either. We just get his empty home his friends pick him up from. Why would I give a damn about Will?This movie feels like a silly unbelievable anime. Like those where a skinny dude beats up the jock and gets a harem of girls. He is a genius, is emotionally unstable, lives alone, works as a janitor at MIT and everything just falls into place in such a way that everything in the movie happens? Give me a break. Will is so unlikable until the very end when he becomes just tolerable. And I still have no reason to care about him because I don't know enough about his background.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It's a small film, with no particular peculiarites (except the fact that Will is a maths genius, a fact that doesn't dominate the film as much as I believed before I saw it).

Pretentious and Manipulative,"A math genius works as a janitor at MIT, unable to overcome his difficult upbringing. The premise of this film is ludicrous. It really requires suspension of belief to buy that Damon, who never attended college, has become a genius by reading books. The pretentious and manipulative script by Damon and Afleck really reaches: not only can he do complex math problems, but he can hold his own with anyone when discussing politics, philosophy, economics, literature, and history. We are supposed to root for Damon, but he's such an arrogant jerk that one roots for someone to punch him out. Williams is fine as a psychologist, but it's a role he has played a number of times.

The Barroom Debate Scene,"Thank God for Jay Mohr and the short lived series Action. At least they had the courage to directly, on-the-air, from other Hollywood players, lambaste this monstrosity of ascript that went all the way to the Oscar's!Bad scripts come and go. Just part of life. Giving them Oscars as Best Screenplay is criminal.  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are fine human beings and good looking guys living great lives.  They just can't write to save them, that's all.The barroom debate scene between the snooty student and the self educated Damon is merely the most pretentious and stupid scene EVER to portray itself as having any connection to reality whatsoever. Why didn't it get THAT Oscar?This awful film was a top ten grossing movie in 1997. That's the really scary part.  This bad a film does that well. And it's not an action flick, it pretends to be an intellectual flick with an important message!  As you read this, if you didn't see the gruesome falseness of the barroom debate scene, just remember that your really dwelling some place far out, but nowhere in the real world.  I bet you liked Blair Witch.A very distant second in the removed-from-reality category could be Jason Robarbs in the ""senior partners take a shower together scene"" in Philadelphia.  But that's not really close to this masterwork.  One can also think of the Happy Days episode where Fonzie and Richie go to a snooty rich people's party and are treated so badly.  Another worthy contender. Several episodes of The White Shadow perhaps? James At Sixteen? I'll wager young Matt and Damon loved those shows!The bar is set. That barroom debate scene may not be the worst thing ever filmed.  But it is certainly the most intellectually pretentious and cloyingly stupid scene ever made.  No surprise to finding Robin Williams in this film. How did he let them leave him out of this scene? Oversight.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Better than Good,"According to legendary film-writer William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Princess Bride), it was he who changed Affleck and Damon's treatment from something altogether more conventional into the Oscar-winning screenplay filmed by Gus Van Sant. Whoever is responsible, we should simply be glad the film was made, as it's a very well realised, emotionally satisfying, mostly original drama; from the moving performances, especially from Robin Williams and Minnie Driver, to Van Sant's camera, forever searching for the soul of the scene, this is clearly confident, intelligent film-making.For all its truths, the film is fantastical: under Danny Elfman's twinkling, otherworldly score, there isn't a single shot of Will (Damon) actually reading one of the books he knows by heart. Indeed, we're never quite clear where Will finds the time to feed his dizzying intellect between working, fighting and drinking. Less forgivable is that Driver's Skylar is rather unfairly banished from the third act, reducing a bright character to a dull device to provide a neat ending.For my money, in terms of Van Sant's 'crowd-pleasing' output, Good Will Hunting doesn't quite scale the heights of the more acerbic To Die For, or the more politically substantial Milk.

Gus Van Sant also did a good job adding feeling and color where dialogue was absent. Hell, even the score chosen was appropriate for the scenes they portrayed. Williams did a tremendous outshine everyone job acting, and even Afleck and Damen were far from shabby.  And as much as we all like to hate Driver, she too was ok I guess.

I like someone who can out-brain the brains; but I agree that Matt Damon does not have the persona to pull it off. Ben Affleck would have been a better choice. I think Damon was chosen as the main star because he is less handsome and charismatic than Affleck. They wanted to get Damon in the door of public awareness first.Oh well.

This movie is in the genre that are the most important for one to watch, because they are movies about people. Relationships, insecurities, childhood trauma, but most of all - development.Good Will Hunting shows the development of a character in no other way I've seen in movies before, with Will starting out as a typical troublemaker always looking to push your buttons and sniff out what makes you tick, and the reason for this becomes apparent as you watch the movie. But by the end, he's a transformed man, a mirrored version of the Will we are introduced to at the start of the movie.This film is also unique in the way it teaches its lessons - through Will's therapy sessions throughout the movie.

The screenwriting's on the wall...,"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck give very good performances in this film but the thing that baffles me and I can never seem to understand is why they won an Oscar for this screenplay. Not that the screenplay wasn't good, it was. But why did THEY win? As far as I gather all Damon and Affleck wrote was the first draft of the screenplay. But their version was some sort of horrible action film about a math genius on the lam from a crooked government trying to exploit his talents, involving high-speed car chases and buildings exploding etc. It wasn't until William Goldman, an experienced screenwriter was hired, that the film became this ""inner-growth and maturity"" story that eventually got released. Goldman wrote the bulk of the screenplay alone and didn't even get credit as a script-consultant. As far as the credits of the film are concerned, he wasn't even there. Of course Damon and Affleck came up with the main-character and some of the stuff in the script themselves, but they did not write the script that was actually filmed. And it really makes sense. How could two such inexperienced writers produce a first screenplay of such quality and go from rags to riches literally overnight? Sounds exciting doesn't it? Just the kind of story Hollywood likes to tell. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck give even better performances in real life than in the film itself.

Williams very much deserved his Oscar and I can't think of anybody who could have played his role any better than him. Damon has always struck me as a smart and cocky type of person but for a few fleeting moments, shows real vulnerability.

Hell and the Lonely genius,"When searching for intellectual success and humanistic relationships between life and career, there is a simple formula which works for a few people. It is an equation which reads, Superior intellectual equals power, but results in pain and isolation. Such is the story of Will Hunting, superbly played by Matt Damon. Born with a I. Q. Genius, the young man seeks friends and mathematical challenges alike. Consequently when he finds either, he attacks one and embraces the other. As a result, he lives in a world of turmoil and volatile possibilities. Unable to tolerate authoritative or academic hypocrisy, he armors himself with the sword and shield of intellectual arrogance and gives battle to anyone and everything around him. What troubles him the most is the dark pain of abuse in his youth and it is here he is most vulnerable. Robin Williams who portrays Dr. Sean Maguire give one of his most stirring performances as a sensitive and compassionate psychiatrist.

Van Sant is the real star,"I had a real problem with the sentimentality of this movie. It drips with string-tugging melodrama and amateurish characterizations. The only movies that can get away with such tortured pop psychology were all made by Alfred Hitchcock.I liked Minnie Driver and Ben Affleck, accent or no (it's hard to tell), and Robin Williams was OK. Matt Damon's character is so depressingly obvious that it's difficult to sit through his journey to self-awareness, and the epiphany scene is just embarrassing.But I can't say enough about Gus Van Sant and his deceptively transparent direction. Somehow he makes the flat script come alive with just a few touches. Notice how he uses the stationary and panning shots - and how he frames each image to make it vital. This is especially true for the scenes with Driver.

There are so many defining scenes in the movie.The whole film basically revolves along realized potential and finding your way in life. There is one scene in a bar between the math professor and the psychologist that seemed to define the whole movie for me.Overall one of my favorite films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Matt Damon sticks to the formula in this cliche ridden drama.,"Haven't we seen this one before? Matt Damon must have looked at everything that's won awards in the history of the Academy and included every cliche he could scavenge into his screenplay.1. The angst-ridden genius who resents his gift, because everybody he knows is trying to force him into a better life. A life he doesn't want because he's happy just being an average loser like all his friends.2. The teacher who discovers him, who we are meant to believe genuinely wants to help him, but by the end we find out just wants to live his own lost dreams vicariously through his prodigy.3. The psychiatrist who has troubles of his own, so by the end of the film they unwittingly help each other out.4. Of course a romantic interest has to be thrown in to create the standard conflict. Should he choose a life with his friends, his girl, or a high paying job. Naturally he chooses to abandon everything and run off to a girl he barely knows. I hope I'm not the only one who saw that coming a mile away. Men are always portrayed as saps in these types of films.Robin Williams gives us another one of his trademark two characters. He's always either manic and over-the-top, or quiet and introverted. In this case we get the latter, essentially the same guy we saw in Awakenings. I prefer him in the manic roles, at least then I don't have to suspend my disbelief enough to accept Mork giving psychological advice.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
only here for robin williams lol,"Good Will Hunting is a pretty good coming-of-age movie. It's about the man, Will, who has a genius-level IQ and he worked at MIT as a janitor. The math professor discovered his talent and wanted to help him to achieve his success. When Will was arrested, the professor made a deal that Will would work with him as he get therapy. Overall, the movie has good psychological thinking and it talks about certain heavy topics. There are some plot holes and the fighting scenes, in the beginning, aren't executed well. However, I love Robin Williams' acting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The realism and authenticity is unbelievable,"Today I am ending my birthday on a high by reviewing my all time favourite movie. Good Will Hunting Directed by Gus Van Sant, contains such an incredible screenplay written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. The plot is simply based on a genius who isn't living to his potential due to the traumatic impact of his past. For a topic which has been attempted countless times in film history, Good Will Hunting still holds the benchmark. Each and every word of the script is perfection. Moments of outrage as well as moments of therapy contain some of the most well written lines in cinema. Robin Williams' performance was truly inspiring. His line delivery has a way of transcending the screen and connecting with the audience on a deep, emotional level. I say this is my favourite film due to the fact that it is talented film making in its barest form. All that is required is a great script and talented performances, in order to create such a timeless film. This movie holds up incredibly well. Age hasn't made it less powerful or emotionally outdated. This is one of the very few films which actually impacted my personal life and changed my mindset. The bleak visuals together with Elliot Smith's melancholy music, establishes such a beautiful, sorrowful tone throughout the entire runtime. Not once do I ever believe I am watching a film whilst sitting through Good Will Hunting. The realism and authenticity is unbelievable. If you haven't seen Good Will Hunting, you're currently deprived from one of the greatest films in history. This film repeatedly leaves me in awe each and every time I experience it. Good Will Hunting is undoubtably a 10. I recommended reading through screenplay after watching the film. It's an absolute masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Cliched, unreal, predictable and manipulative","I'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one. When I was watching this movie, a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever you're ""supposed"" to sob -- or at least feel ""touched"". Like when Hunting said he didn't love the girl. Like when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot his role's name) was telling Hunting repeatedly ""It's not your fault"" (oh Lord, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). I couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters. Many people sob for Hollywood manufactured characters they can't even relate to (think Titanic; Yuck!)... but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre. I guess I simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all this.Folks it's not me who's being condescending ... those characters are, and for no good reason because they're unreal. Worse yet, nothing is new or surprising. Even Robin Williams' character is all cliched.I gave it 1 out of 10. It's probably not that bad; it's just quite mediocre... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10 so I figured a single balancing vote won't hurt.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Great! will hunting,"Not many movies make me emotional enough to shed a tear. This one did on multiple occasions. On an airplane. Which is not the proper conditions for an emotional outburst. But it happened. God knows what would've happened if I watched this in the privacy of my own home! Stellar film with a chuck ton of heart. Felt authentic, was original.I liked how it portrayed relationships
Relationships between friends, and the safe loyalty that comes with that. I enjoyed the reality shown in Wills relationship with skyla. The natural fears many of us face with love. It spoke to the heart, because it got to the heart and it told the truth. Love is scary! Life is scary and imperfect. I think this film portrayed this imperfect reality well. I think sometimes in an effort to show the imperfections of life a movie can get pretty sloppy, like the fabelmans for example. That shows a messy life. And it left me feeling gross. But this film felt real, and full of hope and light. It's a film about overcoming! Really great film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Matt Damon nails it as Will Hunting, showing his intelligence, pain, and even humor with pure authenticity. And Robin Williams as the therapist, Sean Maguire, is like the perfect balance to Will.

Masterpiece,"This film is undeniably a masterpiece, reminiscent of a time when movies carried profound messages. While it may be considered a slow-burner, every moment is deliberate and purposeful, leading to a deeply intense psychological journey culminating in a beautifully crafted catharsis.The portrayal of a man (Will) grappling with profound emotional wounds, shying away from intimacy and cloaking himself in defense mechanisms, resonates profoundly with viewers. This raw depiction may challenge some, as it reflects aspects of their own lives back to them. However, it's precisely this introspective quality that makes the film so impactful. The iconic scene where Sean repeatedly reassures Will affirming that it's not his fault, delivers the catharsis viewers crave.The stellar acting and brilliant script are made even more impressive by the fact that they were penned by two 25-year-old writers. Their ability to delve into such profound psychological depths surpasses that of many individuals twice their age, making this film a remarkable achievement in storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A math genius that never reads a book,"The movie tells a very touching story about a math genius. However, I was surprised that although he solves very difficult math problems that the renowned professor couldn't do, and he quotes long excerpts from historical books in front of other boys and girls to show his deep knowledge and talent, however, we never see him reads in a book, or holds a book or has a book at his home. This is not convincing. Being a genius does not mean he solves complicated problems by heart. It's not a revelation. Maths means a lot of research, thinking and reading and experimenting, and you get baffled how he became such a gifted person when he did not show any of these functions or reflect any love for or close relation to books.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Good film with Robin,"The guys deserve great credit for tackling a serious issue with their first screenplay and not merely filling the script with a lot of scatological humour (Though there is some of that here too, it just doesn't seem out of place) All of the characters are well rounded and sympathetic in some way, and you never feel they are there simply out of formula or to further the plot. The development of the story grows organically through the characters. Even Skylar, the love interest (played beautifully by Minnie Driver, as too are the rest of the performances great) is an interesting character in her own right and someone we want to follow through the story. The only measurable difference between her role and that of Matt Damon's is that he has more screen time, but this is understandable, given that he is the title character.In reply to those who say that the repeated profanity use highlights a lack of writing skills, I disagree.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"""It's Not Your Fault"" - A Heartfelt Journey in Good Will Hunting","Good Will Hunting is a profoundly moving film that left a lasting impression on me. The story of Will, a janitor with a genius-level intellect, is both heart-wrenching and inspiring.

I absolutely adore this movie. I think the concept is brilliant, I think the actors chosen are perfect, I think the busy, city life setting is the right move. There's just so much that works here for me. I think the final 10 minutes of the movie is arguably the most powerful because it leaves the the viewer saying to themselves ""wow, this is it, this is the end of a young mans routine in which he's done everyday for his entire life, what's next""? That final question you ask yourself is so powerful because the director allows the viewer to becomes so ""obsessed"" and comfortable with Will's everyday routine, and now he's moving on to bigger and better things. Understanding this is so satisfactory because this is after all of his blood, sweat and tears. It's nice to see a genuine movie with true intentions end in such a pure way.

We watch Will evolution from a simple janitor to someone worth being proud of, with the help of his teacher and especially a psychologist who dedicates himself to Will's case.It's a movie which understands how to create such a dramatic plot, insisting on Will's very difficult condition which made him end up in his current social position, keeping it up until the very end.

It manages to be full of emotion, drama and even suspense as the characters ""fight"" to overcome their respective condition.The movie manages to maintain a good line of unpredictability.

Well crafted film that essentially glorifies white-trash.,"Well acted and written film.  However, it follows in a long tradition in Western culture of romanticizing white-trash.  The recipe is usually the same.  Take a working class loser, make him very handsome, brave, charming, and extremely intelligent, then contrast him against well educated people who are shown to be sexually frustrated, neurotic, and otherwise unhappy, and you create a white-trash hero.  ""Good Will Hunting"" plays this game very effectively.  By the end of the film it has you believing the classic lie that education is unnecessary and all that matters in life is that you get the girl.  Still, a good film at what it tries to do.

It's almost 2020 and this film was so ahead of its time,"I have never written a review before. I have rated a great many films and TV series but there was one scene in this film that so profoundly affected me, that I had to comment about it. Now I have watched this film several times since it was made and really enjoyed it, but today 12/30/19, I had to comment on this one particular scene in the movie. The scene is when Will is meeting with the NSA guy, regarding why he should join the clandestine agency. First may I say, how ahead of its time Will's explanation is, as to why he should not join the NSA. It is prior 911 and prior to any current scrutiny of these agencies. Will's response to why he shouldn't join the organization is unbelievably prophetic, considering it was written 22 years ago. His explanation of why he shouldn't, should make every proud citizen struggling to survive, question the current standards and practices of our government agencies including and especially our president's. Will's response explains the actions of the agency and its consequences to the average american citizen. So if you are a reasonable adult, who values morality and is now questioning or possibly doubting our current government agencies, politicians and our presidenct due to questionable tactics and policies, please watch this scene in the movie. Just do so with an open heart and mind.

What do geniuses say?,"Good story, excellent acting - especially by Matt Damon, really outdistancing all the others - and an awakener of many thoughts. Just one thing: what do geniuses say, really?A script writer might need to be one, too, to get it right. This film leans heavily on learning, instead of wisdom, on wits instead of brilliance, on truisms instead of innovative perspectives. The actors do a great job in hiding this flaw, but there it is.The nature of the genius has been explored since the romanticism of the early 19th century - I'm not sure the idea of such blessed humans was even around, before that. Maybe such people exist, and maybe not. In most cases, they have very specialized talents. Some have perfect memory, others excel at math. That does in no way make them better equipped for rhetoric or social skills. Thus, a genius can be a real idiot, outside that special field of competence.Let's say that two brilliant persons sit down and have a very enlightened conversation with each other. What do they say? How much do they have to say? And will we, the audience, at all understand? Afore such uncertainties, succumbing to a love story finale seems to be the safe way out.

"Way, Way, WAY Overrated, Maudlin, Schlocky Fairy Tale","It's a somewhat watchable film only for Matt Damon's above average understated performance and Robin Williams' usual quality work, but the emotionally manipulative story is just too overwrought and self indulgent to warrant my admiration.A mathematical super-genius who chooses to clean toilets is such a nearly impossible, outlandish premise, but we're expected to swallow it hook line and sinker. Am I supposed to relate to the poor misunderstood prodigy with the humble, blue collar heritage? This is just a typical Hollywood Cinderella fantasy relocated to Academia with some heartrending pablum tossed in for the ladies. Delusional, nonsensical melodrama that deigns to present itself as insightful and profound, but it really isn't. It's mostly contrived and tedious.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I always find myself forgetting this movie exists and i go back to watch it and even though i know whats gonna happen i find myself crying in the exact same scenes. Its so real and relatable. As sad it is you crack a smile a couple times and shed a tear just as much. The acting is amazing, its like your actually watching this happen in real time to real people. You feel the emotions through the screen and its liberating. Its one of those movies u can binge watch many times and never get bored of. Love this movie definitely recommend.

Top notch movie,"This is by far the best movie I've everRobin Williams was born for roles like this. Just like in Dead Poets Society and Awakenings, he delivers a performance that feels deeply personal, almost as if the role was written just for him. He brings such warmth, wisdom, and quiet power that every scene he's in becomes unforgettable. The way he plays Sean Maguire-with patience, understanding, and a touch of sorrow-makes him the heart of the movie. His monologue about his wife, the ""it's not your fault"" scene, and even the way he just sits in silence with Will all feel incredibly real. Williams doesn't just act-he feels like the mentor every lost soul wishes they had.But this movie wouldn't be what it is without Matt Damon. His portrayal of Will Hunting is so raw and convincing that it's hard to believe this was his breakthrough role. The way he captures Will's intellect, arrogance, humor, and deep emotional wounds makes him an incredibly layered character. From the first scene, where he's solving complex math problems with ease, to the moments of rage and self-sabotage, Damon makes Will feel like a real person. One of his strongest moments is the confrontation with Robin Williams' character, where he mocks Sean's painting and tries to push him away, only to be completely disarmed when Sean flips the script on him. The way Damon's expressions shift from confidence to discomfort to vulnerability in that scene is brilliant.The film does an incredible job of showing what it's like for someone who comes from nothing yet possesses extraordinary talent. Will is a genius, but he's also a product of an abusive past, foster homes, and a world that never gave him a reason to believe in himself beyond his intellect. The script (written by Damon and Ben Affleck) brilliantly captures how intelligence alone isn't enough-growth, healing, and self-worth come from human connection. That's where Sean, and to some extent Chuckie (Affleck's character), come in.Chuckie, Will's best friend, might seem like just another Boston tough guy, but he's actually one of the most important figures in Will's life. The moment where he tells Will that the best part of his day is the few seconds where he hopes Will won't be there-that he hopes Will will have left for something better-is one of the film's most powerful scenes. It's a rare depiction of tough love that isn't cruel but deeply caring.The romance between Will and Skylar (Minnie Driver) also adds another layer to the story. Their relationship is sweet, playful, and real, but it also highlights Will's biggest flaw-his inability to trust or let people in. His decision to push her away rather than risk getting hurt is one of the most heartbreaking parts of the film. It takes Sean's relentless patience and understanding to break through to him, showing him that while pain is inevitable, running from it only makes it worse.In the end, Good Will Hunting isn't just about a gifted young man discovering his potential-it's about breaking cycles, facing fears, and realizing that intelligence means nothing if you don't allow yourself to truly live. The performances, the writing, and the deeply human themes make this one of the best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
From Bottom to Top,"I see a movie with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and I tend to drift away from it but this film was different. Matt and Ben tend to be dry, boring actors and never tend to be in very interesting films. They fit into the characters so well you would think they were actually real people. Although I never really enjoy movies with either of these actors I thought this film was very well done. I give it a 10/10! A film of brilliance, heartbreak, rebellion, and a wild adventure. Knowing that they directed this movie I thought the plot would be awful but it really captured the essence of human nature. Matt and Ben really got into character and captured the true personality of two boys from 1980""s South Boston. From roaming the streets, bar fights, to the accents and the culture.Will is a young boy at the bottom of the social pyramid who has lived a lonely, abusive life. He works as a janitor at MIT but is yet extremely intelligent and begins solving their problems that not even the professors could do. Because of his lifestyle and who he is it's not okay for him to express his intelligents to society.This film tells a story that is quite common yet is hidden from the world. Will (Matt) is highly intelligent yet he never puts it to use. People continue to push him to move forward and use his abilities yet he chooses not to. He's at the bottom of the social pyramid but has the ability to be at the top. People read into him and he feels threatened by that so he tries to outsmart them by reading deeper into them tearing them apart. Just like any movie there is always a girl but it isn't all lovey dovey. This movie captures the struggle of love in which he struggles with from his early childhood. Will picks up a girl at the bar and they talk and grow closer until she falls in love with him. She tries to push him to do something with his abilities and be a part of his life but that scares him so he tells her he doesn't love her even though he truly does. He fears being loved and hurting her.This movie really deals about vulnerability, fear, friendship, and of course love. Will feels vulnerable being loved by a woman. A relationship would make him have to open up in which he fears because he feels as if he doesn't deserve love. He fears the judgement. Robin shows how powerful love really is by talking about his wife whom even though is dead he constantly cherishes their moments together and shares them, his life still revolves around her, he expresses happiness then and now. Will is scared to share his potential with the world because he doesn't know what that might bring upon him and others. He's scared to see how society will view him. He enjoys his abilities but is fearful to put them into the world. Will's therapist whom is Robin Williams tries to read into Will in which Will begins to try and stab at him and this continues for multiple sessions and some sessions are just silent with no talking. Robin waits for Will to make the first move of speaking because he's not going to solve his problems for him. The most simple stories lead to the most valuable advice in which Will slowly starts to accept and they form a friendship. Eventually Will goes and gets the girl, he opens up and brings himself out there, he wants happiness and love. He started at the bottom and slowly climbs his way to the top.Overall, this movie is very well done. It's like a psych lesson. This movie is relate able to real life because there are many people out there just like Will and yet we turn a blind eye to them and they never get to express their true potential. The movies ends unknowingly just like real life, we never know where we will end up we can only imagine what will happen to us next and proceed to take those steps. It captures the human nature that we are too afraid to bring ourselves too. Highly interesting, charismatic, brilliant, rebelling film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
inspiring,"This film is a 10/10, it revealed to me that being vulnerable and communicating with others is needed to over come our traumas. Will expresses intelligence instead of vulnerability throughout the film so he doesn't have to confront his emotions. Sean was one person who helped Will shed the layers of built up traumas that were holding him back from his true potential. The end of the Film was satisfying knowing that Will makes a move out of true love.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Perhaps not given to genius directing, but because of emotions capturing the audience's attention and, most importantly, their hearts.They are able to do all of this while still maintaining their lines funny, light and witty.

Living Genius Society,"A case where Hollywood lucks out and 2 young writers/actors come along and create a masterful script that tricks Robin Williams to do a sequel to Dead Poets Society. Not literally, but the story's formula and function of Robin's DPS character remain the same. Calculus replaces poetry with a hint of matrices to come.Outside of setting and soundtrack mistakes of Gus Van Sant's mid-life crisis and 1970s revelry that makes this film seem a decade older than his classic My Own Private Idaho (1991), the first half is genius. Then, he and Robin Williams turn it into more of a seize the girl, love-will-save-you cliché than an outside-the-matrix, seize your genius modern-day intellectual fantasy.Despite the probably unintentional attempts to subvert it and the annoying product placement that had taken over Hollywood, the story is an adult male intellectual/geek fantasy.

"Well Deserved Oscars for Williams, Damon and Affleck","One of the benefits of ""Secret Movie Night"" is that it forces me to watch (or rewatch) a film that I would not seek out on my own. Such is the case with this month's selection - GOOD WILL HUNTING - the film that made Matt Damon and Ben Affleck stars and earned the late, great Robin Williams his only Academy Award.Leaning hard on the mantra ""write what you know"", GOOD WILL HUNTING tells the tale of a generationally talented math prodigy, who grew up in South Boston and fights his demons to find his place in this world.Famously, the screenplay of this film earned Damon and Affleck Oscars for Best Original Screenplay and it is well deserved. They paint a picture of life of these ""Southies"" that appears to me real and genuine. The ""family"" feel of the friendship of the main characters rings true and Damon and Affleck have real chemistry with each other - like old friends playing off each other.However, the relationship between Affleck and Damon's character in this film is only the 3rd best relationship in this film. The best, of course, is the relationship between Will Hunting (Damon) and the shrink that is assigned to him, played by Robin Williams. It is a haunting, raw, emotional and REAL performance by Williams - one very deserving of the Oscar - and I was more than a little sad to watch this performance knowing that this uniquely talented performer is no longer with us.The surprise to me in this rewatch of the film is the performance of Minnie Driver as a young lady that becomes emotionally attached to Will. Driver's performance as Harvard student Skylar is also real and the struggles of her character to get a connection with Will was heartbreaking to watch.Good Will Hunting also features strong supporting work by Stellan Skarsgard as the MIT Math Professor who discovers - and then becomes jealous of - Will's talents and Ben Affleck's younger brother, a then unknown Casey Affleck, who steals almost every scene he is in.All of this would not have worked without the magnificent, Oscar nominated, Direction of Gus Van Sant (DRUGSTORE COWBOY). He was the perfect choice to direct this intimate, personal drama and he has a way of drawing out the emotions and rawness of the characters on the screen without being cloying or overdramatic. He was a strong contender for Best Director that year (as was Good Will Hunting for Best Picture) but it ran into a roadblock that was James Cameron and TITANIC.If you have never seen this film - or if you haven't seen this in quite some time - check out GOOD WILL HUNTING, it is well worth your time.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Masterpiece in Character Study. A Symbol of the Things We Forgot as a Society,"As of 2023, the year in which this review is being written, we have forgotten that these types of movie were the ones at the height of mainstream cinema.Nowadays, we are accustomed to big budget movies that focus too much on how they show images on a screen rather than what they are trying to tell us through those images. That has led us to a weird moment in the movie making industry. The centerpiece of current movies are these big actor and actresses that have become a sort of cultural pillar of the industry. Making them seem ""higher than life"" and do incredible things on the screen is the most important thing, the story that is being told plays second fiddle to that.So to watch a movie like Good Will Hunting is a huge breath of fresh air. We can relate to every single character in the movie, at some point or another, and the magic happens precisely because of it.From a genius young man with a dark past, to an academic mastermind in the math field, to a student who struggles to balance her academic and personal lives, to a promising psychologist that has given up on life due to the lost of the love of his life, it is uncanny how they are all so different, and yet so relatable. As the movie moves on, and we start to peel the layers of these characters, we get to truly know them and see how they struggle with feelings that we wall have. We see how these feelings affects their lives, as different from our as they might be.At that point, all these characters get together to tell us a wonderful story that is universal and can resonate with each and every one of us.The movie was impeccably written by the newcomers (at the time) Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who also showed incredible acting skills. The combination of Matt Damon and Rachel Majorowski (who unfortunately we never saw again in the mainstream) gave us some really touching and deep moments. Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck's brother and one of my favorite actors, was already showing the depth of his acting. And needless to say that Robin Williams, one of the all-time greats, brought heart and soul to the movie with his perfectly balanced acting complemented by the always reliable Stellan Skarsgård.The writing is simple, but effective in its character study and clever on how it makes us connect to the characters and feel their vulnerabilities not a sign of weakness, but strength and bravery. Vulnerability that was lost to us a society, in an age where everyone tries to be as invincible and powerful as the ""super characters"" we see on the current movie screen.Sometimes, we don't need to save the world or change the political landscape of society. Sometimes we need to fight the battles within and understand that the biggest winnings are done by connecting with others and accepting our vulnerabilities. Only then can we move on to a better place in our lives.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

First, let me say that I actually liked ""Good Will Hunting"": solid performances, fantastic direction, stylish cinematography, and a brilliant film score by Danny Elfman. At the same time, there was something in the film that I found somewhat imperfect: the script. I mean, the plot itself was well-put together (although it felt often overdramatized with lots of sentimentality), but the dialogues were not always realistic... as sometimes the characters spoke kinda weird - for example, a conversation between Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgård (two excellent actors) sounded strange and it felt like they were just reading their lines to each other, a dialogue with hundreds of swearwords in it... and the characters in such scenes did not seem that multi-dimensional.

Absolutely ingenious,"I'm imagining that the people who call this film boring are of the frame of mind, that unless a film has at least three explosions then it's not worth the price of a cinema ticket. Then there are the people calling it unrealistic. Now forgive me but I come from a similar background to the central character Will and I believe myself to be intelligent, but I didn't use my intelligence until very recently. Instead I took to taking drugs and drinking and swearing! Only a few years ago I was working as a cleaner, but now I'm studying programming and media technology at the best technical University in the UK. Now if I can identify with this film's realism (and I live in England) why can't so many others? This film is a veritable jewel. The script is one of the best I've ever seen. The way it mixes thought provoking ideas and witticisms with the kind of colloquial dialogue which we have read in things like 'The Catcher in the Rye'. Now I agree with the sentiment that some people have put across, 'get in touch with your inner Robin Williams'. But thankfully the script or Gus Van Sant or whatever prevented it from going over board. Look at the final scene where they're hugging and saying their farewells. Now this could have overlapped into a typical slushy moment, but no the lines 'Doesn't this contravene the Doctor, patient relationship?' 'Only if you grab my ass' were uttered so as to diffuse it. Then bear in mind that you never actually see the reunion between Skylar and Will! I could go on forever arguing against people's criticisms. But what's the point if certain viewers can't appreciate the subtly evocative direction of Van Sant, the quick fire script and the superb performances by the cast.

Great movie!,"It's been a long time since a film truly resonated with me on this level. Good Will Hunting is an extraordinary cinematic achievement, and in my opinion, Gus Van Sant's masterpiece. While the pacing might seem deliberate and slow at times, I believe this was an intentional choice that significantly contributes to the film's emotional depth and psychological exploration.The deliberate slow burn allows us to fully immerse ourselves in the lives and internal struggles of the characters. We witness Will's raw genius, his emotional turmoil, and his hesitant steps towards healing. The film masterfully captures the nuances of human connection, the importance of mentorship, and the enduring power of self-discovery.The performances are exceptional, with Robin Williams delivering an Oscar-worthy portrayal of Sean Maguire, a therapist who challenges Will to confront his demons and embrace his potential. Matt Damon, as Will Hunting, is equally captivating, embodying the character's brilliance, rebelliousness, and underlying vulnerability with raw authenticity.Good Will Hunting is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll.

"A very good film, but with some flaws and problems that deserve attention.","This film is about a boy from Boston, who comes from very poor backgrounds, but who has a gift for mathematics, easily solving theorems and advanced problems that leave Harvard professors unanswered. He is discovered after solving one, at night and without telling anyone, and one of the professors at the university decides to help him be someone and make use of his gift. The problem is that he doesn't want to, he's not able to trust anyone, and he's seriously stuck with justice. Therefore, he will recruit an irreverent psychiatrist to try to help the boy.The film's premise is very good, and the story has merits that we cannot ignore or minimize. It's one of those delicious movies to watch, that leaves us without feeling the time that passes. We really know that guy is not a bad person, but it's not easy to like the character due to his options and his bad social attitude. However, what bothered me the most was the construction of Robin Williams' character and his whole way of acting and accompanying that patient. I think anyone who has ever had the need to see a psychiatrist knows that they have strict rules about what they can and cannot do, and Williams' character breaks a good number of them.And this leads us to talk about actors. I really enjoyed Williams' work, but he is a long way from the best that the actor has given us. Matt Damon also did a good job, perhaps one of the best of his career, and one that opened more doors for him in his professional life. Stellan Skarsgard also intelligently took advantage of the opportunity to impose himself on the American cinematic scene, with a job well done and of great merit. Minnie Driver also did an interesting job, perhaps even more so than Ben Affleck, whose character doesn't have as much visibility or relevance.Technically, the film has many merits, starting with the excellent cinematography, a good set of sets and interesting costumes. The effects are understated, but they work quite well, and the soundtrack also does a pretty good job. It is not, however, a film that stands out for its technical aspects, nor could it be.

The Importance of Not Being Too Earnest,"This is just a movie, folks, not a case study.  As interested as I am in literary, historical, and sociological elements of dramatic films, I am put off by psychoanalysis or tortured deconstruction.What I liked about this one was Robin Williams' underplaying his role and Matt Damon's totally cold and rigid self-characterization -- apart from the conclusion, that is.  There is a good sense of Boston as well.The premise of the story is questionable as to any sense of consistent authenticity.  Antisocial behavior need not be a concomitant of genius, as other recent films about gifted but more or less detached characters seem to take for granted (as does this one).  Neither are saccharine catharses inevitable.  And the usually fine actor Stellan Skarsgard as the American professor with a French name and a Swedish accent seems miscast.  Ben Affleck plays Ben Affleck with a passion, not unusual in a sense but hardly commendable in terms of his overblown popular persona.  One wonders indeed how he figures in real life as putative co-author of this fairly decent screenplay.In short, there are some good moments and good lines -- and that is really what counts, even when the finished whole is less interesting or convincing than the finite parts.

"""Twenty years of counseling, I've seen some pretty awful sh*t. "" - Sean","Everyone raved about 'Good Will Hunting' when it came out. At the time all I could do was roll my eyes and say, ""Cmon. A movie written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Yuck!"". I finally got around to seeing it about a week ago, and I have to tell you I was pleasantly surprised. 'Good Will Hunting' isn't a great Oscar-worthy movie most critics pointed it out to be, but just a very good film with some good acting performances. Matt Damon in his finest acting performance yet plays Will. Will is considered a hoodlum by some and hangs out with his buddies led by Chuckie (Ben Affleck in a so-so performance, which is very good for him). They screw around, get drunk and beat people up -- they are real 'nothings' to society. But, Will has a secret -- he's a genius. He works as a janitor at Harvard University and one day solves a ""said-to-be"" impossible math problem put up by the brilliant Math professor (played by Stellan Skarsgaard in a strong performance). Will then becomes the math professor's new hero and is destined for greatness, but will Will abandon his friends to better his own life? Robin Williams steals the show in an electrifying performance as Will's psychiatrist and Minnie Driver provides good acting as Will's British Harvard girlfriend. Gus Van Sant's directing is fair and the writing is pretty solid for the most part (but nothing Academy Award worthy). The bottom line is that 'Good Will Hunting' is a very good film where the good points more then out-weigh the bad points, but it's nothing spectacular. I recommend it.

"Can you say ""hype""?","I know for sure, that if Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had not been the ones credited with having wrote this film, nobody would have seen this film. Whats more, nobody would have cared. This is Hollywood at its ""Indie"" best. Trying to pretend that some of their hot properties can be artistic as well. The only problem is that this film is so painfully average and predictable, that few film festivals would have given it the time of day, had it not been for the writers. The story is an old one, just set in a bit of a different setting. Young tough, down on his luck, born poor, no future, gets opportunity and betters himself. Ahhh, what a ""feel good"" story. Please! I just love the scene in the bar where Will shows up the cocky Harvard kid on his knowledge of American History. Damon reels off one of the most laughable historical arguments in American History. The information is accurate, but the source is ludicrous. There is no way that his character could make such an argument, even if he had read the authors and understood them. He showed knowledge of the Harvard curriculum that even someone in the Liberal Arts Department would not know. It just strained credibility as this whole movie does. It was an average at best movie that was hyped into a masterpiece. I dismiss the Academy, because I know how the Hollywood Insider game is played. I mean, come on, Kim Bassinger and Mira Sorvino have an Academy! LOL! I mean, Beverly Hills Cop won for best screenplay, even though it had been passed around for five years. In reality, this film is ** out of ****. However, did you know that Matt and Ben wrote it? **** out of ****.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
This movie stole my heart,"""Good Will Hunting"" grew on me slowly as I watched it, had an urge to want to turn it off a couple of times while watching but it all came down to one simple truth - this movie is great.
It tells a story of a young man who doesn't know his place in life and wastes most of it drinking in a bar with friends, getting into fights occasionally and doing some crappy jobs. And literally no one would blame him for it, we've all been there. But one day a time comes along and it gives you people who challenge you to get out of your shell and find your path, help you become a better person. I think everyone needs something like this movie in his life to re-evaluate it and see it in the different light.
Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's script, although a bit predictable and immature, is almost perfect despite that. The story gives you everything you want from a movie, it gives you time to roll on your back with laughter and to cry your eyes out, gives you food to think and thoughts to hold on to. Robin Williams is brilliant, he's phenomenal, he's the best thing in this movie and his closing line - amazing. Took the words right out of my mouth. Matt Damon's performance is near perfection and one of the best in his career.
It's a wonderful, kind, touching and thought-provoking movie. I loved it and would totally give it another watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
I was locked in this whole time,Tbh it lost me in the middle the pacing got a lil slow for a minute and I got lost but I got reeled back in very soon. So this movie was great it felt real like people had real relationships. Like people had lives outside of this movie and the acting was great. This is one of those movies I don't wanna talk up cause it's not for everyone and if I hype it for someone there gonna think it's bad because it doesn't live to expectations but that doesn't mean this movie isn't great. If you like quiter slower paced movies about relationships this is a great pick. It almost gave me death note vibes it's hard to talk about how good it is without spoiling and I don't want to cause this movies great so check it out.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Brilliant but Broken: A Masterpiece of Self-Discovery,"Good Will Hunting is a film that masterfully blends deep human drama, intellectual intrigue, and outstanding performances. The story of a brilliant but emotionally closed-off young man, who hides his fears behind defiance, captivates from the very first moments and holds your attention until the end.The greatest strength of the film lies in its characters. Matt Damon's portrayal of Will is raw and layered, making his pain and rebellion feel incredibly real. However, the standout performance belongs to Robin Williams as therapist Sean Maguire. His monologues, especially the powerful ""It's not your fault"" scene, are deeply moving and easily rank among the most emotionally charged moments in cinema.The film thoughtfully explores themes of past trauma, fear of the future, and the struggle for self-acceptance. There's no forced moralizing-just an honest, beautifully told story about how difficult it is to face oneself and stop running from life.If there's one aspect that could have been slightly improved, it's the development of Will and Skylar's relationship. While important to the story, it feels somewhat overshadowed by the central therapy arc.Overall, this is a film that doesn't just entertain but leaves a lasting impact. You walk away feeling changed-and that kind of cinema is rare.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
9.6/10,"Wow, what a film. This is what cinema is all about, a pure masterclass in storytelling, acting, and emotion. Good Will Hunting is an incredibly acclaimed movie for a reason, delivering a plot that couldn't have been done better. It pulls you in effortlessly with its natural banter and dialogue, making every interaction feel real. Within ten minutes, you're hooked. The way Will's intelligence is revealed is so satisfying: first as an anonymous janitor solving impossible equations, then as a kid in court, recklessly defending himself with sharp wit. The story unfolds in a way that keeps you engaged without ever feeling forced, balancing Will's genius with his emotional struggles and the relationships that shape him.And the performances? Wow. Matt Damon completely disappears into the role, making Will's pain, arrogance, and vulnerability feel heartbreakingly real. Robin Williams delivers an unforgettable performance, bringing warmth and quiet intensity to every scene he's in. Even Ben Affleck's character, though seemingly minor, carries weight, his lines adding real depth to the friendship. He delivered a proper performance, with lines you just can't forget. The bond between the group feels effortless, every conversation so well-written that it almost seems unscripted. And speaking of the script, Damon and Affleck wrote this. Absolute insanity. To have such a degree of talent in acting but simultaneously be incredible at writing, just wow. The dialogue is layered, memorable, and packed with quotes that linger long after the credits roll. Even if the opening credits are a drag, the film is simply brilliant, truly a life-changing movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Good Will Hunting Stands as a Model on How to do a Low-Budget Film Right,"Good Will Hunting's plot follows troubled custodian Will Hunting (Matt Damon) as he tries to navigate relationships and life in 1997 Boston and Cambridge. Throughout the 126 minute film, Will's ego and psyche are challenged by the weathered Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) while finding something inside of himself he did not know he had with Skylar (Minnie Driver). This excellent and complex plot coupled with the outstanding music from the late Elliot Smith create an unforgettable atmosphere from start to finish.The screenplay finds a precise balance between distress and happiness which gives the film a unique footprint for future scripts to follow. The script is penned by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who also has a role in the film. During the writing stage of the production Gus Van Sant- the director of the film- visited Damon and Affleck frequently and later critiqued their writing method in the Introduction to the published screenplay: ""Ben and Matt would fly into action and create something almost spontaneously with Matt standing in the middle of the hotel room demonstratively gesturing and editing ideas by drawing dotted lines in the air with his hands, with Ben writing down dialogue on his laptop computer."" This spontaneous yet structured dialogue can be seen throughout the film, excellently mastered by the acting chops of Robin Williams and film royalty Stellan Skarsgård.Robin Williams delivers a more controlled and stable character as opposed to his mostly zany and comical repertoire. His character arguably grows as much as the main protagonist throughout the film as he needs to open up in order to mentor Will Hunting. In the famous ""pond scene"" Williams delivers- in my opinion- one of the greatest film monologues of all time, creating a father-figure character in less than five minutes. However, Williams does not waste a chance to shine in comedy during a completely improvised scene about two thirds through the film.Independent films today have grown to focus more on art than narrative, which lowers the quality of the film. When there is little-to-no narrative in your film, there is nothing for your audience to connect with. An example of this problem in more modern cinema is the film The Mountain Between Us. While the film captures awe-inspiring landscapes, the dialogue and narrative is so poor it is hard to feel any sort of connection with the characters whatsoever. For reasons and examples like these, this is why I believe that Good Will Hunting stands as a model on how to do a low-budget film right.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Abundance of interesting characters in a polished film,"I was very surprised at the variety and depth of the characters in the GWH script. (This is after all a Hollywood movie.) Several of them (Robin Williams, Minnie Driver and Affleck and his friends) could have been the center of their own movies.Also it is rare when a brat pack type of film does a good job handling adult issues, as was done with William's and Skarsgard's characters coming to terms with what is success, commitment as well as pride and jealousy.The therapist client relationship which can be so off base to be a joke as in the ""Prince of Tides"" had a semblance of reality to it. The intense issue of child abuse was dealt with very briefly but in a fairly honest way.In a sense the story about the Matt Damon character being very bright was not that interesting to me. What I responded to were these characters trying to reach out and connect. This is overall a very polished package by the film makers, including fine acting - making GWH a positive experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A Review: Good Will Hunting by Gus Van Sant,"The Plot1997s Good Will Hunting by Gus Van Saint is an American drama story that follows a troubled unrecognized genius Will Hunting (Matt Damon) who works as a janitor at MIT. Will is ready to spend his days working a minimal wage job and drinking with his buddies on the weekend until he solves a complex math problem and gets the attention of Prof. Gerald Lambeau who decides to help Will achieve his full potential by solving math problems and getting his life back on track with the help of Dr. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Dr. Maguire acts as a therapist to Will, delving into his deepest fears and worries whilst confronting his own underlying issues in the process.ReviewAt first glance, Good Will Hunting seems like a very generic drama with a quite predictable plot, and it is, there is the unrealistically smart genius to whom we could never relate, who despite being so gifted, needs someone else to help him reach his potential. But what really sets this movie apart, is not the plot or crazy unpredictable characters, but the truly realistic and hard-hitting emotions this movie is able to recreate in the viewer's mind. All the characters undergo their own development arch instead of funneling all their screentime into developing only the protagonist, which makes the movie feel way less constricted. You can see the effect of one person directly and significantly impacting another, just like it would in the real world, and most of the time you can really relate and feel those emotions. But the moments where this movie truly shines are the therapy sessions between Will Hunting and Dr. Sean Maguire. They delve deep into the human psyche and emotions, not being afraid of confronting themselves and the viewer with some harsh truths. You can feel the connection they make during the runtime of the film, and Sean becomes almost a guiding father figure to Will. Of course, the character interactions are not the only strong suit of the film. The acting was truly superb, making you believe everything the characters are saying without a doubt. The synergy between Matt Damon and Robin Williams was immaculate.Conclusion and final thoughtsOverall Good Will Hunting is one incredible movie, achieving such emotional realism that is hard to find these days with all the mainstream blockbusters. It is not afraid to present the rather cruel reality of life, while still showing how to create truly meaningful connections and make you relate to almost all the characters in some way or another. I think this movie is a must-watch for any teenager/young adult.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An All Time Great,"This is one of my top films and would recommend to anyone who hasn't had the chance to watch it already.The cast fits the films narrative perfectly. The storyline is extremely compelling while the character development engaging. I've watched this multiple times and keep on coming back to it, it's one of those films with great re-watchability as there always aspects to pick up on that you hadn't realised before.Considering the age of the film it still battles for great cinematography. The backdrops and settings are very put together perfectly illustrating the time the movie was filmed. Overall an absolute class film, receiving the only 10/10 on my roster of movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Inspiring,"This movie is a drama about a young janitor, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) working at MIT who has an immense gift for for learning, but struggles to put it to good use as he tries to find purpose and drive in his life. This movie tells a coming of age story for the complex Will Hunting who is almost equal parts gifted and challenged. This film, a school assignment turned passion project of the co-writers and stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, managed to become a relatable (albeit sometimes unbelievable) experience in a person's struggle to find purpose and balance in their ever changing life.The beauty of this film is primarily achieved through both it's narrative and acting (most notably Robin Williams' timeless performance as the therapist, Dr. Sean Maguire) which both compliment each other really well to make the characters and story really come to life. Beyond that I didn't think the cinematography was anything revolutionary, but was definitely purposeful and well thought out. As an Elliott Smith fan already, I was thrilled to find Good Will Hunting's soundtrack be filled with his songs, featuring some of his most popular tracks, mostly from his famous album ""Either/Or"" with the addition of the song ""Miss Misery"" which he had written specifically for this film. I think Elliott's work fits in perfectly with Good Will Hunting's setting, and I think both mediums complemented each other extremely well, elevating the impact of both the film and the songs, as all good movie sound tracks should aim to do.Overall, I gave this movie a 8 out of 10 as it is not exactly flawless, such as in the writing of Will Hunting's portrayal on screen as a genius, it sort of comes off in a way that makes it feel like the writers had to make everyone else seem dumb in comparison, so that the audience could understand how smart this character is. It's just sort of off putting for the movie to treat this MIT math professor like he doesn't know anything. At the end of the day I'd recommend this film to anyone looking for a powerful and inspiring coming of age story with an impressive cast, great story and awesome soundtrack. Although the premise of a random janitor turning out to be secret genius who can have all the fortune he wants if he chooses to chase it, is a little bit unbelievable and arguably childish, I really don't think that in the end, it takes away from the overall impact this movie aims to deliver to it's audience. The way Good Will Hunting explores themes such as self exploration, love and friendship is impactful and slightly preachy but manages to not come off as pretentious or overly sappy. The relationships between characters in this movie are well developed, realistic and relatable to the point where one could easily put themselves in any character's shoes and understand how and why they feel the way that they do, and how that might impact the next character. A really beautiful story with an inspiring ending.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Excellent job from a couple of Hollywood newbies.,"Good Will Hunting has been acclaimed as one of the most inspirational, tear-jerking films of the late 90's. The script is extremely impressive considering that it came from two Hollywood no-names: Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (Well, they were back then anyways).Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did the impossible by delivering a great script while successfully acting in their first big time film. While watching this film, it is easy to tell how genuine the dialogue really is. The dialogue is then capitalized on by great acting from every actor in the film. Matt, Ben, Robin Williams, and the rest of the cast all hit home-runs with their on screen performance. It is easy for the audience to forget that they are watching actors.It's simple. Unique writing + realistic acting + inspiring story + good cinematography techniques = a darn good movie.
Good Will Hunting fulfills that equation easily.However, the movie does fall a bit short from doing what it could have done . Much of the writing, being focused on realism, did a little too good at its job. Often, we find the screen play diving a bit too deep into dialogue that has little to do with the plot. Sure, its okay to portray the characters and their personalities in their bar-to-bar shenanigans; however, it does not help the flow of emotion that the viewers in the audience need to feel.
Simply put, the film lacks balance. If the film had been a bit more efficient with its comical relief and had spent more time developing the emotion of the characters, big emotional moments in the film would have felt even bigger. It is important that a story line flows with balanced progressive emotion until it hits its apex scene. Good Will Hunting's story line simply lacks the flow as the emotional scenes are scattered between scenes of passive unrelated dialogue. This makes the big emotional moments feel a bit over-dramatic when they arrive.Other than that, this film's screen play his a winning lottery ticket (see what I did there?).Great movie. I would recommend. I watched this film edited to take out the100+ F-bombs and I still enjoyed it very much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Inspiring Movie,"At the heart of Good Will Hunting are its characters, each brilliantly portrayed and intricately layered. Matt Damon's portrayal of Will Hunting, a troubled but extraordinarily gifted young man, is nothing short of captivating. From the outset, we see Will as a janitor at MIT, a genius who can solve complex mathematical problems with ease but struggles with emotional scars from his past. Damon brings a complexity to Will that is both intellectual and deeply vulnerable, making him relatable and compelling.Equally impactful is Robin Williams' portrayal of Sean Maguire, Will's therapist. Williams' performance is a masterclass in empathy and emotional depth. Through Sean, we see a man who has experienced his own profound loss and struggles, yet finds a way to connect with Will on a level that transcends therapy. Their scenes together are poignant and transformative, revealing layers of emotional truth that resonate long after the film ends.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Unbearable !,"10 years ago I've watched it. And it gave me only pain ever since. Pure and clear, I hate this movie. Rather, what's here to love?! Let me tell you, the moment when (Robin Williams) was talking about his wife who farted till she waked herself up, the joke of the girl in the café about old people's sexual perversity, the stupid never-ending lecture about genius guys (which seems copied, as it is, from many books), all of that are little instances for how disgusting and boring this movie is. Actually, this is what lived from it with the poor me. And when it comes to its cast, then let me bleed with hate; (Ben Affleck) is underrated actor, he is, since he isn't hated enough! I just can't stand (Minnie Driver) as an actress. And (Matt Damon) is so cold and unconvincing in mostly all what he does. There is a good story there, but totally murdered by adolescent script and provocatively mute direction. Nothing is beautiful in this movie. And while it's supposed to be touchy, it totally isn't. Save the scene of (Affleck) talking about missing his friend, I didn't enjoy anything.

10/10 Would Reccomend,"Twenty-year-old Will Hunting of South Boston works as a janitor at MIT, despite him being a self-taught mathematical genius. He spends his free time drinking with his friends, Chuckie, Morgan, and Billy. After solving a difficult high-level math problem on a chalkboard in the hallways of MIT, his talent is discovered by Professor Lambeau, who decides to help Will reach his full potential. When Will gets in a fight and is arrested for attacking a police officer, Professor Lambeau takes a deal to get leniency for Will if he gets treatment from therapist Sean Maguire. Although the movie plunges into and addresses the emotions of each character, like the psychological trauma that Will experiences, it still manages to incorporate lots of humor. There are many instances where the witty banter and hilarious exchanges, especially between Will and his friends, cause the audience to immediately respond with a laugh.
 ""Good Will Hunting"" was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who portray the two best friends, Will and Chuckie. One might stipulate that the writing and on-screen connection between the two would be mediocre, considering that Damon and Affleck were just in college when they began writing the script and the fact that they were not the big named actors that they are now. But, because Damon and Affleck are actually childhood besties in really life, they make the friendship between Will and Chuckie (and even with Billy and Morgan) all the more authentic. Their friendship and loyalty towards each other is the glue that keeps the movie together; they accept each other for who they are. The already well established relationship between Damon and Affleck reinforces their performances, reminding the audience that family does not just come in one form. Damon and Affleck didn't just grow up as best friends, they also grew up on Boston, which is where the movie is set. The movie included many scenes that were actually shot in the city. For example, the famous scene where Sean has a heart-to-heart talk with Will at a park was actually shot at Boston Public Garden. The movie has had such an impact on audiences that the bench where the conversation took place became a memorial for Robin Williams after his passing.
 Not only is the bond between Will and Chuckie unmistakable, but also their character development throughout the movie. Usually, the main character in a movie is moving towards a goal and the audience is rooting for them along the way. But, in this film, that is not the case. Will Hunting is not someone who embraces his intellectual gift and, in fact, seems to be against accepting it at all. This sort-of creates a frustration in the audience which, in turn, makes them root for him even more since they want him to learn to embrace it. The movie may seem typical-about some genius kid-but it actually touches upon two very important topics. First off, it addresses the psychology of Will. The movie dives into the psychology of Will and how the psychological traumas from his past have affected him all the way to adulthood. Also, in the movie, Will is faced with a decision: to use his intellectual gift to its full potential, or to pursue love. Just like how Chuckie hopes for Will to be gone one day when he comes to pick him up, the audience wishes for Will to embrace his gift and reach his full potential. But, it isn't that simple for Will and he has to learn to follow his heart and what he thinks is best for him. This screenplay, written by Damon and Affleck was nominated and won an Academy Award, as well as a Golden Globe, for ""Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen"".
 Just by looking at the cast, you can tell that the acting is going to be top-notch. Every role in this movie was cast perfectly and the actors performances were always in-character. The chemistry between Minnie Driver (Skylar) and Matt Damon (Will) is undeniable. Even though Damon wasn't yet a big-named actor, his performance was powerful. Skylar and Will's interactions were effortless, making the audience root for them without the writers needing to keep all the focus on them throughout the movie. No one could play the role of Sean better than Robin Williams. The dialogue that he delivered in the Boston Public Garden became so famous and resonated with so many that, when he passed, the bench where he delivered it became a memorial for him. Robin Williams won an Academy Award for ""Best Actor in a Supporting Role"" for his wonderful performance as Will's therapist/mentor, Sean. The performances were incredibly powerful and believable, and definitely one of the biggest reasons why this movie was so successful and is so loved.
 Despite the frequent use of vulgar language and the predictability of the overarching plot, ""Good Will Hunting"" is still definitely worth a watch. Although the opening minutes of the movie are slow, the movie as a whole presents a refreshingly enjoyable story of a mathematical genius who is, unexpectedly, relatable as he struggles with the psychological trauma from his past as well as the task of finding his true purpose in life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

What a great movie it is,"Good Will Hunting absolutely deserves the label ""Timeless Classic"" and with very good reasons: the movie not only asks the viewers to question the importance that high-education provides in a society in which the elite thrive but also to ask the same very basic question that Sean Robin Williams asks Will Matt Damon""What do you want?""With fantastic storyline-progression, real humanperformances and dialog which will remain etched in your mind forever make no mistake: you can watch this movie in any year and in any time and it will still have the same impact.""How do you like them apples?"" will be a rhetorical question you can't wait to use after you watch this.

Overshadowed by the Big Boat,"If it weren't for that damn Titanic movie(don't get me wrong I didn't hate Titanic) the Best Picture Race would've been a lot more interesting. The Full Monty still would've been a long shot but that leaves you with three of the greatest movies in recent years: L.A Confidential, As Good As it Gets, and my personal favorite, Good Will Hunting. Good Will Hunting is a movie masterpiece. Matt Damon and Ben Afleck are sensational actors and even better writers. Robin Williams finally got an Oscar(long overdue) for what I think might be his best performance yet, second only to Dead Poets Society. The chemistry between Williams and Damon is remarkable. Minnie Driver was great too. This is definitely a must see!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Good and Chill Movie, Nothing Spectacular :)","It's not a bad movie, but I think it's a bit overpraised.Matt Damon was my favorite actor when I was growing up and now I'd say he's still in there somewhere :)Damon and Affleck's script certainly deserves the admiration it has received and the acting, including that of the great Robin Williams, is not to be missed!The story is very well told and I can see why it gets the acclaim that the film has, but I just found the story a bit trite and not all that interesting. Nothing special.However, given the aforementioned positives, I can't deny that I enjoyed the film. It's cool, it's worth a watch and I would recommend it by the way.Final score: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Moving coming of age story - but not for me.,"It is for sure a great movie, me personally wasn't really 'grapped' by it. I appreciate the strong story line and the strong characters which are exposed gracefully.

But might not rewatch it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Not So Good Will Hunting,"Good Will Hunting is a story about a genius who for various reasons has not been able to take advantage of this and, when we are introduced to him in the film, is working as a cleaner at a university. This guy's name is Will Hunting and he is played by Matt Damon. He solves a ridiculously difficult maths problem and is found by a maths teacher at the school played by Stellan Skarsgård. And it goes from there.I think that if I had watched this movie when it was released, prior to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's careers, I would've been able to enjoy it much more. Since they have both written the script and play leading roles in the film it's hard not to judge it with this in mind. Neither Damon nor Affleck appear to be people who would pick fights, rather they appear to be people who would avoid something like that to a large extent in order to not danger their good looks. They are very much cast against type, but that ties in with the fact that most likely one of the main reasons they wrote this script was to shape roles for themselves to launch their respective careers. I would have no problem with this, if this was a good movie, which unfortunately, it is not. Minnie Driver also is not good looking enough for her part to be believable.Gus Van Sant is one of my favorite directors, although I find his later more ""experimental"" movies - like Elephant, Paranoid Park and Psycho - much more rewarding as opposed to his earlier work which is more conventional and main stream. The main problem with this film though lies within the script, so I suppose he did what he could with what he was given in this case. For a movie to be entertaining, gripping and interesting, you need a conflict. I fail to find such a thing in this motion picture, and I did look for it the entire running time.It is a mystery as to what you are supposed to feel for the main character in this film. It is hard to feel pity for him since he himself is the main obstacle to getting what he wants, success, money, respect and so on. Many people try to help him but he fights them with all he has got. He has the personality of a spoiled brat (funny enough that in the picture this is the very opposite of what he is supposed to be: A poor bastard who has had to fight his way to survive). It is also hard to identify with him since a very small percentage of the viewers of this film are geniuses who has not had to lift a finger to get where they are.It's easier to understand the problems of this movie if you compare it to a film about a similar subject which actually works. In Rain Man the main character truly is pitiful. His fate is a sad one since he is gifted but his disability has rendered him unable to interact normally with other people. The film is gripping since the viewer feels for the main character and his brother trying so desperately to reach him and find a place for him in this world.In a word you can sum up this film as plastic or fake: It's a pseudo-intellectual movie of the worst sort, it tries to go deep but only scratches the surface. A positive: Robin Williams does a great job with his role, he always seems to do better when he is given a serious part to play. When I saw Matt Damon in this film all I could think of was his involuntary part in Team America: World Police. ""MATT DAMON!"". Even though he was played by a doll in that film, his part seemed more real than in Good Will Hunting.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Incredible Performances,"This is some of Robin Williams best work. Before watching this movie all I knew was that it was a written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. I think the pacing is good, plot is developed and I really enjoyed the dynamic between Robin Williams and Matt Damon. Great film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Great writing,"A very engaging film with good dialogue, with an academic and therapy backdrop.There is some fruity gritty language, romantic drama and one or two action scenes.This was well written by Damon and Affleck at relatively youthful ages.There are good interactions between the characters. Particularly so, Sean and Will, Chuckie and Will and Skylark and Will. The acting is to a high standard all-round.One scene appears to have been influenced somewhat by Cyrano de Bergerac. Robin Williams gives a pared-down performance with just a couple of moments of trademark tomfoolery. I enjoyed Minnie Driver's performance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Hunting is a believable character,"I did not think this movie was great, but I did like it.  However, I do not feel the characters in this movie are unrealistic, as some have complained. I felt the character of Will Hunting, who seems to be the most maligned, was very real.  Maybe the problem is that people have gotten so used to seeing characters who are one-dimensional and non-contradictory, even though this is not what people are like in real life.  Will Hunting is a mathematical genius, but this in no way means that he should behave intelligently in all domains of his life.  Hence, it is not unrealistic for him to behave stupidly when it comes to women.  Nor is it unrealistic for him to work as a janitor.  In my experience, people often do things that could not be predicted from their intelligence or abilities alone.  I myself have done things that I intellectually knew were stupid or detrimental; I'm sure most people have, and a mathematical genius should be no exception.  The character of Hunting struck me very much as a guy who has a problem with sabotaging his own happiness and success, maybe out of fear of greater failure should he put himself on the line.  His amazing abilities do not necessitate that he have a good job and a university degree, because it is not just intelligence that determines these things.  In school, perhaps he skipped all his classes and never did his assignments, and thus got poor grades.  That being the case, he would not have been accepted to a prestigious university, and in fact no one might have noticed his affinity for math.  It is also possible he simply didn't apply to university, even though he might have been accepted, either to stay with his friends or to prevent academic failure.  I think one of the points of this movie is that being gifted does not by itself make you happy and successful.  Being gifted does not make you immune to psychological problems, or make you behave in an intelligent manner in all situations.  If his character had been written this way- well, first off, there wouldn't be a movie.  Secondly, that would have made his character completely unbelievable.  I do concede that the likelihood of a genius being a janitor is not that great, but it is not impossible, and I'm sure it happens.  There are historical figures that we now recognise as great, even though in their time they were ignored or ridiculed for their beliefs.  There are also nutty geniuses, who cut off their ears and what not.  In light of such things and of my own personal experiences, I don't see any reason why Hunting can't be as screwed up as the rest of us.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Would have liked it better if it had been hyped less,"I finally got around to seeing this film and frankly, with all the hype that surrounded it when it was new, I had expected something better.  It's interesting that it's a film written by two childhood friends and that they made it big.  It's less interesting as a film, period.  Don't get me wrong; it's not really a BAD movie, it's just an average movie with nothing terribly surprising, innovative, or new, and it had a big reputation to live up to.The concept of a genius in janitors' clothing was new to me, and while it's refreshing to see a topic in a movie that hasn't been in a hundred movies before, the way the rest of the story played out was somewhat predictable. Didn't mean I didn't like it, just that I wasn't surprised by it.  I was expecting something a bit more surprising or shocking, and frankly the only thing shocking about this movie was the language.  Couldn't it have been made without quite so much profanity?Some of the lines were quite a pleasure to watch -- especially Will's brainy monologues.  And the acting was all around quite good, especially by Minnie Driver and the two leading male characters (Matt Damon's Will and Ben Affleck's character).

GOOD WILL HUNTING (DIDIER BECU),"Normally I hate films with good messages but this one was different and there are different reasons for it. Just let me tell that I couldn't believe my eyes when I noticed this movie was ranked among the 250 best movies ever as that's certainly not the case as it's the kind of movie you have seen before...It's the story about some janitor (Matt Damon) who happens to be a math-genius but he prefers to hang out with his friends (Ben Affleck) beating up some guys. Everything changes till he met Sean, a psychiatrist (Robin Williams). Matt Damon plays his role in a perfect way and he could be one of the better actors of these days as he plays the streetguy in a pure James dean/Marlon Brando-way, tons better than Affleck who seems a bit lost here. And finally a normal Robin Williams and it's a shame noticing how great his acting is, how much he can handle and knowing he wasted so many talent in c**p like ""Toys"".""Good will hunting"" is a great movie that deserves two hours of your time, but not a place in the Top 250.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Robin Williams Stole Burt Reynolds Oscar!!,"This awful movie made a lot of money, but that doesn't mean it was good, as a matter of fact it was excruciating. Yet another over rated movie that was simply painful and boring to watch. This story is so preposterous, poorly acted it makes me crazy. This is an insult to cinema goers,with Robin Williams playing the same character he did in Dead Poets Society, Awakenings and Patch Adams and for that alone it is just plain despicable.No other film was as clichéd and pathetic as this was. I cannot remember a film so pointless and laughable as this dreadful movie was. In a year of so many horrible films, this was the worst excuse for a film I can think of. This film was so torturous I cannot put it into words. I detested every second. I am mad that I wasted my life by seeing this idiotic film.

Perfect square of denail and uncertainty of the lead role. Perfect square of professor and psychiatrist classmates and link to the lead role. Perfect square of friends and love life of lead role.

I love it!,"I cherish the moment in Good Will Hunting where Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams, converses with Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, on a park bench about life, love, and identity. The scene is more than just a dialogue. It is a monologue delivered with exceptional passion by Robin Williams, which always gives me goosebumps. Many other scenes in the movie have also left me in awe, such as the conversation between Sean Maguire and Professor Lambeau about ego and missed opportunities and the scene where Sean narrates Game 6 of the World Series to Will. The final scene between Will and Sean is also remarkable, but I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie. The screenplay by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck is one of my favorites, and it has many great moments that I love. Even the scenes between Matt Damon and Ben Affleck or Damon and Minnie Driver are exceptional, but I still can't mention them in my top five favorite scenes because there are so many great moments in the movie. It is simply one of the best-written movies ever made, and Robin Williams gave his best performance in it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Close, but no cigar","Good Will Hunting is a good movie, no question. It is a long way, however, from a great movie.

This movie is not worth all the hoopla (and awards) it garnered, something I can only attribute to Ben and Matt's 'fresh' faces.

The first hour was great but Matt Damon's shtick gets old very fast after that!,"So I'm watching this for the first time ever. I find Matt Damon's character interesting. I can't get my eyes off his nose, and how much better looking he was with a very fat nose. (WHO decided that LaToya shrunken noses were attractive?!) And what a pity he had it redone. (Reminded me of Michelle Williams and how impossibly gorgeous she was with that fat nose of hers in Dawson's Creek and how Yerevan-waxwork she now looks when she had it cut to play that skunk with an A, marilyn monroe!)Anyway, I like old movies, so at first I'm like ""Hey! Movies in the 90s were good, even if I didn't like them and didn't watch them then."" Damon is captivating with his mind-games. Then Robin Williams appears and I have to scramble here: he actually made 2 similar movies?? I thought I was watching Dead Poets Society??? Hmm...blackboard, RW teaching kids and chalk. 2 movies the same year, yeah??And what does Good Will Hunting mean? See? That's why I never bothered with this film: not only was the overhype a killer for me at the time... (if you're one of those idiots who runs to the movies cos everyone is talking at the office of a film you don't know and you wanna be one of the ""cool kids"" at the office... you're an idiot!!! I was there to work, not socialize with morons!) ...but I couldn't understand the title. WHO wants to see a movie that says ""Good Will Hunting"". Will... is that a verb? Is that the noun, as in ""you have strong will""? Obviously ""hunting"" is the verb. So what does a will (inheritance?) have to do with chasing foxes with dogs? I don't like hunting already! I love foxes. Is this gonna be a pretentious British movie where everyone talks funny? (Yep: Minnie Driver, the poor man's Mimi Rogers, actually ruined her career trying to outdo Meg Ryan a la ""Hack Twah!"" I think that's why she offed herself as she could never work in this town again.)Anyway, Robin Williams. He's dead. Awww... let me go get my violin. Never liked the guy. But the dynamic psychologist/patient is solid. What is Ben Affleck doing in this movie? ""I wrote it, we drew straws and I lost and my buddy gets the good part now? I better start drinking my troubles away...."" (Is this how his J-Lo cheating ways started??)Anyway this is a movie for all the young girls who are still so stupid they say: ""But I can change him!"" No, you can't and you ain't! (Ask J-Lo) Watch Matt Damon's character and learn.For the rest, the movie goes downhill fast in part 2. Is it in hour 2? IDK. It gets tedious. I lost interest. I started tinkering on my PC since I was forced to search and find out there were TWO 3-word films starring chalk, kids, blackboards and Robin Williams (do I have to watch DPS now??) and there ya go. Every once in a while I glanced up and I was bored so I read reviews.When RW started ""It's not your fault"", I already knew it was coming so I was unimpressed other than thinking did it take Matty 45 takes to start bawling Also, it made me think about killers rotting in jail for offing paid d'oh!-zes cos no one ever told THEM it was not their fault.Bla bla bla. First part of the movie is a 10/10. It crumbles down somewhere in the middle and now I have no idea how it ends but I don't care.

Perfect,"I watch this movie every 3 or 4 months, and it is never planned, I will just be looking for a movie to watch, and then I come across this and it is better than any other movie I will find. I am a sucker for feel-good, life lessons learned, and somewhat romantic movies, and this fits that perfectly.The emotions that are conveyed throughout the entire film feel genuine and real, and it makes you really connect and almost root for the characters to do the right things.The background of knowing Damon hangs around a group of guys that have lived in the same place all their life, working construction and drinking beer, getting in fights and running from the cops really sets the stage for who he is.Robin Williams was so perfect in his role, and the relationship they build in the short two hours we have for the film is truly inspiring, because in a way they helped each other.My two favorite scenes are by far the Pudge Fisk home run scene and the ""It's not your fault"" scene.

Very Nice,"Psychological drama well in the beginning of Ben Aflleck and Matt Damon in their careers - they star (with Matt in the role of the protagonist) and wrote the script together. The director was Gus Van Sant (Drugstore Cowboy).The movie tells a story about a irish-descendant boy in Boston that works as janitor in a mathematics faculty, and it is a self-taught genius, with a troubled past and present - some mathematical riddles are left by the head of the chair in the faculty (Skarsgård) and mysteriously solved by night. Catching up with Matt Damon character Will he can be out of parole if he gets a job and consult with a psychiatrist what shows to be a tid bit tough thing.The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $225 million during its theatrical run against a $10 million budget, and received nominations in nine categories, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won in two: Best Supporting Actor for Williams and Best Original Screenplay for Affleck and Damon. Nothing bad, at all for someone being just out of Harvard University. Anther curiosity: character Skylar in the movie have the same name and background of Matt Damon's girlfriend back then.Robin Williams acts as the psychiatrist that could connect with this troubled boy, in a solid role - speaking of solid role it was nice to see Matt Damon out of some action movie in really nice drama scenes. Another actor that shows up is Stellan Skarsgård, yes the father of the four sons the most known being Bill (of ""It"").Nice heartwarming moving movie thought the end with a solid script. I would scorre it a 8.0 out of 10.0 / B+. It is strange that I didn't even reminded this one back in 97, but then I remembered that that year I was in the 3rd year of Medicine so not much time to seeing movies I guess.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Good film, but no classic","I have to admit that I enjoyed this film when it came out, much more than the heralded Titanic.  Its formulaic elements (the story is a meeting between Ordinary People and Little Man Tate) were appealing.Does it have it's flaws.  Yes.  It does go on a bit too long, and Minnie Driver's character borders on caricature.  But the rest of the film is amazing.Matt Damon sparks life into his already great role.  In a year where young actors did their best to impress, Matt Damon rode out on top (along with Edward Norton).  His performance is full of charm.  Robin Williams won a long-deserved oscar for a great performance, though it doesn't top his best (Mrs. Doubtfire).  The directing by Gus Van Sant is good, but doesn't top his best either (Drugstore Cowboy).All in all, a very good film, one that I will see again, but it isn't a classic.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
My thoughts,"Good Will Hunting was a good movie, it shows that love can go a long way and in all different ways. Will Hunting double thinks but ends up going with his gut, i thought he should of went with the girl before she left. I see me in Will Hunting i double think but i go and get what i want, people judge Will even though they don't really know him people do that with me too. He has a different way of doing stuff and he's underestimated by others.
People don't think Will Hunting knows what he's talking about or doing because he's younger than them. But Will Hunting actually knows what he's talking about and doing, he's a smart guy. It doesn't better how young you are if you actually know what your talking about don't listen to what people got to say. Age doesn't matter if you know what your talking about. Will Hunting is a person who doesn't care what people say about him he would still go and do anything to help himself.
The only thing i didn't like was the cliffhanger in the end of the movie. I just wanted to see if he really made it to her or even to see if he married this girl. I rate this movie a 7, besides the ending i liked the whole movie. Will Hunting went with what his friends said they told him to go with his dreams without telling them when he's leaving and that's what he did. It was a great movie and i recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Damon's career defining performance,"'Good Will Hunting' is one of the best known and most popular films of the 90s. It's a powerful, moving drama about an unlikely friendship and features some of the best and most memorable acting performances of that decade, including a career defining performance from Matt Damon as the title character.It's easy to become emotionally involved in this film as you naturally want the main character to succeed. The friendship he forms with Robin Williams' character is hugely enjoyable and even despite the slow pacing, the story is engaging enough to hold the viewers attention throughout. While not a personal favourite of mine, it's easy to see why 'Good Will Hunting' is loved by so many people, and deserves its reputation as one of the best films of the 90s.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An over-rated drama for popular culture,"It's very predictable that a movie like this would soon be placed into that undefined category of ""good"" recent movies, which includes any film having the smallest bit of sincerity and meaning. The fact that the popular trend is toward the visual and that special effects are replacing plots and subtle nuances tends to lead the average viewer to the opinion that any film that attempts these is a grand effort. This is not true. ""Good Will Hunting"" does not even have a well-defined plot, but that fits into the movie acceptably: it's an extraordinary man's search for himself through love, psychoanalysis, and philosophy. The premier problem is that the movie overplays it's best card: Matt Damon's(character's) incredible brain. There is a certain point at which the audience should halt its fascination at his mental profencies and sigh in boredom. It's unfortunate that this was not the case for most theaters. Though the meaning of life and gifted individuals are good themes for movies, they are not original, and this ""tear-jerker"" makes no unique contributions to either idea. In fact, if you want to see real meaning in a popular movie, rent ""Rocky"", a title which many supposed ""film experts"" would probably not want to admit conveys deeper human meaning than most ""good"" movies, like (appropriately) Good Will Hunting.

A script that shows much thought and honesty,"Good Will Hunting is a movie which you don't need to be a genius to understand, you just have to be awake. It is a continually rewarding movie which offers something new each time you see it. A natural reaction the first time one sees Good Will Hunting is to focus on the story of Will, his mathematical genius and his past experience with people. Then the next time you start to realize that they don't overly stress the genius aspect, but simply use it as a way of him to become ""something."" Then you get the conflict between Skaarsgard and Williams about which destiny is best for Will, obviously stretching from some long-standing problems between them. And there's infinitely more. Damon and Affleck both cared very much about what they put into their screenplay, and it shows. If you don't care, then no matter how many special effect you can pour into it, it will never be as good as a movie that you pour yourself into. That is the difference between this movie and so many sub-par excuses.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I give the movie a 7.5/10, mainly due to some of the smart dialogue, and the strong performance from Robin Williams. Other than that the rest of the actors weren't that special. Matt Damon and Minnie Driver are not especially convincing, and I did not see much chemistry between the two. I hope Matt Damon's performance in Rounders is better.

Excellent...except for Matt Damon,"A janitor at a MIT is secretly a genuis.

Unfortunately, he plays the lead character...Will Hunting.He's ugly, mean, sarcastic and gives an absolutely horrible performance.  He wears the same blank expression all through the movie.  Everybody else around him are great and they really carry the show.Some people have criticized the movie for its frequent profanity, but that's how guys from South Boston talk.  Also Affleck and Damon were born and raised in Cambridge so they have authentic Boston accents.  It helps the tone of the film immensely.So, it's a very very good film.

"First Script, Brilliant, the wonder-boys,  Ben and Matt.","I was just starting to write stories, scripts, in my spare time. I wanted to get the form down, so for me, just writing was an exercise in itself. I was putting together a rather simple, down and out story nothing special. Writing in early 97'.I had heard a story on how Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had put this script together and had 'shopped' it all over Hollywood and were both kind of ready to sell it, even for a 'piece of chicken' (Jokingly they said in an interview) but they were sort of at their wits'-end when....- it finally happened.Then, look what happened...2 Oscars, 16 other awards and 34 nominations on top of that! Why? Two reasons I can find. First off, they did not give up, or give in to the temptation to finally quit. The other, and this is just a 'shot in the dark' but, the movie was victorious. No, arguments can truly take solid ground against the film, other than yes, they had an affinity for the 'F'-word.These 'Southies' were really playing the 'streeters' of Boston to steely perfection. They were who they set out to be in their writing. I was amazed, this story touched deeply. they showed the struggle and the belief in and they all sort of had a love for their 'Brilliant' janitor friend, knowing that he is destined for more than they were going to encounter in life. And they still stood up for him and with him on everything from street fights to getting him in the end to embrace what he needed to do and follow and not fear the great task ahead of him. The biggest thing for me in this story is the element of distrust, that came from Matt's Character. He was abused by his dad and through that impact that started the massive down-slide (avalanche) of destructive behavior and thoughts of uselessness in himself. He was almost brought to a place that he might not return, as he didn't feel that he could love or give anything to Skyler, because he was scared of love itself. What should have been there at his childhood home (love) was abandoned to an evil overlord that was nothing more than a 'liability' to his life and personal growth. His biological father became a 'bully' worse than any kid at school on the playground.They even brought back some classic seventies tunes that I had forgotten for years, I enjoyed the way that they, placed the music in the different sequences, it was just right. To boot, Matt's character needs to keep the !! Skylar loved him, and he would eventually learn to love other than what he had known before, new and more openly.When the movie ended I was no less than blown away. As a matter of fact I got scared. I was so intimidated, that I stopped writing. Than I heard about the Oscar wins. Robin's first I think it was. And the other wins and nominations and I thought, after a while later, if I quit, I may miss having something to offer to my friends and family, maybe even this country. So I looked at their example and remembered what I took away from the movie and put it back together again for myself.This one is an inspiration all around. This was a winner through and through! It may have been crass and vulgar and just slightly violent, but that just identified the plot of the story as it got going.They deserved every award that they received.This goes beyond just movie for me, it's not as some have been merely entertainment, but it strikes me like life does sometimes, even when God wants to get through to us. We just need to listen and then do the 'right' thing. But we have to follow through for anything good to happened.I recommend this Gus Van Sant, directed and gifted film highly.If you can't get passed the expletives.... check out Cleanfilms.com on the web.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A moving and fantastic movie. I never get tired of this film!,"Good Will Hunting is the film that was unlucky to have been made in the same year as Titanic. Sadly while Titanic left with 13, it left Good Will Hunting with only 2, and unfairly so. For while no one denies that Titanic was impressive enough, Good Will Hunting should have left with the credit it deserved. This combination of Gus Van Sant's direction and the divine writing of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck was one of the best films that I have ever seen. You are greeted with Will Hunting, a sadly disturbed guy who has the most amazing mind, yet can not make himself take advantage of this gift because he is afraid of the consequences. The film looks stunning, with excellent use of camera angles, while the relationships between the various characters develop with so much sincerity that you can really empathise with them. The stars of the piece are not Damon and Affleck however, but Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard, as the shrink who is able to get into the head of brilliant young Hunting and the genius maths professor who discovers Hunting and then spends the rest of the film wishing that he hadn't. The casting of Robin Williams in the serious role of Sean Maguire is excellent; after all Williams often performs his best work when allowed to take off the comic mask that he is so well known for. There is little I can find to criticise this movie with, sometimes the music fails to live up to what it could, but that is just nit-picking! When I saw this, I had already seen Titanic and after, I went to see Titanic again. It was then that I realised that the main element of the film that was any good was the actual sinking of the ship, and that the other two and a half hours were merely there to keep you going to build you up to the ship sinking. If you are looking for a movie to show the development of a relationship between two people, watch Good Will Hunting. Good Will Hunting gives you the hope that things can work out in the end. Also if you have the option, I urge you to listen to the audio commentary that you can get on the DVD, and see how things developed during the making of this utterly superb film.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Hollywood's romanticized view of academia or the myth of the ""natural-born genius""","Recently, I watched Good Will Hunting (1997) starring Matt Damon and Robin Williams. Overall, the acting was well-executed, with all actors delivering solid performances. In particular, Matt Damon shone in his role, while Robin Williams convincingly portrayed the empathic psychoanalyst. The cinematography was unremarkable but didn't detract from the story.However, I found the script problematic. It contained many harmful messages typical of 1990s Hollywood and pretended to be realistic while promoting a false moral. My criticism focuses on the character of Will and his storyline. The main issue was the unrealistic portrayal of Will's genius, from his exaggerated arrogance to his sudden mastery of complex subjects like mathematics and chemistry. The movie implied that his genius was innate rather than the result of dedicated study and practice, which is unrealistic. For instance, in one scene, Will compares himself to Beethoven and Mozart, implying that they were able to play without any practice. This message is incorrect because both Beethoven and Mozart devoted countless hours to perfecting their craft. The fact that Will can excel at subjects so different and far away as Mathematics and Chemistry can't be a gift of nature. The only way to achieve this level of expertise is through practice and study. How can Will, a very young kid that spends his nights at the bar and his days on construction site, know more than a professor that has dedicated his life to the subject? Throughout the movie we are never shown Will studying or exercising or practicing Mathematics.It's necessary to go through formal learning to understand Mathematics. In this movie, however, an extremely genius teenager easily freestyles the field of Mathematics. In a dialogue, Professor Lambeau examines the work of the genius boy, and says: ""I see you used Maclaurin here."" And Will replies: ""Yeah, I don't know what you call it, but..."". This is pure manipulation. The writers of this film deceive the uneducated audience giving a perception of Mathematics so far away from what it really is. I'm not saying people can't excel at something without a college education, but fields like Mathematics and Chemistry require countless hours of practice, complicated instruments and laboratories (especially for Chemistry). In a later scene Will conquers the young girl solving her Chemistry problem, showing apparently better skills at Chemistry than a pre-med student. Finally, I didnt really like either the ludicrous and totally out of touch way the university world was represented.I know very little about Psychology, but I'm wondering if the way Damon and Affleck have dealt with this topic could be as accurate as the way they approached Mathematics. The movie suggested that all traditional psychologists are incompetent and that a special, unconventional psychologist was needed to treat Will's problems. What really surprised me, however, was the way Will's problem was solved suddenly in a single scene (very well acted by the two leads, I have to admit). However, psychological problems are not solved easily and quickly, as the movie suggests. It takes a lot of time, effort, and often involves relapses. Psychology is not magic.A better comparison to this movie would be A Beautiful Mind (2001), which portrayed mathematics and psychology more realistically. It conveyed the message of overcoming difficulties with dedication and commitment, while Good Will Hunting portrayed genius as a magical gift.By contrast, Good Will Hunting approaches these same topics in a way that feels closer to the fantasy world of Harry Potter. How to explain the acclaim this movie receives? The public likes stories about aberration and Will is aberrant, to the point that it seems like magic to a normal person who struggled through calculus in high school. The public likes the idea that humans can diverge from normal development so much that it seems superhuman. I can appreciate this concept in a fantasy or super hero movie, but I found it off-key in this movie. All in all I found the portrayal of genius and psychology in this movie unrealistic and misleading.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Matt Damon was pretty much perfect (I loved him in the scene where him and Minnie Driver get into the huge argument), and my heart went out to Robin Williams unforgettable character (remember the park scene? It doesn't get much better than that!). Ben Affleck was also a bright point, his performance was great (I actually thought he deserved a nomination as well for his acting, but what can ya do?)

Utter tosh,"I'm amazed that this spume ever got close to winning an Oscar.

Where do I start? Hollywood in its purest form is a place (a fantasy) where we are taken and everything is wonderful. But this kind of Hollywood is just a pretend world which is not real and not uplifting either, it neither corresponds to an ideal or a real, it is just pap. It is a depressed fantasy of a reality that never existed. The idea that you have a genius cleaning a college corridor and filling out maths equations on a blackboard, and then having a verbal fist fight with a student at a bar by quoting lots of long words and phrases at him, which will really impress the girl at the bar with the English accent is just so lame, why would anybody think that that was cleaver.

Brilliant love story,"Besides, Will Hunting's great story, thoughtful conversations, developed characters' traits, attractive narrative, even some mathematical proofs, there is intriguing love story. The relationships between Will and Skylar is not a kind of relationship that only genius as Will might have. They loved each other, and both had struggle to accept this fact. For Will, as a mathematician he likes certainty in all things, and long relationships for him are uncertain. He keeps asking himself whether this girl is right choice and where he would be after. As for Skylar, she seeks for education and she needs from him confirmation of his love. The story tells that the right girl is the one for whom you are willing to sacrifice the most valuable thing. I personally find this idea attractive, because it seems to be one of the important decisions and there is only one moment in your life when you will have such feeling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A well-made rather than a well-filled head ...,"Among the cinematic characters that I immediately identified with, there is « Good Will Hunting », though I'm not fortunate enough to be gifted with the same intelligence ... BUT I know how it feels not to exploit one's own talents for his personal life and constantly try to find excuses for that.The story is probably one of the most inspiring and best written scripts from the last two decades, and to think that Matt Damon is the co-writer, with his childhood friend, Ben Affleck – they both played best buddies in the film- makes it even more realistic and inspiring. In fact, there is something that always works in the stories where the screenwriter and the lead actor are the same, take ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Great Dictator"", ""Rocky"", ""Sling Blade"" or the vast majority of Woody Allen's films, the character is written and played by the same actor, he's his own mind, and own body, there is an authentic feeling as if the man doesn't even play. The script is personal, and the film is only an excuse to transcend something personal into a biggest project that would create a wider appeal. And I would never say enough how ""Good Will Hunting"" appealed to me.The story, is about a kid, a tough kid, an extremely intelligent tough kid who grew in South Boston and lived the kind of childhood that could have been laughably cliché had the movie been handled by a bad director or editor. But the revelations of his past go so smoothly that Will Hunting, despite his good intentions, appears more like an arrogant prick than a victim, and THIS is interesting. To depict him as a victim would have considerably changed the value of his gift, it would have been the solution of his problems while in fact, it works like a double-edged sword. Will has an extraordinary power of abstraction, or memorization, of understanding that he can solve the toughest Maths problems, can speak of History, Geography, Politics, Economics, Philosophy, like you'd speak about the one thing that passionate you the most, and he probably knows better than you even in that field. Basically, Will makes you feel dumb, or useless, or unable to use your own knowledge. Even the professor Gerald Lambeau, who'll try to find a future for Will, ends up like a Salieri recognizing his worthless value compared to Will, the Mozart of Mathematics.But the key of the story is to understand the reasons of Will's behavior, which obviously would lead him to a dead-end. When you think about it, his intelligence saved him from jail, which allowed him to know his girlfriend. Speaking of her, let's get back to the scene where they meet. The scene is probably one of the most memorable cinematic ""ownage"" where Will avenges his best friend who was victim of a literally intellectual bullying by an arrogant Harvard prick. Will puts him in his place with the idea that it doesn't takes studies to be intelligent, it takes enough curiosity to learn more than what we're intended to and then try to put that knowledge into perspective. An excellent lesson about how to use our intelligence. But then something ambiguous happens, when Will meets his therapist, Sean Maguire, Robin Williams in a quite perfect performance. Will acts with him exactly the same way the Harvard boy did, using his knowledge to try to push him down. But instead of being upset, Sean feels the potential of Will and a nice retort for the next meeting. ""Do you think I would understand how it feels to be an orphan because I read Oliver twist?"" Will knows, but his knowledge is theoretical, there's the tragic feeling of emptiness governing his life. Life is about guts, heart, emotions, and Sean, animated by a growing fatherly love, will try to open Will's heart, so he can give his life a meaning as Sean obviously found something in Will, to get out from his self-pitied widow condition, a man lost in his memories with no better future.Will Hunting is not a bad guy, as implies the title's adjective. But he fears rejection, and hangs out with the same group which work like an indirect carapace. He's certainly not incapable of being friendly, in love or having fun, but as soon as things go serious, he becomes defensive. The movie provides a fascinating character study in the real sense of the world, we are put in the shoes of a psychiatrist and try to understand Sean's motives, and why Will is such a hard nut to crack. It's an intelligent movie about intelligence, and that respects our intelligence, and more than that, the intelligence of the film is carried by an excellent script that brings so many moments of verbal delights. Will's speeches are priceless; it's like reciting a whole book, with coherence and inspiration. And the films question our visions of intelligence : for Lambeau, it's Excellence, for Maguire, it's Happiness. The inspiring message of the film, is that Will Hunting can reconcile between both. Inspiring is indeed a word that rhymes with ""Good Will Hunting"". And I think Minnie Driver deserves a mention as the one who drove the heart element of the film, as Skylar –why did they had to name her like that anyway-, who had such a genuine feeling, I thought her romance and break-up created another authentic dimension in Will's multi-layered personality.""Good Will Hunting"" is an exploration into the complexities of human relationships, and on a self-reflexive approach, the conclusion of the film is like a mathematical problem finally solved, but human relationships is not an exact science you know, so maybe, I say maybe, happiness is a little more important than excellence  as the French author, Michel de Montaigne, said once : ""a well-made rather than a well-filled head.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Worth Rewatching,"Matt Damon's breakthrough work. A masterpiece that's made possible by a good, simple, honest script, a bunch of high quality new faces and vintage actors, and a drive to tell meaningful story of real people.I watched this a second time recently, and picked up even more nuances that I missed years ago. Robin Williams played his 'therapist with unresolved past' part so perfectly. Great synergy between the young Damon and Williams.The under-estimated Minnie Drivers also made a supporting appearance here. Good chemistry between the love birds. Unforced, un-self-conscious naturalistic acting from actresses is so rare, a pleasure to watch.Evident in this movie, Ben Affleck is a genuinely modest human being who is really not conceited about his natural good looks or brain. I hope he take his return as writer-producer and actor-producer seriously. Hollywood can do with more progressive actor producers like him.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good Will Falling,"Falling flat is what this movie does, ever since the pretentious beginning: the attempt to capitalize on a presumed genius from the slums falls short of the target simply because while saying f*** every two words is true to life for more people than we want to know, a universal 'genius' as the one portrayed by Damon is nowhere to be seen, or conceived. The kind of 'knowledge' displayed by Damon is mostly fruit of dumb and trite photographic memory, and does not have the least to do with 'intelligence': as for the mathematical part it's pure fantasy, because Ramanujan may well have lived and impressed 100 years ago (mind me, he still impresses now), but would have a much harder time if he lived today. Speaking as a mathematician, it is shocking to see how carefully the movie tries to depict low life, and how easily it falls into the most stereotypical misconceptions about 'higher learning'. Overindulgence in realistic reproduction of a southie's foul language and scars, flanked by stale and flat portrayal of the MIT mathematics department may say it all: the script authors obviously share more with f*** than with f(x).",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Nice Drama that stretches out For Solutions!,"""Good Will Hunting"" is a decent drama movie that goes really deep into things and looks at situations and perspectives from different sides. The plot is settled in Boston, were a young, intelligent man called Will gets discovered by his amazing mathematical skills and tactics. He does some dirty work and gets arrested, but luckily a professor gives him a chance too help him and discover his potential, and of course, release him out of prison. The story focus a lot on Will's backstory and how he become the person he is today. Together with his trustworthy psychiatrist, they are going through multiple issues, and travels through Will's life and go further and further too understand everything. The deep message and moral comes brightly in, and the story is showing perfectly how it is to be isolated and lonely, even if it doesn't seems too look like it at first. Even though the amazing story development and convincing acting (Especially from Matt Demon and Robin Williams) I got to say that some points let the rating down a little lower. First of all, I wished it could be shorter. Maybe a half hour or so. The plot was interesting, but some moments felt pushed in and dragged in for no reason at all. Some character conversations that they had didn't felt so important compared too the rest of the movie, and that was what I felt a letdown. The second thing I have to pick on was less developed story from the outside. Will's story is of course the most important one, but they could take a peak on some other characters or have a little side story, just too spice up things. Or even look some more on the world outside and how it was, you know, something like that. Lastly I got to mention the technicals. Decent music, as well as nice pictures and ok camera filming. All these elements makes an enjoyable experience. To summarise, this drama was enjoyable, it's valuable with a great message and moral, convincing actors and nice technicals, but got some cons that definitely could be fixed. Overall a nice film too watch together with your family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Liked it, didn't love it","I'm not one of the people who said, ""Wow, this is the best movie I've ever seen!"", but I did like it a lot.  I think the reason I didn't love it is I thought the conflict between the Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard characters was somewhat exaggerated for dramatic purposes, and I didn't always buy it.  I did like the relationships between the other characters, especially between the Matt Damon and Ben Affleck characters.  My favorite moment in the movie is Affleck's speech to Damon where he tells him his favorite part of the day is when he thinks Damon isn't there.

From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

good script hunting?,I have never believed for a minute that Matt and Ben really wrote enough of this script to win an Oscar each. I get the feeling it really was the encouragement award not the Best Original Script award. I hope time proves me right and it is revealed that several other experienced ghost writers added the plot turns and the odd funny quip. I think it is primarily cursed with swearing and lazy characterization and it basically does not make sense. If Will is such a genius why can't he work out that behaving like a completely obnoxious idiot won't get him anywhere? etc...I agree with most of the criticisms on this site and place it gently in the bin for Movie Psychotherapy For American Audiences Who Need Movies To learn How To Behave.,3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"An Endearing, Relatable Story That Will Leave You Deeply Contemplative","The first time I watched Good Will Hunting as an adolescent, I absolutely hated it. Much like so many others in young Will's life, I just couldn't get over his immature exterior. But after gaining decades of real-world experience
and perhaps some emotional maturity of my own, I now can view the film for what it is: a masterclass in endearing, relatable storytelling.For a very basic overview, Good Will Hunting tells the story of its titular Will Hunting (Matt Damon). Will is a mathematical genius of savant proportions who catches the eye of an MIT math professor (Stellan Skarsgård) after solving a complex equation left on a blackboard. So, why is Will mopping MIT floors and doing construction jobs instead of working for prestige think tanks? Because Will is a troubled young man who lacks motivation and maturity in equal measure. As such, he is sent to therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) who tries a rather unorthodox approach to unlocking Will's unique potential--in mathematics and life.If I had to sum up Good Will Hunting's appeal in one word it would be: relatable. From the first time viewers are introduced to Will and his Boston-area buddies (Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, & Cole Hauser), their cocky rapport is instantly identifiable as ""New England"". Will's character journey is also one that every human being can contemplate--that of taking a risk or playing it safe in the game of life. In essence, writers Damon & Affleck play with themes here that transcend both time and place.Damon is certainly brilliant as the lead--it's no wonder he's built such a diverse acting career in subsequent years. But Williams almost hijacks the proceedings here as the therapist dealing with as many issues as his oft-petulant client. In the way that only Williams could, hilarious wise-crack humor is combined with deep emotional monologues and introspection. From his dramatic retelling of the ""gotta go see about a girl"" Red Sox 1975 Game 6 incident to the now-iconic ""it's not your fault"" treatise, Williams proves for the umpteenth time (if perhaps not yet at that point) he could be oh so much more than ""just a funnyman"".Overall, Good Will Hunting is the type of picture that captures lightning in a bottle: peak Robin Williams, young-and-hungry Damon & Affleck, and a story that stands the test of time. I now completely understand why it netted Oscar hardware for Williams, Affleck, & Damon--and maybe could have taken home the big award if not for Titanic's rule that year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A layered and lucid  film,"The film works because it manages to capture various shades of each character in an unforced manner through an intelligent script.Though the impossibility of the scenario depicted may make one apprehensive in the beginning,it is precisely that which allows the cast the unique opportunity to lend credibility to the film's script by their remarkably honest performances complemented by crackling dialogue which ranges from the witty,to the profound,to the meaningfully terse without being overly emphatic at any time.There are many things which have been handled with admirable sensitivity like the bond of friendship between the boys,how the healer(Sean)manages to reach out to Will who in turn makes an impact on him,the refreshing chemistry between Will and Skylar,how prof.Lambeau's personal fears,Will's troubled past and his vulnerability are brought out.Yet for all it's finer nuances,the story is told in such a simple and lucid manner that it holds one's attention even if one refuses to probe into them.I can go on and on about this layered film but i'd rather not because i would like the reader to watch this engaging film speak it's own language himself(or herself)and gather the joys of discovering it's subtleties.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
My All Time Favourite,"What can I say about this film? It features one of the greatest screenplays of the last 20 years, written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, full of thought-provoking dialogue and some beautiful monologues, (My personal favourite is from Ben Affleck at the construction site about 3/4 of the way through the film). All the actors are great. Matt Damon perfectly embodies the role that he plays, an immature, cocky yet gifted boy in a world which he believes will wait for and build around him. Robin Williams plays an empathetic, yet gloomy psychologist who has never fully gotten over the death of his wife. Even Ben Affleck-haters will acknowledge Affleck's good work here, as Will Hunting's seemingly bonehead friend, who, as the film goes on, is revealed to be caring, empathetic man. Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard round out the cast, all of whom give good performances. The plot is something many of us can relate to: An overconfident, intelligent man who cannot be bothered to realise his full potential. The insecurities of Will Hunting are fleshed out in great detail by the script, Damon's performance and Gus Van Sant's use of close ups for a lot of the major scenes, showing Hunting's emotions in detail. However, in some of the crowd scenes, such as in classrooms, Van Sant lacks a little imagination, resorting to the same camera pan sequence over and over again. Nevertheless, he is a more than capable director who delivers for the most part here. Danny Elfman's use of music adds to the heartwarming factor of the film. The film won two Oscars, Robin Williams winning Best Supporting Actor as well as Damon and Affleck winning Best Original Screenplay. In addition to this, Damon, Van Sant, Driver, Elfman and editor Pietro Scalia, earned nominations for their efforts. The film was also nominated for best original song and best picture. I would recommend this film to anyone, however, parents should be careful with letting their children watch this, as it contains a lot of coarse language as well as frequent sexual references. A superb work of modern drama.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

typical mainstream film product,"The only reason this movie got made, I suppose, is that Robin Williams found a role he liked and wanted to do. A few notes : (1). The type of ""genius"" that is portrayed here does not, to my knowledge, exist. Mathematics and the humanities emanate from two different areas in the brain, both of which are NEVER simultaneously developed to the extent indicated here. On top of that Will Hunting has what is apparently a photographic memory. AND he's very good-looking, *AND* he's a tough. Wow. This is really yet another dumbed-down Superhero movie in disguise.(2). Psychiatry is a highly complex and arcane field, as intellectually formidable as anyone could want. You can neither embrace it nor reject it wholesale. The pompous, self-deluded disdain shown by uneducated people for ""shrinks"" is here also shown by Will, thereby negating his supposed intellectual worthiness. Also, psychoanalytic theory ceased being at the forefront of psychotherapy decades ago. People who are still bashing Freud should really do a bit of reading.This falls into the category of 99% of films that are designed for passive viewing, and not to challenge or stimulate the viewer in any real sense. It all adds up to a big nothing ; just a bunch of oversweetened moments that will work for people who have no real mental life. The ""math"" here is little more than a set-prop with no real depth or detail (Disclaimer : I am an engineer). Will Hunting and his coterie of ""friends"" are really total dumbasses. The ""girlfriend"" is skin-crawlingly obnoxious, but then again men are desperate fools, so I guess he COULD endure her.The two kids who wrote this movie have never actually read a difficult book. Its a film made BY the uneducated, FOR the uneducated. If you liked this, you are a pseudo-intellectual.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
9.5,"I am torn between giving this movie a 9 or a 10.  I will not go into how good this movie is, because it has already been said many times.  But it is not quite a ""10"", because of a couple things.  Firstly, Minnie Driver's character seemed really unnecessary.  Why do they have to insert a romance into every movie?  It really ruins the plausibility of the movie - all of the other characters don't suddenly find their ""true loves"", why does the main character always have to?  It really didn't even have much of anything to do with the story.Also, the idea that you have to go to Harvard or even college to get a good job is highly overrated.  If this kid is such a genius, there are many jobs he could just walk into (and probably be happier doing).  There is a middle ground between being a janitor and a 6 figure salary.Otherwise it is definitely a must-see flick, almost a 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Nonetheless, a strong story, good acting, and excellent direction from Gus Van Sant make `Good Will Hunting' one of the best films of 1997.

Blue-Collar Boston's Diamond in the Rough,"This movie celebrates the unsung hero but beyond that, it challenges us to cast aside stereotypes and see the diamond in the rough. In that sense, it follows the Frank Capra tradition of exalting the forgotten people in our own midst.The main plot is about a young man named Will Hunting who works as a janitor at MIT but in his blue collar world, there is a genius lurking. The sub-plot involving two academic rivals – Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard – is about the struggle between two strong personalities to decide the best way to help Will.Will suffers from a background of being shuffled from one foster home to another and this leads to behavior that regularly lands him in trouble. He is discovered by a professor, Gerald Lambeau, played by Skarsgard, who himself has been honored for outstanding academic achievement. Lambeau seeks out his long-time rival, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to be the youth's therapist – a court-mandated requirement to get Will out of a possible prison sentence and to get him on track to achieve the tremendous success Lambeau feels he is capable of.The rivalry between the two professors takes on tremendous significance for Will's future. Lambeau sees potential waiting to be unleashed and Maguire sees the wounded human soul, who needs to be rescued before he releases him into the world.Will finds love in a young university woman named Skylar, played by Minnie Driver, who clearly sees the broken man with a big heart, who is a latent genius. Skylar is a natural with Will and his friends, despite the fact that they exist in different worlds. When Skylar decides to pursue her dreams in California, she asks Will to go with her. She loves him deeply but because of a deep-seated fear he might be hurt or betrayed, Will cannot bear to leave the world he knows with the friends he trusts. His friends are Chuck Sullivan, (Ben Affleck) Morgan O'Mally, (brother Casey Affleck) and Billy McBride (Cole Hauser).Will's fate is more or less decided at a critical moment in the movie with his therapist and is reinforced by his girlfriend Skylar and his friend Chuckie – both believe in him and care deeply for him. This movie is the result of collaboration between Damon and Affleck. They wrote and produced the movie, drawing on their Boston roots to show the hardscrabble existence of the blue-collar Irish in South Boston (Southie) with poverty and street fighting. The movie is directed by Gus Van Sant, who directed the movie Elephant. The foul language is somewhat jarring but serves to make the movie an accurate portrayal.This movie shows the gap between the blue-collar workers and the university people in the same city but in that setting two strong-willed men try to help a young man from the wrong side of town.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Almost lives up to the hype,"Despite some annoying flaws, I would still have to call this a great movie. I didn't at all mind that the film was a little far-fetched.  Instead, what bothered me was that the scenes that were supposed to be the most emotionally charged did nothing for me.  Considering how effective the movie usually was, it was very irritating to have a couple of scenes that didn't seem to work.  But it was still a great movie, thanks in large part to a generally solid script and terrific acting by everyone involved, especially Robin Williams, who should give up comedies entirely, since he's such a tremendous talent when given a dramatic part.

Aside from his jobs he regularly lands in trouble and generally burns through life with an attitude, to his best friend (Afleck)'s dismay. What his friend knows is that Will is brilliant, he has the mind of a prodigy.Will could do anything or be anyone he wants but feels most at home without responsibilities, it's the duty of his friends, his girlfriend (Minnie Driver) and a burned out psychologist (played exceptionally by Robin Williams) that have to 'kick him in the ass' so to speak.This film blew me away, and when I discovered later that Matt Damon and Ben Afleck wrote it I garnered an entire new respect for both.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Healthy Cynicism,"This movie makes a strong statement for individuality and stepping outside of the system. The brilliance of Damon's character (Will Hunting), lies not in his mathematical genius, but in his ability to assess social structures, schemes and systems. His cynicism is an effective shield against those who would use his talents for their own personal gain. Robin Williams' character is very believable as a therapist, because while he does not necessarily support Hunting becoming part of the corporate (or government) money machine, he does express the value in using one's abilities to one's utmost.the movie could have benefited from an exploration of Hunting's past (where he came from and what made him what he is), as well as some time spent in understanding what his inner thoughts and feelings are. Maybe the scene with Ben Affleck acting as Hunting's agent could have been scrapped, to fit in more character development for Hunting. Again, this movie makes an important statement about how the amoral, cookie-cutter world of business has affected us all and therefore, why some revile and avoid it.This is a warning to the society we have built: Integrate those who are dis-affected, and create a world of greater humanity or we will all suffer the loss of ourselves.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

An intelligent story,"This is a very intelligent film about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a young genius, who because of his disadvantaged and abusive childhood, ends up as a janitor at MIT when he could easily be the head of the Mathematics department.  Though the story is a bit far fetched (it is hard to believe a kid this bright wouldn't have been noticed by someone who would have guided him towards higher education), once you put that aside, it is a fascinating character study of a very complex and dynamic young man.Will is discovered after solving a math challenge left on a blackboard by the head of the math department at MIT.  This throws his life into turmoil, as the mathematicians want to make him into a prodigy.  He also begins seeing a therapist (Robin Williams) who forces him to confront many deep emotions and experiences he had been repressing.  The effect this has on him, and his relationship with his friends is powerful and makes for an engrossing tale.The screenplay was written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for which they won an academy award (the film was nominated for nine).  Both were considered promising young actors before this film, but this tied a rocket pack to their backs and lit the fuse.  Damon was outstanding in the lead.  He had a very complex character to play and his emotional range was phenomenal.  Not only was he quick witted, charming and vibrant, but he also had to be hot headed, arrogant, confused and despondent.  He was able to switch emotions with ease and was always intense and believable.  Robin Williams also gave one of his better performances and received a best supporting Oscar.It is hard not to like this film.  Most of the challenges that Will faced were inside him, and watching him struggle to overcome the limitations from his past was very uplifting.  I rated this film a 9/10.

Will then gets sent to jail because of assaulting a police officer. The math teacher, named Gerald Lambeau, convinces the judge to let him out on two conditions. One, he must report to Gerald every week to work on more advanced mathematical proofs, and two Will must meet with a psychiatrist every week named Sean Macguire(Robin Williams)as well. Will meets a girl named Skylar and soon form a relationship. With Gerald, Sean, and Skylar Will might learn to believe in himself.

A Wonderful Film!,"The first time I saw this film I liked it, but I didn't realize how good it was.  After a few more viewings I came to understand how great this film truly is.  The story is very interesting and quite entertaining.  The cast is excellent and the acting is very good.  The comedy is very well done and well placed throughout the film.  The only complaint I have about the film is the absurd amount of swearing in the film.  I agree that sometimes it is necessary, but there is a truly unnecessary amount of language in the film. But please, don't let that discourage you from seeing the film, it is a very good film.As I said above, the cast is excellent.  Matt Damon pulls off one of his best performances so far in his career.  Robin Williams does a fantastic job in this film and definitely deserved his Oscar!  Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser, and Stellan Skarsgard were all excellent supporting cast members!I would definitely recommend this film, as long as you can deal with the swearing.  If you do end up seeing the film, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Not bad...,"In general, this movie is very good.  Boston (and Cambridge) are faithfully rendered; this movie brings across the feel of these places very well. The acting was pretty good, and the dialogue was great.  I only have one complaint about this movie, and it's a big one: this movie is very predictable.  I don't think there was a single plot point that didn't telegraph itself a good half hour ahead of time.  The plot has as many twists and turns as the highway between Fort Worth and Dallas.  But if you don't mind predictability, you'll probably like this movie a lot.Kudos on a minor point.  Being a kind of amateur linguist, and a native of Boston's northern suburbs, I've often noticed how badly movies and television shows misrepresent the distinctive Boston accent.  Well, this movie got it right for the most part.  My compliments to the dialect coach. (Robert Easton didn't have anything to do with this, did he?)",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An injection of motivation and spine-tingling inspiration.,"It didn't have bombs.  It didn't have comets.  And it didn't have a gigantic, sinking boat.  Bottom line?  Didn't need it.  In this inspiring, fantasy-wrought screenplay brought to life, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon prove that a down-to-earth, low-budget film can capture magnificence without all the special effects and larger than life cinematography.  With Gus Van Sant, the envisioner of the movie, and the unsurprisingly superb Danny Elfman behind the musical wheel, Good Will Hunting deserved the Oscar for Best Picture.  Titanic was predictable and true; Good Will Hunting offered a new story to the genre of fantasy screenplays, and it was evident in its winning Best Original Screenplay.  As deserving as this was, the Academy fell far short of a consolation prize when it denied it Best Picture.  See this movie and follow along with Will on his magical ""hunt"" for a future and security.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Well made and well acted, but ultimately not my cup of tea.","Let's face it: I hated mathematics at school and still do today, so the film didn't appeal to me in that sense, but it appealed to me in respect of life's lessons. I also enjoyed the film due to Robin Williams, whom I just love as an actor. This was a very dramatic and emotional role for him, which he did brilliantly. Matt Damon was also very good and believable as the young rebel. Ben Affleck's character was unnecessary and mostly silly and I found he ruined the scenes where he was present (although the character does give the best advise towards the end). Minnie Driver was also excellent as the love interest Skylar. She really gave a powerful performance.As expected, although interesting, the film became dreary to a point where I couldn't wait for the credits to roll. Due to the film's long running time, the events in the film didn't capture my attention enough to satisfy my movie experience needs. It did have a satisfying ending, though, as both Will Hunting and the psychologist (Robin Williams) gained from their sessions.'Good Will Hunting' is regarded as one of the top rated films of all time (and, yes, I can understand why), and won numerous awards including two Oscars.This is a film I'll probably never watch again, regardless of how well made and well acclaimed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Fantastic portrayal of life's outsiders,"Good Will Hunting is fantastic! A story written by Matt Damon and Ben Afleck which is a little mastermind that leaves you with a large smile at the end, after the emotional roller-coaster throughout. Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a mathematical genius and has potential that only one wishes to have, however there is real personal issues that has affected Will, stopping his own potential to be full-filled because of his life experiences growing up as a child. In more specific terms Will is like a terrified child who stays at home on his couch, so he doesn't have to go into the real world and feel the kind of hurt that has affected him before in life. Will hangs around with so called ""no brainers"" and his best friend Chuckie (Played by Ben Afleck) who is the type that really would lie in the middle of the road for Will we gradually begin to admire this genuine loyal friendship that in the middle class world seems to be rare for some people. Great sub-plot with therapist Sean Maguire (played by Robin Williams) which is like cat and mouse with each meetings they have. Will has always called the shots and kept in control of what he wants people to no and understand about him, but Sean is finally his match, and with great dialogue this kept me locked and fascinated throughout the film as i generally wanted to no more about Will and understand him! There is love in Will's life called Skylar (played by Minne Driver) and Skylar has everything charisma, looks, intelligence and a very sweet/caring side. Will struggles throughout being able to allow himself to love Skylar and become vulnerable for a women once in his life. Good Will hunting is a film that educates and provokes human ignorance for roughly 2 hours and definitely changes people perceptions of judging people who they truly don't understand!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Awesome Film,This film is one of my all time favorites.  Although I am not a big fan of either Damon or Affleck I still have to say they wrote a great film.  This is movie I could watch over and over again. The language in it is horrible but I look past that.  I think that this film should be seen by almost everyone.  Check this film out as soon as you get a chance.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Every time I see it, I love it more","I remember watching this when it first came out on video. My uncle said he wasn't sure if I should watch it due to the excessive amount of bad language. But my Mom told him it was alright (my fav. movie is Pulp Fiction, I think I cand handle this). So I watched it and loved it.A couple months later Blockbuster had it on sale for two dollars, so I bought it. I watched it again and loved it even more than the first time. So it seems everytime I watch it I love it more than the last time.For one, the acting. Matt Dillon and Ben Affleck were very good and seemed very comfortable with the roles they were in. Robin Williams deserved his Oscar, it is always nice to see him doing something heartfelt, showing that he is a true actor, not just a clown. Minnie Driver was very good also. All of the roles seemed well written. The writing of the film is perfection. It allows us tp feel sorry for someone who could seem very unforgiving for all the pain he brings people. Also, it allows us  to see both sides of the story. I sympathized with Will, I think if he didn't want to ""Explain things to people my whole life"" then that is what he wants and should be aloud to do what  he wants. I also understood where the professor was coming from, he just didn't want to see Will throw his life away.It is a very good film and I recomend it to all. 9.5/10",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Overuse of F-Word Kills A Good Film,"There are some excellent moments in Good Will Hunting. Matt Damon, the genius, conceited, janitor working nights at MIT, doing the bars, and eying the women with his (real life) buddy and best friend Ben Affleck along with the Psychiatrist, Robin Williams, who tries to keep Damon out of jail and on the straight and narrow path.It's a very good coming of age character study, mixed in with some powerful scenic changes and moods. Director Gus Van Sant creates a genuine feeling for the characters and their situations so that you can (almost) feel empathy for Will Hunting and his troubled past. BUT...The film's tender moments are ruined to the point of destruction with the F-bomb coming out of Damon's mouth at every other breath. This approach seems to be more for shock value, and it is overdone so much that friends of mine who had seen this movie thought it was overkill as well. A couple of relatives walked out of the theater because the language became so bad it was like, ""OK, when is it going to stop?"" The movie becomes a chore, a task to sit through when it shouldn't be because of the non-stop profanity. Many will think Damon doesn't need therapeutic guidance, but his mouth washed out with soap instead.This is a movie where I actually like the censored TV print better! Without the F-bombs, the story is so much better and delivers a richer meaning than leaving them in.The bad language really hurts what could have been a GREAT movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Best Movie not in the IMDb Top 250- one of the best ever made,"If you've seen the movie Paycheck, you would not assume that Ben Affleck has brilliant writing talent in him. He apparently does and, along with childhood pal Matt Damon, in Good Will Hunting, he has penned a nearly perfect script. Good Will Hunting will make you laugh and make you cry. It will make you angry and sad and happy and excited all at once. It makes you root for its protagonist one moment and then hate him for being so stubborn the next. In short, it is one of the most powerful screenplays ever written.Besides the writing, it is also perfectly acted. Ben Affleck is fantastic as Will Hunting's best friend and deserved an Oscar nomination simply for the scene in which he tells Will that he wishes Will would one day simply not be at his house. While Affleck is great in a relatively small role, however, it is Damon and Robin Williams who steal the show as the titular character and his psychologist, respectively. Damon's Will Hunting is just about the smartest man in the world, a man who can solve the most difficult calculus problem in his head and can read a book in a matter of minutes. Despite his genius, he is deeply emotionally troubled, due to his upbringing on the rough streets of Boston. Williams won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant portrayal of the only man who was able to get under Will's skin.The movie, as stated above, makes you feel a wide span of emotions. Will is such a complex character that we cannot ever fully understand what makes him tick. Sometimes, we feel like he is growing emotionally, and sometimes we just can't grasp why he is being so stubborn and immature. The movie flows beautifully from one scene to the next and only seems to get better as it progresses. Also, it stands up wonderfully upon multiple viewings.Good Will Hunting was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1997 but only came away with two wins, Robin Williams for Best Supporting Actor and Damon and Affleck for Best Original Screenplay. I have seen all five films nominated for Best Picture that year, and this film is far and away the best of them. Titanic is a very good movie and certainly groundbreaking in terms of visual effects, but it comes nowhere close to making the emotional impact that this film makes. Also, Matt Damon was absolutely robbed of an Oscar for Best Actor by Jack Nicholson (As Good as it Gets).Simply put, Good Will Hunting is one of the best films of the 1990's and one of my personal favorites of all time. I have handed out only 20 ratings of perfect 10's on IMDb out of over 600 films that I've rated. Good Will Hunting earned this coveted rating by combining a phenomenal screenplay with superb direction and impeccable acting. This film is truly one not to miss.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Over-rated,"This is undeniably a character-driven film, and I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more if the eponymous character was a little more realistic. Matt Damon clearly knew he would be playing Will Hunting- he and co-writer Ben Affleck crafted a self-indulgent character that actors dream about. First of all, he's great looking.  Secondly, he's wild and rebellious. Thirdly- and best of all- he's a genius!  Any flaws in the character are created only to give Damon opportunity to display himself as an actor. Robin Williams is totally uninteresting- how'd he get an Oscar?  And Minnie Driver- why is this woman an actress?  Had this movie been written by someone with any sense of character, it could have been great; as it stands, it's barely good.

A film generating polemic,"I've seen the movie for the first time a few weeks ago. Curious about other people's opinion, I took a look on film's comments. Some people gave this film a very low rating. It's obvious why. If those people know the life from watching movies and TV shows, this movie means nothing. But if you go out there, living between real people on a daily basis, you realise the qualities of this film. Comparing it with another Hollywood movie, this film is crap. Comparing it with the real life, it is unbelievable true and exciting. If we analyse the qualities of a film by the amount of truth brought in from our day-by-day life, of course, if we really want to see life and not only ourselves every single moment, we realise how mach frustration can be hidden in an individual.For those underrating the movie: you might very well be surrounded by trees, without knowing you're actually in a forest.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Brilliant movie,"Let me start with the profanity: it is SO true to Boston, particularly South Boston (known as ""Southie""). (Southie is a particularly idiosyncratic neighborhood, as you can see from the way its inhabitants are portrayed.) The accents (even Robin Williams') rang true to this ex-Bostonian, and the dialogue was spot on. The script was perfect. And the performances were uniformly top-notch: Robin Williams was so believable as the educated psychiatrist who still hadn't left behind his Southie roots. He's never been better, before or since, which is a credit to Gus Van Sant.I've been to MIT and Harvard, I've been to Southie, and I've lived in Boston.

Fantastic and Engaging- A Must,"First word for this film is powerful, but that alone is not enough to describe the feelings i have after watching it.Good Will Hunting is fantastic in almost every way, its writing is fantastic with amazing dialogue and well fleshed out characters who you really care about. The acting is fantastic from every actor involved, I know Ben Affleck gets lots of stick but he's great also, but special praise goes to Matt Damon who portrays the troubled young man to perfection and Robin Williams, who shows what a great actor he can be in the right role, who is the grown up version of Matt Damon who never fully utilized his potential. These are ably supported by the likes of Minnie Driver and Stellen Skarsgard who also put in great supporting roles.As i said earlier the one thing that stays with you after watching it is the power of the film, this is from the performances and from the story itself.

"From the South of Boston, where do you go? Out west maybe?","This is still a favorite of ours for 20+ years now, our most recent viewing was last night on my DVD copy of the movie. We have probably watched it 5 or 6 times over the years.This of course won the Oscar for Damon's and Affleck's script, which itself originated from a paper Damon wrote while in college. Quite an unlikely development for two 20-something friends but in watching the movie yet again I am struck with how well several meaningful themes are woven in the script.The main theme is Damon's character, Will Hunting, who has a brilliant mind but as an orphan was abused in his foster home, resulting in his building a mostly impenetrable shell around himself. Some of the best scenes are with him and his psychologist Sean, played by Robin Williams.And Ben Affleck, Damon's best friend in real life, is Will's best friend Chuckie who doesn't have a brilliant mind and accepts that he will be a laborer all his life. He would feel insulted if Will ended up wasting his gift.All this comes to a head when Will meets Skyler who will soon be graduating from college and heading out west for medical school. She and Will fall in love but Will is scared to commit himself to a relationship. In the end he has to decide if he will just stay in Boston.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A lot has been said about Good Will Hunting. Everything from movie of the year, to a yawner. I would put it somewhere in the middle.","Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a young man from Boston who is brilliant, but also a troublemaker. He has a gift, something that he could use to get out of the down-trodden life he lives, but he's afraid, of his gift, and of leaving what he knows. But when as part of his probation for assaulting a police officer, he is released into the care of an M.I.T. professor, he has to face his fears face on. This is done with his psychologist, played by Robin Williams. For me, the movie came alive when Williams showed up. Up until that point, it was well done, but basic. Williams has the ability in his movies to either totally take control of a scene, or to sit back and play off the other actors (I can't wait for Insomnia.)  I know he's generally seen as a comedic actor, but he's one of the few that can also pull of a serious role (again, I can't wait for Insomnia.)  After he meets Will, he sort of meets his match. After losing his wife to cancer, he went into his own shell, staying with what he knew, what was safe. But while he teaches Will to meet his fears head on, Will also teaches him a few things.Once again, the plot is somewhat predictable. When Williams' character says early on that he skipped Game 6 of the World Series because he had to see about a woman, you knew that line would come back later on, and it did. The thing that makes this movie worthwhile, was the performance of Williams. I know everyone is talking about Matt Damon being the next big thing, and the script he and friend and co-star Ben Affleck wrote, is strong. But the person that carries the film, in my mind, is Robin Williams. And having Minnie Driver in the movie doesn't hurt (my bias for beautiful women comes through again). So even though you can guess what's going to happen next, the dialogue between the characters (and they all do a good job of holding on the Boston accent the entire film), and the superior acting carry the movie a long way. Not a yawner, not movie of the year, but fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good film,"Minnie Driver was an interesting, non-classical beauty choice for Will's love interest and was played well. But Damon as Will Hunting and Affleck were just grating. First of all, I find it completely annoying when characters are constantly lighting up cigarettes and smoking. Yuck. Other than that, Will Hunting's toothy smarmy smiling was just, ugh. I suppose if you find Matt Damon handsome, maybe that would be considered attractive somehow, the big toothy grin but for me, it was just another smarmy aspect to the character of Will. I don't understand the title of the film, what does it really explain about the character of Will ? Was he supposed to be a good guy ? He seemed like an arrogant jerk to me. And even though Sean the therapist finally gets through to Will via a carefully built up friendship and a scene culminating in ""it's not your fault"" that makes Will break down and cry...it seemed to me to be rather quickly resolved trauma in one short scene. Like maybe writers Ben Affleck and Matt Damon realized the story ran too long (it did) and it was time to wrap it up already with some kind of neat resolution.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"F***, Will Hunting (the character) isn't that f***ing good","I don't usually talk like that; I'm just poking fun at the characters in the film. If you find that blurb offensive you'd better skip this movie.""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) tells the story of a young genius, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who comes from a tough neighborhood in South Boston and works as a janitor at MIT. A Math professor, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård), posts a difficult problem on the board and is amazed to discover that Will solves it. Will gets in trouble with the law but Lambeau gives succor and enlists the help of psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to get him on the right path. Meanwhile Will is falling for a Harvard girl (Minnie Driver).The plot of a genius janitor is great and I thought I'd like the film more than I did, but a couple of things really bog it down.For one, Will Hunting is not a ""good"" person, as the title suggests (I'm sure they were being ironic). In fact, he's so smart he's stupid. Doesn't he know that smoking will destroy his body and send him to an early grave? But that's the least of Will's shortcomings. He's arrogant and unnecessarily mean. For instance, Professor Lambeau visits him in jail and Will's first words are, ""What the f*** do you want?"" Could anyone be that stupid? How about, ""Hi, I'm Will. Who are you, Sir?"" I get it -- he's from a tough neighborhood and was abused as a kid, but 99% of guys from tough neighborhoods who were abused as kids don't talk unnecessary sheet like Will does in this film.In fact, too much of the cussing rings untrue. Will and his three friends from South Boston (including Ben Affleck) use the f-word practically every other word and it strikes an inauthentic chord. Yes, I get it -- they're trying to act like hooligans from a rough neighborhood -- but they try too hard and it comes off contrived.I should add that I hail from a hooligan-oriented neighborhood where the gang cussed, drank & smoked like sailors, but even we could construe eight words together without throwing in the f-word. I have no problem with realistic cussing in films; in fact, I prefer it. But when it's so over-the-top that it seems artificial it detracts from the drama.Furthermore, Damon doesn't LOOK like a tough guy from the wrong side of the tracks (neither does Ben, but he's a little better). Matt's miscast because he just looks too soft with his baby-face. I think he knew this because he tries too hard to be a tough punk, and it shows.The fact that the main protagonist is thoroughly unlikable takes away from the story. Who cares about some disrespectful punk who doesn't care to better himself, genius or not? As a result, the drama isn't nearly as compelling as it could've been. When Sean (Williams) finally gets Will to break at the end, I wasn't much interested.Still, if you can handle the trying-too-hard-to-appear-tough acting and dialog, ""Good Will Hunting"" is worth catching if you like dramas. For one, Robin Williams is great in an atypical role as a serious psycho-therapist who is able to handle Will and overcome his (genius) defense mechanisms. Skarsgård is also excellent. And please don't take my criticisms the wrong way because there IS some good drama in this film, but it's buried underneath contrived writing and the corresponding performances (mainly Matt and Ben).Incidentally, Minnie and Matt hooked up after this movie, so the romantic sparks are real.The film runs 126 minutes and was shot on location in Massachusetts and Toronto.GRADE: C+",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Instead of breaking my head in figuring out the best way to describe what the movie (which is now in my all-time favorite movie list)is about, I will tell you what it's not.

In fact there is a sense of honesty in every character you see in the movie, the lines they speak and even their attitude throughout... and that is the charm of it.

To challenge them, he puts an impossible problem on the board with the promise that whoever solves it will win the prestigious Fields Medal of which he, himself, is a recipient.When the problem is solved within a week by an anonymous genius, the student body is baffled, and Lambeau sets out to find the elusive prodigy.He erupts into Will's life just as the latter is about to be sent to prison on an assault charge, and convinces the judge to release the boy into his custody with the condition that he see a therapist.Will is against the idea, and treats his first five therapists with utter contempt (providing some of the funniest scenes in the movie).In desperation, Lambeau turns to Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) a former roommate with whom he has never gotten along.With some effort, Lambeau finally coaxes Sean into seeing his new protégé.Sean, a widower who has never gotten over the loss of his wife, finds this new patient to be a challenge, while Will realizes he can't play his silly games with this particular therapist, and either has to fish or cut bait.Adding tremendously to the movie is the presence of Skylar (Minnie Driver) who almost immediately falls in love with Will, and is crestfallen by his inability to admit his own feelings.Back when the Oscars used to mean something, this movie was nominated for nine Academy Awards, and received two of them which it deserved completely.This is a movie that has depth, and meaning.
There isn't anything that could be added or changed.It's a perfect little jewel.

A timeless movie that I can watch over and over again,This is one of those movies that whenever I see it on the guide I have to watch it. Robin Williams and Matt Damon are magic together on the screen and it makes me wish that they had collaborated on more films. Good Will Hunting has stood the test of time and I truly believe this movie is a MUST SEE for everyone.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good Will Hunting - Movie Review,"Good Will Hunting is directed by Gus Van Sant and stars Robin Williams and Matt Damon.Will Hunting is a janitor at M. I. T., who has a gift for mathematics, but needs help from a psychologist to find direction in his life.This movie is amazing. I love this movie so much. Everybody is brilliant in the movie. I love Matt Damon in this movie as Will. Robin Williams is great in this movie. Ben Affleck is also in this movie and he is great as well. The scene where the psychologist played by Robin Williams tells Will it is not his fault and starts getting upset is very sad. I just love this movie so much. One of the best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the most beautiful and heart-touching movies I've ever watched,"Good Will Hunting is honestly one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Although Will Hunting's genius is completely unrealistic, and the plot was somewhat predictable, I'd still give it ten out of ten stars every single time. The characters were so beautifully written, with each their own demons and personalities. You could relate to almost all of them, so unbearably realistic. They captured the darkness but also the beauty of the human race with perfection and I am still in awe. The showed the contradictions, the pains, and the struggles we all go through as an individual. I haven't seen characters with this much depth or personality in a long time. The dialogue was natural and realistic, and the script was even better, heart touching at times. The plot was excellent and the story telling was wonderfully done, told with a certain vulnerability I have not seen in a long time. I cried and I laughed, and the ending was both sad and happy, a strange combination. Good Will Hunting is a tragically beautiful movie that captures the human's essence perfectly, that will leave you in shock once the credits are over and leave you thinking about it for days. I definitely recommend Good Will Hunting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Overhyped Drama,"Good Will Hunting is a film that has garnered widespread acclaim, but I find it to be somewhat overrated despite its notable strengths. Matt Damon delivers a compelling performance as Will Hunting, showcasing his talent with a raw, emotional portrayal that is undeniably impressive. Robin Williams also stands out with his heartfelt role as Sean Maguire. His performance brings warmth and wisdom to the film, providing a solid counterbalance to Damon's intense portrayal. The chemistry between the two actors creates some of the film's most engaging moments, making their scenes together genuinely impactful.However, the titular character, Will Hunting, can be quite irritating. His incessant self-destructive behavior and abrasive attitude, while intended to show his inner turmoil, often come off as grating rather than endearing. The constant focus on his rebellious nature becomes tiresome, overshadowing the film's more positive elements. Additionally, the film's narrative, though emotionally charged, feels formulaic. The story follows a familiar trajectory of overcoming personal obstacles, which, while powerful, doesn't offer much in terms of originality. The pacing can also drag, with some scenes feeling unnecessarily drawn-out.In summary, while Good Will Hunting boasts strong performances from its lead actors and offers an emotionally charged narrative, it falls short in its execution. The irritating nature of the central character and the film's conventional storytelling contribute to a sense of overhype that doesn't fully live up to the praise it has received.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good Will Hunting: Movie review,"'Good Will Hunting' is a drama that earned $225 million, whereas the budget of the movie is $10 million. It was directed by Gus Van Sant in 1997.The movie is about a twenty-year-old genius and the influence of his difficult childhood on his life.The high-level acting and well-written script attract moviegoers all over the world. The script was written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. 'Good Will Hunting' won two Academy Awards: the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.Written by Anastasiia Shystovska",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
no hope for Hollywood,"Good Will Hunting could have been an average movie, but it's nothing more than a ($%#)... bad movie. there is nothing you can relate to, it is full of cliche's ... Mat Damon is an awful actor (may be acceptable in some C-production 'hi-school-reunion-kids-got-drunk-movie'). screenplay... well he had an idea... initially - when he was (they were) around page 2 or 3 of the script... and than he took a $4.95 or so 'Screenplay for dummies'... if he didn't do that - this may be almost average movie. this way it is AWFULL and overrated... Robin Williams... Robin... oh the guy who acts 'dead poet's society' each time he sees the camera? even if it is the camera in the K-Marts.... don't mention it",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A touching and great drama written and played by two young and talented young stars!!,"Will Hunting is a rebellious and resentful adolescent, who likes to always be in his friends' company, drinking beer, beating Harvard's boys and knowing girls. What makes Hunting different from the other youths of his age, besides the money and his behavior's problems,is that the boy is owner of a brilliant intelligence, what makes him capable to solve difficult and challenging mathematical problems, to decorate parts of books and many other things.He reads Marx, Pope, Kant and many other famous authors. Will doesn't know how to guide his capability in a productive way, but after a mathematics teacher discovers the boy's potential, he decides to take him to Sean McGuire( Robin Willians,  who wrongly robbed Burt Reynolds' statue in the Oscar night), a hard, intelligent but sensitive psychologist, who has just lost his wife. The two end up building a true friendship, based on trust, and Will will have to evaluate his life and  choose among continuing to go on with his simple life or to open himself for the brilliant future that waits for him... Matt Damon, a young actor, wrote this excellent drama's plot,together with his friend Ben Affleck. In the hands of director Gus Van Sant, ""Good Will Hunting"" stayed faithful to the original ideas of the young stars, and it consecrated them as two great promises,due to their latent talent and charisma. Robin Willians gives a contained and thrilling interpretation ,building with effectiveness  a psychologist full of sorrow who, slowly, rediscovers the pleasure that life offers for those who want to get it. Actress Minnie Driver is excellent, portraying the girl who falls in love with Will and tries to make the boy surrender to the love! Gus Van Sant tried to avoid the exaggerations that marked his previous films, and he conducted with professionalism and talent a great film that teaches us something:for more difficult than life sometimes is is, if we count with values such as friendship, love, trust and pardon, is still possible to ennoble the world. Reaching the adolescent and adult public, ""Good Will Hunting"" is a thankful surprise!!watch the film, you will like it!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A beautiful movie with its flaws,"Everyone has heard about this movie, especially people from Academia. This was one of the first, well-made, and popular portrayals of the life of a mathematician. It nicely portrays how genius is delicate, and requires tender affection in order to be nurtured. The contrast between the callous mathematician and the emotional psychologist displays a theme that is relevant even today. However, this movie comes with its flaws. The love story seems a bit forced, and the lover of the main character seems one dimensional. However, Robin Williams and Matt Damon are phenomenal in their respective roles, uttering lines that will be remembered by generations to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
By far one of my top 5 movies to date!!!,This movie is in my top 5 possibly even top 3 because one people can relate to the story. Two the acting is initiated well. good flow maybe a little bit slow in the beginning but totally worth watching through! I hands down recommend this movie :),10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Best,"The Good:
I love how every character had an affect on one another. Sean taught Will how to be vulnerable, and how not to be scared to reach out and risk something every once and a while. Sean realizes that he needs to continue to move forward in his life, even though he thinks the best years are in the past, he can still go out and try to find more happiness.I love the type of personality that the main characters bring to the script. They are quick and interesting while still seeming realistic and flawed. Obviously, these flaws are the main premise and a big reason that I keep coming back.The ending nicely suggests the future for both Sean and Will without feeling like it needs to continue to be elaborated on or made longer.The Bad:
Will's intentions when he met with Sean seemed slightly different than when he met with the other therapists. The first few seemed like he just didn't care and was making jokes, but when he met with Sean it felt like his goal was to attack his morals and ideals.Will is way too wicked smart. The story wouldn't be possible without this though.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
How do you like them apples?,"I really enjoy watching this film, and it is one of the very few films that I think I could get to the end of it and actually stand to go straight back to the beginning and watch it all over again.Whether it is intentional or not, this film runs far deeper than it appears to. The fact that Will (Matt Damon) is a brilliant mathematician and incredibly intelligent is not what is important, and for me it is not the drive of the film. Too many people pick at the plot holes concerning Will's ""gifts"" and it spoils their interpretations of the film. Will's genius is simply an intriguing aspect that provides foundations for what I think is more complexity.What this film does is embrace the fact that there is nothing more important in life than other people. Will represents a safe path, a life that so many of us choose to live because we feel comfortable. Sean (Robin Williams) and Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) represent two paths out of safety and into something that is ultimately more worthwhile. Sean encourages a life encompassed by love, intimacy and experience, while Lambeau represents a life immersed entirely in intellectual achievement and the social high ground. One of these paths is, while incredibly gratifying, essentially empty, whereas the other is entirely fulfilling.This film helps us understand that we can't learn everything about life from books. Life is about the precious little experiences that are personal to us, that really matter, that touch our hearts or make us think. It is about experiencing the little imperfections in people that make them beautiful only to you. And throughout life, it is important that we follow our hearts and do what we truly want to do, and not what society expects of us.Ultimately, like so many films, Good Will Hunting is about love. But it conveys the emotion in ways that are more subtle, and beyond the boundaries of oozy sentimentality that few films bother to cross.How do I like them apples? I like them a lot.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The most beautiful film,"""Will Hunting"" deserves an unqualified 10/10. This film is a perfect work, from start to finish, and remains the most magnificent I have had the privilege of seeing in my entire life. While it may not be my favorite or the best, it embodies pure beauty. Its poignant story follows a young man from poverty, marked by abuse and abandonment, whose only precious legacy is his intelligence. Matt Damon delivers an exceptional performance. Each character is brilliantly interpreted, starting with Damon himself as a withdrawn genius, afraid of love and attachment, but finding refuge in friendship. Stellan Skarsgård deftly plays the jealous professor, but sincerely wishes for Will's success, while Robin Williams, as the psychologist, gives a moving performance as he seeks to guide Will toward self-understanding. Minnie Driver brings emotional depth as Will's girlfriend, navigating between jealousy and unconditional love. Will's friends, played by Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser, embody genuine camaraderie and unwavering support for his aspirations. This film captures the human spirit in all its complexity and beauty. With each viewing, the emotion is palpable, and each character, impeccably written, aspires to a single goal: to see Will succeed in life. Will Hunting is a true cinematic marvel that leaves an indelible mark on the hearts of its spectators.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Horrible!,"The fact that this film was nominated for Best Picture makes me sick to my stomach. The fact that this film was nominated for anything makes me sick. Every award this film was nominated for should have been a nomination for The Ice Storm instead. The Ice Strom was interesting and touching on so many levels and it was filled with brilliant performances. This film interested me in only one way; why the hell did so many people like it?At the end of this film we are supposed to think that Will has learned something. Well I hate to break it  you, but he's still an arrogant jerk. And Robin Williams, give me a break. The only good performance in this horrible movie was given by Stellan Skarsgard. Also, how can can script comprised of mostly the F-word win an Oscar?",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Your average day reality-hits-you movie, except better...","I kept rewinding the part in the credits where it said that the movie was written by Ben Affleck. And then I kept looking at the DVD box that said that he won an award for it as well. Never really liked him as an actor, but I guess he has some strength in writing.So the film is about a young adult named Will Hunting. We see that he lives alone in a small house because his parents abandoned him, works as a janitor at MIT, and spends most of his nights with his friends at bars. But what we also learn in this movie is that Will Hunting is a genius; he has incredible strengths in the fields of not only mathematics, but in all other subjects as well. And when a professor finds out that it was Will Hunting that solved the two Algebraic graph theory problems that was supposed to be solve by a student, rather than a janitor right outside his hallway, the professor goes out to help Will. Under the professor's supervision, Will must educate himself more with Algebraic graph theory class with the professor and sees a therapist two times each week.The rest is just about him trying to find himself. This movie is great and nobody can doubt it. I mean, the message that the movie brings really entertains me because sometimes we can not judge others for just how they may act everyday. It also shows how there are many individuals out there in the world that may have really high IQs, but do not know how to apply it to daily life. And that is what Will Hunting exactly is.Now I have seen Robin Williams a lot in stand up comedy and he was really funny. And there were some parts in the movie that Robin Williams was funny. But I am telling you, the Juilliard studying really came out in this movie. He was persuasive with the character he was playing and had parts where he had to keep expression that many actors struggle to have. And those actors are not even comedians like Robin Williams. Matt Damon also acted well going from charismatic joking to deep depressing attitudes. However, I really did not care for Affleck or Driver's acting. It was alright. The thing was that once you saw Damon and Williams act, those two were okay.The only problem I had with this movie (and if it were not for this problem, I would be giving this film somewhere in the eight range), was that there was unneeded raunchy dialogue and cursing during the back and forth discussions with Will Hunting and his little entourage. I get it that the movie takes place in South Boston, a ghetto if you may say. But still, really? Cursing to make a movie sound good? I mean, I have seen movies where cursing is used a lot more than this film, but there were scenes in this film where you really wanted them to be poignant and because one of the character said the f-word in an incorrect spot during the dialogue, it ruins it. This goes for Damon, Affleck, Williams, and Driver.But this movie really tied up things great in the end. Everything that may have been confusing all comes down well in the end and you get a piece of reality once you finished this movie. I was going to give this movie a low seven as I watched it, but only when you finish this movie, I will have to give it now a high 7. Usually highly-recommended films would be eight or higher, but I say that this would be a nice movie to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Average,Mediocre and predictable.  A few well written scenes but otherwise hackneyed.  Robin Williams performance is very strong; stronger than the rest of the cast. The main letdown is the plot's predictablity.  A fair first effort but not worthy of the praise heaped upon it.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Discovery of neglected young genius proves true piece of work!,"The story here is simple: A neglected 20 something ghetto kid anonymously solves the ""unsolvable"" calculus problem at the university campus where he works as a janitor, then is hounded by intellectual scholars who want to furhter this untapped genius mind. One problem: The kid is a little eccentric, bordering on the severely disturbed, and only one ""shrink"" is getting thru to him. Add a little love story and a happy ending an you've got ""Good Will Hunting"". Half-way-through you get a delicious scene, where the hero cuts down a ""bully"" in the student cafeteria by going brain-explosion-verbally-ballistic on him!

Outstanding Film,"This is a remarkable film for all viewers to watch. The crew did a tremendous in creating this film. The storyline of the film was really strong and powerful. There were some parts that could have been created differently but it was fine. The cast selection
was sensational. They fully committed and connected to the storyline and to their respective characters. This film reveals to viewers that there is more to life than meets the eye. This film teaches multiple things. Everyone has the freedom to do whatever they want to do in life. Unfortunately, I do not have that freedom. In my lifetime, everyone who is in life has restricted me from doing anything that I want to do in my life. This is a splendid film for everyone to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Good quality, intelligent drama - isn't that enough?","I can't really understand some of the adverse comment on this film; it may not be the best ever, but it's way above average. Basically, GWH is a classic (old-fashioned, if you like) character-driven drama, based on an improbable (and therefore interesting) but by no means impossible plot. It is to be welcomed as one of a seeming minority of Hollywood films, not centred on crime or violence, and/or loaded with SFX. But neither is it a smooth-edged fairytale. Director Gus Van Sant, working to a screenplay by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, has opted for a realistic context, especially when it comes to Will's roughneck pals. One result of this is the bad language, which apparently offends some viewers. (For the later, superficially similar, Finding Forrester, set in the Bronx, Van Sant seemed to take a more cautious route.)Damon is excellent as the closet mathematical genius, Will Hunting, who prefers his delinquent lifestyle and the comradeship of his blue-collar buddies to possible academic acclaim. Once again, Robin Williams demonstrates that when cast in a grown-up role he can ditch most of his annoying mannerisms; his portrayal of Sean Maguire, a psychologist able to help others, but unable to help himself get over the death of his wife, is convincing and moving. Affleck as Will's best buddie, and Minnie Driver as Will's rich student girlfriend, have important supporting roles. Each character demonstrates a stage in what seems the main theme of the film - seeking, finding, and keeping hold of, yourself.One weak spot is that the movie doesn't bring out clearly enough the conflict between Will's ""discoverer"" Prof Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) and Maguire. Lambeau wants Will to gain fame and fortune for the benefit of science (and his own kudos); Maguire is more interested in Will making his own choice, whatever that is. Those who think the film has a neat, happy ending should consider how Lambeau and Maguire will each view Will's action.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Would Prefer "" Lars And The Real Girl "" But Not Bad At All :)","Do you know that suicide is one of the three top causes for deaths ?In America specifically , teens and adults too ( 20s and 30s ) then it falls below the third place starting from 40 . Unfortunately , for the whole humanity , we bust ourselves working to find a cure for all pains , and find something to lower deaths' rate of Cancer , heart diseases and AIDS , .. etc but we don't even try to give a shot at one of the most important cause of death , suicide , a person's psychology and inside .As a student in Med school , interested in Psychiatry in specific , I try all the time to look for movies with the portray of psychiatrists and I get shocked at what Hollywood gives . It almost always shows the therapist/psychiatrist as a totally useless person with some books around . A psychiatrist can save someone . Although I feel the movie is lacking some elements , it's good and deep . I don't know why in specific , but I there are other movies with psychological experiences which are better than this . I recommend it for the ones who would like to see a good drama and some psychological aspects of the human mind . I wouldn't recommend it , however , for someone who's a little more advanced , either as a psychiatrist/therapist or even as moviegoer who's seen deeper ones . Robin Williams was phenomenal . Still , many elements were missing if one wanted to tangle such a thought . I give it a 7 because of its originality back in 1997 and because of the relatively few fascinating scenes as the one at the lake . I would also recommend "" Lars And The Real Girl "" ( mostly ) , "" Crash "" ,"" August: Osage County "" and "" Silver Linings Playbook "" for anyone who agrees with me . They are similar but a lot deeper and will give you wonderful insights into how the human psyche works :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Very Emotional Drama!,"Good Will Hunting is just a very great drama from the late 90's I believe if it was not for Titanic, this movie would have swept the Oscars. This movie did deserve to win the screenplay award. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really wrote a fine script.This is about some hotshot kid who is always getting into trouble. It's up to some psychology professor to change the ways of the kid or else he will be spending time in jail.This is the first serious movie I have seen that featured Robin Williams. He did a very good job and I was impressed. Matt Damon is likable in any movie he's in. Ben Affleck did a decent job as well.There are some powerful scenes that may have people in tears.

A Feel Good film with the best script!,"I recently watched it after a four year absence and thought very highly of it.  I wasn't to keen at first a while back but I have matured and understood what the film was trying to get across and thought it was very clever the way they did it.  Without the acting in this then their would be no Good Will Hunting and I wouldn't be reviewing this film now and the same goes for the script.    This is one of Ben Affleck's good films and the same has to be said for Matt Damon but I am yet to see a bad Affleck/Damon film, then again I am the only person who hasn't seen Gigli but I will blame J.Lo for that.   But the script alone is a masterpiece of writing from both of them.  It has the making to make you feel bad and feel good all at the same time without breaking a sweat which brings me on to telling you another reason why I admire this so much.   It doesn't stop for a second.  Even though there is no big plot to follow and any suspense there is always something happening in each scene of the film which is just terrific for a film of this type.    If I was to compare another film made recently to Good Will Hunting then it would be Lost in Translation.  Both films have characters who are lost and are afraid and the mood of the film is very bleak if a little up lifting at times.  Good Will Hunting just isn't a great drama though, it's also a great comedy as there are many funny scenes where you giggle a lot with anything from Casey Affleck trying to act hard in front of his friends or Robin Williams making funny remarks about everything that surrounds him.I did feel very emotional towards the end but also uplifted and felt good about myself.   I was expecting someone to die in this as it is your typical ending for a story like this one. Though much to my delight Affleck and Damon kept there cool very well and bowed out with a more sombre end with one of the best lines in film for the last Decade said by Robin Williams when he reads the note that will left for him.Affleck and Damon have more potential than you would think and I look forward to their next pairing as I heard they were getting together to write another script after a number of box office flops.  At least if they do we are pretty sure to get something special, so hurry up the both of you before people really turn against you and don't see you for the talent duo that you are.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
