Good survival horror,"I had to sift long and deep for a good comment on this. Why all the hostility? I think there was great chemistry on this production and it shows; the actors and crew involved loved the game and had a good time making this. This movie successfully recreated the feel of the game, and because it kept exposition to a minimum of what you needed to know for this particular story and didn't borrow from or revise any of the original characters or settings, it supported and strengthened the franchise. No story is retold here, no words are wasted, the setting, feel and pace is familiar to fans of Resident Evil and yet it's perfectly accessible to those unfamiliar with the broader storyline. Not giving the fan-boys their favorite characters was a good choice since characters tend to get mangled in adaptation, and yet the fan-boys still complain. With this film you have a good, watchable story that can partake of the Resident Evil cosmology, showing it due respect.It did an excellent job establishing characters without too much unnecessary background, developing them just enough to make you want to know what they'll do next, to make you care before the sudden and gruesome happens to them. The acting was above par for a Resident Evil, certainly much better than the first game. The plot was no more comic bookish than any of the games. My one complaint was that the characters were too battle-trained, too slick, too good at fighting for them to be sympathetic horror subjects. This could've been balanced out with more reaction shots showing the soldiers wetting themselves. But Alice's over-the-top commando-style action made her too much of a super heroine to really make anyone concerned about her survival; characters made of Teflon make good action but apathetic horror subjects.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't listen to the critics -- great flick,"I originally watched ""Resident Evil"" at a movie theater when it was first released in 2002. I hadn't played the games. There was no Rotten Tomatoes and I didn't read reviews back then so I went in blind. And I utterly enjoyed the movie: the story, the action sequences, the underground ""Hive,"" Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez kicking serious ass, and more.Panned by critics (36% RT) but liked by users (67% RT), Resident Evil was one of the first examples of how mainstream critics just don't ""get"" horror. Movies that try to be artsy get great reviews even as key elements fall flat for the rest of us. The recent ""Beach House"" is a perfect example of this -- it was loved by critics (81% RT) and panned by users (28%).Unfortunately, the rest of the ""Resident Evil"" sequels except for a few moments, rarely captured that first movie's originality and allure. Instead, check out the writer/director's excellent previous outing ""Event Horizon.""",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil,"Exactly the right movie at exactly the right time. The music and atmosphere, the sets and costume design, the special effects, the cast. Everything lined up perfectly for a young shaggy. That kid was a gothy nerd with love for video-games, horror, industrial music and Mila Jovovich. This movie managed to check all the boxes. Watching it now, it still pretty much holds up. Maybe a little cheesy but stylish and entertaining. 6 stars for watchability, one for nostalgia.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Finally, a video game adaption done right","This movie means business. Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes. It keeps up the pace throughout. In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once. I only enjoyed Star Wars once, but I don't think it sucked, it just didn't have a lot of depth. Not every movie has to be Citizen Kane.It was an engaging story, moved like lightning and had some excellent scares.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly Entertaining,"I was generally surprised that I liked this movie, not being a fan of either of it's stars.  I decided to give the movie a try since it does deal with one of my favorite horror topics...zombies!As a horror movie Resident Evil fails miserably, it's not scary and contains only small amounts of suspense.  It is much better as an action film although much of the action is chaotic, accompanied by lame heavy metal/thrash music.  But seeing as it is based on a video game and made primarily for teenage boy video game addicts it is quite good in and of itself.The movie plays well, even though it is apparent that some scenes have been cut to achieve an R-rating.  The characters do what they need to do in order to survive.One small problem with the movie is the relative lack of zombie screen time. They do appear in two major scenes but most of the time the hallways are clear.  This hive was supposed to employ thousands of people but you only ever see 100 zombies at the most.  Also, the humans seem to be able to travel easily wherever they have to go until it is time for another action sequence.  It would have been better if they constantly ran into single zombies which they were able to easily dispose of, but this is nit-picking on my part.Overall I enjoyed the movie and I have never seen, let alone played, the video game.  I'm not sure if this movie will have the staying power over multiple viewings for me (like Aliens) but it's a very good single viewing action picture.  Easily the best movie I have seen based on a video game. Despite it's flaws Resident Evil rates a 7 out of 10, if taken more seriously this could have been a really good movie.  It would have been nice to see a George Romero version.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""I've been a bad, bad girl""","Recently I saw the theatrical trailer for Resident Evil: Extinction and it occurred to me, I have never seen the first two Resident Evil films, and I always wanted to see them. So I rented the first two Resident Evil films and watched them last night. I had a lot of fun watching Resident Evil, it was very high action and kept my heart racing on what would happen next. This is a great movie based on a video game, this is the kind of movie that we need if we are talking about basing it on a video game. I haven't seen a good one since Mortal Kombat. The action and effects were so awesome not to mention that there are some very awesome scares in here. Very cool make up for the zombies; and the story was excellent.A virus breaks out in a lab called the Hive where everyone is held in captivity and dies. All of a sudden we see a woman passed out in a shower, she has no idea who she is, she meets two other men who have no idea who they are, but they are taken by soldiers who take them underground to the Hive. There the three learn that they are fighters for this out break and that also they might be part of what happened. The main thing is that they control the Hive, but that gets more difficult when the virus has turned the people it killed into the living dead, zombies. The woman, Alice, turns into the leader and must find out why this happened and also how they can get out alive without contaminating the world.Resident Evil was an awesome movie to watch and I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves action movies. If you loved Mortal Kombat I'm sure you'll love Resident Evil. There are so many great scenes, but my favorite was when Alice saw the evil dogs and they chased her throughout the lab, it was really scary but so awesome to watch. Well, you'll just have to see what I mean. Milla Jovovich was just a perfect choice for Alice, she is such a cool character and now I'm really looking forward to seeing Extinction.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent Game/Movie adaptation.,"Altho not following the game in every aspect, which is a GOOD THING, it still manages to relate to the game in a lot of ways, all while keeping it's identity. Greatly chosen cast, all worth the while, with pretty solid visuals for the period of time, including CGI of course. Great costumes also by the way!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Way better than what I expected,"I wasn't waiting to see anything amazing when I started watching for this movie, since almost all the license movies have been terrible... Fortunately, my opinion was to change! Movie was great, actors were good enough, and there was actually a plot (whoa!). Director has done a great job by having that videogame atmosphere by use of light, but still keeping the movie tense. Marilyn Manson has also made a great job by composing some of his greatest soundtrack titles which really fit for this movie. I have played both Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2, and recognized many of the scenes which were kind of similar to games. What can I say? For the people who have played games, this one gives good vibes and they are going to love it. For regular people the movie might be above the average. This was one hell-of-a-movie, and I'm waiting for the sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid!!,"As a big fan of splatter and horror films i was gladly surprised when i watched this. I haven't played the game so i had no idea what to expect and had nothing to compare with. I really feel that this pays homage to the old zombie films at least to an extent. The zombies here are a little bit faster though.It begins with a nice back story and then builds slowly in pace to a climactic frenzy. The effects are top notch, solid directing, a really imaginative and eerie production design and great acting.Yes, i may be a little biased but i really like Milla Jovovich. I think this is the kind of role that fits her best, strong kick ass attitude with an odd personality wrapped in a seemingly fragile shell. Her performance here reminds me a bit of the character she played in ""The fifth element"" and also the character in the later ""Ultraviolet"" The other actors did a good job as well so she's not the only one to get credit although the movie revolves around her character. The child AI is a very nice and creepy addition to the atmosphere.The RE theme could have ended up as a nice trilogy but the sequel unfortunately lacks nearly everything(except Milla) that this film delivers. Not that RE2 is a complete mess but nowhere near this. I haven't seen the third installment yet but even if that one holds true in quality to this one number two becomes the odd one out.If you like zombie and action films you'll certainly like this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Feels like a fresh take on the zombie genre,"I was surprised with how much I enjoyed Resident Evil.

This feels like a fresh take on the zombie genre and I would be happy to add it to my collection of horror films.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Really, REALLY, Bad","The two main things about this movie that bothered me the most are as follows:1:  They never established a sense of utter hopelessness.  In any Zombie flick this is the key.  Zombies are dumb, clumsy, and slow.  The only way to make them a true threat is to have your heroes in as small and unescapable place as possible, and to have HORDES of zombies for miles and miles as far as the eye can see.  It has to seem hopeless. While it was clear from the start that at least 2/3 of the supposedly highly trained paramilitary team was expendable, at no time was Milla Jovavich in any danger.  There are scenes in this movie where five or six soldiers are being swarmed by Zombies, and despite all their training and vast weaponry, they can do little.  Then Ms. Jovavich, in her ripped up nightgown and with no weapons at all, drops in on them and goes Bruce Lee for three minutes, and, there ya go, no more Zombie threat. BULL!!2.  While they did seem to spend a decent amount on the special effects for the zombies, the main Mutated Beast that comes at them in the end looked like something Ray Harryhausen might have done for one of his movies in the 60's.  Which is not a slight to Mr. Harryhausen at all.  Clash of the Titans and Jason and the Argonauts are two of my favorites, and a documentary on Mr. Harryhausen put me in awe of his talents. But the claymation-like movements of the Mutant in this movie really clashed with all the rest of the high tech goings on.All in all, if you want a decent Zombie movie, go rent ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Zombie"", an unnoficial Italian sequel that came out before Mr. Romero came out with ""Dawn of the Dead"".  If you go with ""Resident Evil"", you will regret it before you finish the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Killer Action/Zombie Hybrid,"This one's been in development for quite some time and I was disappointed when George Romero left the project.First off,the trailer for this movie made me sweat,because it wasn't very good.Thankfully the movie rocked.By far the best game-inspired flick to date and a heck of a good ride.All the way across the board:good acting,good f/x,awesome soundtrack and score(Marilyn Manson-who'd a thought),excellent production design and top-notch direction.All-in-all a very satisfying dark run through the bowls of the Unbrella corporation....Watch out for the Red Queen and bring on RE#2.Come Get Some(sorry Duke).ENJOY!",,Anonymous,Horror
Good fun movie.,"Entertaining movie based on a video-game. That's not an easy job.They managed to create a compelling personal story for the main protagonist (Mila) and explained the context and plot very efficiently.Once the action kicks in, the pace is great and the survival aspect mesh really well with the intriguing plot. The characters are thin, of course, but they work too, without annoying ""comic-relief only"" or ""the defenseless"".I don't know, but I'm sure someone could find plot-holes, but overall, if they exist, you don't notice while watching this good video-game zombi movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

O.K. at Best...,"I am going to keep this short and sweet, and without spoilers.The video game, Resident Evil, changed my life. It was the first video game that I had ever played that brought the experience of ""living a horror movie"" home on my Playstation. The game is exciting, dark, unnerving, original, and generates incredible atmosphere with it's blend of sound effects, eerie music, engaging storyline and characters, and innovative game play. The game succeeds in every way, and this movie fails in every attempt it makes to recreate the experience.The movie retains about 30% of the original premise of the video game, and fills the void with a bunch of characters, events and locations that have nothing to do with, and never appeared in, any of the games. This is pretty much ""Resident Evil"" in name only: there are a few monsters that appeared in the game, and the film merges some of the aspects of the Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2 games.The sequels in the Resident Evil video game series that followed, and continue to follow, range from fantastic to mediocre, but ALL of them are better than this movie.First of all, I agree with my brother when he says that ""Anderson is a hack"". If you need proof of that fact that Anderson is NOT a good director, just observe how can take wonderful, engaging stories and turn them into lifeless, generic, Hollywood-friendly steaming piles of crap that he can peddle to the masses who need only a an action-packed, brainless film to lure them, salivating, to the box office.If you are a huge fan of the games, and have followed their story lines closely, you will most likely HATE what Anderson has done to this series. As it stands by itself, this movie is OK at best. As a part of the Resident Evil phenomenon, it's pretty much just crap.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A proper popcorn sci-fi horror movie,"First things first, I really like ""Resident Evil"". While I can't comment on the success of the conversion to a movie as I've never played any of the numerous video games, the film is beautifully shot and has an urgent pace. It also has a great looking cast, a thumping soundtrack and plenty of boys' toys.Milla Jovovich is stunning as the heroine, Alice. Whoever thought of casting Jovovich in this role deserves a bonus. Watching this beautiful star kick various forms of zombie butt while wearing a short red dress is a wonderful experience.Anderson's movies may be accused of being style over substance but there's no doubting that ""Shopping"", ""Event Horizon"" and ""Resident Evil"" are fantastic examples of eye candy. Every shot is beautifully composed and the film has a high-budget sheen.8 out of 10. Casio G-Shock fans will be in their element watching this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I was so very disappointed with this film!,"What can I say about this film, apart from it was terrible and I hated it!I loved the games and was looking forward to seeing the film, and I was bored throughout the film, but not throughout the WHOLE film. One or two half decent scenes and one scene of action that will stick in anyone's mind (you'll know which scene I mean if you see it), but unfortunately that is it! Most of the scenes or either too wordy and bored me, or the room is that full of zombie's that you can't pick out the characters! And the flashback scenes are also far too abstract!!!I left the film feeling as though I had wasted 1hr 40 of my life and it could have been better used down the pub or even standing in the rain for 1hr 40 would have pleased me more!I have seen the film twice (to my disgust!) and STILL I don't know character names, only one, and I have even looked them up on imdb.com before watching it for the second time! I STILL don't feel any empathy for the characters and basically I didn't care if the made it out or not!I prey to God himself that the sequel is better (Resident Evil: Nemesis [2003]) and I hope that it does the games the tiniest bit of justice, unlike this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Non-stop fun and unimaginable good, bloody action","Resident Evil is probably my favorite zombie movie next to Planet Terror. It had flaws, some acting was poor, but still was one great time from start to finish and excellently crafted entertainment!!!!! It had wonderful action, nice gore and the performances overall were exceedingly decent for what they needed to be for a video game adaptation. I especially love Michelle Rodriguez's portrayal of Pain; amazing character.I first thought when I was watching this film that it was going to be an over-the-top gore movie with way to much blood and carnage, not so much as focusing on the main point of the story, but it turned out unimaginably well, for I thought it wasn't going to be that good at all, and the complexity and edgy scenes and screenplay surprised me. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez acted wonderfully in this film and this was a great action\horror movie that I am extremely glad I was able to have seen, and will gladly see over and over again.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than expected.,"""Resident Evil"" didn't exactly received raving reviews when it got released. It however is an enjoyable action flick with some horror elements in it, that is worth seeing.Looks like only people really disappointed with this movie were and are the fans of the video games this movie is based on. The movie has very little to do with the video games but should that automatically mean that the movie is a bad one? I don't think that's exactly fair assumption. You should just take this movie for what it is; An action/horror movie that happens to be loosely BASED on a video game. As a movie it really isn't bad. It might not be the best or most original movie, it still is an enjoyable action flick that is perfectly watchable.Still its a movie with flaws. Biggest flaw is the continuity. Not everything that happens in the movie makes logically sense. for instance in the beginning of the movie all of the characters are suddenly split up, without any explanation why and how this happened and of course every character gets a bad encounter during their split up. There are several tiny things like this in the movie that don't make logical sense from a story point of view and the continuity and editing are weak and flawed at times. All little hints that director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't the greatest director in the business.The movie also isn't exactly successful as an horror. Most of the scare moments in the movie fail and are too much and too often the same. The action is good, although predictable. Nothing in the movie happens as a real surprise and because of that it also never really becomes tense or truly exciting. It's really one of those ""Aliens""-wannabe movies. It's too bad but it doesn't automatically mean that this movie is a bad one. It's still a movie made with lots of style and profession and even though it isn't the most original movie it still is a successful one, from a movie technical point of view.It's obvious that Milla Jovovich was just cast because of her looks but she does a fair enough job in this movie. Michelle Rodriguez is a good action movie star and Colin Salmon is a great actor but his role is too limited. The movie could had really used his acting abilities and his character more. The wonderful Jason Isaacs also has a uncredited cameo toward the ending of the movie and also as narrator.A movie worth seeing at least once. You might end up liking it better than expected, as with me was the case.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody fantastic!,"This has to be the best zombie-mutant-shoot-'em-up-splatter-film I've seen in years! It rocks, it rolls, it's lock and load entertainment of the finest kind! And certainly not for the faint of heart or even weak of stomach!Not having played the game, I can't comment on the film's accuracy. But Resident Evil, unlike previous attempts to transfer video games to the big screen, is a great action film in its own right.The plot is very simple: A team of elite commandos is sent into an underground laboratory to find out what caused the death of several thousand employees. Of course, an evil corporation has been evilly getting up to evil tricks and nasty things are lurking in dark corners.Now forget the plot and fasten your seat belts as the elite team is not only taken apart by some cool special effects but also finds itself on the menu as hors d'oeurvres, entrée and dessert for a horde of ravening zombies, mutated Dobermanns with attitude and a giant...thingy!Writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson pulls out all the stops as the countdown ticks down and the bodycount steadily mounts. There are moments that will make you jump and your pulse race, gunfire aplenty, loads of narrow escapes and some great ""Oh ****!"" moments; all to a pounding rock beat.There's more than enough blood and guts shown, figuratively as well as on the floors, walls and ceiling, to satisfy all but the sickest of individuals (Hi Susi!) and full credit goes to the prosthetics, make-up and special effects departments.Milla Jovovich makes an excellent kick-zombie heroine (and I for one, would volunteer to have my neck snapped like a dry twig between her thighs anytime!) as does Michelle Rodriguez as one of the troopers.Resident Evil is everything Tomb Raider should have been and wasn't. If you've lost faith in ever seeing a video game successfully make it to the big screen, you will believe again. If you won't see this film because it's based on a video game, you will be missing out in a big way. Overcome your prejudices, I did, and finally get your money's worth from a trip to the cinema.Producer Bernd Eichinger's Constantin Film has recently had its name attached to some very dubious offerings (All the Queens Men, for example, or 666-Trau keinem mit wem du schläfst - trust me, you do not want to know!). But with Resident Evil the company is well and truly back on top of the game.Now where's the sequel??!!",,Anonymous,Horror
The Most Atmospheric One,"One day I sat and thought it could be nice re-watching some of the horror franchises real proper like, and all six ""Resident Evil"" installments happen to be somewhere far back in the viewing history. Having played a couple parts a little, I'm not well-versed in the gaming lore of ""Resident Evil"", so I won't talk much about those angles. Can't say I was a big fan of the films back then, but let's see the perception now. As the unforgettable Marilyn Manson's theme instrumental sets in, I'm cozy and ready.
Very quickly we get introduced to world's largest commercial entity, the Umbrella Corporation, their huge secret lab dubbed ""The Hive"", laying under Raccoon City, and the genetic experiments they carry on down there, as well as the T-virus. A yet unknown figure sabotages the operation and releases the virus, causing a rogue AI to shut off the hive and trap everyone inside. A special military unit gets sent in, on the way picking Milla Jovovich with a pretty bad memory lass. She is none other than Alice, as she'll reaffirm that to us for the rest of the franchise.In the essence, ""Resident Evil"" is a familiar story with some cheese and plenty of cliché characters, but it is happily aware of that. A horror survival story, made less routine with over-stylized action sequences, maddening editing, injection of humor by the good cast of characters, and the ever-beautiful femme fatale Milla Jovovich, for the most part in just a couple layers of clothes, of course. Acting is good throughout the film, and besides the main attractions, dames Milla and Michelle, props from me to Martin Crewes portraying the poor team's tech guy Kaplan. Kaplan had the most stressful jobs... The story uses same old blueprint tropes, and ends in seemingly the only way it every could've, apocalyptically more hopeless and setting up a sequel.Though I haven't yet re-watched the sequels, I doubt anything is going to change the fact that this is the most horror part of the franchise, the one that feels to justify the genre the most, because it's not only blowing zombie brains on rock music waves that makes horror. ""Resident Evil"" is the most atmospheric of the franchise, and I believe a role in that plays the sets - all underground, having a little long-term claustrophobic effect, as well as color grading, it's all red, white, black, silver, more red... Cold tones. Having said all this, psychological dread is not something this film possesses. ""Resident Evil"" is a decent horror movie that could've been a great one. A complaint with little weight, but the outdated ccgi didn't help, though there are also practical effects at play.In many ways of style, ""Resident Evil"" embodies a lot of what was high on top during the early 2000's, from the set and costume design to (outdated) FX, to industrial music, to the overall tone. If you're a fan of such vibes, zombies, Milla or the games, check it out! Though I don't find it likely You haven't already. My rating: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
is this the best video game adaptation ever?,"Resident Evil is burdened with a bunch of ""bad movie"" hallmarks: cheap CGI, stilted acting, rough dialogue, sweaty acting, etc. However, underneath all that is a super fun movie about systemic blaming of individuals for sins of the system that they're stuck in.

A Well Made Microsoft - Zombies Film,"I do not like zombies movies. It's a matter of taste, but none of the after-death genres really speaks to me. I must however confess having enjoyed 'Resident Evil', especially because it is very well made - but I might have never seen it if I knew what it is about when I rented it from my local Blockbuster. This would have been a miss.The director, Paul Anderson seems to specialize in movies inspired by computer games (another sign of the culture of our times, but why not?). This is his second one after 'Mortal Kombat', and it works much better. His other sources of inspiration are Lewis Carrol's Alice, '2001 - The Space Odissey', and of course the other zombies movies in the last 20 years. The combination works, and I think that this is first of all because of the clear and sure director hand. The story line is of a corporate having almost total control of home computers ('evil' Microsoft comes in mind immediately), and performing secret biological weapons experiments behind the scenes. When something goes wrong, zombies are not late to show up and start eliminating the humans around. It's not especially original, but all is well linked, there are no major  flaws, and even the quantity of pretentious laughable quotes is beyond the usual limit.Milla Jovovitch and Michelle Rodriguez are the feminine stars in the movie, easy to remember as they are both beautiful and well-casted. The rest of the actors team are decent. Effects are well filmed, and provide the needed quantity of horror for the fans of the genre.The sequel is already in making, and I intent to go and see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Only Milla Jovovich saved it.,"When Capcom's game of the same name first hit the market, it got many critic's praise due to its unique gaming style and for its excellent atmosphere of horror and suspense. Six years later, this movie version has neither followed the story or characters (this movie is rather a prequel of the game) nor presented that unique atmosphere of survival horror. In the end it turned out to be a cheap action movie with blazing guns, bloody gore, raw language and other accessories. The plot was a bit planned at the beginning but messed up in the end. Apart from all these, the movie simply rides the top with the help of a new fresh Milla Jovovich.Well, when you place Ms. former Joan of Arc in a skimpy red party dress with an assault rifle in hand you win half of the battle. But besides Milla is lucky to have a fine character on which the director offered much more attention than the story itself. And indeed she is good in such roles. And she was well assisted by good background soundtrack and camera angles. And a provocative ending too, allowing the viewers to dream whatever they can for Resident Evil 2.In all, the movie is actually nothing. You go just to watch Milla. and considering that I'm giving it no more than ***.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Then my friend told me that it was written and directed by Paul Anderson [MORTAL KOMBAT, SOLDIER] and I suddenly had an urge to see it since Paul Anderson has never made a bad movie [in my opinion]. The reviews made this sound like an awful movie, but the truth is it's one of the better movies of 2002 [so far]. There's tons of great action sequences, lots of horror, and for this type of movie, there were surprisingly good performances from Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and Eric Mabius. Even though it isn't a perfect movie, I'd still recommend it.",,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty Solid,"I remembered seeing this movie back in the theater, and hadn't watched it since so I thought I would watch it again since I wanted to watch all the RE movies and hadn't seen the last few (or any after the second one). 
The movie holds up surprisingly well after all these years - I mean the overall tone of the movie is clearly dated - it *feels* like a late 90's movie - not that that is bad per se. The acting is mediocre, but I never really care too much about that anyway. I just rate stuff on if I am entertained or not and I can say that I was indeed with this movie. It also helps that it is about 90 minutes. I don't think this style of movie could go on for much more than that - the jarring soundtrack I think would get a little too over the top if I had to keep hearing it for another 30 minutes. 
Overall the movie still hold up and is entertaining all these years later. Still worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best in the series.,"I first seen this back in 2004 on a VHS copy that my buddy owned, he myself and another buddy watch it together.Since It was my first experience seeing the movie I totally loved it,
which was surprising because at the time I wasn't sure about it, since it was
a horror movie, I stayed away from them a lot as a little kid.
The suspense is quite creepy but not too creepy because it's also an action
movie blended in to one, however this first installment is more suspense with
good jump scares and small action scenes.
The pace is fast and the movie is kinda edgy in music and action sequences,
I've seen the remake of the original game which my one buddy owns on Game Cube, it's good but also really creepy and I like that the movie captured that essence.
Alice played by MIlla Jovovich is the heroine of the film, who has amnesia,
as we met her she comes to the shower, which looks like she hit her head,
she is oblivious to things as the audience is, we lean what's going on as she
does. Which I feel is fresh for as zombie movie.The movie is 100 minutes but fairly fast paced and has an engaging story,
so you met characters as the movie goes. Alice is joined by special forces-like
operatives that inform her and a couple other characters about what's
going on.
Video game purists will not like this movie but casual audiences will probubly
enjoy it, it's made to be popcorn fun that's all, it should not be looked at as
anything else but a fun movie however haters will hate so each there own I
guess.Overall I enjoy the film to this day, for me it's a guilty pleasure.
I give it a 7/10. If you want a fun but suspenseful action film
with fun action scenes and great scares look no further.
Give it a look. It's fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Good Game-To-Film Adaptation,"The Umbrella Corporation is a top secret company operating from a massive underground facility known as The Hive. After a deadly virus is released into the air, resulting in the deaths of all who work there, an elite squad of soldiers is sent in to shut down The Hive before the virus has a chance to escape into general population of the city above. It's here that they come across Alice (Mila Jovovich) who has no memory of who or where she is. As they continue down into The Hive, Alice starts to regain her memory bit by bit, but they all soon discover that shutting down the The Hive is the least of their worries when they learn that the human population have returned to life as vicious zombies.Resident Evil is one of the much more enjoyable game-to-movie adaptations as usually these are pretty mediocre or just plain awful (Street Fighter, Double Dragon, Super Mario Bros. etc), and fans of the game should be pretty pleased with this movie version as well, especially as the makers of the movie have brought in the formidable creature known as Licker who features in the game also.The action for the movie is really good, which is accompanied by a pumping soundtrack to get the adrenalin going that wee bit more as well. A good few special effects are really well done also, especially in the scene that involves the Red Queen using a laser as a defence system, and the effects for Licker was impressive making it just as scary in the film as it was in the game.Just one thing - this isn't a gore-fest of a zombie movie either and concentrates more toward the story, so if you're expecting (or hoping for) lots of splatter then you'll be highly disappointed.Resident Evil is an enjoyable film to watch. It's not a thinker of a movie, obviously, but it's not supposed to be and doesn't pretend to be either. Also, don't expect an exact game-to-movie film. It's an adaptation OF the game, so enjoy it for what it is - a good zombie horror/sci-fi action film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun action-horror,"The first in a decade-and-a-half-long film series inspired by the 1996 Capcom video game of the same name, Resident Evil transforms its source material from gothic survival horror to modern action-horror, complete with prominent electronic music, stock action characters, and CGI violence. Although the movie's uninspired shock sounds, dated computer graphics, choppy flashbacks, and stereotypical casting foreshadow the weaknesses of its vastly inferior sequels, Resident Evil benefits from a solid mystery plot, detailed art direction, and a charismatic performance by Milla Jovovich as a mordern, grown up Alice in Wonderland. The result is a fun thriller whose lack of graphic violence does not dampen the horror of the Umbrella Corporation's cavalier attitude toward human life.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good action movie,"I saw this when it first was up on the big screen, and then while I thought it was pretty cool I kinda forgot about it. Then a few days ago I saw it on TV, and I have to say, it's definitely better than I remember it now.It starts out in a slightly surreal style as we get to follow the employees of the Umbrella Corp., and the events leading to the disaster in the underground laboratory. Then in the same style we get to follow an agent waking up and how she meet the SWAT-like squad she's to work together with to set things straight again.The overall feeling of the movie is hard to describe but I like it. No nonsense, just straight forward action. No second wasted. I am sure there were clichés in this film but certainly not many and apparently they didn't bother me anyway. Usually when you watch a B action you can get bored simply because it's like every other B action. Not so with Resident Evil, which was not B in my opinion.Visually, it's also great. At times it was almost a dream-like feeling, from the intro laboratory scenes to the scenes from Alice's home; and most that happened thereafter.As for storytelling, it told us what we needed to know, nothing more. If there's anything from the introduction scenes that leaves us wondering what in the world happened, who did it and why, we will get the answers as the story moves on.Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriquez both make their parts really well in my opinion. I have not seen Milla in many other movies but what I've seen so far, I definitely like. Michelle was entirely new to me as far as I know, but I liked her performance.My complaint could possibly be that some devices in the laboratory seemed a bit of a stretch, especially one particular security defense mechanism that they encountered early on.All in all, a good action that is somewhat unusual in its style.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than I thought,"This really does seem like it was a movie intended for fans of the ""Resident Evil"" game. I've seen some of the sequels and they're not as good. I'm not familiar with the games, but as far as I know, this was pretty faithful to them. There was, however this one major problem that kept me from liking it. The CGI was simply terrible! I'm sorry, but while the practical effects were fairly nice to look at, a lot of this movie was just plain ugly! Now, I know that it's not meant to be Shakespeare. It does seem a lot like a video game.I appreciate it when people are loyal to the fanbase. The pacing is this film is kind of on and off. It gets a bit too fast into it, but then again, a lot of the film is well put together. I actually do feel for some of these characters even though I'm not familiar with the games. I also like how this does set up a story that is used for more movies, even if they're not that great of a product. It probably helps that I'm into zombies.

An impressive take on the zombie genre.,"'Resident Evil' is very different to most zombie films out there. The film revolves around a very powerful company, the Umbrella Corporation, which - unbeknownst to most of their employees - also designs and manufactures warfare weapons. The Hive is an impressively designed underground mega structure which houses over 500 scientists. We soon learn the company is being sabotaged, and it is this very sabotage that would ultimately lead to devastating consequences, as we discover in later installments in the franchise. Spence (James Purefoy) is the man responsible for this sabotage.We really don't know much about Alice (Milla Jovovich) during the first half of the movie. This is a very clever and interesting set-up for a character that is to lead six films. Her beauty is utilized by sensual photography and poses - very well integrated in the situations she finds herself in, and most unusual for a film of this genre, yet it works so well. The mystery surrounding her lingers for quite a while. In fact, we keep guessing and speculating almost until the very end.What starts as a rescue operation ends in a fight for survival in an excellent display of fantastic visuals and make-up effects, and lots of action. The film grows more intense as it progresses, and all the more awesome - if you have the stomach for it, that is. It is thrilling from beginning to end, with nail-biting suspense from the opening scene until the closing finale. It is so fast-paced, it hardly allows the viewer time to catch its breath. Be warned, there are highly effective jump scares! I loved this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Almost Constant Soundtrack makes this an great cybernetic atmosphere,"Since I was 15 i've heard my friends talking about this movie. It's impressive a guy like me, that have had watched a thousand movies still didn't look for Resident Evil.Well, RE starts trying to make us want for more. Not just the first scene, but the whole movie. It didn't called my attention that much at the beginning, but te final scenes did. I wanna watch the sequence right now.The best about RE is it's soundtrack. It's what makes this movie convincing, entertaining, frightening and apprehensive at the same time. Even if the soundtrack isen't that original. It is pretty well placed in the right moments, and it's almost constantly throughout the movie. This , and not the scenario is what makes it have a cybernetic_high-tech atmosphere.RE's photography could really be better, a little bit more of dark would be welcome. And talking about photography, I also must say about special effects and GCI computer generated imagery). In 1999, Matrix have had presented us with amazing special effects and cgi, soon, I truly believe monsters could be improved 3 years later, in Resident Evil. Even if it's not the same company working on it.Actors are not that great and sometimes pretty bad, script is the easier ever written. I've watched on English (I'm Brazilian) and still did understand everything they were saying, giving the simplicity of it's language.RE is and entertaining film, won't add much at your knowledge, nothing like cult-movies or the most intelligent ones, but you'll like to spend some hours watching it.Cheers.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not horror, but damn good action!","I am not a great fan of the games, I know about them and have spent a few hours in front of them. Not that they are bad but I did lack the time.The movie acctually manages to capture the feeling of the games, very well indeed. The hopeless situation and the dejectedness of the people trying to survive. The movie also has a game like look and feel to it in the beginning. Watch the first scenes with Milla in the mansion and tell me if you agree...The game style diminishes when the action picks up in pace though. And it really do keep a nice pace trough the rest of the film.I was afraid that the end would spoil the movie in some way but it acctually lifted the overall impression one notch!One thing (the thing?) that I think could have been done better or even have been left out was the ""Big Monster"". It wasn't really state of the art and didn't really fit in. It didn't affect the overall feeling though and I can live with it.The story is good, it follows the original story with the evil Umbrella company performing illegal experiments and the effects of them is what we see. Screenplay lacks some but this isn't a drama, it's action so it doesn't really shine trough. Even the effects aren't that spectacular but they don't need to be. Less is more. Finally the movie score, I loved it! Hard, fastpaced and matched the movie close to perfectly.This is proof that computer games (console rather...) do make great movies. Just give the idea to the right person!7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Utterly Disappointing VideoGame Adaption,"This is quite possibly the worse VideoGame Adaption I have ever seen. Paul Anderson has 'hacked' his way into the VideoGame market, and created a blatant cash-in film. This is more like a rip-off of The Matrix than anything else. I am a HUGE fan of the videogame series. The Resident Evil videogames are my favorite games of all time, but this movie is really that BAD. The film follows the storyline of a group of 'ALIENS' type Commandos being sent into a Mansion of some sort, where a deadly Virus outbreak has occured. On the way, they meet Alice, a person who has lost her mind. And.....to hell with it. This film basically has no plot, or even if it has, it has been poorly constructed. The thing about the Resident Evil games, is that they have strong plots which guide you in. You really get drawn into it. This film is incredibly bland. The acting is absolutely terrible, and cringe worthy. It totally lacks atmohpere which the VideoGames provide. Let's see a small comparison between the Film and the Videogame: FILM : Hard rock-type music. - VIDEOGAME : Eerie, quiet, orchestral score. FILM : Bullet Time. - VIDEOGAME : No Bullet-Time seen. FILM : Kung Fu. - VIDEOGAME : No Bullet time. FILM : Bland Characters. VIDEOGAME : Interesting characters.It clearly comes to my attention, this film bares more resemblance to The Matrix than the Videogames. All characters are new (and very bland and one dimensional). We don't know them, and we never do. It's very unbelievable how a film like this could mess up the Resident Evil saga. The videogames are just begging for a movie version of themselves, and instead, we get something that offers nothing in common with the videogames. It's hard to believe this film was 'based' on them. I don't even think it is. This film feels like 'deja vu', we've seen it all before.Capcom made the biggest mistake of letting Paul Anderson near the Resident Evil series. They also made the mistake of firing George A Romero. Sure, Romero's script changed a few ideas, but it stuck the closest to the videogames. Romero was the only man to do a faithful adaption. Hell, the Resident Evil videogames are based off his ZOMBIE trilogy.Avoid Resident Evil The Movie at all costs. If you want a slice of Resident Evil, stick with the VideoGames, as they are the true spirit of Resident Evil. And if you want the true spirit of ZOMBIE movies, purchase George A Romero's Living Dead Trilogy. And if you want Kung Fu, Bullet-Time and cool characters......you know what movie to watch.RSIDENT EVIL THE MOVIE = 0/10",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

The zombies let it down,"I was never really into video games growing up, and I'm still not today. So a series like 'Resident Evil' just completely passed over my radar. With the 'Final Chapter' coming out shortly though I decided to go back and review the series to see what I think of it. Going back 14 years when it comes to a CGI heavy film can be a dodgy thing to do. Admittedly, there is a noticeable difference compared to the quality being produced today, but it's certainly not distractingly bad.I quite like films that are set in a confined space with the characters having to either work their way to the centre, or find a way out. This is one of those films and most aspects of it are done fairly well. The one element (that happened to be probably the biggest of them all sadly) that didn't work was the zombies. Zombies are simply not scary, not visually impressive and not entertaining. They're still better than vampires, but they are not a strong thing to have as a heavy component of your film.Having never played the game I can't confirm how close this is in terms of being true to it. I suspect though that it's pretty close. A lot of scenes feel like they're straight from a game and you can even imagine yourself having to pass the level that the characters are currently on. Milla Jovovich plays the lead role well, but I hope in the sequels she evolves a lot. At times in this one she felt like just another member of the squad, and certainly not the main character. People to this day say are still waiting for a great video game adaption to come out. 'Resident Evil' is a solid film, but it's certainly far from being great.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident evil?...more like Cube 3,"Where to start, I am a big fan of the Resident evil series (well the first 3 anyway) and once news reached my ears that they were making a movie of the first game I was pretty excited. But then I actually sat down to watch it, and to say the least was very disappointed with the out come.BIG SPOILERS AHEADThe film begins in an underground laboratory owned by the corporation Umbrealla inc. The lab is hidden deep within the basement of a mansion. Some asshole releases the virus the scientists are working on which can reanimate dead cells. The scientists get contaminated.Now when I saw this I thought fine its not 100% accurate but hey it still has the potential to be a great movie.NOThe computer within the lab goes psycho, sealing all the rooms off under quarantined regulations, then it begins wiping out all the scientists. Some woman wakes up who has lost all her memory. Deciding the time is right to go for a walk in the cold while wearing nothing but a highly revealing red dress she sets off on her journey, minuites later an army team burst through the windows and join her in her quest to do... not much. About 25 minutes further into the movie this team comes to a large hallway. The hallway leads to the computers core where they can shut it down. And low and behold the computer kills off 2/3 of the cast with its lasers faster than you can say ""danger Will Robbinson danger"" The survivors shut the computer down; zombies come out, and the team being of the greatest intellect decide the best way to execute the undead is by leg shots and shouting ""Stop"" a good 14 times. Team intelligence then decide they shouldn't have tried to switch the computer off, and so they switch the computer back on. Near the end of the film we are introduced to the ultimate biological weapon resembling a single licker, no I'm not kidding, they also incorectly name it a Hunter, where the hell is Tyrant you might ask? It's not as if it was an important part of the series, Tyrant virus and all. Our film draws to a close as the ""ultimate killing machine"" discovers its huge weakness it touches train tracks and promptly explodes.*yawn*The film has few plot twists which I wont spoil here. Most of the enemies from the series don't show up, in fact, the majority of the film concentrates on the evil computer not the creatures. Not even zombies.This movie would have been much better if it WASN'T called Resident Evil, but something else, anything else. Really, it bears little relation to the video games anyway besides the virus's and corporation's name and I still feel this film was only called Resident Evil so Paul Anderson could sell his hand me down script and market it towards a wider crowd (maybe this could be attributed to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within as well). The point is if this movie was called Cube 3 he could still get away with it. In fact this film probably is Cube 3, just named Resident Evil to attract fans of the series to watch this very average zombiefest.Oh well it can't be as bad as Street Fighter the movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Kick Ass film.,"During the primary literary phase of its development as an entertainment form, the gothic genre tended to involve a set of familiar ingredients - ruined buildings, virtuous heroines in distress, supernatural manifestations, heroic rescuers and loathsome villains, perhaps with a gang of bandits thrown in. Even though we call 'Gothic' simply 'Horror' these days, and even though most of us now visit this genre in its new home of the cinema more than on the pages of books, these ingredients have hardly changed over the years. Resident Evil is fascinating proof of this on two levels.On the most obvious level, for Ruined Building read The Hive - the abandoned but not-so abandoned biowarfare lab which is the principal location of this film. For virtuous heroine read Milla Jovovich wearing a dress as short as her legs are long; for supernatural manifestations. well, it's a zombie film. You get the point.On the second level, this film is a bit of an abandoned ruin itself, haunted by the wailing spirit of the film it might have been. You can see how the crumbling architecture might have formed a magnificent structure at one time - however, what separates this from every other romantic ruin you will ever visit, is simply that most ruins come to their tragic state of disrepair thanks to the gnawing of time's teeth, or violent misuse, and not simply because the owner got some cowboy in to build it in the first place.More of a folly than a ruin, then. Sometimes this film looks beautiful - the cameraman certainly knows how to present the lead actress in a favourable manner - I'm not sure Jovovich has looked quite so luminous on screen before. A pity, then, that the film is so awful taken as a whole.This is a film without sense, restraint, inspiration, or even excitement. It's not a good zombie film, not a good action film, and not a good science fiction film. It has an extraordinary trompe l'oeil quality that does, at times, deceive the viewer into thinking the film has some genuine quality - but it is deception only.What's more, it strikes me as rather bizarre that a film about zombies, with such obvious possible influences and precedents, should come across as being more interested in aping James Cameron than George Romero. Indeed, it is somewhat pointless since it is neither the first Aliens-wannabe, nor anything like the best-equipped to carry out such imitation; and this supposes that imitating another (perfectly good) film is even a good idea in the first place.The utterly pointless directorial allusion to Psycho which opens the film is entirely typical of the direction; so, like a jackdaw's nest, this film may contain many shiny and interesting things but it is simply a mess. Unlike a jackdaw's nest it isn't constructed of old twigs or covered in guano, nor has it fallen down a chimney into a fire yet - but we can always hope.I suppose utlimately what I find most objectionable about this exercise, and what makes me dislike it more than many other more obviously terrible films is that watching it you can actually see what a good film this could have been. This film earns contempt not so much for its mediocrity as for its wasted potential.I would have LOVED to see G.A. Romero make a comeback with a ""Resident Evil"" movie: zombies are his territory and he would have been able to pull some depth to it. Everything would have clicked, sure hit.10/10 If I could give it more I would.",,Anonymous,Horror

"I wanna be a zombie to meet Milla :P~~~... Besides, the movie rocks!","""Resident Evil"" is one of those films that I was expecting with great interest. When the first rumors begun, George A. Romero was in charge of the project. When he jumped out the film, the name of Paul W. Anderson appeared, and everybody thought ""That guy rings me a bell..."".After some research, you realize Anderson as the director of controversial films such as ""Mortal Kombat"" or ""Event Horizon"". And I say controversial because Paul's films have always had such great success and criticism both at the same time. And ""Resident Evil"" will be the next victim...""Mortal Kombat"" was a decent project that came out the same time ""Street Fighter"" did. I admit both films are not a perfection, but Anderson created a better film than Steven de Souza's one. So, and possibly because of the cheesy adaptation of CAPCOM's videogame, ""Mortal Kombat"" succeed in the duel, with good special effects and a few kicks and punches.""Event Horizon"" is one of my favourite movies, combining gore and horror in a very dark atmosphere, which makes this film unique in its genre. It went through the cinemas with little success, but now it's on my TOP10 list. Anderson did a fine job with this movie, helped with the cast crew that were incredible (Sam Neil and Laurence Fishburne).And now we have ""Resident Evil"". First, I quickly recognized the same dark atmosphere of ""Event Horizon"" in ""RE"". This strange way of Anderson to use the colours and the flashbacks, and also some scenarios were exactly reproduced from the videogame saga. The zombie makeup was very good, using CGI to create more realistic details. The Licker... well, if you survived watching the ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""'s monster, you'll manage this one :P.Also, the movie has got incredibly good soundtrack: hard rock from Marylin Manson, Fear Factory, Rammstein and many others; and it fits perfectly with the film. And in addition, the movie has got very good rythm of action, so it absorbs you inside.The good points of the film: Milla Jovovich (of course ^_^), Paul Anderson's peculiar style, tons of action, some good scares and brilliant rythm. The bad points: the cast crew doesn't give an incredible performance, the whole plot is quite messy and the ending is too unconcluded (Sequel needed right now!). And in several scenes you can see the microphone (Anderson check out the takes next time, please)!!! :-PWell, if you liked the other Paul Anderson productions (I haven't seen ""Soldier"", though), you'll really enjoy this one. And if you're also a fan of the videogames, then you'll die for watching ""Resident Evil"" again and again. Waiting for the RE2! Worth a look! 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I loved the way it was shot and the casting though none of the names were what I would consider big names. Michelle Rodriquez busts out and nearly steals the show from Milla. She is tough as nails and kicks butt but is still sexy as can be. Milla as Alice is just fantastic and dead on. She is great as the innocent confused Alice who can't remember who she is or what is going on. She sees these events through the confused eyes of an innocent.

"""RESIDENT EVIL was a surprise... Check it out if you want fun.""","I had not wanted to see this flick. The trailer sucked big time, I have never played the games, and I think Michelle Rodriguez is one of the worst actresses in the biz. I also did not find Milla Jovovich as attractive as most horror reviewers thought. Zombie movies aren't my favorite, and all this future stuff makes me sick. Haven't we had enough of the future? My god it's 2002, let's worry about 2002, not 2234. And why can't one director have the guts to change the way we see the future. Every one's god damn future is exactly the same! Shinny walls, computers with brains, stupid people, etc. But that's a whole different subject so back to Resident Evil.I sat and watched, not interested in the whole long explanation of what was happening on the earth at this time. I found myself asking questions like ""I wonder how much Panic Room will make this weekend,"" and ""I gotta buy The Book of the Dead DVD fast!"" Which is strange since the man only talked for about 45 seconds. When he shut the hell up, I cleared my mind, and watched. I thought, ""Oh my god, a camera with a brain,"" but I got myself fully focused when the dumb ass in the elevator got crushed. Now that's what I was looking for in this film. After all the action with the releasing of the virus, Milla Jovovich's character is introduced in this long drawn out scene. How the hell long does it take this girl to stand up! So far, so... well... decent.Well I don't want to go on with this play by play commentary so let me get to the goods. My view on Michelle Rodriguez didn't change one bit! Man, what a horrible actress. I also found it strange that this character is not at all like her character from The Fast and the Furious, yet she acts exactly the same in both! Now if that isn't the sign of a versatile actress, I don't know what is! However aside from the horrible dialogue she is given, and her horrible acting I found interest in her character. This fad of ass-kicking, take charge women seems to be continuing, and god damnit I love it!Milla Jovovich still isn't as attractive as she is made out to be (Well at least not in this film), and still not a very enthusiastic actress. Whenever she does a strenuous punch, or kick she gives off a little tennis player grunt (That little annoying: uh!), rather than an ""I'm kicking your ass"" scream (AHHHH) that I like from the woman who might soon be kicking my ass. But I'm sure she made her brother proud (For those of you who don't know, Milla has said in more than one interview that the main reason she wanted to play this part was to impress her brother.), kicking those zombies asses.I also gotta' ask how stupid can these people be. The guy sees this pale thing, limping along, blood dripping out of it's mouth, obviously not human, and he puts his gun up and says, ""Stop, I'll shot."" And continues saying this and that ""I mean it!"" that is said in all these types of movies, when it is obvious the character doesn't actually mean it. This zombie pretty much could have taken a bite out of his arm, and he just would have kept saying ""Don't move. I'll shot! I mean it!"" And the amount of time it took these people to realize these things are not human is incredible! Maybe they were supposed to look and act more human, but they went overboard on the makeup and overacted or whatever, but come on Milla, and Michelle! Your shooting at the thing, and he just stumbles. The thing ain't Superman babe, get a clue!Now you are all probably thinking, ""My god, he hated it!"" but I didn't! No, I was actually incredibly surprised at the entertainment factor of the film, and did, for the most part, enjoy it from start to finish. The bad dialogue made me laugh, the bad acting made me smile, and the stupidity of the characters made me yell at the screen. And I had a blast doing all of that. What did I particularly enjoy about the flick? Well for one the zombies. Very pretty, nice and bloody, and they didn't get any extras that were too bad (like the nurse zombie in Dawn of the Dead). The violence was also well done, not overdosing on the gore, and making it almost unwatchable, but putting in just enough to put a HUGE smile on my face when the characters I hated got killed.And I gotta talk about ""The Licker."" I loved it! Sure it looked extremely fake, but I thought Anderson did a smart thing by keeping it mostly off camera, and not showcasing his film's bad special effects like many other films do (Brotherhood of the Wolf comes to mind). But I also wish he would have put up a little bit more of a fight. The thing was huge, and he dies pretty quickly, and easily. And how about the highly entertaining death scenes. Woah, those were fun. Like I already mentioned the gore was nice, and that laser sequence was great.Thumbs up to Paul Anderson for his imaginative, and stylish direction. I know it would not have been the same with a different director (It would have been much worse, or much better). Even though I hated that stupid ""Red Queen,"" the POV shots were nice (But couldn't they have come up with a better name for that thing? I don't know if it was in the game or not, but Red Queen? It's a computer/camera for gods sake! How about ""The Computer."" Personally I don't want to live in the future if we name our computers ""The Red Queen."") The score was also a plus, getting me into the film even more. Very loud, very mean, and very nice. And the ending set up the sequel, and did a damn fine job in the process. I loved it!Overall, Resident Evil was a surprise. I expected it to suck, and although it TECHNICALLY did, there is no denying I loved it. Highly, highly, highly entertaining, gory, violent, and just all around fun. Check it out if you want fun, and some pretty bad performances. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A fair action-film, but a poor shadow of the game...","Relatively fun to watch, Resident Evil, is a decent enough action film. Hard to take seriously and lacking in atmosphere, suspense and any real depth is does not, however, do the games justice. The games are cinematic in quality and create an atmosphere and potential for adaptation into a truly great film. Why the venture was given to Anderson i will never know, adept at action, he appears to lack the depth of creativity and understanding that is needed to develop a truly good film. Resident Evil had the potential to be one of the scariest films ever made and instead it has been violated and torn apart until all that has been left of the masterful composition of the game is a few lousy references and a distant memory of an engaging story. It is as if someone has played the games, seen the cinematic potential, then thrown all that out the window, focusing on creating a self-involved 'cool' film that tries to hard, yet fails more often than succeeds. The replacement of the atmospheric music with the noise-like 'angst ridden metal' is laughable and becoming a touch clichéd. Whilst it has its moments, Resident Evil, does not live up to its name and frankly should have be made by someone with more respect for the games, their creators, their fans and film-making in general.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

not bad but I was hoping they would take a different route.,This movie was not that bad but I was just hoping they would kind of stick to the video game and make it more like a horror movie instead they took a different route and made it like an action movie which greatly disappointed me.This movie is about a special military unit who is sent to fight a super computer and hundrerds of scientists that have been infected with a disease that turns them into flesh eating monsters.This movie was pretty good it was surely entertaining enough. The acting could have been better and I would of like to see some elements of the video game in there but overall not bad.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Even low expectations weren't enough...,"to save this pile of rubbish.There is only *one* thing that can be said in favor of this movie: Surprisingly, for the first time in my memory, Milla Jovovich actually looks GOOD. In flicks like The Fifth Element, it never ceased to amaze me the lengths she would go to to make herself look hideous. In this, I didn't even know it was her until I saw the name in the credits here on IMDb. Yowsa. Yummy.Now, about the movie... It's worthless. The ""plot"" is weak, character development is half a step from non-existent, the premise is a rehash of dozens of old zombie movies mixed with the crazed supercomputer taken from dozens of other flicks, the acting is as you would expect from low budget B-Grade horror fare, and the scenery & effects are of the level that could be achieved in my basement with odds and ends I have lying around the house.This is what I will begin calling a ""Time-Machine Movie."" Meaning I wish I had a time machine to go back and recover the 2 hours of my life that I wasted on this schlock. It's too late for me, but you can save yourself from this impressive effort to lower the standards of mediocrity even farther than they already are.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolute screamer of a movie - major stand-out of its genre.....whatever THAT is?,"If movies are all about entertainment, this is one of the most successful films in history! The best action-fest I've come up against since ALIENS, to which it owes more than a nod!Absolutely the best video-game to movie transfer yet made. If it bears but a passing resemblance to the game itself, well who the hell cares? The simplistic plot is ideal for those with limited attention spans. The underground corporation-run sub-city experimental lab is thrown into disarray when a virus forces the ""Hive's"" CPU to shut down prematurely. A lot of people die most graphically. Another ALIENS type elite commando team (complete with an APONE look-alike) are sent in to ""rescue"" Milla Jovovich who for a while has no idea what the hell she is doing there, plus whomsoever they can rescue before they hope to kick-start the central computer who is playing some really innovative and rogue games with both the intruders and the audience.Mutant victims with more than a touch of the ""Living Dead"" cannibalise their rescuers one by one. Jovovich in easily her best role to date (are those the sexiest lips in screen history or what?) high kicks her oppressors and unbelievably well digitised Doberman reconstructs with flair and accuracy. There is simply no let-up throughout the movie which with the decibal screaming Dolby sound and rock-soundtrack just all dovetails together seamlessly.  State of the art FX enhance this adrenaline-pumping scifi caper and propel it into the stratosphere.As good a horror/sci-fi/zombie flick as you are ever likely to see with one all time mother of a jaw-snapping monster yet devised. Makes the Alien Queen look like a sedated kitten!This is one mad movie with a kick-ass direction and totally awesome action sequencing! Check out the dicing-death by laser-grid! This was mega-cool!

Review,"Resident Evil is a zombie themed action horror film series, inspired by the Japanese video game. The first Resident Evil film series was made in America in 2002.Zombies are one of my favorite spooky creatures. And I also like watching Zombie movies. I can say, if Resident Evil is the best Zombie Movie I have ever watched.Resident Evil story is quite exciting, spooky, and full of action. The main Female character looks beautiful and very strong. The Zombie design looks scary, especially the Boss zombie with a large and very intimidating body shape.A world infested with Zombies is a serious apocalypse. Where if we are infected just a little, then we can also turn into zombies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Computer Game Movies Always Turn Out Bad Except This One,"I have always said ""why can't any film studios make a good movie from a computer game"". Every computer game movie to come out I have always thought this is going to be the first good one, but each time I have been disapointed with the like of Street Fighter (I never thought this one looked good),Super Mario Brothers, Mortal Kombat, Final Fantasy and even Tomb Raider.I was really hoping that Resident Evil would be different, not just because I enjoy a good film but because I was a huge Resident Evil fan, and this time I was not disapointed.The movie was such a great ride with the main characters in the movie, like the game, having hidden secrets, which are not that hard to guess during the movie but are interested.The casting was great for this film as well with Milla Jokovich proven how to be a good tough lead for these types of films (take note Angelina Jolie).The start of the movie put you straight into the action before you could get a handful of popcorn with lift fulling, people drowning and other strange situations which seem to be a suspenceful as the game.Like the game I was always worried about want was going to happen next. There was also other scenes which were even more frightening especially the action in the sewers.The zombies were fantastic and very disturbing this was because they didn't just want to kill the people (like in most scary movies) they wanted to eat them  especially when they pulled a person into the lift and started eating him, it was not that pretty.Some bits of the movie was strange with some of the scenes starting with the group together and then suddenly Alice (Milla Jokovich) is walking down the corridor on her own and you are thinking ""why would somebody do that"", i know it happens in every horror film but its just stupid.Their was also no huge spiders (which are in the game) that I expected to jump out when they were in the sewers.I was a bit worried before watching this movie because it was made by Paul Anderson who directed Soldier and Event Horizon. But now after watching Resident Evil I am looking forward to Resident Evil 2: Nemeses.The ending to this movie was excellent as well because it makes you want to see the sequel as soon as possible, like the Fellowship of the Rings did.Final ReviewEverything about this movie made it a fun ride, the music,the licker and Zombies, the main characters (good or bad)and the final showdown that made you want to watch more, which say a lot.8/10I think Sarah Michelle Gellar could be great Jill Valentine for the next movie, because she has proven her self in Buffy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than Tomb Raider,"And the summary just about says it all.  What exactly about this movie makes it better than Tomb Raider?  EVERYTHING.1.  Action- good, violent, tense, without being too bloody. 2.  Characters- sure, they're two-dimensional at best, but Tomb Raider was one-dimensional at best. 3.  Plot- Tomb Raider didn't have one that made any sense; Resident Evil has a very methodical plot, with a few sharp, predictable twists that make it enjoyable popcorn flickage. 4.  Sequel set-up- never so blatant as in Resident Evil, but the movie still ends with a bang. 5.  Music- Okay, no U2 in this one, folks.  So maybe Tomb Raider wins one category.Not a very good horror film at all, but a great action film, which puts it directly at odds with the game series.  One good thing about the movie is that we finally find out exactly how the T-Virus got released.  This is a huge plus.  Another good thing is that none of the trademark characters from the games are involved directly, so the plot isn't fixed to their fates.Most of the CG work is grisly real, and totally unnoticeable.  The dialogue is sheer torture, and has no funny moments (I kept waiting for a vintage line like ""the master of unlocking,"" but none was forthcoming).  But the earnestness of the characters is sufficiently humorous that it leavens the deadpan seriousness of the film.  I rated this one a seven; I wish the music had been better, and the dialogue sucked.  But otherwise the execution is flawless.One thing: parents, leave the kids at home!  There were at least six kids under age 10 who saw this movie at the same time I did.  Without exception, they were crying at certain points of the movie.  This is just plain dumb. It's rated R for a reason.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"a dull disappointment, even for a videogame film","Despite good-enough performances from Jovovich, Rodriguez, and the rest of the cast, there is little more good to be said for this film, aside from some handsomely unhandsome zombies.  Did we need a cross between CUBE and Romero's zombie trilogy with an even more ridiculous version of ALIEN's anticorporate slant (when anticorporatism becomes as ridiculous as this, it certainly undercuts real anticorporatism)?  Nonsensical doubletalk, an idiot-plot from the beginning, and not even much in the way of interesting violence.  So, go to see Milla J be fetching and Michelle R be sardonic, but you can probably do that with some other films which might also entertain you.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sent a special mission a group of SAS like people must survive flesh eating zombies and creatures.,"Firstly let me say that I have not played the game R Evil. However I do know the story after countless hours watching my boyfriend play. As I am not a great fan of zombie movies I didn't expect to get much from this film. However to my surprise I really liked it.Yes the zombies still walk round at a snails pace and have the brain of goldfish, but the fact that crew are confined underground means that they simply can't just run away. Which is what I have always thought when I have watched other zombie films. To add to this you have the whole world off genetic engineering thrown in. So instead of just blood thirsty zombie's you also have the added bonus of some very nasty man made creature's.Therefore overall I would say that providing you are not expecting a carbon copy of the computer game, Resident Evil is an good choice if you enjoy the thrill of the creepy horror movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

But really,- when is the last time you went to the theatre to see a zombie flick? It brought back memories!This movie is NOT for the pre teen or younger set- a young mother chose to bring her little girl- probably 4 or 5 years old - and the child was very frightened. The R rating is appropriate and parents should be aware.The down note of the film is Michelle Rodreguiz's performance. She tried too hard to be tough- I found it annoying.

Well Worth Watching!,"Ok, Video games to films? Not very good admitted, Super Mario Bros attests to that. I am trying not to be biased as i am a massive fan of the video games. Unfortunately, this film was a very very good chance to make a top notch horror flick. It's a double edged sword however, if they rewrite(As they pretty much did) the storyline, it leaves it dissimilar to the VG's that me and quite a few others love! and if they dont rewrite it, it would obviously turn out to be predictable. Besides the disappointment of RE for that matter, it is a great watch, with some special effects to make the game ""come to life"" (the licker) and the film is ultimately cast above such terrible efforts as mario bros and StreetFighter. Milla Jovovich is worthy of a lead role, and looks damn fine as well! A hashed ""alien-style"" plot of the underground laboratory security system ""turning against them"" was kinda shocking but given the aforementioned VG to film efforts, it holds it head up high, though without unfortunately being able to scare the life outta me!any comments or questions on my comment will be answered if you want to email me.

Good movie,"My comments there isn't exactly SPOILLERS but you was advised.The basic plot-line is a great corporation has been developed a new virus and an ""accident"" occurs and the virus is free. The computer to avoid the virus spread, kill everyone in the base and there are only two survivors. A elite team is send to the installation and verify ""what a hell is going on"" and switch off the computer (because the computer kill everyone in the base of course). Well, the problems started because the computer dislike of the idea to be switch off, but this is only the beginning. The tone of the movie is Gothic and a little creepy and has a touch of ""matrix"". I explain, there is a sequence where the character of the Milla Jovovich kill some ""DOGS"" and a normal person NEVER does this things.These comments are enough to get a good idea of the movie, the actors works well, specially Milla, the special effects are very good. The some actions scenes are fast and brutal others has a creepy tone but are well worked. Ok, the script could be a little more elaborate but is good enough for this kind of movie. But there is an important thing, the end of movie is consistent with the basic background of the movie.In my opinion if you see this movie you will have a good time :).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
sign of the times for the ailing horror genre,"As a fan of both George Romero's films and the original video games I found this movie to be horrible. No, I don't expect every film based on a game (or a book) to be identical to the source material. What's wrong with this film is what's been wrong with movies (especially horror) for the last fifteen years. It caters to the short attention spanned. Quick and illogical cuts peppered with bad camera tricks took me right out of this movie. One minute someone is on the ground surrounded by undead, the next he is 'edited' up onto his feet and running for his life. HUH?I thought the 1940's and 1950's had it bad with Abbott and Costello running the Universal monsters into the ground. Hey, at least their films were INTENTIONALLY funny. Resident Evil isn't even UNintentionally funny. So, with no humor, that leaves horror to carry the film, which it doesn't. Why? Because like most films of the last 15 years, it's all quick cut action with no suspense. Creating tension takes time and consistency, something most modern film makers don't seem to understand. This film plays like a commercial or a music video without music.Once again, the characters are completely unsympathetic. They say dumb things and they do dumb things. Once again, the 'modern' tough, smart, strong, cool, sexy female stomps all over the proceedings with muddy feet. SHE BOUNCES OFF A WALL AND KARATE KICKS ZOMBIE DOGS! Oooh! I'm so scared. I'm just not sure what to be scared of! I suppose I'm scared of seeing an equally appalling sequel.If you haven't seen this film - DON'T. This is 90 minutes you can never have back. In the age of DVD, there's a wealth of good horror to be found. Better yet, Video games are fast becoming better than modern films.

"If you're a fan of the franchise, steer clear.","I went to the cinema having high expectations for the film. I was and still am a huge fan oft he games, especially Resi 2. I was expecting the characteristics of the game to be int he film; gore, suspense, violence, zombies and some nasty monsters. I was in for a huge disappointment...The film starts off OK, with some unknown figure unleashing the T-Virus but then it goes circling out of control. Whereas there are some elements still retained from the game(laboratory is under a mansion outside Racoon City and is owned by Umbrella Corporation it seems that the director got bored of transferring the franchise to film, and instead made the rest up. What follows is a mindless adventure as some elite soldiers go through the underground lab to try and stop the threat of the virus. Of course, there are zombies, but the overall look of then pales in comparison to Dawn Of The Dead (2004). Whereas some of them have gruesome wounds, 80% of them are just very pale and have makeup and fake blood. Along with that, there is no suspense. And what happens is that a zombie(s)will emerge, and along with tons of shooting, rock music appears.The big bad boy boss monster is the licker, who most Resi fans will know and appreciate as a med-i-okre monster, not too challenging. This thing however is made out to be the mother of all creations and is very disappointingly realised with bad CGI. There is no suspense here, a total lack of blood and gore, and only one monster. True fans of the Resi games will be and should be disappointed.That said, their are a few things which raise Resi from the dead (sorry for the pun). The ending climactic train set piece is enjoyable and fast paced, and the laser hallway (imagine, 3 soldiers, trapped in a hallway, with lasers that chop things in half) is pretty neat. There's also a cool appearance by some zombie Doberman dogs, however they're quickly killed off in a silly action scene.This film could have been so much more if the director would have ditched the possibility for ""cool stunts"" and gone for more style, suspense and horror. Even when the heroes are outnumbered and surrounded by zombies, you never feel as if they are in THAT much danger....when in a situation like that you should be on the edge of your seat.For zombie lovers, there are better choices out there. George A Romero's Dead films, the remake of Dawn of The Dead (04, Saun Of The Dead and even 28 Days Later serve up better chills and scares than this med-i-okre action fest.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better then I expected,"Having never played the game myself, I didn't quite know what the film would be like, but I quite enjoyed it. Milla Jovovich apart from being beautiful is now the holder of the Sigourney Weaver title of female bad guy ass kicker, and she dominates the sceen when ever she is on it as I couldn't take my eyes off her, and Michelle Rodriguez as the fiesty Rain was using her trade mark pout to maximum effect.On the negative side, the Zombies just were just not scary, and Ive seen better horror makeup in other films, one zombie I noticed was trying very hard not to laugh, and the sceen in the tunnel gave me the feeling the zombie gang, were all waiting off sceen ready for the director to say go before they all joined the shot.  The laser guard was good, and its special gory effects was good but the final laser victim of the traditional black man victim death was a waste of the best of the supporting characters, and was to brief to be really shocking, but this was understandable given the films British 15 certificate.  The zombie dogs though were good, and even gave me at 45 years old a start, and the way Milla took care of them, was in tune with the films source for action, well done Milla.As for the super baddie licker dog, it was all a bit fast in the train to get a real good look at it, but it gave off enough evil intent to be the best of the baddies.The ending sceen was really good, but before that who was the person walking across the screen before Milla escapes from the hospital, one of the crew? The final panoramic sceen sets the tone nicely for a sequel that I'll probably be going to see.Verdict, just enough gore, a reasonable adherance to the game play, and the lovely Milla Jovovich, showing lots of flesh and kicking zombie ass.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

This time the zombies, former technicians and scientists, are underground in a high-tech lab that secretly develops terrifying biochemical weapons of mass destruction.For those who care about the reasons for why things went crazy down there, suffice it to say there was a plot to steal a virus to prove what a horrible place it is - but one of the conspirators preferred to sell the virus to the highest bidder, while killing everyone else (or at least turning them into the Undead).

Those who see it will know what I mean; it was rather droll.Towards the end, Milla, wrapped in less than when she appeared in ""The Fifth Element"", faces an Apocalyptic Armageddon scene - the virus not having been contained.The cast is generically adequate, although Michelle Rodriguez as ""Rain Ocampo"" clearly ripped-off her tough-talking Hispanic female character on Private Vasquez in the great ""Aliens"" from 1986.Special effects are very good; the monster-thing being the highlight. Perhaps after all these movies I've become jaded, but I didn't think it was even all that gory. But that may be just me. There is absolutely nothing thought-provoking about this film, which is OK with me (although that was a failing with ""The Time Machine"").Anyway, it's a fun way to kill a few hours - entertaining and exciting. 7 out of 10.

Those who see it will know what I mean; it was rather droll.Towards the end, Milla, wrapped in less than when she appeared in ""The Fifth Element"", faces an Apocalyptic Armageddon scene - the virus not having been contained.The cast is generically adequate, although Michelle Rodriguez as ""Rain Ocampo"" clearly modeled her tough-talking Hispanic female character on Private Vasquez in the great ""Aliens"" from 1986.Special effects are very good; the monster-thing being the highlight. Perhaps after all these movies I've become jaded, but I didn't think it was even all that gory. But that may be just me. There is absolutely nothing thought-provoking about this film, which is OK with me (although that was a failing with ""The Time Machine"").Anyway, it's a fun way to kill a few hours - entertaining and exciting. 7 out of 10. I'm a little generous.Read the credit crawl at the end. Almost every name is German. It was filmed in Berlin.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil,"Okay, I do not play video games, being RavenGlamDVDCollector takes up too much time to fool around with other stuff as well, and my interests are 100% glamour-driven. Also, I originally, way back in 2007, had a multitude of choice, and decided to give RESIDENT EVIL and ULTRAVIOLET and BLOODRAYNE a miss, they'd be blood and gore fests, judging by the posters in the video store. Recently, I obtained UNDERWORLD's first three, and then there was the trailer of ULTRAVIOLET, which surprised me, I was hooked, that I had to see. Okay, I have since learned that people do not go for ULTRAVIOLET, that it is a rip-off, and, yeah, as good as that trailer is, it also became immediately clear to me that there is a lot of fakery, a lot of cartoonish stuff, I mean, look at the trailer, it's great, but cannot hide that there might be problems...... Tp cut a long story a bit shorter, I could only obtain ULTRAVIOLET as part of a two-disc deal, the other movie being RESIDENT EVIL, so, a couple of days ago, I watched the big gore fest. Ooh boy, it was only the week before that I saw THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE with those mandrill creatures attacking, and this week it was mutated Dobermanns on the rampage.I've been a fan of Milla Jovovich ever since she was a child star in TWO MOON JUNCTION way back in the previous century, yes, I am that old! Then, a few years later, she was in RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON, and that one sure had its moments. Time has treated her well, I see, quite a few years later, she is still this stunning long- legged beauty with this amazingly aquiline face. She is ultra-feminine, prime quality Ukranian export. The movie itself has a cumbersome slow start, but eventually the action is astounding, the producers had gone all out to provide the creepiest ugliness you can hope to find on film. It's just, I wouldn't really call it scary, it's not really suspenseful, it happens too blatantly in the open, it doesn't come unexpectedly, that's what I mean. But the mutated dog scene, that is something, when you hear that dog coming on, tip, tip, tip, claws on steel, and the first sight... hoo, horrible.I'd give them an A for effort, but I have to point out that the movie takes a very long time to establish itself. Once it gets going, it lifts off, but you can't shake the feeling that it could have been done a whole lot better. Certainly Milla Jovovich (hey, and the commentary finally taught me how to pronounce her name!) is the ideal choice. Really, that is the only thing I am sure about re this movie. Some of the male leads are kinda blah! but I'm not going into that right now. And Michelle Rodriguez is one tough ol' bird, hey?A weak point of this very violent movie is the unrealistic portrayal of dismemberment. A pinprick causes blood, people, you know that. So what does it mean when on-screen HUMAN characters, not undead characters, get chopped up, but not a drop of blood? Well, d-uh, it means the producers we're trying to appease the American Motion Picture Association by cutting down on what would have earned them a more stringent rating. But if a character doesn't bleed, it was undead too... Something everybody forgot. Major goof.In closing, this Milla Jovovich fan is quite satisfied. She's great, movie is not too bad, not as good as she is, though.Grrr-aarghhh!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

No! Shhhh! Quiet you whore teet of Hollywood suckling 'zombies'! THIS FILM IS AWFUL!,"Everything about this film is bad: performances were non-existent, design and photography tacky and tasteless, the special effects were poor (the 'licker' on the PS1 looked just as realistic as the one in the film), script shambolic (full of stereotypes, cliches and RIP OFFS - watch Aliens if you don't believe me) and direction unimaginative and lazy.Its just sad to read what people who liked this film have to say on this site - have these people never watched any decent films in their lives compare this rubbish to?! Do they only watch what Hollywood vomits into their cinemas or on their TVs?! To say that this is a good movie just shows plain ignorance of what it actually takes to make a 'good movie' - these ignorant troglodytes are killing cinema! AARRRGGGHHH!For all those left wanting for a better zombie horror movie (though RE hardly qualifies for this genre) try and dig out these juicy morsels: Plague of The Zombies (a Hammer Horror classic), Romero's Dawn Of The Dead or Danny Boyle's excellent 28 Days Later, and keep your eyes peeled for Shaun of The Dead which comes out this year. I'd also recommend playing the original game and its sequel on the PS1.I would recommend these films to those of you who actually liked Resident Evil, but perhaps your too far gone for the 'anti-virus' to have any effect.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not terrible, however the video games are more entertaining than this movie","Now this doesn't have almost nothing to do with the video games it tries to adapt with. Besides the evil corporation, the same virus and zombies, it does how ever have the survival horror feel to it and has sort of the similar atmosphere as the video games. Now this film is a mess for the most part, especially the last hour of it, but it's still a entertaining mess and the pacing is well done although it seems to skip a lot of parts and scenes. The story is passable, not great though alright for a video game adaptation and although not particularly scary it has decent action scenes and zombie killings. The plot is basically about a girl named Alice who worked for the Umbrella Corporation, who gets amnesia from a chemical and gets dragged in and has to team up with a group of commandos that is trying to infiltrate a underground lab called The Hive in order to turn off the super computer called the The Red Queen that killed off the workers after a virus outbreak. But the team is in for more than they bargained for. The acting in this is pretty bad, not terrible however. And although it isn't a fantastic film, it still is entertainment to some degree. Would have been better if it had some of the video game elements of solving puzzles with more flare to it and was compact better in a way it flowed better. Has a lot of flaws and nothing about it is scary in anyway, but still decent.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Started well, downhill from there","I had high hopes for this film. I had heard (from media hype, natch) that it might be the first decent videogame based movie ever. So I went to see it, and for the first five minutes hopes were high, the slow zoom in with the crunching industrial soundtrack was amazing, but it was downhill from there. Mila Jovovich finding herself in a strange place was intriguing, as was the lead up to her returning to the underground city (despite screamingly awful dialogue) and all seemed good. It was when the zombies appeared that this film disintegrated into awful cliche ridden vacuousness. After that, it was just an awful, suspence-free regurgitation of superior films and videogames. I do not want to spoil the plot for those who have not seen it, but when a zombie based movie does not use the word 'zombie' once, and takes an hour to realise the aforementioned undead should be shot in the head, something is really wrong!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
surprisingly good,"The only reason for me to see this movie was the mansion used as the secret entrance to the Hive. The original location happens to be next door to my home. I wasn't really expecting anything good from a video game conversion, but it was surprisingly entertaining and frightening, definitely worth the admittance. Though, the mechanisms used to shock the audience appeared a little off-the-shelf.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rating,"Considering the movie is from 2002 i can't really say anything bad about the CGI. The zombies was great, but the big bad monster in the end looked like ass, which is expected from a movie that was made in 2002. Probably good looking for it's time. Other than that i liked the story and the acting. The music also fit the movie perfectly. I liked the movie from the beginning to the end and i can't wait to watch the rest of the resident evil movies. A small minus for me because it didn't have any surprising scenarios and most of the things that happened was some what predictable. A solid 7 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun Video Game Horror Movie,"I like this movie a lot. In addition to being a solid horror movie, it is a very good video game movie. The effects are a little sketchy, but the acting and story are good.

Better than expected,"Seeing another movie coming from a video game background, and not a gamer at all, I was expecting another lame-o video game adaptation.  So my expectation wasn't very high.  I was surprised at how much better it was. The plot was pretty straight forward, get in, get the job done and get out. But in most aspects of it, it held me at the edge of my seat for much of the movie.Not that it was perfect.  The way the movie is laid out seem to follow a video game's strategy of conquering room by room, save the flashbacks, which slowly revealed the main characters' purpose.  The different level of laser slicer served no purpose except if you are at the joystick yourself (a mechanism in which these people, who knew the ins and outs of the system, didn't know about.)  We don't know how the sister was ever outside the compound.It seems to be a much better version of John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, which I found to be an absolute bore.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than I expected,"After reading some of the other comments on this movie, it appears that the voting comes down to this: either you thought it was awful, dumb, unoriginal, etc, or that the movie was actually better than expected.  I fall into the latter category.  I've never played the Resident Evil video games, so I really had no expectations for the movie.  I just thought it might be interesting to see if they could make Resident Evil, the movie, better than Final Fantasy, the Movie (which was pretty disappointing). And surprise - it was much better than I expected.  Somewhat predictable, but the action scenes were well done, the scares were pretty scary, and I didn't think the acting was bad at all.  The movie worked for me.  If you want some entertaining distraction for an evening, get a bag of popcorn and pop this movie into the DVD player - it's a fun movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Arrrrrrrrghh!,"Y'know, I've often said that movies are like music. There's no deciding whether something is bad or good, it's in the eye of the beholder. This mass of people saying that this movie is the best zombie movie ever though, I mean c'mon people! First off, the Evil Dead Trilogy is scarier than this film, and I just saw those 3 movies for the first time last week. Those films were't even supposed to be scary, and had really small budgets, but were 10 times more fun.In response to everyone saying you get to see Milla Jovovich naked...(Sarcasm begins now) OH WOW! I got to see half of Milla's nipple! OH MY GOD! The promised land does exist! Oh please God, just let me see a full nipple one day, and I promise I'll never sin again! (End Sarcasm) Anyway, if I want to see Milla naked, I'm sure she's posed for Playboy or something, and you saw more in the Fifth Element anyway. Plus she was younger and looked a lot better in that film.I hate Michelle Rodriguez. She's not hot in my opinion and she's played pretty much the same role in every movie she's been in. At least most actors who get typecast try to break away. Granted, they usually suck at whatever they try different, but that's not the point. Jim Carrey is a perfect example.By the way, was Milla's character ever mentioned by name in the movie? Or do we all know she was named Alice from this site and the credits. My friends and I could all swear we never heard her name or the black guy who looks like Laurence Fishburne's name. What a sucky script, we can't even get names for the people....Anyways, I think this film sucked, if you think it was cool, then go rent a real zombie movie, or at least find something that's not a Matrix wannabe ( Jump kicking Dog scene, bullet time licker scene)...",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Sci-Fi Action Horror Film,"In the near future, the powerful Umbrella Corporation has a hidden research facility called The Hive underneath Raccoon City, where the scientists develop genetically engineered drugs for medical purpose and biological weapons. After stealing the lethal T-virus, a thief contaminates The Hive and the artificial intelligence Red Queen seals the Hive and kills all the staff and guinea pigs. A woman called Alice (Milla Jovovich) awakes naked in a bathroom of a mansion without memory and soon a commando led by a man called One (Colin Salmon) subdues her and another man called Matt (Eric Mabius), who claims to be a cop. Alice learns that she is a security guard with her partner Spence (James Purefoy) assigned to protect the entrance to The Hive and her memory will return in an undefined period since she was affected by a gas. The Red Queen had a malfunctioning five hours ago and had shut down the facility and killed everybody releasing a lethal gas. Now they need to shut down the Red Queen and restart her systems. They use an underground train to reach The Hive and the Red Queen asks then to leave the place. However Kaplan (Martin Crewes) disables the Red Queen opening the doors in The Hive. Soon the group learns that the staff has turned into zombies and now they are under siege of the zombies. Most of the commando dies and only Alice, Spence, Matt, Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and Kaplan survive. Now they need to find a way to escape from The Hive since the system will shut down the exits in a short period. Who will survive?""Resident Evil"" is a great sci-fi action horror film by Paul W.S.

"Absolutely predictable scares, coupled with special effects","No spoilers here:Could the plot be anymore predictable? As soon as the sounds start to swell in this movie, you can count down the seconds until they scare you. You will sit around, placing bets in this movie about what will happen next, and how soon before the next zombie monster comes.Not to say the movie was a total washout. It's great for it's setting- a big, dark theater, with surround sound. The scares are well done- I fell for them every time, even though I knew what was going on. Questionable plot has generous amounts of cheese that will leave you going ""Did they REALLY do something that stupid?"" towards the end. I will say the movie is very good at faking you out with false alarms and then springing the expected scare about five false alarms later.The special effects were nicely done as well- anyone feel sorry for the dogs? The movie stays pretty true to the game, and feels like a giant video game thrown onscreen. Which it is, I suppose. Conspiracy plot presented in such a way that it's hard to grasp at the begining, but just smacks of ""We're going to make a sequel"" at the end.

"Resident Evil, Where?","Going into this movie I had high expectations on this film, being a fan of the game for which it was named. Now if you don't know the game this is a 'okay' if somewhat lackluster Zombie film, After all it's standard fair for a movie of it's type.My problems with it stems from the fact this movie has NOTHING to do with it's source material but name alone. It felt like it was written by someone that didn't even read the crib sheets for the Resident Evil Game but ONLY skimmed them(briefly).That is my biggest complaint, it seems standard fair these days in Hollywood to slap on a name recognition titles on to movies with little to do with the source material. That's my complaint to the point, if this film had been more faithful to it's title (No Tyrant, Mansion, Jill, Chris or ANY characters from the game used or referenced to in the slightest.)I might have enjoyed it more.But as it stands it's at best a sub par overrated zombie film with a misplaced title.

Well...I liked it,"I've got to write something to at least slightly counter the bad vibes people are putting out about this film.No it's not the scariest film ever made, I'll give that, and maybe it's not like the game, but who gives a shit.  But the production values are great, the acting is good.  Milla and Michelle kick arse, look good doing it and they can act.  It's a pity the only strong male character, the squad leader (name?) got sliced and diced.  Oh and the CGI isn't top of the line, but who gives a rats, seeing the strings in Blakes 7, Dr who, Thunderbirds or the matte lines in the Star Wars never stopped anyone except the anal from enjoying them.

"Umbrella Inc. ""Bringing comfort into your home""","Does anyone else see the relation of Umbrella and Enron, although Umbrella's deception turnouts to be a little more deadly?  For those of you that are confused I am talking about the major corporation that does play a pivotal role in the plot of this movie(contrary to critical and cynical belief a plot does exist).My advice towards the other reviews that you are reading too is to be wary of any extreme take on this movie. Some people gave it a 1 out of 10 and that is not realistic because they were p***ed off by something in the movie thus shredding to part the entire film with fabrications and unbelievable exaggerations that actually made me laugh.  On the other hand be wary of someone who gives it a 10 out of 10 because they might be one of those crazed, lunatic biased fans that jumps at the sound of an unexpected groan.Although I have to admit that I am a biased fan of the game and I did go into this movie extremely pumped, I also had expectations for the film to live up to.  And just being able to say that I like a film that I have expectations for, much less being sucked into says a lot. Now enough of this BS credibility stuff let me tell you about an a thriller of an action/horror movie.  The first thing that jumps to mind when I think about Resident Evil- beginning, middle and end- is the atmosphere.  There was just something about the movies extremely fast pace, tense feeling and genuine dread that made me connect to the picture.  Granted I do have my ""I wish"" 's about the film too but like the others said, its a horror flick you let them slide and keep an open mind so that you are able to enjoy the rewarding aspects of the film, which are fresh, unexpected and plentiful.Milla makes me think that there are few things more sexy than a woman with a gun.  She is stunning throughout the picture and honestly feels like the only character developed by the way she plays her role outside of the dialogue and story development.  As Alfred Hitchcock once said (not in his exact words) ""a really good actor saves you 20 minutes of character development because the audience buys into the character"" and Milla does this.  You really get a good feel for who her character is by just watching her and she is the one person that I got attached to.  Now if we could have only gotten a little more out of the other characters in terms of story development.  I also felt that Hugh Jackman could have fit perfectly as the prisoner in this movie, but it did have a small budget.  The movie is also unique in its pace as it never slows down and you honestly cannot look away for a second for fear of missing something critical, which you might.  I have never ever seen a picture move faster.  This again adds to the atmosphere of the movie that I felt comparable to Memento or the Matrix. If you know the feel of those movies then you know what I am talking about.The action choreography is very good and better than most movies and there are even some scenes that will leave you saying ""awesome"" and ""glad I wasnt that zombie getting my neck snapped.""  I felt that the special forces as protaginists with guns gave the movie more validity and realism, as well as staying true to the game.  Of course there are also some great sequences with the hardware which also left me impressed.  I am anticipating the DVD of this movie already because I would love to see if there is a directors cut of that gives us a little more in character development and in turn would add to the story.  The thought of this however might take away from the razor fast pace, which creates the critical and unique atmosphere that Resident Evil video gamers definitely are familiar with.  Overall I would give this movie 9 out of 10 as I am rating it based on what it is.  A movie that is well above par from your average horror flick bringing in a realistically scary storyline and solid plot that aside from a little more development and omission of a few cheesy scenes and one liners could be one of the classic horror movies of all time.  This film will not disappoint the gamers either and fans of Milla, as I am now one of them after watching this movie, will respect her performance.  She is the standout in this film. Also look for the things that make the horror picture a different type of scary movie.  Director Paul Anderson uses the element of terror to scare the sh*t out of you and that is rare in a scary movie and I find it more terrifying. Moreover the original concept and conscious effort to avoid cliches left a refreshing taste in my mouth, but an extremely paranoid and skittish mind waiting for a zombie to reach from the back seat of my car on the ride home and take a chunk out of my neck.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great, gory zombie flic, just don't take the wife","I really enjoyed Resident Evil for several reasons.  It is set in a very hi-tech underground lab with lots of dark moody lighting to set the mood for the evil to follow.  Without giving too much away of the story line I loved the methodical destruction of the team. Milla Jovovich was very believable as the heroine/zombie killer and even though it's a bit sparse in the plot department it chugs along at a fair pace, with the fright factor very high.The thing that impressed me the most was the special effects and prosthetics used. The fight scenes were particularly believable and the zombiefication of the humans was excellent (but look out for the doberman's with the metal teeth and no hair - way cool!)Just a word of warning though, this is NOT a date movie or even something to watch with your wife.

Zombie-Bashing at its best,"I was lucky enough to see Resident Evil in a Sneak Preview in Vienna, Austria. As usual for the horror genre the movie is rather short (around 90mins) but not a second of it is boring.The movie starts off with a virus being released in an underground research center called ""the Hive"". The A.I. closes all exits and kills everyone inside to keep the virus contained. When our main character (Milla Jovovich) awakes in the shower, she has no memory of who she is. A group of soldiers takes her along to the Hive that is located under the building she woke up. They don't tell her much, only that she was supposed to protect the entrance. Everyone who knows the computer game knows what follows: tons of zombies.The story evolves rather nicely since we never really know more than the main character. The suspense added by this to the known genre plot of ""get out before they kill you"" is a nice little extra. There is nothing to complain about the special effects and the action is well executed though obviously inspired by the Matrix in some places. The music is effective, loud and fits the movie.I really enjoyed it and I think that fans of movies like ""Pitch Black"" or ""The Relic"" will enjoy it too. Splatter-fans might be somewhat disappointed, the gore factor isn't higher than in any of the movies mentioned above. Fans of the video games will notice nice little tidbits taken from the games and even if I played only part of one of them, I liked the attention to the details (for example the sound that the zombies make, the equipment used, the enemies encountered and most importantly: the end). I can only recommend this movie to fans of the genre and to everyone who played one of the games.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

An Opinion from a  Resident Evil Game Fan,"i voted this movie a 1 because it was the worst game to movie, movie i have ever seen. it doesn't even follow the plot from the game. when does Alice come into play? i mean I'm just wondering if Paul Anderson even knew what the game about. being a hardcore Resident Evil fan i could name everything wrong with this movie but i don't have all the time in the world to do so. it would have been a good movie it if it wasn't based of this particular game and it had the title changed. this director/screenplay writer is know for bad movies so if your going to watch this movie be prepared to be bored out of your mind. he could have at least went with the video game plot because it was already a good story and he didn't have to ruin it. he made resident evil look so bad with this movie. the zombies didn't even look like zombies. basically it was a bad script, bad actors and bad director. and if u haven't played the game and u watch this movie, don't think its a bad game cause this movie really made resident evil look bad. this is just an opinion from a Resident Evil game fan.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great Zombie movie,"This is a fast paced, high-tech, high-action, horror film that keeps you entertained from beginning to end.  There have been other attempts at bringing video games to the big screen that had miserable results.  Of course, we all remember the ill-fated Mario Brothers movie.  MORTAL KOMBAT was probably the biggest let down.  TOMB RAIDER was not as bad, but still failed to really ""wow"" audiences.  So far, I would say RESIDENT EVIL is the best video-game-gone-big-screen so far.The plot outline is pretty simple:  A team of commandos venture in to a secret corporate research base to discover what went wrong and why all the employees were killed off.  They find out that horrible experiments were taking place and a biological terror is released in the form of vicious, flesh-eating zombies.  They have to find the antidote and get out before they are sealed inside forever.The film moves fast.  There are a lot of scares, some of which are set up with fast editing, but the film pulls it off effectively.  The gore abounds and is VERY well done.  Some of the disfigurements of the zombies was done with CGI to great effect.  There is one zombie that is missing a large portion of his head, which pretty much looks like swiss cheese, and that effect is both startling and grotesque.  I loved!  And if Zombies are not enough for you, there are also zombie dobermans.  And if that doesn't give you nightmares, there is a big, Frankenstien/Alien-from-hell monster that breaks loose from its incubation chamber that probably will give you nightmares.Besides the great effects, there are a lot of cool scenes throughout the movie.  The highlight of which is probably the part where the commandos are sliced up with a laser beam.  Also, the gore effects here are fantastic. (The end of the guy's knife getting sliced off and falling on the floor was a nice touch!)  In fact, this movie is a lot gorier than I anticipated it would be.  It is much more gore-infested than most movies that have been coming out in recent years.  So that is a breath of fresh air to a horror fan like me.In some ways, the movie amounts to a very well done ""B"" horror flick.  If you are like me, you will love that kind of stuff.  Although this is not a perfect movie, the second act is long and well developed.  By this I refer to the characters getting further and further in to trouble.  The situation gets worse, and then, just when you think the situation could not get any worse, it gets WORSE still!  Which creates some good suspense and great action scenes which build up to a fantastic third act with an exciting final battle on the train.  Without giving anything away, I will just say that the conclusion was really well done.  I really liked the ending, not only because it was creepy and the final special effect was really grandiose, but because we get to see Milla Jovovich's muffin...who could ask for anything better?  She certainly doesn't seem to have a problem getting naked, which is a good thing.  Made me reminisce of the good old horror movies of the early 80's.Only two minor complaints.  The part where Milla starts breaking everybody's neck, I didn't really buy that.  The human neck doesn't break so easily. Although, dying with Milla's thighs wrapped around my neck sounds like a pretty nice way to go.  And sometimes the characters get in to deep trouble and then the movie doesn't really explain how they got out of that trouble. This doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film, however.If you liked ALIENS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (my all time favorite horror/zombie movie) then you will like RESIDENT EVIL.  Don't make the mistake of thinking this is another bummer of a video game/movie.  It is an effective horror movie all on it's own.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Video game movies are tough...,"almost just like comic book movies. Everyone has their own interpretation of what they think the movie should be like and what they really like about the games differs too. The things I like about this movie is Milla, zombies, and guns. The things I don't like about this movie is the story could have been better. The screenplay could have been better. And especially the Lickers, they should have been better. I'm really not really a big Licker fan, I would have rather have seen Hunters instead. Either way, the lickers were a little weak, but they definitely made an effort to improve the Lickers in the sequel. I really don't like zombie dogs. You mean a zombie man cannot run, but a dog can? Makes no sense. I understand this movie was also made to set the stage for other future movies and sometimes I hate that. I love for each movie to tell its own story without having to worry about leaving something for later. The scene with the laser security system was cool, reminded me of the cool scene in Ghost Ship. This movie is okay to watch from time to time, but its really something that I wont watch more than once every few months. I love zombie movies but I have others that are better than this. I'm only half way through the second RE, but once I am done, I will post my feelings on this too.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just A Video Game Movie,"A movie banking on the popularity of the hit video game series. Entertaining, but the plot sucks. No originality. Just hack and shoot. Just zombie after zombie.

Great Zombie Flick!,"I have some mixed reviews about this movie.  I will detail the good points first and then point out a few flaws or holes in the plot that can make or break your opinion.Good Points:Music, action, zombies, blood, shooting, guns, some flesh flashing are all good points.Action, shooting, guns and blood can all be categorized together.  One compliments the other and it was all well put together.Zombies were fantastic, with their heart stopping surprise thriller moments, great makeup and pretty good but not spectacular computer animated effects. They made me think of the old great Night of the Living dead movies, but the actors that portrayed them were better.Music was fantastic, the score was great for this movie and I was well pumped up for all the action scenes.Flesh Flashing.. well being a guy.. let's just leave it at that..Bad Points:Not many, while the music and score were great, it was a little too loud at a few points.  The acting wasn't spectacular but adequate for a zombie flick.. just think back to Night of the Living Dead and remember how bad the acting was for those movies.Lastly, the major plot hole I noticed.  The movie shows that one of the blue vials were broken in the lab, the lab then sealed and locked.  Allright that's fine, but what I find disturbing, and this is after having worked in a level 5 capable lab environment, is that the virus could become airborne through the ventilation system.  Technically.. impossible.  There are so many filters and security measures in virus labs that it would be completely impossible for that virus to go airborne.  Even if the hive computer wanted it to.  You just can't turn off a filter.If you think about that, then there is no movie, they should have thought of another way to spread the virus, say.. through a plague of rats they were testing on or use the method that was used in 12 Monkeys.Overall: Great movie and a must see for video game fans or not.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining Zombie Flick,"Resident Evil is one of the few films based on a video game that, as a whole, didn't disappoint me. As far as I am concerned, it was a very good video game-based movie, and an entertaining zombie flick. Let me break it down.Story: Alice, a woman with no memory, is brought into a world she doesn't understand when a team of paramilitary commandos take her down into a research lab to aid them. Apparently, the entire lab was wiped out by the area's supercomputer, entitled ""Red Queen."" Their mission is to wipe out the supercomputer, and determine the cause of why everyone was killed. The trouble is, a deadly virus was released through the facility, and the people that were killed are still walking around. Resident Evil is a film about conspiracy and scientific experiments gone horribly wrong.Direction: Paul W.S. Anderson, in my opinion, is a fine director. He knows exactly what he wants to achieve in each film, and sets out to do it. Anderson knows how to build up the audience, and submerse them into a film. The pacing of the film is terrific, with just the right blend of action and horror. Anderson can work wonders with a budget, and knows how to set up the mood for the entire picture, and keep it that way. Solid! Rock on, Mr. Anderson.Acting: This was the part where the film faltered. While not horrible, the acting isn't top par, either. Milla Jovovich(Alice) played the part of the amnesiac quite well. She was definitely the finest actor in the film. The girl has talent. Michelle Rodriguez(Rain) played her usual tomboy no-nonsense character almost as good as usual, though something was missing in this performance. Eric Mabius(Matt) did a poor job. His performance was just not believable to me. James Purefoy(Spence) is a gifted actor, and I look forward to seeing him more often. As for the rest of the cast, some were good, some were poor, and some just plain sucked.Score: Marilyn Manson and Marco Beltrami composed a fantastic score for the film. Their combined efforts really helped set the tone for the entire movie, and fit in so well with what was going on. I loved it.Violence: Unlike most zombie flicks, this film is not extremely gory or revolting. The zombies shed very little blood, because, as stated in the film, it has already coagulated. Still, there are a few bloody bits. We get countless head shots, gunshot wounds, decayed zombies, some creature violence, and a particularly nasty segment with a laser.Profanity/Sexual Themes: Of course, cussing is found in this film, though I must say, it is almost always justifiable in the flick. As far as sexual themes, there are two very brief sex scenes between Milla Jovovich and James Purefoy, with a brief glimpse of nudity on Milla's end.Substance Abuse: None.Overall: By the end of the movie, I found myself thoroughly entertained. Resident Evil is a good video game adaption, and a pretty entertaining zombie flick with the perfect blend of scares and action. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bores-ville for all game lovers,"This movie is sapossed to be about the game. One thing is, is the zombies were a whole lot scarier in the game then they were on the ""silver screen."" The ""licker"" didn't arrive in the game until the second one, but they sure did leave out the big guy that JILL was to fight, the Tyrent . . . Does anyone remember him? I sure do. Where were S.T.A.R.S. Alpha and Bravo Team? Where was Jill, Berry, Chris, Wesker, Brad, Kenneth, Enrico, Rebecca, and Richard? And where was all of the weapons? It wasn't Racoon City, that doesn't come up until the second and the third one, it is set in Racoon Forest. I would think that if George A. Romero (Dawn of the Dead) did the movie it would would have been a lot better. At least when they did Tomb Raider it stayed with the game. I'm sorry, if your going to take something and redo it, do it right!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"No, no, no, no!","For anyone who has played throught the videogames in the series (especially the GameCube remakes) will know that it was the immense tension, slow build up, film noir-like lighting and the gritty characterisations that made the zombie action so brilliantly scary.However, it seems that Paul 'Mortal Kombat' WS Anderson spent his time watching Kerrang! on cable in the run up to over seeing the design of the film.  Resident Evil, although catering mainly for the 'teen - rockers' faternity could also have appealed to a broader horror fan, or even been a more mainstream sucess (in the same way that 'The Others' was 'Poltergeist' for thesps).The entire thing plays like a two hour rock video.  Why is the installation so clean and new?  It was housed in  a rotting mansion in the games (with its decrepid grounds and gothic architecture) and merely placing a mansion in the film does not a plot point make.The zombies had CGI eczema and the amount of cast was OTT - why not have a few specific deaths instead of popcorn cannon fodder?  The music was terrible - just because it is horror and was made in the new millenium we had to put up with thrash metal. Hmmm.Paul's sequel will be just as crap, im sure.  God, I hated this film, as I'm sure you can tell - and you will too if you're a fan of serious and genuinely frightening horror.  This is just a media franchise film I'm afraid, and very unsatisfying.I gave it a 4 just because it had a vague resemblance to the game, but the potential that the game held, cinematically, has been devoured by this actually very poor film.This style was great in 'Mortal Kombat' - it was a good, fun, meaningless film (like the game) but in the case of 'Resident Evil', a narrative that holds deep emotioal and social meaning (and is subtly scary) it is as useful as a spoon.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wow, pretty good!","I have to admit that I expected to see a movie geared towards a teen crowd not looking to watch a film, but just to see action. While this isn't the most cerebral out there, it's more than I thought it would be.The bad: Well, at times the action does get tedious and convenient. For example, there's a scene where they get trapped in a room. A laser shines down the room at head level. Then it shines again at head level. Then it shines yet again, but this time forming a criss-cross pattern. Now, this laser is a defense mechanism, so why go for the criss-cross pattern right at the beginning? Why mess around? Things like that and some of the dumber, repetitive action scenes can get annoying.The good: I like movies which throw you into a situation where you are in the dark, and that's where this starts off. From a science lab, we see someone break a vial and leave the lab. From there, it switches to a woman in a mansion. No one knows what's going on (including her), and draws in those people wondering what went on (like me). The story is laid out where you don't feel manipulated and there are enough turns in it that you don't get the feeling that you know what's really going to happen. I also have to admit being surprised about the ending, but I liked it. The acting is what you'd expect, and the score fits well with the scenes.Having not played the game, I can't say how well it takes from the game, but I can say that the movie is accessible for someone who hasn't played the game, and it's worthy of a rental.Bottom Line: It's a good action movie to watch on a Friday night with friends. 7/10-Mark",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant zombie film!,"I am a fan of the Resident evil games and i must say that this film is absolutely brilliant! It's a great kick ass movie that takes it's time getting to the good bits and then the action never lets up. This is one of my favourite zombie films and i watch it over and over again! It's definately up there with the top zombie films i.e. Zombie: Flesh Eaters and Dawn of the dead.The music in this film adds to the enjoyment and Paul Anderson should give himself a pat on the back as this is great film making. Yer maybe it doesn't follow the story of the game but if your a fan of zombie films ignore the game and enjoy yourselves and the ending  should please all you resident evil game fans out there(it sure as hell pleased me and made me beg for the sequel to be here soon!)The film has it's game related stuff i.e. the dogs and the licker which i enjoyed watching them come to life on the big screen.

You're all going to die down here.,"I am sure that this would have been a much better film had George Romero (Night of the Living Dead) signed on, but I don't take anything away from Paul W.S.

A pleasant surprise!,"Yeah, I've read the other reviews and I agree...Super Mario Bros, Double Dragon, Street Fighter...any movie that is based on a video game has killed itself before it's even been released.  I am a big fan of the RE games, but honestly was not too thrilled to see this when it came out in theaters b\c of the above facts.  To me, there was no way that anyone could come close to translating that game into a good movie.  So, when this hit the video stores, it was 'the hot' dvd for the time being, so I indulged myself and bought it for the heck of it.  Man, was I pleasantly surprised!First off, I agree with 99% of the other negative reviews on what was negative about this movie...wooden characters, little to no character development, cheesy CGI at the end, etc.  But despite these annoyances, I couldn't help but admire this movie.  I mean, this movie defines how atmosphere should play a huge role in any movie.  The Hive is filmed as a dark and spooky place, grim and bleak from the sudden loss of life of the Umbrella employees.  Paul Anderson once again, like in Event Horizon, concentrated all of his efforts on atmosphere and direction and it shows. Like the story, this movie really makes everything feel like a dream, like you've just woken up from a strange dream into a weird type of Alice in Wonderland nightmare.  Marilyn Manson did an excellent job with the score, it is appropriately creepy and gives a feeling of both naivety and desperation.As for scares, there are a few, but the surprises far outweigh the frights which is actually good in this case.  I liked how everything was going on in the beginning and you really don't know what's going on until 30 minutes into it, and Milla Jovovich finally asks what we're all wanting to know. This is just not a conventional action/horror flick at all.  It offers a big factor of unpredictability, and not just cheap plot twists that make no sense, but instead, real human reactions if this were really to happen in real life.  Though the characters were underdeveloped, their expressions fit their roles.  Milla looks incredibly hot, especially at the beginning and the end.  She always has this innocent look on her face like she knows something noone else does that totally goes with the movie.  Michelle Rodriguez, though cliched (I think this badass woman thing started with James Cameron's masterpiece, Aliens) really convinced me that her character, Rain, was truly a take no prisoners, show no fear, take no crap soldier especially when she's fighting.  Both women make the movie, period.  The others, well, are just there as zombie fodder, though a lot of the deaths were totally unexpected (not so much who would survive, but when said people would buy the farm).  With this in mind though, I will agree with some other reviewers that there weren't enough zombie deaths, nor gunfights (if you think about it, these commandos really did not bring very much ammunition, nor did they think about picking up their fallen camarades' gear) for a zombie flick, but like I said earlier, this one is very untraditional.This movie really stays true to the game, which is as unpredictable as they come.  Anderson even pays homeage to it by using some of the same camera angles (die hard fans will love them).  And the scene with the attack dogs was refreshing since it was done without CGI.  The direction is solid. Enough said.All in all this is a good movie.  It has a great beginning (that will give you chills down your spine) that literally keeps you glued to the screen, and a slightly weaker second half that delivers as well.   Milla and the atmosphere alone are worth the price of viewing.  This is one of the better horror films to come out in the last ten years.  I give it a solid 8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some good action but not much more,"The Umbrella corporation dominates the world. In an accident at its secret underground facility called ""The Hive"", a dangerous virus is let loose.

First and the best rendition based on popular video games in which a  virus has escaped into a secret facility,"A special military unit fights a powerful, out-of-control supercomputer and hundreds of scientists who have mutated into flesh-eating creatures after a laboratory accident into a facility called the ¨Hive¨. But a secret experiment has been developed and a fatal mistake and a deadly virus expands itself .

The group Milla Jovovich , Eric Mabius , Colin Salmon , Martin Crewes , James Purefoy) battles the Umbrella Corporation , the undead and a super computer that plots total destruction over the human race . The commando (to prepare for their roles, the actors playing commandos and Milla Jovovich and Eric Mabius had a week of commando training with a Navy Seal) in the heart of Umbrella's most clandestine operations facility and unveil mysterious plans .First original film with nonstop action , violent combats and spectacular images by computer generator . The human race's last and only hope is Alice (Milla Jovovich is the only actor to appear in all five films) . Spectacular , action-packed and thrilling first installment of the ¨Resident Evil series¨ , adapted from the video games characters produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi . Yet another noisy film rendered from a video game which never gets as eerie as a Zombie picture should . Unstopped-action gore-feast that provides for high-octane escapist entertainment with some eye-catching visuals and pulsing soundtrack . This exciting picture contains thrills , chills , action-filled with fierce combats and lots of gore and guts . The horror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized , being the first movie of the series not to feature undead dogs . This original takes more , more approach , more fights , more blood and gore than subsequent sequels . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with scary and amazing frames . It's predictable but we have seen some scenes in previous films , but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting from the action-women , as Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez . Milla Jovovich did all of her own stunts except the pipe jump in the sewer scene . The main actors were told to prepare for the film by getting copies of the games and playing them through. Some of them didn't know if they could complete them in time so they had to get video copies of other people beating the games and then watch it . One of the most popular scenes in the film - when Alice runs up a wall and flings round to kick a zombie dog in the head - took 3 months of training for Milla Jovovich. The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods , plenty of screams , shocks and tension . The make-up assistants create a truly horrible zombie cannibals and state-of-art FX won the Canadian Screen Award for Achievement in Visual Effects . Professional dancers were cast as zombies . Horrifying and astonishing images about apocalyptic events with destroyed city , with a technological facility totally inhabited by flesh-munchies creatures and much of it was filmed in unfinished stations of Berlin underground . Cool , luminous cinematography using Steadicam by David Johnson . Haunting , pulsing Techno-musical score by Marco Beltrani . The motion picture was professionally directed with startling visual style , though with no originality , by Paul W Anderson . This was he second movie based on a video game directed by Paul W.S. Anderson , the first was Mortal Kombat (1995). Its successful opening weekend sparked a frenzy among US studios, eager to capitalize on the interest in video games. Titles like Doom (1993), Silent Hill (1999) and Max Payne (2001) were all snapped up.The complete saga is formed by the following films : ¨Resident evil¨ by Paul W Anderson with Milla , Eric Mabius , Michelle Rodriguez , James Purefoy , Colin Salmon ; this is the best , dealing with a group of containment specialists are sent in and have to fight employees who have been contaminated , while A.I. computer instigates a series of defensive measures to contain the virus . It's followed by ¨Resident evil II : Apocalypse¨ by Alexander Witt with Jared Harris , Iain Glen , Oded Fehr , Sienna Guillory . Furthermore , ¨Resident evil III¨ by Russell Mulcahy with Ali Larter, Ashanti , Mike Epps , Oded Fehr and of course Milla Jovovich ; ¨Resident Evil : Afterlife¨ by Paul W Anderson with usual actors along with Kim Coates , Sergio Peris Mencheta , Boris Kodjoe and Wentworth Miller , and ¨Resident evil 5 : retribution¨ with Boris Kodjoe, Johann Urb ,Aryana Engineer , Kevin Durand , Robin Kasyanov and as always Milla Jovovich .",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Painful to watch,"Many reviewers consider this to be one the best adaptations of a video game into a film...Well, I have to disagree, mostly because I love all the Resident Evil games, and even when this is much better than things such as ""Doom"" or ""Bloodrayne"", it is just doesn't make any justice to the original games in which this movie is inspired.This film betrays the original roots of the game, focusing in the action rather than the horror parts (Sure: The games had lots of action, but also had lots of thrills, mystery and subtlety, something that this film completely lacks) The other problem with this film is the terrible direction of Paul W.S. Anderson, which ruins a great story, turning the whole thing into a huge mess that is barely watchable. As a movie independent of the games, it is mediocre at best. But as an adaptation it is just terrible, dreadful film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
I thought it rocked,"I thought there were some very effective scary scenes in this movie! like when the power went down and the doors opened up releasing the zombies. you dont see them, you just see the a slight movement of shadows on the wall near the open doors, the part where that guy was listening intently at the air vent up in the ceiling and he could hear the moaning and screaming from the zombies way in the distance....creepy.   ok, the dog scene should have been deleted. it was really hokey. I thought the zombies looked scary as hell. I was also really touched by that hot woman in the movie. she really seemed to care about the others around her, whereas in most other monster movies its everyone for themselves.that special forces latino woman was getting on my nerves. I mean they all knew what they were getting into, they I am sure had some data that a deadly virus was involved, yet she walks right up to obviously infected zombies and gets bitten! come on! also,the guy at the end who got scratched, instead of saying COME ON! give me that cure for the virus shot he and she start babbling wasting precious time.

A Must-See For Milla Fans!,"I can't believe that an actress who's been working for so long is still only 29 years old! She ages with supreme grace, and has *never* looked better than she does in Resident Evil. Wow!The movie itself is fair. Not great, not terrible. Pretty good SFX. It's a techno zombie thriller, and for what it is, it's effective enough. Considering how bad movies based on computer games usually are, this one is pretty good, although it has problems getting started. There are a few scenes that don't make sense (and that cop - Matthew? - where does he really come from?), and it's never really clear that there's only one of the CGI mutating zombie animals loose. The technobabble explanation we get for the zombies is a worthy attempt to ""technofy"" the zombie genre, but it doesn't quite work, esp. not the part about the ""need to feed"". All in all the movie brings back memories of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, and I'm sure the sequel will, too.Milla Jovovich gives good face. She doesn't really have anything to do for the first 45 minutes (other than look beautiful, of course), but she's very cool when she starts pouring on the kicks and punches, and her character is likable and heroic (and did I mention good-looking? And that outfit she's wearing...!). One wants to see more of her. With some better writing, this sort of role would be perfect for her. Accessible, kick-ass adventure with an appealing female lead (or several). If movie-makers know what's good for them, this is the kind of thing they should do more of. Much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly enjoyable,"This movie has guilty pleasure written all over it: it has no character development, little revealed plot (it's like an installment of the games - you're never sure all of what has happened or that will happen in the future), and, ultimately, no point, but - unless you're adamantly opposed to either zombie or video game movies - it's hard to deny how creepy and fun this film truly is. ""Resident Evil"" has more than its fair share of genuine frights, some nice effects, and very few instances of incredulity when it comes to keeping certain characters alive - something that's plagued more than a few thrillers recently (MI2, Gladiator, to name a few). Yes, the suspense in this film is actual suspense, i.e. in every scene there is the chance that the main characters could actually lose. The movie plays out very much like one of the games, which was enough for me to enjoy it.That said, the movie has its flaws. People needing something deeper than close calls, gore, and death to enjoy the film will be let down. And there was certainly opportunity for the film to be more than just another installment of the game. There was definitely room for character development, which may not have seemed necessary for game purists (because, naturally, in the game you assume the main character's identity and can identify with their horror in that manner), but usually it is for movies. There is little room for personal attachment to the characters in the film, which is a small let down, good as some of the frights are. The movie also could have initiated us more in the workings of the Umbrella Corporation. There's a strong anti-corporation message under all this gore, but it never gets fully realized.Still, an overall enjoyable film. The laserbeam scene will go down in film history. Not for the squeamish.Matty J 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Highly entertaining, an intense action-thriller","For die-hard fans of the original 'Resident Evil' video game series, this film may come as a disappointment, as the general horror and darkness that made the games so unnerving has been ditched here, in lieu of an intense action-thriller. Nonetheless, in its own right, this film is highly entertaining.Milla Jovovich puts in a superb performance as Alice, who is lead into an underground base of a multi-national corporation to do battle with a series of ghoulies and monsters, including a horde of the undead. With terrific co-star Michelle Rodriguez, there is never a dull moment, moving at a furious pace with just the right mix of dry humour, mystery that surrounds the ""Umbrella Corporation"" and its motives, and impressive action sequences featuring an agile Jovovich in the dress she's barely wearing performing some remarkable stunts.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Guts and...,"Over one year passed since I first heard that the movie was being made and I've been waiting for it since then. Time passed once again after it was premiered, but I still didn't get to see it...until this oh-so happy day. And what do I have to say? 'twas a satisfactory experience. Terror of the undead is a pretty usual theme for horror movies. You've got Romero's groundbreaking Night, Day and Yawn...sorry, I meant Dawn. This, though, is the first horror movie that started from a game, the popular Resident Evil series. It seems to be a profitable deal to ""inspire"" yourself from games, but there is this other thing too. What do Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy and Resident Evil actually point out? The same that a number after a movie does: lack of imagination. A bit more 'obsessive' in the gaming world, but still very present in the cinematic affair as well. I am not against these ""inspired"" movies. As long as they're good, that is. Resident Evil, directed by Paul Anderson, nearly throws up the following storyline: In a top-secret underground facility a deadly (and terribly contaminating) virus is set free. The computer (Red Queen) closes all exists to the outside world, and all the employees (who till recently had worked for the Umbrella Corporation) are killed. But, actually, as you may imagine, they are not quite...dead.Umbrella sends a special agents team to clear up the mess, and set things as straight as possible. This team will actually be shattered in the underground laboratory by what they find there. The stench of death everywhere. Milla Jovovich is the leading actress in the movie - solid reason for avid movie goers to see this one- and she plays the role of a security agent, who works for Umbrella. Incidentally, she suffers a memory loss after she inhales a protection gas released by the Red Queen. We get to find out in the movie who she really is and what she was going to do.Michelle Rodriguez, Mr. Purefoy & company all get together to do their acting tricks and they do them as well as they could've given the film. Now, as all fans of the RE series will say, this film totally sucked. I nearly subscribe. Only 'nearly' because it wasn't the excremental waste the second movie is (I was so naive in thinking it couldn't get any worse). Also, had there not been some very sloppy distribution of zombie actors and had Anderson at least been careful enough to do the simple things right, technically and chronologically speaking, then RE could've stood a chance. All Anderson does is fit in some cool moves, some cool zombie dogs, while leaving the rest of the film to rot.I consider his attitude extremely disgusting: why make a movie called Resident Evil if you don't want it to have anything to do with the game? (yeah, I know, money...it's meant to be rhetorical) It's as simple as this: the film doesn't do justice to the games. So even if RE can be a reasonably satisfactory sit-through, I am absolutely against what Anderson has done to the franchise, which simply wasn't his to ruin.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm shocked by how much I enjoyed this!,"I know the series as a whole gets a lot of hate, but I believe this movie as an individual film is bloody brilliant! After nearly 20 years I couldn't remember a damn thing about it, so I had the joy of watching it for the ""first"" time all over again. It has intrigue, suspense, terror, action and mystery. I was prepared for a fun, silly, early 2000's cheesy action movie and was surprised to find much more than that.
The only thing that loses it for me is the very dated cgi. You lose the terror in those scenes. Every time they cut back to practical effects it's much better.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Incredibly tense movie,"First of all, I want to say that I have never played resident evil or even seen it played, so I have no idea about accuracy to the game, etc.  That being said I will review it as a movie only.This movie is incredibly tense.  Throughout the entire movie I kept waiting for the next jolt/scare, knowing it was coming and still getting startled. The plot proved vaguely interesting, but was largely lost in the carnage. And of course since this is a sci-fi horror the ending left open the possibility of Resident Evil 2.The acting was on par for a horror scifi movie.  Basically the cast was Michelle Rodriguez, Milla Jovovitch and a bunch of guys no one cares about except that they (in some cases) advance the plot.  Milla did a fine job playing the beautiful but tough security agent with amnesia and something to hide.  Michelle played a thug, an annoying thug (as per her usual endeavors).  Both actresses have their pseudo-trademark scenes.  For Milla this means being nearly naked except for, to quote James Bond, A nice nothing she is almost wearing.  For Michelle it is the sweaty hair in the face snarl look.All in all it was better than most game turned movies and about on the same level with other movies of the genre.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you like zombie movies, you will like Resident Evil.","I wasn't going to review this movie, but I just get so MAD when people go on and on about how ""Resident Evil: The Movie"" wasn't an exact representation of ""Resident Evil: The Game Series"".  What you people don't get is that we're talking about two totally different mediums of artistic expression. How can you possibly make a movie and expect to market it to the world if it only makes sense to a certain group of gamers?  And why bother making a movie in the first place since there's already an identical game people can play?Movies are not games.  They tell stories in a different way, and have much less time to do it in than a game does.  This means things have to be changed, shuffled around, and taken right out.  Characters have to be condensed, backgrounds brief, let's get right to the action.  You see what I'm saying?Resident Evil was a fun movie.  It had a comprehensible plot that didn't get bogged down technically with advanced science mumbo jumbo.  This movie basically gives you the skeleton of a much bigger story, and it's up to you to put the missing pieces together.  I never really played the games at all, and I understood everything that was going on.Go see Resident Evil if you enjoy a fast paced movie that is never corny or badly written.  Milla Jovovich was great, and I hope she gets more tough girl roles in the future.  All of the actors were well casted and there were actually a couple of surprises in the script along the way too.But if you're still reading reviews for this movie asking yourself, ""I love zombie movies, but is Resident Evil still worth my time and money?""   IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT ZOMBIES!!  That should be enough to get any fan of the genre out to see this movie.  When was the last zombie movie to hit theaters?  I mean a real zombie movie.  It's been a while right?  Go see Resident Evil.",,Anonymous,Horror

"Rewatched it, was fun","The film might be worth it for the two scenes of 27 year old naked Milla alone, but the rest is fun, too :) The monsters are nicely done, the action high, so about what one would expect for a movie based on an action video game. No wonder it spawned so many sequels, it's one of the few which are watchable.That doesn't mean it's a great film. The editing might be its worst quality, with inexplicable slow motion shots and breaks in continuity. The story is as flat as one could get, the focus being mostly on people surviving monsters and killer AIs, without much consideration on how reality works. I especially loved the safety protocols against viruses: slow moving doors, access panels that can be smashed to open the door and infected monsters to stop infected people from leaving?Anyway, it's a fun film. I don't really remember any of the series and I will soon forget the details of this one. My gut feeling is that the films will slowly improve before becoming really stupidly bad, at least Milla will be acting better.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
AMAZINGLY WELL DONE!,"I want to start off by saying that I was blown away by this movie. I am a big fan of horror movies. And seeing as most video game to movie adaptions are utter complete crap, I wasn't expecting too much from this movie. This movie grabbed my attention from the first frame and held it to the very end. I know what you're thinking....""Resident Evil a '10'?"" Let me tell why this is is so well done. The games mostly focus on a company doing genetic experiments and create zombies. Mayhem ensues. The movie starts out telling you a little about the corporation. Not too much to make it a drawn-out scene, but to give enough to know what is going on. Anderson then makes a seamless transition from the intro right into the lab. The opening scene is done so well, without using a lot of dialogue and letting the music build up the tension. The score really makes the movie. A different score would have made this just another zombie flick, but Manson does his best work to date. (And I'm a big Manson fan who owns all his albums. I am eagerly awaiting his next release after hearing the Resident Evil theme.) The score starts with an ominous sound, followed by a creepy keyboard intro and a simple driving bass riff. As the song progresses, more and more tension builds as drums, guitar and the other sounds are added. This song is short, but works so well with the opening sequence in establishing the tone of the movie. Gothic, haunting and creepy all at the same time. Now about the other fronts. This isn't on the same level as some other movies. It isn't a brilliantly written script. The subject matter isn't very intellectual, but rather primal and savage. When making the judgment, you have to view the movie for what it is. A fun, gore-filled thrill ride. The actors don't do anything oscar-worthy, but they do portray their characters well. The make-up work IS oscar-worthy. While its not on the same level as something like Lord of the Rings, it is still quite amazing in its own right when seeing how many zombies they have to create. I would say the film is well-directed, seeing as the director did make an enthralling movie that kept me glued to my seat for the entire time. I don't think I've been so brought into the world of the film then with this movie. I also jumped at a few parts, which is doesn't happen often. This also has one of the best endings I've seen in a movie. So far, this is hands down the best horror movie I've seen in 2002, one of the best movies of 2002 and one of my favorite movies of the horror genre. I'd place right next to Night of the Living Dead, the other masterpiece. In fact, you could almost call this a modern version of the 1968 classic. Now, for the poor reviewers I have this to say. You probably didn't like this just because Romero didn't direct it. And while I consider Night a classic, I hated the other 2 movies in the Dead trilogy. And you can't say the movie didn't capture the spirit of the game. If anything, it captured it all to well. As with all movies, there are those who love and those who hate. My advice? Give this a try expecting nothing and just watch and enjoy the movie. You'll thank me later.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A hot babe and a gun...good times, good times. 6/10","Flaws and all, Resident Evil manages to be a pretty darn entertaining picture.  This is one of the first FUN films we've seen all year -- it's heads and above trash like The Time Machine.  As one might assume -- the film is full of problems.  For an R rated picture that contains ZOMBIES, the film doesn't have nearly enough gore as it should.  Speaking of zombies -- the zombies in this picture could use some work -- terrible make-up at times.  A good amount of the action scenes are sloppy -- the director just kind of throws the camera into the carnage and the audience is suppose to make sense of it all.  The film has a lot of problems like this, but it still manages to deliver on the goods.  The film benefits from an amazingly sexy Milla Jovovich.  She makes the film work much in the same way Angelia Jolie made Tomb Raider the guilty pleasure it was.  The film also stands up pretty well when you compare it to the video games (which I myself am a fan of).  Not a very good film, but if you are in the mood for some zombie killing but a sexpot, like I was -- you probably won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Stuff,"Resident Evil was a suprise in that it is a rather good film.  Milla Jovovich helps this by being easy on the eye.  The action was fairly well paced with some good scenes that made you jump and it was also great to see a lot of the chracters from the game, we did not see enough of the dogs.  I felt where the movie mis-fired slightly was that it had a subplot with Milla's character and few others suffering memory loss.  I don't feel it added to the movie just made you think what's going on.  I would have prefered a straight forward action film in the vain of Aliens where she takes the role of Jill Valentine.  That would have rocked.  The ending is left wide open for the sequel, let's just hope that this is the direction they go in for that one.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

wonderful action scene,"It is a science fiction horror film and based on the video game. I have never played this game so I had only known there are many zombies and people fight them. After watching this movie, I surprised that characters are very attractive. This story is not only scary but also describe of human involvement. Alice, who is a main character of this film has no memories when she awakes. As the story goes on, gradually she regains own memories. I think these flashback scenes are great. We can realize many things at the same time she remembers her memory. It is very exciting to revere many secrets such as who is she and what she wanted to do before she lost her memories. There are many zombies and cruel scenes so this film is scary for me. However, I enjoyed action scene of Alice and her company very much.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
At Home in this Residence,"I remember the first time I caught this it was by accident (?) The opening sequence where they explain an underground facility intrigued me so I stayed with it. It pulled me right in. The story is rather unique and they pull it off in a credible way. Who doesn't like a secret underground city type facility, run by a computer that has had a breakdown of some sort being investigated by an elite squad of Marine types? It just captures you as the story unravels quite nicely. It had some nice scares and twists and just when you think you are out it pulls you back in more than once I might add. Its just a well executed movie. While I prefer no nudity in the movies, this was understandable as the story presents it. It does distract but for Hollywood that means $$$. This went on to launch a series of movies so need for me to go on and on. Give a look-see and find out what this is all about. BTW...I like to eat while watching. However, Zombie films don't stimulate the appetite and this had plenty of thrill-action keeping you occupied. Do have a tasty drink and perhaps some sunflower seeds on standby.

Save us George A. Romero!!!,"I had heard good things about this movie.  That it was a video game movie that worked,  that it was actually scary.  It is with great disappointment, then, that I must report that Resident Evil was none of those things.  There are so many problems with this film.  The main one being that all the characters and performances are excruciatingly one-note.  The worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez who never strays from that horrible scowl she has on her face the entire film.  Milla Jovovich, while nice to look at, gives a dull and lifeless performance.  The rest of the cast is simply forgettable.  This movie ends with a set-up for a sequel which LOOKS to be more promising than this one, but if Paul Anderson is in charge forget it. This doesn't measure up in any aspect to the classic George A. Romero zombie trilogy.  This movie takes the genre that Romero practically invented, (and which the video games admirably payed homage too) and destroys it.  Please Mr. Romero make a new zombie film to erase the awful memory of this sorry excuse for a movie about the walking dead!  Either that or I'll just have to watch Dawn of the Dead again and again and again and again.....",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Alice, what's the matter?","When a film version of Resident Evil was originally mooted, George Romero was down to direct, a fact that had long-time zombie fans like me drooling in anticipation; eventually, however, Paul W.S. Anderson got the gig, a guy who, to put it mildly, has never been as revered by horror fans as old-timer George. While I have never really understood the dislike for Anderson, finding his films to be mindlessly enjoyable popcorn fodder, I had to admit I was also disappointed by the news, and just a little bit wary.Imagine my joy, then, when Resident Evil was finally released and I discovered that Anderson had done a bang-up job, delivering a superb balance of ballistic action and atmospheric horror that stayed faithful to the source material to please the gamers and yet remained just as accessible to non-gamers; sure, part of me still wanted to see what George would have done with the film, but I was thrilled with the results nonetheless.Nowadays, having seen Romero's last three chapters in his Dead series (Land, Diary and Survival) and sadly realising the the guy no longer has the magic touch, I reckon that hiring Anderson was the wise decision after all. Although not as gory as I would have perhaps liked (you can never have too much splatter), Resident Evil is a quality slice of zombie mayhem: Anderson's direction is slick, without being too showy (ie., he doesn't resort to an overkill of trendy editing), there are some cracking special effects (for the day), and the cast all do a great job, with feisty female leads (Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez) not only kicking zombie butt in style but lighting up the screen with their loveliness in the process.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best horror movies ever!,"Resident Evil was a wonderful horror movie. The zombies are realistic (as far as zombies can get). The suspense is unbelievably haunting. Plus, the end (with out giving to much away) was just plain cool.My only complaint was that it was too short, it could have been 4 hours long and it still would have been to short. As far as it being like the games: it's got a compilation of characters.I personally didn't like the game (well at least the first one) but, the movie kicked-ass! I give it two thumbs up for being my favorite horror movie (Minus the Evil Dead trilogy) ever!",,Anonymous,Horror
One of the better video game movies.,"More and more, studios are turning popular video game titles into movies. Unfortunately, more often than not, these films tend to turn out between mediocre and awful. The one film that rose above the norm in my opinion was Final Fantasy, which, despite its shortcomings, still provided some wonderful entertainment.Resident Evil is much like Final Fantasy in that respect. For one thing, it never pretends to be anything more than it is, a film based on a video game that already has a B-movie plotline. Naturally, it's not going to win any academy awards, but Paul Anderson managed to make a film that should leave most viewers satisfied as long as they aren't too condescending in their opinion.The action sequences are energetic, which is an accomplishment when you consider that the vast majority of the monsters in the film shuffle along at about two miles an hour. Some of the scenes with the zombies massed together resembled a literal mosh pit of the damned.While the film doesn't contain any characters from the video games, it's obvious that Anderson did his homework when he wrote the script. The movie functions well as a prequel and to my knowledge doesn't contradict plotline of the games. In many respects, the movie was tailored a bit more to the fans of the games than the general viewing public. Perfectly setting up room for a sequel, fans may yet get a chance to see some of the game series's heroes in living color. It certainly deserves a sequel more than Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, in any case.To sum up, while Resident Evil is most certainly a popcorn flick, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film. It has its entertaining moments, and if it's given the benefit of the doubt, it has its rewards as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A very enjoyable adaptation of the survival horror games...,"Well, being a long time fan of the ""Resident Evil"" games - been playing those since the original game was released. So having a movie adaptation for the franchise has been good. Well, at least it started out alright, and then as the franchise progressed, the steam just deflated the balloon.I will say that writer and Paul W.S. Anderson actually managed to capture the essence of the ""Resident Evil"" games with this 2002 movie, and at the same time he managed to make the movie action-packed and thrilling, as I doubt a movie as slow paced as the game would prove for less adequate entertainment.I have watched this 2002 ""Resident Evil"" movie about four or five times already over the years since it was released. And I can honestly say that this particular first movie in the franchise keeps being as entertaining as it was the first time I saw it.There is a good storyline to the movie, albeit it is one that is very familiar if you have played the games, for better or worse. But still, regardless of you having played the games or not, there is something in this 2002 movie for just about everyone in the audience.The movie has a very great cast ensemble to portray the various characters and roles, and I think they casted people quite well for ""Resident Evil"". Normally, I am not overly keen on Milla Jovovich, but she carries herself quite well as Alice. Furthermore, the movie also have the likes of Eric Mabius, Martin Crewes and Colin Salmon. And of course then there is also James Purefoy and Michelle Rodriguez, and ""Resident Evil"" really is their movie, because they were really outstanding in the movie and portrayed their characters with such grace and intensity.For a zombie movie, then there is a lot of action in ""Resident Evil"", and it works out well, especially since the movie starts out slow, dropping hints to the fans and slowly builds up the atmosphere and director Paul W.S. Anderson lines up the events quite well and executes them great on the screen. I will say that ""Resident Evil"" is a very intense zombie movie, and it definitely feels like you are right there in The Hive, deep underground with the characters in the movie.Something that should be said worked really well for ""Resident Evil"" was the way that it was filmed, lots of scenes were so true to what you experience in the games, such as long corridors, enclosed spaces, etc. That was just pure candy for us fans of the games.The movie also had good zombie make-up and effects. And of course, this being a ""Resident Evil"" movie based loosely on the first game, then you also have the zombie dogs and the lickers. Now, the zombie dogs were really great. And while the lickers are a crucial part of the ""Resident Evil"" lore, then the CGI here in this 2002 movie really didn't do them full justice, as they looked like what they were; CGI animated. It was a shame.""Resident Evil"" is a movie that can be watched over and over.My rating of Paul W.S. Anderson's 2002 movie is a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Yeah, you like how I taste, don't you?""","""Resident Evil"" starts off with a slam-bang double-opening - inside an ultra high-tech underground research-and-development facility, something goes terribly wrong and a gas escapes as the facility's emergency system kicks in, locking down the building and resulting in the apparent deaths of hundreds of employees; at about the same time, above ground, a young woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up inside a grand mansion with no memory of who she is, only minutes before the place is stormed by a group of well-armed commandos. Thus begins the successful movie adaptation of the ""Resident Evil"" series of video games.The acting here is equally note-perfect: Milla is at the top of her game and shows off her acting chops as well as her more corporeal talents; in the hands of a lesser actress the role would have been generic action-flick fodder. Michelle Rodriguez (Ocampo) keeps snarling and cracking wise 'til the bitter end; Eric Mabius is charmingly and appropriately plastic (where is his character coming from, anyway?) and also carries off his role like a champ. Colin Salmon (James ""One"" Shade) once again bravely carries Shakespearean delivery into Anderson's laser jaws of death, while James Purefoy does what he has to do as the poor man's Chris Lambert. He's a good villain, and because of that you end up rooting for the zombies and even the disgusting ""Licker"". A word should be said about the special features here: while it's a treat to have a ticket to the less ambitious ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", fans of the original will find the six segments on the special effects centerpieces of the film tasty, particularly in the mix between good old-fashioned animatronics and CGI. The alternate ending is amusing for completest, if only to show just how critical a solid editor can be. And without a doubt, the hysterical main commentary track with Anderson, Jovovich, and Rodriguez is worth the price of admission alone. Lucky, lucky Paul Anderson!Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not the most faithful adaption but ok,"As a massive fan of the Resident Evil games, I was excited as all hell for the movie.I went to the premiere and left feeling somewhat disappointed. I did enjoy the movie but it did not feel like it was Resident Evil. More like a sci fi horror film with some nods to the game.I knew already it wasn't gonna be the most faithful adaption going in to it, but at least add some of what made the game famous. And the stuff they did add, such as the dogs and licker was well done. The zombie 's were pretty good but they were not terrifying at all. The build up until you see the first zombie was really well done.The soundtrack was very good and I enjoyed that tremendously. Milla Jovovich was pretty good as Alice.I just wish they made it somewhat more faithful to the game. It would not have been too hard to adapt the first game into a movie.

Agh Kill Me Now................................,"I expected a slick American CGI explosion fest from this. The Film 4 logo on the opening credits was a bit of a give away. What we got was a cheapo British film with limited special effects and crap sets. The only special effects that were tagged onto this prosaic exploration of concrete tunnels and an office building were the laser slice up session, the CGI Alien creature rip off, the unexplained red dogs ( some which seemed to be a real dog covered in paint )a few slow motion bullets a la Band of Brothers and the Matrix and the hologram of the little girl. The rest was low budget British TV movie fare of the lowest order. Very basic zombies. i.e paint ordinary blokes in white paint, and add a bit off blood. Then the script. Where do you begin ? Basically take Aliens Space Marines and replace them with clichéd SAS types straight out of Ultimate Force. Don't even change the Hispanic girl Marine from Aliens, keep her in. Chuck in some Bourne Identity amnesia for the two central characters. This helps when they look bored and confused and disclaim their lines as if wishing they were somewhere else. Add some water. Hey it worked in the Abyss ! Then when the rushes still seem boring, throw in two nearly nude scenes of Mila for the teenage pervs to salivate over. If they'd had the bottle to make them fully nude it might have been worth the wait. But like everything else in this shoddy film they were half hearted.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Science-fiction horror classic of the early years of the new millennium that has aged surprisingly well,"Resident Evil is the first of six live action movies based upon the Japanese Biohazard video game franchise. The movie tells the story of a mysterious attack on an underground research facility known as The Hive that is owned by Umbrella Corporation. A specialized commando attempts to enter the vast complex and find out what has happened. Three amnesiacs who are found near the facility are captured by the the commando. The group soon realizes that the scientists have been murdered and that the research facility hides abominable secrets that put their lives in danger.This movie has aged surprisingly well. The special effects look barely dated and convince with a gripping dystopian atmosphere. The locations are particularly intriguing as the entire movie takes place in a dark underground research facility and its immediate surroundings. The soundtrack underlines the film's atmosphere and comes around with sinister, liberating and gripping nu metal and alternative rock music. The story comes around with a few twists and turns. The characters are quite intriguing, especially enigmatic lead character Alice played by an excellent Milla Jovovich, tough police officer Rain Ocampo played by Michelle Rodriguez and the holograph played by Michaela Dicker who represents the facility's artificial intelligence known as the Red Queen. Resident Evil offers a balanced mixture of atmospheric and tense sequences and brutal and dynamic scenes. The combination of action, horror, mystery and science-fiction elements is also quite balanced.In the end, Resident Evil is certainly one of the very best live action movies based upon a video game franchise. I initially watched this film as a teenager and liked it but I have recently been watching it again as an adult and have come to the conclusion that I like it even better today than I did back in the days. The movie is in the spirit of numerous horror and science-fiction movies of the late nineties and early years of the millennium such as Cube, Equilibirum and My Little Eye.

"It's Fine, But it Ain't Resident Evil","The film is alright, mostly. It's just, alright. The acting is hammy, the writing's mediocre, the soundtrack is generic, the visual look is basic and ugly, the story is generic and we've all seen it before. It lies between a rock and a hard place in the unfortunate spot of ""okay."" It's average. And that's fine, if you wanna watch an average action movie more power to you. But the main problem is, it doesn't have a damn thing to do with Resident Evil. The only thing that ties it to its source material is people throwing around the term ""Umbrella Corporation."" The Hive is made up. The Red Queen is made up. The main characters' team is made up. And hey, I mean, if you wanna maybe have your film pave its own path that's fine I guess, but the sequel for this film is very clearly supposed to be based on Resident Evil 2/3, so that excuse doesn't fly. 
 Even if they did try to make their own story they should have had it actually feel like something that would be in Resident Evil. As it stands, the adventures of Anderson's wife in The Hive feels like fan-fiction. Except calling it fanfiction is a stretch because I'm pretty sure Anderson probably never played any of the games, and just read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia. Of course at the very end, they tease with the phrase ""Nemesis program"" as both a fanbase ego-stroke and a sequel bait. The film is Uwe Boll-tier. In fact I think the only reason it performed better than Boll's Alone in the Dark adaptation is because Resident Evil is a Japanese series and most people over here that follow it probably know as little about it as Paul W.S. Anderson did.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Having reviewed, I wouldn't recommend though.StorylineThe story was well introduced, so the background could be clearly understood. Often, horror films neglect the setting, so this was positive. It didn't however, go into any detail prior to weird and wonderful creatures appearing. This made the context of some lifeforms, impossible to comprehend. It meant, you couldn't understand where some creatures had emerged from, or how they came into being. Some of the film was rendered tame, because of this.
The storyline involved multiple locations which was good, but this didn't add much enjoyment overall.
The plot was a simple, yet clever, idea. One that should have lead to tense circumstances regularly. It could have been far better used however. The plot, whilst good, in my opinion for the significant film length, had to be epically supported by tension building effects such as strange sounds, changing lighting, unpredictable occurrences, and appropriately fearful responses. Long horror films do rely on such quality, which was sadly absent here.TensionAt moments of attack, things should have been suspenseful. Creatures did allow tension to be created at a few sweet spots, but these were seldom regular. Special camera angles or effects would have helped increase tension. Music was barely used, and the infected creatures didn't make noises effectively enough, to create a tense atmosphere. Lighting wasn't varied enough, and injured struggles weren't prevalent.
I wanted to believe character adrenaline, but I'm still not truly convinced they had any.CharactersA wide variety of creatures and infected humans were encountered, and some facial expressions were effective. A lack of stress under the circumstances, actually made it unrealistic though. The character make-up and creature movements however, appeared sleek and interesting. Creature body forms seemed well considered and should have been intimidating. Characters seemed fairly well played, with a few stand outs, using facial expressions well to combat fairly unimaginative, camera angles.
There were some close-ups used effectively, albeit very rarely. Enemies weren't unpredictable, and generally attacked as expected. Not helping the fear factor.All settings were well lit, and shadows weren't used. A lack of subtle suggestion then, didn't put you on edge. Certain scenes were horrific and gory, yet didn't elicit a believable horrified reaction, from peers or the viewer. Again, sound effects to accompany gore, just weren't there !SummaryTension building effects such as strange sounds, varying lighting, unpredictable occurrences, and appropriately fearful responses were lacking. They couldn't lift a variety of imaginative characters and creatures, beyond a fairly uninteresting entity.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I actually liked this film,"While never having played the games, the movie was rather interesting. Granted, the acting wasn't exactly something to write home about, the music, cinematography and the lighting proved to give this film a boost. The production value was also exceptional, allowing the effects to be legitimate as opposed to being some hokie paint on CGI. I've also wondered, Why does Milla Jovovich show her breasts in every movie and photo shoot she is in? Gets kind of dull after a while. Anyway, I will state this, the ending proved to be one of the finest constructed moments in sci-fi history.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome horror flick that people twenty years from now should still remember.,"Okay, so ""RESIDENT EVIL"" wasn't up there in the high ranks with films like ""ALIENS"" and ""DAWN OF THE DEAD"", but it still gave me a reasonable amount of scares that I haven't experienced since the late 1980's.Primarily based on the successful video games, ""RESIDENT EVIL"" is a brooding piece of work that builds up suspense and horror in a claustrophobic-like atmosphere where a group of soldiers and two guards must infiltrate the headquarters known as 'the Hive' of a high-tech operation known as 'the Umbrella Organization' to shut down a mainframe computer that is known as 'the Queen Bee'. Little do they know that all 500 employees working in the Hive are now dead and have been re-animated as zombies while all other creatures inside have mutated into horrifying monsters.It appears that someone broke into the laboratories to steal a heavily-guarded experiment known as ""The T-Virus"" which has the ability to re-animate the dead. When the virus is stolen, the culprit throws one of the test-tubes containing the virus onto the floor which shatters, resulting the Hive in shutting itself down and trapping everybody inside the underground complex.Milla Jovovich is one of the guards who was supposed to protect the Hive. She is found in an outpost with severe memory loss of her identity and occupation. She along with the group of soldiers and one more guard are taken deep into the Hive. When all Hell breaks loose after the zombies and monsters are unleashed, you will be taken on an unforgettable thrill ride that will leave you riveted to your seat!Most of the praise for this movie lies within the special effects. I enjoyed seeing the zombified dogs and the creatures inside the huge metal containers. The only thing I was a little disappointed with were the zombies themselves. I am very serious when it comes to my zombies, so I was very excited to see the ones featured in this movie. When one man is attacked by a swarm of zombies and is basically eaten alive, I expected to see some good shots of limbs being torn off or flesh being eaten. Instead you only get to see a few of the zombies 'pretending' to bite into him as he screams, and later when he himself has been re-animated as one of the undead, the only signs of his demise are a few bite marks and some trickles of blood running down his face. Other than that, it appears as if the zombies didn't even bite into him at all! A few other scenes also display the same issue - one including a moment where a man is killed after a mutant beast 'eats' him, yet when looking closer at his body in a later part of the film when he too becomes one of the 'undead', he also appears not to have been injured greatly either. One might think that they originally died from fright!One small minor problem I had with the movie was the lack of characters left to 'survive' a sequel. The ending was fantastic - a deserted city scape left in ruin and pandemonium by something horrific, a door left open for a future sequel.I hope they make a sequel. I remember when ""STARSHIP TROOPERS"" came out and all actors involved had signed on for a trilogy, yet it performed very poorly at the box office meaning no sequels would be made. I don't care if ""RESIDENT EVIL"" only makes $1.00 in its opening weekend, I want to see a sequel!My Rating - 8 stars out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The first ""Resident Evil"" film is a very, very guilty pleasure.  Dopey (if not just plain dumb) beyond belief but a TON of fun.","The world of Video-Game-to-Film adaptations is a very dark place in the world of entertainment. Over the past 20 years, starting in the 90's, video-games have become increasingly elaborate, cinematic and sophisticated in terms of storytelling, often delving into deep plots and rich character development that rivals the best in Hollywood filmmaking. Especially in recent years, with the release of games like ""Uncharted"", ""Heavy Rain"" and many others, which feel more akin to interactive films than they do like old-school video-games.Yet, Hollywood has yet to figure out how to properly release a video-game adaptation. Starting with the abysmal 90's adaptation of ""Super Mario Bros."", the studio system has displayed once major flaw over and over again that has plagued every video-game adaptation since: Studios do not understand, nor do they make any effort to understand, video-games and gaming culture.Studios (and many modern producers, directors and writers) seem stuck in a very 80's mindset that games are merely mindless entertainment without stories, and/or can somehow be made ""better"" by violently altering the source material's stories and characters. And thus so many video-game to film adaptations are released that bear little-to-no resemblance to their source material. Yes, almost every single video-game film has relied on making radical and unneeded changes to their source material, under the delusion that they need to change things to make it work. To date, there have been virtually no video-game movies that have actually resembled the original games.And Paul W.S. Anderson's ""Resident Evil"" is definitely a major offender in this respect. Yes, it is a film that almost exclusively alters, disregards and even disrespects its source material, turning the original slow-moving and deliberate Romero-esque video game into a goofy, pseudo-James Cameron-inspired action extravaganza.But you know what? Looking past how much it disrespects the original ""Resident Evil"" game franchise... it's actually not too terrible a film. Oh, it's bad. Pretty darned bad. But it's also wildly entertaining, and is clearly full of the rampant eye-candy that Director Anderson relishes in. And in terms of sheer, unadulterated entertainment value... you could do much worse.We follow Alice (Milla Jovovich), an amnesiac woman who awakens in a seemingly deserted mansion. After encounter another survivor (Eric Mabius) and a group of commandos (including Michelle Rodriguez), she is whisked away into ""The Hive"", a technologically advanced underground compound below the mansion, run by the ""Umbrella Corporation."" Alice, Matt and the commandos are forced to investigate the complex, in order to figure out why it was sealed off, and survive when they realize researchers and scientists of The Hive have become ravenous, zombie-like creatures.The acting isn't too shabby. Jovovich is a lot of fun in the role, underwritten though it may be. Mabius does come off a tad boring, though. And Rodriguez, who I've actually quite admired in some films as a touch-yet-sexy chick, is pretty good in her role.The production is also pretty decent. If there's one thing writer/director Anderson knows, it's how to make pretty pictures on screen. The production design is convincing enough, giving us sleek quasi-futuristic designs, and the production design does lend to some cool action sequences and even a couple of reasonably intense horror segments. I did find some of Anderson's choice in shots and compositions to be over-done at times, though.Unfortunately, the writing is pretty dreadful. Ignoring the fact that it essentially disregards the original video game (save for a few character names and passing references), it's way too fast, and the dialog is very wonky.But still, this is one of those movies where you care more about the images than the written words. As mentioned above, Anderson is a king at making ""pretty pictures"", and here, asides from his more over- the-top visuals, he delivers on some great action beats and decent sequences of suspense. So I can't say the film is a total loss just because the script kinda sucked. Anderson seemed to have the mindset that he wanted to make a fun action-horror movie. And I think that's pretty much what this film is.It's criminally stupid at times. It's under-written. But there's enough guns, gore and even some exploit-o-riffic nudity in a few sequences, so I'd say audiences looking for a good time should get what they're pay for. I like it as dumb fun as a 25-year-old male, as do my college-aged friends and even my 50-something-year-old mom. So that should tell you that it's worth checking out once for sheer dumb- fun.I give it a 6 out of 10, just for entertainment value. However, if you are looking for a film that is very well-made or true to the video-game source material, you will be very disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Did everyone see else a different film?,"This film was absolutely horrible.  I rarely write any reviews, but this was the absolutely worse film I have seen in years.  It made Mission to Mars look like an epic.  The film is just nonsense action followed by nonsense action.  None of the characters are ever developed, they try but the actors obviously don't know what they were supposed to be doing, so the audience never figures it out.  Certain plot elements like the zombies completely surrounding them just disappear after a while and noone seems to notice. They have the typical problem that bad horror films have of inconsistency. Sometimes, one thing will kill a monster and in a different scene, someone does the same thing to the monster 25 times and it hardly flinches.  I guess it was supposed to be a prequel for the video games, but even with that it seemed unfinished at all levels.  I was a little tired before going to this film and got myself awake early in the film and watched it.  I wish I had just fallen asleep and had some productive time for my 5 bucks.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Be afraid.... BE VERY AFRAID...,"Just watched it today at my local cinema, and was totally blown away by everything. Terrific action, suspense, blood and guts, cool special effects, all the right combination that made the game of the same name so popular. A salute to the director.Although I was a bit disappointed that Jill Valentine and all the familiar characters from the videogame wasn't there. Maybe the reason why, I guess, was to avoid the plot predictability like 'oh she's gonna die soon' and 'oh, that one will live' and the likes. But as a fan of the game series also, I was glad that there are some references like the T-Virus, zombie dogs, walking dead, the deadly licker, underground base, labs, the transport train. There is one scene when the protagonist was escaping the facility which would ring some deja-vu to those who played the game.On to the cast, Milla Jovovich who somehow adds some femme fatale to her role - as she did likewise in the Fifth Element, Michelle Rodriguez (Fast and the Furious) reprises her tough girl role. Kudos to all those who played the commandos and zombies, and also the childlike Red Queen.All in all, i am just waiting here for the next sequel.",,Anonymous,Horror
A cool movie,"It does follow a futuristic sci fi action movie formula.  The characters have been done before- on the team there's the 1. black guy who dies 2. the smart one who no one believes 3. the one who's been attacked already and has like a virus in them 4. the one who is cool with 2. but dies and 5. the one who no one likes cause the person is a bitch or an asshole.  The laser things that cut people up are cool, and the Red Queen is weird and funny cause she's a little British hologram girl.  It's a typical sci-fi movie, but one of the more fun ones.

Pretty good for a zombie movie.,"First of all, let me start by saying that I am not a huge fan of the video games (or zombie films for that matter).  I own the three games for the playstation, but I could never really get into them.As for the movie, I thought it was fairly entertaining.  It had it's good points and low points, like most movies.  The story is nothing terribly intellectual, but it's interesting.  There are a lot of things you just have to accept and take for granted in the film.  Such as why on earth they would have created this virus in the first place, and what on earth that crazy dog beast thing was!  But, ok, I'll accept it.The only major complaint I have about the film is the music in the film.  I love type of music that they used in the film, in fact I own a lot of the music that was used in the film, but it seemed to me that most of the time the music was just overwhelming and out of place.The special effects in this film were surprisingly good.  I wasn't really impressed with the trailers for this film, but seeing them in context made it much better.The acting is nothing to get excited about.  It's good, but it's a zombie movie, so you can't really expect great performances.  Milla Jovovich looked really good in this film, and there are even a few times where Michelle Rodriguez cracked a smile and looked pretty.  She always seems to have scowl on her face, and her eyes are always up in her eyebrows.  The only other cast member I'd heard of was Eric Mabius, he did just fine with his role. Although, I did recognize Colin Salmon from the 2 (soon to be 3) most recent James Bond films.  He did a fine job as well.I would think that anyone that likes zombie movies and those type of films would like this one.  Also, if you're into gory films, you may want to check this out.  I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-Chris",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Exciting,"The Umbrella Corporation is a multi-conglomerate which operates a secret underground laboratory beneath a metropolitan area called Raccoon City. Inside the lab, scientists were illegally producing a virus which reanimates dead human beings. Realizing that the T-virus was worth a great sum of money on the black market, a thief steals the virus. However, just before attempting to escape the facility with the virus and the antidote, he deliberately contaminates the lab. Unfortunately, he doesn't quite make it out before being knocked out by nerve gas. A crack team of commandos then enter the facility and capture three people: ""Alice"" (Milla Jovovich), ""Matt Addison"" (Eric Mabius) and ""Spence Parks"" (James Purefoy). Everyone else has been supposedly killed by the computer defense system known as ""the Red Queen"". Racing against time, the commandos enter the facility known as ""the hive"" to disable the Red Queen and find out what has happened. Anyway, rather than divulge anything that might spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, I will stop right here. However, I would like to say that while the overall acting isn't that great, Milla Jovovich, and to a lesser extent Michelle Rodriguez (as the commando named ""Rain Ocampo""), give awesome performances. Additionally, the action is fast-paced and the music complements it very well. All in all, I found this movie to be very exciting and it should appeal to those who like an action-packed thriller of this sort.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of Best zombie movies,"""Resident Evil"" is a 2002 horror film directed by Paul W. S. Anderson and starring Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and Eric Mabius. As a big fan of zombie movies, I have to say that this film is one of my all-time favorites. I've watched it five times now, and it never gets boring.The film is based on the popular video game series of the same name, and it does an excellent job of capturing the essence of the games while still being its own thing. The atmosphere is creepy and tense, and the action scenes are thrilling and well-choreographed.One of the things I appreciate most about the film is the attention to detail. From the costumes to the sets, everything feels authentic and well thought out. The zombies are particularly well done, with their grotesque appearances and unsettling movements.The cast is also superb, with each actor bringing something unique to their role. Milla Jovovich is fantastic as the lead character Alice, and Michelle Rodriguez is equally impressive as Rain. Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, and Colin Salmon round out the cast with strong performances of their own.Overall, ""Resident Evil"" is a must-see for fans of horror and zombie movies. It's a well-crafted film that pays homage to the source material while still standing on its own. Highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good not-too-clean fun.  Not an intellectual event, NOT MEANT TO BE.","This is a good zombie movie, despite not mentioning the word zombie once. Alice is a great leading lady, despite never being called Alice once. Turn it on, turn your brain off, and enjoy the action!Fans of the game complain that it's not faithful to the story lines of the game, but you have to recognize it for what it is. It is its own movie, not a live-action carbon copy of a video game. If you like the game's story, play the game. The movie doesn't have to follow it exactly to be a success.The CG work is looking pretty dated, but not bad. The zombie practical make-up effects are great. Sets are good and contribute a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. Plenty of good fight scenes, suspense, and gross zombie behavior.The best scene in the movie is the end. It goes out with a bang, leaving you wanting more and wondering if the sequel will satisfy you.One note: don't base your opinion of this movie on what you see on cable.

Almost a Jill Sandwich.,"It's a well-known fact that 'Resident Evil (2002)' has very little resemblance to, well, any of the video-games in the series it is based on. It has a mansion and some familiar monster designs but that's about it. This isn't atmospheric horror, it's schlocky sci-fi. Of course, that alone doesn't make it a bad film. It's the choppy editing, forced early-2000s edginess, poor CGI, bland characters and barely-there plot that does that. There are occasional moments of hammy ridiculousness that come very close to replicating a certain B-movie charm (see Milla Jovovich running up a wall and spin-kicking a zombie dog through a window), but these moments are simply too few and far between. For the most part, the piece is just dull. It also suffers from some major story and character issues; I literally can't think of a reason why the focal military unit actually enter the H.I.V.E. and there's more charisma in a loaf of bread than there is in any of the lead performances. The whole thing is just a mess. It has a few enjoyable moments but, overall, it isn't particularly entertaining. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Resident Evil A Decent Movie Based On A Video Game,"Resident Evil is a decent movie based on a video game but not the greatest from director Paul W.S. Anderson who for the most part gives fans of the game what they come to except from these type of films. The cast are good in their roles including Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Martin Crews, and Colin Salmon in a brief extended appearance. The action which is pretty much non stop once they reach the Hive involving people mostly shooting at zombies and creatures created by the T-Virus are well executed. The special effects are impressive but at times you can definitely tell it's CG. The zombies and the Licker look terrifying like something out of your worst nightmares. Well done. The dialogue however wasn't the greatest at times, it was a little predictable, and some characters are written out too soon for you to care about whether they survive or not. Depite its flaws though overall Resident Evil is decent with enough action, gruesome deaths, impressive special effects, some suspense, and good performances by the cast who make it worth watching but this movie could've been better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the cornerstones of horror genre,"Resident Evil franchise has quite frankly gotten out of hand. At the moment there are five movies made and a sixth in the making. Not all of them are that good, but most of them wouldn't exist if not for this film's good qualities and success.Resident Evil benefits from an interesting setting, full of creeping zombies and other monstrosities, as well as from some really nice actors doing their best to breath life into this video game adaptation. Both Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are perfect fit for their respective roles and really nail the tough action woman ideal. And yes, none of the characters in this film are all that deep or have good lines of dialogue, but such a flaw can be forgiven if the horror works well. And it does. The zombies are suitably scary, The Red Queen is unbelievably unnerving, the rest of the monsters, both supernatural and human, are a genuine threat and as a whole the film has a good claustrophobic feel to it. Would it have been better with more rounded characters and better dialogues? Of course, but it's not bad as it is.Aside from the characters, the film's biggest weakness, to me at least, is the fact that sometimes the video game shines through a bit too much. They make a commendable effort to make the film its own creation, but there are certain scenes, which just scream ""a boss fight"" or ""a platforming section"". Minor things really, but they do take away from the experience.As a whole Resident Evil is a lot of fun. It's actually scary because of its excellent premise and setting, because of its atmosphere and because it doesn't rely solely on jump scares. Definitely worth checking out for any fan of zombies and/or horror in general.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Years of sequels and still the most solid, story-driven of the franchise!","I want to start off this review by saying that I am a fan of the video game franchise- far more than I am the film franchise. However, this review is an honest review about the film- Resident Evil- and the overall film franchise.For starters the film kicks-off with a laboratory catastrophe, a viral outbreak of sorts which in turn, forces an emergency lock down on the facility leaving many for dead- setting the tone for the overall story line to this film. Milla Jovovich plays Alice, a woman who mysteriously awakens from an unconscious state which is implied to be taking place after the lab catastrophe. The mystery revolving her whereabouts, her identity, and the lingering sensation that she may be in immediate danger soon draws the audience in for the remaining 90 minute, action-packed Sci-Fi thriller!Alice, along with a clean-up crew made up of a special military unit, soon unravel the horrible truth as to why the laboratory was put into lock down and the doors should have stayed locked! Brought to you with a chilling soundtrack, plenty of intense horror sequences, and jam-packed with some exciting choreography and action- Resident Evil is a truly timeless Sci-Fi thriller. Unlike its preceders, Resident Evil provides an intriguing story, a solid and likable cast, and ties up its own loose ends before setting us up for the sequel to follow.Without a doubt in my mind, Resident Evil is by far the best film in the entire franchise. This is a film that knew exactly what it wanted to provide its audience- a fast-paced Sci-Fi thriller that would be enjoyable to those who played the games and to those who didn't- and needless to say Resident Evil nailed it! If you're a fan of the genre and have yet to get your hands on a copy, I highly recommend doing so. As stated, this a timeless flick that is great to watch for a little bit of action, suspense, and everything else you'd expect from a Sci-Fi film.8/10 - and by far the best film of the franchise!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I feel it will become a classic like Alien,"(This is my first review comment so I hope it is OK) Resident Evil is based on the video game (VG) franchise developed by Capcom. My understanding of the VG is that it is about a dark time in the future when a ""T virus"" developed by a megacorporation for military purposes escapes into the public and begins to re-animate dead people. The movie does not drift far from this plot but has some particularly compelling twists.1) As much as the VG is about a dark megacorporation, the movie captures this ethos quite succinctly. The attitude of the corporations agents and officers mirror what you, I or anyone could turn into if we were to more vigilant in our own workplace. It is a dark future and the movie captures the mentality of those salarymen, even the mercenary soldiers, quite well.2) The acting is very purposeful and there is good chemistry. I believe Milla had a role in this because she has a natural flair for adding a unique and useful dimension to a cast as well as projecting her own self as she did in 5th element. The actors quite clearly have looked at the VG and they all do a good job of capturing the feel of the VG and its mysterious, perplexing surroundings.3) I believe it will become a classic like Alien because the movie has so much to tell about how things could go so horribly wrong in humanity's future. This is not just another zombie flick of supernatural resurrection made by John Romero. The movie adds a new epic dimension spawned out of the dark imaginations of the best imaginations in Tokyo. The movie falls into the same genre as Akira or Ghost in a Shell - a retelling of a dark forbidden future where you get to see what you could become like were you to live your whole life there.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Begins,"When I first watched this movie, I was still under the impression, that it could have been made by George Romero. Not a good state of mind to be watching any movie then (at least for me). If I had rated it back then, it would have been a worse rating I can assure you that. Especially because I had read a script (a first draft), of what Romero would have done with it.But as it is, the movie kicked off (literally) a series of movies. And when I re-watched it recently, I did so with the commentary on. And when you listen to the people talk about this movie passionately, you can't help but almost fall in love with it. I was tempted to give it a very high rating then. I think the middle way was good though. There are things that have been done good here (some of the action, the suspense stuff, the casting of Michelle Rodriguez) and others that haven't (the story, the rest of the action as Rodriguez does say so herself on the commentary and some other things).All in all a decent horror movie, but nothing to get too excited about.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Guilty Pleasure,"To be fair the first Resident Evil Film is no masterpiece, but it sure is fun. Starring Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez this is the first film in the long running franchise. The atmosphere is suitably creepy and the effects are mainly on the good side. Colin Salmon also makes an appearance and his fate is well handled. Runtime is a lean 90 minutes and for a mid budget film this looks good, with at times an Aliens feel to it. Plot wise Resident Evil is a little thin but that is to be expected as it is based on a computer game. I found the music on this one a bit intrusive and annoying and a better soundtrack may have elevated things further.

There's just a bunch of guys walking around and killing zombies, and occasionally the zombies kill one of them. Every single moment of the film is a hundred percent predictable, so the 'plot twists' are obvious and the scary parts are simply not scary. The acting is horrible, Marilyn Manson's soundtrack is exactly what you might expect, the directing, plot and dialogue are non-existent.Well, I don't know... Maybe it would be scarier to watch on a big screen in a darkened theater, but to me today's horror directors simply got it wrong. You don't make a movie scary by showing lots of blood and organs and people with no eyes or no jaws. A truly scary movie is created by ATMOSPHERE (note Hitchkok and Kubrick).

"Well, what'd you expect?","I'm baffled at why people have high expectations for movies based on video games. No matter how good the source material is, you can't expect a video game to do good as a movie. I imagine that's where a lot of heat towards this movie is coming from; hordes of Resident Evil game fans who hate the film because it has got very little to do with the games. I agree, it doesn't have a lot to do with the games; there are a few references to various of the video game titles, and there are the zombies, and it does try to build the atmosphere of the games. But it just doesn't work too good in the end. The film is billed as an action/thriller/science fiction/horror film; unfortunately, not too many of those aspects of the film work very good. The action is pretty good, but action sequences are few and far between. The thriller parts are decent enough; I really enjoyed the very last scene. The science fiction portions of the film are not very well thought out or particularly professionally executed; I kind of liked the basic idea of the film, but it just didn't seem to work too well. The horror consists of director Paul W.S. Anderson's personal brand of loud noise, sudden scares/shocks(or attempts at such) and intense rock music. It does have some good scares, and some of the zombie scenes are quite intense. But a big problem with the zombies is the fact that they don't even turn up in the movie for a solid 45 minutes. That's almost half of the film. And there passes many scenes that don't involve any zombies at all. I suppose the film was supposed to be tense during those scenes, as in, the tension of knowing that the zombies are out there, but I was never really afraid of them. The plot is nonsensical and pretty badly put together. The acting is decent, but not at all great. The character development is nearly non-existent. The special effects are great; well, mostly great. There are a few times where the CGI is obvious, and quite a few where it's badly used. Worth noting is the amount of details that are taken from various of the games. Something that annoyed me was the lack of realism in the film; these zombies/walking corpses are supposed to be a few hours old, right? Then how come their teeth are so decayed, half of their faces rotten, and various of their body parts so screwed up? I know it was done for effect, but it was fairly ridiculous. Also, the action and stunts that Milla Jovovich's character pull off is not the least bit realistic, and mainly looks like a direct rip-off of The Matrix. All in all, I suppose it's decent enough. For such a just-above-average-film, I'm surprised at how many times I've managed to sit through it. Maybe that explains my rating. Who knows. I recommend it to fans of the various aforementioned genres. Just watch it with low expectations, and don't try too hard to make sense of the plot. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Resident Evil - Father of the ""zombie virus"" idea? Even if not, excellent zombie film!","As a devout Horror fan, I suggest that Zombie flicks are sort of a different genre. It could be considered a sub-genre of Horror, much like Ghost Stories and ""Torture Porn"", but it's more unique in it's differences, I reckon. I've seen my share of Zombie flicks. Most of them, like world famous Dawn of the Dead, take place in a zombie infected reality, where few survivors try to live through the aftermath of an apocalypse. Resident Evil predates most of the films of the passed decade, and the best thing - it shows the factors that lead to the zombie apocalypse. I must confess that I have no prior experience with the title, not the Comic books nor the animated films. But I very much enjoyed this film!The screenplay and story feel unoriginal, but if anyone knows of the first film that has come up with the idea of a major corporation developing a virus that turns people into zombies, then gets released somehow and infects the world - let me know, because I don't. White Zombie was released in 1932, but involved Voodoo rather than a virus. Resident Evil probably ins't the first, but it was there before many others. The story is great, with good plot twists and delightfully surprising turn of events.This film might not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it's a great and fun to watch zombies film. The acting is good (Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez of course, but I also liked James Purefoy as Spencer). Direction and cinematography are also good, done just right for such a film. I've watched this intending to continue and watch all the anthology, all the way to the latest 2012 film, including the animated films. It seems I'm in for quite a ride!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watch that laser!,"Who knew Paul Anderson had it in him? Well, the fact is, while by no means a great director, he can certainly create mood and atmosphere, as witness EVENT HORIZON. This adaptation of a popular video game has mood and atmosphere to spare, as a top-secret lab experiment goes haywire and soldiers are sent in to deal with the aftermath. Everybody's favorite Fifth Element, Milla Jovovich, is the heroine of the piece, and is surrounded by a cast of mostly unknown actors evidently from many different countries based on their potpourri of accents (the film was shot overseas). Probably the best video game-derived movie to date, as befits one the best video games ever made.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A bad movie based on a video game. What a shock!,"The beginning of this flick is really good and dark, and it have some good elements and a good story, but somehow Paul W.S. Andersson manage to make it ridiculous with stupid kills and bad zombies. I have played the video games and I enjoy them, but when you do a film about a video game you have to focus on the story and not in the action 'cause, here comes the revealing part of this review, aren't the same!!!!!!!!!!! All action video game to be great it needs a deep story and action that can keep up the story. In a movie is all about the story, and some action. But when you put more emphasis in how the dudes are going to die and forget all about the plot in the middle of the movie, well that can't be right.Milla Jovovich saves this movie from the abyss, she's a great actress and I'm in love with her, so everything that she does seems great to me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
High octane zombi flick with an amazing laser defence system scene n ferocious dogs.,"I saw this first in a theatre in 2002. It is a fast-paced, high octane zombie flick filled with brisk action sequences. Revisited it recently on a DVD. Seen all its sequels in theatre. The plot - A virus has been released inside a secret underground lab, turning its workers into zombies, a military task force is deployed to take care of the problem. The lab is filled with traps n packed with flesh-eating creatures n ferocious dogs. The film actually does an efficient job of recreating the ambiance of the video game. The initial office building chaos is great and there's a bit of nastiness involving an elevator scene. The film is famous for its laser defence system scene, the zombified dogs, awesome fight scene with the zombie doberman dogs n different creatures. It is also an adventure film in which the lead characters, especially Milla Jovovich always move forward without looking back. Another known face, Michelle Rodriguez is at her sexiest when wielding a weapon. Paul W.S. Anderson famous for action/horror/sci-fi films did a fine job with the direction.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Scary? This was horror??,"I suppose having not played the game, the movie was less than exciting for me. It was interesting, though I did note a few places where the characters seemed to act illogically or out of character.

Entertaining and a fun zombie thriller.,"Resident Evil 5 out of 5 stars.Great action sequences. I am a huge fan of the game series. May not be the best adaptation. For a movie trying to be its own thing was great. The plot is a little slow. But it picks up. The laser hall scene was intense. The music score is awesome. The script and direction is fast moving. It ends in a cliffhanger for a sequel. The licker monster was awesome. The zombie dog scene with Alice facing against them was awesome.

Not as bad as I remember.,"When I first watched this many moons ago I had the same reaction as every other fan. What does this have to do with the games, this is terrible. It didn't help either that the movies got progressively worse and worse as time went on. However this movie right here is actually really not bad. For what it is, Paul decided to tell an original story in the resident evil universe and I think it's pretty neat. Has lots of intense moments and a good cast of characters with good pacing and the nods to the game that are in there are great. Some questionable story changes but whatever. Overall it's not terrible and a fun movie to watch. The action scenes are really nicely done and not over the top and stupid like the rest of the movies which are THE definition of cash grab. It was very interesting seeing how much this movie also impacted the games. Alice was doing crazy kicks and neck snaps on zombies that were later used by Leon and Hunk in resident evil 4 and the red queen and the thigh zombie kill being used in Umbrella chronicles was also interesting. Whether this was a positive influence on the game franchise is a whole different discussion so I'm just gonna stick to the topic. Worth a watch if you're a fan of the games or not.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not supposed to be scary. This is a just a movie to have fun watching with friends!,"This is not supposed to be a scary movie. Its supposed to be a sci-fi/action/thriller.

Worth your money!,"As a fan of the first three games, I had been following the smattering of details of the movie's progress through production.  I totally forgot about it for about a year, and the unanticipated trailer I saw on television had me cheering out loud.  Even still, I kept my expectations low as I had for previous video-game to movie conversions.I was blown away with the overall quality of the film.  The only negative aspect was the ridiculous dialogue; the actors deserve credit for delivering their lines with skill and grace.  For fans of the games this will be a treat, but I doubt any of them need my opinion to decide or that there are any of them left by now who haven't seen it anyway.  For those of you who may not have any exposure to the games, the film with doubtlessly seem overly contrived and unnatural in pace.  If the term ""survival horror"" doesn't appeal to you, you might want to skip this one.Lastly, I found it humorous that a couple of the characters discarded their firearms after depleting their ammo.  If they wanted to be true to the game, they would have held onto them, hoping for the odd magazine lying in a locker or drawer.",,Anonymous,Horror
Too bad Romero didn't direct this,"I understand George A Romero was at one point going to direct this movie. It might have turned out better, but then Land of the Dead was not what it could have been either. Milla Jovovich is a knockout, and some of the zombie attacks are kind of scary, but this movie tries to make up in stylized action what it lacks in plot. Nowhere near as lame as House of the Dead, but perhaps video games should remain games, not movies. Still, Resident Evil had a few great death scenes. I personally liked the zig-zagging laser which sliced people into bits, but I could've done without the CGI dogs. they looked like dobermans dipped in strawberry jam.

Standard gameplay - standard end,"I'm biased by best games. This is definitely not the best one.

Jumpy episodes and loosely coupled at that are somewhat frustrating - like tasteless food. Suspense is pushed on you (but misses target - it's too thin) - and dissipates before you even start to feel it. Mix of Aliens, Matrix and Living Dead - maybe too many ingredients?

"Video game to movie adaptions suck, or so the saying goes...","I'd have to say that Resident Evil is one of the few video game movies I have ever been at least moderately entertained by. I didn't think it was a good movie, but it was an entertaining mindless romp of zombie killing fun.Sure the script is weak, the acting is horrible, and the direction is needlessly formulaic, but hey it still is kind of fun to watch. Watching the movie is similar to playing through one of the video games, and that's all you should take it as. I can understand why most people and critics didn't like it. But I went to this movie expecting a mindless zombie killing adventure, that's exactly what I got.For fans of the game series, the movie provides some interesting back story. It probably could have been about 20 times better if Romero would have directed it, but I heard that he was straying heavily from the Resident Evil plot line already established in the games.

A Different Side of Horror - Futuristic Style!,"I watched this film a few weeks ago, and I must say, I was really impressed with how this film turned out. It is truly a different look on the horror genre, in a future like style, where characters, villains and the plot itself act very different. I think that RE is one of those good ol' modern horrors which should be given a chance and for good reason.The plot is not looked upon much, and it is very simple. A virus takes over the world, once a contamination is unleashed by a corrupt corporation. Survivorsw team up to survive. Sure simple enough, with not much ground covered, but what makes RE excellent is the action, the character development, the horrific kills, the technical/futuristic music and the theme of it all.I believe all of that stuff is done quite well and it so happens that it can become quite creepy with the dogs.Although RE isn't an award-winning film, it sure has some intense action and scary scenes to keep the viewer looking at the screen as well as pumping out the blood, gore and entertainment.My Verdict is that it is the best in the series (although I do like the rest so far). 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Neither were so jarring as to detract from the overall experience, but I would have liked some of the horror elements to be a little more intelligent and not just rely on jumps.The action hasn't aged awfully well in 20 years, but to be fair to it it still holds up enough to be enjoyable and engaging. I actually thought some of the zombie effects and makeup were pretty solid and hold up to scrutiny all these years later.I actually really enjoyed the story and the Milla Jovovich's character, and am excited to dive into the rest of the franchise.I'd definitely recommend this for any action/zombie lovers.

"Brilliant, mysterious, intense and creepy sci-fi-horror","Paul Anderson's ""Resident Evil"" was released in 2002 and is based on the video game of the same name. I don't play video games so this review is based solely on the film.Since its release I never gave the film any thought, but the red poster & DVD cover with Milla Jovovich in a ripped red dress somehow snuck into my subconscious over the years. Then I caught a 15-minute snippet of the film while channel surfing (not knowing it was ""Resident Evil""). The part I saw was near the beginning where Milla mysteriously wakes up in a shower in a mansion. She obviously doesn't know who she is or where she's at and wanders around the mansion trying to figure things out when -- BAM! -- something happens, but I don't want to give it away.That's all I saw. I didn't have time to watch anymore but I decided right there to pick up the DVD. The set-up is intriguing and brilliantly executed.***PLOT SPOILER*** (Don't read the next paragraph unless you want to know the basic plot)A biological ""accident"" causes the supercomputer that runs an underground complex to shut down the entire facility and gas the 500 workers to death. This installation is called The Hive. The mansion is a secret emergency entrance and a commando force is sent by the Umbrella Corporation to go down and find out what caused the supercomputer -- the Red Queen -- to shut down the facility and kill the people. It turns out that a virus has turned the 500 Umbrella employees into hideous flesh-eating zombies, which may sound totally absurd but the way it's explained in the film is somehow believable, for a sci-fi movie anyway. Milla and the commandos slowly discover the truth. Can they get out alive?***END SPOILER***POSITIVES:As already noted, the opening is truly intriguing, successfully capturing the viewer's attention.The slow revelation of the mystery is superb, including who Milla really is.Milla herself is stunning. The entire film she runs around in a red dress with a slit up the side. Her face and expressions are magnificent.The story itself and the delivery (sets, etc.) ring of brilliance. This is sci-fi of the highest order.The film features a cool eerie score highlighted by some rocking nu-metal acts.NEGATIVES:Although ""Resident Evil"" is original in many ways it's sometimes reminiscent of other films like ""Aliens"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"". Hence, some things are predictable; for instance, you know anyone who gets bitten by a zombie is gonna eventually turn into one.To be expected, the mystery build-up in the first hour is better than the last half hour, which is action-filled. Why? Mindless action with numerous quick edits somehow always becomes boring. Wouldn't it be great if a sci-fi-horror film like this ended in a truly unconventional blow-your-mind way (like the original ""Planet of the Apes"")? But the final sequence makes up for it, sort of. Besides, since the film is based on a video game the slaughter comes with the territory.The film runs 95 minutes before the credits roll.PERSONAL GRADE: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

There were just too much illogical behavior, sloppy acting and derivative ideas that the original promise fell apart. This continued throughout the movie, so that towards the end I pretty much hated it.Some nice visual touches and an interesting premise, but all the movies it rips off -- Aliens, the Romero zombie trilogy, Outbreak, The Relic, etc -- are better than this, which adds to the exploitation feeling.

A mixed bag,"This movie is a bit hard for me to review, because for one I am a fan of the first Resident Evil games, and second because even though this movie is often seen as a very mediocre movie and overall adaption of the game, it is still much better then the second movie Resident Evil: Apocalypse.The acting in this movie is poor, but its the kind of acting that is so bad its good. Even though Milla Jovovich has the looks, she is just not a convincing actor at all. Michelle Rodriguez's part also doesn't work that well either, but I have to admit that both of them do deliver some good action-scenes.The music in this movie is also something I have mixed feelings about. Its composed in cooperation with shock-rocker Marilyn Manson. The score sounds very industrial and cold, which adds a very eerie vibe to the movie. But in some places the music is way too loud. I first watched this movie in the theater and I kid you not when I say that the industrial rock soundtrack is deafening at some parts. But I have to say that it does fit the movie's atmosphere well.The story is about your average zombie-outbreak, but instead of it taking place on the street or in a mall its taking place in a underground laboratory. Nothing too special, but it works.If you are a fan of zombie-movies then you should definitely give Resident Evil a try, its certainly worth watching at least once.

It's created a mood all its own with a futuristic ambiance, a tough but tender lead actress role (Milla Jovovich) and non-stop action, suspense, plot twists and a show of innovative ways to get killed by zombies and in other dangerous situations (don't want to give too much away).For those of us who have played the RE games, this movie provided a nice background, a sort of prequel and more depth to what was going on in the game and the reasons behind it. For anyone who hasn't played the video game, this movie is an excellent stand-alone horror sci-fi flick that is sure to become a classic and that does a good job of keeping your eyes glued to the screen and your heart thumping while you wonder what the poor characters will have to face next.I would give it a 10 in the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Surpassed my expectations,"I had to admit that I was a bit concerned about the whole super-computer element of the script, but I think that the movie came off rather nicely.The movie does deviate a bit from the games. However, I don't think that fans of the game will be disappointed with what they see. Many of the major ""dead"" characters are in the movie. I generally like the set of (living) characters. However, Michelle Rodriquez is _very_ one-dimensional as the pouty I-got-beat-up-by-my-older-brothers-a-lot-and-if-you-mess-with-me-I'll-teach- you-the-meaning-of-the-word-pain soldier. I liked Milla's character a lot, and I think Milla does a great job.The movie is usually very claustrophobic which I think is one reason I really liked it. Anderson makes great use of cluttered closed-in spaces. I don't think the movie is particularly scary, but with how tight the sets are, I think it adds to the anxiety of the situation. There's very few options when something comes down on your head.The biggest flaw I have with the movie is the music. It sucks. I like loud music as much as the next person, but I think it is just too loud and takes away from the movie. It turns into a stupid MTV video. I think the music could have added a lot to the creepiness of the film... very minimalistic stuff... but as soon as any action happens, it turns into a stinking SlipKnot album. I don't know what the best option would have been, but I think the music could have been done better.Anyway, on the whole, a very good effort.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Far Better than most Action Movies,"This movie succeeds in two of the hardest tasks out there: To make a good action movie AND to make a good movie out of a video-game. Fast, modern and very well directed, Resident Evil is fun and smart. It´s no masterpiece, of course, since it´s focused on action and adventure. Therefore, it presents a convincing and unpredictable plot, what´s indeed rare in this genre. Milla Jovovich is great as an action actress. Perhaps she finally found her ground in movie-making.

I am a 30 year old male, and when I first started playing RE I would avoid playing the games at night...cause...well...I'm sure you get the picture.  The movie had nearly none of that terror or suspense.  Sure, there was some parts but on the whole it was a little dissappointing.  I would have preferred that the movie stay in either the urban areas of Racoon City (ie., RE2, RE3), instead of the movie created ""Hive"".

Where's the GORE!!!!!!,I just went to see this movie and it was ok...it had it's moments. Some parts were truly great if they didn't have to be edited. Which I don't understand because Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead were a hell of a lot more gorier than this film...and actually a lot better. While I thought this movie was great it could have been truly horrifying. Milla was awesome...but she seemed kinda lost or maybe it was supposed to look that way. But anyway if you want an action packed ride with a few scares thrown in this one is for you. If you are a gorehound then you will be disappointed. I hope that when the DVD comes out they restore some of the cut scenes.

Hence it killed everyone down there instead of those usual movie which will at least left one survivor.This movie was very exciting. It gives us a feeling of horror too. This is especially applied to the scene in which the dogs appeared, same to the zombies. The design of the zombies characters and appearance had reached a high standard. I just love the way they bite peoples' flesh away. However, the story plot were confusing and had pulled down the standard of this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Cool idea, but poorly executed. The script is boring.","The basic idea for this movie is pretty cool, and visually the movie is engaging. Unfortunately, it looks like they spent all their money on visual effects and creating a cool look, and nothing on the script. One of the basic rules of story telling is show, don't tell. Most of scenes involve the characters standing around explaining to each other (i.e. explaining to us in the audience) what is happening. This makes the story move incredibly slow.The most interesting part of the story is how Alice (Milla Jovovich) has lost her memory. She knows that she's directly involved somehow, but doesn't know what she's done. Unfortunately she never reveals much about herself, so we don't get to know her enough to care about her. There are a couple of very awkward partial nude scenes that look painfully like the producers wanted to show Jovovich naked and she wouldn't play ball.This one really isn't worth the effort. The action scenes are few and far between, and aren't very well done. The story is so painfully slow that it seems to take forever to get started, and never really delivers enough energy to put you on the edge of your seat. It's really a shame because there are some very cool plot elements to the story, but it's just so poorly written that you're left wondering what this movie could have been if it had been given to a capable writer.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting remake from a classic movie!,"Excellent remake from an all-time horror classic 'Night of the living dead'.The movie very deliberately re-creates the horrified and depressing tensions apparent in its predecessor(the aforementioned film). In spite of that it's actually more science-fiction and action-oriented than horror.Don't remember did the director of original classic participate in making of this or not, but the aspects from tension between good and dark side of human nature are all there (under the action-style mainline). Racial conflicts are not so apparent in this, in fact characters all in all are just there to decorate the story (allthough the action and plot of the movie actually begins from Milla Jovovich appearance).There's naturally a lot similarities to other(later) films than NOTLD. For example the main plot about rescue team resembles Aliens movies (especially the 2nd, but others too...) Computerized cameras and views remind me somehow from Terminator films and of course, because movie is based on a game, there's a bit of tension from game-like storytelling. Haven't played the game though, cannot say how much there's similarity.One more aspect to mention is the 'music'(or sound scape) in film which is mostly from 90's ambient and something like techno-metal effects (it might have inspired from the game actually?). It very cleverly builds excitement in crucial moments.All in all, this must be one of the best (not many are worth mentioning) scifi-horror oriented films from 90's/2000. Also, I suppose it could be one of the few really good(if not only one?) movies based on PC-game. There's a lot needles violence and blood as in this kind films usually do, but not too much to spoil the excitement of the plot...",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Reviewing after watching welcome to raccoon city.,"Going back to its release all those years ago as a preteen, this movie was strictly mildly for a better term ""based"" on the games as a whole, what came after were a series that went from great to average, that was my opinion until i saw welcome to raccoon city, the director did a better job, he made a new character with cameos from characters from the games throughout the series. Welcome to raccoon city was basically as id describe a ""dumpster fire ""
Basically what im trying to say is, this movie along with apocalypse is the cleanest youll ever get to a resident evil film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Special Effects and a Big Budget do not a horror movie make,"As a fan of the horror genre and of the Resident Evil video game series I was looking forward to the theatrical adaption. However after viewing the movie I can only mourn what could have been. The majority of the movie is seen without the presence of any monsters and the ones that show up are few in number. One Licker a single pack of Cerberus zombie dogs and a few dozen Zombies, does little to impress this viewer. There is little character development and the performances themselves are hardly commendable. As for the amount of gore or in this case the lack there of it greatly hinders the movie itself. For an R rated horror movie this film had a serious lack in carnage and bloodshed. And if the title of Resident Evil is to be used the movie using it needs to have a certain quotient of violence and gore this film does not. In the end we have a movie with a big budget and fancy special effects that fail to cover up the fact that this is one lightweight horror movie. Not recomended at all",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Usually video game movies suck but this one was an alright horror film,"Paul W.S Anderson the man behind the Mortal Combat movies made this video game into a very decent horror/zombie film.I heard originally they had asked George A Romero ( The Godfather of Zombie films) to script this and direct this version and honestly as a horror film fan of both mainstream and independent horror films I feel this movie would've been less action film and more horrific if Mr Romero had written the screenplay and directed this film and it would've been more to my liking. However,MR Anderson did do a very good job at keeping this film suspenseful (though at times the filiming background is so dark you can barely see what is going on ) and the gore could have been a little more excessive especially considering this is a Zombie movie but for a mainstream film it was decently gory. Milla Jojovovich was very good as the films heroine and looked kick ass in her evening gown battle-dress and Michelle Rodriguez is hilarious as the overly tough girl character. It stayed as true to the videos game plot as it could and that actually worked well for the film. I have to say i'm actually looking forward to the sequel and am just glad that the Zombie genere has been brought back as after watching countless bad awful Italian zombie films I'm glad that my favorite horror genere is back in some form at least,as it doesn't look like Mr Romero has any plans to do a 4th Living Dead film and the only other talk that Hollywood has is its to  remake the classics that Mr Romero has already done and in my opinion shouldn't be reamde.There are classic horror films.LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!!!!!! but I beleive the sequel to Resident Evil will be sonething to look forward to in the summer of 2004 as will be the much anticipated sequel to Ginger Snaps as well. My only request is please make Resident Evil 2 more gorier and show more of the Nemesis monster as the computer-animated creature in Resident Evil was awesome looking ( and I usually hate computer-aniimated monster as they usually look so FAKE!!) .If you love Zombie films and ahve never seen one start off renting the Living Dead sereis then move on to Lucio Fulci 's classic 1980 fiolm Zombie then check out the underrated 1971 classic Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things , then check out the Resident Evil film. **** out of *****",,Anonymous,Horror
Semi-Entertaining action movie,"Overall ""Resident Evil"" is way above average as far as video-game to silver screen goes, however the movie itself only provides enough entertainment to cover you watching it maybe 2 or 3 times after that the movie becomes kinda boring.The first thing you'll notice about this movie (if you have played the games, but also if you havn't) that this isn't scary, at all. It is an action movie with a touch of gore now and again. There's a few cheap thrills which manage to make your heart jump for a second, but beyond that this movie has more in common with something like ""Aliens"" than ""Night of the Living Dead"". The script is mediocre, better than Romero's but still filled with wasted potential. The acting again is mediocre. In places this movie does get kinda stupid. The dog sequence comes to mind where she manages to kill 5 or 6 zombie dogs with one bullet each.The zombie sequences potential for some heavy action and gory scenes were again wasted as 4 of the team going into the hive to find out what happened are killed straight away by the Red Queen which means the film has to be more conservative with who lives and dies later on in the movie. Those characters went to waste in my opinion. The use of the Red Queen in the movie removes any horror elements remaining in the movie concerning the unknown of exactly what has happened as the Red Queen explains it all. There is in fact little or no atmosphere maintained in the movie, no where do you feel anxious or claustrophobic , and by no means does this movie inspire dread.All in all a below average action movie that tries to be something it isn't and disappointing for the game fans.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty good for what it is.,"Resident Evil is an action movie dressed up as a zombie horror flick. It has pretensions to being in the same gory category as George Romero's classic Day of the Dead.  In fact Romero was originally slated to direct Resident Evil. He left the production and a fellow named Paul Anderson took over. They made the right choice.  Anderson made a nifty joy ride of a movie with nothing in its brainless little head than to help you waste ninety minutes.Resident Evil is the type of movie where momentum trumps plot. This is not to say that story is unimportant. You need enough substance to involve the audience in the mayhem but not so much that they will accidentally start thinking. This movie has just enough characterization to make you worry about the fate of the actors and just enough plot to give them something to do.  Something goes `Horribly WrongT' at a vast underground biological research facility. All the lab personnel die and provide a pool of hungry zombies.  A crack paramilitary commando squad goes in to find out what happened.  That's about it for the plot.  That's all you need, really, to string the action sequences together.  Okay, yes, there are some subplots involving corporate espionage, love and betrayal but most of that just gets lost in the noise.  All you have to know to enjoy the proceedings is that the good guys have to go from point A to point B without becoming hors-de-oeuvres.The acting rises to the occasion but not much farther.  A fellow named Colin Salmon does look like he's destined for better stuff.  Salmon plays the head commando and manages to stand out in his brief screen time. Milla Jovovich, on the other hand, never seems anything more than the glamour puss she really is.  Not that she gets much help from the script or costume department.  Now bear in mind that these zombies are suppose to be highly contagious. One scratch and you're a shambling mess. Ms. Jovovich, supposedly a highly trained security expert, goes into battle wearing a spaghetti-strapped purple mini dress. I suppose the thigh high Doc Martins provided some protection but still.anyway, Jovovich has a likable screen presence and does the requisite kickboxing moves with passable flair.Michelle Rodriguez, now, looks as if she knows one end of an Uzi from another. She does go into battle wearing Kevlar but the ancient rules of dramaturgy being what they are; she eventually takes it off so we can see her t-shirt. To be fair, Rodriguez does a good job.  She shows more personality than Jovovich and is believable in a highly contrived situation.Despite the zombies you can watch Resident Evil without gagging on your popcorn.  Gore is not Resident Evil's bag. The zombies here are a civilized lot. They do their feeding politely off camera. Yes, there is plenty of blood being splattered around but not much more than you'd see in your average Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.Resident Evil is one of those borderline movies that are fun to watch but don't bear much discussion.  Should you see it?  Well, if your favorite movie of the last ten years was Room With A View then there are other films you should see.  If you're in the mood for a swiftly paced, brainless action flick however, then you can't go wrong with Resident Evil.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Resident Evil might look like an ordinary 21 century action/horror, but there's more to it than you'd ever expect!","When I saw the trailer to the Resident Evil movie, I actually became a little bit disappointed. It didn't seem to have much with the different video games to do. Except for the original plot ""An evil company, releases a massive virus which turns humans into living dead"".Though now, after I've seen it, I'm really surprised with the amount of places and objects you find simular with the objects and places of the different games. Even some scenes seems to be taken from the Games. As for me, who have played all of the games, that is very amusing. Still Resident Evil isn't just a good movie based on some video games.My words are simple. Resident Evil might look like an ordinary 21 century action/horror,but there's more to it than you'd ever expect. The Story is so intense and the actors are really doing a great job, including the Zombie actors. It was a long time ago we've got a really good Zombie movie, but now we are liberated. :DTo finalize it all, I will rate it. Really I would like to give it 10/10, but there's something that gave me the feeling om incompleteness. It is indeed a superb film, but they could've at least given us 40 minutes more of Zombies and terror.

Can you imagine a movie character on his own wandering around a spooky mansion looking for keys and other various pieces of treasure, it just wouldn't work.

A miltary team from the corporation is sent in to disable the computer and find out what happened to everyone.  Along the way we find out that the virus also turns its hosts into zombies.

Possibly the worst attempt at the horror genre.,"I honestly believe that Paul Anderson thinks adding heavy metal music to a zombie-littered action sequence will somehow improve the genre of 'horror'. What he fails to see is that Resident Evil in all aspects *should* be regarded as a horror film (with elements of action.) What he has managed to create is some obscene attempt at all-out action (involving horror elements.) What could possibly go wrong with that? Well, in all honesty; horror isn't scary with some teenage metal band pounding your ears whilst a plague of zombies fills the screen, looking very unimpressive. Where's the atmosphere? Play the video game - you get bucket-loads; so why isn't that reflected in the film? I was very disappointed that the film is obviously aimed at the male 15-18 teenage-angst market, although I guess that's to be expected, as it is a videogame. Overall, tedium... unless you're into loud shouty heavy music interrupting a (quite stylistically) shot movie. Just hope he doesn't **** it up with Alien versus Predator... Yet that will be aimed at the same market. Gah! Still, nothing can be as bad as Mortal Kombat... How could a person who made something as stunningly tense and atmospheric as Event Horizon make trite like MK and Resident Evil?I voted this film as a 1-star.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice Video Game to Movie Translation,"Having seen just about all video game to movie translations, I was hesitant on seeing this movie.  It's apparently not that hard for Hollywood to mess up making movies based on video games (i.e Super Mario Bros., Double Dragon, Street Fighter, Final Fantasy, etc...).  But I must say I was greatly pleased with the outcome.  Resident Evil is loosely based on the first game of the popular franchise of games.  It sort of takes place between part one and two.  The acting is not Oscar worthy by any means, but it is not supposed to be.  What Resident Evil comes down to is that it is a great horror movie with plenty of gore (gotta LOVE that scene with the room full of lasers!!!), scary moments and even a little nudity thrown in for good measure.  The soundtrack kicks major butt as well.  Paul Anderson did a great job (he also directed Mortal Kombat, one of the few actual good video game movies) and I hope he does as well with the sequel due next Summer. If you're a fan of the games or just a good horror flick, give this a shot.Overall:  8.2 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""You are all going to die down here.""","We've had movies based on books, based on the Bible, based comic books, based on songs, and ever since the mid 1990s, movies based on video games. Resident Evil is based on a video game, but probably could have been based on a night of heavy drinking and watching ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Night of the Living Dead,"" one after another. In Resident Evil, an evil bio-research company, called Umbrella Corp, or something silly like that, manufactured a virus that brings the dead back to life and causes them to want to eat other people. The standard horror movie rules apply, if someone is bitten by a zombie, they will become a zombie, zombies can only be killed after certain parameters occur (almost always where something is severed), and the girl with the most revealing dress and the biggest boobs will be the de-facto hero of the film. Milla Jovovich plays Alice who wants to steal the virus to somehow protect the world from it gets caught up in the building where the virus is stored has a security breach, and that causes all heck to break loose. This is where HAL 9000 takes over, errr, rather ""Red Queen"" takes over, as the computer has to shut down the building to make sure the virus does not escape, and will do anything to make sure it doesn't happen. Some computer rebooting occurs, yada yada, and by the end of the film, only 1 or 2 of the people who were in the building at the beginning are alive by the end. The movie is directed by Paul Anderson, who also directed ""Alien vs. Predator,"" so action scenes are to be expected. Some of the action sequences are so dark, so frantically edited, that while the scenes convey ""chaos,"" the message is lost in the inability to figure out what is going on. I would tell you who the men actors were, except they all look alike, so I couldn't tell who was who, they all had the same height, same haircut, one guy wore a blue shirt, but most of the others were even dressed alike. I know there is only one casting list out there anymore, but this is ridiculous. Not the worst film I have ever seen, but after seeing it, I have to wonder why they felt compelled to make a sequel. I for one have not heard about ""Resident Evil Mania"" out there.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
The dead walk the earth again!,"First of all: this is no George A. Romero film. That means, do not expect overly digging in people's intestines. Also, don't look for political metaphores or an indictment of bio-genetic sciences. It's just a classic PC-Game transferred onto the big screens. And for that, ""Resident Evil"" is one hell of a movie!So, what could you expect when Paul W.S. Anderson went on filming this picture? Here's a director who is not really known for his cineastic masterpieces. Also, the script strictly hangs on to ""Alien""-regulations. But for once, Mr. Anderson manages to prevail. The plot screams for action, not for significance or character development. From the first moment, the movie is just pure adrenalin.Both Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, are known as talented and attractive actresses. They don't have to prove anything, so they don't start doing Shakespeare where no overly acting is required. You just feel, that they had much fun during the shooting, and they operate excellent, with Rodriguez as the Vasquez-like exterminatrice and Jovovich as Alice, left in a nightmarish wonderland. Besides, they both are refreshingly sexy!When I saw the movie in my favourite cinema in Berlin, it had the whole audience at the edge of their seats from the first scene. I'm pleased that all the scary scenes work without too much brain ripping and blood spilling. It's a straight and entertaining horror-movie, with a music score that is just a bit too extreme.

Outbreak Origins,"Resident Evil is an action-packed, guilty pleasure that offers a unique spin on the beloved video game series while carving out its own cinematic identity. Directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, the film captures the essence of the franchise-bioengineered threats, the infamous T-virus, and a claustrophobic fight for survival-while crafting a narrative that stands apart from the games.Milla Jovovich shines as Alice, a character created specifically for the film. Her amnesiac journey through the Umbrella Corporation's underground facility provides a compelling focal point, blending mystery with high-octane action. Jovovich's portrayal imbues Alice with both vulnerability and strength, setting the stage for her transformation into an iconic action heroine. The film's setting-the sprawling and eerie Hive facility-serves as a perfect backdrop for the chaos, with its cold, clinical design heightening the tension.What makes Resident Evil enjoyable is its ability to adapt the video game's elements into an accessible and thrilling cinematic experience. Fans will appreciate the inclusion of zombies, mutated creatures, and the infamous Red Queen AI, while newcomers can dive into the story without needing prior knowledge of the games. The film delivers a mix of tension and spectacle, with memorable sequences like the laser corridor scene becoming instant highlights.However, the film isn't without its flaws. The plot leans heavily on action over depth, and the character development takes a backseat to the fast-paced narrative. While the story provides enough to keep viewers engaged, it lacks the complexity and atmosphere of the original games. Additionally, some of the dialogue and character interactions feel clichéd, which might detract from the overall experience for more critical audiences.Despite its shortcomings, Resident Evil succeeds as an entertaining adaptation that stays true to the spirit of its source material while charting its own path. It's not a faithful retelling of the games, but it captures their essence in a way that makes it a fun, standalone experience.In summary, Resident Evil is an energetic, visually engaging horror-action film that appeals to fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. While it doesn't delve deeply into its characters or themes, it delivers enough thrills, tension, and memorable moments to make it a worthwhile watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's pure escapism, and it's fun to watch.I have to hand it to the creative team behind this one, as it cooks up new and creative ways to kill people.

Pretty Good,"Resident Evil was about as good as could be expected from a video game genre.  The idea of having a Resident Evil movie was really exciting to me as a lover of Resident Evil 2's action and horror elements.  The movie adapted these elements fairly well with movie style and the video game's idea.  However, there was something about it that left you wanting maybe a little MORE of the video game's magic.  Maybe more blood.  Maybe more surprises.  I personally think the 2nd one will be much better.  That is if it picks up where the first left off.  Because I loved walking through that alley and being freaked out by the things that would pop up.  Most of them were zombies but some of them were dogs and assorted evils.

"Violent fun, often mindless even in direction, but stylish without the silly flair of future installments, and enjoyable","I'll start off by saying that, while I am very familiar with the video game series, I'm no diehard fan. That said, I do recognize the sort of ""treason"" in play, making a movie adaptation and featuring not a single character from the games. Instead they go with a fabricated character, Alice, and from the second movie spawn this whole clone-with-magic-powers story arc. Before all of that, however, was this - ground zero. There are still homages to the first 2 games, some more obvious than others, but as a straightforward zombie action flick, it satisfies. Plus, I gotta say, especially as a teenager when I first ""fell in love with"" this flick, the characters - cliche and averagely acted as they are - each have very entertaining moments. Michelle Rodriguez and James Purefoy were favorites, although I've come to love Milla Jovovich too, who in this installment exercises her versatility in playing a helpless civilian to a major badass, all without being too over the top as the sequels were. Plus the ""evolving"" Licker, a great enemy from the games, was incorporated very well in my opinion, teasing it throughout until its final revelation, a delightful mix of practical effects and CGI. No, thisovie is far from the ideal video game adaptation, but hey, it was fun for me as an action flick with some charisma.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Continuallyhitting that dead horse(no pun intended) has become very boringfor the viewers. Anderson managed to get all you can fromJovovich. The other actors fell under the old Star Trek philosophy,(If you aint seen 'em before, there going to die, has anyone elseEVER seen these people in ANYTHING?) so I guess flushing outthere characters would of been a waste of time.

But the biggest surprise about Resident Evil was that it was actually a pretty good movie.It wasn't all that suspenseful, but one of its many virtues is that it never talked down to the audience.

Silly,"One would think Hollywood would have learned by now that transferring a video game to the big screen simply does not work.  We've seen dissapointments ranging from dull (Final Fantasy, Tomb Radier) to utterly horrible (Mario Bros., Street Fighter).  I will concede that I found the original Mortal Kombat somewhat entertaining.  There is, however, absolutely no saving grace for this sorry excuse for a movie.  The acting is bad, the story seems thrown together, and did I mention the acting was bad?  Oh, I almost forgot, thanks to this movie, we now have a scientific explanation for zombies!  Come on, Hollywood!  I suppose next you'll tell us that The Force is really just a bunch of cells inside the body.If you want a good laugh, try to borror it from a friend who might have been tricked into buying this movie.

One of the better zombie movies,"Based on the popular video game (they made a couple of comics too) this movie is just what the doctor ordered for us Zombie flick fans.A secret Umbrella Corporation research facility becomes infected with a virus it was developing and the computerised security system sealed it off completely, leaving the present staff to die while exposed to the virus.Since nobody knows what went wrong, a SWAT-type team is sent in to investigate. On their way in they run into Alice (Milla Jovovich) and Spence Parks. They guard the entrance to the facility and were rendered unconcious by the security system and as a result of which suffer some memory loss. Also tagging along is cop Matt Addison who just happened to be there when the team arrived.They get in, run into lots and lots of nasties and need to get out in one piece. There's a few plot twists in there to keep things entertaining for people looking for a nice story, and for the hormone-driven males there's a couple of nice partial nudity shots of lovely Milla. It doesn't get in the way of the action though, and there's plenty of that.The biggest flaw in the story is when the lasers come into play. The last type of laser used is the most effective, and it makes you wonder why the security system didn't use it immediately and get it over with. The rest of the story is solid as far as I can tell, and pretty much in sync with the game.Now, as I said this is a very good zombie movie. There's a lot of them, and the special effects budget was well spent using mainly make-up effects, and saving the big bucks for the biggest nasty of them all (a 'licker', to those familiar with the game) which is played by the computer.There's practically no gore in the movie. Sure, there's the bruises and wounds a zombie is likely to inflict, but no zooming in on it, or excessive blood squirts. I actually counted a total of one scene I would consider somewhat gory (when they reach the train on the way out), and it wasn't that bad.The acting by most of the credited cast was okay. The zombies on the other hand were excellent. Normally they disappoint by trying too hard to act somewhat dead or by standing still while clawing at a character. In this movie they do what you expect them to do and do it well.I'm giving this one an 8 out of 10. If you're into zombie movies (and I am in a BIG way) it's highly recommended. If you're just looking for some good scares, this movie delivers. Go see it. You will not be disappointed.",,Anonymous,Horror

Finally....,"This is the very first time I have seen someone take a video game and do a good job of turning it into a movie. Excellently done. The critics I see carping about the lack of originality just don't get it. I saw one of them say something about zombies not as good as ""Night of the Living Dead"" and a train not as big as ""Ghosts of Mars."" Doesn't he get it? The zombies were pretty much exactly as they were the game -shambling, shuffling along until they are close enough to attack, and then diving in for that bite! The train, of course, was lifted pretty much exactly from the game. They weren't trying for a ""Ghosts of Mars"" type thing.Milla was amazing. I read another review that claimed ""Tomb Raider"" would be considered a better movie because it had a higher babe factor. Well yes, Angelina Jolie is a babe, but guess what, so is Milla. And the story line was a heck of a lot better than ""Tomb Raider."" It had a point, was internally consistent, and a great setup for the start of the game.In case you're unsure of my point, I heartily approve. Great job with the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

big budget zombie adventure,"Video game makers are mostly influenced by classic stories to give their games shape.  So, it's no wonder that RESIDENT EVIL has lots of hints to and ideas taken from for example Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD.  I would even dare to mention that there wouldn't be a RESIDENT EVIL if Romero didn't make his zombie trilogy!  But also new films are recognized in some scenes, like for example the scene with the lazer beams is totally taken from THE CUBE (which was pretty good by the way). RE has a bit more action over the whole line, but doesn't have the psychology that goes on in Romero films, neither does it create a tension or a feel with the characters.  It also doesn't have the gore that zombie films supposed to have.  The effects are smooth, yet there's not much blood spilled for a zombie flick.  Best example from this is the first scene in the elevator: we don't see her head fall off. Through the whole movie you are waiting for something to come, they try to build up tension and you are left behind with nothing.The plot (thank you Romero) tries to be high-tech, but it's obvious it's just dragged into the film for little reason, but to give us a falls feeling of intelligent action. RESIDENT EVIL was a total let down and was even worse then I expected.  And then I'm not even talking about the killer bunny...--- FOR GAMERS ONLY ---",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"blood, spatter, BORE","to think of this film as being a horror movie is a gross miscarriage of justice. this is more an action-adventure movie than anything and has nothing to with horror at all. on top of it, this isn't related in any way to the excellent video game on which this movie is based on, other than the t-virus and the undead featured in the game.Resident evil blatantly rips off everything from Cube to Warning Sign to even Event Horizon and Alice in Wonderland.speaking of which, the movie also references Stanley Kubrick's 2001: the homicidal computer The Red Queen is a clear take on HAL.i tried to feel scared throughout the movie, but there was nothing to make me feel scared.the zombies were rather pitiful, resembling disease-ridden victims. the licker was really, really tacky. the director should have substituted the licker for maybe the Tyrant from the first game or the Leech Queen in Code:Veronica.despite its shortcomings, RE is a decent action movie that demands repeated viewing.i got the DVD for Christmas, and i enjoyed watching the movie much to my surprise.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's got a beat you can dance to,"The soundtrack is the most attractive element of the movie. It fits the screenplay very well. Jovovich is easy on the eyes and she has an expressive face that keeps you interested in her. The rest of the cast is fair to good; no crummy acting at least. Some settings are appropriately creepy. It does run down into a 'kill all zombies' movie, the plot could've used a few more minutes developing the mostly fictional science, and there were some lack of continuity in the scene transitions. Still Resident Evil worth watching if you don't mind blood and guts. I learned, for instance, never to stick my head out of a stuck elevator.

That said, I still think the acting is quite good all around, especially considering the story they had to work with. The characters simply come over as believable. It's like everybody believe in the universe that is the essence of the story, which makes it real, even if is not deep personality that is explored here. The above together with some really good graphics and picture effects makes it a movie worth seeing. As for the thriller part some of the scenes and effects were quite shocking - in a good sense.

Got the looks but not the intelligence,"Resident Evil, the latest film from Paul Anderson--not to be confused with a much better filmmaker, Paul Thomas Anderson--looks great enough, but it feels like a feature-length compilation of familiar scenes from a handful of superior horror and/or sci-fi films, e.g. George Romero's zombie flicks, the ""Alien"" films, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, and The Matrix. The film doesn't break any new grounds and would have been better served, I think, as a ""direct to video"" release. The film features the beautiful Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element, The Claim) who, along with several others (most notably, Michelle Rodriguez from The Fast and the Furious and Girlfight), must contain a chemical leakage at one of those secret underground laboratories which you find from time to time in sci-fi films like this. Unbeknownst to this crew, the contamination has turned all the workers in the lab into ""zombies,"" a group of walking dead who are driven solely by the instinct to feed on living flesh. As you might have expected, the crew has to fight off the zombies, resulting in plenty of carnage and gore. Resident Evil is a gory film. What the film lacks, however, is any real suspense or genuine scares. And the soundtrack is one of the loudest I have heard in a long time; I wasn't scared by the film, but several times I got scared that I might go deaf. (I guess the philosophy behind this tactic is: if you can't scare them, jolt them.) I should also mention that the film features several almost nude scenes of Jovovich which are sort of disappointing and anti-climactic (you sort of keep wishing that the damn towel, etc. would fall, but it never does) but might turn out, in the long run, to be the best part of this dead-brained film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A good start,"Honestly, this was a great start to a movie series. It delivered everything you'd expect: action, blood, mystery, and a deadly virus. What more could you ask for? The protagonist is cool and fits well into the story, though I feel like she could've had a bit more personality to make her stand out. The supporting characters are solid, and their dynamics work well within the context of the film.The ending ties things up nicely while still leaving room for a sequel. Overall, the movie maintains a consistent level of quality throughout. However, while it's good, it's not extraordinary. It lacks that extra layer of suspense or emotion that could've made it exceptional. For example, there's not much of a connection with the characters on a deeper level - the tension feels surface-level rather than something that sticks with you.When you finish watching Resident Evil, you don't feel an overwhelming urge to immediately dive into the sequel. Instead, you're more likely to think, ""That was nice. Maybe I'll check out RE2 someday."" It's a decent film, entertaining enough for what it is, but it doesn't leave a lasting impression. Still, it's a solid foundation for the series and worth watching if you're into action-packed sci-fi horror.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not very much of a good adaption of the game, but impressive and good to see.","Well after the waiting, we finally get a Resident Evil movie at last, but not in the way we expected it to be. Sure, normally it would not be directly based on the games, so they would put something else instead to make it worthwhile to see. But what we get is something a little disappointing. It seems to tell a bit of a sensationalized story instead of the on in the game, and it seems to lack a bit of the horror and fun from the games, at least it still has the T-virus, I'm glad and thankful for that. And there are some STARS in it, and zombies, and dog zombies, and lickers, but it lacks the feel, it doesn't seem all that exciting, more of a generic zombie movie, doesn't even surpass the Dead trilogy. In other word it just doesn't have the spirit of the games. But despite all that, it's good to see it isn't like the other failed movies from video games, like Street Fighter, or Super Mario Bros, or Double Dragon, yuck!

The pace is energetic if not frantic. Plot twists and new details are not of the cheesy variety and are well integrated into the flow of the film.  No goofy, quirky characters or plotlines make this film a more serious and credible sci fi action film in the vein of Cameron's Aliens (if not quite as strong).What Resident Evil lacked and could have improved on is the more development and depth for the ""Resident Evil"" part itself.

"This Movie is just Evil, Not in a Good way!!","The makers of the games should be weeping on the keyboards right now, because one of the best video games in history has been turned into another cursed video game film (see also Double Dragon, and Mario Brothers).  Paul Anderson has taken a perfect shot at making a great film and ruined it with poor makeup and even poorer plot.  Number 1, i feel bad for George Romero (originaly slated for this film) for being dropped from this project, because he would have done a great job, because in the end Resident Evil is at its core a game about ZOMBIES, not super-computers.  Who knows zombies better than him???  Well after seeing this movie this wednesday at a sneek preview I can firmly say not Paul Anderson.Ideas from the game were kept, but they were re-worked into something perverted from the game, its as if the movie isnt about the game, but more about making people jump and trying to get a hip teen crowd.  Of which it is missing a key element to that thing which it trys to be...gore.  There is hardly any blood at all in a movie in which zombies are supposed to be eating the people.  Black Hawk Down had 4 times the gore this ""horror"" film did.  Even the game involves much more blood.  Dont get me wrong there is plenty of violence, and lots of 'splosions and guns, but there is no saving grace.  The most disappointing thing is the makeup and effects in the film. The zombies look just like normal people with a bad limp, barely any had any facial or body appliances to create effect of decay.  Some of the computer effects were laughable, and the main creature reminded me of the computer alien from Alien 3 in 1993 (not a good thing)! The acting is about as bad as the first game so thats the only thing close to staying true to the game.  Michelle Rodriguez contunies to be type cast as the snarling, tough female which she seems to excell with.  Even Milla Jovovich wastes her time trying to attempt to act through this one.  The rest of the cast is just kind of there, lucky them. In conclusion, ha i know ive rambled enough, if you are looking for a true survival horror film then rent something like John Carpenter's The Thing, but if you want to be throw into a world were the only survival horror youll have is to try and not walk out of the theater go see Resident Evil.

"Has a good idea, but wasn't nearly as good as it could've been.","I had been anticipating the movie Resident Evil since I heard to was to be released back in 1998. At the time there were various directors and writers attached to the project, even George A. Romero -- The Master of Zombie Flicks. However, if you read Romero's script which appeared online, most would agree it was a quite corny script that had no real development.So finally I heard in 2001 that Paul Anderson, who directed Mortal Kombat (and did a good job at that) would write/direct the project. And it was finally released March 2002. So here are my thoughts on the flick. His ideas for cutting away from the game by introducing a new story was a good idea... to leave some surprises for the gamers and non-gamers. However there were many problems in his script. The story is good because it keeps close to the idea of the corrupt Umbrella Corporation. However, character development and dialogue are the two biggest things wrong with the movie. Though the cast is minimal, there are only two interesting characters in the entire film. Milla Jovovich plays the mysterious ""Alice in Wonderland"" character who can't remember her identity. As the movie progresses, we learn more about her character, but never the entire thing (I'm sure it'll be answered in the sequel). However the problem with Jovovich's character is though she's mysterious, she's not very interesting. The only other character in the film that was interesting was One (played by Colin Salmon). Colin Salmon kicks ass as the elite group's leader. His dialogue is very well written, too. He basically explains the entire situation of what has happened, which is good because Salmon has a great, bold voice. It's very unfortunate that this movie follows all the other roots of 'horror' flicks and kills off the token black character early. So before we can even embrace Salmon's character, he is dead (an incidentally, dies in the sickest & coolest way possible).So with only one really interesting character who doesn't last long and another who isn't quite as interesting, this movie drags. However there is enough action-packed sequences in it to keep one entertained.OVERALL: 6 out of 10 (okay)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fair is fair, I have to admit that I left the movies with a reasonably good feeling. The first part of the film was catching and it was well on its way to become my all time favourite horror movie. Then it sort of went over the top. In trying to keep the attention of the audience they stretched the zombie action for to long and the climax with the mutated monster was greatly over-done.

Anderson, successfully brings the survival horror atmosphere to the big screen, offering a mix of suspenseful moments and action sequences. Milla Jovovich's performance as Alice adds a compelling and capable lead to the narrative. While the plot takes creative liberties with the game's storyline, it establishes its own identity within the Resident Evil universe. The film's visual effects contribute to the eerie atmosphere, and overall, it serves as an engaging introduction to the film franchise spawned from the popular gaming series.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Perfect example of ""commertial BAD movie""","I cannot believe as many people liked it as is. This movie was ... beyond believe bad. Perhaps it is my total dislike for zombie movies ... perhaps it was not, but... STOP MAKING BAD MOVIES HOLLYWOOD! thinks that were wrong 1) the action took place in totally uninteresting places.. At least make it pretty!!! old mansion. HALLO! 2)um. plot? is it there.. um. ok by the end it lurks around the corner. try having it in sooner 3) what the HELL is going on (my only thought the first hour 45 min) 4)ok so the filming was done well but what are they filming...(remember to get make up tips from 13 Ghosts next time) 5) the ending was quite cool except for the fact that it's only there to provide a bridge for the next Resident Evil movie which... what do you know!... is coming out in 2003 no less!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intense and Strangely Compelling,"8 August 2002. ""Resident Evil"" was more intelligent than ""Aliens,"" and the twist and turn in the movie was good. I'm not a fan of slasher/horror, and living dead movies, but I eventually settled into the movie with its scientific sounding rationale gunk. I was terrified (although not scared, as if there's a difference). I particularly liked how compassionate some of the scenes were, while the beginning indiscriminate killing was quite effective in setting the tone for the rest of the movie.It's really difficult to describe what it was about ""Resident Evil"" that made it stand out above the usual blood and gore movies. The touch of humanity, the computer logic, the seriousness of the military discipline? Somehow, all the parts seemed to work together. Milla as an actress did a great job with a number of different portraits of human behaviors and emotions. The script was a notch above the usual cut and slash. Somehow the ending even seemed apt and complete creating both the typical uneasy shucks reaction but at the same time yeah ok, I understand, a decent ending - serves you right.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
a disappointment for me,"Ok, this movie is well done and some people appreciate it quite a lot but I felt it just as a disappointment. Milla Jovovich is gorgeous and the zombies look good but the scenes involving them are not gory at all.I think Paul Anderson did a good job in ""Event Horizon"" and even in ""Soldier"" which was better than expected but here he uses a too much video-clip style and the movie was quite uninteresting. And there is another thing I cannot understand, if this movie was so little successful in the USA, why are thinking about making a sequel?At least I hope it is like the Video game, that is,a zombie flick more than this is: A mixed of a lot of things all together.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Perfect Mix!,"Regardless of whether or not you are a die hard Resident Evil fan, you'll love this movie.  There truly is nothing I can say bad about this movie...it has the perfect mix of great acting, special effects, and most importantly, sToRyLiNe!  I saw this movie a couple of days ago and haven't stopped raving about it since!  This will be in my DVD collection ASAP! In all fairness, I'm not upset that some didn't like it, but I can only guess someone wouldn't like this movie for two main reasons. 1)  If you worship the Resident Evil game series and feel that the movie should have followed the game more closely, and  2)  If you don't like this genre of movies entirely. (ie: Aliens, Dawn of the Dead, Event Horizon, etc)I'm even amazed at how thrilled I am with this movie but I am SUPER THRILLED!  Milla Jovovich does an awesome job as she's so versatile and beautiful she can conform to almost any movie role.  All in all, if you like zombie action movies and are willing to let the movie have some creative differences from the games, then you will absolutely LOVE this movie. Forget the title, it stands alone as one hell of an action/horror/sci-fi film.Have I said enough now?  ;) Can't wait for the sequel!  Go see Resident Evil today!!! ;)",,Anonymous,Horror
"Well, At least it's better than Tomb Raider.","I don't think that Video Games turns into movies are a good idea (All of them sucked so far) but this film was pretty ok. It does not have the creep factor of the video games but it does hold up in the scare department. While it did need a much better script to go by, the story here is decent. Hopefully, judging by the last scene of the film, the sequel should be much better.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Little intrigue, lots of opportunity missed.","Resident Evil undoubtedly works far better on the small screen than it did at the cinema. There is no way any director (no matter how experienced) can bring a video game to life without sacrificing art in the process. Anderson has been here before with Mortal Kombat but injected into both movies enough competency and style to make them respectable in their own right.With Resident Evil he has given us a decent story with a touch of complication and a fair amount of suspense. My main gripe is the fact that the movie looks far too slick to be as truly disturbing as the grainy and filthy Zombie movies of the '70s. Plus the violence isn't all that graphic but there is still plenty of fun to be had in watching a bunch of office workers turn into the living dead and it's scary how cheaply their lives are considered by the Umbrella Corp. they work for. I'm certainly not going to work in an office for a company like that if that's what they're going to do to me.The characters are thin but not entirely one-dimensional. You do end up siding with some of them and feel urgency in their futile escape from the underground skyscraper (shouldn't that be 'Groundscraper' then?). Milla Jovovich is cuter here than she was in Fifth Element or Zoolander but Michelle Rodriguez just plain annoys me. All I've ever seen her play is a moody Latino who frowns all the time. It's time for here to try and expand her range a bit and I wish someone else played her character.Video games will never make for classic movies. They can be mind-numbingly terrible (Super Mario Brothers, Double Dragon) or competent, such as this. Just turn a blind eye to the really, really bad FX at the end when a CGI monster goes on the rampage. My old Commodore 64 was capable of better graphics.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and a choice of Dolby 5.1 or DTS 5.1 soundtracks which sound great but, as a result, also serve to highlight he meaningless and clichéd Marco Beltrami/Marylin Manson 'score'.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An enjoyable,but completely unscary zombie romp!","""Resident Evil"" isn't definitely the worst horror film ever made,but movie of the year?!...come on!I'm sad to have say that this is actually more action flick than horror.As cool as the games are(at least the first two),as mediocre is Anderson's film.Almost no gore at all,pretty bad acting(the characters in the computer game almost seem lively)and no uncanny atmosphere to be found.And,by the way it's mostly kind of rip-off of ""Dawn of the Dead"".Still there are some enjoyable moments to be found here.There's one reasonably creepy sequence in the mansion near the beginning.The sequence where several characters are trapped in the bright,shiny corridor with a deadly laser beam is the highlight of the film and contains one of the coolest and most unexpected decapitations I've seen in awhile.The battle between Milla Jovovich and creepy dogs is also excellent.The climax is okay and it leaves the door wide open for a sequel.The film is well-made and looks really nice,but the lack of gore can't be forgiven.However there are better zombie movies with plenty of red stuff out there for example ""Zombi 2"",""Burial Ground"",""The Beyond"",Romero's ""Living Dead"" trilogy,""Flesheater"",""Meat Market"" series etc.The game is also a lot more scarier-if you want a really good,albeit forgotten horror film which is quite similar to the first ""Resident Evil"" game,please check out ""Scarecrows""(1988).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Suitably entertaining action-horror, if not fully satisfying in any regard","I worked in a video store when this first came out, and I watched it way back when. I've remembered very little about the movie after the fact (only small odds and ends), but I do remember enjoying it, if not being wholly swept away. I've been overdue to watch it again, and finally see the rest of the long-running series with Milla Jovovich. I think even as soon as it begins one can discern that 'Resident evil' doesn't represent the top of the line in any regard, and moreover it marks the beginning of the phase in Paul W. S. Anderson's career where he was concerned with a slick and cool presentation as much as (if not more than) earnest, impactful storytelling and thrills. Even a couple decades later it's still reasonably entertaining, though - something relatively light and frivolous, the type of fare one can ""watch"" without necessarily actively engaging.The abundant post-production special effects are less than seamless, and one always wishes more practical effects and tangible creations were employed, but the CGI is at least on-par for the early 2000s if not sharper than we saw among some contemporaries. Especially with that CGI in mind it's plainly apparent that far more than not the feature opts for churning out easy, outlandish violence, bloodshed, and death over fostering meaningful atmosphere or lasting chills and thrills; we see this even in the opening scene, in over the top muzzle flashes, in the way that zombies may fly back several feet after being shot, and so on. Then again, for better or worse that's kind of the norm when it comes to action-horror. In keeping with the bombast the cinematography and editing are sometimes overzealous; Anderson's direction is tight when it comes to action sequences, a contrast to those moments that are quieter, and which required acting over stunts, which Anderson just wasn't able to convincingly pull off (e.g., Michelle Rodriguez is all but slurring her words; Milla Jovovich is a deer in the headlights beyond what the script portends).One could never accuse 'Resident evil' of not knowing what it was, though. The overcharged, overcooked zest of action sequences (such as when Alice first realizes she has fighting skills) can be overbearing at times, but there's hardly any disputing that these bits are executed very well. The stunts, practical effects, and sets are all primed for an exciting romp; the actors are on fire, the original music of Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson is vibrant and flavorful, and the pacing and mere passing peeks at CGI are ably invigorating. In comparison, when the action dies down, the music is flaccid and bland, the acting is weak, the digital wizardry becomes more overt, the pacing flags, and plot development is a little middling. (Case in point, no one ever questions how Alice is suddenly useful.) All this is a tad strange, perhaps, since Anderson's earlier work 'Event Horizon' was a more sincere horror flick, yet if the skills he developed led to success first and foremost as an action filmmaker, one can't fault him for taking this 2002 extravaganza in that direction. Every scene that fills the gaps between stunts and violence rather seems like a stopgap to prepare for the next instance, and maybe recognition of that slant is the best manner in which to enjoy it.One way or another the picture is no exemplar. We get all the visuals and essential genre elements we want out of horror, but not so much the major feelings and visceral reactions; we get the highfalutin spectacle of the action film, tempered by excess and less sturdy storytelling; we get a plot that provides stable foundation for all the various flavors, but it receives the least care and attention in these 100 minutes. The result is that for the strength this can claim at its best, I want to like it much more than I do, and it deserves more respect; for the faults and shortcomings it bears in different fashions, it's only a hair above average, and the fun it offers falls on the more passive side of the spectrum. I do like 'Resident evil' when all is said and done, and in fact I think it's better than I remembered from twenty years ago. It's no must-see by any means, but if it's action-horror you want, it's action-horror you'll get, and it's a decent enough way to spend one's time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great movie, though nothing like the game","Deep under the ground of Raccoon City lies the hive, a secret facility run by the evil Umbrella Corporation. A secret bio-weapon known as the T-Virus is set free, turning everyone that dies into a zombie. This is a fantastic take on the game, though it barely resembles it. Instead of the title characters, we get Alice, who is far more bad-ass that Leon or Claire or Chris ever thought of being.

From Dusk Till The Ghosts of Mars,"""Resident Evil"" follows the all too familiar path of a couple other recent movies: ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""The Ghosts of Mars."" All three start with an interesting plot but end up just being about zombies instead. (Or vampires. Or whatever.) It's as if in all three cases the writers got bored halfway through and said ""Oh, heck. Let's just throw in some zombies.""  (Or vampires. Or whatever.)I don't mean to suggest that ""Resident Evil"" is terrible. It's okay. But the frustrating thing is that, like those other two movies, it could have been so much more.In fact, the initial plot is rather intriguing: We are set in a secret, underground facility where biological weapons are being created. But something has gone seriously wrong and the computer that controls the facility has started killing off the people who work there. Now an outside team must penetrate the facilities defenses and attempt to take control of the situation.And then...! And then...! Zombies!Milla Jovovich stars as a helpless female who needs protecting at first but soon becomes a tough chick with moves that would do Jackie Chan proud. Okay, her transformation is explained by a memory loss that is slowly regained, but it seems the producers wanted it both ways: Helpless and tough at the same time. Michelle Rodriguez is at least consistently the tough chick throughout. But her constant ""I'm tough, get out of my way"" routine gets old quickly.In fact, it is interesting that Rodriguez is second billed in this movie. This seems to be the case only because there was no one else to give second billing to. The male characters are all poorly drawn and very difficult to keep track of. I kept forgetting which one was supposed to be the bad guy.Sure, some of the action sequences will keep your interest. Milla's battle with some zombie dogs make the movie worth giving a chance if you have nothing better to do some evening. Still, the next time I decide to watch a zombie movie I think I will pick one that is a zombie movie all the way, and not one where the zombies were thrown in because the writers got bored.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The best one in the series, amazing horror sci-fi action flick based on a video game - my favorite!","Resident Evil (2002) is my favorite horror sci-fi action flick that is based on a video game and it is my second favorite film from Paul W. S. Anderson! It is favorite horror sci-fi action flick of mine and I love this film to death! By far one of the best horror films ever made! Milla Jovovich is a sexy actress and plays a perfect role for this movie. For 2002 the special effects are amazing and the acting was great. Definitely the best out of the three. I Wouldn't Say Its A Horror Movie, Yet I'm Not Saying Its Not. This (Along With Underworld, Van Helsing and More) Is a strange combination of Horror, Action, & Sci-Fi. If someone asked me what genre It is I would probably say Horror. Horror is supposed to scare you. This makes you say ""Holy Crap This Is Cool."" either way awesome movie.Plot: Alice (Milla Jovovich), a young woman who along with fellow survivors must find a way to escape a underground bio facility that is infested with zombies. The film would launch the Resident Evil film series.Something rotten is brewing beneath the industrial mecca known as Raccoon City. Unknown to its millions of residents, a huge underground bio engineering facility known as The Hive has accidentally unleashed the deadly and mutating T-virus, killing all of its employees. To contain the leak, the governing supercomputer, Red Queen, has sealed all entrances and exits. Now a team of highly-trained super commandos including Rain (Michelle Rodriguez - The Fast and the Furious, Girlfight), Alice (Milla Jovovich - The Fifth Element) and Matt (Eric Mabius - Cruel Intentions) must race to penetrate The Hive in order to isolate the T-virus before it overwhelms humanity. To do so, they must get past the Red Queen's deadly defenses, face the flesh-eating undead employees, fight killer mutant dogs and battle The Licker, a genetically mutated savage beast whose strength increases with each of its slain victims.""...Mila Jovovich is a first-rate action heroine.""This film has everything it is a zombie movie, about plague a deadly T-virus that infected its employees and turned them in to a bloody thirsty eating human zombies! It has deadly booby traps, killer mutant dogs, the Licker mutant zombie. The action is great, the horror in this movie is visually scary. Michelle Rodriguez from The Fast and the Furious is excellent I love her character Rain Ocampo she was a tough special forces commando soldier in this flick. But Mila Jovovich is a bad ass, she is so hot and sexy I am kind of jealous on Paul W.S. Anderson for having so sexy and beautiful heroine for his wife. I love this flick and I love the songs in this movie. We have Eric Mabius from The Crow: SalvationI love the songs for this movie: My Plague (New Abuse Mix) - by Slipknot and Invisible Wounds (Dark Bodies) by Fear Factory. The movie itself is very good, it's a zombie flick but as some others have stated, not retarded or boring, it's actually a great movie with not a lot that I need to complain about, good characters, action sequences, story, game-references, dialogue, suspense, etc....I don't think I need to say too much there.Overall: I am going to give this movie a 10 out of 10, this is the best one in the series and no sequel can overpass the original. What else can one say about the Resident Evil franchise: as far as basing a movie off of a video game, Resident Evil has to be one of the best adaptations ever. It keeps the broad strokes of the game intact while creating a new character, Alice, that everyone can instantly identify with. Milla Jovovich takes the action hero foundation she laid in The Fifth Element and builds on it to make herself perhaps the first female action superstar. I love this film to death and it is my favorite film in the franchise it is still a true horror film!Resident Evil is a 2002 science fiction action horror film written and directed by Paul W. S.

When will they learn?,"Okay, pay no attention to the 7.0 rating. If you have any good taste and think good movies have to have actual plots, actual characters, and some decent dialogue, do not see this movie, because it's horrible.The main actors in this movie have done much better work (Milla: 5th element, Michele: girlfight), and everyone else in the movie was pretty much just there to be killed or take up space. There weren't exactly charcters. I didn't even catch any of their names. There was hardly any dialogue except for the usual ""What is that?!"" or the pathetic comedic one liners from Michele. We learn absolutely nothing about the characters themself, because, once again they weren't characters.OK OK I know that's alot to expect from a video game adaption (is it though?). I mean, going into see this movie I was at least hoping for some decent zombie stuff to happen. But there was nothing! The zombies looked like people picked up off the street, covered in flour and ketchup and told to scream at milla jovovich. Even the computer generated thing that got out from it's cage, whatever it was, was pretty bad looking, not a memorable creature at all.So basically it all adds up to this: Pretty much everything in this movie has been done before AND better:Zombies: ""Dead Alive"", ""Evil Dead""; Butch Pretty Girl Heriones: ""Alien"", ""Terminater 2"";The Laser Sequence: ""Cube""; CGI Monsters: ""The Relic"", ""The Mummy"", ""Lord of the Rings"";Boring Characters (if you could call them that), Dull Plot, Bad Acting, Bad Editing, Bad Visual FX, Bad Dialogue... etc etc etc.HOWEVER I did like the dog sequence.

don't believe the (negative) hype...,"people had been bad-mouthing this movie before it was even released. it came out today, i saw it, and i thought it kicked a lot of ass. REALLY. years ago, director george romero was attatched to direct this film, but either he couldn't get it together or his script wasn't good enough and they decided not to go with him as director. as a longtime horror/zombie movie fan, let me just say that romero already put his stamp on material like this when he made DAY OF THE DEAD in the 80s (which has a lot in common with RESIDENT EVIL in terms of setting, atmosphere, characters, plot, and general tome) and there'd be no point in him directing this type of film again. that said, i think director paul anderson has done an incredible job directing this movie! it is tense, scary, unrelenting, and moves along at a perfect pace. his previous film SOLDIER (with kurt russell) is highly underrated, you should check it out. milla jovovich and michelle rodriguez are both wonderful in RESIDENT as well, i liked them both quite a bit. this is the first movie based on a video game that i actually enjoyed, and i hope it gets a sequel fast. my only complaint is the computer-generated effects, which get ridiculously overused (come on, zombies don't need CGI makeup, just call tom savini). perhaps with more $$$ this can be remedied if they make another...and anyone who sees this & likes it will be begging for part 2.",,Anonymous,Horror
Fun,"Director Paul Anderson has done two of my favorite films--""Mortal Kombat"" (I know it's based on a video game but I liked it) and ""Event Horizon"" (one of the most unsettling sci-fi/horror films ever). This movie (also based on a video game) isn't good as the other two. But for what it is, it's great.A virus is mistakenly (?) let loose in a huge underground city run by a corporation. It kills everyone there and a military squad is sent down to deactivate the central computer. But the computer is active, aware...and angry. Soon the squad is dealing with flesh-eating zombies, zombie dogs and a huge, scary, angry mutant.The plot is needlessly complex and convoluted and brings the movie to a screeching halt so characters can explain what's going on. Also this movie goes out of its way to show Milla Jovovich nude more than once. But still, I enjoyed this movie. The acting is OK except for Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez--they're both very attractive but are terrible actors--there blank faces and lousy dialogue readings got annoying. The male members of the cast were, on the other hand, very good. The special effects are stunning and the movie is very loud, very fast, very violent and FUN! The booming music score helps propel the movie along. Also it has more than its share of creepy moments (the voice of the computer spooked me for some reason--it's a little girls voice!).

Choppy Recycling,"""Resident Evil,"" an adaptation of a video game, is a bad movie in essentially every regard: hackneyed, simplistic scenario (evil corporation unleashing zombies), adulteration by association of classic literature in Lewis Carroll's Alice books, rudimentary acting, perfunctory dialogue, loud music for the sake of being loud, inept style, generic action scenes. Despite all of that, this may have been a more enjoyable action flick, at least on a so-bad-it's-good or guilty-pleasure level, if not for some atrociously choppy editing. The quick cuts to get around actors being substituted for stunt doubles or to otherwise conceal the fact that they can't physically do what their characters can is worse than usual. Alice's fight with the dogs is one of the worst examples. Moreover, these flimsy constructions being passed off as action scenes are cobbled together with unmotivated, silly slow-motion shots. There are far too many close-ups of Milla Jovovich's consistently blank expression in lieu of actual dramatic tension, too. All of this is reflected in the soundscape, as well, which is a shambles of bombastic score and clanging metal.The choppy editing is all the more conspicuous because the blueprint of the ""Hive"" occupies a significant space in a scene early on, only for the picture to loose all direction once inside the architecture. One moment, Alice is listening to exposition from some guy whose sister she just re-killed, and the next she's back with the group locked in a room surrounded by zombies. Another moment, Michelle Rodriguez's tough chick (yeah, I know, what a stretch for her, right) is diving for a gun underneath another horde of the walking dead; then, cut, and all of a sudden she's escaped with the rest of the remaining gang from the bitters below. Even some of the CGI is overly choppy, especially when we first see the monster recycled from the ""Alien"" series. As with the stunt work, quick cuts are also meant to conceal deficiencies in the visual effects. Play the score and sound effects loud enough and have Jovovich pose in various states of undress often enough, however, and, perhaps, nobody will notice or care, seems to be the logic here. Yet, worst of all are the movie's equivalent of video-game cut-scenes. With two of the main characters experiencing amnesia, the plot takes several breaks from the action to catch up on the backstory--the sort of poorly-directed bits of dullness that a gamer would likely press a button to skip in a video game so as to get back to killing zombies.I knew there was a reason I had avoided this movie for nearly two decades now. I only came to it now for the references to Carroll's Alice books. Unfortunately, like everything else here, these are trite. Besides a protagonist named ""Alice,"" who awakens from a state of unconsciousness, there's the AI's little girl avatar, and the AI itself is called the ""Red Queen,"" although it really should've been named ""HAL 9000,"" for how much it rips off yet another far better film, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968).

I loved this John Carpenter inspired survival Horror, infact if John Carpenter made a zombie film this would be it & that's a huge compliment.I saw this at the cinema & it was a fun time watching this survival Horror film & probably the most fun I've had watching a film at the cinema!!!It felt like this movie was made for me as at the time i was obsessed with Zombie films & i couldn't wait to see this & it didn't disappoint at all, infact it was even more enjoyable & entertaining & exciting that i could've imagined!!!Every time i revisit this film I'm reminded just how damn good it REALLY is & if I'm the only one who likes it this much i don't care as it's definitely a personal favourite of mine & one of my all time favourite films.I have big love & big Nostalgia for this Action zombie film as it was the first ever ""Zombie"" film i saw at the cinema & that's a big deal to me as i grew up obsessed with Zombie films such as George Romero's Dead Trilogy & the Evil Dead Trilogy, i honestly loved ""Resident Evil"" it's a nice budget take on those old school zombie films with a nice dose of ""John Carpenter"" mixed in so how could i not love this?The production design is excellent within the Hive & the first zombie encounter is done so well with suspense,Horror & action as we have our mixed group of Commandos & survivors having to work together to get out alive, i love that ensemble lgroup dynamic of different characters teamed up, great fun.A couple of good standout characters other than the main stars, were British actor Colin Salmon who plays the leader of the group of Commandos & his big tall frame & deep commanding voice adds alot to the very creepy beginning scenes, his character is not around long but he makes such an intense presence on screen that i would've loved him to have been a main lead!!! Also the computer expert/soldier ""Kaplan"" is good played by another British actor Martin Crewes, a good solid cast with everyone involved actually.Some of the imagery is the best I've ever seen in a zombie film & the design & look is incredible like the underground Access tunnels scene with the dripping water & grimy walls & old pipes that are heroes have to crawl accross that's an incredibly exciting & intense sequence as is the iconic laser hallway scene & the test subjects tanks scene when we first meet a zombie & the atmosphere is so raw & full of dread with it's dark smoky look & then hearing a metal being dragged accross the floor noise it's a zombie dragging an axe, just some of the greatest suspenseful moments in a zombie film I've ever seen, this movie doesn't get the recognition it so deserves & yes the other films in the franchise are not very good & don't come no where near the level of brilliance & quality here so this one 2002 movie that started it all should be considered a ""Cult Classic"" & it's definitely the best movie made by Paul Anderson.""RESIDENT EVIL"" is ridiculously underrated & yet it's more exciting than most huge budget films at the cinema now!!! To me it's a zombie masterpiece that could easily fit into the universe of the legendary ""John Carpenter"" it's got a primal raw survival tone & cold high-tech & artificial intelligence feel to it when our team enter the scary ""Hive"" underground lab base, i feel that contract of old & new here like i did with ""Escape from New York"" & the violent bloody rawness of old school zombie flicks like ""Dawn of the Dead"" for example, there's alot of quality in this film to ignore & i love it.The music score at the beginning sets the tone, it's a creepy digital score that sounds like a ""Carpenter"" inspired 80s synth score, it's really well done & one of my favourite music scores ever as it's so creepy.The cast was great especially Milla Jovovich & Michelle Rodriquez both are great actors & are both fantastic tough ladies of Action in this film, obviously ""Alice"" (Jovovich) is the heart of the movie & is on a mission to uncover the truth about herself & what's happening & ""Rain"" (Rodriguez) is a no nonsense tough as hell soldier & she will stop at nothing to get her job done. Great performances.The rest of the team are all good in their roles basically Marine types & the zombies look great with excellent FX especially the big Licker monster!!!The underground lab where the zombie outbreak starts is a really creepy setting for a zombie movie & the whole idea of a group of marines having to sneak in & shut it down is very exciting with a great sense of dread atmosphere, one of the best scenes in the movie is the terrifying laser corridor sequence, it's a scary scene & we lose most of the soldiers in that Corridor before we even get to the zombies!!!Resident Evil is definitely one of my personal favourite Zombie films of all time, i put this in my top 5 along with ""Dawn of the Dead 1978"" ""Day of the Dead 1985"" ""28 Days Later"" & ""Night of the Living Dead 1990"" all Excellent Zombie films!!!There's a great mix of cold Technical cybernetic futuristic surroundings, with the underground Hive base, & old fashioned bloody flesh-Eating zombie carnage, it's this mix of Sci-fi & Horror that makes Resident Evil very exciting,edgy & Awesome.There's an icey-cold scary atmosphere within ""The Hive"" as the corridors are empty & silent & at any moment our survivors could turn a corner into wondering zombies, it's enclosed & claustrophobic trapped setting reminded me definitely of the legendary ""Carpenter"" in it's look,mood & style.I love this movie & it's mix of exciting action scenes & moody creepy Horror & dark futuristic sci-fi setting, a stunning mix done perfectly.A BRILLIANT & scary ending.A great sci-fi action Horror Thriller & EASILY the best of the whole franchise & really the only great movie of the LOT!!!Yeah good suspense & very exciting Action make RESIDENT EVIL a great film & one of the best Zombie flicks out there!!! Definitely an underrated CLASSIC in my opinion & one hell of a fun ride & a great popcorn flick too!!!The most fun zombie flick ever.Apocalypse is a fun sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The original - and only good entry - in an increasingly lousy series.,"Resident Evil was Milla's first ""I can do it all by myself role, and the double edged sword of being in a pretty good and more-successful-than-they-thought film is that so far she has had to star in three sh*tty sequels.Resident Evil was alright though, and for a while it was a minor highlight in the awful game or comic book to film group.Resident Evil takes place in an underground facility run by the Umbrella Corp, located beneath Raccoon City, both names classic examples of why foreign game developers should consult with native English speakers if they plan to prepare a game for that market.Have you ever heard of a city as stupidly named as Raccoon City? Would you choose to live there? Wouldn't you fully pull the p*ss out of anyone that you knew that did live there? I mean seriously... And if they worked for Umbrella Corp wouldn't that only sweeten the deal? I mean Umbrella Corp?!? In essence the big-nawty Umbrella Corp (tee-hee) has made some whiz bang virus that has apparently been unleashed in the massive underground research facility, and the thousands of staff working there have been locked in to prevent the virus from escaping.The full implications of the virus are unknown, and the impact of the virus on the trapped staff is not shown in the early goings on, we do see in some initial moments that it isn't all sunshine and rainbows for everyone though.Cut! And Scene! Milla J wakes up nekkid on the floor of a running shower, how long the shower was running wasn't calculatable but her pale white skin showed no signs of ""pruning"", I looked... for a long time... in freeze frame.Milla looks around to find herself in a large mansion-y building, with evidence that she lives there, and clothes carefully laid out for her. Now dressed in a strange fanboy-fantasy outfit of a red dress over combat boots (which she later adds a black leather jacket to. Huh?), Milla has no memory, no weapons, or no understanding of why she is there. At this stage I'm not sure if she even knew she was supposed to be acting, all she did was look around with wide eyes and her lower lip perpetually dropped for her early scenes.A strike team shows up with a squad leader who looks very much like a robot (mouth closed though), it appears that Milla has something to do with things, how or what we don't know yet. At least she now has friends.And a name, Alice.The team announce their intentions to move into the underground facility, now dubbed the Hive, to see exactly what is going on. They enter through a sneaky door in the Milla-Mansion.After a short zip down into the Earth on a subway style train system the crew end up at the gates of the underground Hive, from here on in numerous variations of ""JUMP"" scares are the order of the day, each with an accompanying ""BOO"" noise.Their mission takes them to where the AI system that runs security for the facility, called Japanese-game-developerly the Red Queen, ""she"" is personified by a hologramatic young girl with a British accent, who thankfully seems also programmed to spout menacing dialogue when it is deemed to be most unsettling.Like a rapping granny, a ""black-acting"" old white guy or a talking animal in an ad or kid's film (non-animated, cartoons are supposed to talk), it just gave me the sh*ts.There is a cool visual, but logically stupid scene in a security hallway, where a series of laser patterns sweep the hall, starting with a straight laser that they can step over, and progressing to more complicated patterns that begin wiping off various digits and limbs, before expanding into a Julianne style dicing pattern that shreds all inside.Why have the first three or four patterns before bringing out the sure fire crowd pleaser?Anyone who has played the game knows that it is about fighting Zombies, and as 99.3% of viruses nowadays in films create nothing but Zombies it seems why don't we just acknowledge that they are already here?Once the Zombies arrive it seems clear that the crack squad aren't really that well-trained, many of them simultaneously lose the plot and they seem to scatter in all directions, there is also much infighting and bickering, and it takes them forever to realise that a headshot drops their assailants.Alice rapidly comes to realise that whoever she is and however stupidly she is dressed that she has skillz, and that these skillz are effective VS zombies and zombie-dogs alike. (Although if you watch the couple scenes where she fires a gun pay attention to her eyes, she blinks hard with EVERY shot fired. I guess some models turned actresses just aren't cut out to be cold calculated cinematic assassins.) After escaping the initial onslaught the survivors discover they have only a limited time to escape before they are forever shut in (and therefore dead), which you would have thought relevant information to know prior to heading in! There are various sub-plots that mean little and add nothing to the film from this point. The zombies seem to inexplicably vanish from the film for very long stretches after the first headlong rush and a new CGI-assisted menace is introduced, I guess sort of like a level-boss in the game really.Final Rating - 6.5 / 10. Despite all the sarcasm and crap written above this is actually an effective little movie, it can't help it that it was followed by three sub-terrible sequels... so far.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I have seen the best.,"After seeing the film ""Resident Evil"" I was very pleased. Writer and director Paul Anderson, who also made the ""Mortal Kombat"" movie has successfully made another game to movie port. The movie makes many references to the video games, such as the 'Nemesis' and Leon Scott Kennedy characters.... although you have to listen closely.If your wondering why you should bother with this one after losing faith with video game to movies with that horrible offering ""Tomb Raider"" you will very much like this movie. The action is steady at times but picks up after a while, it really does well in it's performance. I myself thought that this movie would be horrible, but to my surprize, I was dead wrong (yes that was a cheap pun, I know).The plot is very thick and supported by a great cast. It doesn't quite follow the games but is similar in it's own unique way.During the movie even the most die-hard horror movie fan will have jump during some sequences. Thought there are many gaps in the scenes (due to major editing as not to earn an NC-17 rating) the gaps in scenes do not show very well, I wasn't aware of this until I read an interesting review made by GameShark.com.The bottom line is simple, even if you have not played the video games, you will still understand this movie and really enjoy it. I had a really fun time watching this movie, and so will you.If I had to rate this movie I think I would have to give it a 8 out of ten. In addition to its greatness it leaves room for a sequel, and trust me, there's gonna be a sequel.",,Anonymous,Horror
"With terrible make up, CGI and score, Paul Anderson appeals to resources that are already overloaded, such as the use of loud sounds that ""come out of nowhere""","After the success of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, which cost $80 million and earned $131 million at the box office in the United States alone, it's only logical that another adaptation of a successful game won the big screen. Resident Evil at least manages to be more faithful to the spirit of the franchise than was the curvaceous heroine of Eidos. Arguably acclaimed, ""Resident Evil"" is directly responsible for the spread of survival horror in the gaming universe. Before him, ""Alone in The Dark"" had launched the genre, but it was ""Resident"" that really made it popular. According to some sources, the game is based on the Japanese game ""Sweet Home"", from 1989, in turn based on the movie ""Suiito Houmu"".The plot of the first film, revolves around the events in the basement of the Spencer Mansion. According to what the film explains, underneath the mansion is where the Beehive, a research center of the Umbrella Corporation, would be. Some things got out of control in this mega-hidden laboratory and all the employees were trapped inside, even with the release of a dangerous one, and still in tests, viruses, called in games and later in the movies, T-Virus.The T-Virus is the result of a genetically modified virus created by Umbrella and responsible for making humans look like zombies. Not getting much into the research merits, but there is an explanation for this to happen. Scientists employed by Umbrella for this research were trying to find a way to delay aging, but found that the virus is, in some ways, deadly. The point is that it killed the infected being, but later revived it with only a few active organs. Therefore, this being, now zombie, was driven by the desire to satiate hunger, providing cases of cannibalism. Anyone being bitten by a zombie would have already been infected and, in a matter of hours, would have the virus active in their body.Despite having an excellent plot to be adapted for the big screen, the director and screenwriter Paul W. S. Anderson was bringing in various elements from games without necessarily using the same characters and plot itself and that was a mistake. Evidently if these main elements were used, the film would be much more interesting, because there we would have extraordinary elements for a horror film. It could have included the Alpha rescue team, protagonists Wesker, Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine and Barry, and even the story of Albert Wesker who was an Umbrella agent with a mission to use the STARS teams as guinea pigs, in addition to the Tyrant among others stuff. These elements would bring the real characters of the game, with a lot of mystery and many horror scenes characteristic of the game and, above all, would please the fans of Capcom games. Justifying these absences, director Paul W. S. Anderson said that the film he made is a prequel (events prior to the story of the game).Analyzing all these events, you can see that Resident Evil: The Damned Guest (2002) is a film made by lovers of that universe. But was all that enough for the movie to work? The answer is no. The idea of Paul W. S. Anderson to create a completely new story, but that delivers several fan services until it works, but the way it was executed is completely disastrous. The film really posed itself as an adaptation of the game and not simply a story with bases. We see elements like the Spencer Mansion (target of the first game), the Umbrella megacorporation, the T-Virus, etc. However, the chaos of the first feature film is just throwing these elements in a blender and adding them to a new approach to the story, including a new protagonist; the character Alice (Milla Jovovich, from ""The Fifth Element""), thus distancing the renowned characters of the game, such as Jill Valentine, Leon Kennedy, Carlos Olivera, Chris Redfield and his sister, etc.The characters are poorly constructed and do not gain the public's empathy, because they are careless and do not do the least bit of surveillance. In one of the scenes, Alice goes alone and unarmed in a deserted wing, slaughtering bloodied Dobermans in the greatest ""tomato extract"" style, distributing flyers and killing mercilessly. Milla Jovovich at least has a convincing look and intonation and still manages to be the best thing about the movie. In addition to her extraordinary beauty, the actress provides a strong, fearless and convincing interpretation of Alice to the public, a character who throughout the films has been the bridge with the other protagonists of the series in the games. The character, who could only have been prepared for war, would be the greatest potential to be explored in the film, but her moral redemption and her change of ethos, justified by a surprising amnesia, transforms the situation into something stupid and puerile, underestimating intelligence of the viewer. We also have the villain, totally questionable, the Queen of the Hive is a machine that has bouts of pity, which only serve to explore choices between life and death for some infected. Characters who are presumed dead return, only to die seconds later, in a sequence of disjointed scenes that takes the patience of even the most casual viewer.Anyone, even if they haven't played anything in the Resident Evil franchise in their life, read between the lines, will see that the story Anderson told there was a kind of remake of ""Alice in Wonderland"" in the universe of the famous Capcom franchise. If you look closely, the main character is called Alice. Who she fights in the film is an artificial intelligence known as The Red Queen. The elevator the characters use to enter the Hive is all mirrored, referencing the book Alice Through the Mirror. When Alice enters the Hive and has a flashback of her lost memory about Umbrella's lab, she sees scientists operating a white rabbit. When a certain character is infected by the T-Virus, the Red Queen orders Alice to cut off her head. Anyway, there are many similarities between the film and the works of Lewis Carroll.Paul W. S. Anderson, who has already proved that video games and horror are his thing (he directed Mortal Kombat - 1995 - and Enigma do Horizonte - 1997), but the director, in this work, seems to forget that this is an action film adapting a franchise from horror of video games. Without the slightest originality, he appeals to resources that are already overloaded, such as the use of loud sounds that come ""out of nowhere"" to try to scare the audience. There are even some scares during the film, but the frantic and chopped action disturbs the plot's rhythm too much, getting cloying at times. The film is noisy, the electronic soundtrack by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson along with the shooting make the feature extremely tiring. Even in relation to the claustrophobic environment of games, the director manages to emulate that very well, even appealing to angles that refer to games. But the characters don't have charisma, the acting is very weak, and at times it even sounds a little playful, and look that this is a film that takes itself too seriously.Resident Evil monsters don't convince viewers, zombies are light and don't tear anyone apart, they just scratch and bite. The members of the elite squad casually enter the alleys, to the point of letting their tactical leader pass through a corridor full of traps in a scene with numerous continuity errors, such as the disappearance of corpses. The sets, which looked very elaborate at the beginning of the film, take on a very tasteless style and seem to be built with cardboard and cardboard. The makeup is so horrendous and the CG effects are so poor, aging terribly badly over the years. What about the monster created by live tests by the Umbrella Corporation that appears only to cause some tension in the final minutes of the film? The CGI is so precarious that the direction tried to avoid close-ups on the monster, but still couldn't avoid the fake movement and the unthreatening look.Luckily, ""Resident Evil"" isn't a complete waste: as pure and simple entertainment, it's a reasonable movie, which has fun with its dark look, as well as being the return of zombie movies (which doesn't mean much either). Even with shabby and paltry interpretations, the character's ooze sensuality (which, on the other hand, is not consistent with the situations they go through during the film). The outcome leaves some questions open, but at no time does this overcome the weaknesses of the plot, making doubt become banal. In the end, ""Resident Evil"" hardly works as a film and even less as an adaptation. If it weren't for the ending faithfully portraying the mood of the beginning of the second game, when Alice takes a shotgun from the police car and we see Raccoon City completely in chaos, fans' hopes might have died for this movie anyway. However, they cleverly managed to arrest them for a sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This Film is like ""Night of the Living Dead"" !","The title of the film sounded very interesting and then I got rather tired of seeing a gal running around in a red slip and boots. The girl in the red slip finally was given a man's coat to cover herself up and still she continued to wear this outfit which started to get torn and in threads. Out of the blue, all these so called human beings appear like in the ""Night of the Living Dead"", eating everyone in sight and leaving nothing on the bone.

A spectacular masterpiece by Paul W.S.

It's a somewhat unique movie in that it's something different and reminiscent of a typical B-movie. It's hard to explain, but I have no reason to consider this movie bad. The special effects, the makeup, the soundtrack by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson and even Milla Jovovich are sensational.

The Anderson curse begins,"love the resident evil games and I love the zombie films of Romero. I was really looking forward to a Resident Evil movie rumours had circulated for years about Romero directing and people like Robert Partric playing the key characters. Clearly Andersion wasn't interested in great things like that instead he thought he'd throw ""Aliens"",""2001"",""George A. Romero's Trilogy"" and a bit of ""The Matrix"" in a blender and see what comes out. I can't believe how bad this movie is first their is not one character from the original game in it instead a group of commandos with ridiculous names like One and Rain. 2nd the monsters, where are they? all their is are zombies(Key to the game of coarse) and a licker(Not even from Resident Evil it's from Resident Evil 2!). No sign of the hunters or the tyrant the two famous creatures from the first game. The platoon of commandos is such a rip off of the Marine corps from ""aliens"" right down to the tough soldier girl who doesn't take any crap (Played very annoyingly by Michele Rodreguize who also played the exact same character in the ""fast and the furious"" and ""Swat""). There are very few scenes that don't rip-off another film ""the Matrix"" rip-offs are probably the worst, watching ""Alice"" jump 6 feet in the air and karate kick a zombie dog in slow motion is absolutely ridiculous. What really rubs salt in the wounds is that George A. Romero(Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead) wrote a script for this and was going to direct. I've read his script it's so much better than this trash.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody Brilliant!,"Resident Evil is a great horror movie. It was amazing! The zombies freaked me out, the dogs were very scary, and the other thing was scary. Michelle Rodriguez did a great job as Rain. I liked her tough attitude. Milla Jovovich was great as Alice. Rain was always tough and never scared but it would have helped if we knew more about her. Alice was always trying to help out and beat zombies. The movie takes you through a chilling look at ""The Hive"" after the deadly T-virius infects everybody down there. The comando team has three hours to stop the virius from infecting the whole world. They also come upon some incredible things.

good back then but nowadays outdated CGI,"Based on a game Resident Evil was meant to be the next big thing. Seen it back in 2002 it was indeed something special but no out on Blu Ray I saw it again and it was a bit passé.Why, because the digital effects used are a bit out of time. It's strange to see it nowadays with the effects from back then, but wait, the faces doesn't always look believable when the dead are walking. But the dogs really looked stunning. The big monster on the other hand was clearly to see that it all was CGI. But not only that, even for a monster flick it is low on gore and even red stuff. Most of the slaughtering is done off-screen.But it is really the story that makes it watchable after all. A virus is let free in The Hive, an underground laboratory. The computer shut down all entrances to avoid infection. An elite military corpse has to investigate what went wrong and by entering The Hive they come across Alice (Milla Jovovich). She has amnesia and slowly her mind tells her what happened to her and what is happening inside The Hive.Being low on gore and red stuff Ithought it was meant to be PG-13 but knowing Milla we all know she isn't afraid to show her body and that's what she exactly does in Resident Evil. She even goes fully naked and shows it all if you watch closely.It was a nice entry in the genre with the walking dead and the monster but for me nowadays it doesn't really stand up towards the technology. That's weird because older flicks do stand their time. Still, worth watching.Gore 1/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing special,"Having never played the Resident Evil' video games this was all new to me. Many of my friends have berated this movie for ignoring the storyline of the games, but having never experienced them myself, this was a totally new experience to me.The plot for this movie centres around the headquarters of one of the world's largest companies. After a chemical container is broken and the contents released, the super-computer in charge of the place immediately takes over the facility and locks everybody in. A few hours later a small military force is sent in to try and regain control but unfortunately for them, the computer is not their only concern.In my opinion, Resident Evil' is an average zombie/action movie with a few interesting and exciting moments, but equally as many downfalls. There is an over-abundance of poor and unrealistic CGI throughout the movie which really harms the atmosphere that is trying to be created by director Paul W.S. Anderson. Combining some interesting camera work with some chilling visuals Anderson is able to bring the viewer into the movie; however the viewer is quickly snapped back to reality once one of the unrealistic CGI effects makes an appearance. This is a major floor, for the same price as the CGI the makers could have just as easily bought the materials to make great artificial effects such as those from The Thing' (1984) or Hellraiser' (1987) but alas, in these days of Hollywood big-budget horror, the brilliant effects of yesteryear are being replaced with mediocre CGI effects which can seriously damage a movie.The use of flashback images was also utilised in the movie, and while I feel that some were used to good effect and added some much-needed history to Resident Evil', I have to think that many of the flashbacks were filler used to generate a quick scare, as they were generally accompanied with loud music (as per all Hollywood horror movies).The screenplay also has some major flaws too in my eyes. Milla Jovovich was fairly good (though far from perfect) as Alice in the movie, but her part seemed to be written so ineptly. Considering what events are portrayed that revolve around her in the movie the script doesn't seem to fit the events. I found it hard to believe that she would not be more on edge and questionable, instead she seemed to just take a c'est la vie approach and accept what was going on too easily. I think there was a lot missing from the script that should have been included; a little more character interaction, for instance, would have aided this production in my opinion.The rest of the cast were average at best. I never have been a fan of Michelle Rodriguez's acting abilities. Once again she plays the typical `tough chick' roll that has so far been so predominant in her career, yet she continues to irritate me in this role as she also did in The Fast and the Furious' (2001). I'm not really much for her at all and can see her career fading out pretty fast unless she can break out of the roll she has now been typecast in. Martin Crewes, who I remember from the Sky One UK TV series Dream Team', played the part of Chad Kaplan very well in my opinion. I wasn't previously a fan of him as an actor but out of the actors in Resident Evil' I found his to be the best performance in the movie as he did manage to attract some sympathy for his character and, in my opinion, managed to hold the production together.There were some good and entertaining action scenes in the movie. One scene in the Red Queen's Chamber was particularly exciting and even slightly intense, but these moments of 'Resident Evil' were few and far between which was a shame. Unfortunately the makers seemed to try and highlight the subtexts of the movie rather than the plot in hand which led to a rather poor lack of action and excitement.This film was a little of a let down and is definitely not anything new in the horror genre as it recycles some of the successful elements of Romero's Dead' trilogy and adds a 21st Century perspective. Resident Evil' is somewhat unimaginative and I do believe that more could have been done with the film. Little tension or suspense is eventually built despite the attempts by Anderson to create an atmosphere; in the end the usual loud noise scare tactics of all modern-mainstream horror productions were resorted to and unfortunately damaged what could have been a great movie. It's worth checking out once, though I'm not sure if I will ever personally come back to this movie. My rating for Resident Evil'  6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A cheesy, juvenile action blockbuster, but at least there's lots of adrenaline","This movie is another cheesy video game adaptation, and is based on a game series which I'm not familiar with. The film was released years before it ever caught my attention and it obviously wasn't any of the ""Resident Evil"" games that lead me to watch it, since I've never played any of them. I first found out about this Paul W.S. Anderson movie when I learned that Milla Jovovich was in it. Before I rented it the other day, I knew it was one of the polarizing modern action blockbusters, but fortunately not one of the universally panned ones. Due to all the criticism, I wasn't expecting a great film, but thought it could be pretty good at best. I can now understand the widespread criticism, but despite the severe flaws, I found some redeeming qualities.Below Raccoon City, there is a top secret underground genetic research facility called the Hive, owned by the extremely powerful Umbrella Corporation. After a vial is broken, releasing a virus, the lab's supercomputer known as the Red Queen locks the Hive to prevent the virus from escaping, trapping and killing all the employees inside! A military unit then takes Alice and Spence, two people suffering from amnesia, and goes to the Hive to investigate what has happened. The head of the commandos, known as the ""One"", explains why they are all here, and several members of the team attempt to disable the Red Queen, but are cut up by a laser! This leaves Alice, Spence, Rain Ocampo, Matt Addison, and Chad Kaplan to continue the mission. They discover that the supercomputer is not the only problem, as the employees who were killed have mutated into flesh-eating zombies, and can now be found all over the facility!From the beginning, I could tell the film wasn't that great, but when the emergency in the ""Hive"" begins, so does the suspense! After that sequence, Milla Jovovich, who plays Alice, makes her first appearance in the film naked, waking up in the mansion shower, and this scene could easily be cited as a highlight for straight male viewers like me. The suspense continues as Alice looks around in the mansion, but unfortunately, it doesn't stay consistent. The sci-fi action horror film can be a little hard to follow at times, the music is sometimes really cheesy, and there are some extremely juvenile lines. In addition to that, the characters are underdeveloped, and at least some of them seem like naive high school students who shouldn't be on a mission like this. The acting is nothing special, and Michelle Rodriguez' performance as Rain Ocampo is particularly poor. However, while the walk through the Hive before the mutants are found is pretty dull, there's a lot more adrenaline as the film goes along and the group faces the dangers of this underground facility. Jovovich and her fighting moves were another highlight for me. Also, as usual for these modern action sci-fi blockbusters, there are great sets and special effects in this film.I'm not sure if this video game adaptation deserves the 7/10 rating I'm giving it. Overall, it is cheesy and juvenile, and probably mainly appeals to young male viewers (younger than me). I realize Paul W.S. Anderson was also the one who directed 1995's ""Mortal Kombat"" (another movie based on a video game), and I didn't like that film at all, but for some reason, that wasn't quite the case with this 2002 blockbuster. I'm not sure what I would think of it with a second viewing, but it wasn't bad for one viewing, as much as I think some of the haters have made some good points! If you hate mindless action, you will hate this movie, so don't watch it, and if you like that sort of thing, well, you MIGHT like this first ""Resident Evil"" movie, but there's no guarantee. The flaws could still be too much for you to take, and you could end up wondering how anyone could possibly like the movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
As soulless as they come.,"It's hard to know where to start.  Perhaps the writer/director, Paul W.S. Anderson, intends some sort of irony, when he serves up this mindless, soulless corpse of a film.  But really, I don't think he's that complex. Drivel of this kind puts even bombs such as 'Tomb Raider' in a good light.The premise involves something along the lines of: ""corporation happily conducting research into viruses, when it all goes terribly wrong, and there's some zombies and some screaming and .. er, some zombies."" The plot then takes this premise and promptly sits down. I mean it.  It goes absolutely nowhere.  It's as if the director just wants to string together meaningless, unrelated scenarios from generic computer games.  Characters are suddenly alone, without explanation.  Between scenes, the lead alternates from scared bystander to superhuman commando.  If by this point, you're thinking ""The only thing that kept this reviewer watching this film to the end was so that he can moan about it afterwards"", you'd be utterly correct.Milla Jovovich provides the gratuitous nudity that the director obviously feels belongs in a film like this.  He gets it out of the way at the start of the film, almost as if he's catering for all the viewers who will walk out during the film.  It may seem unfair to dismiss Jovovich like this, but it isn't as if she does any acting in this film.  To be fair, she has absolutely no material to work with, and the director's idea of character development seems to be the progression from ""wearing a jacket"" to ""not wearing a jacket"".Michelle Rodriguez garnered critical acclaim for her work in 'Girlfight', but sleepwalks through her role here.  The forgettable male cast repeat tired lines like clockwork; including the immortal ""We're not getting out of here. We're all going to die."" The great Hollywood idea behind making movies based on computer games seems to be 'Neither acting nor development is important, just do some action scenes, and the unwashed masses will be happy.'  Here, even the action scenes disappoint.  Kicks and punches are unconvincing, the gunfights mind-numbingly boring.The tension and gore that are supposed to sell a film in this genre are at least attempted.  The basic problem with tension is that we feel no empathy for the characters, and don't particularly care if they live or die.  The problem with the gore is, like everything else in the film, it is presented in an entirely meaningless way.  The film doesn't even set up the basic threat properly; if the zombies are so hungry, why don't they feed on each other? That is the only plothole that I will mention, because if you are ever unfortunate enough to be made to watch this film, perhaps playing 'spot-the-plotholes' might provide you with your entertainment for the evening.Oh, and at the climax, the director unleashes some of the worst 'special' effects I have ever seen in my life.  I nearly cried out in horror at how poorly done it was.  Oh, perhaps the director is employing his special 'irony' again. Silly me.2.0 / 10",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly good,"It's a zombie flick loosely based on a video game. I had no other expectations other than to be entertained for an hour-and a-half. But the movie went far above my expectations. Yeah, there are similarities to ""Aliens"" and every other George Romero Dead flick, but it didn't detract from my basic enjoyment of the film. With the exception of one or two exposition scenes in the middle, the movie was non-stop. Milla and Michelle were great. And the Red Queen was a nice touch.I can't believe how many people are nitpicking over the inconsistancies between the game and the movie. See it again and suspend your disbelief. I did and enjoyed it. And I own the first 2 games myself.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good Movie,"There are movies that win acadamy awards, then there are movies that entertain you for two hours non stop.  This is one of those movies.  I see one new release every week and this is the best movie in a long time.  I took it for what it was.  Im not video game geek who is going to point out every little flaw but I am a fan of the game.  I spent the first 2 and a half minutes wondering if Mila would get naked, score.  The second half trying not to jump out of my seat even when I knew it was coming. and the third half hoping Michele Rodriquez would be a part of the sequal.

I'm Torn...,"My opinion on this film is very split, because on one hand certain scenes are very subtle and subvert expectations. But, on the other hand the effects used in this movie, especially the laser scene are so badly cg. It makes my brain cringe when i have to see enemies from some of my favorite games butchered like this, the licker especially actually looks worse than the games at the time. A large portion of what makes this film so bad at times is that the narrative is ripped from a different form of story telling. you get about the same experience from watchiing a compilation of game cutscenes. However there are some good things about this film. as previously mentioned it subverts expectations and has good reason for you to be filled in on the story without it feeling forced. The story isn't masterfull or anything but it has its moments and some of the later characters you get attached to. so i guess if you don't mind phantom menace level bad effects you can get some very decent entertainment from it. In conclusion, should you watch this movie? my answer is if you're a fan of the cult genre or a die-hard fan of the games. go in with low expectations and it could be fairly decent.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Now, I can see through its shortcomings, particularly the nasty editing and inferior visual effects.

Nothing intellectual,This is a good and gory zombie action film. It is not full of horror and suspense but it makes you jump and some of the gore kicks you back a little.

Evil to the core.,"This is a good mixture of formula movies. It has elements of a game with the same name but does not compromise the fun by trying to stay inbounds with the game. It mostly reminds me ofThe Andromeda Strain (1971)with a dash ofThe Omega Man (1971)tossed in.The movie starts out with Alice played by Milla Jovovich displaying her birthday suit. Then after the initial shock, we settle down to the story of what looks like a weird group of special forces especially forcing her into a strange world full of scary things.There is plenty of action and as Alice regains her memory we find out if she is a goody or baddie. In the mean time that is plenty of evil present. We get a lot of biting humor and plenty of action.The only distraction is the background music but you can turn off the sound and read the subtitles.This may be worth a second watch to find clues that you did not notice the first time around.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Horror fans, wait no more.","From the opening title sequence to the apocalyptic ending, this film tears you away from your chair and pushes you headfirst deep into its murky depths. Being a film based on a video game, you'd expect a film with non-stop action and visual effects, but without in-depth characters or good writing. `Resident Evil' keeps its characters fresh and interesting, enough so you at least care what happens to them, and has more than enough original plot gimmicks to break out of the sci-fi/ horror genre, but still manages to deliver the action, special effects, and zombie gore that the fans of the game love.I never played the games too much, but I know enough about them to know that this film takes its share of liberties. The characters are not the same ones out of the games, and those who want to get picky will notice that some of the notable creatures out of the games have been altered a little to drive the plot along. But the changes are so small in relation to the overall storyline, which is right on with the game.The thing that saved the film, though, is the direction. Director Paul Anderson's mix of action and horror was perfect for `Resident Evil.' (His first big hit was 1995's `Mortal Kombat,' the first of the successful video game movies, and what I believe started the whole video game adaptation craze in the first place).  He brings `Night of the Living Dead' to `The X-Files' and actually creates some genuine scares. The score by Marilyn Manson helps, along with the grinding heavy metal soundtrack, to create a feel that is dark and creepy one minute, pulse pounding and exciting the next. The sets are another thing that play a key role in this film. Just like any of the countless haunted house films out there, the environment is as much a character as the actors, and this film pulls it off nicely. It explains everything thoroughly, without over-explanations of every single thing that happens. This film won't puzzle you, but it doesn't insult your intelligence, either.Overall, the film is excellent, especially considering the horror films from the past few years. It doesn't attempt to be more than it is, but what it is is quite enough. No over the top horror acting, no over-the-top horror violence, but just enough to please.I recommend this film to fans of the game and to those who didn't know there was a game.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A slightly above average horror action thriller based on a video game,"Video game movies have been around since the video game industry boomed after its initial crash. Considered to be a guilty pleasure and one of the more accurate adaptations was the original Mortal Kombat (1995). Yes, it was cheesy and it didn't gain high reviews, but people still enjoy it today. Since then video game movie adaptations have been a thing for the last couple decades and probably will continue onward. The level of interest movie studios has had though seemed to have gone in waves. By the end of the 1990s it wasn't as profitable until this movie came out. The weird thing is how it started. Reason for this is that this movie was directed by Paul W. S. Anderson...the same director of Mortal Kombat (1995). What are the odds he reinvigorates a genre once every decade or so?The plot of the film is that sometime in the future, a national conglomerate company called The Umbrella Corporation is the sole provider for all consumers of basic needs. However, behind the scenes they also produce high weapons grade items and bio-hazards. When a deadly mutagen is released inside the company's facility and goes into lockdown, a taskforce is sent in to fix the issue. Tagging along with them are what seem to be three ordinary civilians. Two of which, Spence (James Purefoy) and Alice (Milla Jovovich) have a case of memory loss and don't recall how they were involved to begin with. The premise is the most intriguing part of the movie, story wise. As for the rest, there's not a whole lot to get behind.There are plot holes that turn up later on that don't make sense when looking at the full story. Employees of the umbrella corporation work in a facility underground and are not allowed to be above ground. Yet, the initiation of this whole plot happens above ground involving employees of said company. That's not to say Paul W. S. Anderson did not do his research on the brand though. To be able to write and direct this feature, he made sure to dive deep into the games. With that said, there are several references throughout the movie to the video game itself. To that, fans of the video game series must have been marginally happy with those nods of nostalgia. Despite those clever callbacks, charming characters are hard to find among all that's on screen.Coming out on top of the cast as not only the lead actor, not only as an action star but also meeting her future husband (the director); Milla Jovovich plays the only character a viewer might root for. The other cast members like Colin Salmon, James Purefoy, Eric Mabius, Michelle Rodriguez and Martin Crewes act their way through the movie just fine, but their characters just aren't written with anything special. The same could be said for the special effects, more specifically the CGI. Being that CGI had been shown to blend fairly well with physical backgrounds by this point, it makes no sense why some of the visuals look like they were still from the era of Mortal Kombat (1995). Maybe these aspects were also homage to the original Resident Evil video game since the visuals and characters weren't Oscar material either.The gore on the other hand is pretty good looking as well as the practical effects. Credit to cinematographer David Johnson for helping with getting good looking shots. The set design also helps in the look of the film. Lastly for music, the score was composed by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson. While there has been no clear official release of the score itself, the music to the film is a mix of electronic pulses and brooding synthesizers. The idea was to have edgy music and while it feels that way in some places, other times it matches the more tactical depiction used by the military unit. It's worth a listen if possible because it is not the classic sounding orchestral score one would expect.Director Paul W. S. Anderson seems to have had a knack for jump starting video game movie trends early on in his career by doing the same thing twice. While it's not by any means high end in performances, this video game movie is fairly faithful to its source material even if the special effect qualities are subpar in certain places even for 2002. Music also provides an interesting listen.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Great movie, could've used a little more RE","Long before it came out when I first about the plot for the Resident Evil movie (Red Queen computer?) I was very disappointed.

I decided to watch RE and I was very pleasantly surprised. It's a really good movie despite some really stupid plot holes. My only little ""gripe"" with the movie was that it was action not horror unlike the games. Through the whole movie I felt kinda like ""This has so little to do with the Resident Evil games"". Then the guy says ""I want him for the Nemesis project."" and I'm thinking ""Oh please, that's just cheap.""

"""Whoa! this hall is dangerous!""",I watched this movie as a kid back in 2002 and I remember thinking it was amazing and the best thing ever but years later I watched it on DVD and then recently on Blu Ray and well it is a good zombie and action movie it isn't a good Resident Evil movie.The movie takes the core concept of Resident Evil and coupled together with the games basic lore turns a survival horror game with a unique story into a basic action movie. Resident Evil is a big name franchise and in the right hands could make for a great movie series as well sadly the movies only got worse in the sequels.The actors are well cast no complaints there but you don't see a Zombie in the movie until around the forty minute mark which is way to late for a zombie movie. The dialogue and setup for the movies storyline takes over forty minutes and is just boring and uninteresting. The movie is filled with shots of swat team members checking around every corner in every area with weapons drawn as they walk around just to pad out the movies run time.The movies make up and practical effects are great but what really spoils it is the movies bad CGI creature meant to be a creature from the game. Sadly the CGI is laughable and when watching the movie on Blu Ray looks even worse do to the better picture and brightness that you don't get with DVD or VHS which this movie was also released on.I would recommend watching Resident Evil if your looking for a fun zombie action movie to watch. If your a fan of the Resident Evil game series the movie is definitely enjoyable but the games are far superior in story and atmospheric.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The action was good from the beginning to end and the only reason I did not vote the movie a 10 on 10 (based on rating previous VG movies) was that it suffered from the stereotypically not so perfect acting. Let's face it, it usually sucks in these types of movies.I know that this review might seem empty but the truth is that there is not much to say.

It's Not Good,"Let's not beat around the bush; this movie franchise is bad and we all know it. Paul W. S. Anderson might very well be a terrible film director, but he's proven himself time and time again to be a financially successful one, so there's obviously an audience for his brand of trash. There are many that defend the likes of this and Anderson's ""Event Horizon""; many that will claim his movies are blockbuster escapism, and that might be the case, but that doesn't stop them from being bad. There is little to no respectable craft involved with the writing and direction on display here. The photography is uninteresting and 'saggily' framed for most of the duration. The cast are boring to the Nth degree and do little to hold your attention. The highlight of the movie is the 'laser corridor' sequence, which is extremely effective and comes early enough in the movie that it hints at the possibility of decent material ahead. Unfortunately that's about as good as it gets and even that sequence is plagiarised from Vincenzo Natali's infinitely superior 1997 Sci-Fi horror flick, ""Cube"". There are zombie monsters, but so what? We can see those is 1000s of other equally pitiful throwaway horror movies that are free to watch on streaming services. Do yourself...No, do all of us a favour and stop putting money in Paul W. S. Anderson's pocket and seek out a decent film for a change.

There isn't much in the way of character development either, so it's not easy to give a damn what happens to them. Also, it's not good when there are numerous plot holes in a film with little plot to begin with.There is a distinct lack of action as well. It takes close to half the film before any zombies show up, and even then it's just some erratic shooting accompanied by too fast editing and deafening rock music. There's not a lot of gore and blood either, which isn't good considering that it's a zombie film after all.It's not the worse film ever made - the premise is quite good, but wasted - but it resembles too many other films, and fails to show anything new or even remotely exciting.

"""There is no next level; All access: DENIED. Ignorance is past tense, Game Over: YOU DIED.""","I'm a fan of the videogame series Resident Evil. This franchise made me a horror fan with its embracing of B-Grade pulp horror tropes, brilliant monster design, genuinely frightening moments (The Door from the original Resident Evil 2, amirite?) and creepy atmosphere. It also has the baggage of being seemingly cursed when it comes to screen adaptations between a string of awful movies and an equally wretched (if not, WORSE) Streaming TV show that thoroughly miss the point of the series.And yet, the first Resident Evil movie is actually pretty good. Yes. Really. 2002's Resident Evil (written and directed by Event Horizon's Paul W. S. Anderson) is a genuinely fun, goofy, bleak and endearing film that IMO, does a pretty good job of translating the vibes and atmosphere of the games to the big screen. And also provides more than enough Zombie and Monster carnage to keep game fans happy (mostly).Despite none of the characters from the game being featured (long story, the script for the final film began life as a bootleg), the cast here is actually pretty enjoyable. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is a well-rounded stand-in for Jill with a compelling character arc of trying to rediscover her past in the Hive, co-lead Matt (Eric Mabius) is the sympathetic spy out to find evidence of Umbrella's wrongdoing, Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) is the lovable deadpan snarker, Spence (James Purefoy) is a fellow amnesiac who has his own hidden role and an interesting relationship with Alice, Kaplan (Martin Krewes) is the nerd, and the rest of the Sanitation team are Cannon Fodder. These characters are simple and tropey, but they're likable, fun to follow and very much in the ""B-Movie"" mould of the game's characters. Plus, the actors all do well with the material they've been given and you can tell everyone was having a blast filming this.In terms of horror, the movie is very much more an action horror film in the vein of Demon Knight and Aliens, but still features a pretty creepy atmosphere with some truly gruesome zombie makeup, an intense sequence involving Alice encountering a pack of Cerberuses, and a twist regarding the film's big main monster, the Licker (which made its debut in RE2). There are some pretty good death scenes, some intense moments and a dark industrial score by composers Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson that I think make this movie good Halloween viewing. As for the action, it's well paced and shot, with the initial reveal of the Undead being a stand out, and other sequences like the Sewer scene being gripping despite suffering from some odd hyperkinetic edits.Finally, the cinematography is pretty good, with the camera emulating the fixed camera angles from the first few games in some areas, and the industrial greys, whites, and blues creating a foreboding atmosphere.However, there are a good deal of issues here: Some of the dialogue is pretty hokey, the editing and its ""fast and loose"" style can get over bearing, there are a few goofy moments, and the lack of the game's cast will disappoint a lot of people. The biggest issue is the title, though. ""Resident Evil"". Because it has those two words in the name, and uses the mythology as a basis, Resident Evil will forever be doomed to comparison with its superior interactive brethren, and ultimately, it will live in their shadow, which sucks because the movie is pretty good despite its faults and one of the better video game movies out there.So yeah. It's a bit messy. But, if you've got time to kill and want something fun to watch in the Halloween season, you have much worse options than Resident Evil. Dust this bad boy off, and take him for a spin. He's had a rough life.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A good zombie film, but not a good film","Resident Evil isn't a bad film, just nothing exceptional. As a zombie film, it hits its marks, but doesn't do anything to distinguish itself from the pack. Day of the Dead is a much better film if you want to see the walking dead in action.As a video game adaption, it does what any good adaption does: keep only the bare bones of the material and build new flesh over them. The original story contained in the game has thrown out. Unlike some game adaptions (Double Dragon, for instance) it works in this case, but mainly because the original story was a generic zombie / mad science plot. The Resident Evil movie has just taken one version of zombies / mad science and replaced it with another. In fact, the links to the game are so tenuous (apart from the theme and some stylistic factors) you wonder if the license was bought to attract a greater audience.The big problem with the film is that the narrative gets weaker as the film progresses. Starting with the stealing of the T-virus (the zombie making agent) and the smashing of a T-virus tube in the lab (because the thief was evil, as far as I can tell), the computer security system known as the Red Queen locks down the facility and kills all the employees. It's a great start, and the use of security cameras as a view point for the audience is a great effect because you get to see the Red Queen's abilities and depersonalised status. From here on it's downhill in regards to the narrative - some flashbacks, a weak backstory surrounding attempted corporate espionage and characters making stupid / evil decisions against all common sense. You got bitten by a zombie for which there is no cure? Hey, hang around us, please! A top secret bio-warfare facility went into lockdown? First thing we should do is open it up!There are some great moments, such as the appearance of the skinless dogs. But there are so many holes in the story the movie suffers. That said, the ending does leave a huge gaping hole for a sequel, and if one is made I'll go and see and pick it apart too!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
absolute garbage - You'd expect this kind of tripe with an student film not a studio....,"I really can't find anything good about this film. 
The point of the story and chosen characters is confusing and just weak.
Michelle Rodriguez particularly is just annoying across the board with everything she says, acts and does. Though the whole cast isn't any good either including the AI computer.
The prosthetics and make up are awful and where they were actually good they utilise no animatronics making the dogs especially just look like statues being thrown at the camera, the camera work and transition shots are really jarring, uninspired and weird, the dialogue , script writing and one liners just come across stupid and make it feel like the characters don't even know what they are doing or saying.
Clearly money was put into the set production and some animation for this movie only. Whoever made some of the actual scenes and did the set design were clearly very good. Unfortunately that's all this film is; some good set design, everything else is just nothing coloured in.
The only reason the film is even rated as a 6 out of 10 is purely out of the success of the video game itself. As a stand alone film it is just terrible.

"Everything I expected from the Resident Evil movie, after playing the games.","When saw the first Resident Evil game, I thought it sucked, but that was because I only saw a few snapshots of it. I started playing the game a few weeks later, I loved everything, the story, the graphics, gameplay, environment, everything ! Most important was how the game pulled you into the Resident Evil world, creepy !... When Resident Evil II (game) came out, I played it 'till the end in one night... Same goes for the other RE games... Then, the movie, I just hoped they followed the tag lines of the games... and... They did ! Just beautiful to see the underground labs, the umbrella squad working, the zombies... and, most important, the feeling that the games gave me while playing them, just giving in to the movie and letting you think you're in Resident Evil world, just like the games did. Ofcourse you can only feel this way about the movie when you've played the games. If you haven't played the games, and you like the movie, it's a must to go and play them now ! Go deeper into the Resident Evil world :) Can't wait 'till the second movie comes out :)Peace,Marcus",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Despite being a rather cheesy and popcorn adaptation of a game, they know how to hypnotize the audience.","Yes, the CGI is awful. Yes, you can see the arrival of the plot twist from a mile away. Definitely a horror movie that lacks horror. But what can I say, the subject and concept are enjoyable, and they know well how to enchant the audience with a few clear formulas.I had never thought that the horror genre could be pornofied. Even their attempts to choose actors in the film who are as handsome or beautiful as possible seem quite innocent compared to their other actions. Millo Johovic is almost always wet in a horror movie, she wears nightgown-like clothes, she undresses completely at the beginning and end of the movie, and in the middle of all this chaos and creatures, she flies and kicks zombies, half-naked, without fear in any scene. Even though there is always a corrupt company, hidden secrets and experiments going wrong, which are intriguing plot elements, but obviously the movie was tried to be marketed from somewhere else. That's obviously Milla's face and legs.But definitely not from the boss. When the CGI of the main monster of the movie is this bad, it is very difficult to be afraid or take it seriously. So, although the zombie parts are not bad, every time the boss appears is like a joke.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Avoid this.,"Resident Evil - Ugh. When the best thing you can say about a film is it's locations, something is terribly wrong. An underground evil corporation (and that's about ALL that is realistic about RE) named The Unbrella Corporation kills all of it's employees and lets 3 survive along with a Swat team to get mauled by zombies and try and escape. The movie takes an hour (after 2 glorious minutes of actually scary elevator stuff) to do a lot of boring exposition. None of it is terribly well done or intelligently said, as none of the characters are good at acting. And then the zombies show up because of the T-virus, because turning people into mindless killing machines (except they aren't. When off-screen, they ravage an entire city. When on-screen, they can't even walk straight) is SUCH a good strategy. The zombies aren't scary, and you don't care about them, much less the cast. There's Milla Jolovich, who spends half the movie kicking the crap out of zombies, and the other half looking like a stunned cow. There's Michelle Rodriguez, whose most intelligent line is ""Blow me"" and is not only and ice queen, but also can't act to save her soul (I honestly couldn't tell the difference between her as a normie and her as a zombie). The only good part is the Licker and a laser field that dices up some people we couldn't care less about (But couldn't it have done Paul S. Anderson, the maker of this tripe instead?). So the acting sucks. The writing sucks. (The most intelligent word used is implore, and it's said by a computer voice by a British school-girl, so that doesn't count) The directing sucks. What's to like here? This is NOT the game that a generation of Playstation owners loved and cherished.D-",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finally - a decent zombie flick for the millenium!!,"Fortunate enough to be invited to an advance screening of the new ""Resident Evil"" movie, I went along with a niggling voice at the back of my mind reminding me of how cheap and nasty the ""Tomb Raider"" movie turned out to be...However, I was pleasantly suprised when my favourite game of all time made it's screen debut - it LOOKS like a George Romero movie, it SOUNDS like one, it even SMELLS like one! At last, a decent zombie flick for the millenium!!!The first 15 minutes or so chug along superbly, a pounding metal heartbeat in the background guides us through the cataclysmic events that mark the beginning of the end for the Umberella coporation (or IS it? Baaaahahaha! etc)  Without giving too much away, this movie is the splatter-gore-death-undeed-dead-corpsey-doom-fan's ultimate movie, central characters being killed off left right an centre (yaaaaaay!!! Nobody ever does that any more!), convincing zombies, and the undead dobermans.....maaaaaaaaaaaaan....as a bonus, they don't include the awful music from the first Res Evil game (remember, when the dog comes flying thru the window in the corridor? That dodgy keyboard drumbeat thing kicks in, arrrghhhh).90 minutes of pure bliss - snappy one-liners, some absurdly good acting for this kind of movie, and enough blood and sticky goosh to keep any die-hard fan happy.For Wesker's sake, ignore the critics -  GO SEE THIS FILM, we won't see one like it until...well, the sequel!Until then, I'll be the one hiding in a quivering heap under the table :)Cheers!",,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining movie based on a video-game. No more no less.,"Without the most flair or talent, they managed to create a compelling personal story for the protagonist (Mila) and explained the (very simple) context and plot efficiently.Once the action kicks in, the pace is great and the survival aspect mesh really well with the somwhat intriguing plot. The characters are thin, of course, but they work too, without annoying ""comic-relief only"" or ""the defenseless"" victim.I'm sure someone could find plot-holes and there is nothing special here on any level.

No doubt, it is one of the best zombie movies I have ever watched.The movie is exciting since it starts and it does not has a scene that is boring. The main character is in great mentality and tried her best to perform.

Should have been better...,"Somewhat loosely based on the video game of the same name, Resident Evil follows a team of special forces soldiers and security personell as they investigate a secret laboratory run by the Umbrella Corporation. The lab recently went dark and completely locked itself down for reasons unknown, so the team break in to find out why. As it turns out, a secret viral bioweapon called the ""T-Virus"" contaminated the facility, turning all the workers into the shuffling undead, which cause quite the issue with regards to escaping. However, the 'T-Virus' was not the only genetic monstrosity umbrella were working on...Resident Evil (1996) is hands down one of my favourite video games, well... ever, and back in 2002 I was so excited to see how a film adaptation would turn out. Initially I was pretty disappointed, as at first glance this has little to do with the game and seems like a generic zombie cash in on the name. However, revisiting it some 23 years later highlights that in fact quite a few of the core game concepts are here - the mansion serving as a front to a secret lab, secret passages and doors, a double cross, zombies, genetic tampering, mutated abominations and a viral outbreak that infects the workforce.The film incorporates a few ideas from some other games too, such as the lickers from Resi 2 and an underground train that has appeared in more than a few entries over the years. It feels like this film has taken ideas from the games, and has made its own thing... and even though that annoyed me at the time, these days I'm fine with that.Source material aside though, the film is unfortunately a bit of a mixed bag. There are a few good set-pieces, such as the laser room, the escape through the sewers and the fight on the train, but the whole film looks cheap. Sets are sparse and bland and even though the practical effects are fine, the CGI is absolutely AWFUL. Try not to cringe when the licker is on screen! The performances are decent if not outstanding, and I'm not quite sure why we needed Alice to do Matrix style kung-fu on the zombie dogs. Eesh.All in all I must say that this film has grown on me over the years, but it's not exactly great... which is a shame as Event Horizon proved that Paul W. S. Anderson has great horror films in him. I just long for a film that actually follows the first game's story, with its ridiculous Scooby-Doo plot and various assortment of disgusting monstrocities. Giant spiders and snakes please! PLEASE!!! As it is, Resident Evil is not quite good enough for non-fans to stand out among other zombie horrors, and it's not faithful enough for long time fans...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hey, the first game to movie that doesn't suck!","Though definately not an Oscar winner, Resident Evil is an enjoyable zombie flick. Though it mostly borrows it's material from other horror flicks, it does have something original. A heavy metal track. In a horror movie. Heck, if it wasn't called ""Resident Evil"", I would have thought it was an action movie. Of course, this sometimes causes trouble. Like how the music sometimes totally drowns out the dialog. Then again, there isn't much dialog. Since the characters are pretty much storyless, when one of them dies, you can't even remember his or her name. Kinda sad...However, the zombies were awesome! The extras actually looked liked the living dead, with CGI making it seem as if they were missing skin. The zombies waddled around (like they should, by the way) more or less aimlessly, trying to eat the people (nobody can remember their names anywho). The Licker was something else, though! The amount of time they must have put on it was extensive, because it moves swiftly and, in a strange way, gracefuly.I guarantee you that this movie will make you jump a couple of times. Thinking about it, I remember how every time something scaring would happen, everyone would jump out of their seat and land with a ""poof"". Kinda funny...As for RE fans, only the ""Hardcore Fan Boys"" should be disappointed. You know, the ones that wanted an exact recreation of the first game. But wouldn't it be lame if you already knew what would happen?As a final note, go see this movie if you like zombie flicks, RE, horror movies and movies in general. It won't disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brainless violence and not much else...,"I am a huge fan of video games. I love the medium just as much as I love movies, but when a couple of people up at Hollywood decided to merge the mediums together, 9 times out of 10 the merge turns out to be a waste of time and money. Your money, that is. This movie is nothing more than a cheap cash-in on a great series of games. It is a huge disappointment on a vast array of levels.The only area this movie prevails in is it's action, but even that area is in really rough shape. The action is violent, gory, and devoid of all intelligence. The action ranges from some neat zombie vs. human confrontations, such as being the human's being trapped in a sewer and zombies are approaching from all possible sides, but at other times there are some real stupid sequence taking place (Kung-Fu lady vs. Zombie Dogs!) that are really embarrassing. Plus, the action gets really stupid when the CG starts to kick in, given that the CG looks dated compared to today's modern video games. No joke.All other areas in the film really suck. The story is bogus, disjointed, and incoherent. The acting is bad (probably intentional, given the voice acting in the games is bad as well), and the production values are not as high as they should have been. To top it all off, you get Paul W. S. Anderson, a man who has brought more shame to the movie industry than Nixon brought to politics. His stupid one-liners, dumb cinematography, bad editing, and pitiful script should be the prime examples in this country's film schools on how NOT to make a movie.To be honest, I had a little fun with this dumb movie. With all the absurdities and such, I just decided to make a joke out of the movie and not take anything serious at all. I think I wound up liking the film because of that.All in all, Resident Evil is a corporate cash-in on the name that really dose not deserve such a bad adaptation. Unless you desperately want to see zombies get their fillings of brains, just avoid this film unless you really want to see it.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The beginning of an entertaining saga.,"I've always loved this movie on at least some level. Sure, the CGI effects haven't aged all together that well, but it's important to remember that this movie came out about twenty-one years ago. Lots of fun and engaging zombie/monster action and cool camera shots/angles. And I love Milla Jovovich as Alice, as well as Michelle Rodriguez as Rain. This movie paved the way for a franchise I've always liked, as well as a number of similarly entertaining video game adaptation movies. It also features the Red Queen, who is one of my personal favorite villains/anti-villains in the action/horror genre.

"Fan of The Games or Not, This Movie Still Sucks","I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil video game series and zombie movies. Now, while I could start off this review criticizing the movie for having almost nothing to do with the games, I won't because that is the least of this movies problems. If you've ever wondered why video game movies suck, look no further than Resident Evil.Every problem that a video game movie has ever had is here. A thin plot, bad acting, lazy directing, crappy dialouge, bad effects, I think you get my point. Now, as with most video game movies, the flaws I mentioned about were to be expected and I figured that the movie would at least have some good zombie action. I couldn't have been more wrong! The action in this film is so bag it's almost laughable. Most of the action consist of generic shoot em up scenes and slow motion martial arts type fighting with Milla Jovovich. Thanks to the lazy directing of Paul W.S Anderson, the film is incredibly boring and every scene consist of the same repetitive set up. Characters walk slowly through hallway, predictable zombie jump scare, characters kill zombie, repeat. It grows tiresome fast and I wanted to shut the movie off about halfway through I was so bored. While watching, I was actually shocked by the fact that these movies actually have a pretty big fan-base of people who actually think the story here is good and the characters are interesting. The only positive things I can say about the movie is that it does have a good setup and Mila Jovovich looks hot as hell.Despite most of them being duds, I do believe it's possible to make a good video game movie. Resident Evil however, is only going to convince people that it's more impossible than it was before.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

pretty entertaining flick,"Resident Evil is not a horror film.  It is a zombie flick.  And it is based on the intriguing idea behind a video game.With this in mind, I rented the movie with my best friend.  After hours of having sat behind my boyfriend in boredom while he played Resident Evil on Dreamcast, I wasn't expecting much.  However, as several other reviewers have said, this was a welcome surprise.Milla Jovovich is more than adequate as a heroine, and the plot thickens as is appropriate for an action flick.  What works in the movie's favor is that it actually feels like a video game.  There is atmosphere and pressure, thumping climactic music, zero character development, dialogue pared down to the essentials, lots of shooting, lots of action, lots of locations, lots of zombies... all the comforts of Playstation, without having to move your thumb!What genuinely moved me was the direction of this movie.

Who the heck is Alice?,"Resident evil 2002 reviewHello. This is the resident evil movie franchise. And this is its story. The start of its story. It was conceptualised as an adaptation of the ""Biohazard"" horror genre video game, renamed ""Resident Evil"" for the global market. Paul Ws Anderson, director of the successful Mortal Kombat movie, was chosen to spearhead the project. But something seemed wrong. The characters were different from the game. Changed. Unrecognisable. It seemed as if he read the synopsis at the back of the video game box then tossed it out in favour of his own script. A script. Consisting of dialogue as silted as the first paragraph of this review.Considering that the games were never well liked for their characters' flowery discourse or Shakespearean soliloquy, the creators of the movie cut and pasted elements from other movies in Paul Ws Anderson's DVD collection then give it some cosmetic do-over to resemble the video games. Special force team sent to deal with an unknown threat in a cavernous facility? Aliens (which Anderson is unabashedly a fan of). The facility is ""alive"" and trying to kill you? Event horizon (also directed by Anderson). Actress Milla Jovovich in a skimpy red dress, combat boots, scenes teasing near nudity and doing all sorts of nimble kung fu to show off her lithe hot body? Straight out of Anderson's wet dreams. Jovovich plays Alice. Who the heck is Alice? We do not know as she's got amnesia. But clues to who she is are sprinkled throughout the film and it is fun to piece it all together by the end. What can I say? Other than that, Alice is a blank slate audience surrogate. The ultimate escapism protagonist titilating the men and allowing women to feel empowered by how she maintains her stunning beauty while fending off shameless groping perv.....I mean, shambling groups of zombies which only appear more than halfway through the movie.For much of the first half we are treated to a whole sequence of a special forces team breaking into a dark scary mansion to find Alice and another guy named Matt. The mansion is a cover for a hidden entrance to The Hive, a massive underground facility that had been had been mysteriously sealed. The artificial intelligence Programme dubbed ""red queen"" had killed all personnel in the hive and it was up to this special team to find out why. This is essentially a modernised haunted house story with the ""house"" being the hive and the red queen springing traps to kill the intruders. Though lacking in actual zombies, the film maintains a brisk pace and an increasing sense of dread as we descend further. The appearance of another amnesia named Spence compounds the mystery when they learn the lockdown was initiated by a virus outbreak and the red queen was merely acting to contain the virus.When the action kicks in, it is fantastic. Sure the characters do some silly things that fly in the face of common sense but the fight scenes are well shot with tight angles and claustrophobic feel which heighten the sense of panic when facing the zombie hordes with no escape.The mystery story is well plotted and shot but the experience is dampened by some of the corniest special effects even for a movie of its age. Near the end, they have a run in with a Super powered Monster rendered in the worst cgi ever. Why they decided to use rudimentary computer graphics instead of practical effects, puppetry and make up astounds me. The creature never blends with the rest of the footage and the disappointment is that it could easily have been done with a stuntman in a suit or animatronics.With an eventual resolution leaving more questions than answers, RESIDENT EVIL is undoubtedly a fun guilty pleasure. It does not follow the story but retains the tone of the games. A shallow superficial plot is at least held up by consistent tension and decent pulse pounding action. Once you can forgive all the familiar elements borrowed from other movies, RESIDENT EVIL proves itself to be a decent start to a Long running science fiction horror franchise.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
sometimes the formula works,"""Resident Evil"" is true to both the spirit of zombie movies and to the console game it was based on.  If either of these criteria drew you to the film, chances are you were not expecting a profound exploration of the human condition anyway.  The film delivers precisely what it promises.  This movie is a bloody exposition of special effects and super-models with fire axes. If neither appeals to you, stay at home and read Dickens.Beyond this, ""Resident Evil"" relies heavily on tried-and-true formulae for the horror and action genres.  Things jump out.  There are loud noises. Blood gushes.  We have close ups.  We have slow-motion.  The plot twists aren't exactly the end of ""Usual Suspects.""If any of these things bother you, then the volume is too low and it isn't dark enough in the theatre.  Subjecting ""Resident Evil"" to a cynical criticism of its stock elements is like drinking your beer warm and then complaining because it tastes bad.  Accept that this is not Hamlet, and enjoy ""Resident Evil"" for its loud and expensive applications of horror/action traditions.  It's sleek for a zombie movie and very good for a movie made from a video game.  8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Classic comeback of 80's genre,"Be-sides all the mistakes in this film (several clear 'boom mike shots', dozens of scenes were the top of the camera is visible and I think in one scene you can hear someone else, not the cast, talking) Resident Evil is an excellent film. The film captures the game, full stop and the special effects are king. The film has that same edge to the 80's zombie flicks ('Day of the Dead' and 'Dawn of the Dead'). Creepy music an eerie feel and plenty of 'trippy' camera views and angles. The zombies also resemble 3rd generations from the classics and everything seems plausible. This is definitely a film to watch. Roll on 'Resident Evil: Nemesis'",,Anonymous,Horror

"Formulaic & generic, but has its moments","Video games turned movies have always had a pretty spotty track record as most fail to satisfy its fan community as well as deliver a well-made film in general. None have been more notorious than Paul WS Anderson's Resident Evil film series. It all begin with this flick that was supposedly originally intended to be a tie in prequel to the games but later branched out to its own continuity. That does make sense for this film as there's no characters from the video games. I give it to Anderson for trying to make something that has its own identity, but the final result is a pretty by the numbers horror action popcorn movie. The story is forgettable & lightweight & action scenes are filmed basic and bland with barely any blood to give a spectacle. It doesn't help either we're stuck with the queen of all Mary Sues in films Alice! To be fair it makes sense for Alice to be a bit boring in this film due to her being brainwashed and learning of all what's happened. But it still doesn't make up for the fact she's able to learn using a gun so quick as well as jump kicking in the air like a female Bruce Lee. The side characters are nothing but generic Commandos with no distinctive personalities, the only standout being Michelle Rodriguez as Rain. Not to mention many illogical moments like how one character can become a zombie instantly from being bitten while another takes about 20 minutes to turn despite being bitten twice. And don't even get me started on the countless cheap jump scares.The movie however does have a few highlights. The best scene to me was when Alice fights a pack of zombie dogs and its solid cheesy fun. The makeup on them also looks really nice and you do feel a lot of hard work in the craft with other makeup and sets in the film. Another highlight is the appearance of the Licker that should hype up most Resident Evil fans despite the dated CGI on it.For the average movie goer this is a fine film to turn your brain off to. If you're a fan of the video games then there may be some things to enjoy about it. Unfortunately it would only grow worse from here.....",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very intense,"I gave this movie a 9, but I don't rate movies in the usual fashion.  I don't think horror movies should be rated against all other types, just themselves.  It's a much more raw form of entertainment and it often fails to deliver.  I think the director, Paul Anderson, summed it up effectively in this quote, ""We tried to put into the movie that constant sense of dread and foreboding. As you play the game, as you're walking around, you're terrified as to what might happen next. That's the kind of tone of the movie.""  He is correct.  I do not hang onto people during movies, yet I had my husband's left arm in a death grip for more than half of the flick.  I may be biased in that I feel there is no other concept scarier than zombies-beings whose ONLY objective is to kill you by eating you.  Very loudly.  Ewww.  I have never played the games, since I'm a chicken when it comes to horror games, and my brother had.  I asked him what the plot was to get a feel for whether or not it was an accurate depiction.  He had very VAGUE ideas about the plot.  I was able to fill in the blanks.  I know more than he does because I believe Anderson set out to clear some things up.  I believe it only makes the movie better.  Sure there are one-liners that aren't stellar, but it IS horror.  You have to expect a little cheese with your flick.  I honestly don't think the ending could've been any better.  I was very entertained.  If you check out my other reviews though, I'm no major critic.  I go to the movies to be entertained, and I usually pay matinee price, as I did that day.  I can't say I would've loved it as much if we paid 6 more bucks to get in.  As I always say, sit back and relax. It's just entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Perfect fit to the Story line!,"When I saw the trailer, I thought it was going to be more imitation of the Matrix, but I was wrong. This movie starts the game off but in another facility which may have been a plot hole since the personnel get turned into zombies, someone would notice that tons of people are missing. The plot is simple and looks like it did come from a B- video game, but hey not all video game plots are complicated (like many people complained about Final Fantasy). The movie itself was not as gory as some may think (Romero wanted stuff like dogs biting through the back of a commando to rip out its heart). The reactions of the commandos when first encountering zombies was perfect since they had no idea what they were getting into. The makeup for the zombies were great especially those that could dislocate limbs for the added effect. Nice! The Red Queen keeps you guessing whether or not it is evil or good or just doing what it was programmed to do. The licker, although did not totally look like the original from RE 2 (and this is before it mutated), it still looked cool. When it mutated, oh my, makes fans ask ""Why wasn't it in the game?"" The ending which may be obvious but I won't say PERFECTLY sets up for the games to begin and it also answers some mysteries namely the ""Nemesis."" Kudos Anderson, you made a video game movie worth watching.",,Anonymous,Horror
Waste of time.,"The only reason I can think of giving this film a rating of 2/10, is that number 2 was even worse. Just focusing on this one, the story is so basic and weak, the characters are rubbish, the special affects, the zombie's, the action were abysmal. The idea of the character 'Alice' was useless, if you played the game you would know their's no character named 'Alice', and there's no need for 'Alice' as their were several characters they could of used from the game. Besides Michelle Rodriguez the acting was below average in fact the only thing worse, was the directing. Paul W.S.Anderson my nominee for worse director. I can't actually believe the studio's have allowed for further instalments of this shocking movie, which is supposedly based on the 'Resident Evil games'.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
pretty damn good,"I think it's a pretty good movie over all but a pretty crap imitation of the game.  It would of been much better if it was just like the first game. The action's pretty good but i think it's more of a horror movie - makes jump quite a bit.  I would definately recommend it if you've never played the game, but if you have, this might be a disapointment.  The zombie's look pretty real, but the licker thing, just looks too 3D'ish.  And also, I don't see why this is rated R, it's MA here in Australia, but the point is that there's not even much gore at all!!!!The sequel looks like it's gonna be pretty damn good though!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

I realize that a movie cannot be the same as a video game, so I didn't have that expectation.  The opening of the movie if very intriguing, but once the assault team enters it the movie goes from bad to worse.  The ""evil computer"" subplot is ridiculous, the fact that ""bullets don't seem to stop them"" yet that is exactly how they stop them, and the entire virus plot is contrived.  The ""scary"" parts of the movie where you are supposed to jump are so obvious I didn't even blink. I give this movie a 2 out of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tasty old school Horrorpicture,"At first, don't expect any surprises of this Movie. Its a straight made, oldschool Horrorstory about a Team which enters a freaky Area and gets decimated. Except the fact that Millaaaaa (YESSSS;)!) doesn't remember who she is, there aren't many new fresh ideas to see. But that's not bad in this case. This movie doesn't try to be innovative, it is consequently straight. There are no senseless talkings, no absoutely stupid love story and noone acts like a fool just to make something bad happen. But bad things happen, and every bad thing that happens is made with much love. There is this really nasty Horrormaincomputergirl which shows a really beasty behavior, there are those lovely undying zombies, those really dangerous looking creepdogs and this odd monsters from these crates. Sounds really ridicoulous but its good mixed and everything fits.I think it's like eating at Grandma !

Resident Evil: The Movie is just a waste of what could have been a great adaption if stayed true to plot of the original game,"This movie is pathetic. Anderson has bought to life a boring, stereotypical 'blockbuster' type film which is an insult to the original games. Being a huge fan of the games, by the way, dating back to 1996 when it was first released, I know what I'm talking about. In this film, Anderson has developed his own ideas into the world of Resident Evil and created what's known as 'The Hive'; a 'never heard of before' top secret laboratory located in a beehive-like facility under Racoon City. First off, I must admit, that the beginning of the film is impressive - with the suspenseful clip of the virus being handled by a white suited scientist provoking fear and excitement. Also the introduction of the 'Umbrella'Corporation is pretty interesting. The whole idea could've worked, I suppose, if Anderson had made the trademark zombies look moreterrifying than just using extras with bluish coloured skin and tomato sauce slathered across their face, uttering 'Ohhh, Ahhh' and walking like they're either elderly or disabled. The 'Licker' in this movie looks like a bloody cartoon! I almost laughed at the image of it eating that dude on camera, it looked ridiculous. Also, Anderson used what looked like Dobermans' covered in a layer of barbecue sauce to portray the 'Cerberus'; which again, I laughed at when I saw it at the cinema. There's not even mention of a Tyrant in this film, which is again, a total disappointment, as Tyrant's are the the ultimate enemy in each and every Resident Evil game. Anderson should have based this film upon the original video game. Somewhere dark, haunted, in an old mansion. He should have used zombies that looked like decomposing corpses, which sound like a bag of crushing bones with each step they take, instead of stupid people with blue makeup running around sounding as though they're having an orgasm. Characters from the video games would have also been nice in this film, however Anderson, in his own little stupid world, creates 'Alice' and a bunch of commandos who invade 'The Hive' and then just try and escape again. In conclusion, I'd like to state that I truly believe this film (and later its sequel Apocalypse) could have been a lot more successful in they stayed true to original plots of the first and second games. I would have enjoyed to see that Spencer mansion explored much better than the Hive, and would have been more excited and scared by watching zombies that actually look dead and that are frightening. I don't think it was necessary for Anderson to make this into another stereotyped blockbuster film, as it already had an incredibly strong fan base and would have become a cult classic if it told the story of Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield's survival within the Spencer Mansion in Resident Evil 1. I wouldn't recommend it to any one who is a fan of the games as it's insulting and you'll only end up being frustrated at Anderson's lack of respect to the games' honour.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Pure, unfettered, sh*t","This movie was terrible by any standards. As a stand alone film it just lacks any dramatic tension or suspense. As a film of the game it doesn't work on practically any level. It has a completely different atmosphere, cast of characters and plot to the game. With most computer games you might think that this is acceptable, but resident evil was so great because it actually had a good plot and atmosphere, it was a pastiche of zombie horror movies such as dawn of the dead and evil dead (old mansion out in the woods). This movie has none of the values of the original games or movies, its a true popcorn movie, by the end you feel like you have eaten so much rubbish that your burps smell funny and you feel like you are going to be sick.

"""Night of the Living Dead"" meets ""Return of the Living Dead 3""","I've never played any of the video games, and I'm not one for artsy-fartsy stuff, so from an entertainment standpoint, this movie was superb.  Nonstop thrills and frills.  With awesome special effects and a fantastic group of actors, this movie is a must-see for all Resident Evil, horror and/or sci-fi fans.The movie stars the lovely Milla Jovovich as Alice, a woman who was the victim of short-term amnesia and was suddenly drafted into an odd and unusual mission not meant for the-light-of-heart.Ms. Jovovich's co-star, the equally lovely Michelle Rodriguez as Rain, a no-nonsense, hardened, gonna-kick-your-ass-if-you-look-at-me-wrong kind of woman.  Armed with a machine gun, she was not about to let anything get in her way.Together, along with a few other military agents and Matt, a man who is not who he claims to be, they fight their way through Umbrella Corporation to complete their mission and eventually to save their own lives.All-in-all, this movie was fantastic.  Solely for its entertainment value, I gave this movie 9 out of 10 stars.

Just what I expected,"I am all about Resident Evil; I have played and beaten every game in the series.  Perhaps I have carry bit of a bias.  Anyhow, I took my lady friend out to see it. I will admit that near the beginning of the film I jumped more than she did, and she called me out on it too.  I was happy with the start, middle and finish of the film, it rolled right along.  The plot also contained nice little twists, which actually made for a pretty good story. However I was a bit disappointed with the suspense of the film.  While it did have some moments that kept your heart beating loudly and strongly, I just felt like it lacked the overall suspense that the games held.  Being a big fan of Dawn of the Dead (zombie killing classic), I didn't know what to think of the zombies in Resident Evil.  I would describe them as an army undead tenacious Heroin attics, refusing to be taken down.  You can tell director Paul Anderson had some influence from Romero's masterpiece Dawn of the Dead.  There is a scene in RE that is nearly lifted right from Dawn of the Dead (the near suicide attempt if you are familiar).

Satisfies the fans; and scares the others.,"As common knowledge has it, Resident Evil is based on a computer game from the same name, which, due to its success, and Hollywood's last fashion of bringing to the big screen wether it is computer games or comic-book heroes, Was brought by competent director Paul W.S. Anderson into a gore filled film. As I stated before two probable reasons stand to explain why the computer game was transformed into a movie: First, as Resident Evil was one of the most profitable computer games ever, a movie adaptation wouldn't take very long. Second as lately many computer games (Mortal Combat) or Comic book heroes have a movie adaptation (X Men; Spider Man), Resident Evil - The Movie should be coming any time now. Frankly, I've never played the game before, although I've knowledge of it, which is why I know how the main story goes. Perhaps what is more noticeable is the sense of claustrofobia that not only the actors, but the viewer feel 2km underground. When we get into a movie like this, we already know, we're not going to see some masterpiece, the screenplay will not be something amazingly deep, but one can tell that was never the intention of the producers. Their intention was undoubtfully to suck the viewers in, make them jump, scream, sweat tremble, laugh and become frightned. If that was the intention, congratulations, you made it. Kudos, mainly to the Director. If the intention was some underlined one, like character development or story's depth, they failed. But as the intention was the first one, then Resident Evil, is one of the most enjoyable and job fulfilling movies recently. The cast is not exacly big stars, with the exception of Milla Jovovich, but that doesn't matter all that much because the movie was an enormous success, mainly because of the talent of increasingly rising young stars, like Michelle Rodriguez, James Purefoy and Eric Mabius. Finaly, what probabily shocked people the most was the completely opened end. That doesn't mean anything else than ""sequel next year"". B-movie? Yes. Funny? Sure Enjoying?

Resident Dreadful: Appalling video game film as vivacious as a rabbit punch,"Almost a year ago, I compared the two video-game movies ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Final Fantasy"" to Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston, respectively, because ""Raider"" had annihilated ""Fantasy"" in the summer box office race.Now the latest to step between the ropes is ""Resident Evil,"" also based on a popular game series, and it's easily the Mike Tyson of this genre. You're probably thinking, why? Is it a heavy hitter that boasts a knockout punch? A movie that mows down everything in its path and leaves the audience awed and asking for more?Not even close. Simply put, it's because it bites.What's wrong with this film can be summed up in one word. Everything. ""Resident Evil"" is a painful, slow-moving exercise in sheer torment for every single one of its 100 minutes. Never before have I groaned in agony, buried my face in my hands and shook my head in disbelief so often in a single movie. ""Evil"" is so horrible, it should be used by police as a confession extractor. There is not one redeeming quality to be found whatsoever.Is it frightening at all? Yes, it will be for those who go into this dreck expecting menial details like a decent story and acting.Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson (not Paul Thomas Anderson of ""Magnolia"" fame), spun straw into gold with ""Mortal Kombat,"" but doesn't make lightning strike twice as he again eschews a competent script in favor of flashy visuals. In this case, it's gunfire, zombies, short dresses, speech-drowning music, poorly developed characters, bad editing, plus more gunfire and more zombies. ""Evil's"" lethargically-paced wreck of a plot is composed of long sequences showing people skulking through quiet, deserted locations, looking alarmed at every little sound, before unleashing loads of ammunition. Then the process is repeated minutes later.""Evil"" opens with an explanation of how scientists and workers at an underground laboratory called ""The Hive"" are suddenly exposed to deadly chemicals that look like neon mattress springs. This biological disaster has transformed everyone into  surprise!  flesh-eating zombies. (What were you expecting, the Rockettes?) Responsible for this havoc is the Hive's supercomputer, dubbed the ""Red Queen,"" who sounds like a high-pitched HAL and is represented visually as a small holographic girl. Don't ask.Enter Alice (Milla Jovovich), an amnesiac since collapsing unconscious in her shower. After changing into a Sturgis chic outfit of a very short red dress and very tall black boots, she spends an eternity investigating a huge mansion before abruptly being captured by a team of soldiers and taken to the Hive, where she's joined by another hostage, Matt (Eric Mabius), plus old flame Spence (James Purefoy) and tough-chick cop Rain (Michelle Rodriguez). As if you couldn't guess already, they combine forces to investigate the Hive and fight off the unimposing zombies, whose extent of a makeup job looks nothing more than having their faces covered in flour with a blood capsule to chew on. (They can also survive as much as five gunshots, yet are instantly dispatched by the undersized fists and feet of the female leads.)The pasty-faced automatons express more excitement than the actors who sleepwalk through their equally lifeless roles. Purefoy is the lone player who isn't a total laughingstock. Mabius is gifted with lines like ""She's right...we're gonna die here,"" in between repeatedly shouting the F-word for no reason. As usual, Rodriguez simply overexerts herself: ""After this...I'm gonna go get laid."" Her face is again frozen in her trademark head-down, eyes-up sneer. (Does her head slope downward because her protruding lower lip adds extra weight to it?)Entertainment Weekly recently stated that Jovovich ""could be a knife collection away from becoming the next Angelina Jolie."" It seems they forgot a few things: marketability, athleticism, and charisma. Little details like that. Jovovich doesn't yet have the star power to successfully carry a movie on her own. She sees only a mere thread of action in the whole film, including the much-publicized and dopey sequence in which she battles Dobermans who look like they've been doused in spaghetti sauce. She is stone-faced in a majority of her scenes, and lacks vitality in any physical activity such as firing a gun or fighting off the zombies. When she does emote, it's in a silly moment where she pleads with a wounded soldier who insists on being left behind.Anderson tries to hide the lack of depth in the script by constantly putting characters in compromising positions in order to utilize the ever-predictable jump-scare tactic. They're always reaching a hand out conveniently close to something that, in turn, you know will suddenly grab them. Plot expositions suddenly pop out of the blue, courtesy of cumbersome flashback sequences as Alice gradually regains her memory. Considering its intense buildup, the monster known as ""The Licker"" has no impact on the film at all. And on a local note, what was up with the San Francisco backdrop if the film takes place in (fictitious) Raccoon City?The worst part of ""Evil"" is courtesy of editor Alexander Berner. After a despondent scene where Alice and Spence hover pensively over the body of a main character's relative for several minutes in an empty office, the very next shot is a jump cut of them frantically running for their lives in a totally different location before pushing through a door and slamming it shut. I sat aghast as I wondered how the director could be so blind to allow such an ugly transition to get into the final print.Capping off this unabashed embarrassment is a miserable ending so obvious in touting  God help us  a sequel, that it might as well have been announced in huge letters on the screen.Listen up. There is an outstanding movie called ""Tomb Raider."" Buy it. It has a plot. It has a script. It has exhilarating characters. It has a brain. It was the best film of 2001. And it is more than light years ahead of this apathetic mess. To call ""Resident Evil"" a better film in any regard is sacrilegious. It's like saying the Cowsills are a better rock group than the Beatles. Keep your distance unless you are willing to sit and be tortured into submission for an hour and a half.

A shockingly good interpretation of the games.,"We all know that there has so far not been a single decent movie based on a game. Of the most recent efforts, Final Fantasy was little more than a kiddie version of Aliens, whilst Tomb Raider was incoherent overly-sanitised nonsense quite obviously made by people who haven't played the games.The makers of Res Evil, on the other hand, are clearly fans of the games. This has allowed them to bring the forboding atmosphere of the the titles to the film. Initially designed to be a prequel to the games, Res Evil begins in the confines of the Hive, an underground research facility belonging to the menacing Umbrella Corporation.Whilst the film starts prior to the first game, the end of the film skips over the body of the first and second games, and finishes at the beginning of the third, paving the way for the sequel, Nemesis.The performances of the main characters are good, with a standout performance from Jovovich, as the Amnesiac operative of Umbrella Corp. As a bonus, in addition to her fine performance, Jovovich also spends much of the film either wet or naked!The effects are absolutely superb for a film without a blockbuster budget. Indeed, the effects for The Licker, the film's main villain, is actually far better and much less artificial in appearance than some of the Godawful CGI in blockbusters such as Star Wars Episode 2, and Spiderman.The pace of the film is also without fault, with the relentless action and tense sneaking around gripping the attention of the viewer, and never letting go. When packaged with the great effects, good performances, and excellent atmosphere, I have no hesitation in recommending Res Evil without qualification.There is one point of note, however. Some people I know who have seen the film but not played the games have enjoyed the film a little less than fans of the game. This is probably due to the back story the games provide. So, I'm giving this film two scores:If you've not played the games - 7/10 - An above average thriller. If you have played the games - 9/10 - See it now!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Despite a top-line cast (including Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Colin Salmon and Martin Crewes) and excellent production values, Anderson's movie replicates the computer game's limitless excess, and reduces its characters to the status of zombie fodder, despite a handful of plot twists which set the dwindling survivors against one another as the zombie hordes descend from all sides.

The Best Movie ... EVER!,"This has to be one of the most stunning, well done movies I have EVER watched. I love the featurs in the film, they were simplying breathtaking. Yeah sure some people might be disappointed that the characters dont relate to the game, but who cares? Why watch the same old story from before with the same characters we already know a ton about? This new unique characters keep you hanging on whats gonig to happen next with the all important T-Virus that all us gamers know about.The Actors deliver a stunning performance for a fairly decent casting job. Michelle Rodriguez (Rain) and Milla Jovovich (Alice) are both awesome in this film. But I really admired the performances by Martin Crewes (Kaplan) and Eric Mabius (Matt). Martin Crewes should have a really good career in front of him, and it looks as Eric will be back for the second film. Besides that you had James Purefoy who also had a decent performance. But The Casting was just a little of how aweosme the film was.Now I'm not going to spoil the film for those of you who havent saw it so I really cant take about some of the kick ass things involved with the film. Your going to hear alot of rememberable quotes from both the Red Queen, Kaplan, and Michelle Rodriguez. I gave this movie a perfect 10, and I wouldn't give many movies an 8 let alone a 10. But this movie really deserved it. Paul Anderson is definatly a good director.Rent, Buy, What? You ask this qusetion, this movie is a definate must see. I bought the movie the second day it was out, after already watching it 2 times, and I've probably wasted the last week or two of my life away watching this film over and over. Id say ive watched it a goo 20 times. So even if you dont like the general thriller, this movie is for you. Its packed with action as well and has a few ""scary jumps"" along the way! Go Get It Now!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Welcome back, Paul Anderson!","This movie just plain rocks!  It has great blood scenes, great cast (Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez), great music (Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Madson), and great story (written by Paul Anderson).  It's a great movie-adaption from a video game.I was so happy to see Anderson back on the director's chair. The last time he taggled a movie based on a game was 1995's ""Mortal Kombat"" (which I consider to be the best movie-adaption from a game.  The sequel was good too).  But, the last movie Paul made was 1998's flop ""Soldier"" (which was also good).  Even his 1997's ""Event Horizon was also good.  Not only that, he also wrote and co-produced the movie.  His first time writing and directing a movie since 1994's ""Shopping.""If you think ""Resident Evil"" is gonna be better than ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Final Fantasy,"" you're right.  This movie is heart-pounding from beginning to end.  Check it out.One last note to Paul Anderson: BRING ON THE SEQUEL!!!!  And make sure you write and direct it as well.A+ 13/13 ****** (out of ****** stars)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A B-Movie Lover's Delight....,"This is not SENSE SENSIBILITY so if you want character development, look elsewhere.  This is for people who like John Carpenter films and genre pictures where all that matters is how the characters will stay alive (or conversely, which will die by the end of the movie and how).I played the game briefly a few years ago and was intrigued to see what this movie would be like -- for what it is, it's good!  A fun (albeit LOUD) popcorn flick that will keep you interested and guessing.  It has some flaws (what were those things in the crates? And how many railroad cars have cargo doors on the floor like that?) but I enjoyed this.  And Milla Jovovitch is a hottie!  Loved how they set up the sequel (which we'll see, I presume, if this one pulls down enough box office).",,Anonymous,Horror
My Guilty pleasure movie,I have a soft spot for this movie yes it's terrible but it's a good bad movie it's the only one that feels like the first game more horror and I don't mind the action it's the lines are cheesy but all the resident evil games are like that cheesy and fun dumb horror action,5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best video game to movie so far.,"I'm going to get to the point on this one.  This was a good movie.  But if you're a fan of the video game and you're one of those nic-pick and this and that, than just stay away from this one.  The truth is that NO MOVIE WILL EVER BE LIKE THE VIDEO GAME!!!  Resident Evil movie is the video game like X-Men movie is to comic.  If you're a fan than take this movie for what it is:  a movie.  Save that ""that can't happen"" or ""that's not the way it is in the video game"" for your friends who care.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Terrible, But Not Awful","I have my reasons. For one, Alice really bugs the crap out of me. She has amnesia, special powers, a bland personality, and a magical ability to stay alive. Apparently, she's a VERY powerful weapon. She's also the main character. ...How's that for a shocker? :oAlice also doesn't really have much of a background story. What's interesting about a super-powered, bland, nearly invincible, amnesic Mary-Sue with no depth? Nothing. She's a waste of time and space. Leon S. Kennedy, on the other hand, ISN'T.

Lacks a Sense of Humor,"This movie (unlike many in this genre) totally lacks a sense of humor. And instead of making the gore and violence comical, it is somewhat disturbing.

Terrible!,"I like horror movies. GOOD horror movies. But in the name of those who have not played the game i can not recommend this film. I almost fell asleep. The whole thing seems to be a pure money-making try. No real effort in it to make it a real MOVIE. Each and every second of it is stolen from somewhere, which can tell much about the attitude of the makers for the expert. Well, I have seen very good re-makes, so this does not mean anything. This could have been a good piece after all. But there should have been any concept in it, and not only cliches. I guess the audience of this film is the players of the game. Those who are very sensitive of logical errors. Well, I lost counting somewhere around one hundred :) OK. It could have been a good movie even with these errors, if the makers had anything to do with suspense. Not only up and down, up and down, monotonously. Fingers appearing on the screen is NOT a terrifying moment. If they make one of it, they destroy the suspense in the film. And that is what they actually did, throughout the whole film. Should it be just a little bit worse, I would have left the theatre at halftime. Yes, there are some good points as well. But miss Jovovich's beautiful body wrapped in a tiny piece of cloth or some good songs can not save the film. This is a failure.Please forgive me for my poor English. I hope you could still understand what I am to say.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Creepily fantastic,"first of all i must admit that i am an avid resident evil player and was skeptic of this film at first, yet still anticipated its release.After walking out of the theatre i was astonished.  I remembered the days when video games first came to the big screen.  I remember the disapointment following such flops as Super Mario Bros., and Street Fighter.  But then there was the satisfaction of Mortal Kombat (not the sequel which sucked hard core) and Final Fantasy: the spirts within.Resident Evil falls in line with Mortal Kombat.  The origional story is kept in tact except for a few details that had to be added to make the movie work.I enjoyed the movie tremendously, in fact a few scenes totally creeped me out, just like the game does, while playing it alone, in a dark room with the volume turned way up.  Although it will always be a trend setting classic, i believe that Resident evil is totally the Night of the living dead of the 2000's...there has not been a great zombie movie since then until now.Recommended to sci-fi fans and gamers alike, and if you haven't tried the game yet and liked the movie, i suggest you get with it.  Both the game and the movie are edge of your seat fright fests that will definately get your heart racing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Resident Evil deviates completely from its source material, but does so with confidence.","No one could've predicted that this was going to be the start of something massive. Regarded by many as the ultimate guilty pleasure series, this first instalment gives us zombies, a badass female protagonist and an utterly convoluted plot. A woman simply known as ""Alice"" wakes up unable to recall her memories. A specialised team take her and infiltrate 'The Hive' which has entered a state of lockdown. Why? Viral breakout obviously. The infamous T-Virus. Fans of Capcom's survival horror games of the same name, will be immensely disappointed. There's no horror, there's limited survival and replicates nothing from the first game. It's simply taken the name and turned into something else. Fortunately, whilst I've played the game and discount myself as a fanboy, I honestly don't mind the lack of replication. Call it a film reinvention as you will. Doesn't stop it from being mediocre though. Paul W.S. Anderson directs what looks like a B-Movie. Cringeworthy dialogue, although with some damn good one liners from the badass Michelle Rodriguez, terrible and dated effects that are incorporated in a plot that finds itself incredibly confused. What seems like a simple infiltration turns out to be a mess fuelled by patchy flashbacks and exposition. Milla Jovovich definitely transforms herself and you can start to see her action stardom manifest. There is an almighty personality switch where her timid and quiet self transforms into the ultimate badass b**** in town. She does not give a flip what you think. She kicks a zombie dog in the face for Christ's sake! I appreciate the usage of props and makeup, but simple aesthetics does not create a good film. Mediocrity at its finest.

I have a new favorite...,"I am seriously shocked.Let me just state that I usually respect other's opinions, and I understand some people just may not like this movie, but I have to wonder just how in the hell someone could have disliked this movie enough to make negative comments on it at a website.Ok, so maybe they don't like horror movies. Then why even go see it? Why even make a comment on it if you don't like horror movies?Maybe they wanted the movie to follow the game...uh yeah, great idea. Instead of the original take on the storyline, let's have a recreation of the scenes in the game, since you know, everyone wants to already know what's going to happen.Maybe they felt it was just too devoid of any depth. This one I'll give some credit. This movie is slim on character development, but it's a horror movie. Anyone who has played the games know character development isn't high up on the priorities. To me at least, the games atmosphere and just all around feelings of something wrong is what makes me enjoy it. I am a zombie movie fanatic. But, strangely enough, I HATE with a passion the comedic zombies, like the ones in Dead Alive. I'm into the feeling of doom one gets when seeing the beginning of Day of the Dead, with the ravaged city overrun. You know, the armageddon angle of the Romero films, or the ending of Fulci's Zombi.Back to RE. Whatever reasons there might be for disliking this movie, I can safely say that if you're reading the comments for it, you've already seen it or you're at least a little interested in the genre. In that case, you won't be disappointed. I went into it expecting another shoddy game-to-movie translation like Street Fighter or some other garbage. What I got is one of my all-time favorite horror movies(Yeah I said it). This movie takes the atmosphere from the game and goes a different direction with everything else. It's either fast-paced action or tense scenes that really convey the feeling you get when playing the game, walking through a deserted hallway wondering what the hell is gonna happen next. But on to the part that solidified this movies position in my all-time favorites list...The ending. I have read some of these comments bashing the ending, and honestly, what the hell? How is this a bad setup to a sequel? I rank this as my favorite ending EVER. Yeah better than any other movie I've ever seen. I'm not saying everyone's gonna love it that much, but I did. The music kicking in at just the right time, the carnage-filled streets, it all fit together perfectly, and I haven't been looking forward to a sequel this much in a LONG time. As long as Paul Anderson keeps the same style throughout the second one, this movie will be THE zombie movie. I guess I just don't get how someone could say the ending is setting up a sequel that will be ""even worse"". I am looking forward to where the citywide destruction angle goes VERY much...In closing, give this movie a chance. I'm not saying hail it as the greatest film to ever be created, or to hate it like alot of these other comments would have you believe you should be doing. I'm saying just sit and watch it for yourself. Maybe you won't like it. But maybe you'll love it like I did.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Disappionting for fans "".",This movie spoils the RE franchise by adding a underground train station in the famous mansion that does not exist in the video game and featuring a different outbreak of the t-virus.Alice (Milla Jovovich) is a good slick character but the rest of the cast are just dire.The movie features a lot of inept events such as the laser sequence which is not very resident evil at all.The action scenes are dull and leaden.The scare factor is low compared to the games greyness.Overall an inept display of tedious action but the ending is attractive and hoping the sequel will be to.,5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underrated zombie film,"Sent in to discover the cause of a communication mishap, a woman and a commando team discover a chemical weapons facility testing a deadly virus has turned the staff into ravenous zombies and must find a way out alive.This was quite an enjoyable if slightly flawed adaptation. Among the better qualities on display here is the rather impressive bureaucratic stranglehold on display that truly gives this a great feel for what kind of obstacles to overcome. The systems here are quite fun to overcome in the house' security offers a rather intriguing start here that goes along quite nicely with the system underground providing plenty of thrilling times here with the laser grids, control panels, supercomputers and high-tech containment units give this an effective base along the way to string the action off of. Those are quite fun here with this one providing this with its best features from the different encounters here really making for a thrilling time as the first encounter in the storage rooms where not only is the team overrun on all sides but the ineffectual methods to deal with them cause some explosive action with the swarm closing in around them as they fire away fruitlessly before escaping, a fantastic scene of the group escaping into the tunnels swarming with the undead through the sewer with them and leads into the frantic escape through the central station crawling with zombies all around them. This one also goes for some great action featuring the mutants as well with the scenes of the security office with the mutant dogs or a rather impressive brawl with a monstrous licker on-board their transport train so there's some rather nice diversity amongst the action within here. As well as the great-looking gore and zombie make-up here, these issues make this one enjoyable enough to hold off the few problems in here. The biggest issue in this one is the fact that this one makes a rather curious decision to knock off most of the rescue team in the house before getting to the zombies held on the lower levels. While this here does allow the film some gore while off the defenses quite nicely, the fact that these scenes take kills away from the zombies and creatures later on does seem a little unfair to feature here so that there's hardly any time here to survive to get attacked with such a small group of targets left. This really could've been solved easily by either eliminating the number killed off there in the site or have bigger team sent in initially and it solves that easily. As well, there's the fact that it plays a little too loose with the rules of infection by showing several who are turned quickly while others who are bitten repeatedly take forever to turn simply due to storyline needs despite the continuous bites meaning it should've occurred even quicker than it did previously. These, along with some shoddy CGI at times, does hold this one back somewhat.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not the worst horror movie...,"...but pretty close. Paul Anderson turns out another pathetic movie, this time however, he decides to taint the zombie genre. This movie is nearly unwatchable on every level. The worst part is probably the script. Many of the lines would seem stupid even in the video game that it is based on. Furthermore the exposition scenes are handled with the subtleness of a high-school student film. Anderson ""borrows"" liberally from much better movies such as the classic Romero ""Dead"" trilogy. If this movie does nothing else, it should prove that Paul Anderson should never be allowed on a movie set ever again.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great transfer from game to film.,"It's been quite a while since I first heard of the Resident Evil movie. Back when George Romero was writing a script, and Samatha Mathis from Broken Arrow was going to play Jill Valentine with Bruce Payne as Wesker, I was excited.  Then things seemed to fall apart and the project was in my mind trashed.Slowly things came back together.  A new writer, director, cast, and so on help to bring my confidence back.  Even though the cast seemed to lack a little bit, and the characters were not the same, I was still excited to see the movie when it finally came out this past Friday.Although I understand this could not be considered a great movie, I was very much satisfied with the transfer to film of one of the greatest video games ever made.  I was disappointed with the changed characters, but the story was very much there.And the special effects and gore were excellent.  I was especially impressed with the dogs in how closely they resembled what you see in the game.Needless to say I was happy with the results, and look forward to the sequel.

Great Conversion From Video Game To Film,"There is a lot to say about Resident Evil, it is probably the best video game to movie conversion that has ever been released. Then again there has not been to many in this genre, one such attempt was Tomb Raider and the Movie was horrible. Anyways this movie has a great story line and a original idea for the enemy in the film. Special effects were another strong point of this film(especially the laser scene). But despite all the things that Resident Evil did well on the screen there were a few weak points. One area being the cast, I believe there could have been a stronger cast constructed for the film, not that the cast for Resident Evil did a bad job but I just personally believe it could have been done better. And if your a Resident Evil video game fan which I am, I was a little angry with the fact that the movie sort of did a combination of the first and second Resident Evil Games, I personally believe that they should have made two separate movies because the games had such great story lines, but with that said Resident Evil did a great job overall and I can't wait to Resident Evil: Nemesis. - R.F. 2003",,Anonymous,Horror

Finally...a decent horror flick!,"Well it's about time! After plunking down good money to sit through crapola like ""The Haunting"" and ""The House On Haunted Hill"", it's refereshing to see a good horror flick come out that caters to this generation of ""it's gotta be loud and it's gotta move fast"". I would never compare this film to a ""Night of the Living Dead"", but I will say that for the matinee bucks that I paid for it, I got every cent worth.I went into this film really looking for a good escape. I had very low expectations and really almost considered not even seeing it. But the main character is pretty hot and the trailor looked somewhat decent so I figured I would give it a shot. I'm glad I did! Low on plot development and high on pacing, this movie takes you on a good ride right from the start. Not being a ""gamer"", I had no idea what the video game is about and so I didn't really know what to expect (unlike ""Tomb Raider"", which I did know a little about, and WOW did THAT movie suck?). I was pleasantly suprised by the way they introduced the main character. She doesn't know who she is either, so as the film develops we learn more and more about her and this makes it easier for the viewer to fall into the general plot of the film. Very nicely done! The opening sequence was very cool! Stealing a bit of Stephen King's ""The Stand"" opening, and making it even more horrific.The meat and potatoes of this film though is the audio. I saw this film with Dolby Surroundsound and it really kicks butt! The music is loud, there are movements behind your left ear, then it drifts over to your right. When a zombie drags a hammer on the ground, it really makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. Kudos to whoever did the audio mix on this film! It is done to perfection! And the soundtrack is a perfect match for the pace. Marilyn Manson did this movie justice!Another added feature to this movie, and it didn't occur to me until after I read some of the other reviews here on IMDB, is that there really isn't a lot of gore in this film. No blood splattering moments added for gratuitous reasons. Everything is suggested, which IS sort of odd for a modern day horror film. But sometimes suggesting it (such as the elevator scene starting the film) and/or showing it then cutting away (such as the now famous ""slice & dice"" scene in the hallway) are a much more effective way of freaking a viewer out!Overall, I put this film up there with some of the all-time great popcorn horror films such as ""Aliens"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", and ""Maximum Overdrive"". Not a lot of thinking involved, just get ready to be freaked out a little bit and have a great time!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good B-movie fodder; will make a fun rental.,"As much as I enjoy high-brow cinema, I also have a soft spot in my heart for shoot-em-up SF escapism.In my mind, ""Aliens"" from 1986 is still the best jump-off-your-seat SF scarefest of recent history.  ""Resident Evil"" doesn't even come close to the level of techno-thriller expertise of that older movie.BUT: Resident Evil is a lot of fun, and should please many zombie fans.  The story is a treatment of the classic zombie formula: trap some unwitting people in a closed system with flesh-eating dead people. Add some action sequences, some people-muching gore, and a couple of motivation twists to make it spicier, and you have the usual zombie stew.What makes this better than a C-movie Romero flick is the special effects wizardry, and a little more character texture than most Saturday afternoon zombie flicks.If you're looking for some fun B-movie escapism, and don't mind a couple of slower scenes, then you should enjoy this flick.  I can't say I want to run out and buy the video game now, but I certainly did get some good jumps and good ""grosssssss...!"" factor from Resident Evil.3 stars out of 5.p.s.

Top-Notch Zombie Movie,"Regardless of what anyone says about this film, I enjoyed it. It had me jumping out of my seat and held my attention with ease. The acting was a little shaky and the dialogue wooden but the action set-pieces were great. If I had one criticism for the film is that it wasn't gory enough - for Zombie movies to fill their potential, you have to show them to be at their most frightening, which involves feeding and just generally gory stuff they get up to a la Romero, In Resident Evil you don't really see the zombies feed - they are just there to be shot.Paul Anderson does a more than good attempt at a world-renowned game, but with a bigger budget and a better script, it could of been up there with the likes of ""Night of the Living Dead"".

A secret experiment. A deadly virus. A fatal mistake.,"I am a fan of the Capcom Resident Evil video game series by playing all the mainline games to know the characters, the story, and how they connect to each other, but also, they are fun horror survival games to play that are creepy and unsettling; so, having director Paul W. S. Anderson direct this movie adaptation did not give me hope for the movie, but I went into it with an open mind for it to be a good movie. The movie Resident Evil (2002) was a bit disappointing because it had potential to be better than it was, despite it not being good, it was not bad either by having generic new and different characters, mediocre CGI effects, editing and cinematography that makes the action scenes hard to look at times, small moments where it is accurate to the games, and new things added that tend to not make sense; if the editing, the performances, the writing, and the direction was better, then this could have been a good adaptation, or at least a better movie.The movie consists of new characters made for the movie, such as Milla Jovovich as the lead named Alice, who is ok in the movie with her character not remembering details about who she is and what connection she might have to the Umbrella Corporation; I would have liked more in her performance and a bit more of an explanation when it came to the reveal of who she is and how she knows about the T-Virus. The other character is Rain played by Michelle Rodriguez who could have also given a better performance, because she just acts angry about everything throughout the film where it can get a bit annoying to watch with her being part of the military force that breaks into The Hive, along with her not having that much characterization to make you care if she gets killed off or not by these zombies or mutated monsters. Lastly, the rest of the characters that are part of the military are just there to get killed off by the infected or any defenses in The Hive, and there are two other people with them; one has a connection of sorts to Alice and the other has some kind of connection to what the T-Virus is and why it was made.The zombies and zombie dogs had a little bit of practical effects but mostly had CGI on them that was noticeable, and the completely mutated creatures were done with dated CGI that could look cool, but could too fake looking; also, a new antagonist for this movie is this AI for The Hive called the Red Queen, which is shown as a red hologram with decent CG, who will go back and forth between trying to kill the characters to helping them escape in a confusing way. The way the action was shot when they are being attacked uses some shaky camera at times that can make it hard to watch, but it will occasionally hold on to a shot; what frustrated me was that this movie was not scary, and it had a lot of false scares/jump scares with an annoying loud noise that plays every time, that is because the games never did that while you were playing and it was very creepy to experience.The movie Resident Evil (2002) had potential to be better than it was, despite it not being good, it was not bad either by having generic new and different characters, mediocre CGI effects, editing and cinematography that makes the action scenes hard to look at times, small moments where it is accurate to the games, and new things added that tend to not make sense; the film has an occasional entertaining moment and fun enough creature encounter, but the rest of the movie is a bit generic. For those who have not played the games, the movie is standard, and for those who are fans of those Resident Evil games, you might be split on it like I was; I would rather stick to the games because at least know what to fully give you, while this film gives you some of it but not all of it to leave you satisfied.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good zombie flick.,"'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is my favorite movie in the series.If I had a chance to see the 4th film, which was animated, then I would probably like it better since it got a good score on IMDb.But anyway, I can't say that the first was as good as the second, but it still is a nice piece of film.Fans of zombie movies and video games shouldn't be disappointed.What can a person not like about this film? Sure, it may not be as good as 'Dawn of the Dead', but it's still a zombie movie, and a good one too.What the movie really needed was some gore.There was a little blood, but I love to see a movie with people being torn apart by zombies.Lucky for me, the 3rd film managed to fix that problem.Bottom line: 'Resident Evil' is a good zombie film with a terrific performance by Mila Jovovich.The sequels are better, in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
an another blockbuster from Paul Anderson,"Usually with action movies people come out of the movie theater very excited wait to tell their friend about how great the movie is, but this movie was the best action horror out of 2002. It makes you wanting more, Milla Jovanovich did a great performance and the movie is not predictable that's what makes it even better. it's not cheesy too like some for an example not all the stars make it out alive. So I got to say is if you like gore action SCI-fi you will love resident evil I give this movie a 8/10",,Anonymous,Horror
Quite Interesting,"There is an biological outbreak in a secret underground lab called the Hive,Owned by the huge Umbrella Corporation, who run a large amount of Raccoon City. The virus reanimates the dead as brutal zombies, and when a special op team are sent into the quarantined Hive to assess what happened and shut down the security system, they place themselves in extremely bad danger. Joining them is Alice, a security guard whose job it is to keep the Hive secret, who has lost her memory due to exposure to nerve gas after the outbreak. The second best character is a brave, sassy op nicknamed Rain. Watch the movie to see the story develop. It is a must see!!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a Shame.,"It's disappointing when a successful computer game franchise is brought to the screen in a disappointing fashion and that's exactly what's happened here. When a Resident Evil computer game comes out, it's a bit of an event especially to the die hard fans of the series. I, myself own Resident Evil 2 and have played every single title at some point down the years. This, you would suggest does not classify me as a die hard fan and you're correct but what I am quite a large fan of is survival films such as '28 Days Later', 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Dog Soldiers' so watching 'Resident Evil' was pretty compulsory, fan of the games or not.Everything was set up nicely, the situation was clearly established as it must've been tricky to do a first Resident Evil film, especially after several games; 'where do you start?' springs to mind. However, what follows is a case of 'where do we continue from?' The film seemed to get into a gear and just stay there the whole time. I grew tired of the same location over and over and the way all of the characters look the same. There was no real suspense, no real monsters from the games, no real proper weaponry, in fact the whole thing just dug itself in and stuck itself there for two and a bit hours, a real shame as there was some potential what with the games creating such a success. We aren't treated to many of the games characters either and for most of them, I couldn't really care less if they survived, there is even a temptation to hope that they all snuff it anyway.In fact, the ultimate irony is when they actually get up onto the street surface which is where I wanted the film to take place. This would be fine except: it happens right at the very end of the film! A lot of damn good that is! The REAL survival starts just as all the other rubbish ends. I really can't see the point of this film as from what I understand, with the second film street based, this is just a break in for the absolute non-fans of the game who won't mind not seeing the characters and monsters from the game because they won't even have played it! Where as for the fans, no matter how large or how small they are; they're guaranteed to be disappointed.How ironic- aiming a film based on a successful gaming series at people who AREN'T fans of the games.I didn't enjoy this that much, I'm afraid.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Who doesn't loathe zombies?,"Don't expect a whole lot of oscar winning writing here, but I found this movie to be extremely interesting.The acting is actually good from some actors and moderate on others, and some of the lines are a little hammy, but overall the movie is terrific horror film.  I found myself consistantly frightened during some points of the film, and when I wasn't, it was certainly a pleasure to watch the kinetic Milla Jovovich preform.The soundtrack was at times inappropriate.  The special effects often obvious, and there was a hint of predictability, but surprisingly (due to the fantastic direction of Paul Anderson) I still found myself jumping.This movie was worth my 5.50, and I think it is well worth yours.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
wow....,"One Deadly Virus. One Deadly Mistake. Umbrella corporations have accidentally released the deadly T Virus in their technological research center, The Hive. As it spreads through the many floors underground, people turn into savage flesh eating demons. Then we meet Alice. After being dragged down into the Hive, she faces horrible flashbacks of what has happened. With a special team,they must destroy the red queen- the super computer thats gone homicidal. An adrenaline pumping gore filled horror Shocker. ************************************************************************ So...Heres my comments. I have never played a Resident Evil game in my life, so i cannot tell you if it is anything like the Game. all i can say is, this is one pulse pounding horror movie with plenty of shocks and gore thrown in. I was on the edge of my seat. I cringed, I gasped, and when the film had finished...i was left feeling rather queasy. Milla Jovich was brilliant as Alice. the poor young woman dragged down into the hive and has to face flesh eating Zombies, Demon Dobermans and strange newt like creatures that reminded me of Abe from the Abe's Odyssey games. Soon, all the cast are being killed off. (3 are killed in a space of 2 minutes- really cool scene with lasers). Dont expect to much from this film. It was based on a game. Some of the acting was quite woody, But Milla Jovich and Michelle Rodriguez shone in the fast paced horror. Perfect entertainemnt for a saturday night. Definately not to be watched alone.....Keep the lights on and a cushion handy...and perhaps a sick bucket.",,Anonymous,Horror
So it has begun. Press start to begin.,"Located in Racoon City is the Umbrella Corporation headquarters, where in an secret underground compound called the 'The Hive' one of their experiments known as the 'T-Virus' is unknowingly released. So the main computer system ""The Red Queen"" locks everyone in ""The Hive"", which the virus turns every living thing in the facility into fleshing eating zombies. So, a military crack force is sent in to shut down the main computer and pick up any survivors within three hours. One of them they come across is Alice who's suffering amnesia, but she slowly starts to puts the pieces together, while confronting this massive problem.I remember when I was originally going to see this at the cinema, but a friend of mine conned me out of it, in which we saw the sentimentally, wretched war flick ""We Were Soldiers"" instead. Well, I finally got around to seeing it after all of those years and well, meh! Now I just wonder what got me interested in it in the first place. I'm no fanatic of the video game and I have no idea how true it is to the story, but from what I've seen of the game. Anderson was no were near in capturing the dark and creepy atmosphere. Alternatively he brings his loud, rapid and glossy stylistic touches that find its way in most of his other films. I actually don't mind his earlier efforts like; the enjoyable rubbish ""Mortal Kombat"" and the mildly creepy ""Event Horizon"", but this project and even more so ""Alien vs. Predator"" I found mindlessly under whelming and kinda flat. Sure, I'm not expecting a meaningful masterpiece (although some specifics and character development wouldn't hurt), but the entertainment factor is rather botch. Maybe if I saw it when I was initially going to, I might've got more out of it and see it in a different manner. Since obviously its aimed at a certain target audience and to make a profitable franchise. I just found it far from gripping and the involvement was really lacking. That can be contributed to the story (which has decent plot device) that seems to go nowhere and the stock characters are pretty vague with their cheesy one-liners and thin dialogue.Well, since that was the case I was hoping the action, blood splatter and zombie madness would spice up this shindig! I'll admit the film has a couple of striking set-pieces and the pace keeps the film moving, but these aspects lose out to the ""Look at my shinning new toy! I don't know how it works, but it looks great!"" attitude. The film visually looks good. But it just got caught up trying to be too flashy in it's snazzy techno appearance than actually executing some tension, excitement or even some gore. Instead we get cheap jump scares that are plain predictable, lame slow-motion, tame combat and pretty clumsy, looking CGI. You got the usual chaotic editing worked around the slick camera-work that captures the crisp art direction. Surrounding these glossy fixtures is an impulsively, blaring techno mental soundtrack. Style definitely wins out here! The performances were rather vapid, though Milla Jovovich fits the buck in the lead role. She might not have much to do but to kick ass, but she does makes the most out of her undeveloped character. Michelle Rodriguez plays a very lazy stereotype; the tough female soldier who won't take any crap! The characters here actually share a real common interest with those in ""Aliens"", but at least in that movie that had interesting personalities. *Hmm* Now I'm sitting here looking at the DVD cover of ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", which has on the front cover ""Bigger, better, action-packed"". Well, hopefully it lives up to that wrap or, maybe it will be equally forgettable.No way is it awful. But simply, it's a weak and very dumb action-video game hybrid that lacks the firepower and is unintentionally laughable when it came to shove.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
KICK ASS!!!!!!!,"Ok, first of all, Resident Evil is the best movie adaption of a video game ever. Red Queen is one of the meanest villians ever, i mean sending a laser to prepare the elite group for the feasting zombies later. Milla Jovovich clad in a dress a jacket kicking a doberman's ass and snapping the neck of a zombie between her thighs is down right awesome. The Licker is just how I imagined it, much more gruesome than the one from the game. Special effect and graphics were all right but they needed to improve on the movement because you could barely seen the details of the Licker. All in All, I give Resident Evil 9/10, kick ass movie once again.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
An underwhelming but all out horror thriller,"How do you make a video game adaption work, hire Paul W.S Anderson? No that's not it, what about cast Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez? Well no but it feels more promising, oh I know actually, lets just make an all out crazy movie with little realistic dialogue and some poor acting. See that seemed to do the trick because this movie is a poor one, I didn't find it completely bad but it's still pretty bad anyway. You know I'm the kind of film fan who can truly enjoy movies with a premise like this but when they cast the wrong people behind the camera and on it, you just can't forgive the producers for this one. Resident Evil is based on the popular video game of the same name and definitely see's the kind of action you might expect from such, not all together a really un-enjoyable ride, but just a movie that is unlikeable.We see Milla Jovovich waking up and not knowing what the hell is going on, we also see James Purefoy with the same old predicament and both seem to need to know what's going on. In steps a whole team of people who have been sent in to investigate a thing called the ""Hive"" an underground facility that seems to have done some bad things to test subjects and even employees. The film is packed full of insane action, kick ass stunts and zombies (including zombie dogs) and really does pack quite a punch. I didn't feel this film was bad because of the action actually, it is what makes this slightly exciting and at least the movie has a certain horror element too it and can make you kind of jump.It wasn't the directing that made me cringe, it was the writing which seems to rip this movie apart, the cast can seem almost lifeless at moments with this script and the small talk is well, none existent. The cast do give it their best at certain times but in others it can feel as if they are trying too hard to make this dramatic and Anderson does nothing to help them. I think the only real redeeming factors in this are that it is not awful and not even maybe fully bad but still just poor, as I said the fighting and all the things like that are the only things that keep this a float before it sinks into the abyss of movie garbage.As for the actors themselves I can't say I liked any of them, Jovovich is not bad but she fails as her role to lead the movie and ends up in moments being second fiddle to more exciting characters. Michelle Rodriguez is probably more exciting than her but even she can not make this any better, coupled with the writing too, I just couldn't forgive this movie and felt disappointed. The story is played out well kind of full blown just go for it which does work in it's favour somehow, I didn't want any plot for large parts of this because I was enjoying the fighting, there are way too many obstacles set in this movie but I can say at least you get a few thrills and that's what is important.So all in all it is Anderson who truly damages the film, not as much with Jovovich or the cast as they are just sucked into the director's work. I think in fact I know for a fact many will enjoy this and think me crazy for saying this is poor, but just look at the film properly and really don't let it take you for a ride without first showing you its poor skills. I do however recommend this to all horror fans and action aficionados as it basically will do what it says on the tin really, scare and thrill.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great Horror/Action Movie,"I´ve played and finished almost all re games, and although the film is different from the game, i consider it one greatest adaptations from a videogame ever.the story and the characters although they are not present in any of re games, it resembles alot the re style. Virus Mutations, Zombies walking around and showing at the end of the corners, a Badass monster boss, dark lighting, a hot babe running around and shooting everything. This is enough for me to say that the film is faithfull to the movie. Now talking about the movie itself: It doesn´t make your jump of your chair, instead it glues you to it. The plot is great considering this is a horror movie, it´s a much better story than those average teen horror craps like Soul Survivors (blahhh, hate that). The amnesia part was well worked, giving the film a little twist in it´s middle. I give it a 4 out of 5 (a small 4), and would to like to add that if you love films like Evil Dead, Braindead or the Thing you will surely love Resident Evil.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Gore, glorious gore.","Fast. Furious. Fabulous!If you are a fan of the PlayStation game of the name, then you will NOT be disappointed. Unlike most other movies that are based on games (ie. Wing Commander), Resident Evil is so close of the game that it scared me more than the nasties on the screen. Okay, so the plot is a tad thin, and the memory loss thing is just a bit too convenient, nevertheless I enjoyed the rollercoaster ride that this movie provided.In a nutshell its blood, gore, sexy ladies and damn nasty zombies. The movied played out as nicely as the game and so I figured it was a good way to spend a almostly drizzly afternoon.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wait... This might be Chris' blood....,"I don't know if any other movie infuriates me more than this. Well, maybe the sequel. The people in charge in Hollywood don't seem to realize that videogames turned to film have so much more potential than given credit for. That's why films like this don't have a large budget, which leads to idiots like Paul W.S. Anderson getting the chance to direct and write... neither of which can he do.I mean honestly, the Resident Evil video game series does not have an amazing story like some will say. What it does have is many characters that will one day go down as classic heroes and villains, with a conspiracy plot that was original and highly entertaining in how it was uncovered. The was all set in the perfect atmosphere - a creepy mansion filled with bloodthirsty zombies... awesome! That would be a good movie and it is already a great series of games.The only thing this movie has in common with that is... yes, there are zombies, but they're not scary. They look like sick, hungover mental patients who can't do anything. I heard someone once say this movie was the poor man's Aliens. Exactly. Everything about it is just so routine and mediocre, and aside from that the best characters are killed right away and in awful ways. (The laser hallway is among the dumbest things ever conceived by mankind.) Furthermore, the atmosphere of the games is lost in misplaced maniacal techno music...why??I'm not saying that the movie is bad just because it does not follow the games, because the setting as a prequel is acceptable. However, there are several other things that make a film enjoyable, and it just doesn't work here. No good acting leads to lack of chemistry amongst the characters. The pacing is poor, the dialogue is mundane, and it is not scary enough for the horror flick it aspires to be. The director was just lost.Rather than use a great premise, Paul Anderson abandoned it and made something of his own, which isn't any good on its own. I'll never know why they didn't let George Romero make it. And of course, since it was low budget - the film made a profit and they made a sequel. That is why this sad cycle will continue to repeat itself, and the video game movie will forever be wasted.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not a true HORROR film, but still entertaining","Personally, Resident Evil caused me somewhat of a disappointment.  Being that I am a fan of horror and consider myself to be a connoisseur in the genre, I went to the movie theatre with the idea that I was going to see real zombies; such as those in George Romero's trilogy or Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2, even like those in the classic B movie Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things.  But it was nothing like that.On the contrary, the zombies in Resident Evil looked stupid and not scary at all.  What happened to the classic zombie moans and humming?  The facial close-ups?  The gore? The explicit zombie attacks? The loud bites and zombie appetite?  And the list can go on just to compare what a classic zombie movie should be versus the new zombies such as the ones portrayed in Resident Evil where even some of the zombies faces were computer generated.It seems like good horror films will not make a come back to the big screen. There have been many, such as Scream, Urban Legend, I Know what you did Last Summer, Disturbing Behavior, Jeepers Creepers and so many more recent films, but none are true to the genre.  There will probably never be another Suspiria, Evil Dead, Inferno, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Phenomena among others.Now taking Resident Evil from a different point of view: it is an OK Hollywood movie, entertaining and very similar to the video game (T-virus, killer Dobermans, Train, Licker, Umbrella).  Milla Jovovich beauty enlightens the screen and her performance is pretty good.  Overall the film is watchable, not the greatest but still entertaining.",,Anonymous,Horror
What I thought.,"I thought the movie was ok. I thought I could have been better. Also, the movie did have some good things about it because it scared me acouple of times, but that was just it. Another thing is I kind of didn't understand the main plot of the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly Good,"I went to see this movie because I like the Sci Fi genre but cautioned myself to expect to see a bad video-game movie. Much to my surprise Resident Evil turned out to be even better than I had hoped. This movie has plenty of gore, however not just for gores sake but for a great plot line that worked well with it. The plot elements came together very nicely and contributed to a much more plausible zombie story than has ever been done in the past, the corporate security computer ""The Red Queen"" was also a nice touch. Although at times predictable, possibly intentional, it was surprisingly suspenseful. The acting was very good and believable, and for those would-be acting critiques out there this was not intended to be a drama, but an action thriller. As mentioned in another's review, Milla Jovovich is an accomplished actress that I believe made a wonderful performance and not just because she is awesome to look at. I gave it a 9 out of 10 (sorry, very few movies deserve a 10).",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Thanks, but I'll stick to the game","This film opens in the ""Hive"", the massive underground research complex run by the Evil Umbrella Corporation. A vile containing a deadly virus is broken and it sifts it's way throughout the entire complex, wiping out everyone. This, if in all reality, would not have happened if the Hive had not been entirely connected by the ventilation system. But hey, I guess it goes to show, Military intelligence isn't too high in the movie world either.Casting includes Milla Jovovich as Alice, who was found in the mansion suffering from amnesia, but coincidently remembers how to kick ass, and looks great doing it. Michelle Rodriguez is Rain, by far the toughest and sexiest member of the task force sent into the Hive to check things out. A female commando, who knows how to get it done, go figure. And then there are the other guys in the cast who survive past the 30-minute mark, but they're just the bait for the baddies. Most of the movie consists of the main characters shouting orders, and occasionally getting hoarded by zombies. Oh, and there's a deadly laser beam, which is fun to watch for the most unexpected decapitations I've seen. However, I was impressed with the licker, and the ""Cujo"" wanna-be zombie dogs.Director Paul Anderson gives the film a nice Holly' gloss finish. And the music, industrial metal which got very annoying, managed to drown out some of the lousy dialogue. This was more of an action movie than the horror flick I expected, it doesn't even stride with George A. Romero's zombie films.The one thing that messed up the movie for me was the unnecessary last scene that sets up the sequel; you already know (if you've played the game) that one was coming.

Awesome,Resident Evil is awesome. It is the best adaption of a video game to a movie. It is better than Tomb Raider. It doesn't have as many visual effects but it is still better. Milla Jovovich and Angie are really good action heroes but i think Milla is just a little better because she is a newer character. The script for RE is a little better than Tomb Raiders but neither one of them is very good. Resident Evil is an awesome well thoughtout movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""You are all going to die down here""","Reading the summary most of the people probably thing I am all set to bash Resident Evil. Actually I'm taking just the opposite stand because I really loved this movie. Lets just say love doesn't even come close to define my feelings for this movie. Okay, I'll admit, this movie isn't Oscar material except maybe the special effects, but its really a good movie if you happen to like the RE series. Even if you haven't played the games you might just learn to love it.Human struggle for existence against all odds always makes a good tale. But I should say I'm not one for zombie movies. Somehow I find them meaningless. Maybe because playing the games beforehand or the fact that I willed myself to like this movie ever since I heard it was coming, I really liked this one. Another reason for me liking this movie is  Michelle Rodriguez. There can never be a reason not to like a Michelle Rodriguez movie for me. The art direction was awesome. The concept of the Hive was super cool. The dogs were scary. Scarier than the zombies. The laser scene was trend setting. What I really liked was the Red Queen, a holographic representation of a super-computer modeled after the head programmer's daughter. To hear the innocent voice of  a little girl saying- `You are all going to die down here' - is really chilling. That's Red Queen for you.I didn't know anything about the movie before it was released. I just saw its trailer once in UK Top Ten. So, I didn't what really to expect. I was hoping to see all of Jill, Claire, Leon and Chris. I was real disappointed not to see any of the video game characters. To tell the truth that killed me but things like that happen. It seems like the movie is going to follow a storyline slightly different from the game series starting with how the T-Virus spread. In the games the T-Virus was spread by James Marcus (as in Resident Evil: Zero). The movie stand is different. I guess the games and movie storylines will deviate from each other a bit.Glitches? Milla Jovovich is definitely one of the most good looking women in the world. In fact she's stunningly breathtaking. But somehow I didn't see her as Alice. She looks too precious. It might be because of the scene she was introduced in. Anyone who knows Jill, Claire or Rebecca know that they are really tough women. Maybe Milla J. looked fragile to me because she was next to Michelle Rodriguez. And boy! is she tough.I hope I get to see the game characters in some future RE movie (haven't checked RE:A till yet). So gotta go. What am I doing next? Well, to quote Rain, `when I get outta here think I'm gonna get laid!!'",,Anonymous,Horror
God-awful piece of crap movie.,"It's a good thing I didn't pay to see this, otherwise I would have asked for my money back. Quite awful acting on the whole, no explanation of who the characters were (except the main two), complete and utter deviation from the plot of the games, jumbling of details from the games, not nearly enough gore (I mean, there were many awkward cuts to other characters' reactions to violent events), bad attempts at humor, brutal errors anyone could see, the massively stupid surprise ending, and just generally inanity.  The film wasn't the least bit scary, it was a ""Boo!"" film.The worst part is the film seems successful, so we will have another butchery coming up in Resident Evil The Movie 2.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excelent movie !!  A perfect adjustment of the video game,"I am charmed with this movie. it is perfect because to me I am a fanatic of the cinema gore and of terror in general, and also fan of the violent, such video games as the saga RESIDENT EVIL.From beginning until the end, everything is an entertainment, violently, effective, very rapidly and very terrifying. To the beginning of the movie someone (who is not known the one who is until the end of the movie), voluntarily infected with a mortal virus, one makes of Umbrella's experimentation (the major company of the world), called ""the beehive"". All the personnel die agonizing, after moments, bit a bit, and ""the beehive"" remains inactive. There appears Alice (Mile J.) in the shower of the bath, but she does not remember anything of anything. The mansion appears where she lives (identical to that of the video game RESIDENT EVIL 1) and on having tried to go out of the mansion, someone her enters again in the house by force (the first fright). He is Matt Adison. The group of commands appear rapidly, breaking the windows of the mansion. The group of commandos this one led by the commander James (Colin Samon), and formed principally by Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), Kaplan, Salinas, and Medic. The commandos interrogate Matt, he says to them that he is a policeman of Raccon city. nonetheless they take him as a prisoner. Rapidly, and without explanations, the commander directs to the whole group towards a secret door that gives to a species of underground. There in the underground stores (identical to those of a real video game) on having come to the train that joins the mansion with the beehive, they find Spencer Praks (James P.), who also suffers of amnesia.He is the supposed husband of Alice. From this moment, both, Alice and Spencer remember during the whole movie, bit a bit, recovering the memory. The whole group goes in train up to ""the beehive"".

After this unexpected event (and very gore), Alice and the demas, safely someone already, deactivate the red queen (the first appearance of the girl). On the other hand, Rain and two commandos more, together with Matt of prisoner, discover a woman zombie (the first walking zombie, exactly at the half hour of the movie). The zombie attacks and bites Rain, and the whole loader shoots this one, but the bush. There joins to the group Alice and the others, and appears zombies for all sites, surrounding them. There is a great gunfire, but the commandos do not manage to kill to anybody zombie.

Mainstream horror...,"Just got back from seeing Resident Evil. Based on the fact that the theater was sold out for every showing today (including the 11:40pm I went to) I'd guess that it's definitely going to be a hit. It should be. It has everything someone expecting a movie based on the game should have. You have the house (albeit briefly), the dogs, Umbrella Corporation, the licker thing, the T-Virus and, oh yeah, the zombies. Add on some very nice gratuitous shots of Milla Jovovich completely naked and you've got the whole package.What doesn't this film have? Let's see... a well written story, well done CGI, tension, scares and, oh yeah, GORE. Yes there's some blood in it but the camera is always cutting away when a scene that would require gore comes up. Maybe they cut all of the gore to get an R rating as I've read but there's so little that I think it would practically be PG if not for Milla's nudity and the work f**k used 1 or 2 times. How they could have turned down George Romero's script and fired him as director and then thought that Paul Anderson was making a better movie I have no idea.So what we have here is an extremely mainstream version of what Hollywood thinks a horror movie should be. Horror fans will probably be very unimpressed with it. If you've nothing to do and need to kill 90 minutes then there are worse things you could occupy your time with but certainly don't go out of your way to see it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid Film Interpretation Of The Video Game.,"Admittedly, I had my hesitations about this film.  I really, really wanted to like this movie, but the way some magazines and on-line sites were talking about the plot synopsis (a computer turning people into the undead and not the game's T-Virus), I had some concerns.  Fortunately, after seeing the film, my concerns were eased, and such rumors didn't come to pass.This film now resides in my ""Top 3"" (Mortal Kombat and Final Fantasy being the other two) of video game based films.  And this is how the film should be looked at: A film that relies on a video game for its source material and story set-up.  The film starts out slow, offering background information on the Umbrella Corporation, and introducing the viewer to the victims caught up in a situation they were ill-prepared to handle.  The scenes (especially the Hive map layout) are set up like a video game.  Again, for this type of film, it can get away with this and work properly if kept in that frame of mind.  Once the zombies appear, the tone of the film gets much more intense, especially with scenes from some of the game's more ""popular"" enemies.For a horror film, it's not as gory as I would have expected.  It does have its fair share of ""gross"" moments, but succeeds more in some good old fashioned jumps and false ""gotcha"" scares scattered throughout the film. What really surprised me was that the film actually had some brief flashes of nudity in it.  Then again, this really isn't a movie for kids, and I'm glad this wasn't dumbed down to be so.The acting was decent, introducing new characters to the RE world (which kept things unpredictable as to who lived and who died, which made it more interesting in my opinion), and being the same director who did the original Mortal Kombat film, it was filled with plenty of flashy fight scenes to fast music.  What really sat well with me in regards to this film is that the movie made plenty of subtle references to elements from the games (the crows, Nemesis, the mansion, limited ammo comments, etc.) without screaming to the audience ""Hey, this prop is also from the game!  This scene is just like the game!  We included everything whether it needed to be there or not just to keep RE fans happy!""  While I'm sure some people would have delighted in seeing the protagonists pushing around statues and opening doors with playing card-shaped keys, the movie rewards the die-hard fan with plenty of references if they look hard enough.  The feel of the game was captured without going overboard.Granted, some people have likened the film to ""Aliens"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"", but that's something of a moot point.  Yes, there are similarities, and no the story isn't the most original thing out there, but the game series does take inspiration from such films to enhance the tension for the game.  Basing these elements from the game for a movie only makes things come full circle.  The film is meant to capture the feel of the game and provide some entertainment while it's at it.  In that regard, it succeeds in what it sets out to do.So is it worth it?  If you enjoy the games, then yes.  It's fun, it's got its creepy moments, it's got a great ending sequence (excellent ""closure"" for the film, if you can call it that), and hopefully the sequel won't go the way of the second Mortal Kombat film (read: bad).Hopefully, there will be a Director's Cut DVD.  I have a feeling that some scenes were cut out of this.  Excellent popcorn fare, and a future addition to my DVD collection.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worth Buying,"I actually got this on import as soon as it was released on dvd being a fan of the videogames and Event Horizon [Paul Anderson]. Simply put, it is a good film. Various aspects of the videogame are kept in the film, notibly some camera shots. The music throughout the film is interesting and fitting yet can become somewhat tedious. Personally I found that while watching the film, I felt I was alsways waitng for something that I just couldnt put my finger on, then at the end I realised, what your waiting for is the sequel. Now I dont mean this in a bad way, at the end of the film you get a real sense of ""great here's where the action begins"". Resident Evil is only an introduction to the whole resident evil saga, and it fufills this well without leaving you feeling cheated. I was quite surprised when watching, as there is little blood and no guts what-so-ever, so to class it as a ""zombie movie"" doesnt seem right, more of a horror-thriller, which in fact it claims to be. Various aspects of the CGI were inpressive, although I did find the licker seemed to be missing something. Good performances by all the cast, although after watching this you may begin to hate Michelle Rodrigez as, yet again, she plays the same hard-core ""bitch"" with an attitude, at points coming out with some very bad lines. Personally, I'm finding her a bit tiresome. Overall a good movie and worth buying, I tend to also get the sequel on import too, so we'll see how they have handled that. 8/10",,Anonymous,Horror
Game for 'Resident Evil',"Exactly what can I say about ""Resident Evil?"" Well, first of all it's based on a popular video game series, so expect a lot of the action to be the same kind of action you would find in a cartoon. Second, be prepared for an incoherent plot (which is kind of dumb). Finally, get ready for lots of gore.So, why five out of ten stars? It's a lot of fun to watch. Even though it's totally unbelievable, it's somewhat involving (despite, like noted above, the dumb, incoherent plot). The characters are fun to watch, especially Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, who have to be the toughest heroines in movie history.The special effects are very good, as is the enthusiastic direction by Paul W.S. Anderson (who also wrote the script based on his favorite video game). Also, the movie has a fun opening sequence.In brief, the movie is about a super computer in a top secret, underground research facility called 'The Hive' which goes awry, killing everyone down there. However, a manufactured virus brings them (and a few dogs) back from the dead, resulting in flesh-eating zombies.A lot of people might frown when they learn the plot and, eventually, see the movie, thinking it's something too unbelievable. Then again, what do they expect from a movie based on a video game?",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Could have been better.,"My word of advice for Milla, drop the Crouching Tiger flying slow-mo kicks and commit the next flick to realism. As a self-confessed Resident Evil's fan, she didn't stay true to the game, although the atmosphere is almost there.The music was wrong, the characters got killed up too quickly and I only wished they had the original Japanese game developers, to develop the story. The original Bio-Hazard game (the original Japanese game) was just perfect in everything in a movie sense. The suspense, the atmosphere, sound, etc. Oh well, better luck next time.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you love the game, you love the movie!","Friends, Gamers, Fellow movie goers, your friendly neighborhood SmackmYackm had the opportunity to see a special sneak preview of the new Resident Evil movie. Needless to say, I jumped at the opportunity, since it was free.Let me first start by saying that I walked into the theater tonight completely biased and almost hoping for the movie to be a complete and total turd that didn't even deserve to be placed in the porcelain throne. I was totally certain that this movie was going to stink so bad that the stench would rise above the audience like a foul flatulent cloud and drive everyone out of the theater demanding their money back for a movie they didn't even pay for in the first place. Well friends, I was happily disappointed.From start to finish the movie just oozes everything that made me fall in love with the games. From the eerie atmosphere to the jumpy feeling to the hundreds of zombies this movie was from start to finish, Resident Evil. Those familiar with the game will start to see the resemblances right away and continue to see them all throughout the movie. The train, the mansion, the ending that screams sequel and most importantly the walking dead, its all there with the exception of the poor voice acting and the frustrating control scheme. Surprisingly, it doesn't rewrite the story, but expands it. Very easily just another chapter in the story, it could be tied together with the other chapters like a finely knit sweater. Even if you didn't like the game, but found the story compelling, you will like this movie.As a movie it plays very well. It has action, suspense, a little drama and a whole lot of `what happens next'. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time wondering what was lurking around the next corner. The acting was very good considering the fairly unknown actors and the few, which in my opinion just aren't very good in the first place. All in all it is an action movie but does not feel like one. A few scenes suspend belief, but after all it is basically science fiction. No overdone fight scenes or Matrixesque `wire fu' but a whole lot of run for your life. All these pieces come together to make a very well done movie. I also found out that this isn't a `Hollywood' movie so that may have something to do with the reason it didn't suck, but I would like to think that movie producers are finally starting to notice that the movie goers are not all as stupid as they think we are.The bottom line, Resident Evil is a thrill ride good for both movie fans and gamers alike. I myself couldn't have been more pleased and I think you will feel the same. Whether you're a fan of the series or a gamer that would like to see a gamer movie made well or just a fan of the cinema, you should try this one out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Zombies Back and loving it!,"An amnesiac heroine (Alice) and a band of commandos attempt to contain an outbreak at a secret underground facility where the virus has caused the dead to come back to life.It's a surprisingly great Zombie film. Past Zombie flicks have contained a lot of bad acting with low budgets and story lines that weren't that great. Whle I can't draw comparisons of the adaptation into the film Paul Anderson does a great job of creating an empty eerie atmosphere.While some of the CGI effects are an unnecessary distraction the make up and costume design is first-rate. There's an intelligent story and great script. The stunts are fantastic notably the dog attack and the supporting cast are great and the two strong female leads Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are excellent. The music is hard hitting, foreboding which adds to the action and creepy moments.A good chunk of flesh eating entertainment-a great update and revival of zombie movies which pays homage to George A.Romero.",,Anonymous,Horror

TOP OF THE LINE VIDEO GAME ADAPTATION,"Resident Evil is by far the very best adaptation of a video game ever. Everything that was featured in the game is on screen, the story is there and very true to the game. You will find the much loved zombies, the possessed dogs, and the very nasty monster. Milla Jovovich does a great job and shows once again that she is a very strong and physical actress. Paul Anderson directs with pleasure and confidence and it shows in every scene. Yes it does get pretty ugly sometimes but wasn't the game ?. A Lot of people surely won't like it. Even though The film is mainly targeted towards the young audience that has been playing with the game for the past 5 years, it does enter the great horror movie category with a big R. If you like scary movies, great action, and especially are a fan of the game, goo see it, you'll love it.",,Anonymous,Horror
Does not have the quality or the horror of the games.,"Resident Evil is a slick and decent looking movie but it lacks a lot in terms of scares and horror to make it worthy of the video games that spawn it. Milla Jovovich and the cast do well with what is giving, and the movie itself is a good late night movie to watch but it should have been a balls to the wall horror feast that the games were. Of course like all adaptations of novels and games, it does not resemble its forefather in anyway, and it does not retain the sense of terror that the game had in spades. The zombies don't look scary at all, and the hunter looks a fake as a plastic chew toy. Some scenes are good, and the special effects in some of them fit like a glove but overall the movie is nothing more than a decent scary movie that should have been a lot more than it was.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not Too Shabby,"I saw this movie solely on the point that I was a huge fan of the games. I went in expecting a movie based on resident evil but was surprised to find no relation to the games, not even the characters or the infamous Raccoon City. Instead they opted for a new set of characters, and comes off looking like an alternate beginning for whole series. Resident evil has some great special effects and of course fight scenes but the real star of this flick is Milla Jovovich (Alice). As the main character in a horror movie its her job to get the people clinging to their seats while she is being attacked by a assortment of monsters, and pulls it off flawlessly (though I think she would have made a wonderful a Jill). Any fans of the game will want to watch the movie just for the last camera pan out (trust me), but for everyone else this movie does hold its own and is worth a look. I would recommend this to anyone loves a good horror film or just some senseless violence, as for me I cant wait for the next one. (Its in Raccoon city I hope)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"The main actors were excellent, but the zombies were laughable.","After seeing this movie, I had mixed emotions.  The actors did a much better job than others in movies based on video games.  The characters were people that you actually cared about and who seemed real enough to feel like they could be people you know.  James Purefoy as Spencer was especially interesting, adding layers as the film progressed.Unfortunately, the main plot of Resident Evil revolves around zombies. In this day and age, that shouldn't be difficult to make interesting.  A little imagination on the part of the makeup and wardrobe departments and some creative directing could've made this quite exciting.  Instead,I felt that I was teleported back to the 1950's, with slow zombies walking stiff-armed and looking less scary than those in Michael Jackson's Thriller.  At the screening I attended the audience actually giggled at some places in the movie which were supposed to be scary.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who isn't either really bored or a big fan of the video game.

It's hard to believe thay anyone could like this movie,It was a disgrace to the games. The direction was crap Anderson is lazy instead of relying on suspense and atmosphere he relies on poorly executed jumps scares and you don't jump because your scared you jump because they amp the music up so loud you cant help it. There was not one genuine scare in the movie because you don't care about any of the characters they are all badly written clichés. The action was boring and stupid there was one real battle with the zombies and in it they just kept shooting them in the chest magazine after magazine in the chest I thought they were supposed to be special ops a highly trained military force and not a bunch of idiots. The scene were the lead character (who Paul Anderson for some reason thought would be a good idea to put into a tight red dress for the entire movie for no reason) jumps of the wall and kicks the dog was laughable as was most of the movie. Anderson Should be banned from film making all his movies are (in my opinion) unoriginal cheesy and stupid.,,Anonymous,Horror
A videogame flick that doesn't stink.,"The fact that the movie is based on a videogame hurt the movie at the box office because it turns off mainstream audiences. But all the stinkers based on videogames, like Street Fighter and Super Mario Brother, or mediocre attempts like Mortal Kombat and Tomb Raider, had a problem with the translation. Resident Evil in the other hand is a very cinematic videogame, which makes it a natural for a movie translation.Just to say that a couple of things from the videogame would have helped this be a much better movie. Unlike the videogame, the movie environment looks too clean and bright for the horror factor. If you've seen films like ""The Sixth Sense"" you know than an eerie atmosphere makes the movie scarier tenfold. The camera anglesfor the videogame which makes a sense of uneasiness, are very scattered through the movie, and the techno soundtrack, though good in the action scenes, is annoying at some points.The combination of horror, science fiction, and action is not an easy task for any film, which is an effort worth of appreciation for this film. The plot is also interesting, and original though it borrows from other action and horror films.I hope somehow this movie makes up for the cool box office reception on video and by word of mouth. The R rating didn't help, but it was right for the story.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Jovovich v/s Zombies,"Normally I tend to avoid films like 'Resident Evil' unless when strongly recommended enough to be convinced. I'd watched it when it released because my brother kept insisting, telling me what a great movie it was. I thought it was an okay film with a terrible ending. Tonight my brother played it on the DVD and I watched it again as my family as around and I still feel pretty much the same. Though having the company around didn't make me feel like I had wasted my time and a few points I'd like to make about the film.The background score I found to be very impressive. It's one score I'd like to own. The special effects are not that bad either and the sense of isolation and abandon within the building was quite well done. I liked Milla Jovovich's acting for most parts. I think she displays the range of emotions very effectively through her facial expressions and makes Alice different from a caricature sci-fi horror movie heroine.Now pretty much everything else in 'Resident Evil' ranges from mediocre to bad. There are plenty of ridiculous 'jump' giving moments. Though I didn't jump at all, I saw my cousin startle at some scenes. The zombies are laughable. It's extremely Hollywoodish and the ending, though unpredictable, was disappointing and in my opinion, silly.However, I didn't feel as bad as I did after watching it for the first time. Maybe it's because of the company I was in or maybe I just noticed some of the more positive side of the film (which in my opinion is still limited).Ho",,Anonymous,Horror

Ridiculous,"I got to see this movie for free since my best friend works at a local theater. Its a good thing too because I wouldn't have paid over $1.00 to see this crap. I'm a fan of the Resident Evil video games and I understand that the conversion from game to movie is hard. But thats not what made this movie ridiculous, in fact it lines up pretty well with the beginning of the first Resident Evil game, and the movie itself has a good plot. What makes this movie ridiculous is Umbrella's swat team sent in to control the threat of the T- Virus. This is the most absurd conglomeration of soldiers I have ever seen. Most of the people in the squad crap themselves whenever they witness anything bizarre. And Michelle Rodriguez's character ""Rain"" is absurd. Its like Paul Anderson was writing this movie and said, ""hmm I think I'll make one of the characters a ghetto bitch with a bad attitude."" If this movie is anyones fault it is Paul Anderson's. From the opening scene where Rain tells another character to ""blow me"" Resident Evil is full of ridiculous one liners. In fact thats about all of the dialogue. The only real speaking role is that of the ""red queen,"" the A.I computer system that is in control of the lab in which the outbreak has occured. As far as gore and violence go I have no idea why this movie was rated R other than the use of the F word. Anyone who applauds the action (if you can call them that) scenes in this movie is a moron.

Popcorn cinema - simple fun!,"Somewhere I've read that this movie was ""yet another videogame adaptation with even less plot than Tomb Raider""... Actually, that statement is wrong.Yes, it is a videogame adaptation (of a game I never plaid), and it shows. The ""Hive""? Linear plot development on a mission basis (Find the queen - kill the queen - fight the zombies - try to escape -.....)? Creatures just oozing that special air of ""level end boss""? (The Queen, The fellow right at the end, maybe even the dogs).. Yup - it's a videogame alright.But, surprisingly, it is FUN to watch! The plot may be a bit thin - but unlike the pile of bulldung that Tomb Raider had for a story, this movie actually has a lot more charme and skill worked into its storytelling. Of course, it's still far from a proper thriller/drama, but I'd say it isn't too inferior to ""Aliens"" on the level of its storytelling. Definitely superior to Blade 2 - another movie with similar elements.On a visual level, this movie is pure joy. Vibrant colours, amazing creature effects, utterly scary Doberman dogs - yup! These visuals rock! And the action, too, is brilliant, although a few more kung-fu-esque kicking sequences would have been needed. The entry hall to the queen's chamber is definitely an impressive piece of action cinema, perhaps even the best of the movie, although it's a close call. The soundtrack underlines the action, and it fits superbly. If you have seen ""House on Haunted Hill"" it will sound similar, and it definitely enriches the movie.All in all, this is a great summer action movie, looking like a mixture of Night of the Living Dead and Blade 2 - but being better than both at satisfying my tastes. Fun. Fun. Fun.And the ending is very cool, too.....8/10",,Anonymous,Horror
If you don't like the Matrix you'll hate this,"""Resident Evil"" is one of the worst new movies I've watched this year.I got to admit that I'm not a big fan of ""the Matrix"", I don't like the story and I don't like the special effects with slow motion and people running on the walls.The story in ""Resident Evil"" is a bit similar with computers taking control, and the special effects have also been used. One of them is the bullet being fired in slow motion - we have seen it before, and don't want to see it ever again.I also think that the director has been inspired by ""Aliens"", which is a much better movie than ""Resident Evil"". ""Aliens"" is a much more scary movie than this poor movie, and you don't know when the situations will occur. While watching ""Resident Evil"" you'll know whenever something will happen, there is nothing unexpected throughout the whole movie.Do you like ""the Matrix"" you'll maybe also like this one.

Zombies in the 21st century?,"I never thought I'd see another zombie-drama movie after the 70's or after Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"". I think it's cheap, non-sense gross bloody scenes. Weak story basis. Funny when it shouldn't: why is Milla Jovovich covering her private parts when she's totally alone in her bathroom? I think that making a horror thriller is one the most difficult task to do for film makers, but I'm sorry, I think that walking-hungry zombies are far from what people wants to see since the 80's zombies. Without the beauty and charm of Milla it had been a flop.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Needs more gore!,"Could have been better...  The premise is pretty good but the film cops out by reducing the amount of gore in order to get an R rating.For instance, the cool scene showing them getting sliced in the hallway by the lasers, was cropped.  I wanted to see big hunks of meat lying on the floor, yet the camera quickly cuts away so we don't get to see much of anything.  I think a scene like that should be graphic since it shows everything else, short of what's being piled up on the floor.In Anderson's previous film, EVENT HORIZON, the implication (of gore) worked pretty well but not here, imo.  The result being that the scene looks cut instead of implied because the director shows too much restraint.Fear of censorship, Mr. Anderson?  That's understandable since something like that could have qualified for the UK's ""nasties list"", so why not have a director's DVD cut for those who want more gore?And some of the cgi looks sloppy with the torn up faces of the walking dead looking more animated than real.  I think if they spent more time on it, they could've made it look better.There's also an ending that looks like something out of the 70s film THE OMEGA MAN which is kinda cool, too.  We don't get to see too many ambiguous things like that anymore.I hope a future director's cut adds some more blood, guts and gore to it because this EVIL is holding back.5 out of 10 for being cropped",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"By way of being a very loose adaptation of the source material, Resident Evil is fun enough to just about succeed.","Fans of Capcom's best-selling video game series will mostly be disappointed by this adaptation of their beloved survival horror, but by trading scares for shootouts, director-writer Paul Anderson ensures that his Resident Evil is accessible to a wider audience.The first instalment of what is - as of this writing - the highest-grossing video game franchise of all time perhaps benefits from a more cautious budget. Where Anderson would return to direct the later iterations with a frustrating dependence on slow motion effects, here he is forced to think more creatively, drawing inspiration from the fixed camera angles of the games. He wholly succeeds in a slow-burn approach, not revealing the undead until the second act, and his flirtations with artificial intelligence, a concept the video games were never really preoccupied with, is a novel addition. His dialogue may be soulless, but Anderson clearly knows a thing or two about action-heavy set pieces and what audiences want from them. Again as a result of the low budget, there is a wealth of gritty and gory practical effects that lend Resident Evil an air of credibility, if only for trying.Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez elevate the script, which manages to slowly unfold a story intriguing enough to keep you invested for the runtime. It may be flashback and exposition heavy, but there is admittedly a solid character-driven mystery to go with the carnage on show.It's interesting to view this film in hindsight, knowing that it produced five sequels of wildly varying quality, but which still resonated with global audiences who were consistently satisfied with the action. Resident Evil is an excellent case study in how to produce a successful video game; capture its essence, but do something entirely different with it, even if this means alienating the fans for the sake of a wider audience who won't criticise you for getting the source material completely wrong.",,Anonymous,Horror
Zombies thirsty for blood!,"Milla Jovovich has a lot of talent, and has a very toned, HOT, AND SEXY body. HOWEVER, even though Milla is a great actress, and she puts loads of expression into her work, the story need much improvement. Entertaining movie (sort of), a little boring. Some scenes are good visual candy. Milla should be placed in way better movies though. She deserves better directors than Alexander Witt and Paul W.S. Anderson. Believe me, I could... no, a baby could write a better script! The only reason I watched the movie was to see Milla move around that FINE bod! The story sucks, but the acting is actually pretty good. I give it 5/10 because it has some really good ideas, but it just isn't worth watching 3 times. Watch Resident Evil 2. Much better that the first one, but still, lacks originality.

One of the worst films I've seen so far in 2002,"I remember reading somewhere that George A. Romero, the great horror picture director, was originally slated to write and possibly direct the transformation of the playstation video game of the same name to the screen. Then it was also reported that the studio decided to go with another director on the project which to me indicates 1 of 2 scenarios- 1, Romero had lost his edge as a zombie film artist and did maybe write a bad script, or 2 (which is what I believe), the studios couldn't recognize what was possibly an intelligent script in the tradition of his ""Dead"" trilogy (I can only speculate by the way) and decided to go with something that was a lot more dumbed down for their standards.Whichever is the case, this is the result, a zombie movie where, truth be told, the zombies aren't quite the most ominous and terrorsome threat to the people in attendance in the film- a mega computer system in the form of a semi/mute HAL in a military complex is and that is one of many flaws and miscalculations here.  Another is that the script has the dialogue span that a 10 year old would consider short winded (and this is a rated R movie) and development, yes even in action, that is not really good.  In fact, the only thing keeping me from failing this is that the zombies when they do appear, look OK and the laser death sequence is a bit keen.In short, this is the type of living dead movie where you can see what's on the other side of the spectrum of a movie like Day of the Dead (Romero's least effort) where there was more talk than action which didn't work that well and then this where even the action doesn't help to elevate poor writing (at least Day had a memorable ending).  Hardcore Resident Evil fans should stick to the games and movies.  Grade: Between D- and F+",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

A fresh new look to the successful game.,"It seems to me that I've heard many articles stating the Resident Evil movies are ""terrible"" or ""a waste of my life"". There reasons? They do not conform with the game. You cannot say that these were terrible movies just because it didn't directly relate to the game. Would you want to watch a movie that you knew what happened behind every door? It takes the fun out of it. Paul Anderson gave this game-made-movie a fresh approach. Capcom, that creators of the Resident Evil franchise did the same thing when they made multiple spin-offs: Survivor, Survivor 2, Outbreak, Outbreak File #2, Gadien, and Dead Aim. None of these titles have a direct connection with the game; unless you consider the Outbreak series being located in Raccoon City. Resident Evil 4, the most recent released game, has a story line separate from the normal T-Virus/Umbrella story. They do in fact mention Umbrella and have characters from the other games just as the movie does. These movies were made to intrigue the fans of this franchise as well as introduce it to others not familiar with it. In my opinion, these movies are a great installment to Resident Evil and I'm glad I spent time and money to watch them.",,Anonymous,Horror
Whoever gave this project to Anderson should be shot,"No, Anderson should be shot. First he screws up Mortal Kombat totally, and now his horrible directing skills have made it here to Resident Evil.First off: This has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GAME! Ok there are three things: The virus, there ARE zombies, Lisa Trevor is in there somewhere - But she's a computer not a mutated freak.Anderson has never played Resident Evil. There are simply so few references to the game it's scary. Examples: No shotgun (the survival horror's weapon of choice) or Grenade launchers (because every female alive uses one.) And no crate pushing! CRATE PUSHING!The biggest disappointed is easily the fact that none of the infamous bosses appear. No 50 foot long snakes, no 30 foot long sharks, not a single spider, or plants the size of houses. What an idiot to not see that people would hate this. What an idiot with his budget.Oh and automatic weapons are for WUSSIES! You're not a man if you can't take down a zombie with a combat knife!

At Last.An Unironical Horror Movie,"Too long we fans of horror have been suffering the slings and arrows of post-`Scream' crappy, irony-laden, pseudo horror fare. `Resident Evil' is a straight up, no nonsense sci-fi/horror actioner that delivers the goods without tongue firmly (or loosely) in cheek. The film starts briskly, setting up the plot and situation. From the moment the toxin is loosed on the interior of the Umbrella Corp HQ, the flick kicks into a steadily building overdrive, tension mounting all the way.The cast, headlined by Milla Jovovich, is uniformly good, though most of the roles themselves are pretty much generically familiar constructs (tough, gravel voiced CO, hard-as-nails tough chick with chip on shoulder, slightly skittish techno guy; you get the gist). This, however, is not a criticism. In this kind of down-in-the-trenches-type film it works. Though I'm a big George Romero fan, I'm kind of glad the directorial torch ended up being passed to Paul Anderson. Anderson, whose previous films `Soldier', `Event Horizon' (another fine, straight-faced, sci-fi/horror motion picture), and of course, `Mortal Combat', is a deft hand at pacing, building atmos' and showy, edge-of-your-seat cinematic pyrotechnics, and has done a commendable job translating the Capcom computer game to the big screen. Much as I love Romero's work, I think he would have made a more bogged down film. Anderson's is lean, hungry and relentless, but gives ample and obvious props to Romero, which I think is quite suitable. (Note the newspaper at the film's conclusion that boasts the identical headline as the one shown in the opening of Romero's `Day of the Dead'.)Writing as someone who's played the game (why doesn't that sound as impressive as, `.as someone who's read the book?), I appreciated the film's fealty to its source material; spooky game, spooky movie. Really good ending, too.Technically, the effects are all top-drawer, as is the set design and cinematography. My only beef is that at times the thrashing soundtrack (which I otherwise enjoyed and found entirely suited to the material) overwhelmed the dialogue track. But maybe that was just a fault of the sound system in the screening room in which I saw it.All around, `Resident Evil' deserves high marks, and if you've played the game you won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil? More like Resident Crappy,"I know resident crappy isn't even the slightest bit clever but I'm too mad to be clever...This movie is absolutely terrible. What bothers me even more is so many people seem to love it. The subject matter has so much potential which is evident in the games. This could have easily been rated PG-13 if there was one less ""f**k"" and if the producers didn't want you to think the movie had to be good cuz it was rated R. The most fun  had with this movie was when me and my friends were watching it and making fun of all the crappy acting and story. Michelle Rodruguaeauss or however you spell her name..(I'm too lazy to check) always has a scowl on her face like she just smelled something really bad...maybe it would make sense if there were some damn corpses there but there is hardly any gore. And when she says ""When I get outta her I gotta get laid""(or something like that I was laughing to hard to remember.). Well good luck with a scowl like that...ewwwww.

Better than would be expected,"Most video game turned movies turn out terrible. Often times, even worse than that. Here however, it actually turns out alright. Why? Because instead of taking ever bit of the game titles and throwing it into a movie that appeals (and makes sense) only to fanboys, Resident Evil stands well on its own as a horror/suspense movie. To be fair, the acting is pretty stiff. Shakespeare its not. However, it definitely has its share of scares and times when stuff just pops up. The plot is surprising well put together, the music creepy, the zombies (this is a zombie movie in the vein of Evil Dead)well done. Basically, the bottom line is, if you want to go see a classic horror movie redone with Milla Jovovich then its a great movie to see. Its plain and simple fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
'EVIL' : Dead on the Mark!,"I have a friend who when we watch movies, he refuses to watch horror films because they unnecessarily scare him. Yet,the only video game he seems to enjoy playing is RESIDENT EVIL. He still has yet to explain that stroke of contradiction to me. Then again,this is someone who once told me he doesn't wear a safety belt because he is not afraid of dying,but once when I wanted him to go skydiving with me, he turned me down flat because he said he is afraid of heights. Maybe his logic is that he likes to be in control of a situation if he is going to be afraid of one. I on the other hand,am not a huge fan of video games. At least playing them. These days the graphics and sound are so advanced that I find myself watching them rather than wanting to play them. I do however love watching horror flicks. Surely there could be some sort of horror movie that I could take him to see. Instead of just waiting for a follow up to his favorite game, he found out that it was coming to the big screen and he wanted to see it. Being the hit video game that it was,it came as no surprise that a movie version of RESIDENT EVIL would be highly anticipated. Almost everyone would agree that movies based on popular game franchises are not a successful investment. RESIDENT EVIL is clearly the exception to the rule only because its source material already borrows from a popular horror genre. The right director is employed to make the movie work. While Paul Anderson(MORTAL KOMBAT,EVENT HORIZON)will not give you a subtle, thought provoking film in the vain of MAGNOLIA director P.T. Anderson, he doesn't adopt P.T. Barnum's ""there is a sucker born every minute"" school of thought either. The film is well aware of its George Romero zombie roots. It pays homage to it while staying close to the plot similarities of the video game. RESIDENT EVIL takes place mostly in the hi-tech underground facility of Racoon City. The evil Umbrella Corporation has a monopoly on all the world's technologies including nuclear,biological and chemical weaponry. Is this supposed to be a sendup of the Phillip Morris companies? Anyhow, the film wastes no time cranking the action level into full throttle. A saboteur in the research and development department meticulously unleashes a deadly virus(in an opening shot similar to the one seen in HANNIBAL) that will annihilate those exposed and turn them into blood thirsty zombies. The facility goes into automatic lockdown and all Hades breaks loose. Enter the super slick response team set up for failure from the word go. The ""Hive"" is controlled by a HAL 9000-like supercomputer to keep them from getting out. Milla Jovovich(THE FIFTH ELEMENT,THE MESSENGER) and Michelle Rodriguez(THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS)are the heroines who get to do most of the bloody work. sLiPkNoT,Mudvayne and Marilyn Manson,artists who seem to make most of their money playing on soundtracks of horror movies rather than on the radio are on the soundtrack of this one too. RESIDENT EVIL is a fun, in-your-face and ghoulish action pic.

I Cannot believe I Paid Money to See this Garbage!,"The gift of the IMDB is that it gives people like me the oppurtunity to voice his reaction to a film and now I am going to indulge on this privilege. THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN! First of all the music overwhelmed the dialogue: during the action sequences the actors lips would be moving but all you would hear would be the techno-musical score that resembled the sound of a hammer pounding on a bag full of electronics. Perhaps the filmakers were so embarassed of their final product that they tried to cover it up with the soundtrack. Another thing that I noticed was that there were few establishing master shots, so the actors would go from room to room and the audience would not have a clear idea of where they were coming from or where they were going. It could be that the producers didn't want to invest any money into a good production design so we are stuck with tight, cookie-cutter shots of the enviroment. That takes me to the story itself, which is nothing more than elements from other, better movies (Alien, Dawn of the Dead and Outbreak). And worst of all, just when you think it's over, the movie adds on an epilogue to set up a sequel. All I can do is hope that this film losses enough money to convince the producers that to make a sequel would be truly evil.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

And while the makeup wasn't like Tom Savini's work, it was still very good.  When I heard Romero wasn't going to be doing this project, I really was prepared to hate it, but I think Paul Anderson did a wonderful job on it.

An excellent first rate zombie film! **** out of 5,"I love this film. Paul Anderson is a great director. Bold statement I know. A lot of you will disagree with me and I will tell you that you are probably just one of those guys who have seriously jumped on the bandwagon. Because that's basically all that it's amounted to. Paul Anderson has had the opportunity to direct films that have a extremely high expectancy level to them. And this alone is probably the reason he is lambasted so. Because no one can live up to a lot of fan boys expectations.I myself am a fan boy, but I'm an open minded and not such a nit-picky one.Anderson really knows how to construct a movie and tell a story quite well. The scares in this flick are anything but cliché. He knows how to scare us by providing an extremely high level of suspense.The gore is low, and that is my main problem with the film. It's based on a video game that has buckets of it. There is some though. It isn't completely bloodless. But at least there is plenty of suspense and terrific action sequences. In the end that's what really matters.Everything else though works completely. We are introduced to characters we genuinely care about and are sad to see it when they ultimately meet their untimely demise.The special effects are terrific and the music by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson is pulsating, creepy, and very unsettling.It's a superior horror film that I highly recommend.",,Anonymous,Horror

Best Zombie Film Since 1985's Day Of The Dead,"Day of the Dead was the last great zombie film in my opinion and that was released back in 1985. Since then, there have been several mediocre zombie films but this isn't one of them.Firstly, I haven't played the computer game at all so I cannot comment on how it relates to this movie. As a movie, it stands out on it's own.It mixes action and horror very well and the actors and actresses all play a good part. Usually in zombie movies the people battling the zombies have no personality but everyone in this movie does. The military type people make a great impact looking all trigger happy but you soon start to feel sorry for them and care for them as characters. At first you are not sure why some of the characters are there but it's great to see things unravel throughout the movie.This was the first movie in a long time where I kept jumping at certain scenes. I won't spoil those scenes for you but there are some really creepy scenes in this film. The zombies and other creatures in it are probably going to give me and my girlfriend a few sleepless nights because they were so scary.All in all, a pat on the back for those involved in this movie. It was very exciting and I shall probably have to go out now and hire a computer console in order to play the game so I can take part in the action myself.",,Anonymous,Horror

I was thinking ""zombies, bad genetic shennanigans, kick ass girl heroine, if the games were great how can the movie go wrong??"" But it was so WRONG. Where to start?Firstly it took me and the guy I was watching it with about thirty minutes to figure out what the hell was going. Then we realised there wasn't actually a plot to speak of. The script, well what I could hear of it above the LOUD and not very good music (sounded like the directors' three year old kid let loose in a factory of kitchenware) was unbelievable bad to the point where it wasn't even funny. Alot of the talentless cast looked the same so one minute I was thinking someone had died only to see them again (dammit) in the next scene.Then there's the acting. The acting in the game's FMV sequences was like Shakespeare compared to this. Mila Jovavich had perfected a permanently blank expression while Michelle Rodrigez looked like she was sucking a lemon throughout the whole film. The CGI was so bad you could almost see the strings and this is the only zombie film I have ever seen where the zombies were just NOT scary. At all.Every time the Red Queen popped up with her terrible English drama school accent I  just cringed...God there is no way to convey the terriblness of Paul Andersons crimes. At first I was laughing at the badness, watching Mila/Alice turn from blank eyed bint to some superhuman action hero running up walls and killing zombies with her thighs but eventually my laughter gave way to slack jawed amazement at the horribleness of this film.

dull,"Simply one of the most boring, predictable and generally anticlimactic movies ever made, only being surpassed in it' awfulness by it' numerous sequels. The acting is sub-par (even by Milla Jovovich's standards), the plot is laughable, the action is dull and repetitive and the Matrix style bullet time effect is over used.For fans of the games, this film has nothing to offer you. In fact you're likely to end up hating Paul Anderson, that is, of course, if you didn't already hate him for his previous travesties.For fans of zombie movies, this film has nothing new to offer to you. All you will get from this film, and indeed the plethora of abortive train wrecks it's spawned, is an uninteresting rehash of things you've seen before, nothing has even been used in an original way. For fans of horror films, this film contains no suspense and is about as likely to frighten you as offering salt lick to horse is likely to frighten it. This is an action film pure and simple, an all style no substance action film at that.For fans of well-made movies, the genre of which really doesn't bother you, look elsewhere. If you are masochistic enough to feel you that you just have to see this film for yourself don't say I didn't warn you.There is a very special group of people who will love this movie, namely 14 year old boys with below average IQs and way too much testosterone. The only redeeming feature of this film is the soundtrack, but if you like that kind of music you'll probably have every song you hear in this film already.My suggestion save your money and get yourself a tin of paint, you'll have a lot more fun watching it dry than you would do sitting through this steaming pile of horse manure.In summary, the Resident evil the movie will probably go down in history as the most expensive B movie ever made. If you actually liked this film I have nothing but pity for you.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
An excellent horror/survival movie,"I loved the video games and I loved this movie.  I think it upheld the atmosphere of the games and it was a great horror movie - nothing more or less.

It's not Resident Evil.,This is the first Resident Evil movie that started ruining the entire series. This movie should adapt the stories from the Resident Evil games from characters to storylines. There is no such lead character as Alice. This movie should never been created at all.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Recommendation to Players of the Game,"This is one of the better movies made from a game if not the best when it comes to horror and action!  Despite the differences, I was not disappointed and think the movie is a well-done adaption.Resident Evil is a kick-ass, tension-filled, action-adventure experience just like the game.  Excellent visual and special effects, plenty of moments full of terror, anticipation and panic that starts right from the beginning. Let's not forget the carnivorous zombies and vicious dogs as well as a new loathsome creature that will make your skin crawl.  In all that hysteria, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez' characters rock!(If you've seen Thir13en Ghosts, this is similar but better although not as eerie and gory.)This movie is just as entertaining to watch as the game is to play.  I hope the ""game"" doesn't end and that there will be a sequel to this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Take him to the nemesis project.""","Bollicks to you, Glacier.  You talk as if a midget with brass knuckles was punching you in the balls during the duration of the movie.  I'll agree with anyone who says this film wasn't art, but it was NOT a bad movie.  I'm not gonna nominate it for an Oscar, but it was entertaining, and much more so than ""Tomb Raider."" And before we get into the ""you don't know the game"" issue, let it be known that I am a diehard fanatic of the Resident Evil series, having played all of the games, owning two, and having beaten both ""2"" and ""Veronica"".  The game itself consists of walking around rooms being frightened by sounds, and very often there isn't much zombie fighting involved.  Granted, ninja kicks to the heads of Dobermans forced my eyebrow to rise a little, but I let it pass, especially once they showed the Licker (only complaint I have is that such a weak character would be made into the ""boss"").  The special effects weren't great, and I found myself chuckling to myself at the sight of the zombies, but what got me into the film was the constant ambience.  It played just like the game, with more moments where you're scared of the silence than gunplay against approaching zombies.  As for accuracy to the game, it's not all there (if it was, they'd be able to hold eight guns at a time, and eat plants to cure their wounds), but as it is a prequel, it doesn't have much to stick to anyway.  The beginning introductions were accurate, and the ending was seamless, as well as being extremely creepy. And while I had expected to hate this movie, as video game transitions typically suck eggs (i.e. Super Mario Bros), I was very pleasantly surprised, and while I can't repeat enough that I wasn't blown away by the depth or artistry involved with the film, it was a good, mindless, lets-shoot-the-hell-out-of-some-zombies movie.  And if this series which seems like it's gonna sprout is true AND chronological, it's only gonna get cooler.  Anyone who remembers a specific line from the end of the movie, and knows what it's referring to...you know I'm right.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is the worst film I've ever seen and I've seen Batman & Robin,"This movie is awful and Paul Anderson (Not to be confused with Paul Thomas Anderson, who is a much more talented director and even though I don't like his movies I at least appreciate that he knows how to tell a story)has accomplished a great feat by making this movie bad on so many different levels: the plot, the dialogue, the special effects, the acting, the characterization, the gratuitous nudity (while appreciated by the men in the audience was no way justified). If only one of these aspects had been at fault I could have looked past it but unfortunately nothing was handled well. Firstly in an age of digital effects like those seen in Lord of the rings and Spider-man audiences have come to expect good effects not Zombies created with a bit of green make-up and dogs covered in tinned spaghetti the one digital effect they did spend any money on looked like it was created on an etchasketch, I was more impressed with the graphics in the game than the film. I understand the budget was fairly low but even low-budget horror movies have still managed to produce genuinely scaring looking effects, one only has to watch ""From Dusk 'til Dawn"" or ""The Evil Dead"" to see that.The plot's only good point was that it was an original piece of work with nothing I could see taken from the game apart from some of the names and monsters, but if you took away the dogs, the licker, the umbrella corporation and racoon city and called the virus the U-virus or something similar then nothing would remind you even slightly of the game, which can sometimes be a good thing if the writer can come up with an original story better than the one in the game, but he can't, it's predictable (you know who the bad guy is after the first 15 minutes) there is no suspense other than that created by the overly loud sound-track which accompanies ever scare so you can hear the ""surprise"" coming every time. In an age of self-knowing films like ""Scream"" it's hard to believe that it takes the characters the entire length of the film to realize their in trouble and I'm pretty sure the word Zombie isn't mentioned once. This may have been a conscious decision to avoid getting called a ""typical zombie movie"" but that is exactly what the film is so why try and disguise it, there are gaping plot holes that the dialogue tries to cover over but fails, such as how the virus goes from an airborne virus, which would presumably affect the squad, to a contact transmitted one even though the virus clearly needs to be injected into rabbits and it would surely make sense to stay as an airborne virus to reach as many hosts as possible or to engineer it so that it couldn't become airborne from a safety point of view not change from one to the other as it felt like it. The dialogue could have been written by a child it was that simple and very stupid there was no wit, which is a well established feature of this type of movie and of life in general, but none of the characters display this ""laugh in the face of danger"" attitude audiences have come to expect and enjoy. I have read the George Romero Script on the net (although there is no guarantee it was actually written by Romero) and whoever actually did write it isn't important as it is much better than the film, even in it's first draft stage. The numerous characters are all given enough dialogue to give you a 3-dimensional feel to them and all are dealt with in a fitting way, the story is close to the game but still entertaining and suspenseful, the creatures are well used and fit in to the story aptly and while it would have required a much bigger budget it would have saved me the 2hrs of boredom sitting through the filmed version gave. Maybe it is unfair to criticize the acting considering the material they had but nobody made the most of it and there was never any sense that they were real people but instead objects to be dispatched by various badly conceived monsters and awful special effects. I can only imagine all the actors involved pleading to be killed off. How Mila Jovovich gets away with showing so much flesh in her movies including this one is a question I'd like answered especially when it is so unnecessary. I wasn't the only person in the audience who laughed out loud at some of the terrible scenes in this film and I can only hope that Paul Anderson isn't allowed to make any more films although with him already signed on for Resident Evil 2 it seems the movie going public will be bored by his awful movies for many years to come. An man sitting behind me in the cinema commented, once the film had finished, that it was ""The best film I've ever seen"" I can only assume this was the first film this person had ever seen.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
best..zombie..movie..ever..,"I do have one criticism - I have (as far as I know) perfect hearing, so I don't appreciate having my eardrums ripped to shreds by what is easily the loudest film I've ever seen.  Even though I was in an empty cinema (matinees are so cool), the dialogue was at the right volume so there was no reason (other than for cheap scares) to whack the volume up to maximum and make me jump out of my seat every two minutes.On with the praise -The film is pacey, and keeps to a pretty simple but effective plot - very similar (I believe) to the videogame.  A great opening shows what went wrong, and then we're into the action.  There's a clever plot device (oh alright, it's a map), which I thought really worked well to branch the gap between the feel of a computer-game and a film.The actors are unfamiliar-enough that they don't detract, and Milla does a great job as the heroine.  There's a neat little rip-off of a scene from Cube (which is a great film too), and the zombies are really really good.I saw a behind-the-scenes preview with Paul Anderson at a film festival last year, where he explained how much effort went into making the zombies and special effects believable, and I think they did a fantastic job.  I know this will be sacriligeous to some, but I find Romero's stuff way too OTT. Previously, zombies have only really worked in a comedy sense - Braindead, Evil Dead, the Thriller video etc. so it's nice to see them done convincingly.  The dogs look great too.  The Licker looked good, but could have had a bigger role (it reminded me of the monster from The Relic, only naked), but the way they get rid if it made me laugh.Other good things - Milla Jovovich looks fantastic all the way through, and does a pretty good job too.  Michelle Rodriguez seems to be enjoying herself, even if her lines are a bit too Sanchez (from Aliens).  The ending was excellent - really sets you up for a sequel, without feeling short-changed.Apart from turning the volume up to 11 to scare me, my only other whinge would be that one of the squad characters (the whiney one) utters the ""we're all gonna die"" line - but I did appreciate the way lots of other cliched moments were neatly sidestepped.If you want to see a very attractive woman kill convincing zombies in an entertaining and vaguely futuristic action/horror movie, go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Diabolical.  In a, you know, bad way.","During the primary literary phase of its development as an entertainment form, the gothic genre tended to involve a set of familiar ingredients - ruined buildings, virtuous heroines in distress, supernatural manifestations, heroic rescuers and loathsome villains, perhaps with a gang of bandits thrown in.  Even though we call 'Gothic' simply 'Horror' these days, and even though most of us now visit this genre in its new home of the cinema more than on the pages of books, these ingredients have hardly changed over the years.  Resident Evil is fascinating proof of this on two levels.On the most obvious level, for Ruined Building read The Hive - the abandoned but not-so abandoned biowarfare lab which is the principal location of this film.  For virtuous heroine read Milla Jovovich wearing a dress as short as her legs are long; for supernatural manifestations. well, it's a zombie film.  You get the point.On the second level, this film is a bit of an abandoned ruin itself, haunted by the wailing spirit of the film it might have been.  You can see how the crumbling architecture might have formed a magnificent structure at one time - however, what separates this from every other romantic ruin you will ever visit, is simply that most ruins come to their tragic state of disrepair thanks to the gnawing of time's teeth, or violent misuse, and not simply because the owner got some cowboy in to build it in the first place.More of a folly than a ruin, then.  Sometimes this film looks beautiful - the cameraman certainly knows how to present the lead actress in a favourable manner - I'm not sure Jovovich has looked quite so luminous on screen before.  A pity, then, that the film is so awful taken as a whole.This is a film without sense, restraint, inspiration, or even excitement. It's not a good zombie film, not a good action film, and not a good science fiction film.  It has an extraordinary trompe l'oeil quality that does, at times, deceive the viewer into thinking the film has some genuine quality - but it is deception only.What's more, it strikes me as rather bizarre that a film about zombies, with such obvious possible influences and precedents, should come across as being more interested in aping James Cameron than George Romero.  Indeed, it is somewhat pointless since it is neither the first Aliens-wannabe, nor anything like the best-equipped to carry out such imitation; and this supposes that imitating another (perfectly good) film is even a good idea in the first place.The utterly pointless directorial allusion to Psycho which opens the film is entirely typical of the direction; so, like a jackdaw's nest, this film may contain many shiny and interesting things but it is simply a mess.  Unlike a jackdaw's nest it isn't constructed of old twigs or covered in guano, nor has it fallen down a chimney into a fire yet - but we can always hope.I suppose utlimately what I find most objectionable about this exercise, and what makes me dislike it more than many other more obviously terrible films is that watching it you can actually see what a good film this could have been.  This film earns contempt not so much for its mediocrity as for its wasted potential.",,Anonymous,Horror
This is NOT Resident Evil...,"Here's a thought: if you're going to make a movie about zombies, put them in more than two scenes. I am not a big video game buff, but I'm familiar enough with the first two RE games to know that they were scary as hell, had fantastic atmosphere, and much better characters than this piece of trash. Guys- all you had to do was stick to the games! Most of the audience has never played them and you could have thrown in enough surprises for those that had. There is not one suspenseful/scary/emotional scene in this big empty glitter ball of a movie. There's also a surprising lack of gore for a zombie film. And the zombies themselves are laughable...not frightening. At some points you might be confused as to who's a zombie and who isn't because the human characters get about as much development as their undead enemies. Let's start with Alice played by Milla Jovovich. Being that she wakes up with total amnesia, how in the hell are we supposed to give a rats ass about her? Just bc she looks hot in a little red dress? Give me a break. Then there's the cookie cutter cliche group of soldiers. Note to Michelle Rodriguez: wearing a permanent scowl and rolling your eyes halfway back into your head does not make you look tough... it makes you annoying. If she made that ""tough bitch"" face one more time in this film I was going to scream. Eric Mabius has gone from great films (Black Circle Boys, Welcome to the Dollhouse) to all out crap (The Crow: Salvation). Eric, you're a talented boy... stop sinking so low.What is redeeming about this movie? Not a damn thing. The special effects are horrid, the zombies look lame, and there is no sense of dread or danger that the games handle so masterfully. What's the most tragic is that this movie had so much potential. Instead of sticking to its source material they decided to make a horrible little genre pic and stick the RE name on it. Oh, and the film boasts one the single most irritating commentary track you'll ever hear. At one point the director says this isn't a zombie movie. Then Mr. Anderson, you should have let someone who thought it was take the reigns of the film bc it's based on A ZOMBIE GAME. And I have completely lost all respect for the very unintelligent Ms. Jovovich who doesn't even understand how a commentary works until twenty minutes into the whole thing. In a word: insipid. Look it up. If I dislike the movie before the commentary, I HATED it afterwards.Few so-called horror films have ever been this uncreative... and given some of the garbage that's come out lately that's a hard thing to achieve. The bottom line is the movie is not scary. You can throw in the train from RE2... you can plaster some walls with Umbrella logo... hell, give us a few undead dobermans... but that a good RE film does not make. There is no tension, creepy atmosphere, or any believable threat. Fans of the game should skip this travesty.

Not even bad enough to be good,"It had been a while since I'd seen it, and I went in expecting it to be cheesy in a fun kind of way, but it wasn't even that.

It doesn't seem done with any care or love of the source material. This is surprising coming from the director of Mortal Kombat, a movie that, although corny, captures the spirit of the games.It starts out okay with some intrigue, but it spirals out of control. There are some cool moments, by 2002 standards. The laser grid scene is very memorable. Yet that isn't enough to sustain the utter bore-fest that is the rest of the film.It's poorly shot, and poorly edited with continuity errors and outright nonsensical jumps.

"""Do you wish to save game?"" ...Not really.","""Resident Evil"" is a LOT better than I ever hoped it would be and, even though it still isn't a very good movie, that's quite a big compliment. It's based on a video game (Capcom's hugely successful video game, to be more specific) and usually that's not a very good sign, since all those game-based horror movies have absolutely no story construction and the special effects as well as the set pieces always look far too hectic. ""Resident Evil"" looks good, very good even, and the story is surprisingly endurable, despite being first-class nonsense of course. The film is also very gory and action-packed but the only thing it totally hasn't got are genuine frights. And I heard that rather disappointed the fans of the game (personally, I never played it) because that is generally acclaimed to be really terrifying with disturbing images and unsettling graphics. The movie opens bustling and to-the-point, with employers of the Umbrella Corporation (a company that pretty much took over the world economy at the beginning of the 21st century) getting trapped after the outbreak of a dangerous virus. The large building complex  referred to as ""the Hive""  is located underground and a team of heavily armed commandos, accompanied by two security guards with amnesia, have to invade it for further investigation. Once inside the Hive, the team encounters many unpleasant surprises like zombie-employers, mutant Dobermans, hi-tech anti-burglary measures and a top-secret army project with a gigantic tongue! After the captivating opening, ""Resident Evil"" rapidly turns into a routine horror/action movie with blunt characters and atrocious dialogues. Paul W.S. Anderson borrows many ideas and style-aspects from other genre films, like ""The Matrix"", ""Aliens"" and George A. Romero's trilogy of the Dead. Michelle Rodriguez and Milla Jovovich are tolerable as the tough girls, but they work too hard on their bad-ass-image. Would a smile, if only a little one, have hurt them? The rest of the cast is filled with adequate performers even though they'll most likely never get a star on Hollywood Boulevard. Anderson's directing skills have obviously improved since ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Event Horizon"", as this accomplishment looks a lot more surefooted. ""Resident Evil"" is a very watchable film but I still don't regret having waited patiently to see it until it aired on television. There are a handful of admirable moments (my favorite remains the death-by-laser scene) but overall it remains a boisterous mess.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Game-to-Screen Adaptation EVER.,"When we think about movies that are based on video games, we think of watchable movies like Tomb Raider and Mortal Kombat (and MK Annihilation). We think about good movies (but horrible adaptations) like Final Fantasy. Most of all, we think about the crappiest movies to ever hit the big screen such as Super Mario Bros., Double Dragon, and Street Fighter. This explains why none of us expect Resident Evil to do justice to the game. How wrong we were.The adaptation was incredible. They don't use any of the characters from the game, but the story remains the same, basically. Milla Jovovich, the Fifth Element babe, teams up with the Fast and the Furious' Michelle Rodriguez as they try to escape an underground facility that's infested with zombies. I'm happy to say that the name of the corporation responsible is STILL Umbrella.The zombies were VERY well done, as were the dogs and lickers(?). The acting was also very good. The movie changed a lot of things, but I respect the fact that it kept the video game's story without filming the video game.

One of the best video game movies ever,"I love the first 'Mortal Kombat' film.  It's one of my personal favorites. It just so happens that the film I'd place next to it on my list is 'Resident Evil'... and they're both directed by Paul Anderson!  I'm a huge fan of the video games, I've played them all.  Sure this film takes some liberties (none of the characters are here at all, and there was no Red Queen), but it successfully takes the majority of what made the games so scary and suspenseful and mixes them with some outlandish action scenes. Milla Jovovich (YUM!) is a great female action hero (and flashes some nip to boot!), and tackles the lead of the film rather well.  I've never been a fan of Michelle Rodriguez (she's all pout and no talent), but in the end I was rooting for her and feeling sympathy for her character (she gets the snot pummeled out of her over the course of the film).  There's the familiar villains (Licker, zombies and the dogs), familiar scenes (both from other films and the games) and familiar faces (Eric Mabius from 'The Crow 3' and even Paul Anderson regular Jason Isaacs from 'Event Horizon' and 'Soldier') that make it all the more fun.  The industrial metal music by Marilyn Manson is great, and the FX are for the most part pretty good.  My only major gripe is that while I was expecting this movie to be another 'Tomb Raider' (i.e. complete crap) and it wasn't, I was also looking forward to seeing a good splatter flick.  There is virtually no gore to be found in this film.  Sure there's a head that gets cut off and some nasty looking zombies, but we never see anyone get eaten or ripped apart... that's a staple for a zombie movie.  One particular moment involves the Licker killing someone... it obviously takes a bite out of the person's arm, but when it pulls back there is nothing... no marks, just blood that was there before it leant in for a quick snack.  And upon seeing the victim at a higher viewpoint, we are treated to a gigantic splatter of blood around the carcass, but there are no visible wounds on the person.  Lame!  I hope there is an unrated cut available when this comes out on DVD.  And the end is great, leading directly into a sequel that I hope gets made real soon!  9 out of 10, for all the immense fun and suspense to be found in this surprisingly entertaining survival horror film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the worst video game adaptations .,"I'm writing this review just to comment that I don't agree with all the comments that say that it was one of the best adaptations of a game into a movie .

Anderson (""Mortañl Kombat "" ) doesn't know very much about the game except that the enemies were zombies .First ,the game have a dark and thrilling atmosphere ,while the movie prefers to replace it with a scenery closer to a sci - fi movie,being noisy and pompous about monsters ,like ""Alien "" with some good effects ,but isn't very thrilling .Second ,it have many irrelevant character that just appear to die one by one ,and that 's nothing original .I guess that the movie gives more importance to the visual aspect ( that doesn't have many similarities with the game ) but in general lines it's a empty and irrelevant movie that have too many elements in common with many other movies . But it isn't a accurate adaptation of the game . the good things : the cast was great . Milla Jovovich is perfect as Alice ,the heroine .

"Faced paced action, a bit of gore, beautiful woman.","Ok, there is nothing original about this film, but, as with a number of films being made recently, it can somtimes look original because of the recent love with computer graphics and eye-pleasing cleanliness of of recent movies.Milla looks great and proves herself once again, even if there is little clothing or script available sometimes.  Some might say that she was a little too undressed for the film's rating, (but I reserve opinion as I like to think I'm well balanced enough not to be affected).The action is very cool; violence equally so - although some taken (come on guys, admit it) straight from the excellent, minor cult movie 'Cube'.  My only grudge on the sfx and action is that we could have seen the hologram a bit more.  My only grudge on the storyline is that it was asking me to stretch my disbelief almost that bit too far, which even I can do quite frequently.All in all, I now realise they may have been saving a bit of the budget for the sequel - which I hope lives up to it's future hype.  I must congratulate the script writers, sfx guys and actors for a job well done, considering game-to-movie conversions have not faired so well (see the excellent 'Wing Commander' - yes, I stand by that).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Anagram of Resident Evil: Dire Sent Live.,"A virus has turned the workers at an Umbrella Corporation HQ in to the snarling undead. Enter a crack team of commandos to lay waste wherever possible. But with a super-computer running the show and mistrust and amnesia gripping the surviving humans, it's a mission fraught with peril at every turn.How many good game adaptations to screen can you name? Of course the answer to this will depend on your age, love of the genre-sub-genre, games and how easily pleased you are. That Resident Evil has to date spawned four sequels, suggests that there's a target audience lapping it up. Why? I have no idea, going on this first film it's a wonder all those involved wasn't locked away in some Hive facility of their own to never be let out ever again.Though marginally better than the quite awful Tomb Raider adaptation, Resident Evil lacks atmosphere, shocks and a distinct lack of brain usage for the puzzles in the plot. Add in that it's totally predictable, the characters are dumb and that the creatures are like something Nick Park would make to scare his children, well it's not got much going for it. And that's before we think about dissecting the C grade cast of actors who are as muddled as the plotting is. Then the dialogue, oh dear oh dear, we don't expect Citizen Kane, but come on. Milla Jovovich at least earns her pay as an effective heroine, but under Paul W.S. Anderson's direction she's only really dressed up to please horny teenage boys, with one ""money"" shot thrown in by way of desperation one feels.3/10 for Milla's spunky bravado, Colin Salmon's bemusement at being in such trash and the unnerving AI: Red Queen who out acts all of the cast.",,Anonymous,Horror

A Complete Obscenity,"Completely butchered the original storyline. Directed and written by Paul W.S. Anderson; possibly one of the worst directors of the modern era.Weak cast. No characters of the original idea appear in the film. Instead you get a steady stream of poorly performed cheesy lines and an absurd story line with bits and pieces stolen from the original Resident evil concept. Video games do not survive the video game to cinema transition. This is a painful reminder.I walked out on the scene in which Milla Jonavich did a matrix style ninja kick to defend herself against one of the cerberus's(zombie dogs). They did a good job on those(Props to their prop/make up crew) but used them in a way that just made them look stupid and a shameless rip off from the matrix that doesn't fit into the the original RE story line.Paul Anderson completely butchered the concept of Survival Horror and replaces it with loud death metal and machine guns.

It's supposed to be a horror-flick, does anybody remember Nightmare, Halloween or Friday, if you can find a story in any of those 'classics' let me know.What this movie was is a lust for the eye. It looked so incredibly slick. The set decorating, the make-up, the costumes, the whole visual department did such an incredible job, that even though, the story had no content what so ever, the movie was so easy on the eye, that I didn't want to turn it off, because of this.A lot of people could learn from this.

Noisy and VERY tedious,"Rubbish action.  Rubbish horror.  I was going to limit my review of RESIDENT EVIL to these two pithy phrases.  But when the comment `Well, what were you expecting anyway?' floated in my general direction, I began to bristle at this lazy, time-worn mantra.So what was I expecting, indeed hoping, to get out of this?   More.  Much more.  We simply must learn to be more demanding.  I speak as a fan of the original video games, and as a lover of a good Zombie-fest.  Yes, I love zombies  adore the pasty-faced, shambling hordes of Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD, the eerie moth-eaten Templar Knights from the BLIND DEAD series, even Fulci's faintly charming, crumbling undead.  And here's the thing  the zombies in RESIDENT EVIL are just about the most uninspiringly sanitised bunch you could ever (not) hope to bump into.  They are a distillation of all the film's failings.Early impressions are favourable, with slick visuals and meaty, evocative sound design.  But glossy aesthetics have the capacity to irritate rapidly in the absence of any semblance of plot.  Make no mistake, the screenplay is RESIDENT EVIL'S principal Achilles' heel.  The lousy dialogue (the one element to have survived intact in the transition from game to film) is further undermined by a limp narrative consisting entirely of one poorly conceived and executed set-piece after another.  Characters spend the vast majority of the time running from point A to point B, without thought or ingenuity, to the extent that the viewer is soon faced with a tiresomely uninteresting series of disconnected and repetitive episodes.  Things aren't helped along by some very strange continuity decisions, with characters regularly in calm conversation one moment and the next hysterically slamming doors shut in the face of a mutant horde.As though to paper over the glaring cracks, a bombastic electronic / heavy guitar score kicks in every few seconds, often at the most inopportune moments.  Suspense and fear arise as much from moments of silence as from noise, but the first, most obvious lesson of horror filmmaking is so obviously and sadly lost on Paul Anderson and co.  The undisciplined noise put me very much in mind of TOMB RAIDER, which similarly failed to capture the spirit of the original video games despite superficial similarities in the set design.   These video games are primarily solitary experiences, I would venture almost introspective, whereas the celluloid incarnations are anything but, raucous and over-populated.  I can just imagine a major studio risking a high-profile franchise with an introspective film light on dialogue and supporting characters, but rich in atmosphere.... not.I've seen the word `splatter' bandied about with reckless ease on these pages.  Please don't make me laugh.  The gallery of monsters on offer, including the aforementioned zombies, singularly fail to impress, victims of an overly clean, fussy cinematography that imparts a sanitised sheen on everything.  The blood-letting is unimpressive and deceptively clinical. Rather like persisting with a dull film in the hope of catching the odd crumb of gratuitous nudity, here I was soon hankering after some proper, sleazy gore to alleviate the tedium.  At this point, you know in your heart of hearts that both you and the film are in dire trouble, nay sinking fast.RESIDENT EVIL fails as horror and as action.  It's a one-trick pony that is relentlessly noisy and tedious.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

None of the original characters were in the film, nor did the film resemble much of the game.Even though it wasn't completely based off the game, that doesn't make it a bad movie.

"A horror movie with no scares, and one of the dullest ""action"" movies I've ever endured.","Making movies based on video games is A BAD IDEA. There, I've stated the obvious. Obvious to most of us maybe, but apparently not Hollywood, who despite the fact that there has NEVER been a good one made, have done it yet again. 'Resident Evil' is ""inspired"" by the popular zombie butt-kicking game of the same name. A game I have never played, and after sitting through this tedious, overblown bore, never ever will. Okay, to be fair, I've been told that the movie bears little resemblance to the game. I really couldn't care less. As a movie it stinks. Obviously taking the overrated but still enjoyable 'The Matrix' as its model, 'Resident Evil' totally lacks any of the excitement and freshness of the latter movie. I think you just have to look at Paul ""B.S."" Anderson's CV to work out the reason why. The movie combines action and horror in such a way as to be both frenetic and dull simultaneously, and without any chills or thrills whatsoever. To make a zombie movie with absolutely NO horror in quite an achievement. Milla Jovovich best known for the dreadful sci fi mess 'The Fifth Element' is not someone who I hold a torch for. She has only been in one good movie to date ('Dazed And Confused'), and I can hardly remember who she played in it. She is without doubt a beautiful woman, but I can't think of any other reason to praise her. Milla's sidekick is played by the spunky Michelle Rodriguez who impressed me in her debut 'Girlfight', but who has made lame action movies ever since. Her character here is a walking cliche, a kick ass tough talking Latina seemingly cloned from the one played by Jenette Goldstein in James Cameron's 'Aliens', a movie which is ten times more exciting than this. The only other actor I recognized in the cast was Eric Mabius ('Welcome To The Dollhouse'), but hell, I was battling to stay awake throughout. I nearly gave up after the first twenty minutes, but decided I must at least watch until the supposedly ""classic"" doberman scene, which turned out to a snooze. After that things didn't get any better. If you want to see a genuinely scary zombie movie try some Romero or Fulci classics, or the underrated 'Living Dead At Manchester Morgue', and if you want to see a thrilling and engrossing SF death trap thriller go no further than 'Cube' (or pick up a copy of Algis Budrys' classic 'Rogue Moon'). If you want to play Resident Evil play Resident Evil, just don't bother sitting through this garbage. My Mum always said that watching TV will rot your brain, and if this movie is in your DVD or video playing I say she's hit the nail on the head!",,Anonymous,Horror
"Not a total waste of time, but nothing special either","For a video game conversion, ""Resident Evil"" is quite good. It even stays relatively close to the game for once. Unfortunately, judged as a high-budget movie, it falls short of my expectations, although it's not a total waste either.To it's credit, the movie has some nice-looking special effects and action sequences, and there's even a somewhat successful attempt at creating a storyline with a bit of intrigue (I said ""somewhat"", so don't expect another ""Usual Suspects"" or anything).Unfortunately, this movie once again makes the common mistake of not letting us care about the characters. They're all fairly generic, none of them is introduced properly, and they all look the same. On top of this, most of the action sequences are so incredibly frantic and haphazardly edited that it's really impossible to determine what the *** is going on. As a result, I really lost track of what happened to the character and I didn't really care either. I just a little bored.If you like this kind of movie (""group-of-people-gets-trapped-in-facility-and-must-get-out""), I suggest you go watch the much better Aliens movies (especially Aliens), or even ""Deep Blue Sea"". Those movies have better characterization, more likeable characters, more suspense, and better jokes.*1/2 out of **** stars",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

There were about 60 other people in the theatre at the same time as me, and a goodly majority of them were laughing right along with me at this horrible game to movie translation. The only faintly interesting monster is the Licker towards the end. The zombies look nothing more than extras with poorly applied make-up and that's exactly what they are. I have one question to the makers of this film: Is it so hard to use the already well established and well written plot and story from the Resident Evil games? If it were up to me, I would go the easy route and straight up translate the game to movie form. Apparently CapCom didn't want to let Paul Anderson have the rights to the story as he would so obviously have screwed it up. If you absolutely must see this film, go ahead and waste your $5 to $8. If you want a good zombie story, play the Resident Evil games.Or, if you're dying to see a zombie move, go to your local video store and rent George Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead.

Uninteresting,"I'm no fan of the Resident Evil video games. I have played them but i found them to be quite tedious and slow. Not bad, but nothing that didn't feel like ""Alone in the dark"" hadn't already done it years ago on the Amiga.The research complex called ""The Hive"" is buried deep under ground. Now a virus have gotten loose there that has caused the hive to close itself. A special military unit is going in to investigate.I was of course skeptical when i saw who directed this movie. The Antichrist of b-action Paul W.S. Anderson. And here he does it again, the same thing he almost always does. Turns the movie into crap. And there are several reasons for this.First of all Milla Jovovich is completely wrong in the hero part. Going to war in a mini skirt is ridiculous to begin with, and it just becomes even worse from there. The cinematography is surprisingly OK as are most of the special effects. But the action scenes completely lack any kind of tension or pulse. It's just people firing weapons while REALLY loud heavy metal music is playing, but there is no real excitement. This is typical of Paul W.S. Andersons movies though. The lack of any pulse in the action scenes. Seldom have so many fired bullets and so much fighting felt so incredibly slow.So why watch this? Well it's not recommended. I don't know how it compares with the video games as i don't know the games well enough. But i do know that standing on it's own this is an inferior action movie. There are a few tolerable scenes and a couple of moments that lift this a bit above the lowest mark. But in the end you can do something better with your time. I rate this 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disappointing for fans and non fans alike,"The Resident Evil video game franchise is one of the biggest gaming franchises of all time. It practically started the survival horror genre when the first video game came out in 1996. Of course, it was a big hit and it came out around the time in the 90's that video game movies were being fairly popular. Many scripts were written for the film including the grandfather of the zombie genre, George A. Romero, whose work clearly influenced the Resident Evil games. But in the end, George A. Romero didn't work on the film. The film would be released in 2002, two years after Resident Evil: Code Veronica and three years before Resident Evil 4, and was written, directed, and produced by Paul W. S. Anderson (Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Mortal Kombat, and Event Horizon) and stars Milla Jovovich (Dazed and Confused, The Fifth Element, and Resident Evil: Afterlife), Michelle Rodriguez (Furious 7, Fast & Furious 6, and The Fast and the Furious), Eric Mabius (On the Borderline, Cruel Intentions, and Welcome to the Dollhouse), James Purefoy (Rome, The Following, and Altered Carbon), Martin Crewes (Match Point, DOA: Dead or Alive, and Dream Team), and Colin Salmon (Alien vs. Predator, Mortal Engines, and Punisher: War Zone). The film was a financial success, grossing $102.4 million but received negative reviews upon release from critics whereas audiences where more mixed on the film.Below Raccoon City, a corporation called Umbrella has an underground facility called the Hive which is run by an AI called the Red Queen. When a virus called the T-Virus breaks out, the AI decides to kill everyone as to prevent a breakout on the surface above. Meanwhile, Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up and has amnesia and she is captured by an elite team sent by the Umbrella Corporation to go down to the Hive and figure out what happened.Now, it should be noted that I am a fan of the Resident Evil games, having played a large amount of the games. I knew this film was not going to get everything right, but it seems to get a lot wrong. For people who are outsiders to the video games and such, the film is a subpar zombie film that lacks gore and decent effects and scares and interesting characters to keep people entertained. With that being said, there is enough absurdness to it that could appeal to a certain crowd. The zombies are not particularly scary and a lot of the attempted scares come from fake out scares from anything but zombies. The zombie effects are not too interesting and this film goes and uses CGI effects when practical effects would have been far more effective. Oddly, this film lacks gore which puzzles me when you have a rated R zombie film and you lack gore. The characters are not very engaging and at the end of the day, you could care less about any of the film's characters. Our lead, Alice has amnesia and rather than having her figure out who she is, we are just told by other characters who she is, leaving out any mystery about the character. The elite team is also largely uninteresting save for Michelle Rodriguez who probably is the best actress in this film. Any relationships in the film, like Rodriguez's character and another elite team member, you could care less about. The plot overall is a decent enough idea and what does work in terms of being a Resident Evil movie is that this film does feel like it could easily fit in as a side story in the Resident Evil games. While some may be disappointed that none of the characters in the games make in appearance in the movie, I find it to be a good idea. Because the film already works as a side story so it only makes sense to have original characters. But it would have been nice to see the characters we get, to be made interesting. There are some elements that fans of the games will notice in the film that are present in the games. Locations including the mansion and laboratory are locations used in the first two games. But the depiction of the elite force does not match how the games depicted them. But outside of that, I can't complain, though I am probably overlooking quite a bit but just a general idea should suffice.Resident Evil is not a great film, but considering the reputation of the later Resident Evil films, this film is not really terrible. It is quite watchable and for fans it's a bit of a coin toss. It's not an insult but neither is it a compliment either.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Why can't I shoot open this simple locker with my shotgun? Why don't the people I meet stay with me to increase our odds of survival?) But I knew that RE the movie, being made by Hollywood people, had a pretty good chance of being good, since the premise of the RE movies is better suited for movies than that of other videogames. Hate Hollywood all you want, mock their predictable plot twists and cliched characters, but you haven't been exposed to the horror that is videogame storylines and acting, written by some dorky twenty-something japanese programmer who thinks he did a good job emulating american zombie B-movies, but bless his heart, has failed miserably. Ignorance is bliss, as they say.The storyline is well-presented. Since at the beginning of the movie Milla's character is suffering from temporary memory loss, this gives the movie an excuse to explain to you the how and why's. Basically, it's about a rescue team trying to find out why the computer AI of an underground secret military research facility has gone haywire and killed off everyone. I won't say any more, but trust me, it's good.It grips you from beginning to end because like I said, you're seeing things from Milla's perspective. It does a very good giving you the ""they/we're all gonna die!"" feeling. The action scenes are so-so, it's the ambiance that makes the movie. The haunting soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard, and complements the movie perfectly. Kudos to the composer.The exciting ending does a great job at making you want to know what will happen next. Don't worry, it's not tacked on to make way for a sequel, it actually falls in line with the rest of the movie. I didn't watch RE1 in the theaters because I thought it was gonna suck, but I'll be standing in line at the ticket counter when RE2: Nemesis rolls around.8/10",,Anonymous,Horror
Forgettable,"I've never played the game, but I was interested, so I watched this to see what it's about. It wasn't very memorable. Hopefully the game is better.

Pleasantly Surprised,"I read all the reviews for this movie before I dragged my boyfriend with me to go see this film. After reading the reviews, I got the notion that it was a great film for lovers of the genre, but lacked something to be desired for sci-fi/zombie movie loathers. Well, doesn't that assumption make sense? Anyway, I'm not going to spoil the movie, just suffice it to say, I was pleasantly surprised thinking it was going to be another mindless piece of celluloid. It turned out to be a movie filled with a dreaded atmosphere, and a continuing sense of foreboding, and actual morals. I think my only complaints about the film were the music (yes many other people had reservations about it), and the fact that I wanted to see more at the end, I wanted to know what happened next. Now that can be either a deterrent, or an advantage. Here it's both because there's no real sense of closure, but you actually care enough about the characters to want to know what happens next (rare for a video game-turned film). Oh, and my boyfriend liked it too.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Guilty Pleasure,"This film is extremely bad... among the worst I've ever seen.  But I loved it anyway.  The script was just terrible.  I mean, the plot is extremely flimsy, not one character in the film is worthy of the term, and the whole thing is just a big budget excuse to to make a movie about zombies.  It doesn't have any of the tension of the original video game,   it doesn't have any of the characters of the original game, and, in fact, it bears remarkably little resemblance to the game at all.Some people seem to think it's a prequel to the game.  I don't understand how that works, exactly.  I mean, the end of the movie looks exactly like the beginning of Resident Evil 2 (the game), so it's a prequel to the game's sequel.  I don't know.  But don't think about it.  Just enjoy the cheese.Like that elevator scene in the beginning.  Tremendous.  So bad you can't help but love it.  The whole audience cheered when that happened.  Great.Just to illustrate how little this film cared about it's characters, I'd like to point out that Alice's name is never mentioned on screen until the final credits.  I actually stayed in the theater and waited because I wanted to know her name.  Apparently, she didn't want to know.  Because even after meeting someone she believed knew her, she didn't ask.  Of course, that begs the question why was she suffering amnesia at all?  From a production point of view, it's a convenient (if hackneyed) way to introduce suspense.  Or maybe, since the story was so bad, they wanted to conceal it from the audience for as long as possible.  So, give your protagonist amnesia, and suddenly, none of the characters know what's going on, so the story doesn't present itself to the audience until long after the zombie brain-munching buffet has begun.  But, from a fictional point of view, why would the computer have done that?  Trust me, though, that is absolutely the smallest one of many, many plot inanities.This movie it truly wretched.  Unless you have a soft spot for big-budget b-movies starring talented actors masquerading as vacuous eye-candy, stay far far away.But like I said, I loved it.",,Anonymous,Horror

Very enjoyable,"First off i think that the critics were very harsh on there comments of this film.  Half of these so called critics probably havn't even heard of the 'Resident Evil' franchise and therefore their comments really dont have any effects to my view on the film.Ok, so it wasnt exactly an award winning film but it still had enough ingredients to make me want to see it again, and buy it on DVD.  Milla Jovovich was quite good as Alice though i did find i couldnt really bond to her as the main character to well.  Michelle Rodgriguez on the other hand was very impressive as the hard-ass Rain, her performance was only marred by the harsh fact that she probably is too young to be in an elite special force??? - but apart from that she was great!  Eric Mabius (Matt), Martin Crewes (Kaplan) and Colin Salmon (One) were all good as supporting cast!The films special effects are brilliant and director Paul Anderson uses his imagination well to build a story around the resident evil game.  It's a shame we didn't get to see more of the mansion in which Resident Evil is known and loved for.  The twisted metal music score is excellent to this film and Marilyn Manson must be applauded in the way he handled the high tense scenes within this movie.Resident Evil: Nemesis is in the pipeline for 2003 and hopefully it will have the same pleasing effect as this film did.  It will also be nice to see some familiar looking characters be introduced into the sequal i.e. Albert Wesker!!A great film - 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I was expecting the same brilliant terror I'd come to love in Resident Evil. My hope was crushed as the movie began, flashy special effects, soulless action sequences. It was as if someone had taken the story, and hammered it into a shadow of itself. I expected survival horror, what I got was cheap action with cliché Hollywood shock scenes.This was not the marvel I expected. It lacked atmosphere, and relied heavily upon overly dramatic music suited only to excite a brain dead audience of zombies.

"It's a zombie film, a creature feature, a disaster film, a spy movie, an escape film, a sci-fi evil computer picture, an anti-corporate diatribe, and a disease flick.","It is to writer/director Paul Anderson's credit that he retains the tension throughout. I don't quite understand why this thing received such crappy reviews when it was released five years ago as I found 'Resident Evil' to be real creepy fun entertainment. I am aware that director Paul W. S. Anderson doesn't get a hell of a lot of love out there and is the brunt of many a scornful comment but with RE (that's what those of us in know call it) he has crafted a true zombie horror film that has an eerie ominous feel throughout, some legitimate jump out of your seat moments, plenty of blood and gore for those who like that kind thing and of course Milla is jumping around, scaling walls and kicking much zombie ass.Resident Evil may be empty, but it is still a lot of fun. It avoids being a tired sub-genre film by being so many sub-genres at once. It's a zombie film, a creature feature, a disaster film, a spy movie, an escape film, a sci-fi evil computer picture, an anti-corporate diatribe, and a disease flick. And more than any of those, it's an adventure movie. What's surprising is that they are all done right. The pacing is nearly perfect, keeping things always moving, but never too fast to miss plot points or character development. The music keeps the tension high. The fights are exciting. And I found myself caring about Alice. It doesn't hurt that she's played by Milla Jovovich who looks stunning and moves like a cat. But then, the entire film looks good.

"Nice try, but not as fun as it should have been.","** out of ****Resident Evil is sort of an unbalanced mixture of old-school zombie horror and new-school filmmaking and special effects.  Everything about the movie has to be a lot faster (except the zombies themselves, somewhat surprisingly), there has to be martial arts complete with even some wire-fu, and it has slimy monsters that are rendered by CGI, not old-fashioned animatronics.  As you can see, I was never particularly won over by the film.Resident Evil opens in an underground laboratory called ""The Hive, a top-secret facility owned by a company called the Umbrella Corporation, situated underneath Raccoon City.  One of the lab workers sabotages the place, shutting the power down and unleashing a deadly virus that kills its victims and brings them back as zombies.We then cut to a cutie naked chick (Milla Jovovich) called Alice, who awakens in a bathtub inside some large mansion; not only is she unclothed, she's also suffering from a mild form of amnesia.  Before she can collect her bearings (though she has enough time to put on a dress), an elite military task force barges into the building, taking her and an outsider (Eric Mabius) to the underground facility, directly connected to the mansion.  Their mission is to shut down the Red Queen, the computer controlling the lab, but they''ll have to get through flesh-eating zombies and maniacal defense systems to accomplish that.As directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the same man who crafted the far superior and terrifically frightening Event Horizon, Resident Evil is unfortunately lacking in much of that film's thrills and chills.  Anderson shows an inconsistent hand at staging and filming action sequences; the movie's numerous shootouts and fight scenes are only mildly exciting at best, hampered too often by close-up shots of big guns and expended shells. Worse yet, all the violence is sanitized; there's hardly any blood or gore in this picture.Actually, what's probably most memorable about the picture as a whole is how maddeningly inconsistent it is in terms of pacing and excitement.  For every scene that's fun to watch, there's another that's just plot-stopping, whether it's watching it's watching the survivors move from one bland-looking corridor to another, or Milla Jovovich jump-kicking zombie dogs in slow motion, or a computer program tiresomely going over the very simple zombie rules.There are also some glaring technical faults that I'm surprised were't fixed or edited in post-production, such as an unbearably loud industrial score that blocks out most of the expository dialogue, most of it uttered by Colin Salmon, who if you're familiar with his work, already has a pretty quiet voice that'd be inaudible matched up against anyone else in the cast.The zombies in this movie are your basic ""pale and rotting skin"" undead, some with the occasional missing bits of face and flesh.  Unfortunately, the zombies in this film have goofy-looking mechanical movements, as if though their joints were so stiff, they could barely show much in the way of mobility.  Maybe it's the effects of rigor mortis, but this makes zombies far less enjoyable to observe.Most of the cast ranges from non-descript to just plain awful.  Easily the worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez, whose only distinct trait is a perpetual frown; she's given a lot of macho dialogue, but Jenette Goldstein she is not.  Surprisingly, it's Jovovich who stands out as the film's kickass heorine.  Sure, she's not much of an actress, but she's got the physical stuff down pat, for the most part.  And she's cute enough that I don't mind seeing her in a slinky red dress, as well as a couple of scenes that briefly reveal some of her naughty bits.Because there's hardly any gore, Resident Evil doesn't really work all that well as a zombie flick.  And because it's not scary, horror is out of the question, too.  But being a zombie fan, I'm prone to forgiving movies of this ilk simply because I'm pretty easy to please.  Resident Evil is a passable enough timewaster, worth a rental, but it's certainly nothing I'll ever give much thought to again.Compared to the recent spate of zombie horror, Resident might very well be the most lackluster of the bunch.  It's never as intriguing or intelligent as 28 Days Later or as marvelously thrilling as the Dawn of the Dead remake and it's never as hilariously enjoyable as the misguided House of the Dead, proving that mediocrity really can be less entertaining than plain awfulness.",,Anonymous,Horror
No.,"Created an account just to review.Movie has plenty of action moments, but instead of remaining true to the fantastic story, this movie really strayed into ""Oh wow!

Could have been an amazing series had they actually followed the Resident Evil stories.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
resident evil,what resident evil lacks very much was more action. the reason why i say this is because in every scene it told somethings that we already know.i also felt that the movie should have been longer because of the missing details that they don't feel us in with. Resident evil is a good action flick but it does not have the horror or(edge) that a real horror movie has. take dawn of the dead for instance it brings a mostly good story line and creates suspense and horror.RE picks up at the mansion in raccoon city where everything is a blur to her and her husband.Alice is then trapped underground with a few other soldiers. but i will not tell the whole movie that would ruin it for other RE fans. the first time i saw this was on com cast 5 years ago.I was very satisfied with it to the end. RE still have could have better for all the gamer fans.for Imb fans you should enjoy it but don't expect it to be cream of the crop material.i rate it a 7.5\10.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil,"The nasty Umbrella Corp have a disaster in their 'Hive' facility unleashing genetic viruses, zombies etc. A top team go in to sort things out where they find Milla Jovovich who has lost her memory.Fairly enjoyable, albeit simplistic horror / sci-fi that essentially follows the team on their journey throughout the hive facility with a nasty something lurking behind each door. 5 sequels followed, so obviously this has its fans and for a Kate Friday night viewing it will pass a Merry hour or so otherwise it seems like a low budget actioneer influenced by endless zombie films and Alien.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Does the game franchise justice...,"An all new story beginning before RE1 and ending around the beginning to middle of RE2.  Definitely captures the feel and tension of the game.  The eerie (and fitting) horror soundtrack by Marilyn Manson heightens the tension.  Lots of good moments that make the viewer jump in their seat. You also get to see A LOT of Milla in this.  Lots of tips of the hat to players of the game, you will notice quick shots of similar rooms and cameos of characters from the game.  This film, while light on plot, does make use of it's R rating.  Definitely the best video game to movie conversion ever and the best horror film in several years.  Recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Big Resident Evil fan gives **1/2 stars out of 4,"I been playing Resident Evil games forever now. I own all four games including the original version that came out in 1995. I must say I enjoyed the movie. I was entertained for 2 hrs, but it is clear Paul Anderson intended the movie to be for the younger audience. I liked the fact that the movie stood true to the game's story line with the exception of it's main character's but that did not bother me. What bothered me was the fact that I didn't jump once while watching the film, and not once did I get goosebumps. Horror? play the video games, those scare the hell out of me. This movie had techno and rock music playing in the background while funny looking zombie's are on screen looking to bite people. The zombie's are not scary at all, compared to George Romero's zombies, those were creepy, even John Landis' Zombies in the Micheal Jackson video Thriller looked creepier. Not once do you see the zombies in Resident Evil tearing flesh on rotting corpses. Watch Dawn of the Dead , and you'll see what I mean. I expected to be disturbed by this movie, like the games do to me, but unfortunatly not the case.What's good about the movie is the story, decent acting by the sexy Milla, she's mint, as well as my favorite sexy gangsta chick Michelle Rodriguez. Too bad there's no S.T.A.R.S. members, like Wesker, Barry, Jill or Chris, but the screenplay is very similar to the game. Keys needed to access different parts of the lab, the crows, the lickers, security code's ,and even a sewer scene. All true Resident Evil fan's know a RE game is not an RE game without a Sewer level of some sort. Looks like there will be a sequel, This time the setting will be the street's of Raccoon city, like Resident Evil 3 ""Nemesis"" which is actually part 2 in the game series. I hope it is creepier, and scarier, and bloodier, because if the video game's have mature ratings to keep it away from minors, then the movie which is rated R should not be intended for the young audience as well.",,Anonymous,Horror
Blah,"There hasn't been a commercial zombie movie in quite a while thus I was quite excited to watch this one. So I joyfully trotted to the cinema, paid for my ticket and took a seat. It all started quite nicely with people ruining around and having their heads chopped off by berserker elevators. Then I smiled when Mila Jovovich courteously showed a nipple because you simply can't have a good zombie movie without gratuitous nudity. But the further I got into the film, I mean the movie, the more disappointed I became. This movie is so tame! I wanted to see zombie brains splatter on walls. I wanted to see people being decapitated in graphic detail. I wanted to see Mila shoot a double barreled plasma powered bazooka twice her size at that tongued creature and to make it blow up in tiny little chunks of bloody goo. This is a zombie movie guys, where is all the gore?",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very well done. One of the best video game adaptations.,"Think 1984 meets Dawn of the Dead. There is a big bad company that gets its funding from secret experiments that involve high tech viral research. Almost everyone has this company's regular products at home so it is virtually unstoppable.The mysterious beginning the story shows someone deliberately releasing the virus into the company's main research lab. Out heroine wakes up, equally mysteriously, in a shower in a strange house which is attacked by commandos whose mission it is to enter and disable the research facility's computer.The story is told from an interesting point of view and the revelations as to what happened are pretty cool. The action scenes are well done and soundtrack is awesome. So overall this movie is a surprise since it is both based off of a game AND conceived by Paul Anderson. This is his best film so far. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Given the source material and time it was made...,"Making a movie based on a video game has only lately, when things in the industry are different, proved to be a good move. ""Resident Evil"" tries it's best, but instead of survival horror, we have action movie mixed with horror. Only ""scares"" present in this movie are jumpscares. Milla Jovovich is bland as a main character, Michelle Rodriguez being a far better suited for the role. Action is mostly bad and the best parts come in form of, ironically, hand to hand fighting with zombies (Jovovich). Story has a good idea, but it all falls flat with the atmosphere. It's jut when you watch a movie and you feel like you are not enjoying it, forcing yourself to watch it. Same is with this one. I wouldn't watch it again. As far as video game adaptations go, this one is good for it's time, but now, it isn't very good. Still, if you want to pass some time and are a fan of the games, knock yourself out. 5.5./10 (for a video game adaptation), 6/10 (for an action horror movie).",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A nice addition to the zombie genre,"The first time I saw this film as a rental, it seemed pretty average. After multiple viewings via cable (it seems to be a favorite on HBO), my opinion has gone well up.The film does not necessarily have tons of scares, but plenty of suspense and action. I've always believed that Anderson has done a great job of creating isolation spaces, and this is no different.The acting is also decent, Michelle Rodriguez is not great, but let's face it is great to look at. I like Eric Mabius quite a bit, and Milla is as convincing as one might be with a supermodel kicking ass etc.All in all I'd recommend the film, however the sequel was another matter.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Superbly well done cinematic achievment.RESIDENT EVIL gets a ****/***** stars!,"RESIDENT EVIL, was so much better than I expected. The movie itself was not just a horror, but a thriller/action film as well. Great combination of these traits, as well as great characters, special effects, plot development, and just plain weirdness, make RESIDENT EVIL truly one of the best horror films ever. I own the first Resident Evil game(got it used), and never got real far, because I  got an XBOX around last year when it came out, but now after this movie, I think I might just play the RESIDENT EVIL game more again! The movie really does go along with game nicely. The plot and characters aren't exactly all the same, but the basics are, and it's almost that you'd expect the game came off the MOVIE, instead of vice-versa. If you want a great horror, thriller, or action movie(or all three), rent RESIDENT EVIL-I assure you that you won't be let down. 4/5 stars.NOTE: This movie is pretty gorey, so if you don't like gore, don't get it.

"Overall, pretty good.","Resident Evil was by far one of the best video game adapted movies, especially considering the low budget boundaries. Unlike other zombie horror flicks it doesn't literally ""throw the zombies in your face"", it makes you wait and wonder what will happen. This giving the movie a better element of surprise in the beginning then other zombie flicks. Overall the performances from the actors was good, but at some points could have been better.

Although the ending could have been better, I strongly recommend you seeing this if you are craving action, zombies, and suspense all in one movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not much to do with the game series and as a zombie flick, not bad at all...","Quite an entertaining movie but the fans of the game may find it disappointing as this doesn't necessarily stick to the games. In fact, the things that this movie and the games have in common is the T-Virus, zombies, the monsters and Umbrella, not the story. The story wasn't so well-thought but W.S Anderson's twist on the Resident Evil universe works to an extent. While trying to make the movie his own, it felt like it was driving away from the Resident Evil universe and started being its own movie (which isn't really such a bad thing). The music added the tension and added more 'oomph' to the action scenes which fit the movie quite well. 'Resident Evil' didn't exactly have you waiting for more but at the same time, it didn't make you turn it off. There were two or three scenes that were kind of boring and pointless but other scenes were well-executed.One thing I couldn't really fault was the acting for some of the actors. Milla Jovovich being the star of the movie and Michelle Rodriguez following close-second were brilliant. Their on-screen 'friendship' made it entertaining to watch and also the scenes between Milla Jovovich as Alice and Eric Mabius as Matt was also good. I couldn't say much for the others like Colin Salmon and Martin Crewes who were just average. The special effects and make-up in the movie were done brilliantly and added such a dark and cold tone. The design of the monsters were done well as were the make-up for the zombies.The movie ended quite well and wasn't exactly predictable like some of the scenes in the movie was. The ending wasn't exactly so shocking that you would remember it but for a movie that was above average, it ended well and it felt like it went smoothly with the movie.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
It does not deliver; plain and simple.,"This one should have been ""The Night of the Living Dead"" of the new millenium. Instead, we get a Matrix-like movie with amateurish directing, an incredibly irritating techno soundtrack and a mistalented cast. Ironically, Paul W.S. Anderson was also the director of 1995's ""Mortal Kombat"" ; perhaps the ONLY good videogame turned movie in cinema history. The success of this film was due to the fact that it gave the videogame fans what they wished, that is action and plenty of it. Unfortunately, Anderson probably forgot that ""Resident Evil"" is a horror videogame, NOT an action one. We wanted endless scares, suspense, a creepie environment. We deeply wished to see the dark atmosphere present in the game, but we get nothing of this. All we get is a group of soldiers spending nearly all of the movie wandering through labarotory rooms and shooting bullets which seem never-ending.And speaking of the characters, why does Michelle Rodriguez think she can act? I mean she does nothing other than spending the entire movie looking angry and mad at the camera that she becomes incredibly annoying halfway through. And she seems to play the same annoying character in all her movies; just watch ""The Fast and the Furious"". It was a great pleasure seeing how she ended up at the end, at least we can all hope she will not be in the sequel.It's a real shame that George Romero left the project of directing this movie; I'm sure he would have done a great job. But he had his reasons of not participating; most probably he read the awful script and was discouraged. So why did I give this movie 2 stars? Hmmm, well probably because Milla Jovovich is a real hottie. As a matter of fact, it's thanks to her that I remained to see the movie till the very end. Cause some smart people know that if you're going to make an awful movie, at least bring in the hottie who will make teenagers fall in love and increase the marketing of their product. The same thing can be said to ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"".(2/5 stars.)TRIVIA QUESTION: Try and count the number of microphones that mistakenly pop out at the top of the screen throughout the movie; you'll be surprised. Another vivid proof of a half-hearted attempt to bring a popular videogame franchise to the big screen.",,Anonymous,Horror
A nice deviation from the games,"I'm a fan of the Resident Evil vodkas. Because of that I was really looking forward to the movie. I hear Romero wanted to do something which stuck more faithfully to the plot of the games. That would have been preferable to Andersons film but thats not to say this isn't still enjoyable.The plot revolves around a virus which has the ability to reanimate dead corpses and was used to develop hideous bioweapons. When the virus escapes, the underground complex known as the Hive is sealed and a special team is sent in to investigate.Andersons film is at first nothing like the game. The original took place in a Mansion and there was no character called Alice at all who is the principal character here. However there are enjoyable references to the games such as the Licker creature which appeared in Resident Evil 2 (VG) and stalks the cast throughout the film. There is also a nice reference at the end to the Nemesis program which takes centre stage in the second film and third game.Its not a startlingly original horror film, or a film which takes the baton and refines a formula beyond what existed originally. But for fans of the games it is an interesting and enjoyable film, and that was what was intended more or less.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vastly Overrated,"Being a fan of action, sci fi and even (good) zombie movies I found this movie vastly overrated.  The action is nearly non existant, the sci fi was thin and stretched but the zombies were just ok.  That majority of this movie is movie is cliche after cliche and you almost always know whats going to happen next.  Its pretty obvious who will survive the whole ordeal right from the begining, and who the 'secret bad guy' is amongst the team. There are also some major holes, like there is a point where everybody is surrounded by zombies right when they first get attacked, then the scene changes and some of the team are just running, wow, I guess the zombies just let them by eh?  Or I love the fact that these people come back to the team later on in the movie and yet again, didn't have to deal with the dozens zombies they had to walk through to get back to their team (which you hear hitting the door when thye close it).If you're desperate for a zombie movie, I guess its worth a rental, or maybe you're a huge fan of the Resident Evil games, but otherwise I can't even recomend it for rental... much less the price of a movie ticket.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Zombie flick with brains,"The mere idea of watching a zombie film is enough to give me the creeps, not because they are scary, but because every zombie film I've seen was bad and dumb. But lucky for me that I am not prejudiced and decided, in spite of my knowledge that there were zombies in this film, to watch it anyway. The thing that makes this zombie flick a good one, is that there is not too much emphasis on the zombies. They are there, but not all the time, because there are bigger, meaner and more complicated things to worry about which have been beautifully' engineered with computers and are quite original.Other things that really made me enjoy this film, were the story, the acting and the directing. The story is a pretty complicated one for a zombie film and there are always a few surprises and enough tension to keep the film thrilling and exciting. The fact that the film continues to do that is mainly due to the good acting and the good directing, which we all know if worse enough can screw up a potentially good film. This does not happen here though. Mr.Anderson and his actors have (according to me) succeeded in bringing the first good zombie film onto my TV screen.8 out of 10P.S.

This is not the game!!!,"Just so you know, if you've played the RE game. This movie is not even close to an adaptation of it. The characters were completely different (no Jill, etc.). Almost no zombies, demon dogs, slugs, etc. The acting was crappy and the soundtrack was even worse. I hate to read comments from kids who say the loved the game and rate this movie as ""cool"", ""a great movie"" etc. Kids, if you really love the game at least do some justice to it. The movie had nothing to do with the story. All they did was film a movie whatever the way they wanted it and said to themselves ""let's make some money out of these dumb video game lovers and stick the name of RE in it!"". I have played the games several times and I still get goosebumps when some creature jumps on my character. The scenes on the mansion really are creepy and the soundtrack really complements the atmosphere in the game. Not To mention in RE Nemesis, I freak out every time he comes out saying ""Star!"", I just run as fast as I can out of there. This was supposed to be the way that this movie should've made me feel. Instead, it was just some b-rated zombie movie with almost no zombies in it and some ""actors"" that don't have a clue as to what are they suppose to act in the film. Kids, wake up and come down to Earth when rating movies. Just don't go around saying ""it was so cool!"" kind of thing.

This was what I wanted,"Resident Evil is not the best zombie movie, but the best action based on zombies, the battle between humans and zombies. The movie focuses on this battle as it should be, there are not trashy sub stories or there are not dull characters. There is not a cliché scientist who responsible for all the stuff. By the way, the movie is stylish and well executed that the sequels don't have. Also, the whole film is entertaining. Resident Evil is a consistent movie on all counts, direction, script... The mise-en-scene, especially the set designs, camera angles and atmosphere recall computer games. Besides, the laser scene is very high adrenalin and to me one of the most unforgettable scenes, not only of the movie, but also in action cinema. The first battle between Alice, the team and the zombies are my favorite, also a great demo scene. It is very long and satisfying. The make up effects are not flawless, but very impressive, not like the second and third movies (they were flimsy) There could have been more clash with the zombies, but as said, in terms of action and a Resident Evil adaptation, it is satisfying. The dog scenes are interesting, even if a bit funny (karate against animals?) The other Resident Evil movies copied it by the way, because it is really creative. The train scene is also pretty good. As said, mostly, those kind of movies start well, some of them develop well, too, but at the end, something ruins everything. Thus, Resident Evil is an exception.

A fun popcorn movie...,"There's a difference between a movie and a popcorn movie. A regular movie features decent acting and plot, and usually has some depth behind it. A popcorn movie is just there for the sake of entertainment. There can be good popcorn movies (The Mummy) and there can be bad popcorn movies (Tomb Raider). But, Resident Evil is somewhere in between.Deep underground is secret laboratory called The Hive. The Hive is owned by the Umbrella Corporation, which controls almost 90% of things that the public has in their house. Someone smashes and releases a deadly virus into the air, which gets transported by the air conditioning. In order to stop the virus from getting out, the computer (named The Red Queen) must close off all exits and kill everyone in The Hive, because once you breathe in the virus, or get scratched or bitten by someone who carries it, you are infected. A special military unit is unaware of the virus and assumes that the computer malfunctioned and went homicidal. So they get their team together and head down into The Hive. The team consists of Rain (Michelle Rodriquez), Kaplan (Martin Crewes) and a few other people that have no relevance to the story other than to meet a gruesome demise. This military team takes down Alice (Milla Jovovich), Matt (Eric Mabius), and Spencer Parks (James Purefoy) who will also help to destroy the Red Queen.When they're in The Hive, they find that all of those who died turned into flesh-craving zombies and that the Red Queen was just doing what she had to do. Now the team has to fight their way out. Oh yeah, and they only have one hour to do that in because the door leading out of The Hive will close permanently trapping everyone down there. Plus, there's a giant zombie that looks like a blob running around. Also, there's some Dobermans that look like they were skinned alive.Resident Evil has a very strong first half hour. There's a somewhat brilliant scene where half of the team are trapped in a room with lasers that slice and dice them to bits if they do not get out of the way. The middle of the movie is a jolt-a-minute ride that works only half of the time. Then the ending is downright stupid. The zombies, also, are frightening the first few times they appear, but then the fight scenes that follow all have the same routine.Now, don't get me wrong, Resident Evil is a bad movie, but it's one of those movies that so bad it's good. As a regular movie, it's not worth anyone's time. But as a popcorn movie, it works very well. So, order the large popcorn with extra butter, sit down in the cushy theater seats and check your brain at the door.---------6/10",,Anonymous,Horror

"Disappointed, highly disappointed.","Resident Evil (2002) is a movie that's loosely based on the zombie killing video game series. If you're going to make a movie based upon a video game at least play it before you decide to write and direct a movie based on it. I've seen several Japanese zombie flicks that are not based on the game that are more truer to the original source than this movie. Leave it up to Paul W. Anderson to take a brilliant concept and ruin it by making a movie that is so unlike the game. By itself it's a decent movie. You can take Resident Evil out of the title and it wouldn't make a difference. This movie wasn't that very good to be labeled Resident Evil. The brain dead suits at Capcom made a huge mistake when they let George A. Romero go and hired someone who's never made a zombie flick. Oh well, that's their problem.Back to the movie. How can you make a zombie movie with sparse views of head shots? I don't know but the makers of this movie manage to.

An excellent soundtrack by Marilyn Manson that really suits the environment. The story is definitely interesting and keeps you focused. Flawless acting.One of the few things I find bad about Resident Evil is the excessive amount of zombies towards the end of the movie. IMHO 'Monsters' should come unexpected and in limited amounts to make it more thrilling. The huge mutant monster towards the very end could possibly be left out of changed to give it a bit more credibility.I also find the Red Queen mainframe computer 'laser' protection system somewhat stupid but this is a minor defect.A similar scenery and feeling can be found in the game Half-Life, so if you enjoyed playing that you will probably like this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The problem with this movie is that the monsters are so badly acted and so awful looking it takes away from any tension because you are laughing at them. Such is the problem with most post-Dawn of the Dead films, the people playing zombies over act and destroy the mood. Chalk it up to awful direction, or non direction of the crowds of zombies.If you can get past the laughter this is a good film. Many people I've told about the laughable monsters, liked the film when they saw it themselves, I on the other hand can't be as forgiving because I loved the opening that much.Try it, but expect to laugh more than you scream.5 out of 10 (purely because of the zombie, the rest is pretty good)",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is a modern classic! Very fun movie with some creepy scenes that you wont forget! (American A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10,"Exactly the right movie at exactly the right time. The music and atmosphere, the sets and costume design, the special effects, the cast. Everything lined up perfectly for a young shaggy. That kid was a gothy nerd with love for video-games, horror, industrial music and Mila Jovovich. This movie managed to check all the boxes. Watching it now, it still pretty much holds up. Maybe a little cheesy but stylish and entertaining. Three stars for watchability, one for nostalgia.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic! Totally rips...,"B-movie cheese, A-movie atmosphere, great characters, tight pacing, nice bursts of action, beautiful production design, a literal killer building w/ twisted traps & dang laser corridor? Yes plz.Mansion, lab, commandos, conspiracy, high angles, big monster on a train fight? ✅ It's so weird in retrospect that people hated this for not being a 1-to-1 adaptation of the early games when this really does a great job adapting said vibes?It's an adaptation, it's in the word, you have to *adapt* things for a different medium- and if you just copy/paste the source material there's nothing new, fresh or exciting.But alas, the most annoying Resident Evil fans will never be happy until there's mystery jewels inserted into the eyes of a secret tiger statue and *2* different types of crank puzzles accurately portrayed on film.Sequels aside, this film as a standalone is really something special, and looking back it's a kind of lightning in a bottle that they never quite recaptured.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Certainly not in the Top 20 classics,"What I liked about this movie was that it was a big mystery that caused the zombies to form. Eventually they figured it out. This movie was based on a computer game. It was a great transition between gaming and cinema. I thought there wasn't enough action in this movie. It seemed pretty boring at first but it turned out to be an OK movie. Some of the special effects were a little cheesy. You could tell it wasn't real. If a monster appears and doesn't look real, it won't scare you as much as a monster that seems lifelike.Resident Evil wasn't as good as I thought it was. But it was still an OK movie. I would certainly not put it in my Top 20 favourite movies. I'm looking forward to a sequel if there is going to be one.I rate this movie 7.5 out of 10",,Anonymous,Horror
survival comedy,"As to view Resident Evil as an movie would be overstatement, because in the end the movie is just a filmed game session. Not brilliant, but not so terrible crap either.I laughed in several places where I probably should have been terrified or scared, so i actually can't recommend this one if you are looking for real horror, but if you can tolerate cheesy plot and bad acting and want some laughs, this is for you then. There is just a bit too much unintentional comedy in the film, the whole seriousness of the tone just adds in that factor.Not one of the best movies of Milla Jovovich",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Shoot-em-up smash at the movies!!,"Ultimately I had no expectations of this movie. Although the advertisements did catch my attention and I was a huge fan of the original game...I didn't expect greatness or failure from the movie. Originally when they talked George Romero or Sam Raimi as director and the possibility of stars such as Kiefer Sutherland or Bruce Willis starring I will admit I did form some sort of image as to what I thought Resident Evil should. This movie did not come close to what I had in my head...but it didn't matter...I still consider it amazing. The action was top notch and the music was pounding and excellent. It was futuristic (moreso than one would imagine) and the whole story comes together in such a way that you are left very, very satisfied. The characters and actors are excellent and you are definitely left disappointed to see any one of them killed. I would like to have seen more of them survive. Milla Jovovich comes through in a big way as the kick-butt heroine who gets some great dialogue. This movie felt like X-Men in the way that it left you wanting more and it felt like it was only the beginning. I thought the ending to Resident Evil was phenomenal and perfect and I couldn't have wished for a better ending. I hope that Hollywood carries on the grand tradition of milking sequels because I would keep coming back for as many instalments of Resident Evil as they can churn out.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ghosts of Mars gone underground.,"I wonder why no-one compares Resident Evil with Ghosts of Mars. Both feature masses of monsters (zombies in RE, possessed settlers in GoM), lack of story, practically same type of film end and a female protagonist (Milla Jovovich in RE, Natasha Henstridge in GoM). Even that armored train from GoM shows up in RE again.Differences are that GoM does not take itself as seriously as RE does. There's just *a bit* more story in RE. I think RE's setting also looks a bit better.Dislikes: Computer game-like transitions in RE (""Party is on level x, entering red queen chamber""). Unnecessary shock effects of that annoying ""Buh!"" type.However, RE is much fun if you like gore - and have some beer with you :-).",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thank you!,"This film is exactly what I needed. A very hot chick kickin' zombie ass. What could anyone else ask for? The gore level is sub-par for your average zombie flick, but this is made up for by the fact that there is an actual plot. The plot unfolds itself perfectly. The lead in to it's sequel will make fans of the game happy. I could have used some more zombie action and gore. The zombies looked great when they did hit the screen. I'll be patiently awaiting the sequel. It's not a perfect film, but it sure did put a smile on my face. This film is very grim and dark from the start. Much like the game it captures the tone of ""survival horror"". The dark atmosphere of this film is rare in today's horror films. Take this one for what it's worth and enjoy the ride. I give it 8 stars out of 10.",,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't even meet the low expectations set out for it,"This movie was disappointing by any standard. With immediately forgettable characters (who you couldn't care less about whether or not they live or die) laughable, garish special effects, and extremely unfrightening zombie things as the primary terror delivery systems, ""Resident Evil"" doesn't have enough action, scares, or anything else for that matter to satisfy anyone. Not horror junkies, not video game fans, not even teenage boys looking for a lowbrow 90 minute diversion.  It's even more glaringly bad when you consider that its left itself open for a sequel... *sigh* Well as long as people keep pouring millions and millions of dollars into crud, unoriginal movies, Hollywood'll keep pumping them out.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

I give it a 2 out of 10!,"I went into this movie expecting a decent adaptation of the game series, but instead I got Matrix ripoff crap.It's not that the atmosphere wasn't there, my main problems with the film had to do with the main character played by Milla Jovovich. First off, they make a big point to show that the zombies can take quite a few bullets without any effect, yet when Milla kicks a zombie in the chest, it's dead. Uh huh. Yeah,okay. Then she kills another one by hitting it in the back with a paperweight later on. When cornered by the dogs, she manages to hit a bunch of moving targets with expert accuracy, then kicks a dog who was jumping while her back is turned, killing it instantly. How'd she know the dog was jumping? Then there's a damn bullet-time moment towards the end, I swear the Matrix ruined action films forever with that s***.After seeing the film, I can only assume that Resident Evil takes place in The Matrix and Milla Jovovich is actually The One.Then there's the whole thing that bothered me in the beginning of the film. The soldiers are strapped to the gills with explosives and automatic weapons, yet they are unaware of the fact that there are zombies and creatures in the lab. They think they're just there to shut down a computer.Why the hell would you need HK's to shut down a frickin computer?Resident Evil would probably be a decent film if I was about 10 years old and had never played the games. The hand to hand combat aspect was totally out of place, I know I wouldn't touch an infectious zombie if I were in the same situation, I think I'd rather run like hell.It is the best video game adaptation to date though, so I had to give it at least a 2 for effort. Paul Anderson, please leave video games and classic films alone. If you must continue to make s***** movies, at least ruin something original and don't bring down the quality of what's already been made well.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT ROCKS!,"I don't know who rocks hardest, Anderson or Rodriguez. Anderson is my favorite director and with R.E. he shows (again) how to make a game into a movie. With a simple story he manages to make the best game-to-movie ever, and probably the best zombie film ever. Michelle Rodriguez is cooler then any action-heroine around, with her cool rough style.  She also moves cool in the movie, in one scene she reminds me of a cat. Yeah, sure, Milla is also cool as action heroine (harder then in 5th Element) but the star of the movie is Michelle, whitout doubt. The introduction is really cool, and the fact that you just *know* that there are zombis lurking, before the commando team does is also great, you just wait for them to pop out. This movie is better then I expected, but Anderson is a genius. And Michelle rocks.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"same old computer stuff's, yada yada.","I seen the movie, It's ok.Let's face it. Some of us might liked the movie and Some of us think it's gross or other of us think it great.

But sometime the producer's want to use the special computer to make us swe for their so-called ( great work ) but spend to much money on it.Special Effect was been using in ALOT ALOT ALOT of movie's and we seen most of it now-a-days. now tell me this, How come we never seen one simple movie that has no computer special effect to show us ?why ?    It's simple.People loved the special effects in the movie's. It make them more future people than in the morden day world. The production or producer's want the people believed that this is their fanstay and they can either save the world or get kill.

"Dead Zombies, Dead Movie","Somebody mailed a BM (Bowel Movement) into Hollywood and they made a film about it. This movie based on the popular video game was a horror to watch leading me on a number of occasions to look for a gun or any kind of weapon so I could put an end to my misery. Fortunately for me, there was nothing but stale soda and greasy popcorn. Just when I thought this movie was going to end, it started back up again, did this about 3 different times. The best part of the movie was when the credits were rolling. That and the sexy Mila Jovovich who we do get to see naked  yes guys thats right, naked!

This is the kind of movie that will give you the ""Expect the unexpected"" vibe as the story progress, there's also a new type of monsters that evolved from zombies that gives a surprise impact which entertains me more.

"Milla Jovovich good, movie bad.","Wow, this film was bad.  I mean, the best part was watching Milla Jovovich!! She looked good and hid her accent well.  This performance on her part was fine and she shows good moves (way better than that pile of dribble called TOMB RAIDER).  The movie starts off ok with a cool shot of where the scientists work in ""the hive"".  Then something goes wrong and the computer locks down the lab and kills everybody.  Then, a SWAT team shows up lead by some man who looks like the CANDYMAN.  There's a scene where some laser beams slice some of that team.  That was a rip off from the Cell.  Then suddenly all these makeshift Zombies show up after five hours of being dead! It was Alien's meets Return of the Living Dead (especially since The Candyman is in it) with a little bit of OUTBREAK thrown in.  What you get when you mix those three together is a movie that appeals to only little kids with candy.  In fact, I was embarassed because I was the only adult in the movie theater!  I wanted to see that hispanic girl DIE the entire time. I also wanted for Milla Jovovich to have more speaking parts.  Milla Jovovich is one of the best actresses of our generation.  I hope that Milla Jovovich learns that she can do more than just these sell out movies.  Ugg. And what's the deal with that stupid Red Queen?  As if any artificial intelligence (another stupid movie) could be all nice and then start screaming ""KILL HER!  KILL HER NOW!""  Many things were wrong with this movie.

"A really well made,acted and a fantastic story","I really like this movie because it is well written, well directed and Paul Anderson chose great actors to portray the the commandos. Michelle Rodriguez, Milla Jovovich, Colin Salmon are definitely the better out of all the other actors. The zombies are not put in your face at the beginning and there is a cause for the infection unlike the night of the living dead movies and also unlike the night of the living dead movies the zombies are less like the stereotypical zombie. The story is easy to get into. Although most of it is not based on the games as far as i'm concerned this was a great movie. Paul Anderson is a genius for writing and directing this movie. Acting 8/10. Story 9.5/10. Directing 10/10. This movie is still scary and it is most definitely better than its sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely awful - but had to be seen!,"As a *very* big fan of the games I had to see this.I knew it would be tripe, and it was. The acting was dreadful, the action wasn't particularly exciting and the zombies looked unintentionally hilarious. In places it was boring too, with a distinct lack of chemistry between any actors and poor 'one liners'. They went for a serious movie and came up with a joke. Romero's screenplay got him sacked and they came up with this instead?As for the actual linkage between the games and the movie, well it was sparse. There were definitely similarities in places, but not particularly good ones. None of the characters from the games are here which is a huge gamble.Overall, if you're a fan of the games, see this because you'll want to - but be warned that it's terrible.A number of 'patrons' actually left half way through. I was tempted to do the same but thought better of it.On a side note, the certification in UK gave this a 15? What does it take to get a an 18?",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining thrill ride,"This film, based on the popular video game, has a group of soldiers battling zombies in some kind of futuristic science lab underground.. the layout of the place was never really clear to me. However, the film is very entertaining even as it plays up the cliches of the zombie genre.  Milla Jovovich comes off well as an amnesiac who joins the soldiers as they fight the zombies, and she turns out to be a formidible fighter, even though she spends most of the film semi-naked... but hey.. works for me... The film is an entertaining thrill ride that plays like a live action video game but if you go in expecting that, you get what you wanted. GRADE: B",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finally!!!,"Not since the realease of Alien many many years ago has there been a horror flick that gave me the ""Oh s**t"" reflex. I was not expecting much since movies of this genre have been so dissapointing to me in the past.  The video game to movie scene has not had much success for me...ie Mortal Kombat. There has been many failed attempts at horror films in the past, but I have to say that not a one has made me yell at the television screen....""Oh you had better run faster than that!"" in a long time.  I wish I had seen this one in the theatres, DVD on a small screen did not do it justice. This was not your typical Jason or Michael slashing at anything that moved. It actually had a story line that kept my interest and attention.  The story made sense, I could see this happening in some day in age with all of the genetic research going on.  Am I paranoid? Nope, not yet....the movie was good but not that good. Rent it, see it, you will love it.  Just be careful what you are grabbing when that ""Oh s**t"" reflex kicks in.  You will understand grasshopper when you see the movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
Sad for a game fan,"I don't know where or how to begin because it's really tough for me, as a game fan, to describe what I felt when I saw this movie for the first time.First of all, I played Resident Evil for so many times that I can't count. All first 3 episodes are one of my favorite games and my favorite kind of genre.The introduction of the first game is quite exciting, showing us all the cinematic importance of the game with a man stepping into a corridor, being attacked by something unknown and the name ""RESIDENTE EVIL"" appearing in the screen in red blood. Then, the game opening shows how everything started. Of course the actors were a lot like amateurs but it was innovative and frightening for a game those disturbing scenes till the game finally starts into a hall in an anywhere mansion. The main characters of the game were Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Albert Wesker, Barry Burton and Rebecca Chambers. This brief description of the game is just to make clear how the movie starts as a completely mess.I think that, to say something about this movie, we have to say if from 2 different point of views: as a game player and as a non game player.As a game player I couldn't understand why they have changed all the original plot of the game. None of the original characters was there and all the interesting facts of the game have been totally ignored. All of the original game characters had different and well defined personalities and each one of them have its importance during the game story, something that do not happen in the movie for the fact that Alice is the main character and everything surrounds her. The cinematic importance of the game has been completely forgotten in the movie and all the frightening atmosphere of the game was totally lost. For a first impression, I liked the fact of Milla Jovovich as the main character just for the fact that she's not a box office name but she's an action star and a name needed for the movie's success, but she is an awful actress. Her face is always the same from the beginning to the end in each movie she's cast, with no exception. But what I keep asking myself is: ""Why Alice as the main character? Why all that stuffs about a girl suffering from amnesia, The Red Queen and The Hive, when we already had an interesting plot from the original game?"".The game plot involve a group of special agents that are lost into somewhere full of all kind of monsters that, in fact, are zombies from a genetic experience accident by a part of the Umbrella Co. that's hidden under a mansion for its illegal studies content. This is also an interesting plot for an action movie because it's simple, original, understandable and full of action (that's what action movies is all about). And why did they had to make something so complex in the worst way? But the worst thing is that they did something so strangely complex that's almost impossible to insert the original characters during the movie or in its sequels. So, as a game player this is an awful adaptation.As a non game player I could find the movie quite funny. The movie starts well giving a detailed explanation about the happenings over the Umbrella Co. until the virus takes control of everything. The zombies are interesting because jumps over your eyes that all zombies are people not dressed well with dirty make up. That thing about Milla recovering from an amnesia all, discovering her fighting techniques under pressure situations are so def that is hugely laughable. It's laughable because it's a common situation in the history of action movies and very few of them made it quite well as The Bourne Trilogy. It's also laughable because it's not in a movie called Resident Evil that that situation would be taken seriously from the writers and the audience. Milla Jovovich, as said before, is one of the worst famous actress of history and I can't understand why people like her so much as she isn't an actress because she's never acting. She's always looking with the same way, she's always with her mouth half-open when she's amazed, frighten, happy, sad... and she's always shaking her jaw when she has something quite important to say as: ""you'll die!"" I liked some scenes that I don't remember by now because they were too short. Lot of people hated the final scene, claiming that it was a scene for a predictable sequel, but I liked it a lot and I think that it's the kind of impressive scene I was waiting for during entire movie and it's the first time when you can finally realize the complete chaos and destruction that Umbrella Corporation caused and how it should be if something like that happened in real life. So, as a non game player I had an enjoyable time watching that movie but it could be a lot better.That's sad. The movie suffers from improvement failures over the potentials of the game, and the game (and also the fans) suffers under this awful adaptation.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Entertainment,"A film that can be watched many times and that makes it more successful than many films.The casting is excellent. A fun mix of action and horror makes this movie extremely entertaining and interesting. The casting is good, especially Milla Jovovich, who is a great choice for the role of Alice.This movie tries to give the viewer good entertainment and it succeeds. Fun action scenes and tension with a simple formula: a good main character, brutal scenes of violence, a bit of horror and an interesting story.We follow Alice through her monster-filled adventure in an underground facility that she must pass through in order to survive and discover the truth. Today's screenwriters usually ruin such a fun story and burden the viewer with unnecessary things, but luckily this is not such a movie.The main character is not unbearable, arrogant and above all disgusting, on the contrary, the main character Alice is completely opposite to the characters we are used to seeing nowadays, this is a character who is sympathetic, funny and likeable. This is not one of those characters that makes you want to stop watching the movie, quite the opposite.

Conventional zombie film,There isn't much to distinguish Resident Evil from any other zombie films; the same concept of how to kill the zombies or how the people became zombies. The concept of a group of survivors being killed off is also very conventional. The only fairly original part was the mutating hunter that at the start looked like a giant vicious rabbit (I'm not sure if that was a deliberate reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail). The only good thing that can be said about this film was that Milla Jovovich was quite convincing as an amnesiac.Overall it is just like almost every other zombie film ever made although it is watchable at times.4/10,4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great movie.,"I have seen a lot of movies in my time, but this one kicked their butts! It got my number 1! In about 2005 I went to a friends place for her Birthday. We all sat down and started watching some movies. This was the only one that we could agree on. I was entranced through out the entire movie. The story, the characters, the mythology, it was captivating.A beautiful woman in a red dress, suffering from amnesia and being surrounded by anyones worst nightmares is enough to get the movie going. The progression was fantastic. Things never turned out the way you would expect.After I saw the movie, I hired it a few times from Video Easy. After about 3-4 hires I couldn't do it anymore. I needed to buy it. I bought it on VHS, but I was disappointed at the quality. I watched it another ten times. I then hired the DVD a few more times. During that time, I hired, watched (46 times) and bought Resident Evil: Extinction. We went to Thailand for a holiday, and I bought a copy the number 1. It was a pirate. Disappointedly, I came home and bought it again.After watching it a few dozen times, and researching Resident Evil on the net a few times I was ecstatic that there was a third coming out. I counted down the days for the next 9 months and got a group of 10 people and got them to join me in seeing it at the cinemas. We all loved it. I heard nothing bad from anyone. My blood felt strange, and I was in awe for the next week. I am just waiting now to buy it.If I could, I would send my money directly to them.I have watched the original about 30 times now, Apocalypse about 46 times, and Extinction 7 times. I bought the original Resident Evil on 3 different formats. If that doesn't say how good this movie is, I don't know what does.A really well done movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Throwback Action-Horror,"Video game movies have been awful for decades now. Resident Evil isn't necessarily the exception to that rule, but it's nowhere near as awful as the genre has been.Resident Evil is at its best when it pushes aside the politics of this ""secret military group"" named The Umbrella, and instead is an homage to the original Alien. When the film takes twists and turns that are supposed to surprise you, when in fact, they feel like a weak attempt at shock, it becomes overwhelmingly convoluted. But in the instances that the survivors, led by Alice (Milla Jovovich), are scrambling through rooms doing anything to survive CGI creatures and flesh eating zombies, Resident Evil is pure guilty pleasure.Much like the Underworld franchise, I honestly don't care about any of the supporting characters. Knowing where most zombie flicks go, there's really no use to getting attached to secondary characters when you know their deaths are all but guaranteed. I did, however, find Alice to be compelling, as long as the sequels do more to expand her history and explain how she became an absolute bada**. In fact, one can make the argument that Alice is a more likable character than Selene is in Underworld.As I've said a lot recently, there's nothing wrong with a mindless action adventure if it doesn't take itself too seriously. Resident Evil is actually a pretty serious film, people are dying left and right, and the world is on the brink of an apocalypse. But there's something to be said about a throwback action-horror taking place in one confined space. In this case, it gives the viewer a sense of what a first person shooter game with this story would feel like. I've never played any of the games, but I can certainly see where this story lends itself to the video game medium. Now, is there an excuse for a horrendous looking creature via CGI? Or maybe some truly useless characters with weak (at best) dialogue? No, I can't say there is. But hey, it's a solid cable watch.+Action that doesn't pull punches+Alice is likable-Dated CGI-Inexcusably bad dialogue5.8/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
My favorite zombie movie!,"Breath in.....breath out....breath in. Hi everyone, I am here to talk about the best zombie movie ever: Resident Evil. I first viewed the film when I was six and then I didn't understand English good. When I was about nine or ten, I viewed it again and it was then that I realized that Resident Evil is a masterpiece. It has guns and blood and horror all the way through and, boy, is it one heck of a awesome ride. The lady in red, Alice(Milla Jovovich), has to be one of the most important characters of all time. I mean without her the movie would seem crap and boring but she made it look good. The story is nothing short of brilliant because it will have you captivated and immersed into a world of zombies that like to bite! When 28 days later came out along with its favorable reviews, I though that it was going to be better than Resident Evil but after watching it, 28 days later came out to be nowhere near as good as Resident evil. I love this movie and all the sequels and I can't wait for the new one called RE: Afterlife.After waking up, Alice, has no memory of her object due to the exposure of nerve gas. Along the way she joins a squad whose mission is to contain a virus released by the Red Queen, a supercomputer in charge of the release of the T-Virus. They have to fight through zombies and the Red Queens fatal traps in order to complete their mission.The acting is wonderful from Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and many more. They know how to use their expressions and body language in the movie. The gore and horror is so stupendous it was one of the reasons this became one of my favorites. From biting people on the body to deadly traps, this movie has it all. The sequels were impressive but could not match the power of RE1. All the horror and zombie fans will have a good time enjoying a zombie movie that comes out every four or three years. Ciao, ladies and gentlemen! ****/****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Will they ever learn?,"I cannot understand why film makers take a source material that they think will make a good film, then take out everything that made it good in the first place. For the uninitiated, the original RE video game was a smash hit because it featured, for the most part, a lone character in a genuinely spooky mansion never knowing what unspeakable horror was round the next corner; it also had creepily atmospheric music and unfortunate voice acting. Sadly, the only element that has been retained for the film version is the last.Writer-director Anderson must take the blame, and one can only assume that a) he never actually saw the game; and b) he is so out of touch that he thinks if you like video games and horror, you must be a young, male, heavy metal fan. This mess begins and ends with lame attempts to have a not particularly talented supermodel appear on screen wearing as few clothes as possible. In between is the aforementioned metal cacophony, bad acting and uninspiring special effects. The tension that brought the game to life is completely lacking; the action is rarely involving; and the (very) occasional shock is not enough to compensate for the unintentional hilarity of Jovovich, clad in a fashion disaster, turning into an acrobat and wrenching zombie necks with her thighs.The scariest thing about it is that the sequel, as far as I know, is already in production - but if you avoid the bargain bins at your local rental outlet, you may be lucky and miss it altogether.",,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent premise....,"...for a video game! I joined IMDb for the sole purpose of writing a review for this movie. I don't even care if anyone reads it, I just absolutely had to vent. I watched this movie with average expectations, knowing and having heard little about the film. Let me be the first to say that this movie should never, ever have been made. And then they should never, ever have made a sequel (but that's a story for another day). I won't give anything away here, because there's pretty much nothing to say about the movie that hasn't already been covered in the summary... in a way that makes way more sense, I promise. Meanwhile, this movie is just like the video game. Literally. I felt like I was playing a first-person shooter the whole time. The kind with a lot of unnecessary segues and animation, but no real action. But without the fun of doing it myself. (More accurately, I guess I felt like I was watching someone else play a first-person shooter.) The concept of the plot itself is just really, really dumb. Usually you can make up for something like that with good action or awesome fight scenes. Not so here. The action felt forced and was extremely predictable. Loud sound effects and a soundtrack with lots of power chords never make up for a lack of substance, and didn't here. Milla Jovovich's talent is completely wasted in this film. She's too good to be doing stuff like this. Really. And regarding Michelle Rodriguez... well, I've seen better acting skills in my 14-year-old sister's school plays. She has only two facial expressions: angry, and really angry. I only gave this movie a 3 out of 10 because I've seen The Hulk.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Different and very cool...,"Rewritten on: 10.9.06Let's get one thing straight. This film is not a horror-movie. Horror-movies are lame. Resident Evil is anything but lame.Almost everything about this movie is excellent. The atmosphere kicks ass and the movie has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. The over-all feeling is rather abstract, but not so much that it would make the film difficult to follow.This film is also not a Zombie-movie in the traditional sense, but more like an action-thriller...with zombies. As far as movie-monsters go the Licker was a great piece of work, even if in the earlier scenes it was a little dumpy-looking. The only other notable point that I may criticize is that up to the halfway point of the film it perhaps attempted too many times to startle the viewers which seemed a little goofy.As a final note, the ending crawl is one of the best I've seen in any film to date. Even if the film's plot (which I felt was on par with the games) is nowhere near as good as in Silent Hill, this is still my personal favorite on the front of video-game films.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Games are better,"I enjoy the resident evil games but first time watching the first movie and it was any typical early 2000's action movie. Obviously watching these 20 year old movies in higher definition takes away the quality of early special effects but in this in particular movie, the effects were laughable.Hopefully any future movies will hit hard like last of us series has. Michelle Rodriguez suits the movie well and hasn't aged a bit in her current movies such as the many fast and furious movies.

No One Is Immune with Live-Action Resident Evil 2002 Film,"I like sci-fi, action, and horror, and the 2002 film ""Resident Evil"" has given those to me.

When will the zombies first appear? Who may get killed first? The jump scares are well done.I like how Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez do kickass moves. The atmosphere set in the underground lab is creepy. The music is also scarily very good.The action sequence is amazing. And the plot twists are shocking.

Resident evil,"funnily enough, my interested faded once the zombies arrived. The opening was chaotic, bringing you into the film immediately and the introduction of Alice up too the zombies was interesting. The vibe which the hive generated - a feel of imminent doom inside chrome walls, set up the rest of the film well. Now, it suffered in the character sector. The most important necessity in a horror is a strong group of characters; even more so than the frights themselves. Alice herself is weak and unlikable while the armed forces sent to investigate the hive also lack any charismatic flair. Take Michelle Rodriguez's character for example. Her chronic crumpled face syndrome did nothing but cheer me on for her to die.Resident evil might of been the film to bring the zombies craze to the 21st century, but after watching similar celluloid's such as 'The walking dead' I can only feel obliged to hate on the style in which is used to create a sense of rapid danger for the hordes of zombies. The jagged, blurred style of motion used does nothing but weakens the suspense. I feel that they've failed at creating any fear towards the zombies. Add the awful characters and we're left with the action which is frankly dull. They might as well be shooting at...Well,a bag of bones in all fairness , as the lack of appeal & emotion involvement with the guys down in the hive leaves me wishing that they take there shooting down to the target range.There are some good moments to be watched: the lasers and the dogs. And The opening 45 minutes lived up to it's billing. However, for a horror/action film, Resident evil is tame.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Masterpiece!!!,"I love Milla very much. I like this movie, since this is one of the best she ever starred in, including the Fifth Element or any other. But Resident Evil is ever fresh, ever thrilling monster. The plot is excellent and from the very start the movie holds you glued to the seat and never allows you even to take a breath in or out. Milla as Alice is brave, sexy, valiant, courageous, smart, cool and so clever. And then there is Michelle Rodriguez as Rain, she is so gloomy, so dark and so demonic, that you hardly avoid falling in love with her too. The very idea that some large corporation like Umbrella here may control you, create some terrible genetic monsters and never be responsible for that is also a big magnet in this film. This is cool, impeccable and great All 10 / 10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Bad script, bad screenplay, bad acting.","Resident Evil was not a good movie.I watched this movie not being a fan of the game, but a huge fan of zombie-killing movies in general.  I was expecting more from Resdient Evil than the other videogame movies.  Although Resident Evil was better than said movies, that's not saying much.  Since it was an 18a movie, I was expecting some gruesome scenes.  Instead, I was presented with some cheesy laser cutting action, which unrealisticaly seemed to go right through the guys, leaving no identifiable burns.  It would have been a lot nicer to see some sizzles and cracks, or maybe to see that dudes intestines fall out as he jumped up.  But unfortunatley, the movie quickly moves away from any images of real gore.  To me, this was pretty bad, considering this was supposed to be a zombie killing movie.The movie also had some confusing parts.  Twice the main character, played by Milla Jovovich (which may have been the only really good part of this movie) was surrounded by zombies and it seems there is no hope, when suddenly she appears climbing up a ladder away from them, or closing a door on them.The zombies themselves were not that great either.  The movie totally abandoned the style that I can even respect in the game.  There were no axes, knives, chainsaws, flamethrowers, or other such weapons of violence. Instead the victims used guns to create small little holes in the zombies that did nothing.  The makeup of the zombies wasn't anything out of the ordinary either.Some people have said that the story matters more in Resident Evil.  Um, but the story isn't that great either.  Just another cliched example of the all powerful evil bioweaponry cooporation.  And if I wanted a story, I'd read a book.Resident Evil is the perfect example of how someone can mix a beautiful woman, zombie killing action, a creepy mood, and a heavy metal soundtrack and somehow manage to corrupt and detract from each element to create a 5/10 star movie at best.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Save your money,"A major disappointment to say the least. All a video game movie needs to fulfill it's limited purpose is cool monsters and some good action sequences. So what made them think they could get away with Night of the Living Dead? This crap was okay in 1965 when it was done the first time and not so bad with the various George Romero remakes and sequels but all this is is a bigger budget B flick. Utterly predictable and full of ""startle scare"" scenes. This is the other side of 13 Ghosts but with a plausible(for the genre)idea and lousy monsters - ""more brains!"".

horrible,"Personally I thought the movie was terrible. A complete disgrace to the game. It should have at least followed the game. I mean, here I am waiting for  the plot from Resident Evil to begin and the movie has already moved on into what takes place in the second game. None of the characters had their own personalities and suddenly the people who couldn't remember a thing know everything. Not to mention that fact that they all magically have fighting skills and have flashbacks that leave the audience in confusion. It's as if you missed the begining of a great movie. Maybe some background info could have helped. I have played the game before and I was very dissapointed. The special effects could have been better (some of the monsters almost looked like very detailed cartoons). The only credit I can really give is to the Zombies who were portrayed very well. The movie could have been better, if the crew knew what they were doing. They should have assumed that not everyone in the audience would be fans of the game. They could have made a great movie and used it to sell the game. Hopefully the second installment will be better.",,Anonymous,Horror
Way Over Rated,"This film starts good.  It leaves you wondering until it all starts to make sense.  Unfortunately most of the most interesting characters get killed too early.  There is some suspense and some strong music.  Many parts of the film are more gut wrenching than suspenseful.  This movie is mostly grim and depressing especially in the last half. You walk out feeling kind of down and a little sick.  Even Milla is a little over rated.  She is not that pretty with a weird nose.  She has very little personality either.  And all the graphic cuts and bruises are a real turnoff.She is no comparison to Angelina Jolie, the Mummy star, or even the excellent lead actress in Ghosts of Mars.  I should say the other brunette female lead in the film who was also in Fast and Furious and Girl Fighter is very good with a powerful personality.  But the ""I want to kiss you bit.."" line is stupid.  I much preferred John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars. But you need to like Carpenter to like that film.

Not A Good Adaptation But A Fun Movie,"Resident Evil follows a team of commando's investigating an underground biolab after a reported incident occurs inside of it.The incident is more severe then any of them suspected as the former employees are dead but they are still walking around and they are hungry.Seeing as Resident Evil was originally a groundbreaking horror game you'd think this film adaptation would be a mirror image of it however this movie only has elements of the game in it spread out through various visual effects, lighting, and set design everything else is completely different.Director Paul WS Anderson (Mortal Kombat,AVP) intended this movie to be a prequel to the game and show how and why the viral infection escaped however many did not know this and immediately hated it because the storyline and characters in the movie were never in the game.The elements of this movie are a mixed bag.The acting is very good especially Milla Jovovich, Eric Mabius, and James Purefoy but Michelle Rodriguez gives her one trick pony tough girl act again.The script is at times suspenseful and at times god awful mostly coming from poor dialogue and badly delivered one liners.Visually the film is gritty and very grainy with a very cold colour temperature which creates suspense but looks at times boring and unappealing.The music in the movie is also mixed sometimes it's absolutely perfect others it's loud and overbearing however the main score is an absolute masterpiece thank you Marilyn Manson.The action is raw and hardcore, the gun brawls are great but the hand to hand is weak and cheesy especially when it's Milla vs the zombie dogs.The special effects are pretty good but at times far too unrealistic and far too fake looking for example some of the gore and CGI effects(the licker is obviously CGI).This is probably Paul WS Andersons best film it's not perfect, it's not brutal but gamers probably won't like it too much.The film is mildly entertaining but the lack of special effects and good hand to hand choreography you generally see in an Anderson film (Mortal Kombat,Soldier) are missing in the otherwise fun film.The trailer isn't misleading if you've seen it you know what you're getting into n action/horror that isn't supposed to be taken too seriously.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best Video game to movie translations...,"After the whole George Romero fiasco I was torn...The early buzz on the film made it look as if the film wasn't very faithful to the game which was odd considering that Romero was let go because reportedly his script was not faithfull to the game...Why was this odd?

Paul Anderson makes a better job when he has more control,"Although Resident Evil struggles to label itself a decent film, there is no doubt that it reflects everything it needs to so it can compete amongst the Hollywood mainstream. Paul Anderson is certainly not the best director around, however, at least he reflects the game series for what it is. people constantly moan that the film doesn't do the game series justice, well why not? it has the same stereotypical characters, the same environments, and the same action. the only people that bother to see it are the people that sit and play every game. Don't worry I'm one of them, but try and favour Anderson's adaption of game's horror devices into movie ones. it can't be easy, because we don't get to control the characters, however, he makes sure of some 'nifty' mainstream editing and some mindless action. people should just  admit that this is the stuff they want to watch.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Just because the zombies are slow, doesn't mean the movie should be.","I'll admit that I'm a closet fan of the series, but the first installment doesn't do as much for me as the later movies. My main complaint is that the best part of the franchise, Milla Jovovich (Alice), doesn't get going until the last quarter of the movie.Until then, we're subjected to boring build-up and the lamest, slowest zombies since the first Resident Evil game. When Alice finally starts doing her thing, the action picks up, but that doesn't fully wash away the boredom of watching the generic other characters being killed far too slowly.There isn't much cross-over between the movie and the game, besides a few of the locations and the zombies. I don't mind that so much, but I wish Anderson would have added a few more cool moments and set-pieces to Resident Evil, to balance out the boredom. He clearly didn't aim to make the movie scary, so it really needed to be action-packed, to keep the viewer's interest.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Resident Evil Director's Cut was just as good. 9.7 out of 10. Then I got a Playstation 2. Then I got Resident Evil Code:Veronica X. 9.8 out of 10. I never played Resident Evil Dead Aim. Then shortly after that I saw the Resident Evil movie. It wasn't the best movie I ever saw, but I still liked it. The only thing I hated about this movie was that they wanted to make boys to see this movie was because a hot looking girl was wearing a red tube top and a mini skirt. That not's what Resident Evil is about. It's about the horror, the action, the monsters, maybe hot looking girls, but not wearing mini skirts when she has no idea what is going on. Millia.

Dissapointed,"I have been a big fan of the video game in which this film is inspired so I was very excited as I entered the film room to watch the movie. And after around one hundred minutes of action (and little more) I went home very dissapointed for several reasons.First of all, I don´t think this is a complete movie. I had the sensation that what I have just seen it was like a chapter of any T.V. serie. This film doesn´t have a complete plot or even a finish, it only puts the things in order for Resident Evil 2, something that in my opinion it´s disgusting.Also, there is an abuse of action scenes that completely dominate the movie. The action scenes are pretty good, but I would hope to see something more of the cerebral element (as it was sometimes in the video game, especially the first version).Finally, even the 'big bad boss' you are supposed to watch at the end of the film it´s pathetic. But of course this is connected with Resident Evil 2, when finally a really monster -Matt Adison converted in Nemesis- will come into the scene (again, this movie is only a chapter or a presentation of things to come).So, I only would recommend this film in case you are the purest fan of the action movies and have never take care of the video game.

This movie is entertaining only in the same sense that Plan 9 From Outer Space is entertaining.  The attempts at both horror and scifi were quite humorous at times.Completely unabsorbing.  Occasionally I would be stirred to interest with some development here or there, but it was all too brief.  Milla-wise, the beginning has a flash of nipple.

Constantin Films made a grave error in their advertising campaign by changing the name of their film from Resident Evil:Ground Zero to Resident Evil.

Complaints have been made that none of the games characters are in the movie but in actuality they shouldn't be if it's to be kept true to form.

A movie based on a video game... Uh oh!,"I am a big fan of the Resident Evil video games. Heck, I bought a GameCube just so I could play them, but this movie is such a disappointment. First of all, the movie is so chock full of stupidity in the beginning that I was unable to re-engage my sense of goodwill. First of all (and I'll start with the positives) the sets are excellent. The zombies are excellent. The zombie dogs are great (anyone who played the video game will appreciate them, I think) and Mila Jovovich gives a solid performance as ""Alice"". (On the other hand, after seeing the film about five times, I can't remember her ever being called Alice and the last time I saw it I watched it just to see if anyone called her that. They didn't. If I'm wrong let me know.) Also British actor James Purefoy is good as Spence even though he wasn't given a great deal to do (if you want to see an even better horror movie check him out in the Brit horror film ""Lighthouse"".Now, on to the stupidity. We're told the Hive has only one emergency exit/entrance. Basically that means there are only two ways in and out. Who would agree to live and work there? Hasn't anyone ever heard of ""cabin fever""? Sure they have the screen by the windows that shows regular traffic as if they were above Raccoon City, but that isn't the same. Who would willingly ""live and work"" miles underground in such conditions? On top of that, we're told that the security system/computer the Red Queen went homicidal four hours earlier by the security team. Wait a minute, the security system went homicidal FOUR HOURS EARLIER and security is only just showing up? That's not a very impressive response time. On top of that, we're shown that the biohazard leak is the work of a saboteur, yet for some reason the Red Queen (despite having security cameras set up literally everywhere) doesn't know who it is (because if she did, it would have been a completely different movie). On top of that the false scares are telegraphed and most of the opportunities to genuinely scare the audience are missed (there are a few that are done well, but since these are the highlights of the film I wouldn't dare spoil them). Though on the other hand, the CGI for the ""licker"" is less than impressive (hasn't anyone seen the ""Gollum"" in LOTR? Note to budding horror/sci-fi directors: watch those films and learn!). On the whole, this film would be best for horror film fans and fans of the video game. If, however, you're interested in the DVD because of the extras, don't bother. Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez dominate the commentary track with giggling and other inanities drowning out the director just as he's about to tell what seems like an interesting anecdote. On the whole, a zombie movie that's been done before and after and done much better. (How about 28 Days Later?).",,Anonymous,Horror
"cool, slick, action packed and scary","Resident Evil is one of the biggest if not the biggest video game franchise ever and rightly so. The games are intelligent, action packed and scary as hell. Taking the first game and sort of making a prequel/sequel to it with this film Paul W.S. Anderson of the 1995's visual spectacle Mortal Kombat executes the right formula with his adaptation. By setting it in a sort of alternate universe he manages to keep an heir of unpredictability. We open the film with a viral attack on a huge underground laboratory owned by the Umbrella Corporation. Soon after that we meet Alice the films lead heroine who is suffering from memory loss played by Milla Jovovich with a exceptionally physical cool factor. A studly mystery man named Matt played by hunky Eric Mabius and soon after a security team featuring a very young and quite annoying Michelle Rodriguez. They of course go into the hive where they encounter many biological and digital terors such as an evil computer program, mutant creatures and loads and loads of zombies. What make this film work so well is the way it's paced it feels like a video game and you feel like your playing. As the film opens into its later segments and you learn more about the main character and the storyline you seem to be one upping levels it's an intriguing experience and a brilliant approach. Sure there's a little goofiness afoot and some of the FX are unimpressive especially by the standards now as well as being slightly repetitive at times. But Resident Evil is the best adaptation of a game it's cool, slick, action packed and scary!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Takes the fun out of movie watching,"This is a throwback to the movies of the late sixties and seventies, which were meant to take the fun out of movie watching. It reverts to the old Nazi standard of Hollywood in which any woman with dark hair and any man with fair hair must die, and the Nazi ideal of the blonde woman and brunette male live. The movie bends over backwards in its Nazi idealism, and it wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so trite and predictable. We get this 99 time out of a hundred, and it is dull, and it just isn't fun for anyone who isn't a Nazi. Can't say much about the plot. There is none. Can't say much about the acting. There is none. Can't say much about the characters. They are one dimensional cardboard stereotypes. Can't say anything good about the writing or directing. Total bomb. And depressing, too.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
I have loved zombie movies ever sense,"I thought it was AWESOME! Its kinda one of those movies where you either have to hate it or love it. I loved it. Michelle Rodriguez (Rain Ocampo) was awesome. Milla Jovovich (Alice) I think really did a good job...they even did almost all of there stunts! Some of the Goofs posted, you wouldn't know about unless you watched the commentary (I did of course). A lot of the things are really unnoticeable. The handwriting continuity was pretty bad though but I didn't realize it until the second time I watched the movie. I didn't watch the commentary until the 3rd time I rented it so I didn't know about the floor flexing in the elevator scene until I watched the commentary...I really liked how the director didn't shove the zombies in your face until like half-way through the movie. One of the reasons I really liked the movie was BECAUSE they didn't find out how to kill the undead until the Red-Queen chamber scene. I didn't enjoy the second one (Resident Evil: Apocalypse) BECAUSE they already knew how to kill them and it wasn't as much of the learning curve as in the first one. I really enjoyed this movie and I plan to get it for X-mas... Yes I loved it that much!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An awful movie that disrespects the Resident Evil franchise,"As a huge fan of the Resident Evil videogames, I gotta say the W.S. Anderson movies are trash tier and a poor representation of the franchise.Poorly written dialogues, nonsensical plot and set design,unlistenable soundtrack, wooden acting and Milla Jovovich's Alice being a complete Mary Sue really bring this movie down. Even if there are some positives like some of the characteristic monsters from the original RE trilogy being represented (mostly) accurately, the negatives far outweight them. This movie is unwatchable for me.If you are craving for some good Resident Evil movies, go watch the Sony produced CGI ones. They not only are canon to the games but they also are a much better representation of the franchise, are animated really well and have much better acting and soundtrack than the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
