This film was compelling and had emotional weight.,"The Woman in Gold is based on the true story about a woman, Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren), and her lawyer, Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds), as they attempt to reclaim ownership of an extremely valuable painting (along with a few more) form the Austrian government nearly fifty years after it was stolen by the Nazis. This film has three distinct parts that intertwine through the duration of the show. First, there is a family dynamic that focuses on the emotional stress of the current situation on everyone's personal lives. There is a strong connection between Randol and Maria that grows over time and is given time to grow in these segments. Second, there are flashbacks that dive deeper into Maria's past and emphasize the importance of the artwork as well as explore parallels between the past and the present. Finally there is the trial itself, which is where the action of the conflict lies. This is the least important, yet still necessary part of the story. The percentage of time given to these segments would be around 40/40/20, respectively. While you might be surprised how much of the story takes place in the past, it really does drive the plot. There are many white-knuckle scenes and heart wrenching moments that really add to the film. The past is just as important as the present in this movie, and that is exactly what the film is trying to say. Helen Mirren, as always, was amazing in this film. She was subtle and drove many of the scenes that required raw emotion. Ryan Reynolds was also very good and his role in this film might have been his best performance (from what I have seen). Actually, all of the actors did a fantastic job here. Everyone was on there A-Game and gave it everything they had. There was great chemistry between Mirren and Reynolds which made their characters' connection even more compelling. Reynolds was able to subtly change his character as the case slowly changed his motivations. While, yes, there are a few clichéd scenes that were put in there for emotional levity and drama, but they don't really take much away, if anything. This was an excellent film and I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The real woman in gold,"Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds star in ""Woman in Gold"" from 2015, a true story about the quest of Maria Altmann to recover art stolen from her family by the Nazis in Vienna, the seat of anti-Semitism in Europe.I just want to point out, to answer some of the reviews, that this is not a documentary, it's a movie. Movies combine events, change them around, omit them. No one wants to watch a tedious film that recognizes that it took a huge amount of time to get to the Supreme Court. If you want the actual, factual story of Maria Altmann's journey, you will need to read about it or see one of several documentaries. Films are meant to pique our interest.Altmann speaks with a young attorney, Randy Shoenberg, about recovering The Woman in Gold, a painting by Klimt that is considered a symbol of Vienna. Klimt in fact painted a series of stunning portraits of Altmann's aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer, who died of meningitis at the age of 44.In her will, she asked her husband Ferdinand, who had seen the writing on the wall in Vienna and fled to Prague, to donate the paintings to the Austrian State Gallery.Although he has just started a new job, Shoenberg travels to Vienna to see the will. Along the way there are flashbacks of Vienna in the '30s, where the Bloch-Bauer family lived in opulence. When the Nazis came to their home, they stripped the place of everything valuable - and there was a lot -- and put the family under house arrest.Maria and her husband, an opera singer, manage to escape in a harrowing scene. In flashbacks, Maria is played by the remarkable Tatiana Maslany, the star of ""Orphan Black,"" who looks incredibly like a brunette Mirren.This is a touching, beautifully told story of one man's sacrifice and determination and a woman facing up to her past in order to seek justice.Helen Mirren is one of my favorite actresses - here, she is a vibrant, energetic octogenarian who finds the struggle for the painting uncomfortable - several times, meeting a roadblock, she is ready to wash her hands of it, but Schoenberg won't let her. It represents her family to her, and some uncomfortable memories. You can see all of that in Mirren's multilayered performance.Reynolds is excellent as a young man who believes in taking a chance - - he started and failed in his own law practice - and in this case, going for the gold, despite the fact that he has a wife (Katie Holmes), a baby, and one on the way, and an intolerant boss. It doesn't faze him and when Maria wants to quit, he is furious.I disagree that there was no connection between them. In fact, there is a deep one. The quest for the painting comes to represent to him what it means to MariaI highly recommend this film. There are tons of movies about the horrors perpetrated on Jews by the Nazis. The recovery of stolen art is one part of that horror. ""You see a painting,"" she tells a group. ""I see my aunt.""",8.0,Anonymous,History
Compelling History,"'Woman in Gold' makes for a dazzling movie experience (even if at times it may leave you questioning it's authenticity). Having not been an admirer of Mirren's early screen work - she seems to have become better with age (well, for me anyway), I was taken with her portrayal of Maria Altman from start to finish (as also in 'The Queen'). Ryan Reynolds gives good support as the young Lawyer taking on a case above his station. Reynolds, whose style is somewhat reminiscent of a young Kevin Costner, plays the Randol Schoenberg part with conviction.London born director Simon Curtis gives the proceedings an easy to watch style and with the help of documentary editor Peter Lambert, they keep the viewer engaged throughout. Curtis also gets to direct his American wife (in a guest style role) Elizabeth McGovern, who has since made England her home. First time feature screenplay writer Alexi Kaye Campbell has fashioned an interesting interpretation of the writings of Altman and Schoeenberg's own life experiences, looking back at yet another of humanity's all time low past atrocities - although as mentioned, for some, certain sections of the screenplay may not always ring true (?)Cinematographer Ross Emery (Matrix) gets a chance to prove he's also good without the help of tons of big budget CGI. It's hard to tell who did what with the music score, credited to both Martin Phipps and Hans Zimmer but, it's pleasing in an unobtrusive manor. Design Guru's, Andrew Ackland-Snow and brothers Dominic and Giles Masters (Harry Potter) with the help of others, ensure it looks good - perhaps while also getting a chance to strut their stuff without being drenched in CGI.As a minor point, some location settings in Austria seemed a little too devoid of people to give an accurate representation, still, it's an amazing human story, both informative and entertaining. It should please most sophisticated audiences, while letting us reflect on an episode from our dark past.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Blending art, history, justice, and identity","Greetings again from the darkness. The responsibility of the filmmaker when the project is ""based on a true story"" is elevated when the story has significant historical relevance and blends such elements as art, identity, justice and international law. Add to those the quest of a remarkable woman whose family was ripped apart by Nazi insurgents, and more than a history lesson, it becomes a poignant personal story.Helen Mirren portrays Maria Altmann, the woman who emigrated to the United States by fleeing her Austrian homeland during World War II, and leaving behind her beloved family and all possessions. After the death of her sister, Ms. Altmann becomes aware of the family artwork stolen by the Nazi's during the invasion. This is not just any artwork, but multiple pieces from famed Austrian artist Gustav Klimt  including ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer"". See, Adele was Maria's aunt, and the stunning piece (with gold leaf accents) has become ""the Mona Lisa of Austria"", while hanging for decades in the state gallery.The story revolves around Maria's partnering with family friend and upstart attorney Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) to take on the nation of Austria and reclaim the (extremely valuable) artwork that was seized illegally so many years ago. They are aided in their mission by an Austrian journalist (played by Daniel Bruhl) who is fighting his own demons. The seven-plus year legal saga is condensed for the big screen and we follow Maria and Randol as they meet with the Austrian art reclamation committee, a federal judge (played by the director's wife Elizabeth McGovern), the U.S. Supreme Court (Jonathan Pryce as Chief Justice), and finally a mediation committee back in Austria. But this is not really a courtroom drama  it's a personal quest for justice and search for identity. What role does family roots and history play in determining who we are today? It's the age old question of past vs. present, only this is seen through the eyes of a woman who has survived what most of us can only imagine.Director Simon Curtis (My Week with Marilyn) uses startling flashbacks (with Tatiana Maslany as the younger Maria) to provide glimpses of Maria's childhood through her marriage and subsequent escape. We get to know her family, including some scenes featuring Aunt Adele (Antje Traue), and Maria's father and uncle (Henry Goodman, Allan Corduner). We understand this family's place in society and just how dramatically they were impacted by the Nazi takeover.Helen Mirren delivers yet another exceptional performance and manages to pull off the snappy lines without an ounce of schmaltz, while also capturing the emotional turmoil Ms. Altmann endures. Director Curtis and writer Alexi Kaye Campbell round off some of the rough edges and inject enough humor to prevent this from being the gut-wrenching process it probably was in real life. This approach makes the film, the story and the characters more relatable for most movie goers  and it's quite an enjoyable look at a fascinating woman and a pretty remarkable underdog story.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A great film that fell through the cracks,"My original perception was that this was an indie flick that only played in the art houses because it was an artsy film. the truth is that it's a great film that simply didn't get the luck of the draw when it came with mass distribution. Woman in Gold would be at home with any of the Oscar nominees and contenders and would easily be considered more of an outright crowd pleaser than a film like Danish Girl (which got nominated in acting categories) or Brooklyn (which did make the final cut for Oscar).The film is based on an eight-year-long quest by a California-based lawyer of Austrian descent and a longtime family friend from the motherland (the prior relationship between the characters is erased in the adaptation process) to reclaim confiscated art by the Nazis.The film's main strength is that it's neither a holocaust story nor is it a standard courtroom drama, but it's a fresh new take on both genres. As for the former, the film feels fresh through its specificity to the Austrian experience and the specificity of a wealthy family. The film is more relatable to the experience of anyone descended of an immigrant who had to leave the old regime. As for the latter, the film's main challenge wasn't showing a guy having his flashy day in court but rather a long slog as it was taking a toll on his life. The film handles this challenge in pacing admirably.More than that, the film flies on the strength of its central relationship. You never think of Ryan Reynolds (best known for subversive leading men or a smug action stars) and Helen Mirren as occupying the same universe but the chemistry between the two goes a long way towards making this film transformative.The film is a powerful one about remembrance and loss. It teaches that one can't fix the past, but healing those wounds is a noble cause.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A beautiful,serene movie with outstanding acting by Helen Mirren.","""Mrs. Altmann, it would seem that if your case goes forward, world diplomacy will collapse, and you will be solely responsible.""""Woman in Gold"" is a wonderful and sometimes touching film. Not because of the topic as this was already highlighted in ""The Monuments Men"", but because of the brilliant rendition Helen Mirren is showing here. A role that suits her perfectly. A distinguished elderly lady who's a descendant of a wealthy Jewish family and who was forced to flee to the United States during Austria's annexation with Germany. She left behind everything: family, personal things and valuable belongings that were owned by the family Altmann. The resentment towards the German ruler obviously is still as lively now as it was in the past. And despite her intention never to set foot on Austrian soil again, she still makes the overseas trip to reclaim the famous painting ""Portrait of Adèle Bloch-Bauer"" by Gustav Klimt, since she's the rightful heir. That this invaluable piece of art was worth a fortune, is swept aside by her as irrelevant. In the end the painting has been sold to a renowned New York art gallery for a mere 135 million dollars. I'm sure at that moment it wasn't irrelevant anymore.The film is actually twofold. Obviously there's a less successful part and an exciting second part. The first part, and least successful, is about the court case Maria Altmann starts against the Austrian state, who consider the previous mentioned painting as a national treasure. The fact that it was stolen by the Nazis and actually ended up in their hands unlawfully, was a side issue apparently. So the first thing we are presented with, is an old fashioned courtroom drama with Ryan Reynolds as the young lawyer Randol Schönberg, grandson of the famous Austrian composer Arnold Schönberg and also descendant of a family of war refugees.The fascinating and interesting part of the film focuses on the past and present of the widow Altmann. A metered mixture of images of this zestful character these days and the painful memories weighing on her shoulders. These memories are displayed in old-fashioned-looking sepia-colored flashbacks. A sketch full of contrasts of the still traumatized Maria and the conditions in which she lived during the occupation. The humiliations and fear. When she gets back in Vienna after so many years, Mary's facial expression proves that this past still weighs heavily on her.Helen Mirren is a kind of mixture of P. L. Travers and Queen Elizabeth. A lady behaving according to the etiquette from the upper middle class who keeps certain values and norms still alive. A stiff Victorian granny who suffers from a trauma and is seeking for justice. A kind of Miss Marple, but then still in possession of an elegant well-preserved beauty. Without any effort Mirren surpasses the young Reynold on screen. Despite his immense importance in the complex legal procedure, the character pales in comparison with the engaging, witty and sometimes tragic person performed by Mirren. Despite the fact that now and then she brings forward corny sounding quotes, she remains a credible and worthy character.Of course you can cite that the Austrian people are portrayed in a one-sided and caricatural way and look like an anti-Semitic nation that supports the Nazi-regime. Personally, I'm convinced that it's pretty close to being true and that it's more an instinctual survival tactic than that they were supporting that ideology. But that's another discussion. Maybe the relationship between Maria Altmann and her aunt Adèle could have been worked out a bit deeper. But the acting of Mirren and the tragic images of the past create an unparalleled film filled with tragedy and justice.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",7.0,Anonymous,History
Maslany and Mirren shine,"I thought that this was a very entertaining and informative film, which sets the scene naturally.It was not overly dramatised or forced and with excellent performances; particularly from Helen Mirren and Tatiana Maslany who played the same character at different ages perfectly in harmony with each other; showing how history can change people from youthful optimism to pragmatism and a wistfulness for a glorious past.History buffs will find it a fascinating foray into the glory of Vienna's past. Though art stolen by Nazis is a theme recently explored by movies such as The Monuments Men, this part of the Second World War has not been really explored by the movie industry; I am sure there are more stories to come. There have been a few movies about Austria and the Third Reich, the Sound of Music springs to mind. This one compares favourably with both the aforementioned films.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Another golden performance by Helen Mirren,"The lady in question is Adele Bloch-Bauer who was the subject of a magnificent painting, deploying lots of gold, by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt. Following the Anschuss of 1938 when Germany took over Austria, this painting was one of many, many artefacts seized by the Nazis from Jewish families in occupied Europe.The film tells the story - a little fictionalised - of Adele's niece Maria Altmann who escaped from Vienna to live in California and, during the 1980s as an octogenarian, pursued an audacious claim to take back this painting and other Klimt works from the Austrian Government. Helen Mirren is brilliant as Altmann in another distinguished performance in a sparkling career during which she has played everything from ""The Queen"" to an assassin (RED""), while Ryan Reynolds is surprisingly good as her lawyer Randy Schoenberg in a role a million miles from ""Green Lantern"" or ""Deadpool"".There's a lot going on in this film: legal battles over the art work with some classic courtroom scenes, flashbacks (in sepia colours) to Altmann's earlier life in 1930s Vienna, and an evolving relationship between the irascible Altmann and the idealistic Schoenberg, both descendants of famous Austrians. This is not the kind of film that was ever going to be a major box office draw but it is certainly worth a home viewing.",,Anonymous,History
Better than expected,"It was a good choice after I have read all the positive critics here. This is a very emotional true story that is well told and never boring. There were good flashbacks where all the reconstructed scenes were originally and perfectly done. I felt to be in the movie. All the actors and especially Ryan Reynolds delivered a great job. Helen Mirren put as usual a special humor note into the ambiance. It seems this role is suited to her and nobody else. The music was wonderful and I had even some tears. This movie is much more better than the other ones about the stolen Jewish paintings from the Nazi. See it. 7/10If you like this genre of movie don't miss The Pianist, Der Letzte Zug or Die Fälscher.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Well done and entertaining on a serious subject,"just saw WOMAN IN GOLD and i must be of an entirely different demographic than some other reviewers, but i enjoyed it mightily. The audience obviously did also, as there was laughter and applause at various spots. The acting is wonderful and the story quite straightforward but done with both heart and a sense of humor. there is excellent use of flashback and lovely shots of Vienna. Angelenos will get a kick out of some of the recognizable LA landmarks. I have no idea of what the requested ten lines means, whether it is sentences or actual lines. It's a lovely movie. Not sophisticated but informative, entertaining and thought provoking with excellent acting from both the principals and supporting actors.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds on an art crusade.,"A WWII true story drama that deserves to be told on the screen. Helen Mirren gives yet another astounding performance and I was pleasantly surprised by Ryan Reynolds. What would attract audiences to WOMAN IN GOLD is its David Vs. Goliath story, everybody loves a story about an underdog taking on the impossible and that's what WOMAN IN GOLD essentially is.Directed by Simon Curtis who gave us ""My Week With Marilyn"" four years ago, Helen Mirren plays an elderly Jewish woman named Maria Altmann who sixty years after she fled Vienna, Austria to escape the Nazis, starts her uphill legal battles to retrieve a valuable painting that was seized by the Nazis, a painting that is now in the possession of a museum in Austria. A young lawyer, Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) helps Maria in her quest that receives resistance from the Austrian establishment. All the while her quest forces Maria to finally confront her past WWII provides a ton of stories for cinemas to depict, they will never run out of WWII materials, this one tackles the fact that thousands of artwork and paintings, that were stolen by Nazis, to this day, have never been restored to their rightful owners. Maria's story is just one of the thousands, and I think it's fascinating that WOMAN IN GOLD basically says that yes, sometimes we need to leave the past where it belongs, the past, but when the past committed a great deal of injustice on us, one can't just easily dismiss it and simply use 'the past' as an excuse to not pursue justice. It's obvious too from Helen Mirren's performance, Helen understands that Maria carries a certain guilt all these years, guilt that she blames herself for abandoning her family and abandoning their possessions. Mirren is excellent at presenting us this tortured conflicted soul, caught between being haunted by the past and the desperate need to forget and move on. And Ryan Reynolds holds his ground as the young persistent lawyer. I think people don't give Ryan enough credit because he's a heartthrob, but the man can pass as a struggling family man with strong conviction. I think WOMAN IN GOLD is an important film, unfortunately I doubt that it would be remembered during award season mainly because we're still fresh from another Weinstein Company's drama, ""Philomena"" a couple of years ago which also showed an elderly woman accompanied by a young lad, both on a crusade for the truth.Read more at Ramascreen.Com",7.0,Anonymous,History
"""Woman in Gold"" is a work of art in its own right.","When I review a movie, I ask myself but one question: How entertaining is it? Of course, such a thing is always a matter of opinion and depends on an individual's personal background, personality, tastes, preferences, interests, experiences, and so forth. As a reviewer who likes all kinds of movies and hopes these reviews will be helpful to all kinds of moviegoers, I'm as objective and open-minded as I can be. Regardless of its genre, its subject matter or its background, all I expect from a movie is to enjoy it. This attitude allows me the freedom to like movies of any and all kinds, regardless of whether others think that I'm ""supposed"" to like them or not. Did the movie's comedy make me laugh, did its a drama draw me in and make me care, did its thrilling moments thrill me? Etc., etc. You get the point. I expect a film to entertain me – to make me FEEL something. But the best movies also inform, educate, enlighten and uplift. Oh, and bonus points for originality, creativity, and technical and artistic excellence. When you have the pleasure of seeing a film with all of those characteristics, it is a ""must see"". It is a treasure. It is art. ""Woman in Gold"" (PG-13, 1:49) is such a film.""Woman in Gold"" is based on the true story of Maria Altmann, who, as a young woman (played by Tatiana Maslany of ""Orphan Black"" fame) fled her beloved Austria as the Nazi noose was tightening around the necks of her Jewish countrymen. Encouraged by her family and with her new husband by her side, she left behind the people, places and possessions she loved. One of those possessions was a Gustav Klimt painting of her dear aunt Adele (Antje Traue), a painting which would soon be taken by the Nazis and, after World War II, end up in a Vienna art museum where it became so revered that one character calls it ""the Mona Lisa of Austria"".When Maria (played as an old woman by Dame Helen Mirren) loses her sister, she discovers some letters that, along with 1990s changes in Austrian law, make her think that she might reclaim what once belonged to her family. She enlists the help of Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds), a friend's son, to look into the matter for her. Randy is a young attorney who has just started a new job and whose wife (Katie Holmes) is concerned about the impact of a lengthy case on their growing family, but he becomes obsessed with Maria's cause. In Austria, Randy gains the assistance of a local journalist (Daniel Brühl), but this long and complicated bureaucratic and legal struggle may prove to be too much for any of them, or even all of them. If you ever start to think that this lengthy and emotionally taxing fight is merely about the extremely high value of the painting or even one woman's need for closure, you'll remember Maria ending a conversation about her motivations with ""and then there's justice."" ""Woman in Gold"" has something for everyone. It's an unusually dramatic history lesson, a riveting drama, an involving mystery, a fascinating legal thriller and a touching story of families and friendships. All members of the very talented cast bring their ""A game"", the writing is excellent and the editing is superb. All these factors come together in a narrative which transitions seamlessly between the story's present and its past, doing so as effectively as I've ever seen it done. The opening of the movie, a short scene involving the creation of the painting, effortlessly but effectively communicates how special the painting of the title really is. The film shows the plight of the Jews in Europe more personally than any film since ""Schindler's List"", but without being overwrought. It also sheds light on what it meant for a country to capitulate to the Nazis as well as the long-term effects of that chapter in history. Many scenes in the movie are dramatic and suspenseful, but the portion of the film in which Maria and her husband escape Austria is on par with the climactic scenes in Oscar-winning films like ""Argo"" and ""The Sound of Music"". Whichever genre or cubby hole that professional critics choose to place this movie in, it rises above most films to which it might be compared.Like a great painting, a great film is a joy and an honor to see for yourself. I hope that ""Woman in Gold"" is remembered when all those gold statuettes are handed out this next awards season. The worth of the movie is, in the end, only my opinion, but this film informed me, educated me, enlightened me, uplifted me, and, as a wonderful work of art, it entertained me.

disappointing,"i hated this movie. the director and screenplay writer are primarily TV, rather than film veterans and this movie had all the elegance and refinement of a mediocre made for TV movie. The story itself, of an Austrian family whose art treasures were stolen by the Nazis in WWII, is extremely interesting and compelling, but this movie was an opportunity wasted. The usual elements that characterize TV movies - manipulative, cloying sentimentality, one dimensional characters, bad acting, and lack of subtlety were present in this film, (although the screenplay did a nice job of relating the legal background and historical events).Although Helen Mirren's character, Maria Altmann, was portrayed as one dimensional, Mirren was spectacular and salvaged some element of redemption for the film, and some of the other performances were very good. The choice of Ryan Reynolds as the co-lead was curious, as he is not known for his dramatic depth. Not surprisingly (and despite the fake glasses and stooped posture), he was moribund and uninteresting to watch. Katie Holmes, as his wife, was atrocious.I could hardly wait for this movie to end.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Fascinating story brought down a little by some cliches,"Thiis film is about an elderly Jewish woman, living in LA, who fled the Nazis Following the death of her sister, she attempts to reclaim the magnificent Klimt paintings, including the painting in the title, looted by the Nazis from her family home in Vienna and now in one of Vienna's great museums.The film is about the woman's coming to terms with her past and the attempt to see justice done; and also about her young lawyer's growing awareness about his past. He is the grandson of the Austrian-Jewish composer Arnold Schoenberg, who also fled the Nazis.I liked the film, which received mixed reviews. There are a few annoying cliches, particularly in the relationship between the young lawyer and his wife. Some reviewers said the film was a dull movie about a fascinating true story, but I didn't find it dull at all.

Perfection,"This movie is just flawless in any category; acting, cinematography, sound, locations, story flow. Helen Mirren is of course the star but everybody else involved were perfect also. Telling the young woman's life story, their hair-raising escape from Nazi occupation, and at the same time describing the red tape involved in trying to get back stolen family property by the Nazi's 50 years prior is just a stunning accomplishment. But, the icing on the cake, which they could have ignored, is how most of the population of Austria (and other European countries) colluded with the Nazi's.This is such an incredible movie, it should be required screening in high schools, it should never be forgotten what happens when hate and prejudice team up with apathy. No graphic violence is required to get the message across - classy all the way.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An interesting movie that deviates a fair amount from the historical facts,"This movie recounts the efforts of the niece of the woman portrayed in painter Gustave Klimt's famous ""The Woman in Gold"" to have it restored to her in the 1990s, after it had been looted by the Nazis during World War II and then hung for decades in the great Belvedere Art Museum in Vienna. I recall when Ms. Altmann undertook her quest through the courts but, fortunately, I did not remember how it went or the outcome, so all that could be a surprise for me.I have since read the book that serves as a point of departure for this feature film, Anne-Marie O'Connor's *The Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Tale of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer*. I now know that this movie often departs from the facts, especially in recounting the efforts of Altmann and her lawyer, Schoenberg, to get the painting. That doesn't influence my view of the movie, but movie-goers should know that it is not a documentary.For me, one of the two outstanding aspects of this movie is Mirrin's portrayal of Maria Altmann. When the script gives her even half a chance, she develops an interesting and complex character. After seeing her last year as the owner of a rural French restaurant in *The Hundred Foot Journey*, it was fascinating to see her as an Austrian refugee. I knew such people when I was growing up in Milwaukee in the 1950s and 60s, and I found her portrayal very convincing.The other aspect that was sometimes but not always good was the script. Yes, there were times when it gave in to sentiment or just dawdled. But sometimes it made a real and successful effort to present its two main characters as more than just two-dimensional figures. For what it's worth, it makes both of them, and especially the lawyer, far more sympathetic than they appear to have been in real life.There were things it could have developed more that would have made this a richer experience to watch:1) Near the end, Maria recalls her father saying to her that when their family came to Vienna, they made an effort to fit in and contribute to the city. It would have been nice if that had been developed more. We see presumably non-Jewish Viennese watching with pleasure the Nazis' humiliation of Jews, but we get no sense of whether this came as a surprise to Maria's family, whether they felt totally integrated, etc.2) Whether or not the real Austrian officials were officious and cold, it would have been more interesting if their representatives in the movie had been less stereotypical and given more chance to express the complexity of the issues they were defending. O'Connor's book does that.3) It might also have been interesting to have some insight into the Jewish Austrain refugee community in Los Angeles, of which Schönberg (the composer grandfather of the lawyer) was so important a part. The lawyer is given no chance to speak about what it must have been like to grow up in that community, what was talked about, etc. When he and Maria visit the Holocaust Memorial in Vienna and he is so moved that he has to excuse himself to hide his emotions, that would have been a moment to let us know WHY he was so moved, what memories from his childhood the Memorial reawakened.4) Near the end, when Maria recalls her aunt talking to her about the Klimt painting, Adele says she hopes that Maria, when she grows up, won't have to devote her life to superficial things. Given the surface glimmer of the painting in question, which seems to suggest something of the sort itself, the movie could have done a lot more with the implications of the painting as a depiction of a certain type of beautiful but ultimately superficial life. Was there a conflict between Maria's father's love of playing the cello, with its deep, rich sounds, and Klimt's use of gold leaf to portray Adele and her sad eyes? What was the culture like that Maria wanted the world to remember? If she is going to use the painting to make us remember it, what is the painting saying about that culture? That one line near the end of the movie should either have been cut or developed throughout the movie.When I got home and thought about this, I remembered that Adele died in 1923. At that point Maria, born in 1916, was only 7. The Bloch-Bauers would have been driven from their Vienna home in 1938, when the Nazis took over Austria. All of which to say that, by 1938 Maria would have lived with her Aunt Adele only 7 years, but the painting 22 years. Much more could have been made of the relationship with her Aunt - there is really only that one scene at the end - and the role the painting played for Maria as a memento of her aunt and that relationship during the 15 years after Adele's death that Maria lived with the painting. Also how that very distinctive painting shaped Maria's memories of Adele.It's true: as I develop this review, I am coming to realize that while the script has some good scenes in it, it really could have been a lot better developed.Still and all, the movie held me, and sometimes moved me very much. Very frankly, I found it did a better job than *Monuments Men*, which deals with a similar topic - Nazi pillaging of art during World War II - but in a more diffuse way that focuses on the American efforts to rescue the art rather than the meaning the art had to some of its owners. In that sense, this is closer to *The Train*, which remains, to my mind, the best movie treatment of the topic.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Justice is Done,"Before seeing Woman in Gold, I read three to four reviews, ranging from ""ordinary"" to ""extraordinary movie."" I was more than curious, since I am an historian and secondary ed teacher, always looking for excellent historical films that remind us ""why"" we study history. This film presents a WWII story with superb storytelling. Woman in Gold is about a survivor of World War II, named Maria Altmann, a Viennese who wants a famous family painting by Gustav Klimt returned to her possession since it was stolen by the Nazis. She enlists the help of a family friend, who also has a WWII connection, although he is quite inexperienced for the challenge of taking on the Austrian government. The painting of her aunt is famous for its size, the gold leaf, and its early twentieth century modernity. Even if you are ignorant about art history, this ""Mona Lisa"" of Austria, the Woman in Gold, is recognizable to almost everyone else. Maria Altmann's connection to this stellar painting by Gustav Klimt is that it reminds her not only of her aunt, but the family, friends, and life style that she lost forever when she fled Vienna with little more than the clothes on her back. The fight she and Randy Schoenberg, yes - grandson of Arnold Schoenberg - are about to wage is insurmountable if you have studied recent Austrian attempts to conceal its Nazi past. Think Kurt Waldheim. Woman in Gold is told in two stories, one about the pursuit of justice, and the other flashbacks before and after the Nazis occupied Vienna, showing Maria's lost life. Edited together, you get enough background into the Holocaust to understand Maria Altmann's motivation to seek long-awaited justice not just for herself, but all the other people who lost everything with little to no hope of restitution. The director, screenwriter, set designer, and all the actors did a fabulous job of finding a balance between humor and poignancy. Woman in Gold complements those other wonderful WWII movies, like Downfall, Lucie Aubrac, The Pianist, by showing that WWII history is not dead, that new chapters are being written in the 21st century.",10.0,Anonymous,History
All That Glitters...,"(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended.In brief: No Midas touch...a serious-minded film that only scratches the surface of its important subject.GRADE: B-It seems standard practice nowadays that whenever a film is touted ""based on true events"", it is far from true. Upon researching this biography of Adele Bloch-Bauer and her family, that much is true. The gold standard has been slightly devalued in this noble effort that tells its ""true"" story in the most melodramatic of ways. Woman in Gold simplifies an important issue (the ethical matter of stolen art during the Nazi reign) and tries to personalize this historic event with stick figures as its characters and the wobbliest of story as its source. While it certainly is engrossing fare, it's a foolhardy result.￼Set in Vienna, the film centers on Klimt's masterwork, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I. Once owned by the family and taken away from this Jewish clan and now the property of the Viennese government, the painting is now the treasure in question. A legal fight ensues. In one corner stands our worthy contender, ""Saint"" Maria Altman (Helen Mirren), who if we are to believe, wants this artwork back in her possession for strictly personal reasons as the painting depicts her dearly beloved grandmother. Taking her case is a young idealistic lawyer, Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds). In the other corner are those nasty governmental bureaucrats who want to keep the work of art for its people as a symbol of patriotism and national pride. And the financial worth of the piece sure doesn't hurt either.￼The painting becomes the MacGuffin in this film that brings on the conflict and unites both parties in their battle over ownership. Alexi Kaye Campbell's misbegotten screenplay sees the issue in only black and white terms, with its stilted arguments and painted in the broadest of brush-strokes that never resemble anything remotely realistic. There is no balance in this weighty matter with all sympathies going to our stoic heroine from the outset.Adequately directed by Simon Curtis, the film carries its self-importance as its main pedigree. Adele is a feisty and strong-willed character, a predictable combination for the crowd- pleasing audience to root for and Dame Helen energizes the proceeding with her finely nuanced portrayal of a woman determined to fight injustice. But the film's lack of reality is the real crime in question. (Granted the tale spans decades, yet it should still adhere to the facts more closely...which it does not.) Mr. Reynolds is miscast in the crusader role, part nebbish and part idealistic hero as written, although the actor is never that convincing in the latter. Also in the cast are Daniel Bruhl as Hubertus Czernin, an ally to the cause, Tatiana Maslany as the younger Adele, Max Irons as her husband, and Henry Goodman as her father (in flashbacks), all contributing greatly to their underdeveloped characters. More support is given by Charles Dance, Elizabeth McGovern, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Pryce, and Katie Holmes as Pam, all talent wasted.Woman in Gold is a riveting tale. The subject matter alone is compelling, but it remains pure fool's gold in its filmmaking efforts. See this docudrama for the glowing Ms. Mirren and the glorious artwork on display. They're priceless.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing - A punch to the stomach,"I think it's the best movie I have seen this year! Helen Mirren was simply breathtaking! A movie filled with history and amazing scenes from the Nazi era in Austria, a movie filled with the sense of justice and the longing for making things right. Ryan Reynolds was up to the task, although I was kind of fearful of whether or not he would manage to stand beside this great lady.I enjoyed the flashbacks of the movie, and really sympathized with the drama of the Jews of Austria. An amazing movie coming in a time when the extreme parties around Europe are growing exponentially, to show us what really matters in the end and how the horrific actions of the Nazis have ruined the life of so many people.In the end of the movie, you feel moved, you feel complete and you feel warm in the inside.

"Really slow going, at first, but quite captivating by it's conclusion!","'WOMAN IN GOLD': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)British- American drama flick starring Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds and directed by Simon Curtis (who also directed another historical drama flick: 'MY WEEK WITH MARILYN'). It tells the true story of a Jewish refugee, in her 80s, who battled the Austrian government for nearly a decade; to regain control of famous artwork (especially a painting of her aunt, known as the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I), which was taken from her family by the Nazis before the war. Mirren plays the Jewish refugee and Reynolds plays the young American lawyer that helped her. The film costars Daniel Bruhl, Katie Holmes, Max Irons, Charles Dance, Jonathan Pryce and Elizabeth McGovern. It was written by Alexi Kaye Campbell and based on the life stories of Maria Altmann and E. Randol Schoenberg. I found the movie to be really slow going, at first, but quite captivating by it's conclusion.Maria Altmann (Mirren) was a young Jewish woman (played by Tatiana Maslany, in her earlier years) who fled Austria, with her husband Fritz (Irons), as the Nazis were taking it over, right before World War II. Family art, including a painting of Maria's aunt, were seized by the Nazis, shortly later, and after the war the Austrian government took possession of them. The artwork became very valuable and iconic over the years (especially the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I). Maria decided, while in her 80s, to fight to get them back; due to their sentimental value, and the fact that they rightfully belonged to her. She enlisted the help of a young, and very inexperienced, lawyer named Randol Schoenberg (Reynolds).The movie is powerfully acted (especially by it's two leads) and decently directed; but the story could have played out in a much more emotionally charged and engaging way. As it is, it takes a long time to really catch the viewer's interest. Once it gets to the meat of the story, though, it's very involving stuff. By the end of the film, I was quite satisfied with it; but I can't dismiss the first 30 to 45 minutes, of rather dull material I had to sit through. It's a decent film but it could have been even better.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/rxD9sln4Qkg",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Well, *I* liked it!","I just got home from seeing this film, and I very much enjoyed it. I've been reading some of the negative reviews and trying to understand what they're on about, but I just don't get it. I think it was a great film and I'm glad I saw it. OK, maybe following all the legal machinations gets a little dry at points, but I'm happy with this. It means that the film makers *respect* the story. This isn't one of those atrocities that claims to be based on history, but in fact plays so fast-and-loose with the facts that what you are getting is almost entirely fiction (yes, ""The Imitation Game"", I'm looking at *you*). While I don't know the details of the actual history in this case, from what I'm able to make out it seems like this film stays pretty true to the facts. I, for one, am glad they resisted the trend of schmaltzing the thing up.",8.0,Anonymous,History
an uninspired hack job with an industrially designed wrapping can appeal to the lowest common denominator,"The real story itself has every aspect to be an uplifting material for a big screen adaptation, the Republic of Austria v. Altmann case, the righteous Jewish octogenarian Maria Altmann (Mirren) against the acquisitive Austrian government machinery, for the right of Gustav Klimt's $135 million worth painting Woman in Gold, where Maria's aunt Adele (Traue) is the said woman, and as a refugee fled from her homeland under the persecution of Nazis half a century ago, Maria has every right to get what belongs to her family and at the same time, to make peace with the mixed feeling towards her native land.But when $135 million is at stake, the story itself cannot dodge a cynic suspicion of how lofty the cause is, as Maria's lawyer Randy Schoenberg (Reynolds), a fellow Austrian descendant, the grandson of the well-known composer Arnold Schoenberg, ruefully admits in the middle section of the movie to his wife Pam (Holmes), he takes on the case for the sake of money, only later he becomes a more persistent driving force for the case when his personal connection with the cause being vicariously activated through this tough journey. But for Maria, screenwriter Alexi Kaye Campbell doesn't budge an inch on her integrity, although the aftermath is that the painting is geographically relocated from a museum in Vienna to another museum in New York City, while Maria earns a ginormous fortune by selling it, instead of keeping it as a personal treasure. No one should blame her since if that windfall befalls on any of us, we will most likely make the same decision under the circumstance, but a tangy odour of whitewash is frustrating and bothersome as a default blemish for the hagiography genre, not to mention a self-boosting chauvinism does't help either.Overtly this film resembles another Dame star vehicle PHILOMENA (2013), both fare quite healthy in the box office, which means this sub-genre does have its potential ticket-buyers, but as a Weinstein project, I doubt WOMAN IN GOLD will have any weighty influence on the Oscar race like the Dench-Coogan pic. First of all, the odd pair of Mirren and Reynolds doesn't register a tangible bond with humour and warmth which actually is so adroitly exerted by Dench and Coogan. Dame Mirren shines in a dignified impression which has no fault to pick albeit the character itself is flatter than we imagined. Reynolds acts up in several emotion-emancipating scenes, but overall, too hammy to take it in. Also, PHILOMENA is a more personal rite-of-passage of finding forgiveness in the most atrocious activity can ever incur on oneself, while WOMEN IN GOLD is more or less bordering on an ostentatious smash which panders to the audience stateside.One surprising discovery is Tatiana Maslany, who plays the young Maria, and the star of the cult show ORPHAN BLACK. She is the saving grace in my opinion and authentically a leading lady material, also Antje Traue is a stunner in this generically mass-catering flick, director Simon Curtis' follow-up of his overvalued Oscar-player MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011) is acceptably on a par with his predecessor, it can woo you instantly on the garish face value, but afterwards, it is just an uninspired hack job with an industrially designed wrapping can appeal to the lowest common denominator.",6.0,Anonymous,History
When personality is squandered for linear storytelling,"""Woman in Gold"" tells an extraordinary story with the utmost ordinariness in style and structure. It uses what I fear will become the newfound ""Philomena"" cliché of a stubborn, moody old white lady getting helped by a square, middle-aged white man who grows to appreciate a walk of life he apparently never even knew existed before. The only difference was ""Philomena"" worked because of strong chemistry between its leads and a story that was told in an impacting manner, articulating the core of the events within proper emotional and narrative boundaries. ""Woman in Gold"" is what happens when all of that is traded for what looks to be a ""collect the check"" job on all fronts, where everyone involved just seems more concerned with collecting their pay rather than telling a story with the significance and heart it not only bears but deserves.The film revolves around Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren), a Jewish refugee living in Los Angeles, who seeks the help of a lawyer named Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) to recover Gustav Klimt's iconic painting of her aunt, known as Portrait of Adele Block-Bauer I. During the time of World War II, the painting was confiscated by the Nazis and now hangs in a museum in Vienna, Austria, where it is as renowned as the Mona Lisa. Maria and Randol travel to Vienna to try and convince the Austrian government to allow Maria to claim the painting, but the government has made it virtually impossible for anyone who isn't wealthy beyond their wildest imagination to sue or challenge the government. Eventually, the two return to America, following a breathless bout of walking in circles, to discover that they can sue the Austrian government on American soil due to the painting being licensed for commercial use in America. What entails is an exhausting legal battle that is taken all the way to the Supreme Court.""Woman in Gold""'s first immediate problem is it can't do anything without oversimplifying. Within the first fifteen minutes of the film, Maria meets Randol, she tell him the story of her aunt and Klimt's painting, and they are off to Vienna in a flash. The legal battle that apparently takes so many months to progress and move to the Supreme Court is covered within about five minutes in montage and, when we do see glimpses inside the courtroom, it's the same kind of artificial, theatrical environment we've grown accustomed to in American movies. Finally, every wall the characters run into in their quest to obtain what is rightfully theirs always seems to pose a way out that's almost too clean to exist. Every way around the Austrian government is portrayed as a flash-in-the-pan, revolutionary moment that makes you wonder why these two bright individuals didn't think of that before they started (IE: the cost of suing the Austrian government being in the millions - shouldn't they have known that as a ""worst case scenario"" event?).It's also worth noting that it's impossible for a dynamic to be achieved between both Mirren and Reynolds because screenwriter Alexi Kaye Campbell doesn't write a line of dialog that's purpose is to paint both of these individuals as characters and not narrative vessels. Every conversation these two have between one another is about the case or about the history; none of dialog works to humanize either party and it isn't until the end we realize that due to how little we're impacted by the outcome of it all. This gives ""Woman in Gold"" a dreary and dull personality, and makes it even more disappointing to see two great actors squandered for the sake of persistent plot progression.""Woman in Gold"" is one of several films to be released over the last two years that concerns art, the creation of art, and to whom the art should belong to. Last year, George Clooney's ""The Monuments Men"" was a misguided effort, but found success in at least detailing the process of obtaining valuable works that the Nazis had stolen, a subject that's only now really circulating into the mainstream. In addition, we also had Tim Burton's ""Big Eyes,"" which, while a bit different, found itself infusing style and visual flair into a story that probably wouldn't have clicked had no personality been injected into the screenplay and the visual aesthetic. ""Woman in Gold"" is another film that takes a hugely important topic and squanders it, and, now more than ever, we need not only another film on Nazi art thieves, but a good one at long last.",4.0,Anonymous,History
A triumphant journey,"This film tells the story of a old woman who moved to USA to escaped Nazi rule in Austria when she was young. She finds documentary proof in her late sister's belongings that several priceless paintings are stolen from her family, and are now in the possession of a state museum.""Woman in Gold"" is a beautiful film because it's a journey of three people working hard for a common goal for slightly different reasons. I'm impressed by the lawyer's enthusiasm in taking up Maria's case. He shows much dedication and professionalism. Maria's goal to take back the paintings is to keep memories alive, which is very touching. The atmosphere of the film is kept quite serious but not sombre, which is not easy for a film about the persecution of Jews. Overall, I think this film portrays a triumphant journey, and is very touching.",,Anonymous,History

Good Blending Of A Contemporary Legal Battle With Reflections On History,"I wasn't at all sure how interesting I would find this movie. It deals with an issue of importance. It's about the fight for restitution - the fight to return to Holocaust families or their descendants works of art that were stolen by the Nazis in Austria and then never returned by future Austrian governments. In particular, it's the story of Maria Altmann (played by Helen Mirren) - an aging woman whose parents perished in the Holocaust and who desperately wants back from a Vienna museum a portrait (dubbed the Woman in Gold) of her late aunt. To her, the painting represents a connection with her past and with her extended family and with happier times before the insanity of Nazism shattered so many lives. To the Austrian government, the painting is a piece of the national culture, and it's extremely valuable. Engaging the services of a young American attorney (played by Ryan Reynolds) the movie shows us the fight for the painting in both US courts and with various Austrian officials and arbitrations.That is an important subject. People should have a right to what's theirs, and surely the Austrian government shouldn't want to keep that which was stolen by the Nazis? But, of course, as the movie alludes to, the Austrian government itself is less than open about the country's Nazi history, and many Austrians just want such claims to be tossed aside. I have to say that while the movie certainly makes you sympathize with Maria's battle, in truth I didn't find the legal battle over the painting to be especially riveting. And yet, even if the primary storyline of the movie didn't especially reel me in, the movie worked for me.What really worked well was the interspersing of Maria's history throughout as flashbacks. We see the family in happy (pre-Nazi) times in Vienna, with Maria loved and cared for by her parents and by her aunt and uncle. We see the beginnings of the Nazi occupation and takeover and the growing anti-semitism of the country. We see Maria's escape (with her husband) from a Gestapo officer as they make it out of the country and to the US, and we see the heart- wrenching good-bye that Maria shared with her parents, as her father made one request of her: remember us. That particular scene came near the end of the movie and it helped put everything else in context. This wasn't about a painting. It was about honouring Maria's past - those she loved and who loved her.This had the potential to be a sombre movie, and yet it didn't become that, primarily thanks to the interplay between Mirren and Reynolds. They worked well together as a team, and there was often a humorous tinge to this very serious subject that made even the dryness (as I perceived it) of the legal battle over ownership of the painting to be easy to watch.Personally, I wouldn't rank this as a masterpiece, but it's a well done movie about a very important subject.

Uphill Crusade to Reclaim a Family Portrait--Beauty & Truth,"In Woman in Gold, Helen Mirren, chameleon-like, inhabits the body and personality of Maria Altmann, niece and heir of a prominent Jewish family in pre-WWII Vienna. The family's best-known member today is Maria's aunt Adele, whose portrait Gustav Klimt painted in 1907. The painting was appropriated during the Nazi era and for many years hung in the Austrian state's famous Belvedere Gallery, as ""the Mona Lisa of Vienna."" After her sister's death, Maria finds correspondence suggesting the painting was perhaps not left to the government of Austria in her aunt's will, as it claimed, and therefore not rightfully Austrian property. She hires a family friend's son, Randol Schoenberg (played by Ryan Reynolds), a young down-on-his-luck Los Angeles attorney, to look into the matter. Schoenberg, grandson of the composer—another refugee from Nazified Austria—is out of touch with his family's past and slow to recognize the significance of Maria's quest. Initially unwilling to take on the case, he is gradually drawn into it. Their bureaucratic battles with stonewalling Austrian officials soon unite the pair, and they are joined by a crusading Austrian journalist, Hubertus Czernin. Formidable legal and bureaucratic hurdles stand in the way of Maria being reuniting with the painting—""When you look at this painting, you see a work of art,"" Marie tells a reunification commission, ""I see my aunt."" The story is another in a long line of mostly not happy stories of stolen art works in World War II, brought to renewed public awareness by movies and books like The Monuments Men and Pictures at an Exhibition. The opportunity to reunite beloved works of art and their owners is rapidly disappearing, yet this beautifully filmed movie, directed by Simon Curtis, shows the importance of continuing these efforts. Because this film is based on a true story, and I for one remembered how it ends, a certain inevitability about the outcome guides the plot. Perhaps this is what has caused reviewers (not me!) to find it dull, though they find the actors captivating. As a result of the strong positive audience reception, the film's distributor will greatly expand its national distribution.

"Crucial film, so history does not repeat.","WOMAN IN GOLD Ultimately, WOMAN IN GOLD is a film about the struggle of the little man against an overwhelming, ruling power. It is the antithesis of the adage ""you can't fight city hall"". These stories always play well with viewers, and WOMAN IN GOLD should not prove the exception to the rule. It is, after all, a story which needs to remain in our psyche, especially in times like these when an incompetent president and his administration and lackeys seem intent on history repeating.THE WOMAN IN GOLD is the story of Maria Altmann, played by Helen Mirren. She was a member of a prestigious family in Austria, before the invasion of the Nazis. Her home and family were destroyed and valuable art treasures stolen from their home. Now, as Austria recognizes its compliance in history with the Nazi movement, the government opts to hear cases for restitution for those WWII victims. Altmann wants her family's paintings returned, especially one of her aunt, with whom she shared a special friendship. Like most governments, however, Austria is not willing to release the paintings, claiming they are now the country's property and part of its historic culture. Faced with the prospect of challenging an entire government, coupled with museum curators and corrupt politicians, Altmann enlists the aide of her friend's son, Randol Schoenberg, played by Ryan Reynolds.It's quite easy to mock and jeer at Reynolds. Movie-goers hold him responsible for THE GREEN LANTERN, a better than average superhero film that somehow captured the ridicule of comic geeks. The same group is already condemning his turn as Deadpool in an upcoming X-Men adventure. Reynolds is suffering the same fate Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck suffered years back. Now, both are holding Oscars and McConaughey is driving a Lincoln and being parodied by Jim Carrey.Reynolds is fine in this film. He plays well off of Mirren. The story is, in essence, a tale of his coming of age in relation to his heritage. Like many Millennials, Schoenberg thinks the world began with his birthday. It takes a trip to Austria for him to discover the importance and significance of his birthright.WOMAN IN GOLD drags at times, making it seem longer than its actual length. Some scenes are repetitious. Surprisingly, others are stilted. This occurs due to remedial dialogue, penned by Alexi Kaye Campbell. Luckily, Reynolds and Mirren are quality actors and able to salvage the scenes.The past six years produced a paradigm shift in culturally accepted indignation. As the Obama Regime consistently turns its back on Israel and promotes anti-Semitism, Holocaust themed tomes are deemed trivial; an obsession by those forever living in the past. Meanwhile, films on slavery and black oppression are elevated to royal status, with private screenings in the White House mandated. America's first black president, second if you believe Bill Clinton, made race relations prominent and the Holocaust insignificant. Look at the films released in the last six years as evidence.Still, at a time when several Middle East countries and militias are stating their mission to eradicate Israel from the globe and further seek the destruction of America, for it is in their eyes, the Great Satan, the lessons of the Holocaust must not be forgotten. Films like WOMAN IN GOLD should help keep the memories alive. History is repeating itself. Muslim leaders are spewing the same rhetoric as Hitler once did, and our current leadership is all too willing to support them. It is akin to Roosevelt and Churchill siding with the Nazis.WOMAN IN GOLD could have more of an impact, with better seamless transitions between segments and stronger scripting; however, the film is salvaged by the power of its stars and their ability to elevate mediocre material. The film is crucial to see for a reminder of what happened in the past and the ability to have the jurisprudence not to let it happen again today.",7.0,Anonymous,History

This is a fine two hours of solid entertainment buoyed by a outstanding performance by Helen Mirren. Yes, there are weaknesses in the script, but it's still a very much worth seeing. The storyline is provocative. Do the wounds of bigotry and injustice every leave us? Will justice take away the pain of genocide?

There are just too many...)

Art and artifice,"The title suggests this is going to be a ""Woman's Picture"" - and it is. But a high-quality woman's picture. And an uplifting true-life story.Maria Altmann is feisty and tetchy and magnificently determined. Mirren plays her in a slight twist on her portrayal of Elizabeth II, with a piled-on Austrian accent (no jokes about the Queen's Teutonic pedigree, if you please); I found myself wondering if Meryl Streep had been approached for the role, accents being very much her thing. Reynolds does a nice turn as the nerdy but equally resolute lawyer, the kind of role Gregory Peck made his name in.The movie has a sort of 'sheen' to it, which occasionally makes it seem a tad schmaltzy, and the flashbacks to the gilded glamour of pre-war Vienna are definitely over-polished. As in George Clooney's THE MONUMENTS MEN, the theft of paintings is almost allowed to eclipse the true horrors of what the Nazis did to Europe's Jews. The intransigence of today's Austrian art custodians - and its legal system - provides a neatly different chill.The scenes I liked most were those (three of them) in which past and present are allowed to meld together. This device was briefly and subtly used in the Merchant-Ivory HEAT AND DUST (1983). It's less subtly employed here, but it helps to make the film memorable. WOMAN IN GOLD is a beguiling work of art and artifice, handsomely framed.",8.0,Anonymous,History
to love art is to love life,"During their occupation of Europe, the Nazis looted countless paintings. The paintings' rightful owners later spent years trying to reclaim them.

Altmann's quest to reclaim the painting turned into a tug-of-war between the US and Austria in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Simon Curtis's ""Woman in Gold"" tells this story, starring Helen Mirren as Altmann and Ryan Reynolds as her lawyer. Part of what we see is how the lawyer - whose superiors at the law firm are REAL jerks - starts out isolated from his family history, but the trial reconnects him. I didn't even know about this story until the movie got released.Does the movie have any downside? Well, it's likely that Altmann's family made their wealth by paying slave wages, and the movie never addresses this. Of course, Hitler used the Jews' economic success to depict the Jews as money-grubbers, so this might not be the best place to address it.Overall, I recommend the movie. This is a part of history that no one should ever forget.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Why all the criticism?,"I fail to understand the criticism levelled at this worthy legal drama, particularly Peter Bradshaw's scathing review for The Guardian newspaper.Helen Mirren again turns in another good performance although the real surprise is Ryan Reynolds turn as her naïve but well meaning lawyer, in over his head (just as Matt Damon was in 1997's The Rainmaker) against the state of Austria.That this is based on a true story seems to have been overlooked by the critics. The concept that Mirren's character was trying to retrieve a famous piece of art, a painting of her aunt, that was stolen by the Nazi's and ended up in a Viennese museum resonates as just a small piece of the injustices dealt to the Jews. That the museum refuses to hand it over by trying every excuse possible resulting in a David vs Goliath showdown and the animosity that gets built up just adds to the flavour.Yes, maybe the story has been oversimplified for the purposes of the film, and that for the sake of the story 2 years is very conveniently squashed down into a few minutes, but this is still a decent legal drama with a human interest story (told partly in flashback). I certainly enjoyed the film and so did the audience.Perhaps the critics didn't like it because it lacked any car chases, is fairly pedestrian in its pacing or that it demonises at least some of the Austrian people, for both being complicit in pre-war anti Semitism and the lack of acknowledgement to her plight. I cannot argue with these points but then again it isn't trying to be Schindlers List either. It was probably no coincidence that the vast majority of the audience was an older audience but there should always be a place in cinema for human interest stories too. This is a film about one woman's experience of what the Nazi's did to her, her family, her friends and her attempts to at least try and redress some of the injustices dealt to her. Maybe it won't win any Oscars but I would certainly recommend it for those who like old an fashioned drama based on a true story.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Art for art's sake?,"You can of course ask yourself whether a woman in Los Angeles wanting her Gustaf Klimt painting back is interesting. Although it was stolen by the Nazis. This is however what this is about.Of course it's not just about that. It's about retroactive acceptance of one's past, even if it's evil. Like in the case of Austria. In this movie anyway.Helen Mirren never destroys anything, but one wonders a little why she takes part in something based on such a simple script. Including those Austrian museum officials, who are a little too square, really. Entertaining film, yes, but so completely doing the right movie the right way.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Lifeless and dull,"""If life is a race, you beat me to the finish. But if life is a boxing match, I'm the last one standing.""Based on true events, Woman in Gold is one of those films that ended up being far less interesting than the actual story it was trying to tell. If The Monuments Men failed to appeal to a wide audience I wonder what the producers of this film were thinking. It too centers on stolen artwork during the Second World War, but it takes us through the litigation process that Maria Altmann went through to try to regain what rightfully belonged to her family. At least The Monuments Men focused on a group of men trying to save famous artwork from being destroyed with a touch of comedy, but Woman in Gold is more of a dragged out drama with forced sentimentality. The general premise might be similar to that film, but in a way it also can be compared to Philomena considering the lead characters are played by an unlikely duo. In The Woman in Gold the pairing is between Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds. Reynolds is Randy Schoenberg, a young attorney who gets involved with a case that Maria Altmann (Mirren) presents him with. She's a Jewish refugee with a wealthy Austrian background. When the Nazis occupied Austria she had to watch how all these valuable art pieces were taken away from her family by these soldiers. Among them was one of Gustav Klimt's famous paintings, a portrait of her aunt known as Woman in Gold. Now almost have a century later she asks Randy to represent her and help her get the painting back which is held at an Austrian Museum. When Randy discovers the painting is worth more than one hundred million dollars, he doesn't hesitate to help her and so their unlikely relationship takes off as does their difficult task.The chemistry between Reynolds and Mirren is solid, but I wouldn't say it comes close to being as charming as Coogan and Dench were in Philomena. The pacing in this film was tedious and I found most of the dramatic moments manipulative and overly sentimental. As good as an actress Mirren is, she wasn't given strong material to work with. She makes some witty and sassy remarks during a couple of confrontation scenes with some of the Austrian diplomats, but that is about it. Reynolds gets the look and the style of the 90's spot on, but there wasn't much to his character. I felt like this film worked basically as a timeline where we are introduced to important events, but we never really got to know these characters or how they related with one another. Fortunately the timeline wasn't told in chronological order, we get several flashbacks to when Maria was a child and to when she was a young woman fleeing from the Nazi officials, so at least we get some parallel action scenes. I'd say that those flashbacks were the most entertaining part of the movie. Tatiana Maslany played the young Maria Altmann and she delivers the best performance in the film. There is a great scene where she and her husband are fleeing from the officials, but that was one of the only few scenes where I felt engaged with the film. The story is a fascinating one, but one that I would've been better off reading about considering the film only seemed interested in telling the story rather than letting us get to know the characters.Despite having a talented supporting cast, the screenplay by Alexi Kaye Campbell fails to give these characters any life. Take Katie Holmes for instance, who plays Randy's wife. She is given nothing to do except play the role of the wife without any dimension whatsoever to her character. The film fails to explore these dynamics between the characters because it's only interested in presenting the facts. Daniel Bruhl is also underused as he only seems to be in the film to remind Randy and Maria what a difficult task they are going to have despite the help he provides for them. The same can be said about the rest of the supporting cast including Max Irons, Charles Dance, and Jonathan Pryce. The film tries so hard to be about something important (mostly about being able to reconcile with the past) but Simon Curtis's film is unfortunately so dull that it fails to do so. It doesn't bring anything new to the familiar David versus Goliath tale and despite taking so much time to remind us what a difficult task this is going to be, the resolution seemed way too simple at the end. There are far better films that tackle the subject matter in a less manipulative way.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",4.0,Anonymous,History
Tracing the Threads of History and Art,"Woman in Gold revolves around the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, painted in 1907 by the Austrian artist, Gustav Klimt. The painting was seized by the Nazis, who sought to erase its Jewish origins and renamed it Woman in Gold. This painting, one of Klimt's masterpieces, was returned to Maria Altmann, Adele's niece, by the Austrian government in 2005 after a protracted legal battle. It had been showcased in the Belvedere Museum, considered the ""Mona Lisa of Austria"" and a ""national treasure"".The central character of the film, Maria (Helen Mirren) is neither an artist nor a model, yet her life is intricately woven into the turbulent times and the destiny of the painting. With the help of a young and inexperienced lawyer but full of zeal, Maria embarks on a relentless quest to reclaim her family's prized paintings. For her, this journey is not just about valuable artwork, worth millions of dollars; it's a journey filled with the memory of her beloved Aunt Adele, of a time of warmth and comfort in Vienna, of the undeniable proof of the wartime atrocities she, like countless other Jews, endured. Maria refuses to let time bury these memories, turning her aunt Adele into a mere ""woman in gold"", while the younger generation forgets the harrowing history of this illustrious city.Between the intriguing legal battles against the Austrian government, Maria's longing for the memories she had sought to bury resurfaces. These are the moments when Maria wishes to share her past, offering glimpses into her affection for Aunt Adele and the idyllic, prosperous days of her family in Vienna, and her marriage to a young artist. All of this is shattered when the Nazis occupied Austria, and Maria's family, like millions of other Jews, faced inescapable tragedy. Through the film, Maria takes the audience on a journey through history, confronting the past.While appearing briefly in a few scenes, Adele Bloch-Bauer's character leaves an indelible mark on the audience with her grace, ethereal beauty, and her profound, gentle thoughts. Klimt painted Adele with love and reverence, and Maria views Adele's portrait with a tapestry of memories, both joyful and sorrowful. Posterity, in turn, will regard the woman in gold as an icon of 20th-century European art and history.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This is a top-quality movie,"This is a top-quality movie with great acting by Ryan Reynolds, Helen Mirren, and everyone else. I highly recommend it. Ryan Reynolds did some exceptionally good acting regarding Attorney Schoenberg's visit to the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna. The legal aspects of restitution will be especially interesting to attorneys and other legal professional staff. Also included in this movie is the issue of how relatives/descendants of Nazis cope with what happened.

Last Woman Standing,"This rather conventional drama with a somewhat confusing flashback structure treating us to both the inevitable nazis and more unusually Gustav Klimt speaking subtitled German marks yet another film that the presence alone of Dame Helen Mirren provides a reason to watch; particularly as it finally gives her the opportunity to play a Jewish matron. With a dark permanent wave and little button eyes she actually resembles Elizabeth II more here than she did as 'The Queen'.Charles Dance makes a brief appearance as his usual supercilious villain.

Far from Golden,"""Woman in Gold"" (2015), directed by Simon Curtis, is anchored by Mirren's performance. She has the sharp, intelligent, quintessentially Austrian character of Maria Altmann down to the slightest mannerism, Mirren disappearing into her character. It's to the credit of the script, by Alexi Kaye Campbell, that it creates a character so strongly delineated, as well as letting Mirren (who won an Academy Award for her performance in ""The Queen"" (2006)) suggest the inner vulnerabilities which her tough exterior seeks to hide.If it's a powerful, memorable performance, then it's unfortunate that it outclasses the surrounding film. The material, tackling the important issue of the repatriation of art stolen by the Nazis, to their true owners, highlights the complex nature of modern-day Austrian society, still uncomfortable about its role in aiding Hitler during World War II. However, Curtis doesn't seem up to the task. Previously having directed ""My Week with Marilyn"" (2011), his treatment too often errs on the side of the predictable, bathing flashbacks to the Anschluss (the German annexation of Austria in 1939) in the now customary desaturated palette, providing a gloss on the past. Neither is there the hoped-for dynamism in handling the complex series of court cases that had to be fought against the Austrian government, both in Austria and the United States. The intricacies are glazed over in favour of dramatic speeches, although Ryan Reynolds as the lawyer is surprisingly good and manages to play the moments of humour early on in the film to maximum effect.There's an extensive cast, including Daniel Brühl as a sympathetic Austrian journalist, Charles Dance enjoying himself as a brusque head of a law firm and Jonathan Pryce in one scene playing the Supreme Court's Chief Justice, William Rehnquist, although Katie Holmes is given nothing to do as Reynolds' wife.The film's major flaw then, is its script, from which Curtis is tied to. There's no insight into Klimt and the eponymous ""Woman in Gold"", Adele Bloch-Bauer I, is an exotic enigma, as flat as Klimt's portrait of her. Shot in opalescent golds, in a literal cinematic transcription of her portrait, we never know who she is. Tethered to Mirren's character childhood memories of her, her Austrian past is rendered as a simplistic golden era destroyed by the coming of Nazism. There's no attempt to confront the existing anti-Semitism that was rife in Austria throughout the early 20th century, long before Hitler's ascent to power; ultimately, the film sells the past short. It's on steadier ground with Mirren and Reynolds grappling with the Austrian government's attempts to frustrate their claims to Klimt's masterpiece and these are the best portions of the film, perhaps as it focuses on Mirren and Reynolds, who have an undeniable screen chemistry. It's thanks to their efforts that this film still remains worth viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"'They'll never admit to what they did, because if they admit to one thing, they'll have to admit to it all.'","'I have to do what I can to keep these memories alive, because people forget-especially the young.' Maria Altman. What a wonder of a film this is! Unfortunately it was released so early in the year that by the time the Academy Awards come 'round few will remember to place Helen Mirren's name on the list of Best Actress nominees.Simon Curtis directs this near docudrama with a flair for genuine feeling, for art, for music, and for history. Written by Alexi Kaye Campbell and based on books and notes by both Maria Altman and E. Randol Schönberg the script rings true and while providing a fine story it also reminds us of the atrocities inflicted upon the world by Hitler's Third Reich.The story is straight forward: the 80 year old Maria Altman (a radiant Dame Helen Mirren) engages a rookie young lawyer E. Randol Schönberg (finally an excellent acting role for Ryan Reynolds) who happens to be the grandson of the brilliant Austrian composer Arnold Schönberg to help her retrieve the painting 'Adele' (now simply known as 'Woman in Gold') – a Gustav Klimt painting belonging to her family and was stolen by the Nazis and is hanging in Austria's Belvedere. Randy is married (Katie Holmes) and has a child and another on the way and finally gets a new job with a law firm, so he is loathe to accompany Maria on a trip to Austria in an attempt to restitute the theft of her aunt Adele. When Randy learns of the value of the painting together with the other Klimt paints that belong to Maria he joins her (with making money in time). Through a well developed relationship between Maria and Randy and a very fine series of flashbacks to the time when the Nazi's were condemning Jews to death camps and stealing their property Randy and Maria ultimately triumph in what seems to be an impossible quest. In doing so Randy gains an appreciation for his background, his miraculous grandfather, and the realities of the Holocaust that is his heritage.In addition to Mirren and Reynolds the cast is consistently excellent – especially Daniel Brühl, Tatiana Maslany, Max Irons, Charles Dance, Elizabeth McGovern, Jonathan Pryce, Allan Corduner, Moritz Bleibtreu and all the others. The film also sensitively includes a performance of Arnold Schönberg's string sextet Verklärte Nacht – another act of homage among the many this film makes to the Austrian Jews who escaped to America. It is an enriching experience, worthy of many awards. Grady Harp, July 15",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Familiar Tale not Without its Clichéd Elements, but Compelling Nonetheless","WOMAN IN GOLD mines the apparently inexhaustible subject of Nazi atrocities during World War Two. This time it centers around Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren), an Austrian refugee forced to leave her homeland after the Anschluss of 1938, when Hitler's troops invaded. They came in and stole many of the family's treasures, including valuable paintings by Gustav Klimt. Three years later the paintings were given to the Belvedere Museum in Vienna, where they are still on display.After burrowing through long-lost paperwork, Maria and her companion, hotshot lawyer Randy Schönberg (Ryan Reynolds), the grandson of another refugee, the Austrian composer Arnold Schönberg, decide to take on the museum in an attempt to restore the paintings - especially the eponymous ""Woman in Gold"" (a painting of Altmann's aunt) to their rightful owner. There follows a series of courtroom battles, following the familiar trope of the little person taking on the institution.While Mirren offers us a convincing Austro-English accent, she is manifestly too young for the role (the real Altmann was in her eighties when she began efforts to pursue the Belvedere through the courts). At times it seems as if Mirren is offering us a reprise of her role in THE QUEEN (2006), right down to the sliver of lip-gloss on her otherwise pale features. Reynolds doesn't have much to do except to put on a concerned expression, especially while trying to deal with his wife Pam (Katie Holmes), and stand up bravely in court against the apparently implacable attorney working for the Austrian government (Rolf Saxon).What redeems the film is its palpable seriousness of purpose. Production designer Jim Clay has worked hard to recreate the atmosphere in the immediate wake of the Anschluss, where cheering crowds of Hitler supporters are counterbalanced by antisemitic mobs keen to root out as many so-called ""enemies of the state"" as possible. Most of the sequences taking place in the past are photographed in washed-out colors (by Ross Emery), that serve the symbolic function of suggesting how the Nazi occupation deprived what had been a multicultural society of much of its life-blood.Based on historical fact, the outcome can be easily discerned from about halfway through the film. Nonetheless director Curtis prompts us to reflect on the ethics of the entire campaign - although Maria deserves to have her family property restored to her, is the persistent campaign conducted on her behalf really worth it? What good does it do to rake up the past, especially the series of traumatic events leading up to and including her enforced flight from her homeland?",6.0,Anonymous,History

The story moves on a very emotional note as it shows the harassment and torture the Jewish people had to go through during the second world war. The ""Woman In Gold"" had became a icon of the Austrian culture and the government reluctant to let it go.

Enjoyable good film about a serious subject but with many faults.,"Woman In Gold - what a great tale from which to make a film. It would be hard to go wrong wouldn't it. And, they did it well. The result is a crowd-pleaser and although it has it's faults, overall you have to say that it is an enjoyable film. I'm not going to talk about the story because it is well known and most of the other reviewers have dwelt upon that. The film does the story well. So instead, I'm going to dwell on the issues that have separated this overall enjoyable film from what it might have been - a great film.The choice of Mirren in the lead role. She is a reasonable actor but you cannot see her without seeing the Queen! She always looks like Helen Mirren made up to look like the person she is playing rather than being able to ""be"" that person. This adds a layer of shallowness immediately.The choice of lightweight Ryan Reynolds as the lawyer is a mystery. He only adds to the shallowness. There are so many great actors working as waiters in restaurants yet we have to put up with this lightweight. Why for goodness sake? Perhaps he is popular in the US. The name Weinstein in the production credits says everything (and means it will probably get an Oscar).Of the three lead actors, Daniel Brühl shines above Reynolds and Mirren and gives some much-needed weight. A different league.The real star is the picture itself - Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer by Gustav Klimt - 1907. Stunning and imprinted on the mind of all who have seen it and well photographed in this film.The use of Ross Emery as DP was another odd choice as his career is based around car-chase films and films like Wolverine and The Matrix. It showed. Oh how Dick Pope or any number of other good DPs could have improved on the visuals.As with so many films made for the US market, you constantly felt that your emotions were being toyed with. Little set pieces with false jeopardy, everyone applauding when the goodies win. Pass me the sick-bag someone. And a glossy sheen painted over everything and all ends happily ever after. A bit like eating sugar-coated chocolates - superficially satisfying but very soon sickening. Still, that's how our US cousins seem to like it.Despite all these criticisms, I really enjoyed this film in a sugary way. Full marks must go BBC Films who on a small budget have a knack of picking the right films to be involved with.I guess it will be on TV in a while and it will not loose much from being in a smaller screen.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Fails to stir any deep emotions,"During World War II, the Nazis plundered an estimated 750,000 artworks from European countries including priceless paintings by Van Gogh, Degas, Vermeer, and Michelangelo. Though many paintings and other significant cultural artifacts were recovered by the ""Monuments Men,"" many were destroyed or auctioned off at extremely low prices. Today, there are well over 100,000 items that have not been returned to their rightful owners. In Woman in Gold, British director Simon Curtis (""My Week With Marilyn"") explores the fate of one of the paintings, the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I by Austrian symbolist painter Gustav Klimt, which was seized by the Nazis from its owner, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer.The painting, an oil and gold on canvas, ended up in Vienna's Belvedere Palace and became a popular tourist attraction, referred to as Austria's ""Mona Lisa."" Sadly, its original title denoting its Jewish heritage was replaced with the generic ""Woman in Gold."" Based on a true story, the film depicts the seven-year legal fight of Adele Bloch-Bauer's niece, Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren, ""Hitchcock""), a Jewish refugee and Los Angeles shop keeper, to reclaim her family's collection of Klimt paintings from the Austrian government. To assist her in her fight, Maria is helped by a friend's son, Randol Schoenberg (a bland and miscast Ryan Reynolds, ""The Captive""), grandson of composer Arnold Schoenberg.Schoenberg has just started working for a big law firm and has no experience in the world of art collection, but Maria is confident in his ability to persuade the Austrian authorities to return the painting, whose worth was estimated at $135 million dollars. After overcoming her reluctance to return to the country in which her family perished, Maria and her young attorney (with apologizes to his pregnant wife, Pam (Katie Holmes, ""The Giver""), travel to Vienna where flashbacks to Maria's life as a little girl (Tatiana Maslany, ""The Vow"") in a comfortable middle-class home provide a background for the painting's creation.Distressing scenes of the Anschluss in Austria in 1938 are shown where Nazi soldiers are greeted by cheering crowds and Maria witnesses the humiliation of Jews forced to clean sidewalks and have their facial hair removed. In a tense sequence, Maria and her husband Fritz's (Max Irons, ""The Host"") narrowly escape pursuing German officers in their attempt to leave Austria and fly to Cologne, then to London. Back in present time, Maria and Randol are assisted by Austrian investigative journalist Hubertus Czernin (Daniel Brühl, ""A Most Wanted Man""), as they try to convince a newly formed committee on art reclamation that the stolen Klimt paintings are rightfully and legally hers.In her will, Adele, who died at an early age, asked her husband to leave the paintings to the Austrian State Gallery upon her death, but whether or not this is legally binding is a key subject in the case. Eventually the case will end up in the U.S. Supreme Court in a rare instance of a U.S. citizen suing a foreign government. Woman in Gold tackles a great many weighty themes such as Austria's unwillingness to confront their World War II collaboration with the Nazis and the lurking rise of anti-Semitism in Europe, shown in a confrontation with a passerby who tells them that ""Not everything is about the Holocaust."" Unfortunately, however, the film takes on too much and lacks a clear focus. Characters are presented in broad strokes that fail to do justice to their humanity, depicting them more as symbols for a cause than as real human beings. Though Schoenberg discovers a connection with his grandfather, the famed twelve-tone composer that he never knew, the matter is barely touched on. Woman in Gold is to be commended for its attempt to increase awareness of a little known aspect of the Nazi atrocity, yet with its tepid direction and over reliance on sentimentality and clichés, it fails to truly stir any deep emotions.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I give it a Bronze!,"The true-story based drama ""Woman in Gold"" did not deserve any gold medals, but was bronzely deserved as solid cinematic offering. Helen Mirren stars as Maria Altmann, an older woman who was a Jewish refugee in her homeland of Austria. Her aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer sang the original version of Adele's ""Hello""; not even Lionel Richie sang it better! Hello! Hello! Are you still there? Please don't say goodbye yet to my review of ""Woman in Gold"". In all seriousness, Adele Bloch- Bauer was the subject of an infamous painting during the 1940's. However, that painting and much artwork of Maria's family was seized by the Nazis in Germany-occupied Austria. During the late 1990's after a few occurrences including a deep letter from her deceased aunt Adele, Maria decides that it's time to get what is rightfully hers; most notably the startling ""Woman in Gold"" painting, in that time displayed in an Austrian museum. So Maria hires a nice young Jewish lawyer named Randy Schoenberg, and their fight for art-recovery justice is in full plight as they tackle many obstacles, most notably the Austrian government, to recover to Maria what is rightfully hers. Director Simon Curtis does hold par in his orchestration of the picture, even though Simon says way too many times what is obvious. Alexi Kaye Campbell's screenplay was moderate at best, but shined brightly within Maria's charismatic dialogue. Helen Mirren did shine with a golden performance as Maria, and Ryan Reynolds deserved a silver-thespian medal with his work as Randy Schoenberg.

Hint: this is not Perry Mason and this is not Suits,"""Something happened out there and I just can't let it go."" (dialog, Reynolds)The negative reviews for Woman In Gold seem to be from reviewers expecting a cross between Witness for The Prosecution and Jurassic World.That is not what this movie is about.While based on a real story about a WW2 survivor who tried to reclaim a stolen painting from the Austrian government (a govt stuck in full-on ""stonewall"" mode) the producers clearly chose to use the tale as a metaphor for a much larger story about some of the worst aspects of human nature, to wit: doing nothing while everyone around you is committing the most evil acts and, later on, attempting to profit from your own inactivity.In this light, the alleged ""flaws"" of ""sentimental flashbacks"" and other criticisms melt like butter on a hot day.Reynolds is not bad, especially for a young actor who may be trying to put roles like ""Green Lantern"" behind him. A few more performances like this and he could actually do it.Mirren is nothing short of extraordinary. Incredible. There are points in the film where the script fails, or the direction fails, or something fails, and you can almost see her reach over to pick up the entire film and place it on her shoulders, and then carry it stoically to the the next scene.Extraordinary actress.

"Terrific Performances, Mediocre Story,","Woman in Gold is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast. It's certainly an enjoyable movie and the highlight for me is without a doubt Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds, they're an unlikely pair to put together, but they both shine in their roles and are the most powerful part of this film. The writing was a bit poor, the set up for this story seemed very interesting and I think it easily could have been an Oscar contender if it wasn't for the way the narrative was told, I felt like it wasn't taking these events seriously enough, for a movie in which the holocaust is an important subject, you would expect it to be much more dramatic and not so light hearted. The film needed more tension, there isn't enough times where we feel a real sense of worry and loss from these characters, they seem to get their way very often and there is never really a time where all hope is lost, where we feel like they're never going to achieve their goal, this is normally evident in movies and when it is absent it makes the ending a lot loss fulfilling. Woman in Gold may have several imperfections, but what it lacks in story it makes up for with terrific acting, certainly worth the watch if you ever see it on television or Netflix and are looking for a drama.A Jewish refugee works with a young lawyer in order to retrieve artwork she believes belongs to her.Best Performance: Helen Mirren",7.0,Anonymous,History

Apart from a solid performance by Helen Mirren, there is nothing else that resounds in this film. I particularly did not find saving grace in her chemistry with Ryan Reynolds, as the screenplay forces a mother & son relationship that I found out of place. The latter's acting was inconsistent as he awkwardly breaks out of character in emotionally driven scenes. As for the plot, the flashbacks were a bit of a wash as it forces melodrama without it being emotionally investing in the first place. The use of color & script made sure of that. Even the ""climactic"" court room scenes had little energy and was ultimately, predictable.Overall, Woman in Gold suffers from poor filmmaking (particularly screenplay).

When the fairy tale ending comes, you feel robbed of realism but it is a real story so, we have to live with that embellished portrayal of Maria Altman memoir polished by Hollywood. But I still have my doubts on Ryan Reynolds's character, the most of the time jobless lawyer who defies financial conundrum and judicial barriers with relative ease for a so called novice, adequately supporting his family and life while being dedicated to a long and expensive endeavor he does not know will pay out.

It touched on family, history, art, right and wrong, love, humor, and most of all just being a stubborn sassy lady. I loved it. Well casted and well written. I had no idea this was a true story and what a story it was. A story I know Randy (played by Ryan Reynolds) will be telling his children for generations to come. I have seen (not in person of course) the beautiful painting of the Woman in Gold, and now to hear the story behind her. The fact she was real and not just a figment of an artists mind. A real, living breathing person just makes it so much better. What a beautiful story, well done.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Justice for the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer,"Woman in Gold, directed by Simon Curtis, is based on the true story of Jewish Holocaust survivor Maria Altmann as she fights nearly fifty years later to reclaim ownership of artwork that belonged to her family that was stolen by the Nazis during WWII. Helen Mirren turns in an outstanding portrayal of Maria in her later life; Tatiana Maslany does the same for Maria's years as a young woman fleeing her hometown of Vienna, Austria, when the Nazi regime threatened the survival of the Jews there.One of the many art pieces stolen from the Altmanns is a stunning Masterpiece by Gustav Klimt; the painting was dubbed the ""Mona Lisa of Austria."" Stolen by the Nazis in 1941, it had been displayed for decades at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere.The original title of the piece, ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer,"" was of Maria's Aunt Adele who died of meningitis when she was forty-four. The portrait was one of two portraits of his wife commissioned of Klimt by Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer. By 1900, Klimt was the most popular portrait painter of the wives of the Jewish Viennese bourgeoisie.In 1998 Hubertus Czernin, an Austrian investigative journalist, (played by Daniel Brühl), established that the Österreichische Galeri Belvedere contained several works stolen from Jewish owners in the war. The gallery refused to return the art to their original owners, or even to acknowledge the crimes. Maria discovered some letters after her sister's death that linked her family to this Nazi art theft.Enter Ryan Reynolds who turned in an excellent performance as young lawyer E. Randol Schoenberg, the son of a family friend of Maria's. Randy's grandfather was renowned Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg and his grandfather's music was featured in the film.At first Randy is reluctant to take the job, but once he makes an exploratory fact-finding trip to Vienna, he is on board. Ryan Reynolds and Dame Mirren have a convincing chemistry in this mystery / buddy picture.Randy tells Maria that she will have to speak at a meeting of the Reunification Commission about the paintings. She too is reluctant, but naturally, her speech is very moving. ""When you look at this painting,"" she says, ""you see a work of art. I see my aunt.""With the aid of Czernin, they are able to maneuver the bureaucratic obstacles thrown their way and bat their game to the finish line.The narrative flips back and fourth from past to the time of the current story, a technique I like. I thought the acting was the strongest part of the movie and the script was slowed down by exposition. If you're interested in this important topic, or want to see Helen Mirren in a stellar performance, with impressive work form the cast, I recommend it.The way I came to the film was that I recently watched The Art Dealer, (L'Antiquaire), by filmmaker François Margolin, which also dealt with Nazi theft of Jewish artwork. I was keen to see more films on this topic.Last week I did a bit of genealogy research on the ancestry site Geni. com when I noticed a Jewish History project. One of the women featured in the project caught my eye because I know her and the photo that was up of her was not the correct person with that name. I found a photo of her, replaced the erroneous one, and shot the curator Randy Schoenberg a quick note to tell him what I did. He wrote back, ""Thank you.""Curious, I searched his name online and was led to a Wikipedia page about him. There I discovered that Randy Schoenberg is a U.S. attorney and genealogist, who specializes in legal cases related to the recovery of looted or stolen artworks, particularly those by the Nazi regime during the Holocaust.""Schoenberg,"" Wikipedia says, ""is widely known as one of the central figures of the 2015 film Woman in Gold, which depicted the case of Maria Altmann against the government of Austria. Schoenberg is portrayed by Ryan Reynolds.""Boom. I had my next film to watch. I also joined Randy's Jewish Genealogy group on Fb. This week, Randy mentioned a name of one of his ancestors that is the same name as one of my great-grandfathers. I asked a cousin if she thought we might be related, but she said no.I wanted to know what became of the ""Mona Lisa of Austria,"" so I looked it up and found this, ""In 2006, following eight years of effort by the Bloch-Bauer heirs, the painting was returned to the family; it was sold the same year for $135 million, at the time a record price for a painting. Since July 13, 2006, the painting has been on public display in the Neue Galerie in New York City.""Harvey Weinstein was a producer of this film and I felt loathe to see it because of the connection with him.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Honors Those Who Went Before,"This movie powerfully portrays the importance of honoring our heritage. Woman in Gold gives voice to our ancestors. It shows that to the degree that we remember our roots and live in a way to honor our ancestors, then a link divine is forged which impacts us here and now and and sweetens the inevitable reunion on the other side. Remembering, simply remembering our fore-bearers creates an inheritance that exceeds gold.Deuteronomy 6:10-12 serves as a good summary of this movie:*Then it shall come about when the LORD your God brings you into the land which He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you, great and splendid cities which you did not build, and houses full of all good things which you did not fill, and hewn cisterns which you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant, and you eat and are satisfied, then watch yourself, that you do not forget...*",10.0,Anonymous,History
Well Told and Suspenseful,"This is based upon a true story.Maria Altman (Helen Mirren) tries to get the painting - Woman in Gold- of her aunt Adele who was painted by Gustav Klimt back from the Austrian government. This painting, among others, was stolen by the Nazis and later ended up in Austria where the government treated the painting like ""their Mona Lisa"" and do not want to give it up. Maria hires Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) to be her lawyer.I really didn't think this would be any good for me, but since there were no other action-hero movies (are you waiting for the Superman/Batman movie?) out there I indulged. When I first saw the painting - Woman in Gold - my breath left me and I was hooked. What a beautiful painting (ha, you just liked the gold).There are 2-stories in here. One in the present as we see Maria and Randy do everything they can to retrieve the painting including going to the U.S. Supreme Court and we also see flashbacks to the time Maria lived in Austria, where we see interactions with her aunt Adele (Antje Traue), her family, her wedding, the time the Nazis came in and took everything to her escape from the Nazis. Even though we know Maria escapes, we felt the tension and urgency as the Nazis chased her through the streets of Vienna. Whew! I was out of breath too. Good job.Both stories are extremely well done and suspenseful throughout as we are not sure what will happen next. We see Nazi cruelty and some scenes were hard to watch and then we see Maria and Randy continue to find legal loopholes to convince the Austrian government to return the paintings to Maria. We see that Maria wanted to give up the fight many times but Randy who had given up his job at a successful law firm knew he had to persevere as he was laying everything on the line.(so the Queen got her painting back?) The Queen wasn't in this. (look she was, just because she dyed her hair she didn't fool anyone. It was the Queen) No, it was Helen Mirren. (that woman again?)Listening to the legal arguments on both sides was an education in itself. The acting all around was excellent.Notables: Katie Holmes as Pam, Randy's wife; Tatiana Maslany as the young adult Maria in Vienna; and Daniel Bruhl as Hubertus Czernin a journalist who helps Maria and Randy with local knowledge of the inner-workings of the Austrian government and of some officials.There is a resolution at the end of the movie, but stay before the credits run to learn more about what happened to Maria and Randy.

Gold plated,This is an incredibly moving tale well told in 'real-time' like documentary style stitched together with vignettes of the past remembered in full German language (subtitled) Technicolour. Overall there is a genuine feel for the truth of this story - as it is a real story. Even though some of the processes gone through to reach the final conclusion are simplified for film they nevertheless convey the size of the difficulties faced by Mrs Altmann and the prejudice and contempt she faced up to. The film also manages to convey a true feeling of survivor remorse as Mrs Altmann revisits her memories of the past. Mirren excels at this character acting and succeeds in embodying Mrs Altmann even though at first we recall her as Queen Elizabeth II. Definitely recommend to anyone with a good sense of history.,8.0,Anonymous,History
Mirren is headed the way of Maggie Smith,"This Mirren vehicle was a crowd pleasing time-passer not overly concerned with historical accuracy when compared to lavish ""production values"" that always make the filmmaker and studio much more money, as they know viewers will always choose entertainment value over factual history(so booooring!). Everyone know what ""dumbed down"" means? Also, Mirren is getting typecast in her recent ""queenly"" roles just as Maggie Smith has been firmly typecast in her old lady, snipey zinger slinger-roles of late in Downton and Marigold Hotel. A profitable trend for both of them no doubt, but it only adds to their bank accounts, not to their list of great roles.Lovely and stately Vienna, one of the world's greatest cities, was at its stunning best here, along with its many dramatically regal rooms that were used for virtually every scene filmed there. The story is of of a Mrs. Altmann, now a clothes retailer resident of L.A., but late of a wealthy Viennese, Jewish family, many of whom where killed later in WWII concentration camps, and how she escaped Nazi rule as her family's treasured art did not. All were stolen by the Nazis and reside in a Vienna museum that will not let them be reclaimed by the original owners.Getting that art returned to her was her life's passion and she almost never gave up that pursuit, and did need tremendous support along the way from her attorney to achieve it. The Altmann family's famous, Woman in Gold painting was the center of this eponymous story's attention due to its great artistic merit and vast monetary value. (Why and how there should EVER be any question at all about the righteous retrieval of those stolen paintings back to their legal owners is well beyond my understanding and conscience).The often humorous but sometimes harsh interplay between Mrs. Altmann and her young attorney, who zealously worked his backside off to get for her the fair and legal return of her treasures against the absolute denial of that wish by the museum's Nazi-like officer, was the story's main ""grab"".The story was not always right on point but it always interesting, most always engaging, with the end result mostly justifying our time in watching it. Now, go read the actual history online to know the entire story, and even though it has more or less the same ending as the movie does, it is well worth anyone's time who is as interested in the factual events of important global history as in what movies do with it to entertain us. Monument's Men is another one even more interesting...the real story, not so much the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,History

A to be remembered movie,"I have just returned from watching the movie ""Woman in Gold"" with my friend and both of us really enjoyed this excellent movie which I can highly recommend as well worth watching. All the actors played their parts well. Helen Mirren as Maria Altmann, an Austrian Jewish survivor who tries to recover her family's art works,and Ryan Reynolds who plays Randal Schoenberg, her lawyer, were the main actors and did a fine job with many moving moments. I won't go into the story much as the other reviews have all gone over it many times. However, I liked the fact that the story is based on the true life experience of an Austrian woman fighting for justice, restitution,and struggling to find peace from the torment of her past. The movie shows how at times she tries to escape the fight as she is tired and getting older but is spurred on by her able and motivated lawyer. She and her young lawyer struggle against all odds and though at first Randal is not emotionally involved he soon becomes so while visiting Austria and seeing the reality of his own ancestors. Tatiana Maslany who plays the young Maria portrays well Maria's heart wrenching escape from the Nazis in Austria and the separation from her beloved family. The flashbacks are done well and give further substance to the movie. There were some moments of humour to lift the mood of the spectator. After the movie was finished we sat in silence for a while and my friend shed a few tears. It left us thoughtful and moved.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Fascinating Case--Movie a Bit Bland,"I have to say that I enjoyed this film, but mostly for the subject matter, a court case that took place in 1998. We have for some time been made aware again of the Nazi's efforts to steal the great art of the world, particularly Western art. Movies like ""The Monument Men"" depict efforts to recover what they stole from the heart of the world. For this they can never be forgiven. The majority of these pieces have never been found. Fortunately, many of the works were kept in museums or in private residences and so were intact. This is the story of a piece that became known as the Austrian Mona Lisa. Helen Mirren is Maria Altman whose family owned the great portrait known as the Woman in Gold. When she finds some letters that tell of the story of the painting, she enlists a young Randy Schoenberg, the grandson of the great composer, to make a case for the return of the painting to its rightful heirs. Predictably, they wade through all the roadblocks, assisted by a young Austrian journalist. I have to agree with the reviews that talk about the good guys and the bad guys. I love Austria, especially Vienna, but here they are portrayed so harshly that we have little sympathy for their position. Ryan Reynolds is a little short on effort here, sort of phoning it in. But there are enough twists and turns and Mirren is great fun to watch to make it well worthwhile. I plan on seeing how realistic the portrayal was.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The viewer must decide for themselves whether the final result was really the best outcome.Helen Mirren seems somewhat miscast as the Jewish descendant seeking the return of her family portrait.

Of course the acting is great, who doesn't love Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds was a super huge surprise as well as Daniel Bruhl, but it is the story that captivates. As beautifully done as the painting is, the movie also takes you on a beautiful, sometimes intense, haunting ride through a very painful part of history. Going back and forth between the contemporary age where Maria Altmann is trying to recover what is rightfully hers to the past when the painting was stolen you gain an understanding of the pain and fear of the time.

Oscar-worthy Mirren steals the show,"Woman in Gold, beautifully written and acted with gripping performances from Ryan Reynolds and Daniel Brühl alongside memorable cameos from Elizabeth McGovern and Moritz Bleibtreu, deserves several Oscar- nominations. Helen Mirren delivers a tour-de-force performance and the entire film mirrors high production standards, excellent continuity and obviously skillful direction from Simon Curtis along with a wonderful musical score.Those pundits here and on other sites panning this little gem because they are either anti-Semitic or think that money and lawyers getting rich was the only motive for this real-life story have missed the point entirely and should probably stick to watching mindless shlock like Jurassic World instead of something tender and lovingly crafted dealing with a difficult but nevertheless touching story told with a warmth, obvious love and pride of craftsmanship that is not often found in many films these days.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Touching and emotional but seemingly bland,"Woman in Gold is one woman's story and perseverance to reclaim the possessions stolen from her family by the Nazi regime nearly sixty years earlier.Elderly Maria Altmann, played by Helen Mirren, must return to her home city of Vienna and wage in battle against the Austrian government for one of its most prized national treasures, Gustave Klimt's ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I."" Fighting for restitution in a battle that means near certain defeat, she and lawyer Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) engage in a lengthy legal battle to recover the painting to its rightful owner.A film as much in the past as it is in the present, Woman in Gold perfectly conveys the open wounds left by living through such an atrocity as Nazi persecution. Told through seamless flashbacks to the era and rise of the Third Reich in Austria during World War II, there are two stories being told in the film. The first being the fight of Maria and Randy for the return of her family's heirlooms and the story of outrageous crimes her elders faced.In the moments when the Nazis are ravaging the homes of Jewish families, a hatred and anxiety will bubble up from within you at the injustice and hopelessness of the events. The blind hostilities that led to near eradication of so many families' histories and how unremarkable Altmann's experience is only fuels the emotional connection the audience has with the narrative.The judicial happenings are well paced and a lull never occurs, nor does any part of it feel unnecessarily sensationalized for cinematic effect, and the performances are powerful and realistic. While sad, uplifting and historically informative, there is a part of Woman in Gold that feels blandly disjointed. Perhaps it is the lack of creative mark on the drama that leads it to feeling average and not miraculous.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",7.0,Anonymous,History

About half the movie contains flashbacks, which is a method that's way too far overused now, and it's completely overused here.

Mirren was quite good as the tetchy, elderly woman who discovers that she might have a chance to undo an historic wrong. I was less impressed at Ryan Reynold's underdogish E. Randol Schoenberg. I don't recall any scene in the film in which the heroic lawyer's potential fee is discussed (but at 40% contingency, he made over $120 million dollars) and I'm not sure what would have happened if Altmann had decided not to sell the paintings. While, at least as I know the story, law and justice were on Altmann's side, I was still somewhat put off by the one-sidedness of the story: anyone who disagreed with Altmann or Schoenberg is presented as either a smarmy museum suit, a supercilious bureaucrat, or an anti-Semite.

More Colorless Than Outwardly Bad,"Woman in Gold is not a ""bad"" film, but it's much too safe to be remarkable or memorable. Depending on your mood and expectations, you could be either bored or charmed by its calm nature, and either option would be accurate. The quiet sentimentalism gently and even pleasantly washes over you. In the end, though, its complete lack of challenge or surprise to its audience is yawn-inducing. Emotionally tidy and cinematically underwhelming, WiG is sorely lacking impact and color. This genericism stems from the setup: an overly-curious whipper- snapper (Reynolds) helps a fiery older woman (Mirren) correct the past. It's been done. However, with Mirren leading the show, grace and class always co-mingles with spirit and sharpness. Even Reynolds, whose forced facial expressions and line deliveries often negatively affect his performances, is refreshingly nondescript. Their characters, however, are complex-less, with arcs that feel more forced than fleshed out. More comic-relief and less overly serious pondering would help, but with the self-righteous score and incessant flashbacks, the core narrative is slowed to an expositional bore. The true story of these two misfits taking on the Austrian government is anything but lifeless. The incredible legal proceedings are interesting and fun, and it isn't hard to get roused up by the inherent injustice of the atrocities of WWII. Unfortunately, this complex true-life story is told in a decidedly un-complex fashion. If you don't see many movies, the overused tropes and storytelling tricks may work thanks to the good performances an amazing story. Otherwise, WiG will most likely just feel like a lifeless rehash, more bothered with bad Hollywood coincidences than reality.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"""Monuments Men"" done right","Set in the late 1990s, ""Woman in Gold"" is a true-life David-and- Goliath story about a headstrong elderly woman who, essentially, takes on an entire nation in her pursuit of justice.The woman is 82-year-old Maria Altmann, a native Austrian from a well-to-do Jewish family, who fled with her husband to America to escape Nazi persecution. Now that Maria, who currently resides in Pasadena, is nearing the end of her life, she's decided to try and get back some of the priceless artwork that was confiscated when the Nazis ransacked her family's home, pieces that now reside in various museums around Austria. Even though the country has ostensibly adopted a policy of ""restitution"" to the Jewish families whose artwork was stolen, the government is actually loath to relinquish its hold on the pieces, which it now considers to be national treasures. Maria, thus, turns to her friend's son, Randol Schoenberg, for help in getting back a series of paintings that once belonged to her family, in particular, one (unofficially referred to as the ""'Mona Lisa' of Austria""), a portrait of her beloved aunt who died at a young age in the 1920s. Because the identity of the woman in the painting was unknown for so long, the work became known in the art world as ""Woman in Gold.""Schoenberg is a neophyte attorney whose own grandfather perished in a concentration camp. Initially reluctant to become involved with this eccentric old woman and her seemingly hopeless case, Schoenberg, despite having little experience in restoration law, eventually relents and dedicates much of his waking life to seeing that the paintings - and especially ""Woman in Gold"" - are restored to their rightful owner.Written by Alexi Kaye Campbell and directed by Simon Curtis, ""Woman in Gold"" is a legal thriller and an historical drama centered around the burgeoning friendship between two vastly different individuals who likely would never have met or, at least, never connected emotionally under other circumstances. Together, this determined duo triumphs over one bureaucratic setback and one legal hurdle after another on their way to ultimate victory (the case even makes its all the way to the United States Supreme Court). Throughout, the screenplay regularly flashes back to Maria's harrowing experiences living under Nazi rule.In both format and style, ""Woman in Gold"" is a fairly conventional ""feel-good historical drama,"" a bit bland and risk-averse, and, as such, it misses the opportunity to really distinguish itself in a major way. But despite the temptation to view it through cynical eyes, I must say that it's awfully hard not to give ""Woman in Gold"" the benefit of the doubt, partly because the scenes set in the past can't help but be affecting, and partly because Mirren never falls into the trap of becoming the starch, brittle, cranky old-lady stereotype that a lesser actress might have had a much more difficult time avoiding. It's also nice to see Ryan Reynolds taking on a more challenging role than the ones he usually gets to play (his slightly nerdy appearance is an obvious attempt at downplaying his matinée-idol handsomeness and thus generating some gravitas for the character), but he feels slightly overmatched when put up against Mirren (as who wouldn't be?). He has some very good moments, no doubt, but a certain overall callowness in the performance limits its effectiveness and knocks the movie off-balance.""Woman in Gold"" explores some interesting themes, the most notable being whether a victim of something as incomprehensibly horrific as the Holocaust can ever really achieve any kind of peace in this life or whether the wounds simply run too deep to ever really heal. The outcome of Maria's quest provides one answer, while the lovely coda with which Campbell chooses to end his film seems to provide another.Incidentally, ""Woman in Gold"" might make an interesting double feature with ""The Monuments Men,"" a lesser movie that, nevertheless, deals with some of the same subject matter as ""Woman in Gold."" But the latter is the far richer film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The fight for the Mona Lisa of Austria.,"Based on the true story of an elderly woman, Maria Atman, who attempt to reclaim her aunt's portrait from the museum of her birthplace.

Only if it would have been a better narration, at least in a few important portions, the awards would have been poured on it rather just praises. Anyhow Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds combo were excellent, but individually she ruled and he was a low key performance. Though the overall movie wins with the inspiring characters than the narration.The two different timeline stories edited into one random presentation. One is the past events and the other is the present that reveals simultaneously Maria's struggles. Really, it was better than I thought, one of the best drama with the backdrop of the world war 2. Everyone can't enjoy this flick, but certainly I feel I want to recommend it all.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
A story that needed to be tole,"I have been looking forward to this movie because of the story and the art. I have always liked the Woman in Gold - I have done needlework that also represents his style. This movie is quietly told - no yelling, no fights, just legal arguments about why the artwork belonged to Maria Altman. I liked the way the flashbacks were presented throughout the whole movie - I felt her pain in those memories. I have read negative reviews of Ryan Reynolds performance and disagree with them. He portrays a lawyer with no practice who learns more about himself as this case goes on and on, and it leads him to the supreme court and back to Vienna. I appreciated the quietness of this film - I think it is a movie that should be shown to teenagers, and watched by those of us who know the backdrop of this story. It is a fact of history but the story of what happened to families is so important to not be forgotten. Well done.",8.0,Anonymous,History
compelling story,"Maria Altman (Helen Mirren) loses her sister Luise and is left to take care of the family legacy. Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) is a struggling lawyer heavily in debt after a failed upstart. They are both from famous Vienna families and share losses to the Nazis. He reluctantly meets Maria as a favor to his mother. Maria had lost many in her family and most of their possessions. The most prominent is a picture of her aunt painted by Klimt worth over $100 million.This is a compelling story with Helen Mirren going great work once again. I love that neither leads are that driven to get restitution. She's reluctant to go back to Austria and he's in it more for the money in the beginning. They are true underdogs. Tatiana Maslany is also impressive as the younger Maria. Ryan Reynolds is a little flat at the beginning and he shouldn't joke around in the later sections. He may not be a great fit for the character. The story is very compelling and intriguing. There are usually differences from the real story. The only one that irked me a little is the discussion of money. In the beginning, Maria claims she's not selling the painting making it more of a principle of justice. In the end, she obviously sold some of the paintings. I don't have a problem with selling but the film shouldn't suggest that it's not about the money.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Because no crime is too small,"I love art & even though, it isn't a masterpiece like the titular painting, it's still a good movie. The only drawbacks are that the movie is 15 minutes too long & a bit overtly sentimental (but that you can excuse, considering the subject matter).Now the good stuff:
1. The initial scene which shows Klimt painting the 'Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer'. The whole thing is so good: the intriguing painting technique, the consummate painter, the luminous model, the necklace, the ambience, the light, the music, etc. For just a little while, this scene transported me into the room like an eavesdropper & made me feel like great art was being made right before my own eyes.2. The background music, the beautiful photography, the perfect sets & the sensitive portrayals by all the actors involved.3. The bonding scenes between Altmann & her lawyer.4. The scene when the lawyer breaks down upon his visit to the holocaust memorial & the one where he confesses brokenly to his wife that he only went for the money.5. The scene where Altmann says that when people see the painting, they see the work of a great painter but she sees her aunt.6. The holocaust had devastating consequences, especially for the jews. So, even though it's based on real life events, I was intrigued to see how this movie in particular, which was based on far less sinister aspects of holocaust (that of the theft of personal belongings), was going to appeal to the audiences at large. However, this movie very effectively made me realize that no crime is too small. Theft is theft; be it of life, liberty, identity, dignity or of the numerous other things that we may hold dear.For these, and many other good things, I liked the movie a lot!",8.0,Anonymous,History

They story line was well laid out and kept me very invested through the entire movie, and I was surprised at how involved Ryan Reynolds becomes personally involved in the adventure.

Solid Dramatic Biopic Worth your Time,"""When people see the famous portrait, they see a masterpiece by one of Austria's finest artists. But I see a picture of my aunt, a woman who talked to me about life while I brushed her hair in her bedroom."" Truer and more earnest words could not have been spoken better than that of Austrian- Jewish holocaust survivor, Maria Altmann, known for successfully reclaiming some of her family paintings from the Austrian Government that were abducted by the Nazis. Today's film tackles that subject, and upon viewing it for the first time, it managed to speak above higher levels of sincerity and personal attachment that I don't see often in cinema.The first notable element that the film portrays beautifully is the character of Maria Altmann herself. Growing up as a child in the mid-20s, she saw her aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer being used to create the grim yet beauteous woman in the portrait known as Woman in Gold. Adele had a few portraits made of her by Austrian symbolist painter Gustav Klimt at age 25 through negotiations by her husband. Considering how much the portrait of her aunt meant to Maria personally, it makes sense that she would feel disgusted to see how this painting was used in later years. In fact, throughout the film, we see flashbacks of Maria's childhood that perfectly immolates her lifespan from childhood to young adulthood.Given how close Maria felt to her aunt as elegantly displayed in these flashbacks, this makes the symbolism of the gold painting all the more powerful. Klimt's intention was to showcase a ""swirling gown within a blaze of gold rectangles, spirals and Egyptian symbols"", creating her aunt as the personification of Vienna's Golden Age. After her aunt died, the family would look upon the paintings through divineness, leaving Maria only with memories of the paintings, before they were taken away. This is what presents the ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"" as a symbol of all that her family had lost.One aspect that the film never shies away from is the horrible treatment of European Jews. As mentioned before, the film often depicts flashbacks of Maria's struggles in Austria. Not just the treatment of ""inferior"" people, but by also demonstrating Nazis taking family possessions away from their original owners and would never have them restored. Maria's story compliments this unfortunate event, but the idea that it's best to let go of the past plays a notable contrast, despite how unjustified the act was. Sure, those who may not have been affected by it could still feel sorry for such a tragedy, but the ones who had a piece of them taken away by their foes just adds into how much of a double-edged sword the justice behind this act really is.Adding on to the well personified protagonist, the acting is also spot on. Helen Mirren is able to showcase the guilt hidden in Maria from how she abandoned her family to live a safer life, and is excellent at presenting her conflicted soul. She perfectly understood how Maria was tangled up between the past and the need to move on, elevated with tough emotions. Ryan Reynolds may be praised for Deadpool nowadays, but he is able to personify lawyer Randy Schoenburg (grandson of composer Arnold Schoeburg) as a young persistent lawyer extraordinarily. As a struggling family man with strong conviction for his roots, Reynolds leaps his persona to whole new heights as a determined lawyer in getting justice back to the right person.Similar to Big Eyes, the supporting cast either come off as obstacles or supporters in the protagonist's determination to gain their rightfully owned possessions back. Some like Hubertnus Czernin and Pam Schoenburg do support the duo in their court cases and battles against false copyright claims as well as giving some insight on their own pasts. Others, on the other hand, like Dr. Dreimann, Rudolph Wran, and those in favor of the Austrian government are highly intelligent and guarded civilians who have to deal with someone wanting back a possession which is also a legendary piece of their motherland. Not to mention, the court room scenes are at their most complex, especially in how Randy exercises in ownership loopholes and fighting against claims of the 1976 copyright act.Now the story itself does fall a little derivative with the two main leads conflicting with one another throughout before officially teaming up. Yet as overused as it seems, it actually helps give Randy a clear purpose to aid Maria given how much he cares about the identity of his own people as much as hers. Along with the gut-wrenching drama, the film occasionally sneaks in some subtle humor for good measure. Even if this was to keep the horrid trauma from what it truly was in real life, it gives off a more relatable vibe with the story and characters for the audience. Finally, the use of grim cinematography during the flashbacks fits perfectly with the time period to create the right sense of depression in contrast to the brighter cinematography of Altmann's court cases in '99.With sharp acting, well defined characters, and perfect contrast between the past and future, Woman in Gold is such remarkable insight on a fascinating woman who fought the law to gain her rightfully owned possessions back. The film actually ends with a quote that states, ""It has been estimated that over 100'000 works of art taken by the Nazis have not been returned to their rightful owners"". That quote only makes Maria's success all the more unique seeing as how much that piece meant to her, even if it meant taking a historic piece of art away from Austria. While some may not know of the actual history, this motion picture manages to stay true to the facts, and would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to see an underdog story about gaining one's memories back.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Good story, bad script","This movie could've been really very good if it were written by an adult. It's the same two dimensional characterization used to portray those on board ""Titanic"" - the movie, where a film maker thinks the story is strong enough to carry the whole project freeing them to write a melodrama.I am familiar with the work of Gustav Klimt, read the book 'Woman in Gold' and hoped, maybe too much, to see more of what I'd read than what has become a vehicle for the great Helen Mirren. I LOVE Helen Mirren. I know how hard she works to get inside a character but she didn't get inside this one. Also, the story just doesn't provide for a major character roll. There are just too many major characters in this oh so rife with Reich period in history. The result is too much fill - not good or believable dialog and a few good shots of Ryan Reynolds' abs (not really, he never shows his abs - which was surprising). I think Ryan Reynolds did a surprisingly good job and while also lacking the lines and direction that Mirren suffered, placed first in believability.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"""Woman in Gold""--A Glimmer of Retribution","The movie ""Woman In Gold"" is based on the remarkable story of the octogenarian Austrian- American woman, Maria Altmann (played by the always sensational Helen Mirren). Maria fights to reclaim the Gustav Klimt masterpiece of her aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer, a wealthy art collector of Klimt paintings. ""Portrait of the Jewess Adele"". More popularly known as ""The Woman in Gold"", this masterpiece was the Austrian equivalent of the ""Mona Lisa"".""Woman in Gold"" is appealing on several levels: as history, narrative, and as emotional gratification that retribution does happen sometimes.

A Fight to Reclaim Art Stolen by Nazis,"This movie brings together an unlikely cast of Helen Mirren, Ryan Reynolds and Daniel Bruhl in what I found to be a highly satisfying drama, based on a true story concerning a great work of art by painter Gustav Klimt from from early 20th century Venna. I have always admired Helen Mirren's acting and I knew about Klimt from an exhibit at the National Gallery in Ottawa, some 15 years ago. We learn the background through a series of flashbacks that play through Mirren's memory as Maria Altmann, the child of a highly cultured family in Vienna, who were targeted by the Nazis during the occupation of Austria in World War II. She lived through the Nazi reign of terror during which Jewish families were humiliated, their property stolen and eventually they were deported to death camps. (There is one highly-charged chase scene that took place on foot through streets, and dark passages that had me on the edge of my seat.) As an older woman living in Pasadena she becomes acquainted with a young lawyer who is also part of her extended family. Ryan Reynolds as Arnold Schoenberg is at first reluctant to take on a mission to recover a work of art; he is busy starting a career and family, when they meet. However, he becomes engrossed with Maria's sister ""The Woman in Gold"", one of Klimt's paintings and soon becomes the catalyst keeping Mirren focused on her goal of getting some justice done. Daniel Bruhl, as a young Austrian journalist trying to erase the stain of Austria's flirtation with the Nazis, is their chief contact in the fight against a few arrogant elitists who seem to have learned nothing from their country's history. All told, it was a great movie--entertaining and tragic both but lightened by touches of humour and an alliance among three different people trying to deal with the evils of the past.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Truly inspirational.,"In this film Helen Mirren plays Maria Altmann, an Austrian-American refugee during the WWII. The film tries to capture how hard was for this people to live during the era. We know that there are things that money can't buy, things that are full with sentiments and memories that we find hard to be separate to them. It appears that in Maria's case her family paintings, were that thing. I've always loved Hans Zimmer soundtracks, his music makes you feel the films on a much deeper way, in this case he joins Martin Phipps to create a very good soundtrack for this film. Films based on true events makes films to remember, but in order to truly enjoy this film, you must turn on the empathy switch and let yourself feel the pain of being forced to leave the things you love the most behind.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good story to tell but not to show,"This is a great story that fails big on the big screen. The two main characters have a great deal of personal history and conflicts that I should care a great deal for them except that I didn't when watching. There is not a moment of impact that can move me. Ryan Reynolds made me tired, he wore one face and one expression throughout the movie, so whenever not seeing him was some relieved moments though rare. And Helen Mirren was too wise, too snickering, too often for her own sake, she undermines whatever suffering she wants me to feel. There were many characters just happen to be there to fill the gaps, they made no sense whatsoever including his kid and his wife, the movie barreled through them like a big tractor down the freeway and left them no trace. Meaning: I don't really care for any.I was happy to see Tom Schilling in the tiny role of the watching Nazi officer, he did light up the screen in this dull affair, why not using this magnificent actor for the main role I wonder. Suggestion: Go watch him in A Coffee in Berlin and see your life worth living at least for two hours than this American made trash.Woman in Gold tried mighty hard to pull audience through and beyond the canvas but it could not.

Wonderful,"What a beautiful movie. Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds did such a good job that we forgot we were watching a movie. The story was based on fact, the paintings were real and atrocious act of taking people's belongings and lives by the Nazi's was very real. The supporting cast was wonderful, young Maria looked like she and Mirren are related. The slipping back and forth added such realism to the film. It was joyous and horrible at the same time. Despite the subject matter this was a very uplifting film.My only complaint isn't with the movie, but I should think it would be a concern to the producers of films that have subtitles (the film uses them for dialogue while in Austria). I do not understand the use of white letters of text upon a light background making reading of the dialogue so difficult. It may show up better on a large screen but it should be changed now that most people watch films at home. I am hearing impaired and use closed captioning, white letters in a black box.

Justice is a masterpiece,"The movie - based on a true story - is about a woman named Maria Altman - played by Academy Award winner Helen Mirren - whose painting of her aunt was taken by the Nazis in World War II. She hires Randy Schoenberg (Golden Globe Nominee Ryan Reynolds) to help in her battle. Not only was this a battle for what belonged in her family for centuries, but it was a crusade for justice of yet another crime perpetrated by the Nazis.While this got mixed reviews from the critics, I personally thought that this was a beautiful movie that was elevated by the performance from its two leads. Helen Mirren is always a sight to behold in each of her movies and her performance here brings a sort of history to the movie, as we are reminded once again of the crimes that the Nazis have done (and I'm not just talking about the artwork). Ryan Reynolds is always fun to watch, but here he downplays the comedic persona for something a little more serious and it surprisingly fit him like a glove! Even in some of his more serious movies, he had a bit of comedic charm to him, so it was nice to see him go way more dramatic in this role. The supporting actors are all good as well. Katie Holmes did a good job as the wife that Reynolds is supporting (thus being a big reason as to why he's taking on the case), Golden Globe Nominee Daniel Bruhl is always a talented actor no matter what he does, and Golden Globe Nominee Tatiana Maslany does a great job in portraying a younger version of Helen Mirren.Overall, go and see this movie!

One of the best movies I have ever watched,"What an amazing movie. I had guessed that it would be a good movie, but it was done almost perfectly... I can't recall a single flaw or change I thought should be made, not that I'm anybody special but we all have our opinions. I guess there had to be some flaw but I sure missed it.I knew that the cast could act but their performances were exactly right. I've always liked Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds but they outdo themselves. The supporting cast was just as good. Every role was flawless... and the only way that can happen, even with an extraordinary cast, is to have a master directer. I had never heard of Simon Curtis but he is on my radar now. It wasn't slow, it wasn't rushed, the characters neither overacted or underplayed their roles... not once. Everything... and I mean everything, was just right, start to finish.For goodness sake, this is a movie about a bloody painting I never heard of before, which I went to because I had time on my hands. I would have been happy with... OK. Instead, I was treated to something special, a rare jewel. Curtis made me care about every scene in the movie... not in a soppy way, but in whatever way he wanted... happy, sad, curious... I was only too happy to be guided through this story. Frankly, I was completely manipulated and I thank him for it.I am really trying to describe the heart of this movie... the thing at the centre of every scene but I just don't have the words. It would take somebody more clever than I to properly do justice to it. Sculptors have described their art as taking away everything that isn't the subject. That's what happened here. Curtis managed to show us the essence of every scene. He added nothing that wasn't necessary and everything that was. When it was over, it didn't leave you wanting more... which may not sound like a compliment, but it is. When you left, you knew there was nothing left to tell. Nothing could be added to the movie which could have made it better...

A brilliant telling of the harrowing true story of the Klimt painting,"This is one of the best-crafted cinematic accounts of a true story which I have seen. Director Simon Curtis proved earlier that he was a brilliant director with his MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011, see my review), and here he outdoes himself. He chose the perfect, and possibly the only, actress to portray Maria Altmann, whose heroic story of loss and retrieval this is. Helen Mirren is a famous British actress who is not entirely British. Her real name is Mironoff, because her father was a Russian exile. She therefore knows more about how to be a convincing foreigner than most actresses. The film is really the story of Gustav Klimt's famous portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, which is covered in gold leaf and is a work of art of the kind today described by the term 'iconic' (in this case, considering that the gold leaf somewhat resembles the solid gold riza of a sacred Russian icon, the term 'iconic' is for once less a product of trendy terminological innovation than an accurate description). Adele Bloch-Bauer was the aunt of Maria Altmann. They were a rich Jewish family in Vienna. Maria, her husband, and her sister fled Austria to escape the Nazis, and narrowly succeeded in reaching the safety of America, where they lived for the rest of their lives. The film shows both contemporary events and the events of the Viennese story, interweaved as Maria's memories. The film is well constructed, with an excellent screenplay by Alexi Kaye Campbell (his first), who had the active assistance of E. Randol Schoenberg (Arnold Schoenberg's grandson and also a refugee from Vienna) whose friendship with and assistance of Maria gives us the other major character in the story. Schoenberg is wonderfully played by Ryan Reynolds. The Nazis seized all of the possessions of Maria's family including a Holbein and five Klimt paintings, of which the famous portrait was the main one. The five Klimts ended by a devious and circuitous route in a Viennese art museum, where the portrait became 'iconic' for the entire Austrian people, and was even considered to represent 'the heart of the Austrian people'. Nothing could be more ironic than that, since the painting was of a Jewess, and no people anywhere in Europe welcomed Hitler with more enthusiasm and persecuted their Jews with greater energy and glee than the Austrians. I have often heard it said that Austria is still the most anti-Semitic country in the Western world. When Hitler entered Vienna in the Anschluss, there were delirious crowds shouting with joy lining all the streets, waving swastikas and practically fainting with joy. Hitler himself was an Austrian, not a German, it should be remembered, and his real surname was Schickelgrueber, as Hans Habe discovered when he got hold of a copy of Hitler's birth certificate and fled Austria with it in his possession, with the Gestapo hot on his heels; the Hitlers were the family of Hitler's mother, and they were a part-Jewish rustic Austrian country family. It has always seemed to me that Hitler's fanatical determination to annihilate the 'taint' of the Jews was really a psychological projection, and was an outward manifestation of his manic desire to extirpate the 'taint' of his own Jewish blood. By destroying the Jews, he may have wished to destroy the Jew within himself, such being his crazed reasoning. (Goebbels also appears to have been part-Jewish, and certainly looked it.) The film shows very well the outrageous corruption, conspiracy and hypocrisy of the modern Austrian officials who try every trick in the book to prevent Maria from using the restitution law to reclaim the Klimt paintings, despite the clear proof that they are hers by right as the last remaining direct heir of the original owners. Her struggle against all the odds over many years is portrayed in the most graphic detail, and with considerable dramatic effect, Helen Mirren is of course magnificent as Maria. The film is deeply moving, and also consists of an excellent exposé of the Austrian mindset which Maria faced. The film is a genuine saga, gripping, tragic, sad, but also in the end triumphant. This is what is called 'a very human story', but it portrays inhumanity very well also, and not just that of the 1940s. The tale is a perfect example of how hard one has to struggle for justice against all the corrupt forces which prevail everywhere. There is even a scene where Maria has to go to the American Supreme Court as part of her struggle. But it is always worth the effort, for by such struggles we affirm our refusal to accept evil, and we must always oppose it, at whatever cost to ourselves. But that cost is often so high. For there is no easy way to oppose evil, and it cannot be done from an armchair.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Brings reality to a strange historical episode,"Diane and I watched this superb film last night on CD; we both thought that it was meaningful and brought an interesting perspective on a situation that we knew about but had not seen it take shape as a film. This film brought substance to situations large and small that confront people on both sides of the political/social spectrum. Even the two of us living on the edge of the cultural world, have heard stories of the concern felt by people inhabiting dwellings throughout Western Europe who see cars moving slowly past their homes wondering if they lived in the home previously owned by Jews; the people in the car were their relatives and perhaps wanted it back. There are a huge number of stories that revolve around these circumstances, not just concerning houses but artefacts such as this movie define so well.This was a true story involving a very famous painting and the role played by Mirren and Reynolds was virtually perfect. Her role was enacted superbly in that she conveyed that anguish of not: wanting to return to Vienna, wishing to force an issue regarding the ownership of the painting and confronting old memories that had long-since been mentally buried.The script revolves around her attempt to access the painting and as such she is involved in myriad court cases in America as well as Austria. Reynolds is the lawyer that handles her case; the film also revolves around the legalism of her attempts to regain the picture. Therefore, the film has these two sides: the legal and the emotional/historic.I believe the Director did a marvellous job of taking the plot back to the original characters, as of 1938, when Anschluss joined Hitler's Germany to Austria. It was a very good technique in that the viewer could get some idea of the time period when all of this activity took place. Everything about this film is without error and extremely timely and therefore should be sought out and viewed.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"See the movie, then see the painting","Woman in Gold (2015), directed by Simon Curtis, is about a painting--Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer--a 1907 work by Gustav Klimt. The painting was owned by Austrian Jews, and it was immediately confiscated when Austria joined Germany and the Nazis gained control of the country.The beautiful painting was proudly displayed in Austria after World War II ended. The basic plot of this film is the attempt of an elderly descendant of the owners--Helen Mirren--to regain what was stolen from her family. In this quest she's aided by a young lawyer--Randol Schoenberg--and an Austrian journalist, played by Daniel Brühl.We know the painting was eventually recovered, so there's no actual suspense. However, that doesn't mean the movie isn't gripping and compelling. The Austrian government fought with every tool at its disposal to keep the painting, and the David & Goliath struggle must have truly looked hopeless at the time. (It's easy in retrospect to say, ""Of course she should and will get the painting."" But this battle was waged for seven years, and, while it was going on, there must have been more grim moments than happy ones.)The most poignant part of the movie isn't about the painting per se, but about the fate of Austrian and German Jews, who believed they were integrated into society, and were respected by all. This society turned upon them in an instant, and suddenly they were fleeing for their lives. Some of them escaped, but most didn't. The society and culture they loved suddenly had no use for them, and wanted them destroyed. Even those who survived physically must have been scarred forever psychologically.People say, ""You've seen the movie, now read he book."" Well, there is, indeed, a book, but what I really mean is, ""You've seen the movie. Now see the painting."" The Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer has pride of place in the Neue Galerie on New York's Upper East Side (near the Metropolitan Museum of Art.) We saw it, and it is indeed beautiful. People are lined up around the block to view the painting that was taking away forcibly, and taken back legally.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Of course, the most convenient thing to do from the beginning would have been to just laissez faire, that certainly would have saved Maria Altmann a lot of trouble, but then there would have been no story of justice, restitution, exoneration and in some ways rehabilitation of Austria; and the very turning point is when she acts against her own decision and goes back to Austria anyway, just to ""face the ghosts"". In that moment the victory was almost given with certainty from the beginning.Ryan Reynolds plays the hero, and Daniel Brühl makes an important part as their ally in Austria. Charles Dance also appears as one of his typical roles, and you will be surprised to find Elizabeth McGovern as the first vital female judge. There are some startling sequences as well of great suspense, and of course the entire holocaust inexhaustible complexity of problems. German is spoken on occasion to add to the realism, and the entire film is indispensable for its accuracy in realism and sticking to the truth. At the same time, it's a great tribute to art and its everlasting magic, importance and influence, whether you like the art of Gustav Klimt or not.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Absolutely Beautiful Movie,"""Woman in Gold"" is based on the true story of an elderly Jewish refugee Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren) who decides to try to recover a painting of her aunt (Portrait of Adele Block-Bauer also known as ""The Woman in Gold"")
In Vienna, just before World War II the portrait along with all the family's belongings was stolen out of Maria""s parents house by the Nazis.Now, after her sister's death, Maria discovers documentary proof that the painting of her aunt, is now in the possession of a state museum in Austria. The painting has become widely known through out the country as ""The Mona Lisa of Austria""
""When people see the famous portrait, they see a masterpiece by one of Austria's finest artist. But, I see a picture of my Aunt. A woman who talked to me about life, while I brushed her hair in her bedroom"" - Maria Altmann
With the help of a young lawyer, Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) Maria takes her legal battle to the Supreme Court of the United States and then to the Austrian government.The story is told through a series of flashbacks to when the Nazi invaded Vienna and the persecution of Jewish families. We see Maria's family, her wedding, she and her husband escape and flee to the United States. But they are forced to leave her parents behind and of course the beautiful portrait of her Aunt.This movie is just absolutely beautiful in every way. I really enjoyed every second of this true story. It is so well written and what an absolutely amazing cast! The flashbacks are shot in such a cinematic way that it captures the whole atmosphere of that past time and place.Helen Mirren is just amazing as Altman who refused to give up on her aunt's portrait... even after decades of injustice.Cast - Helen Mirren, Ryan Reynolds, Katie Holmes, Daniel Brühl, Jonathan Pryce, Elizabeth McGovern, Charles Dance

Great work!,"Helen Mirren, the film protagonist, proved that she is an exceptional actress. She truly served her role and her acting was so convincing it almost felt like you were watching scenes from your daily life. Ryan Reynolds also played very well and they both made a rather special but successful duet.As for the plot, it is very interesting, unpredictable and it addresses a very touching and modern historical fact. I assure those who hated history class back in school (me included) , it's nothing like that, but much better. It only has the captivating and educational aspect of it.Finally, the director, producers, costume designers etc also did a great job. So, in a nutshell, it is a movie I would definitely recommend to people who want to watch something of quality and wish to enjoy themselves.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Not all golden,"Woman in Gold stars Helen Mirren as Maria Altmann a Jewish Austrian who fled to America. The artist Gustav Klimt painted her aunt who later became known as Woman in Gold. The painting along with others had been confiscated by the Nazis and later went on display at an Austrian museum.After her sister dies in the late 1990s, Maria living in LA seeks the help of a young lawyer Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) whose family also fled Austria during the Jewish persecution to recover the paintings.Maria and Randol travel to Austria and discover the government and the museum are obstinate. As a journalist who befriends them (Daniel Bruhl) informs them that the authorities will put every hurdle in their path.When they return to America, Randol discovers that he could use a loophole to sue the museum in American soil and renews the legal battle.Woman in Gold is more than a courtroom thriller which has been condensed. However it is unfortunately cliché ridden film with little mystery or intrigue. It really could had been a made for television film but for its starry cast.The characters although real, are just cyphers there to develop the story. Neither Maria nor Randol felt like real people to me even though we get flashbacks of a young Maria in Nazi Austria and her attempts to flee the regime. In the modern day setting the museum officials and the Austrian officials are made to look like stereotypical bad guys wanting to keep the painting at any costs or in this case hoping to spin things out until the elderly Maria dies.The performances are earnest, the flashbacks give the film weight which the script really does not deserve and the direction was pedestrian.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Highly Compelling True Story; Great Performances!,"I just watched this gem of a movie a second time, and enjoyed it even more the second time around. Helen Mirren is a stellar talent.A nice, more serious turn for Reynolds, and he was well up to the task. Very well written, with sensitively woven flashbacks. The thing that gripped me this time was the deep sense of terror I felt watching the scenes of Nazi abuse. When they come into the home and begin to inventory items as the family watches in horror, I could barely breath. (And now, after the Hamas atrocities, the different brands and levels of terror were sharply contrasted.)
A love story during dangerous times, impossible decisions people HAD to make, the unraveling of decades of injustices across nations, and one of the most remarkably unique portraits I have ever seen; this movie is eminently watchable!",9.0,Anonymous,History
I lose any faith in professional critics,"As one or two other non-professional reviewers have said, I just don't understand the many negative reviews from the professionals. As a Jew, I found the film totally gripping and beautifully done in every way. The film is grounded in the Holocaust and faithfully portrays the vicious treatment of Jews by the Austrian people as well as the Nazis. The later intransigent attitude of the Austrian authorities who will do anything to hang on to the stolen painting should come as no surprise. Austria has never admitted its culpability in the Nazi atrocities and never will, unlike Germany.I have substantial doubts about the sensitivity of these negative reviewers to the plight of the Jews at that time. Their childish complaint seems to be that the film isn't exciting enough and is schmaltzy. I found it gripping and truthful.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Maybe I'm a little bias because I'm a huge Helen Mirren fan (I'd pay to watch her read the phone book).Beyond that, this is a beautifully constructed movie that artfully blends past and present into a compelling David vs. Goliath story. It's climax reminds me of the ending of Field of Dreams. I won't spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't seen it but when you realize why Maria fought for her family's legacy it has the same emotional impact as when Kevin Costner realizes that his entire journey was to reconnect with his fatherI highly recommend this movie.

Good Story - Terrible Casting,"I liked the movie and it tells an important story; however, throughout watching the movie I just kept asking myself - why Ryan Reynolds? Let's be honest, he'd be more believable as the poster boy for the Hitler youth movement than as his role playing the Jewish attorney Randy Schoenberg. I'm not suggesting that you have a Jew play a Jew, but Reynolds was so out of character that in my opinion it detracted from the film. Perhaps they thought by have Reynold's as the male lead, they'd attract a larger audience. I guess we'll never know one way or the other.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"Failing, Again the Term 'Justice'","Okay, yes, this is a movie that I might buy, BUT I am left pondering if I should or would.Yes, it is well produced, enticing to watch and is a fairly (accurate?) portrayal of circumstances from our human history.But, the movie left me aching about the shallowness of 'Hollywood' when it comes to dealing with the word 'justice'. IF you take the time to watch the bonus features that come with the DVD, the actors and producers pat themselves on the back for portraying another story where justice is actually served. At least, in the eyes of the rich from our society.Oh, so watch the movie. It is, mostly, worth the time for the scenery and the quality of acting. But then take some moments afterward to wonder why it is that we are so 'feel good' about human history that registers another lawyer whose first motive was not 'justice' but for the fact that he might make some big money after returning one painting, worth over ""$100 million"", back to its rightful owners.So, what. The real people in life took some of that money and donated it to charities and 'holocaust memorials'? Answer me this.When do we get the movie that addresses this issue: ponder why it must only be multi-million paintings that equate 'justice' for too many in our society whilst we fail to ask how we ensure that the poor among us, today, gain real justice? WE forget the man, woman and child who was too poor to escape such things and whose teeth became the gold bricks that continue to tarnish this world of 'the rich' only being the ones to have a right to justice. Because they have 'gold'.That is why I left watching this movie feeling despondent. When do WE stop building memorials to holocausts and start BUILDING institutions of democracy that are indeed FOR the poor, on the basis of 'equal before and under the law'?That is a problem that Hollywood is too reluctant to address because it would challenge their own rich perceptions.So, watch the movie but watch it with open eyes to its ultimate hypocrisy: it is just another movie about the rich gaining the right to a word poor people are still denied, despite the lessons from what caused the events of 'the Woman in Gold' to transpire.And that is the saddest comment for our societies of 2015. This movie fails because it glitters with gold.Don MacAlpine, Wolseley, Saskatchewan, Canada",5.0,Anonymous,History

Two Historical Dramas Worth Your Time,"IF YOU'RE LOOKING for quality productions and thought provoking themes that carry into post-screening over-coffee conversation and well beyond, two new historical dramas topped by A-list stars are just what the doctor ordered.""Woman in Gold,"" starring Helen Mirren as a woman determined to reclaim a lost art work stolen by the Nazis, and ""The Water Diviner,"" directed by Russell Crowe and starring him as a father determined to find his three presumed-dead sons following the Battle of the Gallipoli, are those rare films that handle scope and intimacy with equal adeptness.In 'Gold,"" a British-American production directed by Simon Curtis from a script by Alexi Kaye Campbell, Mirren plays the late Maria Altmann, an aging Jewish refugee living in Los Angeles who enlists a young lawyer named Randy Schoenberg (played to perfection by Ryan Reynolds in a bit of Jimmy Stewart channeling) to fight the government of Austria to reclaim Gustav Klimt's iconic portrait of her aunt, ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer,"" which was stolen by the Nazis from her relatives just before World War II. Altmann took her fight all the way to the United State Supreme Court _ and Austria.To say much more would spoil the film, but suffice it to say that the writing, directing and acting are so skillfully rendered that the story is both moving and educational without being maudlin or dull.Mirren is completely believable as Altmann, and Reynolds opens eyes as young attorney Schoenberg. The supporting cast _ Katie Holmes (as Schoenberg's wife), Daniel Bruhl, Tatiana Maslany, Max Irons, Charles Dance, Elizabeth McGovern (as a judge!!) and Jonathan Pryce _ show their respect for the piece and its subject matter through wonderfully understated performances.The film was screened in the Berlinale Special Galas section of the Berlin International Film Festival.""The Water Diviner,"" or ""Last Hope,"" an historical fictional drama, is an Australian production directed by and starring Crowe with a screenplay written by Andrew Anastasios and Andrew Knight from a book of the same name by Andrew Anastasios and Dr. Meaghan Wilson- Anastasios.The film begins in 1919, just after World War I (1914-1918), as Joshua Connor (Crowe), an Australian farmer and water diviner, has discovered ground water on his land and is digging a well. His three sons have left to serve with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) at the Battle of Gallipoli five years before and are thought to have been killed in battle.When Joshua's devastated wife, Eliza (Jacqueline McKenzie), commits suicide because of the loss, he vows to bring back their bodies and bury them next to hers. Joshua travels to Turkey and stays in an Istanbul hotel operated by Ayshe (a hauntingly beautiful reed of a woman, Olga Kurylenko), who has been widowed by the war, and grows close to her little son, Orhan (a charming Dylan Georgiades), whose unusual way of bringing Joshua to his mother's hotel is alone worth the price of admission. Ayshe at first is suspicious of Joshua, but after learning about his reasons for being in Turkey, that changes, much to the chagrin of her brother-in-law, who had coveted her as his own.Ayshe suggests that Joshua bribe a fisherman so he can go to Gallipoli by boat. He does, and upon arriving there, meets all sorts of resistance, especially from the ANZACs, who are taking part in a mass burial detail from which civilians are banned. There he meets Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan in a riveting turn), a Turkish officer who is helping on the mission. The major becomes a friend and ally of Joshua's and we're off to the races.""The Water Diviner"" at times boasts the kind of lush scope used by director David Lean in films like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago,"" and like those films, manages to flesh out both character and story with unusual depth and intimacy.Both ""Woman in Gold"" and ""The Water Diviner"" give the audience a run for their money, providing a sense of emotional attachment while offering historical perspective and enlightenment.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Could Have Been a Great Movie,"I didn't know what to expect when going to see ""Woman In Gold"" yesterday.But I totally agree with many of the reviewers who felt the movie lacked emotion.

Even though I can't put my finger on the why of his lacklustre portrayal he seemed to try too hard in this role. He didn't seem natural at all. I much preferred the Austrian investigative reporter.He seemed much more genuine. This story is true and I felt that with the right screenwriter and some casting changes it would have been a movie as wonderful as ""Philomena"" which is also based on a true story but much more believably done.I loved The story of Philomena and it touched me emotionally while ""Woman in Gold"" has left me cold and detached.Watch this film on DVD rather than spend your money at the theatre.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Woman in Gold,"While watching the new film, Woman in Gold, based upon the true life stories of Maria Altmann and Randol Schoenberg, I couldn't help, but think of caparisons and links between this film and last year's The Monuments Men. Both films deal with World War II and recovering art that was stolen by the Nazis during that time. While, The Monuments Men was a bit more of a period piece in some ways, Woman in Gold, flashes back between the past and present, but mostly deals with the present time. I personally enjoyed George Clooney's The Monuments Men, even though the film was anything but embraced by critics, who more, or less called the film a mess. While not my favourite film of last year, or even of George Clooney, I still found a lot to admire and appreciate about that film. Woman in Gold, as I mentioned above, does deal with a very similar subject, only I feel it is more of a personal account of one woman and her lawyer's experience with this than the men who went to recover the art in The Monuments Men. I feel that because, Woman in Gold, is dealing with real people and how they have been affected by the Nazi tragedies of the second World War and how they are now trying in a small way to get a piece of their heritage back, and we see the different emotions as well as the anger and resentment that still met them on their journey to do this, that for this reason alone, I find Woman in Gold, to be a much more personal film than The Monuments Men, and also a better made film in general, while I still did like both films. Unfortunately it seems that a lot of critics are dismissing Woman in Gold, much like they did with The Monuments Men, although this one is getting slightly better reviews than the previous film. I personally found a lot to like here. Helen Mirren, who I have always found to be a really solid actress, delivers another great performance here as Maria Altmann. Mirren's portrayal of her is as a feisty older woman who has seen a lot of tragedy and endured a lot of hardships in her life because of the second World War, but in her own way she is definitely a fighter and is a strong willed and courageous woman and also stubborn in a good way, whereas when she sets her heart and goals on something she will set out to achieve them, even if the situation looks hopeless. I found I cared deeply for this character and her strong willed spirit and also her feistiness was contagious and I could laugh and be amused at her character often as well. It was a great performance of Mirren's that goes along with many of her others. Ryan Reynolds, I have not seen in a lot of films, simply because a lot of what he normally stars in, is not the type of films that I would normally go and see. I have however found that he is getting better with his film choices lately like Adventureland and last year's The Captive. Both films I liked very much. I have never seen, Buried, but heard he was very good in there and that it was probably his strongest performance to date. Having said that, I found that he was excellent here as Randol Schoenberg, Maria's lawyer who eventually turned into her biggest supporter and close friend. At the start of the film, his character is not that interested in taking on Maria's case, but once he decides to do so and reflects on past memories, or what he finds out about his own and also Maria's past with the second World War, he is bound and determined to help her recover what was rightfully hers at any cost, no matter the money, or difficulties they may go through trying to achieve this. His character his certainly strong willed in his own way too and you really warm up to him in the second and third acts of the film and I think his character is just as fascinating and well played as Maria, and Mirren's portrayal of her as well. What makes, Woman in Gold, more than just a pleasing period piece film for two hours is the strong performances by it's two very capable lead actors here as well as the very impressive attention to detail the filmmaking crew used to make this story come to life as well as the fact that this is a really interesting true story and along the way we deeply care for these characters and their mission and really want to see them achieve what at one time seems impossible. The back story of Maria's life growing up during Nazi occupied Austria, to the fight she has in the present day is both equally captivating and riveting in it's own way. Randol's contemporary story is just as good as we see him trying to leave his mark in the world as a lawyer and also trying to raise a new family as well. As, I said before we really get to care for and root for these characters all the way. Overall, this is certainly a crowd pleasing film that will certainly please fans of Mirren, and make new fans of Reynolds and for any history and art lovers as well. A really well done and made picture that is better than what the critics are saying.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Why the Antisemitic critics slammed this film ?,"I would prefer an out and out Nazi to a covertly antisemitic critic any day. They have become politicians instead of remaining film critics. They do not have an issue with portraying Germans or Austrians in a bad light during World War 2 but they do have an issue with showing Germans or Austrians who subscribe to the same ideology after the war even if it is factual. In their narrow and insular minds Austria changed overnight and since this film bursts their bubble they gave it bad reviews. It is the ONLY reason. This has exposed their ultra-liberal leanings and moral and intellectual bankruptcy. Because they are deniers of history and out of sync with reality I have decided to expose them with this review and give this film a 10.

Very basic with no thrills! 3/10,"Review: After watching half an hour of this film, I totally lost interest in the whole plot and I fell asleep a couple of times. It's not that the performances were bad because I really liked Maria Altmann, played by Helen Mirren and the storyline was quite interesting but I just couldn't get into it. Its about a Jewish lady called Maria Altmann who hires her friends son Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds), to get back a painting which was stolen by the Nazis during World War II. Whilst searching for the evidence to prove that the famous Gustav Klimt painting of the her aunt was rightfully hers and that it didn't belong in a Austrian gallery, the trail leads to Austria were they have to hunt through loads of documentation to retrieve the Austrian treasure. None of the Austrians want to help Maria because they truly believe that it belongs in there country, so after trying many methods to get there case heard, they end up back in American, disheartened by the results. With the determination of Randy, he finds a loophole in the law which makes him risk everything to get the case heard. When all of the evidence is eventually put in front of a judge, it turns into a court drama which could have had more depth, after watching over an hours worth of investigating. I did like the chemistry between Mirren and Reynolds but Reynolds didn't seem like he was fully committed to the role. Mirren on the other hand, was brilliant and she really did make the film watchable even though I did drift off a couple of times. Anyway, I was hoping for a bit more from this film but it just turned out to be very basic and boring in parts. Average!Round-Up: At 70 years old, Mirren is definitely looking pretty impressive for her age and her performances seem to be getting better. She still has another 3 movies in the pipeline which include Trumbo starring Bryan Cranston and Eye in the Sky with Alan Rickman so she's not ready to retire to live off of her pension just yet. Ryan Reynolds seems to dip in and out of comedic and action roles, from the Change Up to the Safe House and now he's added drama with this movie. His next couple of movies, Captive and Self/Less are thrillers so he really is covering every genre in his career. I do enjoy watching these two actors but I really couldn't get into this one. This is the second movie from director Simon Curtis who also brought you My Week With Marilyn, which I also didn't enjoy. He usually makes TV series, which explains why I didn't like the pace and the tone of this movie. In all, it is a watchable film, just because of Mirren but you are left feeling pretty empty because of the predictable storyline and straight laced script.

Excellent Film,"In a time where most movies are of inferior quality and/or pitiful remakes of previous films, this movie shines with excellence. It is the true story of a woman and her attorney's perseverance to acquire justice for a wrong from decades past. This is about the Holocaust, Nazism, and the Jewish people. I have seen many great movies on this subject but I would have to say this is one of the very best.

"Sentimental, involving and entertaining drama","Greetings from Lithuania.""Woman in Gold"" (2015) is shamefully sentimental, yet very entertaining and at the times moving picture. It tels a real story of a woman who wanted to return a painting stolen by Nazis from her family during WW2. The story takes place mainly in present times, but there is flashback story showing us of how did all happen back in the beginning of WW2.Acting was uniformly good by both leads, but especially by Helen Mirren - man does she also look beautiful at the age of 70! Script is engaging, and director did a very solid job in keeping this movie in pace - at running time 1 h 40 min this movie barely drags and involving from start till finish.Overall, ""Woman in Gold"" is a drama, but it's a very entertaining and involving one. It's expertly paced and although it's very sentimental at moments, it's never a ""tearjerker"" yet it manages to be moving mainly because of very good acting by Helen Mirren. This is a movie that many will adore. A solid 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Worthy but Wordy,"The ""Woman in Gold"" of the title is a painting, Gustav Klimt's ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"". (That Roman numeral was added to distinguish it from a second portrait of the same woman). Frau Bloch-Bauer was a beautiful young society lady from a wealthy Viennese Jewish family. She herself died in 1925, but the picture remained in the possession of her family until it was seized by the Nazis following the Anschluss of 1938. Klimt was not the Nazis' favourite artist- he was too modernistic for Hitler's ultra-conservative tastes- but he was not Jewish and was never officially condemned as ""degenerate"", so there was no ban on the public display of his art. In 1941 the painting was acquired by the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna where it hung for many years. (The Nazis were embarrassed by the fact that Klimt's sitter had been Jewish, so the name of the painting was changed to ""Woman in Gold""). In 1998, however, Adele's last surviving relative, her niece Maria Altmann, now living in Los Angeles, began a legal fight to recover the stolen painting.The Austrian government resisted the claim doggedly, basing their opposition on the fact that in her will Adele had expressed the wish that the painting should hang in the Belvedere. There were, however, two problems with their defence. The first was that Adele had wished that the picture should only go to the Belvedere after the death of her husband Ferdinand, who was still alive in 1941. The second, and more serious, objection was that the painting was not actually Adele's to dispose of- it was legally Ferdinand's property, not hers.The film is based on the true story of this legal battle, concentrating on the relationship between Maria and her young lawyer, Randy Schoenberg. The two had a lot in common, both being descended from the cultured, intellectual Jewish haute bourgeoisie of Vienna. They shared a love of music; Randy was the grandson of the famous composer, Arnold Schoenberg, and Maria's late husband, Fritz, had been an opera singer. Intercut with the legal action are scenes showing Maria's early life and her flight from Vienna to escape from the Nazis in 1938.I watched this film when it was recently shown in television, partly because I am an art lover and partly because of my respect for Helen Mirren, but in many way it proved a disappointment. Mirren as Maria Altmann was certainly good, as she normally is, but she was about the only good thing in this film. There have been many excellent films based upon court cases, but such courtroom dramas have nearly all been about criminal trials, focussing on conflicting evidence and dramatic scenes of cross-examination in the witness-box. Civil actions, which rely more on legal argument and precedents and which may not even involve any testimony from live witnesses, rarely make for such engrossing drama.The case of Republic of Austria v. Altmann does not prove an exception to the rule. The lengthy scenes of discussions and legal arguments are worthy but wordy, and the flashbacks to the 1930s (for some reason shot in a very dull, muted colour) do not provide much relief from the tedium. (We know from the beginning that Maria will survive, so there is little tension). The story of the wholesale looting of European art by the Nazis, of the legal fight for restitution and of the various moral issues involved is a potentially fascinating one; it deserved a better cinematic treatment than this. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
A golden blend of a film played to perfection by an exquisite cast,"I discovered this film ""hidden"" in the BBC's iPlayer and was sufficiently intrigued by the blurb including a picture of Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds to press ""start watching"". I was not drawn to the story so much but by the ""unusual"" combination of these stars. The story itself is somewhat predictable (I didn't know the specifics of Maria Altmann's case beforehand) so setting that aside where do my 8 stars come from? There are 2 contributors the characterisation and the cast. Mirren and Reynolds both fully fill-out the roles. Whilst you expect that of the Dame, seeing an actor more familiar to me from Hollywood action and comedy movies in a ""serious"" role has confirmed Mr Reynolds as one of my favourites. The relationship between them is well played with very believable mixes of cheekiness and extreme tension that you could see forming over a number a years as each tries to understand the other. Reynold's coming to terms with the holocaust (when the bleak reality that it really happened hits you whatever your upbringing is) is authentic as is Mirren's portrayal of a strong survivor carrying a deep sense of loss, scarred like so many of that global generation. The interplay between the two leads in the last scenes where justice is served but not without the taint of bitterness is particularly fine. The supporting cast is superb, and there are big names here, but no one oversteps their own role. Daniel Brühl is very well cast. It was also a delight to find Elizabeth McGovern as the story turned around one corner. Overall the film struck the right chord of telling a story about justice and good conquering evil. I didn't think the film set out to make you feel sorry for someone who came from a very privileged background and lost everything and then happy that they became very rich at the end of it all any more than if it was anyone else. For me it was more a story of embarking on an important journey late in life taking a risk, challenging the status quo and doing the right thing. All of this with the trust and encouragement of friends and fellow human beings who have your back.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Stunning FIlme and a Must-See,"Warning; review contains spoilers The title of this stunning movie refers to a famous painting. Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (better known as The Woman in Gold) is a 1907 painting by Gustav Klimt. The first of two portraits Klimt painted of Bloch-Bauer, it has been referred to as the final and most fully representative work of his golden phase.Adele Bloch-Bauer (1881–1925) was a refined art-loving Viennese woman, a patron and close friend of Gustav Klimt The painting was among the thousands of valuable works of art stolen from Jewish families by the Nazis, and the movie details the true story of Maria Altmann's struggle to regain possession of the painting. The subject of the painting was Altmann's aunt, and Altman was present when Hitler's Nazi thugs looted the artwork from the family home in Vienna.Helen Mirren gives yet another stunning performance as Maria Altmann, who, after the funeral of her sister discovers letters and papers in her sister's effects that prompt her to begin her journey to recover the painting.Mirren is one of those rare actors and actresses who actually ""become"" the role they're portraying. Meryl Streep is another such actress. For example, when you watch a Tom Cruise movie, you're always very much aware that you're watching Tom Cruise at work. When you watch movies with actresses like Mirren and Streep in them the actresses become the character. They somehow have the ability to make you forget that you're watching someone plying a role. Mirren was totally convincing as an aging, machine gun toting, spy in Reds, and she is totally convincing in this film, as well.Ryan Reynolds portrays the young lawyer who helped Maria Altmann recover her family property, and he showed in this film that he can be so much more than the sexy pretty boy he played in Green Lantern.During their attempts to recover the painting, the story of Altmann's family, and her escape from Nazi-occupied Austria is told in a series of flashback, and we are reminded yet again of man's inhumanity to man.Maria Altmann began her fight to recover the painting when she was 82 years old, and she died in 2011 at the age of 94.At the risk of being repetitious, I will say it again, this was a stunning film. And a moving one.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Austria vs. Altmann.,"This marks the graduation of director Simon Curtis from the small screen to the large but his first feature alas has the look of a film made for television.Behind every great painting lies a story and Gustave Klimt's gold-leaf portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer is certainly no exception but in the hands of Mr. Curtis this fascinating tale becomes merely interesting.Maria Altmann was a formidable character and her indomitable spirit is captured here by Helen Mirren. There is a touching performance by Henry Goodman as Ferdinand, the Jewish banker who commissioned the great Symbolist painter Klimt to immortalise his wife and who was to die penniless in Switzerland. I have never been convinced by Ryan Reynolds as an actor and his weak, expressionless performance as lawyer Schoenberg does little to change my view.Far be it from me to question Maria Altmann's motives but no sooner had her uncle's paintings been restored to her after seven years of legal wrangling, she promptly sold both this portrait and the less renowned Adele Bloch-Bauer portrait for astronomical sums.Although the film is more brass than gold, should it encourage a few to discover more of Klimt and his Vienna Secession contemporaries, then it will have served its purpose.",5.0,Anonymous,History

There's a lot of gold here; historical and acting gold in Woman in Gold,"I've never really thought about it much, as a lot of people who visit art museums, but maybe I should consider the history of art a bit more. It's not that I want to know how something was painted or who it was by (the museum description usually takes care of that), but just with how it made it's way on this particular wall. Sometimes they'll make it clear that it was a donation, purchase or that it might be on tour, but let's say you find out that a beautiful renaissance painting was stolen from someone years ago. Something that would make me question not just the value of the work, but with the practices and standards of the museum that collected it.A story like Woman in Gold relies an interesting tale of getting back not just any art, but a piece of work that's so valuable that no one would want it to leave their country. This may be a story about art, but it's also another story about the travesty of the actions of the Nazis and how their actions are still being foxed in today's time. In that case, Woman in Gold may be more important then we may realize.An elderly Maria Altmann (played by Helen Mirren) is living in Los Angeles when her past comes back in the form of some letters written by her recently deceased sister. Her sister tried to make a case to get back some artwork that was taken from the Nazis during their rise in Germany. Through flashbacks, we find that Maria came from a wealthy Austrian Jewish family that had lost most of their property during the persecution, and that while Maria and her husband were able to escape, her parents were unfortunate victims and dies in a Death Camp.Through a friend, she hires Randol Schoenberg (played by Ryan Reynolds), a lawyer who has no experience within the law of art, to help her get back her families most loved portrait, ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"". The big problem though is that the country of Austria regards this as one their ""Mona Lisa"" and will do anything to make sure that they don't lose it. Maria and Randol fly to Vienna and after meeting with a reporter Hubertus Czernin (played by Daniel Brühl), they begin their big case to retrieve back what's rightfully theirs.With it's focus on a WWII story and that our hero of the movie is elderly, it's obvious that it's target audience is not the same as one that's going to watch a summer blockbuster. So rather then to put any large stars in here, Woman in Gold only cast a few well knowns and embraces it's more play-like feel then something cinematic. What I mean is that the dialogue is heavy and requires you to pay a lot of interest in art history. In the case of myself, I liked it as I do follow the world of art; maybe not as much as the movies, but I found the subject matter fascinating enough that it made me want to know more about this old lady and her wanting her families property back.Helen Mirren is great as Maria, giving us a no nonsense but likable personality that I may have seen before, but Mirren always gives good performances. As much as I rant on Ryan Reynolds, he's better suited here then he was for roles in Green Lantern and Turbo, being able to play a more quiet and reserved guy then he can cocky. Woman in Gold may not be two hours, but it does feel a little long when we get that cliché of one leaving the party even though we know their going to come back and face their fears. Had this been rewritten into something more out of the box, this would have been an academy award movie that should have been saved for the end of the year. But even had it been shorter, nothing in The Woman in Gold really says ""revolutionary"", but it is likable enough to enjoy as a story.I'll give this eight portraits of Adele Bloch-Bauer I out of ten. Most history fans should like this as those that are into art. I doubt I would see it again on home video, but then again, maybe I'll give it another rental",8.0,Anonymous,History
Absorbing Film,"In case I forget, Helen Mirren was quite outstanding. Why she didn't win any awards for her performance I cannot fathom.I wish they had made it clear from the outset that this was a true story. Obviously there is some artistic license, but the essence is a biography of Maria Altmann;'s efforts to recover her family's artwork stolen by the Nazis following the occupation of Austria.Maria Altmann, an elderly Jewish refugee living in Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, who, together with her young lawyer, Randy Schoenberg, fought the government of Austria for almost a decade to reclaim Gustav Klimt's iconic painting of her aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, which was stolen from her relatives by the Nazis in Vienna just prior to World War II. Altmann took her legal battle all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled on the case Republic of Austria v. Altmann (2004).",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Great Story, Conventionally Constructed","While watching ""The Woman in Gold,"" the new film from director Simon Curtis, I was constantly reminded of a few other films. Namely, ""The Monuments Men,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""Saving Mr. Banks."" This was mainly because of similar story lines. Whether it be restitution of art stolen by Nazis, flashbacks to the tragic love story of an old woman, or a woman brought to Los Angeles for unwanted reasons, I kept returning to other Hollywood films I had seen, and that was the main downfall with this filmThe film shifts between 1998 and the Holocaust-era as we follow Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren.) After her sister's death, she realizes that a famous family artwork was taken by Nazis and put in a museum in her home country of Austria. She recruits and up-and-coming lawyer, Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds), who also has an Austrian lineage, to help her find a legal way to have the piece returned to her.To Randy, the case is about the money. The artwork is worth millions of dollars and he thinks of it as a way to bring him to the top of the legal world in L.A. But to Maria, it has nothing to do with the money. Her aunt is the woman portrayed in the painting, and she was very important to her. It is also a portal to Maria's deceased family, as she and her husband were able to escape Nazi reign whereas other family members weren't so lucky. There is a flashback to a scene between a young Maria and her aunt. They are looking at the painting and Maria asks why there is so much gold, to which the aunt says not to look at the gold, but at the face. This encapsulates what this film is about, and the roles of young Maria and her aunt can be directly related to older Maria and Randy. It's not about the money or even what the money says; it's about Maria getting justice for the crime committed against her family.The film does many things right. The plot itself is intriguing and demands the attention of the artist. The pairing of Mirren and Reynolds is priceless, and the two play their roles brilliantly. This may be the best we've seen from Reynolds, and Hellen Mirren is...well...Hellen Mirren. The script is fine, save for a few cliché ""inspirational speech"" scenes and the nonlinear storytelling allows us to relate to Maria and sympathize for her.Despite all the rights, their are elements of the film that keep it from achieving ""great"" status. The huge problem is that the film is so conventional; there are things in this film that you can see in nearly every Hollywood film, which may be part of the reason it reminded me of so many others. There are no risks taking in the editing, and it is shot so safely. As aforementioned, there are those dramatic, emotional, and ultimately unneeded speeches and scenes that make the film somewhat cliché. So many times it seems like the director is trying to clinch every little emotion out of us, and it can get exhausting at times. A number of these come from Randy's wife, played Katie Holmes, who sometimes drove me crazy with the sentimentality. Another thing that drove me crazy involved an element of Maria. While she was very likable about 80 percent of the time, there were those scenes where she claims they should just give up. It happens a good four or five times, and it makes it hard to root for someone who seems so undetermined. I don't know if this is what she was really like, but if it is, this is a place where Curtis could have taken a little liberty.Despite its struggles, ""The Woman in Gold"" tackles its topic with a certain conviction. Here is a real-life man and woman who beat the odds, take on an entire government, and learn to work together as wonderful companions. The transformation of Reynolds' character is unbelievable to watch and Maria's story is one for the ages. The truth is that it is a very good film that could have been great had Simon Curtis chosen to take more risks and be a little more unconventional.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Good story, sad casting","First of all, the film itself is very good in every way. Every now and then something was depicted completely idiotic or modern in the retrospect overlooked, which is half as bad.Then why am I rating so low? Well, that's easy to explain: if in a film about Austria with apparently only Austrians, only 1 person is actually Austrian in real life and then only has a mini-role with 10 seconds, the producer must be condemned for it.If a complete film is made about a particular country, at least some of it should be occupied by residents of that country.

Compelling portrayal of a true story.,"I have an affinity for historical stories, and the juxtaposition of the past and the present in this is something that was superbly done. The transitions between the two times seem so effortless and natural like the slow pan of a camera, and it wasn't disorienting at all.Irons and Maslany have great chemistry and did a great job acting wise. Mirren and Reynolds too did really well, but to be honest I don't really understand Reynolds' character much. His look and demeanour is sometimes that of a shy, awkward person, but he isn't really like that plus the fact that he's a lawyer makes it a little more confusing since lawyers are mostly the opposite. Or maybe it was Reynold's acting On the other hand Mirren gives an outstanding performance and accurately captures the emotions of her character that the audience cannot help but feel for her.The decorations and costumes – especially that of the past, was really intricate and detailed. A very artsy kind of atmosphere with many valued belongings, which makes me wonder what the father/ father's brother did for a living but we never really find out.Also, though the storyline is not complicated, I kind of lost track with the legal procedures for a little bit. They go through many sort of 'trials', but it got clearer as the film went on.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,History
Woman In Gold Is Pure Gold,"First of all, there can never be a bad movie if it has within its cast the superb Helen Mirren. She is that good. And Ryan Reynolds is no slouch in the acting field, either. I so enjoyed his role in this movie as a young attorney, feeling his way into a career and having the case of a lifetime dropped in his lap. Watching him learn and cope was perfect. Nicely written, well plotted, and I very much liked the shifting back and forth from the early war days as the legal problem was set up to the present time as the solution unfolded. For me, there was one scene where Katie Holmes, as Reynold's wife, has a rather abrupt flip-flop in her thinking that had me convinced the writers couldn't find a better way to accomplish thator perhaps they simply ran out of timewho knows.

"Woman in Gold - great movie, important historical message","""Woman in Gold"" is more than a moving feature film based on a true story, starring a legend like Helen Mirren. It also conveys an important historical message about Austria's complicity in the Holocaust. For too long, Austria has gotten away with being the ""first victim"" of (German) Nazi aggression (the Allies characterized Austria as the ""first victim"" at Yalta in order to encourage (almost non-existent) Austrian resistance). ""Woman in Gold"" destroys that myth and shows the true level of complicity. The documentary that inspired ""Woman in Gold"" - ""Stealing Klimt"" (www.stealingklimt.com) - also shows the true level of Austrian complicity and actually shows in greater detail than ""Woman in Gold"" the level of terror and theft that occurred during WW2 and some historical facts that do not make it into ""Woman in Gold"", like Maria's husband, Fritz being sent to Dachau, like Maria's brother being saved by one of Hitler's relations (Hiedler), about how the Austrian Government was given the opportunity to buy the five Klimts at market price but decided not to!

Well written and well acted telling of a true story.,"This isn't a great movie, but it's very good, it's well done and engaging. It addresses a thorny issue - many Austrians welcomed the Nazis with open arms and were more than happy to watch the degradation of the Jews by the Nazis. While this question underlies the storyline, the issue doesn't overwhelm the movie.The script is strong. The real Schoenberg was a consultant on the film, so it should be pretty accurate. The acting is also strong. Helen Mirren is always great and Ryan Reynolds puts in a solid performance too, especially in the short scene after his character visits the Holocaust memorial in Vienna. It wasn't a big emotional drama, but quietly understated and well acted. The chemistry between the 2 main characters by the end of the movie is convincing. Katie Holmes does a good job in her role, though it isn't a big role. Daniel Bruhl was very strong in his role, and he's generally very good in everything I've seen him in.The one annoyance for me was the casting of Elizabeth Macgovern as an American judge. She didn't have a big role either, but as soon as she appeared on screen, there was a ripple through the audience ""Downton Abbey"". This woman really can't act. The simpering, head tilted, looking up expression of the Countess from Downton was thankfully not quite there in full force in her one scene in this movie. But really she just can't act and has one expression in every movie or series that she's in, including this one. When I looked at her bio, I wasn't at all surprised to see that she's married to the director of this film. Because that could be the only possible reason that she was cast.So apart from that one annoyance, I'd happily recommend this movie to anyone. It could have been presented in a more dramatic way, more of a WWII escape thriller, more of a courtroom drama, but the director chose to go with a straightforward telling of a very interesting story, with excellent use of flashbacks. Really it was well done.",8.0,Anonymous,History
SLOW but so is life,"Excellent acting, which makes the story completely believable. But I must confess it was hard to like the stoic, cold personality of Mrs. Altman, until the end. Definitely Loved this movie, but it hit a nerve, and for me it is a very sad commentary on a greedy and jealous world. I've learned too much about the holocaust, and know people affected by the cruelty and murderous actions of the Germans, while the world stood by and did absolutely nothing about it for the most part. I Followed this story in the News years ago. And I'm delighted this film was created to share the important history, of another aspect of what was done to the Jewish people. I honestly do t know how How Germany can live with itself, and it should be doing absolutely everything in its power to return money, homes, jewelry, art and more to the Jewish survivors or relatives of the victims of the holocaust.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Visually stunning, but overplays emotional aspects at expense of other elements","""Woman in Gold"" is visually stunning and brilliantly performed. It is much better than suggested by its trailer. Production values are superb. However, it is still a bit disappointing.At one point in ""Woman in Gold,"" an Austrian citizen confronts Mirren's Altmann character and asks why you (Jewish) people can't forget the past, commenting, ""Not everything is about the Holocaust."" The comment is cynical, as the Austrian people personified by the character oppose Altmann because they want to celebrate and admire a painting stolen from her family that became part of Austrian heritage in the minds of many. As it relates to Maria Altmann, the statement is cruel, insensitive and unfair; however, one might direct a similar comment to the producers of the film.It is a story with many facets. Her husband Fritz was imprisoned at Dachau to compel his brother to transfer a business to the Nazis. There is quite a story behind the sweater that Altmann is seen folding at her shop. Obviously, the filmmakers had to make choices as to what to include. They chose to put a lot of emphasis on the theme of rediscovering one's heritage. The Austrians consider the disputed paintings part of their national heritage. Altmann turned her back on Austria and swore never to return. Schoenberg gets in touch with his Jewish and Austrian heritage. Much of this story is told in flashbacks to the Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938. It's beautifully photographed and superb filmmaking, but we've seen it all before in ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" ""Life is Beautiful"" and dozens of other films.By devoting what seems like half the running time to historical scenes, the filmmakers tell one story effectively, but ignore unique aspects of the current story. I would have liked to see more of Shoenberg's story. I'd like to have seen him fail at his own firm and know what he did at Bergen Brown Sherman – what did he sacrifice to represent Altmann? What happened to the necklace and other things stolen from the Bloch-Bauers? The legal battle raised several intriguing issues, but the court scenes presented primarily emotional appeals to justice and equity, not legal arguments. If Lauder was willing to underwrite the cost of the legal battle and interested enough in the painting to pay a record $135MM at auction, why did he abandon negotiations with Altmann so easily?The historical scenes were well done, but they crowded out other material that might have been more interesting.Although the two central Jewish characters were both played by gentiles, the film has a very pro-Semitic slant that was distracting at times. The Jewish characters are intelligent, astute, cultured, multi-lingual, industrious, talented, successful, devoted to their families, patient, clever, world renown, etc., etc., etc. The Austrian gentiles are generally spiteful, anti-Semitic, duplicitous, uncultured, bureaucratic, unsympathetic, boorish Nazi sympathizers and unscrupulous thieves.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Feel-Good Film, Written entirely in Cliché.","Let us start by saying that Helen Mirren gave an amazing performance in this fact-based drama. She performed beautifully, despite the script consisting entirely of cliché. Being a holocaust story, it's likely unpopular to give criticism, but I must give credit where credit is due.Taking entire acts directly from Philomena, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and even The People Vs Larry Flynt, the film is painfully predictable.Helen Mirren gives it her all, but the entire supporting cast is comprised of caricatures of antisemitism, Ryan Reynolds the bumbling father (Your water broke! What do we do!?), the angry boss, and lesser players.It's a feel-good flick, but the beauty of Amsterdam is overshadowed by the unbelievable population with really unbelievable motivations.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Important Victory Over Fascism's Rape of Europa 70 Years in the Making: A Story About More than Art Restiutution,"In 1907, early-modern painter Gustav Klimt (1862–1918) created the first of two portraits of a beautiful Viennese Jewish woman, Adele Bloch-Bauer (1881-1925). The painting on canvas incorporates both oil and gold leaf giving the work a beautiful sparkle when seen in person, almost like a large golden jewel. The painting incorporates traditional representation and abstract elements. While the upper part of the woman is certainly discernible, i.e. face, neck, breast, and hands, the rest of the painting reflects both the Art Nouveau and modernist style coming into vogue in the 20th century. Ancient Egyptian-like eyes adorn her golden dress towards the bottom, and geometric patterns surround her face. Although the official name of the painting is simply ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"" by Gustav Klimt, it has been nicknamed ""Woman in Gold"" and regarded as the Mona Lisa of Austria.The Klimt portrait has a violent and horrific history. In the early 20th century, the family of Adele Bloch-Bauer was a prominent Viennese family making their wealth through commerce, and the painting hung majestically in their lavish apartments. Tragically, Adele Bloch-Bauer died young in 1925 and had requested her two portraits be donated to the Austrian State Museum upon the death of her husband. Of course, she had no idea the scourge of fascist ideology would overtake her country only 10 years later. In 1938, the sitter's widower was compelled to flee Vienna when the German Reich annexed Austria. Although he escaped, dying in 1945, he was forced to leave behind his art collection including ""Woman in Gold"" and four additional Klimt paintings which were confiscated by the Nazis. The Klimt paintings would then reside in the Austrian State Gallery for the next half century.The story of the film begins in the 1990's. The niece of Adele Bloch-Bauer, Maria Altmann (played by Helen Mirren in an Academy-Award caliber performance), a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany now living in Los Angeles, has become aware of recent stories of so-called ""art restitution"", the reuniting of pilfered art to rightful ownership. Most of the restitution stories center on art plundered by the German Nazis in the 1930's and early 1940's, which, by some estimates, number in the 100,000's. She solicits the help of fairly green lawyer Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds), who, although born in America, has Austrian ancestry. In fact, he's the grandson of early-modernist composer Arnold Schoenberg who was also forced to flee Austria in the 1930's not only because of his Jewish background but because of his use of 12-tone serialism in his compositions, regarded as ""degenerate music"" by the Nazis.Altmann and Schoenberg become a team resolved to reclaim through the legal process the Klimt paintings stolen by the Nazis, including and most importantly ""Woman in Gold"". Their first step is to bring their case to the Art Restitution Board run by the powers-that-be of the state-run museums in Austria. Reluctantly, Altmann agrees to fly to Vienna with Schoenberg, the first time she has returned to the city of her youth. At first they seem to have a strong case. During their stay, the team of Altmann-Schoenberg find the documents of Bloch-Bauer regarding the paintings. It's not really a will in the legal sense, just a kind of ""wish"". The real will is that of Adele's widower, Ferdinand Block-Blauer, who names his heirs as his nieces, one of which is Maria Altmann.However, the plaintiffs suspect the museum doesn't want to give up the paintings without a fight. The board rejects their case, citing as legal grounds that the sitter of ""Woman in Gold"", Adele Bloch-Bauer, had consented to donate the portraits to Austria. The Austrian government further believes they have legal claim to the paintings because of the surviving documents, in this case the document written by Adele. Of course, being of Jewish origin and given the events which would transpire 10 years after her death, the plaintiffs are convinced Adele, had she lived, would have retracted such an offer. Also, it's a minor miracle the paintings survive at all, considering much of this kind of art was regarded as ""degenerate"" by the Nazis. They can sue the Austrian Museums in Vienna, but the legal costs would be astronomical. They seem to have lost. Then, just before they leave Vienna, the two visit the Holocaust Memorial. Schoenberg has an experience which becomes a turning point in the film, and he resolves to continue the fight. If they have any chance of succeeding, they need to find another means aside from directly suing the government in Austria.The film chronicles the plaintiff's continued legal battle to restore the Klimt paintings to their rightful heir, Maria Altmann. The Austrian government wanted to keep the Klimt paintings in Austria, in part because of its iconic nature. While they had an argument because of the importance of iconic art residing in countries of origin, there were greater issues involved. This case was not just about art; it was about justice, and the way the film plays out, the museum's argument dismisses fundamental issues about injustice.Three-quarters of a century ago, some extremists overtook the governments of Germany and Austria, led by one Adolph Hitler. They put into place rules which made Hitler absolute and unquestioned ruler. He decided that particular law-abiding legal residences of Germany and Austria had no legal rights only because they were of certain ethnic and religious origins. These people's lives were destroyed, being forced either to abandon their homes or forced into concentration and death camps. Some of these people owned wonderful art collections, and these were ""legally"" but wrongfully confiscated by the fascist regime. Nothing will make up for these losses. However, we as a civilized culture have a moral obligation to make restitution of the objects lost by living heirs. The restitution of art is not just about whether a piece of art belongs in a museum. It's about a statement against the wrongs of fascism.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Woman In Gold is definitely a solid film with electrifying performances,"Biopics are treat to eyes as it represents true incidents of a person portrayed on the silver screen. Woman in Gold follows the same trend. It is thoroughly captivating and fun to watch.Woman tells the story of two people Maria Altmann - a Jewish refugee, who fights with Austrian government for a painting which she believes belongs to her ancestor and Randol Schoenberg who support Maria against all odds.Simon Curtis, who previously directed My Week With Marlyn, rightfully chooses a niche subject but does well as a storyteller. He keeps audience engaged with each sequence in the film as the drama unfolds. I loved the flashback story portraying beautiful family of Maria Altmann. The screenplay will test your patience as movie does take time to build on you. As the main drama unfolds in the court begins, the movie takes an interesting turn and will definitely keep you tight till the end. Dialogues are worthy. Art direction is nice. Cinematography is good. Editing is crispy. The chemistry between Ryan Renolds and Helen Mirren is astounding and brilliant actors will mesmerize the audience with their heart-winning performances. Helen Mirren as usual is dependable. She is fiery as woman demanding her rights and emotional when she wins. Kudos to her brilliant portrayal of Maria Altmann. Ryan Reynolds takes you by surprise as a lawyer who believes himself and does what is right.On the whole, Woman In Gold is definitely a solid film with electrifying performances.

Helen Mirren's performance is the best thing about this film,"Woman in Gold, directed by Simon Curtis, is a compelling drama based on the true story of Maria Altmann - an elderly Jewish woman who embarks on a legal battle to reclaim a famous painting of her aunt, stolen by the Nazis during World War II. Alongside her inexperienced but determined lawyer, Randy Schoenberg, Maria seeks justice and closure for her family's past.The most notable thing about this movie is that Helen Mirren delivers a powerful performance, bringing depth and emotional nuance to Maria's character. Her portrayal captures both the pain of her memories and her tenacity in seeking restitution. Ryan Reynolds also offers a solid counterpoint, showcasing Schoenberg's evolution from a struggling lawyer to a passionate advocate.While Woman in Gold follows a somewhat conventional narrative structure, its strong performances and the emotional weight of its true story make it feel very impactful.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Fabulous true story,"This is a true story of a fight for justice. A wealthy Austrian Jewish family was robbed of their artwork during the Holocaust and 50 years later this battle was fought to restore the artwork to its rightful owners. I found only one glaring flaw. I love the work of Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds but neither one of them are remotely Jewish and that is obvious to Jewish people. The Weinstein brothers produced this film and could have made some attempt to cast the movie with Jewish actors but that was not done, likely in the name of box office receipts I assume.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Very Deep,Folks I would say that this is not a film for children not because it's violent it's not at all but it's very deep and intense there's a lot of historical context here that children under 13 or 14 are not going to understand I am almost 51 and I had trouble following it to some extentI believe it was Helen mirren who played the lady in gold the storyline was this woman in Los Angeles who was born in Austria during the war but with the Austrian government to get an a painting that her of her aunt back from the government that was stolen by the NazisI want to say more but I cannot to do so would be a spoilerThis is one of those films that's very well done with a very good storyline that is based on actual events this is definitely not for children under the teenage years not for tweens and only for teens in their later yearsI would give this movie a rating of NC-17But definitely well worth the attention of the adults in any house.,10.0,Anonymous,History
"This is a movie that words can't do justice to. All I have to say is watch this, you won't be disappointed.","""I have to do what I can to keep the memories alive because people never forget, especially the young."" Maria Altmann, (Mirren) has just lost her sister and after looking through her things she finds a letter that tells her the famous painting in Austria called the Woman in Gold has been left to her. She hires lawyer Randol (Reynolds) to help her get it back. What should be an easy thing becomes more and more difficult as Maria and Randol take on the Supreme Court and the entire country of Austria in the quest to return what Maria believes is rightfully hers. I wasn't that excited to watch this one, but that is because I don't usually watch previews before I see the movie. All that said this is one of the best movies I have seen in awhile. I love court room dramas, and while this isn't a straight court room movie, it had enough of that aspect to keep me intrigued. This is also a true story which I also love. Mirren and Reynolds play off each other great and the chemistry really helps the movie. I know nothing about this actual case so the entire movie left me wanting to know more. This is a movie that words can't do justice to. All I have to say is watch this, you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend this. Overall, simply just a great movie that I can't say enough about.

Part thriller and part travelogue--it's worth the trip.,"""Because people forget, you see. And then, of course, there's justice."" Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren)Keeping true to the memory of Holocaust victims and seeking the rightful return of art stolen are the driving forces of the pleasant Woman in Gold. The titular Klimt painting, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, formerly hanging in the Austrian State Gallery in Vienna, is the object of Maria Altmann's (Mirren) legal case against Austria based on her family's ownership and the Nazi's theft. The film is part low-key thriller and part modest travelogue (Vienna is now firmly on my bucket list), a smarter version of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel franchise, if you will.As in the recent biopic, Mr. Turner, about the great British landscape artist, this film also gets its energy from a painter's world-class vibe. Whereas the Turner biopic, as interpreted brilliantly by Mike Leigh, gives insight into the painter, Woman in Gold is more interested in the legal work that leads to a visit to the Supreme Court and back to Austria.Director Simon Curtis relies frequently on emotional music and the cool Maria to give a sense of the grand painting frequently referred to as ""the Mona Lisa of Austria."" A few expressive lines such as the opener to this essay are far too few given that a world-class painting should inspire many impressions and impassioned descriptions and interpretations. Maria sees mainly her Aunt while the world can see an entire era and country in her Aunt's necklace alone: ""People see a masterpiece by one of Austria's finest artists,"" Maria says of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, ""but I see my aunt.""Granted the true-life story as it tumbles from the painting is interesting enough, but the figurative possibilities are never explored. Yet the rewards are still there including Mirren's classy, relatively restrained performance and Ryan Reynolds' nerdy attorney, Randol Schoenberg (Grandson of Arnold). Together they present a formidable team opposing high-priced attorneys and an Austrian museum. Hooray for justice.""I have to do what I can to keep these memories alive."" Maria",,Anonymous,History
"Gustav Klimt.  Helen Mirren.

Jerry provides great insight into Maria Altmann's case – a fascinating triumph – everything from what to do if you find yourself before the U.S. Supreme Court and you don't understand the question – to how Maria Altmann's attorney found jurisdiction in a bookstore. Ryan Reynolds might have played a lawyer on the big screen, but ""Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act"" naturally rolls right off Jerry's tongue.Woman in GoldMeanwhile, O'Toole's nose was in the book inspired by the same set of characters: The Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Tale of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer by Anne-Marie O'Connor.
