The Best Animated Film I Have Ever Seen... revisited review some decades later,"This was a foundational text for little me - saw it multiple times theatrically to the point my dad just dropped me off at the Teaneck theater (3 bucks in those days) and watched it by myself for the first time - and back then as it still does today it manages to fill your belly in under 90 minutes with Mythical and even Mystical dimensions while also including Broadway stalwarts like Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella singing about flatulence. It isn't enough to channel Hamlet or other sources (or even other Disney epics), it's simply that the Lion King is a master's class in pacing and tone and economical storytelling. At heart what strikes me is that it's a saga that can mean a lot to children (and I'm sure adults/parents) because it's at core about that scene where Mufasa tells Simba he's disappointed. That is the worst.Tones are not clashing haphazardly, but flowing from one into another at just the right moments and intervals. You may be lulled into complacency in Hakuna Matata, and then you're reminded times are still dark (how Zazu lived so long is kind of a miracle IMO). It earns its sorrow and painful moments, but only dwells long enough for you to feel its impact. It's a serious film, but there's joy and bright colors when need be and boundless creativity in the set pieces (and my God does Be Prepared play as a lot more sinister after the past several years in this country).It doesn't need to explain why animals who would normally be prey for ravenous lions hang with them, because it has this dimension where things are precisely, comfortably and when necessary harrowingly metaphorical. The filmmakers and animators and storyboard artists have such a solid base for a story that the character work takes center stage: I love animation that is this expressive and soulful, and the director's know that as much as the lines may convey intentions and feelings, sometimes what isn't said speaks even louder (look at Scar and Simba's faces and eyes for like every second they are on screen, some of the best film acting of the decade).I'm glad I still love this movie. Of course there are some seams (its obvious to me now where Jim Cummings came in on Prepared to step in when Jeremy Irons broke his voice on the song), and the comic relief isn't as funny as in Aladdin or Great Mouse Detective from that golden age. But it's powerful and it's a strong example of how cinema can elevate problematic politics (how Mufasa explains the Circle of Life is... hmm...)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
The best Disney animated film ever...,"The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! My personal favorite character is Rafiki, the Baboon! I still cant forget the line he says to Simbe, ""Past can hurt, but as I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it!"" it is so true! i loved Zazu's weirdness, and shenzi's humor, above all, i loved Pumba's innocence and Timon's intelligence! In short, i found the film the best film ever... The voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justice to Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dad anyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, its meant to teach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great ""Circle Of Life"".

The Lion King: 9/10,"Released Christmas Day in 2002 to IMAX and large format screens, The Lion King makes a triumphant return to the screen after eight years. Its every bit as majestic and great as it has been before.The Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) just had a baby cub named Simba. All of the animals come to the ceremony, except for Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons). Scar desperately wants to be King, but can't. As long as Mufasa and Simba are there. Soon Simba is able to walk and talk and is voiced by Jonathon Taylor Thomas. After hearing about an elephant graveyard from Scar, he and his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) visit it. They meet three bumbling hyenas: Banzai (Cheech Marin), Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), and Ed (Jim Cummings), but they manage to leave unhurt. Scar is upset that the hyenas didn't do the job, so he orders a stampede to wipe out both of them, but it only takes care of Mufasa. Scar convinces Simba that he killed Mufasa, not Scar. So Simba flees into exile.The Lion King really benefits from the larger screen. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more, and you can really savor the animation. Disney didn't need any humans, so they could spend all of the time on a great story and lush landscapes. In fact, its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part of the pride of lions.The music boomed and really created the atmosphere. Although I had seen this picture before, I still was tense because of the way the music played out. Most of the time, I would just roll my eyes at the attempt to make me nervous. But Hans Zimmer's music really bowled me over and made my heart do calisthenics. Unlike such new Disney pics like Lilo and Stitch, the songs actually did some good. They took you out of a somewhat dreary mood and put a smile on your face and made your feet want to tap along. There were only a few, but they were very entertaining. And the Circle of Life song at the beginning was beautiful, with its perfect pictures and perfect sound.I really like James Earl Jones (he's pretty diverse), and this time was no exception. He seemed to act like he didn't want to do this role, but he couldn't contain his excitement for wanting to do voice-overs again (he had done some work in The Simpsons before). Matthew Broderick redeemed himself for me (after the atrocious Ferris Bueller's Day Off) by showing a strong voicing as the adult Simba. Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jim Cummings really had good chemistry together, even though they didn't have much screen time. Irons was really good and creepy as Scar (one of those who you can't help but hate), and if that is him really singing, brava!Be warned, The Lion King isn't really for youngsters. It had intense thematic elements that should have warranted a PG, instead of those that don't deserve it (Lilo and Stitch, again). The mood that the music and the script brought out could damper your day, so be warned.This is one movie where you can feel for the characters. You don't say `haha, he's dead', you say `Gasp! I'm so sad!' If it weren't for the gifted scriptwriters, this movie would be kaput and a nothing, not the best Disney movie ever made.The Lion King is a majestic movie, not without humor, that is for almost all to see.My rating: 9/10Rated G for intense thematic elements.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Its a 10,"""The best movie I ever watched in any form or any in language"".No, I am not exaggerating! It is the best movie ever, whether in human form or in animated. I can't find a single flaw in The Lion King (1994). Someone could argue that the story is not original, Disney just twisted it. Someone could also argue that i didn't watch that much of movies to judge ""The Best Ever"" but as I said, this the best movie I ever saw. The story is nice and free flowing and without any unnecessary bumpers. One can not recognized the voices behind the characters, because the characters are so prominent. Music! Let me say I am not very fond of English pop songs, but I could hum almost most of the songs of this movie, so I would say, music is that nice. Animation is superb, landscapes are eye catching, dialogues are sharp and comedy is at its best. What more might I say?Beside everything, you can say how crazy I am about this movie by my name.Enjoy the movie, don't leave the seat. Hakuna Matata!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"This is my sister's favourite film, and one of mine!","This is a fantastic movie, and I am not lying! my 13 year old sister loves this movie, and I can't fault this either. It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of African chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write like that. The best song is ""Can you feel the Love Tonight?"" but the others go without fault, ""Circle of Life"" is so spirit rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as Young Simba, and Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his booming voice to the majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide flawless comic relief. The vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar is up there with the best Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic, and you cry here a bit here as well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are actually two of the better DTV sequels.10/10.

"Very good, But not Disney's best like everyone claims","The Lion King is viewed by most as the peak in Disney's renaissance period and remains, to this date, the highest grossing 2D animated film of all time. With Disney on such a high expectations were, while this was increased by the superb vocal talent and wonderful animation, and for many those expectations were met. Though a lot are going to disagree with me, I have to come out and say that I think the film is kind of overrated. That doesn't mean I dislike it as a matter of fact I agree that it does have fantastic elements, but for the heaps of praise it gets I'm not sure if it holds up well enough.The story is effectively a toned down Hamlet. A lion prince named Simba is born, meaning that his cruel uncle Scar is now second in line to the throne. Scar plots to kill both King Mufasa and Simba, succeeding in killing Mufasa and making Simba believe he was at fault. Simba flees the kingdom and remains in exile for a number of years, until figures of the past challenge him and he must return home to take his rightful place as king. The story is a very interesting one, it is a much more mature than you would expect from Disney and I really enjoy it for that reason. Everything that happens seems to happen for a reason and there isn't any filler as far as the plot goes. After all this is a very big story and telling it in a cohesive mature manner works very well.The other impressive feature is the animation. It's clear that the animators put a lot of work in to create such a visually pleasing place for this to all happen in. The colours used give the place such a bright beautiful look and it is actually quite authentic looking too. Scenes of bird flying over the vivid landscape or of the sun shining over the land are so beautiful to look at. The character designs were also very good, like the contrast between the powerful Mufasa and the slimy Scar. The sheer scope of things is another wonderful aspect, such as when Scar's paw first comes down or the later Wildebeest stampede. Even things like the backgrounds look massive which gives an extra size to this world.The characters are rather hit and miss. Simba is a bit of a bland lead, he is just a kid for most of it but he does come off as a bit too boring and even obnoxious at times. He doesn't get any better the older he gets and Matthew Broderick's voice only adds to the dullness. Mufasa is just a brilliant character. He is designed wonderfully, has some really interesting characteristics and James Earl Jones' booming voice is perfect for it. A lot of people rate Scar as a top villain yet for me he's just decent. He is enjoyably devious and Jeremy Irons clearly has fun with the role, but he does come off as not that smart and a bit snivelling in the end. Zazu is very funny with Rowan Atkinson delivering some good lines and Rafiki is also very likable for coming across as a good friend. I'm not a big fan of Timon and Pumbaa as they come off as a bit annoying and wink at the camera too much, though they do have some amusing scenes. The Hyenas were daft but entertaining, while I think Nala was underplayed too much.I do have issues with the film. The message that it is trying to get across is an interesting one in how we must learn from the past to move forward. The problem is that when Simba confronts his past nobody believes him until Scar says what really happened. Looking at this you can't help but feel Simba would have been better off lying and that harms the whole point of the message. Also I think a lot of the comedic elements feel very misplaced. For a story as grand and serious as this I can't help but find that the comedy is too trivial at times which is distracting. As mentioned Timon and Pumbaa just feel a bit misplaced because they're jokes are slightly too silly. If done well, like with Zazu or the hyenas antics, then its nice relief but otherwise it doesn't work.Also I really find that the songs are a mixed bag. 'I Just Can't Wait to be King' and 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' just come off as your typical pop songs and there isn't anything truly catchy or memorable about them. 'Hakuna Matata' is another one everyone loves, but for me it's just annoying. On the other hand however, 'Circle of Life' is a brilliantly grand number that opens the film perfectly and 'Be Prepared' is really catchy with some very enjoyable singing from Jeremy Irons.Elsewhere there are some really memorable sequences here. The circle of life opening is something that everyone should remember, the wildebeest chase is visually stunning as well as pulse-pounding, Simba talking to Mufasa in the clouds is sadly beautiful and the final battle sequence does have some great images. Also I thought it was very brave decision to actually show the body of Mufasa after his death. In fact going on from that the movie does have a very strong emotional core running throughout that is very welcoming and smartly used.On the whole I do think that The Lion King is a very accomplished piece from Disney, I just don't find it as engaging as most people do. This is a big story with a lot of big elements, I just find that whilst most of the work some of them aren't quite as successful. I do wish other Disney films were as acclaimed as The Lion King, but I still find an entertaining and well-made film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"A dazzling, joyous piece of film-making","Of all the animation classics from the Walt Disney Company, there is perhaps none that is more celebrated than ""The Lion King."" Its acclaim is understandable: this is quite simply a glorious work of art.""The Lion King"" gets off to a fantastic start. The film's opening number, ""The Circle of Life,"" is outstanding. The song lasts for about four minutes, but from the first sound, the audience is floored. Not even National Geographic can capture something this beautiful and dramatic. Not only is this easily the greatest moment in film animation, this is one of the greatest sequences in film history.The story that follows is not as majestic, but the film has to tell a story. Actually, the rest of the film holds up quite well. The story takes place in Africa, where the lions rule. Their king, Mufasa (James Earl Jones) has just been blessed with a son, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), who goes in front of his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) as next in line for the throne. Scar is furious, and sets in motion plans to usurp the throne for himself. After a tragedy occurs and Mufasa is killed, Scar persuades Simba to flee, leaving himself as king. Simba grows up in exile, but he learns that while he can run away from his past, he can never escape it.When viewing the film, it is obvious that ""The Lion King"" is quite different from its predecessors (and successors). This is an epic story that contains more dramatic power than all the other Disney films combined. While there are definitely some light-hearted moments, there is no denying the dark drama that takes up the bulk of the story. While it could be argued that Disney is the champion of family entertainment, this film is not for the very young. Some of the sequences are very dark and violent, many bordering on frightening, even for the older crowd.The voice actors are terrific. Jonathan Taylor Thomas brings a large dose of innocence to Young Simba. He's mischievous, but also terribly naive. His older counterpart, voiced by Matthew Broderick, equals him. He's older, but no less mature. The voices are so similar that it's almost impossible not to believe that they are the same character at different ages. Perhaps no one could have been better suited for the role of Mufasa than James Earl Jones. His baritone voice gives the Mufasa a quality of great power and wisdom; there is no question that his role is king. As Scar, Jeremy Irons is pitch-perfect. The drawing of the character is villainous, but Irons' vocal work complements the animation to create one of the most memorable, and vicious, villains in Disney history. He's unquestionably evil, but he's also clever, which makes him all the more dangerous. Manipulation, not violence is his greatest weapon. Providing some much needed comic relief are Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts (a meerkat and a warthog), and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. While there is definite fun from these characters, neither the actors nor the filmmakers allow them to go over-the-top and destroy the mood of the film.Disney's animated features are known for their gorgeous artwork. Nowhere is this more apparent than in ""The Lion King."" Every single frame is jaw-dropping. The colors are rich, and the drawings are sharp and beautiful. One of the pitfalls of animation (both computer and hand-drawn) is that there is sometimes a visible distance between the subject and the background, making it seem as if the figure animation was cut and pasted on the background (this is obviously what happens, but it is up to the artists to make sure that it isn't noticeable). There is none of that here.Throughout the Golden Age of Disney animation, the films have been musicals. ""The Lion King"" is no different, and the songs are brilliant. All of the numbers are standouts (""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" won the Oscar, but in my opinion, ""The Circle of Life"" was better). In the cases of Simba and Nala (Simba's girlfriend), both young and old, there is a noticeable difference between the speaking and singing parts (everyone else does their own singing and speaking), but never mind. It still works, and that's what's important.""The Lion King"" is not flawless, but on first viewing, they aren't noticeable, and it is likely that the young won't ever notice them. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was the first animated film to get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (it lost to ""The Silence of the Lambs""), and is thus far the only animated film to receive such an honor. That being the case, it's hard to understand why ""The Lion King"" was not given the same distinction. The two films are more or less equal in quality, and the nominees for the honor that year were not strong.If you haven't already, see ""The Lion King."" You won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Would you believe its dated!,"The Lion King made a big splash when it was released in the mid-90's. I missed it then, but saw it recently because of my 3 yr old son. I've also seen other animated-family comedies like Shrek, Finding Nemo and Ice Age in recent weeks. Given the leaps in digital technology achieved in the past decade, The Lion King looks very dated. The animation and colors are not as realistic and vivid as 21st century Pixar-Disney offerings.This is basically a child-friendly take on the Hamlet tale with Denmark replaced by the African jungle and people replaced by lions, and other animals, notably a parrot, hyenas etc. The Elton John soundtrack is still quite good, with The Morning Report and Hakuna Matata standing out. The dialogue is not nearly as witty as that of Ice Age or Nemo but still appealing for kids. We have James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons voices for two vital characters, and both have magnificent voices for animated movies.

Very overrated,"I find many people describe this film with extreme fondness. I watched it again today after not watching it since I was a child, maybe a little over ten years ago. I really cannot believe the big fuss and when I read reviews on here to see what everyone loved about it I couldn't really find anything and to be honest it just seemed that everyone was stating the obvious 'the songs,' which were the only terrific thing about the entire film, and the fact that they 'loved it as a child,' but children love what everyone else loves, can you really point out something that can really be admired? Do people not consider the incoherence of the plot? I have seen many reviewers see the film as I do, and they tend to point out the things that people don't seem to realise, such as the extremely annoying characters and the fact that the characters are almost... scrambled-like throughout. It's hardly a story. And I know you could say well maybe I liked it as a child because it is a child's film but as many people have stated it is not - because of the violence and depression. What irritated me most is how the film makes you feel sad at the death of Simba's father, yet Simba himself just runs away and almost immediately seems to feel indifferent towards the situation! He just DOESN'T care! He starts singing hakuna matata for goodness sake!!I struggle to see why this film is so loved.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

A Modern Classic,"The Lion King is by general consensus the greatest Disney film from their glorious renaissance period (1989-1999), and is undoubtedly worthy of such recognition. Notably, it is the highest rated Western animation on IMDb's own Top 250, which while flawed and imprecise is a good indicator of quality.A loose adaption of Shakespeare's Hamlet, The Lion King is visually stunning, the peak of hand-drawn animation, with a strong voice cast and a wide selection of memorable tunes. It is a tight ~80 minutes, and one sometimes forgets just how quick the movie moves, yet it does so deftly. The characters are well defined, and the arc of Simba's growth, the core of the film, evolves satisfyingly. One could question whether more time should have been spent on Simba's growth in the middle act (there is incredulous imagery as Simba grows exponentially next to the stasis of Timon and Pumba), but to meander so would ask it to be an entirely different film.While it is not uncommon for a side character or two overshadow the main (see the Genie in Aladdin), Matthew Broderick and Jonathan Taylor Thomas (adult and young Simba respectively) are at risk from nearly all of the phenomenal cast. James Earl Jones is a commanding presence, and Jeremy Irons as Scar steals every scene. The 'fools' of the film, be it Timon & Pumba, the Hyena trio or even Zazu, all provide the levity believably, that would otherwise leave an incredibly sombre film. Nala is powerful, though one must note that she seems at times far more capable than Simba to actually achieve anything. Nevertheless, Simba's coming-of-age arc, while predictable, is enjoyable, helped along by fantastic charisma and choice songs.The fact that the film has spawned a wildly successful musical gives a strong indication of the quality of the music, but what is less said is how beautiful the film is. As The Lion King was being released, works were already moving away from hand-drawn animation, with Toy Story released a year later. And The Lion King might be the peak of hand-drawn, with an enormous palate of creativity and variety. The opening vista for 'Circle of Life', the bursts of colour in 'Can't wait to be King' and the sombre tone of 'Be Prepared' all are gorgeous. Yet, special mention must go to the Stampede scene, one of the finest scenes of animation ever.One thing I've developed from multiple viewings is how Timon and Pumba might be the weakest part of the movie. First, their 'life lessons' are essentially reversed by Rafiki. Certainly they are qualified to the point of being narratively sidelined. They feel contrived and even a detraction from the meat of the movie. Their role is the fast food portion of the film- the quick fix over more meatier bits of the film. The entertainment provided is enjoyable regardless, and is essential to round off the movie as Disney.The Lion King is endlessly re-watchable, catchy, fun, while remaining a fantastic piece of cinema and an invaluable part of the Disney canon.

There is a lot to like about this classic but not necessarily Simba.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
A milestone in cartoon story-telling.,"I believe that a great movie is one that clearly conveys a strong message. One that you can use to justify your views on various topics. Only a hand full of movies delivered the aforementioned attribute as well as The Lion King. Although this film's plot is enough to prove its brilliance, factors like voice-acting, background themes, dialogs, etc give an attentive viewer more to be impressed with. Case in point: James Earl Jones's voice boosted Mufasa's powerful appearance. The voice had a commanding tone which rivaled Mufasa's powerful roar. Likewise, there are many details that can make this movie the face of Disney. It has been more than 10 years since its release, and it still boasts a strong stance against far more graphically advanced movies. Kids as well as adults can enjoy this flick, possibly without snacks. I rate this film a ten out of ten while suggesting that everyone watch it at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

good,"The Lion King, a beloved classic in the world of animation, is a film with remarkable strengths and a few notable weaknesses. Its strength lies in the timeless music and visually stunning African landscapes that captivate viewers. The voice acting, led by James Earl Jones as Mufasa, is undeniably powerful and emotionally resonant. However, despite its memorable moments, the film occasionally suffers from pacing issues and lacks the depth of character development found in some of Disney's other classics. While it may not quite reach the pinnacle of perfection, The Lion King earns its 6/10 rating as an enjoyable and visually captivating journey into the Circle of Life, cherished by audiences for generations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Wonderful Music and Rhythms,"This is an outstanding work of animation. I realize that it has been criticized for political incorrectness. The fact of the matter is that it has strong female characters as well as male, and it's about a vision of monarchy. I have the greatest respect for female role models but I really don't see this as a worthy criticism. It's a great story of defeat and betrayal and renewal. It has delightful individual characters, dressed up to show their beings in a clever way. It has the most despicable villains with Scar and the Hyenas. It has the Henry II thing about duty. It doesn't glorify fooling around as one of my colleagues told me. The free life is OK but at some time you must follow your heart and redeem yourself. The music is outstanding; another triumph or the Disney team. There are three or four numbers that are so critical to a complete understanding of the events of the story. The sound effects person should have been rewarded because sound is so critical in this. From the stampede to the forbidden areas of the kingdom. I watched this about sixty times with my small children and never really tired of it. I would put this at the top of any list of animated adventures.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
The True Classic Disney Movie!,"This may be an unorthodox way to start a review, but hey it's as meaningful as i'll ever be for a review. My lucky number is 14. I was born on August 14th. My birth sign is Leo (Lion), my State Football Team is the Lions, and its been 14 years since i'v seen my favorite movie from my childhood; The Lion King for the first time. And now I had the honor to experience it in the theater.From the moment the black screen faded to the rising sun along on the African Plane, with opening Zulu lyrics playing to Circle of Life, I got chills up my spine and my lips were shaking as they were forming the biggest smile I think i'v ever had. Now of all the films to come out these past years like the final Harry Potter, Avatar, Inception, Super 8, Transformers, etc. I want make this clear; The Lion King was the funnest time i'v ever had at the Movies! I don't even care for it being part of the 3D effect.I wanted to see it in the theater as if it was the opening weekend back in 1994. It's still The Lion King, but in a sentimental way (If your a 90's kid) it makes you completely feel dropped back into your seat like it's was the first time viewing it. The story of a young lion prince, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Matthew Broderick) framed into killing his father Mufasa (James Earl Jones) by his evil uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons). Then flees from his past and meets Timon (Nathan Lane) and Pumba (Ernie Sabella) whom teach him ""Hakuna Matata"" (Literally meaning No Worries). And in the end Simba returns to be the one true king. The story may be considered Hamlet with lions, but it's so much more than that. Most in part of the fun characters, humor, and still having the true drama and emotion that makes The Lion King what it is.The 3D added depth to the film and actually didn't give me a headache. Zazu flying overhead Pride Rock, the music sequences, and the stampede scene are better than ever, yet I'm sure the new generation seeing it will probably be emotionally scarred for life. I don't want to be a ""Lion King is the Best Disney Movie Ever"" Guy without mentioning it has a flaw. Which is its quick resolve with the last 40 minutes of the movie. Yeah, Simba is intervened by his old childhood friend Nala and crazy shaman blue butt monkey Rafiki to go back home from his 'time away from home' that almost feels like the 10 second log scene in Hakuna Matata. In any way it still doesn't turn you away.Then add the key ingredient to a classic Disney Movie; Songs! Just another element that adds to the formula. Elton John and Tim Rice won an Oscar for their work on this film! And who's to say they don't deserve it? Circle of Life, Just Can't Wait to be King, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, Can You Feel the Love Tonight, and even Timons Hula Song! It took every bone in my body not to sing in the theater but hey, now there's another reason for multiple viewings. I want to say to those who are curious, there is no ""Morning Report"" song in the film! Disneys Classic 2D Animated films are true Disney.Disney mixed meaningful and powerful themes with maximum entertainment in a perfect way that are what make true classics. Today any critic from the New York Times can slap a comment on a movie saying it's a ""classic"" when really they can't say in 10 years people will be talking about it. But hey, Hakuna Matata! In the end if you want a luxury of seeing (Arguably) Disneys best film on the big screen than don't hold back. It will really make you feel like a kid for an hour and a half, and also give you witness to Disneys most beautiful masterpiece that isn't just Dinsey's Best, but possibly one of the greatest achievements ever made.....The Lion King!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Exciting original story from Disney.,"This movie's story was written solely by Disney Studios, about a young lion, Simba, who was forced into exile by his evil Uncle Scar, who wants to take control of the jungle before Simba claims it. Life in the jungle declines under Scar's rule as Simba abandons his identity and meets new friends, Timon and Pumbaa, in another part of the jungle.Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff directed an exciting movie, adopting more of what I think are some of mainstream Hollywood's intense drama and comedy styles, seen in such parts like Uncle Scar and his crafty hyena goons chasing away poor Simba like gangsters pursuing a helpless hero, and the parts of the more modern day jokes and punchlines made by Timon and Pumbaa. The movie is also full of drama and action that will attract an audience of all ages, providing a great source of entertainment. It is compelling to see how Simba tries to wrestle his way out of his doubts as he tries to find his true identity and compelling to see Simba's family try to overcome adversary under Scar's rule. This is also a powerful story about courage, duty and identity (noticable as Simba tries to find his way) and the importance of family.Hans Zimmer did a good job on the music score and Elton John wrote some memorable songs like ""Circle of Life"" and ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight."" The toe-tapping ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"" is my favorite.The characters are likable and, like the plot's style, take on more of a mainstream Hollywood approach. This movie differs from the more earlier films such as ""Cinderella"" and ""The Jungle Book,"" and even the later films such as ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast."" ""The Lion King"" doesn't have that Disney touch you've come to expect and love in many of the fairytale and adventure movies, signaling that Disney films have evolved immensely over time. Even though it's not one of the more conventional Disney films, ""The Lion King"" is still a very good movie to watch due to its original concept, captivating story and memorable characters.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
The Greatest Disney Film Ever Made,"This is the most incredible movie I have ever seen. Sounds silly? It may, considering it is an animated film which a majority of people don't take seriously when in the subject of the greatest movies anyone has ever seen. I personally love animated anything, whether it be cartoons, movies, shorts, etc. The Lion King *IS* the king of all Disney films. We all know the tragic tale of the death of Simba's father, even if we had not seen the movie, thus recognition and praise this movie receives absolutely deserves it no less. This is my favourite movie. The art is simply fantastic. The animation is just breathtaking. The story -- though based off of 'Hamlet' -- is beautiful and will leave you in tears. The voice actors and actresses did an impeccable job for each of the characters' personalities. I especially adore the music. The Lion King had introduced me to African music and I have loved it ever since. The songs in the movie such as ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" (one sung by Elton John, and one sung by Kristle Edwards along with the voices of adult Simba and Nala, both pieces of which I love and listen to everyday) and ""Hakuna Matata"" are divine and catchy, not to mention adorable.I cannot say how much I love this film. I'm in love with it. The producers and directors and every person who had contributed to the making of it did a marvelous job. Overall, this movie is PERFECT.

The Lion King roars on!,"I first heard of this wonderful Disney feature when I popped in the Aladdin tape, and I knew it was going to be my favorite. A year later, I saw it in a theatre as a double feature paired with Angels in the Outfield. It was so good I did not want to see it come to an end. I begged to see it again and I got my chance at a library and it was just as mesmerizing. I finally got it on video and to this day it never fails to impress. With gorgeous animation, memorable characters, unbelievable score, and a well thought out story with a great message for anyone of any age (""We are all connected in the the great circle of life"", said Mufasa), what's not to like? My favorite song is Hakuna Matata (of course!) but I have many of these songs stuck in my head from time to time.

Even though I was only three i never forget the film, I never cried at the sad points of the film and no i never really fully understood it until i watch it a few years later but i always remembered Simba's realisation that his life would never be the same.If you haven't seen the lion king *slap in the face* believe me you are missing what i describe as the last Disney film old Walt would be proud of. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

The Lion King 3D: a reissue that feels like a new release,"For Disney The Lion King really is the cat that got the cream. Since the original film opened 17 years ago the film has taken $4.6 billion worldwide and has spawned one of the most successful shows in Broadway history.With such success one could be forgiven for thinking that the film's new release in 3D was just Disney finding a way of milking a successful franchise. Yet with The Lion King it doesn't feel this way.The story deserves to be told again for a new audience. Those who grew up with this film will perhaps now have children of their own, or merely want to escape back to their childhood. Either way The Lion King has aged well, the story is as compelling, as emotional and as funny as ever.This stems from its characters, the story's moral heart and the performances which bring it all to life. Watch any other Disney film and you will struggle to find a character as evil as Scar, nor a scene as moving as Simba's last with his father Mufasa. The cast including Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, Matthew Broderick and Rowan Atkinson deliver each line with relish.Yet at the risk of stating the obvious, it is Hans Zimmer's soundtrack and Elton John/Tim Rice's songs which really makes the film sing. People across the world may know the words to ""Hakuna Matata"", ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"" and ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight?"", but what's forgotten is how important they are to the story and how well the whole film fits together with its musical moments.However despite its status as a timeless classic 3D doesn't work particularly well with the 2D animations of old Disney films. For a start the characters still sing about a circle of life rather than a sphere. To be serious, if you watch this film expecting to have to cower to avoid a herd of wildebeest then you'll be disappointed.But the 3D does have its own charms, different to other 3D films. There is theatricality about this version of The Lion King that allows you to take in the beauty of the African backdrop whilst still focussing on the story front of stage. It makes each scene's colours more vibrant, stopping a brilliant story beginning to look visually tired and old.Despite the fact that The Lion King came out 17 years ago, watching this reissue feels like a new release. That is partly due to the facelift Disney has given it but really it is because it was such a good film in the first place. For that alone watching Simba's journey again is well worthwhile.Verdict:  With a story this good Disney could do little wrong and they haven't.For more reviews read http://www.theupcoming.co.uk",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Slimy But Satisfying,"Seeing the Lion King was my first cinema memory and honestly I remember more about diving under the seats and roaming around the aisles than the film itself. To see it again only now, centuries on, when so much of it has been culturally absorbed (and it's even spawned a shot-for-shot remake) is very bizarre. Not all of it works and you can clearly see the tell-tale tooth-marks of a script that's been chewed on for years by multiple people. The climactic ending scene feels weirdly truncated - but there are some strong performances and some still-stunning sequences here. I don't have as warm memories for this as I do for other 90s fare like Aladdin, but I can see why people love it like they do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Disneys best,"The lion king is one of my favourite movies of all time. It is possibly Disney's best movie and is one that any person of any age group will adore. My dad worked for Disney's video department and he got all the great Disney movies and of all of them the lion king is perhaps the best along with Aladdin and toy story. It has the worst Disney villain in the form of scar, has a truly touching story which captivates the watcher and has some of the best Disney characters to date. It won 2 Oscars one of them for best original song in the shape of ""can you feel the love tonight"". Personally i much prefferd and thought that ""the circle of life"" ""I just cant wait to be king"" or ""Hakuna Matata"". This is possibly the last great hand drawn Disney movie as well as toy story followed up a couple of years later.

The Lion King,"Certainly not one of Disney's better animations from a technical perspective - the artwork lacks the vibrancy and detail of many of their earlier stories; but the combined efforts of Sir Tim Rice, Elton John and Hans Zimmer make this an enjoyable fantasy adventure. It is told in two parts - the first sees a son ""Simba"" born to the king ""Mufasa""; a curious little fella who, alongside his friend ""Nala"" is inquisitive and mischievous - a real pain in the neck to the king's major-domo ""Zazu"". One fan the new cub really doesn't have, however, is the king's rather unimpressed brother ""Scar"" who hatches a plan to depose his brother and take over the kingdom. He manages to achieve exactly this and to get the youngster to blame himself and head off, alone, into exile. The second part is much more fun; he falls in with a warthog and is soon eating colourful grubs and living a peaceful, jolly life far from home. That idyllic existence is not to last long, however - ""Nala"" discovers he is still alive and races to alert him of the disaster that has befallen the kingdom under the rule of his uncle and his trusty band of hyenas. The musical numbers help it build to a gripping denouement, with clever, quite witty dialogue from some good - though not great - voice talents from the likes of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg to keep the pot boiling. It is an enjoyable film to watch but I wasn't captivated by it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
The Lion King is a Beautiful Film,"The Lion King is one of Disney's most beloved movies, being ranked as Disney's number one movie. For a movie produced in 1994, that is a huge accomplishment. Especially with the amount of movies Disney produces a year. A fun fact is that The Lion King is based on Shakespear's play, Hamlet. For those who have never seen The Lion King, the story follows a young lion cub who learns a very valuable lesson about what it truly takes to be king while facing his villain uncle as his enemy who yearns for the throne. He learns a lot along the way about taking accountability, responsibility, love, and growing up. I love this movie for a multitude of reasons, a few being the loveable characters, the songs, the message, and the nature of the story itself.The characters are perhaps the most memorable part of this movie. Many amazing actors such as Mathew Broderick, James Earl Jones, and Nathan Lane really bring these characters to life. For me, the ideal character is one that is memorable and I can safely say, almost every character in The Lion King, is incredibly memorable. The characters are portrayed as animals which definitely adds to that lovable nature as most people find animals utterly adorable. This movie's animation is another reason the characters set this move apart from any other because they are animals but have very expressive faces, allowing emotion to come through very well. Throughout the movie, we get to see several versions of these characters as they grow and the plot thickens. The characters are what I like to call, the heart of the film. They are the ones delivering some of Disney's most iconic lines, singing Disney's most loved songs, and telling the story of The Lion King. Without Simba, Timon, Pumba, Nala, etc, we wouldn't get so attached to this movie.A key part of many of Disney's most beloved movies is the catchy music. If you are like me, you have caught yourself singing along to The Lion King's amazing soundtrack while doing chores. The best Disney songs are catchy and are remembered for how well they assisted in telling a story. For The Lion King specifically, all of the songs were composed by Elton John and the lyrics written by Tim Rice. These songs have not only very catchy lines, but a lot of heart and soul. I have been guilty in that I have definitely cried when the song Can You Feel The Love Tonight starts playing. It adds so much to the story. Try to imagine what The Lion King would be like without Hakuna Matata or I Just Can't Wait to be King. The music adds magic and storytelling to the film. Each song allows the plot to move further and gives it depth. We learn a lot about each character through the songs they sing. We learn Scar's true intentions through his song Be Prepared, which is one of the greatest villain songs within the Disney universe. Another example is that we see Timon and Pumba's personalities and how they feel about life through their song, Hakuna Matata. The music in The Lion King truly gives the movie so much as the movie just wouldn't be the same without it.As many of the most memorable films, The Lion King has a beautiful message that really sets the movie apart from any other regular Disney movie. I feel a good message of a movie is one that the viewer takes with them when they are done watching. Perhaps something that changes the viewers perception of themselves or the world. The overall message of The Lion King is finding the balance of harmony in the world. There are of course smaller messages such as finding one's true identity or accepting responsibility. Simba's father Mufasa tried to instill in him that everything breathing and living, is a part of everyone's story and that if there is balance and harmony, it is a seamless circle of life. We see this at a few different points throughout the movie. When Mufasa was king, there was balance and harmony amongst the animals. But we see a shift when Simba doesn't accept his responsibility and stand up against his Uncle, Scar. I feel this is a beautiful message that again, can be interpreted in different ways. This movie is the perfect example of a perfect message chosen for a movie. Everyone watching The Lion King, is able to take this with them when the movie is over, whether that is the importance of creating a balance in a friend group, relationship, or environment. Without such a moving message for this film, I don't believe it would have direction. The message is what is driving the movie forward as the characters go on their journey, interact and learn.Lastly, the storyline. For me, the ideal storyline is one that is cohesive, easy to follow, entertaining, and shows the characters growing as time goes on. This movie checks all of those boxes. The storyline of The Lion King, as stated before, is based on one of Shakespeare's most popular works, Hamlet. Of course adding its own twists and creative liberties, it is very interesting to see how Disney portrayed this story. This story in particular has a lot of room for characters to learn and grow which is a huge part of The Lion King as a whole. The main purpose of the movie is to allow the viewer to see Simba, grow older and learn lessons while on his journey. I think the story is what holds all of the other elements together. It gives the characters, songs, and message a purpose. The storyline has everything. It has romance, mild violence, betrayal, hilarious sidekicks, talking animals, and everything in between.I love this movie with all of my heart. It is very nostalgic for me as my family was always a huge Disney family. We loved watching all of the movies and The Lion King was always our favorite. I truly can not think of a flaw in this movie as it has everything a viewer could ever want. The Lion King is a masterpiece and will always be the most memorable movie for me and many others who have had the privilege to watch. Every element was carefully thought out and portrayed on the screen beautifully.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Most of Scar's scenes were worth watching.

"No bad, but it could be a lot better.","The Lion King isn't a bad film. It just doesn't have anything unique and the songs are annoying as hell. The story also has a ton of stuff that isn't explained. Why doesn't Scar kill young Simba after killing Mufassa. Why does Nala travel all the way to where Simba was living with Timon and Puamba. Why is there a drought, famine, and bad weather when Scar rules. There are like all these animals, so why don't they overthrow Scar. When Simba returns to face his actions, no one supports him until he finds out he didn't kill his father. Why does the land turn back to normal after Simba returns. This is probably the most overrated Disney film, but not the worst.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
One of Disney's greatest movies,"A young lion cub named Simba is born, knowing that he will be the future king of the jungle. But after he is tricked into thinking that he killed his own father, the young cub runs away and goes into exile. When he grows older, he is forced to come back.It's pretty much common knowledge that Lion King is one of the best movies Disney has ever made. It embodies everything that makes Disney so great – excellent story, great characters, strong soundtrack, and a very capable cast of actors lending their voices.For me, the story is the best thing. Hamlet is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, and the writers have done a great job of transferring that to the animal kingdom. The scene between Simba and the ghost of Mufasa, in particular, is very emotional and tugs at the heart-strings. I'm surprised that the film was as short as it was, to be honest, I think it could have been fleshed out a little more. But what we do get is great.Simba also probably ranks up there as one of Disney's greatest creations. It is a brilliantly-crafted character, very well-voiced by Matthew Broderick. As a kid, I remember how beloved Timon and Pumbaa were, but I didn't really see the appeal. Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Jeremy Irons) are also very good. Coincidentally, 'The Lion King' marks the first time a major Disney character dies, which once again re-establishes the strength of the story.My only gripe with this movie is probably just the length. A little more time and the film could have been even better. But between the emotion, the brilliant songs ('Circle Of Life' is my personal favourite) and the fun characters, you have a classic. Not just a Disney classic, but a cinema classic.I'll stop masturbating now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

An impressive animated movie.,"""The Lion King"" is and will always will be regarded as one of the better Disney movies. And it deserves that!First of all the movie looks visually splendid! The African land scape's are beautiful and so are the animations of the animals itself.What makes ""The Lion King"" such a special movie is the emotional dept the story has. The story plays a significant role in the movie and it has some good adult moments. The entire movie has a more of an adult feeling, unlike earlier made Disney's that mainly focused on only young children. Still there also is plenty to enjoy for the young ones, especially the characters Timon and Pumbaa shall be loved by them.The story is filled with symbolism and reference to mainly the communist regime.The voice cast is good, mainly of course thanks to James Earl Jones who has an amazing good deep voice. Also the three hyenas are voiced perfectly by Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings. Jeremy Irons who voices the main villain Scar really brings his character to live and makes the movie even more worth watching.There are some typical Disney songs that are good. Also surprising good is the musical score itself composed by Hans Zimmer who also received an Oscar for it. His first and only one but hopefully not his last. Also Tim Rice and Elton John received an Oscar for the song "" Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" and were nominated for two other songs from this movie.A must see animated movie with some scene's and songs that you'll not easily forget.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

I cannot stress just how good this film is. Without a doubt the peak of Disney and to this day they have not made anything this original and so influential.

Not feeling the love tonight,"Difficult to deny the worldwide success of this Disney animated musical from which already has sprung a sequel, a theatrical show and now, we hear a live-action remake in the near future. And yet watching it for the first time, I'd be lion sorry, lying if I said I thought it was top drawer Disney. I've liked Elton John's music too for many years too but again didn't feel the songs he contributed (with Tim Rice as his lyricist) were his best work even if it did give his career an unexpected boost at the time.So what's not to like...well I struggled a little to side with the ruling Mafusa who when asked why it was okay for lions to eat antelopes, lamely proffered the line that lions turn back into grass when they die which then feeds the antelopes as part of the circle of life...that's not my understanding about evolution in the animal kingdom, where I thought survival of the fittest was the raison d'etre.I know the film is almost 25 years old but I also thought the animation quality wasn't of the highest while the characters repeat stock situations and emotions which Disney still peddles today, i.e. rebellious youngster leaves home before returning to heroically save the day against big bad baddie, in this case Simba's uncle Scar. Oh and of course there are cute side-attractions a-plenty, like the meerkat that thinks it's Groucho Marx, his less-than-sharp wild boar sidekick that definitely isn't a pig and a witch doctor funky gibbon all helping Simba in some way or other. I didn't really think the hyenas who support Scar were especially malevolent either.Maybe I'm just an old stick-in-the-mud but I just didn't think ""The Lion King"" lived up to expectations.

Not just some love story,"The Lion King is about a young cub, Simba, who is destined to be king of his animal kingdom. But his Uncle Scar has something to say about that since he's second in line for the throne. To prevent Simba from getting the throne, he kills Simba's father, Mufasa, and drives Simba out of the kingdom. Simba then meets Timon and Pumba who tell him ""Hakuna Matata"", no worries. But when Simba's old friend, Nala, comes to see him as an adult and tells him that Scar has destroyed the kingdom, Simba must confront his past and Scar to win back the throne!I believe this movie was a great tribute to all animation, and something that every movie should hope to accomplish. This movie I think is better than any other Disney movie simply because it is more ""real"" than any other one. It also has a lot more catchy music than films like Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. One thing that really gets me mad is the whole ""too intense for young children"" thing that's been said about this movie for the past 13 years. Little kids can deal with death, they probably don't even understand it. This movie i think really has mostly cheerful moments mixed in with a ""real"" story. Not just some love story with problems. It contains everything from romance to action, from happiness to sadness. You cannot get enough of this film. Disney sure has done a great job on this film and it truly deserves the title ""A Masterpiece."" It seems that animated motion pictures nowadays lack the true epic quality that makes am movie memorable and try to make up for that lacking in weird attempts at modern comedy that appeals to a young audience.

A Perfect Movie.,"No internet review is going to tell you how great The Lion King is, because even if you haven't seen it, the process of cultural osmosis means you already KNOW how great it is. (And seriously, how many people in the year of our lord 2024 HAVEN'T seen this film, even talking globally).No one needs to spell out how incredible this film is. How it, along with an unbroken streak of excellence starting with 1989's The Little Mermaid and continuing throughout the 90s, basically brought Disney back from the dead and into a level of cultural relevancy not seen since the mid 20th century.What I will say about The Lion King is that the more you watch it, the more you realize how special it is and how nitpicky you need to be to really find faults with it. It's so good, it feels effortless. It manages to touch upon immortal themes of kinship, destiny, responsibility, and power, but is just as entertaining for kids as it is for adults.Really, the best case for this movie is watching the 2019 ""live action"" version and just judging for yourself. When you see a copy of a masterpiece, the brilliance of the original is just so self-evident. Just watch this thing, if you haven't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Absolutely Amazing!!!,"This has grossed $987.5 million worldwide. Considering it a better movie than the Wild. Anyways, let's talk about the movie. In the Pride Lands of Africa, a lion rules over the animals as king. The birth of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's son Simba creates envy and resentment in Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, who knows his nephew now replaces him as heir to the throne. After Simba has grown into a young cub, Mufasa gives him a tour of the Pride Lands, teaching him the responsibilities of being a king and the Circle of Life. Later that day, Scar tricks Simba and his best friend Nala into exploring a forbidden elephant graveyard, despite the protests of Mufasa's hornbill majordomo Zazu. At the graveyard, three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai and Ed attack the cubs before Mufasa, alerted by Zazu, rescues them and forgives Simba for his actions. That night, the hyenas, who are allied with Scar, plot with him to kill Mufasa and Simba. The next day Scar lures Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there while he gets Mufasa. On Scar's orders, the hyenas stampede a large herd of wildebeest into the gorge. Mufasa rescues Simba, but as Mufasa tries to climb up the gorge's walls, Scar throws him back into the stampede, where he is trampled to death. After Simba finds Mufasa's body, Scar convinces him he was responsible for his father's death and advises Simba to flee the kingdom. As Simba leaves, Scar orders Shenzi, Banzai and Ed to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. That night, Scar announces to the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing a pack of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands. After running far away, Simba collapses from exhaustion in a desert. Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and a warthog, find him and nurse him back to health. Simba subsequently grows up with them in the jungle, living a carefree life with his friends under the motto ""hakuna matata"" (""no worries"" in Swahili). When he is a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reconcile and fall in love. Nala urges Simba to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a wasteland with not enough food and water. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off, leaving Nala disappointed and angry. As Simba exits the jungle, he encounters Mufasa's mandrill friend and adviser, Rafiki. Rafiki tells Simba that Mufasa is ""alive"" and takes him to a pond. There Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as the king of the Pride Lands. Simba realizes he can no longer run from his past and goes home. Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa join him, and agree to help him fight. At the Pride Lands, Simba sees Scar hit Sarabi and confronts him, but Scar taunts Simba over his ""part"" in Mufasa's death. However, when Scar pushes Simba to the edge of Pride Rock, he reveals that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba roars back up and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs Simba for mercy, insisting that he is family and placing the blame on the hyenas. Simba no longer believes Scar, but spares his life on the grounds of forever leaving the Pride Lands. Scar appears to comply, but then attacks his nephew. After a fierce fight, Simba throws his uncle off Pride Rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and eaten alive by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba ascends to the top of Pride Rock and takes over the kingdom as the rain falls again. Sometime later, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Simba looks down happily at his kingdom with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa by his side; Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the inhabitants of the Pride Lands, and the Circle of Life continues.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
The end of an era...,"The 32nd animated Disney classic is one of Disney's best known films. It is considered by many 'the best' of Disney. I don't agree with that, there are better films. But still, it is the last of a kind.I first saw it in the cinema in December 1994, with my parents, sister, godfather and his wife and kids. I was 10 at the time. It was in a cinema I used to go many times back then and which I first saw other Disney films, like 'Aladdin' and 'Beauty and the Beast', for example.The original 1994 version is the true version for me. The version with that dumb 'Morning Report' scene has no reason to exist and is completely unnecessary. Seriously, did they think that people were really gonna accept that? Aside that it's the same movie but why changing a movie, even if it's only for 1 minute?The beauty of the artwork is one of the film's best attributes. It shows us beautiful landscapes of Africa and includes, among other things, the gorgeous sunrises and sunsets characteristic of Africa. We know this takes place somewhere in Africa but we don't know where exactly. They call it ""Pride Lands"" in the film...The lions and lionesses are extremely well drawn and handsome and their roars are very realistic, so much that I wonder if they used real lions in stage or if it was very talented people roaring like that.Simba is very pretty and cute as a lion cub and grows looking similar to his father. Mufasa always fascinated me and even now he still fascinates me: he is a gorgeous lion, powerful, with an imposing and majestic figure, a strong voice, a brutal strength and an amazing physique. Mufasa really is a 'Sir Lion'.Scar is one of the great Disney villains and he really has that cold and harsh look on his face and eyes.Timon and Pumba are two goofy but funny characters. They are clearly stupid, but more of a comic relief than anything else. I don't particularly like the hyenas, but Ed is a funny one, perhaps for being a mute character like Dopey ('Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs') and Gideon ('Pinocchio'). It's hilarious when Ed laughs hysterically because of the way Mufasa scared them away.However, Mufasa's death is one of the most severe things for a child to watch and the sequence itself is depressing, easy to make some tears come to our eyes.As for the voice cast, talents vary, but some do an excellent job, like James Earl Jones as Mufasa, Jonathan Taylor Thomas as infant Simba, Jeremy Irons as Scar and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu.The soundtrack is great. It has two versions of 'Circle of Life' and 'Can you feel the love tonight'. In the case of 'Circle of Life', I like both versions. In the case of 'Can you feel the love tonight', I prefer Elton John's version.I also enjoy the songs 'Hakuna Matata', 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight', 'Be Prepared' and the silly song 'Asante sana squash banana', but I adore 'I Just Can't Wait To Be King' and those instrumental-vocal songs which resemble African sounds and at the same time they have this dark feeling in them.

The voice actors do a wonderful job, the score and several of the songs are very strong and have stood the test of time quite well.

I'm in the minority - I didn't like it,"'The Lion King' is a Disney animation about a lion cub named Simba who runs away from his responsibility after thinking that he is to blame for his father's fate. Along the way, Simba meets Timon and Pumba, the comical sidekicks. It's a sad film, but it is a film about life, and it is realistic in that sense. However, 'The Lion King' is probably my least favourite Disney animation. Although Timon and Pumba are supposed to provide the comic relief, I found the couple very annoying. Yes, this film had huge success in the 1990s, but I was never impressed with it. Most people seem to really enjoy this film, so I am probably in the majority for giving it a low rating, but I just did not think it was that good of a film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

An absolute classic,"This was Disney's B-movie production. The studio was convinced that the following year's ""Pocahontas"" was going to rake in the cash and the praise. However, armed with a story lifted from ""Hamlet"" and some of the all-time great Disney songs, ""The Lion King"" became the last great film to come out of Disney's hand-drawn animations, and the last in a golden era which included ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"". The young generation who grew up with this film have a level of affection for it that very few films have achieved. Their parents have a similar fondness for it. Now, some years on, that young generation can appreciate it as a family film once more with their children, but can also appreciate the superior level of craft which is in this film.From the breathtaking opening, the power of the songs is immediately apparent. ""The Circle of Life"" with the sun breaking across the plain is striking and iconic, for parent and child alike. The energy of ""I just can't wait to be king"" is contrasted with the scheming moodiness of ""Be Prepared"". ""Hakuna Matata"" is still adored and is delightfully witty (it has the most intelligent fart joke ever) and ""Can you feel the love tonight?"" is up there with ""Beauty and the Beast"" in the pantheon of great Disney love songs.The songs complement a story which is simple, effective and daring. Like many of the best Disney films, there is darkness here that the young viewer can deal with but gives the film added depth. The death of Mufasa can still bring the butchest teenager to tears. However, there is also a wealth of humour which ranges from intelligent and witty to absurd and hilarious (""What do you want me to do? Dress in drag and do the hula?""). Also, this is a proper story. The trials of Simba are thoroughly engaging and the world he finds himself in is richly populated by entertaining characters. The stand outs are the comic Timon and Pumbaa and Jeremy Irons's deliciously voiced villain, Scar (""I'm surrounded by idiots."").The film is also a fine example of technical class. It looks stunning – one of Disney's most beautifully drawn films – has a fine score by Hans Zimmer to accompany the award winning songs and was a major step forward in CG effects – the thrilling stampede sequence being almost entirely created in computers.This was a generation defining film, far superior and far more successful than ""Pocahontas"" (the VHS was the highest seller of all time). It was and is adored by millions. It has been somewhat forgotten, particularly after the advent of CG animation two years later with the magnificent ""Toy Story"". This film, however, deserves better as it is an undoubted classic to be enjoyed by young and old alike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

This movie has been a huge success for Disney. I think everyone should see him at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Hands down the most overrated Disney film, and one of the top ten most overrated films ever","Best film ever? Disney at its best? Animation's crowning achievement? Well, I'm sorry to bust 99% of the world's bubble, but this is an EXCEPTIONALLY overrated film that in the past I would have thought good, but now think of as easily the worst animated ""masterpiece"" ever made by Disney.It's plot is so weak, it can be summarized in at most one paragraph. Every moment is stretched as far as it can go, and more time is filled with irrevelant material, such as songs (which are some of the weakest ever created by Disney, but I'll get to that later) than with actual story. People claim this gives it an ""epic"" quality. The only way that this could possibly be true is through epic boredom.The characters are shallow and unmemorable. Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa, and the Hyenas are comic relief that are sorely missing comicality (If you want a truly great example of Disney's comical relief, look at the Genie and Iago from Aladdin, or Kronk and Kuzco from The Emperor's New Groove). Simba is an unadmirable hero who I couldn't care less about, and his love with Nala is anything but inexistent. Scar is one of the weakest of the modern Disney villains, and does not make you hate him like Gaston or impress you with his evil so much that you like him like Jafar. The only characters I can pass off as even half-decent are Rafiki and Mufasa.The music I will give merit to as being okay and somewhat enjoyable, but still, it isn't within a hundred miles of the attractive Arabian dances of Aladdin or the Broadway style melody of Beauty and the Beast or the fun Tropical tunes of The Little Mermaid. Only the Circle of Life (even I have to admit that the opening number is magnificent) is as good as any of the songs in the aforementioned films, and just barely. The rest are simply radio-friendly pop tunes.However, one thing I will stop at no ends to give this film credit for is its animation. I will say right now that no other Disney film has backgrounds so richly detailed or characters so well designed. Indeed, the art quality is definitely the most astounding ever created Disney. But art quality alone cannot save this movie from all its other weaknesses, and besides, art quality is probably the least important of the four major aspects of an animated film (the other three being story, characters, and, in the case of Disney, music).This movie does not deserve to be praised as if it is the best Disney can muster. The people who think this is true have probably never seen any truly great Disney films, or just can't realize one. Aladdin, for example, is in my opinion the greatest film, animated or otherwise, ever made (And I am a film buff, to those of you questioning my merits). Beauty and the Beast is in my top 10, and many others would probably crack my top 100. The Lion King, however, is depressingly mediocre, and deserves at most a 5. I give it a 2 only for the art quality.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

And of course, the jealousy and betrayal of Scar are themes that echo real life.And, of course, the fact that Simba and Nala have their own cub at the end is great.

"In June 1994, Disney unveiled what would become one of its most beloved animated titles, The Lion King.","From the stealthy array of talent selected to perform the voices, including such deep-tone stalwarts as James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons, one almost expects a tragedy in the Shakespearean tradition. And, in certain aspects, The Lion King does fit this bill. Instead of the house of Hanover or Stuart, the drama centers on the reign of the mighty lion Mufasa (Jones), the king of a perfectly balanced African kingdom of animals who thrive in stunning abundance. A beneficent monarch, Mufasa, raises his young male cub, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas, then Matthew Broderick as an adult) to know that ""we are all connected in the great circle of life.""But, even in this teeming ecosystem, there is rancor; Mufasa's avaricious younger brother, the dark lion Scar (Irons), plots to become king. He orchestrates a bloody internecine intrigue, killing Mufasa and sending the young Simba into exile in the wilderness.Essentially, The Lion King is a coming-of-age story as the young Simba grows and matures to a point where he is ready to reclaim his birthright and, more importantly, carry on the harmonious work of his father. While weighty in theme, and propelled by several remarkable moral lessons, The Lion King's screenplay (by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton) bursts along at a spectacular dramatic gait, nourished with light humor, tending romance and frisky escapades.Directors Roger Allen and Rob Minkoff, respectful of both the story's epic grandeur and personal power, have fashioned a radiantly multidimensional film.The crowning glories of The Lion King must be bestowed upon the legions of animators who contributed to its majestic, playful and glowing look. Composer Hans Zimmer's throbbing, percussive musical score also is a highlight, while the songs of Tim Rice and Elton John not only propel the plot but add cheerful zest to the splendid terrain of The Lion King. - Duane Byrge",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
An American Classic.,"The Lion King has always served as my all time favorite movie. It captures the childhood memories you long for as you continuously grow older.

The characters will leave your stomach hurting from the laughter produced, and the songs will have you singing. The animation is nothing to be overlooked, and its rather perfect nature will leave you in awe. There is no contest that this movie will forever remain a classic.

Still Pretty Good,"Watching this movie again ever since I was a child was quite a nostalgic experience for me.I always loved this movies soundtrack, the songs and hilarious comedy that Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella performance provided for Timon and Pumbaa.So I'll always have a soft spot for this movie as it brings me back to when I was a kid and singing Hakuna Matata. However, if I'm being honest with myself, I don't think this movie is incredible as others say it is in my opinion of course. However I do understand the praise and why so many people still talk highly about this movie.Personally, I do think the story is okay (Not amazing) and some of the characters are just not interesting to me like Scar.

The movie of my childhood!,"The Lion King is one of the remarkable movies of my childhood. The story follows Simba, a lion who must reclaim his rightful place as the lion king. I think the plot can be for all ages. When I was young, I had no problem following the story, but as an adult now, I can still enjoy the story. It's simple but fun.Looking back, another thing that makes the movie enjoyable for me is the animation. 2D frame-by-frame animation is one of my favorites. Nowadays, the newer animated movie tends to be more 3D or just don't have the same feeling as the older ones. Plus, I personally enjoy the animal cast in The Lion King because as a kid, I really like animals, so that's another thing I like about The Lion King compared to other classic movies.I also love the musical side of this movie as well. This movie features many of the ironic songs that we know today. I originally watched the movie in my native language version many times, obviously because I was young back then, so I was more used to those songs in my language, but when I got older and came back to watch it again, I also liked the original version of these songs, it has its charm whether what language it is!Overall, I think The Lion King is one of those timeless classic movies, it's definitely worth watching for both new audiences and repeat ones!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
The Greatest Disney Film Of All Time.,"One of the greatest films ever made, The Lion King is the very pinnacle of Disney's Renaissance Era that didn't just mark a creative high for the legendary animation studio but remains their most impressive work to date. An astounding masterpiece for all ages that's perfectly balanced in the smallest of aspects & still hasn't aged a day, this is without a doubt the greatest Disney film of all time.Set in the Pride Lands of Africa, The Lion King tells the story of a young lion prince who flees into exile after the death of his father when his uncle tricks him into believing that he is the one responsible for the king's demise. Growing up with two outcasts & embracing their carefree attitude, he is ultimately forced to confront his past after a chance encounter with an old friend & decides to return to his homeland.Directed by Roger Allers & Rob Minkoff, the film opens on such a grand note that its prologue alone is much better than most features turn out to be in their entire runtime. The whole story has an epic feel to it despite its grounded simplicity, the plot unfolds like a soothing breeze, the themes are handled with care, entertainment is top-notch and its carefully carved out characters add even more richness to the story.Each frame of its beautifully rendered animation is a work of spellbinding craftsmanship. Characters are brilliantly sketched too & do manage to express emotions amazingly well. Cinematography makes expert use of colour palettes & vibrant use of camera. Editing provides a frenetic pace to the whole narrative & is at its best during the musical numbers, while CGI is seamlessly integrated into its hand-drawn imagery.Although nearly every character in the picture has a well-defined arc, what makes them so much fun is the pitch-perfect voice cast that infuses new life into these characters & provide them their very own souls. James Earl Jones brings a king-like imposing quality to Mufasa, Matthew Broderick does well as Simba, Jeremy Irons is thrilling as Scar while both Nathan Lane & Ernie Sabella steal the show as Timon & Pumbaa with their impeccable timing & perfect chemistry.And last but not the least, I'd like to talk about its magnificent score. Composed by Hans Zimmer who was just starting out back then, the exquisitely arranged & masterfully orchestrated score elevates what was already an incredibly fascinating tale to such a grandeur level of epicness that even today, it remains the finest use of music in any animation feature out there. And further strengthening this aspect are catchy songs written by Tim Rice & Elton John.On an overall scale, The Lion King is an extraordinary blend of a highly gripping story, deftly written screenplay, state-of-the-art animation, cleverly drawn characters voiced by wisely chosen cast, terrific use of humour, skillful camera-work, tight editing as well as an outstanding score plus sensational songs, all of which work in seamless harmony in order to set an entirely new benchmark for its medium & effortlessly succeed.An emotionally stirring adventure that's full of heart, passion & creativity from start to finish, The Lion King is an unabashedly hilarious, occasionally melancholic, extremely intimate, thoroughly enjoyable, delightfully engaging, intensely thrilling, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying fable about life, death, identity, responsibility & resurrection that borrows from William Shakespeare's Hamlet yet is able to carve out its very own identity before it is finished.Marking the last great high for Disney's Renaissance Era that came crashing down soon after the advent of Pixar Animation Studios, The Lion King is a work of cinematic perfection that still stands tall & remains unblemished by the test of time and, for the epic this timeless classic is in every sense of the word, will continue to do so comfortably for a very foreseeable future. Absolutely worth your time & money, the crown jewel of Walt Disney Animation comes one hundred percent recommended.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Its all right...,"This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I might as way say it - I enjoyed the remake of The Lion King (which I'll call LK2) more than the original (hereby called OG). Its possibly attributed to the fact that I saw the LK2 first, but even while watching the animated version, I felt it was really... choppy.Without the nostalgia goggles, as an objective viewing, its not that different from the remake. In fact, LK2 is more drawn out, with the story really taking its time to explore themes and characters. Compare this with the OG, which just bounces from scene-to-scene-to-scene without holding on long enough for anything to marinate. I suppose you could say that about most animated films, but once you have a live-action that actually explores more, its hard to go back.Here are a few things I did enjoy in LK2, which were missing in the OG:
The humor is better written, especially for Timon and Pumba. Most other lead characters have the same dialogue anyhow, so why bother comparing. The hyena antagonists are given more stronger plot threads as opposed to the OG,where they were just maniacally laughing. LK2 is also really beautifully shot; the photo-realism is a huge push in its favor.I will say, however, that the original music is way better. Songs like ""I just can't wait to be king"" and ""Be Prepared"" are bright and colorful,with such a unique charm, I found myself just pulled into the world. If the remake didn't reuse the original soundtrack, and focused on a more updated version, I feel it would have been a better film.I'll probably never see either of these films until I have kids, but I'm a little more inclined to choose the live-action story. Though the OG would have been amazing in its time, its definitely a kids movie going forward, as opposed to a more general-audience film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

The Beginning of the End,"I am simply amazed at how much positive response this emotional hodgepodge has received since its release back in the summer of 1994. As a young teenager back then, I saw it opening weekend on the big screen and remember thinking that it was a very visually engrossing film. In terms of capturing realistic movements and sweeping scenery, the animation in THE LION KING had easily surpassed any of its animated predecessors, and for that I found the movie fantastic. As an adult now, I realize just how superficial my initial attitude toward the film was. If there's one thing that today's overabundance of CGI has taught me, it's that there's more to a film than just ""looking good"". You need story, compelling characters, an original and well-defined conflict, and, especially in the case of animation, an artistic hand with which to draw. There's no denying that many talented artists were at work on THE LION KING, unfortunately too much effort was put forth in animation achievements and too little in developing a solid story and a clever script. Like many other IMDb users, there's no denying that this film was adapted from Shakespeare's HAMLET, just as Disney's 1988 film OLIVER AND COMPANY was adapted from Dickens' OLIVER TWIST. I wonder why Disney did not acknowledge its blatant robbery of subject matter. This is unfortunately just a minor detail in my dislike for THE LION KING. This was, in my opinion, the first in a series of many films that signaled the deterioration of Disney's traditional hand drawn animation department. No doubt about it, they were in a definite slump in the 1980's: THE FOX AND THE HOUND, THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE, THE BLACK CAULDRON (ugh!), but with a fresh new crew in their animation department and a galvanizing reinvention of the formula for animated musicals in THE LITTLE MERMAID, it seemed that Disney had gotten back on its feet. Alas, THE LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and ALADDIN were merely Disney's Indian summer, for with THE LION KING came a completely new generation of animated films. With THE LION KING and its followers, viewers were bombarded with a predictable stories, numerous pop culture references, an obnoxious slew of celebrity voices, dated 90's pop songs, campy humor, and heaping spoonfuls of sugary melodrama. Don't get me wrong, many of Disney's previous efforts had many of the same deficits and only a handful of them would I consider near-perfect, but the animated flicks of old never attempted to sell out their audiences in the way that THE LION KING did. Yet somehow all of these flaws are what made THE LION KING the most successful animated film in Disney history. Call me old school, but I do not think that Walt would have approved of this. Since THE LION KING's release and the replacement of traditional animation with CGI, animation I feel has lost its art. I dare you to re-watch LADY AND THE TRAMP, BAMBI, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, or anything made pre-1960 and compare it to such 90's fares as THE LION KING. You will notice that the films today no longer resemble moving paintings as they once did and as was the original intention of animation. Still, my opinion of THE LION KING, as well as the rubbish that followed (POCAHONTAS THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, HERCULES...okay, MULAN was not bad up until its pop-music ending..THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE???!!!) seems to be the minority. None of these later Disney flicks were works of art, they were just another form of advertisement---predictable story with the feel-good moral of an ending, comic relief sidekicks, a pop song rolling during the end credits, etc. Yes, they all have very admirable morals (what makes a true hero???...it is important to embrace diversity...who's the real monster here???)but (gasp!!!) that's unnecessary political propaganda. Disney wasn't always that wholesome (Does anyone remember the Siamese Cat song from LADY AND THE TRAMP or ""What made the Red Man Red"" from PETER PAN?) and, even when they did take America's sensitivity into consideration, it never overwhelmed the entire project. Oh well, censorship is a completely different subject that needs not be addressed in this review. The point that I'm trying to make is that somewhere along the road animation was no longer considered art but simply cheap entertainment guaranteed to make money. And when I hear praise for films like THE LION KING for merely manipulating the general population with special effects, melodramatic plot twists, pop songs, and cheesy one-liners (not to mention lame attempts at comedy via ninja-fighting), I think back to when an animated film was not just a movie, but an idea, a seed, a creative project, an event, and and art form, and I am saddened.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Best Animated film I have ever seen,"What can I say about this piece of art that hasn't been said yet...? Maybe, why Disney has sold the soul of the animation art to CGI.This film will remain in history as one of the biggest successes of animation, why? You just have to watch the movie and you'll agree.As many late 80' and 90' Disney films the Lion King is composed as a theatrical musical. It's full of great music, that fits perfectly with both relaxed and heart-breaking moments in the film; Hanz Zammer, Tim Rice and Elton John did a very good work here.Voice cast is just wonderful, specially Scar, voiced by Jeremy Irons, is just one of the finest performing I have ever heard.Animation, flawless, beautiful, one of the best of history. A true example of traditional animation.Story is thought to be suitable for both child and adults. There are tons of cultural references; including associations, movie references, famous quotes, and very complex characters. I have done myself a very large analysis on the Lion King and I was surprised about how many things you can extract from a ""Kids movie"". Also there are many funny moments kids will enjoy and two memorable gags.As contras, I've nearly nothing about the film itself. Maybe the Kimba controversy... Disney should have admitted the influence; and the complete absence of important female roles that Disney is so used to. I've also note that the way ""bad"" characters are colored, some signs, are somewhat offensive as they are very stereotypical.My advice, this movie is a MUST for anyone.

"Falls short of the hype; poorly-paced, lacking in proper emotional investment and, sometimes, quite dull.","Often heralded as one of the greatest animated movies of all time - if not the greatest, 'The Lion King (1994)' is a feast for the eyes on multiple occasions but is, for me at least, far from the best in its genre and is actually a rather average affair due to an 'epic'-seeming (though Shakespeare-'stolen') but poorly-paced plot and a lack of emotional investment, aside from in the film's most famous of moments, which tap into a mostly universal connection - and fear - and don't rely on any actual developed characters. The songs, too, are often out-of-place and serve to tell instead of show, or do a combination of the two, and they tend to point out the flaws in the narrative more than gloss over them, though most are enjoyable to listen to in-the-moment and all are well-produced. It really is the lack of a real connection, however, perpetuated by a poor through-line and pace, that makes this one fall short of the pedestal upon which it has been placed. It didn't connect with me and I found a large portion of the piece quite dull, making for a passive affair that didn't live up to the hype or even keep me wholly engaged for its duration. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Lion cub finds identity and returns to be King,","I love this movie and it is by far one of my favorites.The movie ""The Lion King"" is an animated movie that came out in 1994. It was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff. The screenplay writers are Irene Mecchi and Jonathan Roberts. The movie is about a lion cub that looks up to his father Mufasa ""The King"" for everything. He wants to be just like his dad, and be just as brave as his dad. One day, Mufasa gets a message about a herd of animals being on the move and it is to concern the King. The King sees his son clenched to a branch hanging on for his dear life. Mufasa goes to save his son, and in the process, his brother Scar chose to murder him instead of saving his life. Simba did not see Scar kill his father so Scar simply blamed Simba for his death. He forced Simba to run away and never come back.Simba gets out of the pride lands and goes to search for his own identity and find who he really is. He hates himself because he believes he has killed his father. Simba then meets Timon and Pumbaa. Timon and Pumbaa are a meerkat and a warthog. They welcomed Simba and told Simba about themselves by singing a song ""Hakuna Matata."" One day, Simba was out and ran into a beautiful lady lion. They played and later found out that was Nora, his childhood friend. Nora lectured Simba, and told him how scar was ruling Pride Rock. Simba then returns to confront Scar about what truly happened. He fought for his land back and was finally announced King of pride rock.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

A truly beautiful Disney classic.,"The Lion King spoke to me as soon as I saw it. It spoke to me as nothing less than a majestic adventure. Beautifully done on every level; from the music by Elton John or the whole story. I normally do not care for musical numbers, but these were excellent enough to draw me in. James Earl Jones does excellent voice work as Simba's proud and powerful father. It is more dramatically staged than any previous animated film and still remains a powerful work of art to this very day. Even amongst films in general, this one still holds its own as a classic and I think it will remain very powerful for a long stretch of time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Great Family Movie,"This is a great family movie that takes viewers through and makes us think about the circle of life. It makes us think about how our choices affect those around us. It might bring up the idea of death a little early for real young children. Mufasa's death while tragic shows a father's love and what he will do to protect his child all the while showing how greed and the need for power (Skar) can destroy families (in this case the pride). Yes, it is cartoon form, and this takes the edge off the subject since they are fictional characters. Yet the subject is there opening up discussion about our choices and how selfish choices do gain us short term gain from time to time the choices to help others will benefit us for a lifetime.

Tremendously Moving Film.,"The Lion King is one of the best animated films that I have seen along with Aladdin. It is highly moving and one of the most emotional films that I have ever seen.Simba is a young lion who is the heir apparent as King of the pridelands to his father Mufasa. However his evil Uncle Scar wants to be king. When tragedy hits Simba, he leaves the pridelands despite the fact that it is his destiny to be the next king.As far as animation goes, this is legendary. All of the animals look like they do in real life. The scenery is amazing.The songs are good also, not nearly to the level of Aladdins songs, but pretty good. However the non singing music in the background is outstanding.As far as villains go, I think Scar has to be one of the most evil. He is an evil lion who alligns with HYENAS!!!! In case you are not well informed as far as animals go, Hyenas and Lions are bitter enemies who hate each other. The idea of a lion turning his back on lion kind and alligning with hyenas is unthinkable. One of the most evil villains who does help make a great conflict.All of the characters are great. Especially Mufasa, voiced by legendary James Earl Jones. The lessons that he tries to teach his son are phenomenal and ones that envoke a lot of emotion. This film has a lot of moments that are tremondously moving and make me want to cry at parts. Also it has the saddest moment in movie history in my opinion, I wont give it away though.As far as voice acting goes, this film has the best cast to my knowledge. Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Johnathon Taylor Thomas, and many other great voices.Easily one of the best films that I have ever seen. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Fantastic, definitely one of Disney's best!","This movie is extremely special to me and close to my heart, and every time I watch it I still get that lump in my throat when Mufasa dies. The Lion King is impossible not to like, with it's stunning animation, the well fitting voice cast, amazing music that will never be forgotten, and universal rating.Simba is a young lion cub, who lives on Pride Rock, and his father is the King, Mufasa, who is respected and loved by all. This makes Simba a prince and next in line to the throne. Simba is innocent and naive and eagerly wants to grow up and take his place as King. Scar, Mufasa's evil and extremely jealous brother, wants to take over Pride Rock and be King himself, and he is ready to go to any means to get what he wants...Simba, along with his best friend Nala, is having a happy childhood - until one fateful day, where his father is cruelly killed by Scar, right in front of Simba's own eyes, hurting him for life. When Scar tricks Simba into believing that he killed his own beloved dad, Simba runs away, far away, never to return. He meets Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, respectively, who teach him some important lessons: Life is worth living. And Hakuna Matata - no worries. Simba grows from a small cub with a painful past, into a handsome and mature young lion. When Simba and Nala meet again after all these years, Simba's life takes a dramatic turn. But will Simba take his rightful place as King of Pride Rock?Jonathan Taylor Thomas, the voice of young Simba, was very well casted. His voice matches with that of the feisty young cub perfectly. Matthew Broderick, who takes over the part of Simba as an adult, is just as good as his younger counterpart, if not better. I loved the voice of Mufasa, James Earl Jones, his voice is so calming and deep, and sounds wise, perfect for Mufasa, the ageing but immensely respected leader. Jeremy Irons as Scar is so perfectly done, ditto with Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. Timon and Pumbaa's voice overs were done with great finesse and very tastefully, and the voices and characters are very lovable. I thought Nala's older voice, Moira Kelly was miscast. The young girl who played her younger part was much better though.Heartwrenching and loved by many, The Lion King is one that cannot be missed.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Lovely lovely movie,"Writing about this film brings with it a feeling of nostalgia for times gone by. This was in fact the very FIRST movie that I watched on the big screen; way back in 1994. I can still recall the awe and the wonder I had when I sat in the rows (somewhere in the middle I think) and looked up at screen. Ah, the good old days...Anyway, to cut to the chase, the movie itself is a triumph and one of the best animated movies that I've seen. While the story itself is essentially about the eventual triumph of good over evil, this hackneyed theme does not stop the story from being poignant or touching. In fact, one might say that that it actually serves as the moral for a story that after all was aimed at children. The central character of the movie is Simba, the baby cub of Mufasa, the king of the lion pride. The movie begins with his birth and unfolds as we watch Simba mature from a young cub to a youthful lion (the transition occurring in the wilderness after his evil uncle Scar kills off his father). The movie concludes with Simba regaining his rightful place in the ""circle of life"" and becoming a father himself (after an epic fight with Scar. The battle was one of the best scenes of the movie. Extremely Powerful.) And as far as the animation goes, everything is top notch. The songs of the movie were hit songs with ""Hakuna Matata"" becoming a sort of an anthem for a while, I think. All in all, a great movie that should be watched, if only for its songs and some scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

One of the best animated films of all time,"The Lion King was pretty much my favourite movie growing up. It was one of those movies I probably watched dozens of times between the age of 2 and 6, so much so I probably had the entire film committed to memory at some point. So I definitely had fond memories of it, and still felt a great deal of emotional attachment towards the film, but for a while I started thinking- is the movie actually any good? Or was it just overwhelming nostalgia telling me that the movie was better than it really is in cold, cynical, objective reality?I went and watched the film when it was re-released in cinemas back in 2011- in 3D, of course, which was resoundingly ""meh,"" but the whole gimmicky 3D stuff didn't even matter. I was getting to see one of my most fondly remembered childhood films on the big screen, and it was kinda exciting. Of course, the excitement could have led me to be massively let down when viewing the film as an older and (slightly) more mature individual, but thankfully, to my relief, the movie was awesome. I enjoyed it just as much at 17 as I had enjoyed it at 4, and came to realise that the movie was indeed a great one. Nostalgia may have helped a bit, but I still think from a more objective standpoint this is a damn great film- almost certainly my favourite animated movie of all time.Of course it's hard to pick a favourite animation film in a universe where Pixar exists. My pick for my favourite animation film could easily go to almost any of Pixar's masterpieces, but I guess I just feel a bit more connected to The Lion King. There's definitely something very special about it, but it's all a bit tough to put into words.I guess all I can really say is that it's a movie that's just fundamentally effective. Does that make sense? I don't know. There's just so many good components of this movie, and they all come together so well to deliver an extremely satisfying experience.For starters, the story is a fantastic one, dealing with themes of fate, death, pride, betrayal, and other things you don't usually see in a kid's film. The film can get pretty dark at times, but thankfully never to an overwhelming extent, because this does have to be child accessible after all. And I'm also thankful for the fact this movie's not all doom and gloom because it allows for some great humour. I still think Timon and Pumba are a hilarious duo- if you told me you thought they were annoying as hell, I wouldn't argue, but for some reason they never got on my nerves and I found them hysterical. Oh, and Rowan Atkinson as the frequently abused bird servant Zazu is fantastic.That's another thing worth mentioning- the voice acting. It's great across the board, and serious props has to go to whoever helped cast this movie, as there were some incredibly great choices here. Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones... even Matthew Broderick is perfectly suited to his character.The animation and the overall look of the film is brilliant too. There's so much colour in this movie, and it really didn't need a gimmicky 3D conversion for one to become completely immersed in the film's world.And yeah, the music needs a mention too. I know everybody loves all the really memorable songs from the movie, and I imagine I'm not the only person who will never forget the particularly catchy ones (I'm looking at you 'I just can't wait to be king'), but I think more credit needs to go to Hans Zimmer's brilliant score. Zimmer is maybe one of the most praised composers still working today, and while I often find his music works very well with the movies he writes it for, the pieces of music themselves are usually kind of underwhelming to listen to by themselves. However, his score for The Lion King I think is absolutely brilliant, and I also believe his instrumental stuff is just as good as the undeniably catchy and more well-known Elton John songs.So, just watch this movie. You don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. Who says animated films are only for kids anyways?",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
A masterpiece,"Arguably Disney's best film of all time, the Lion King is beautifully set in the African Serengeti.

It explores the themes of self-identity, grief and honour in a beautiful and emotionally-destructive way. The characters all do what they're supposed to do without being too annoying or bland. Scar is an intimidating and terrifying villain who really packs a punch. The songs are all outstanding, my personal favorites being ""Hakuna Matata"" and ""Be Prepared"". It has some the most gorgeous score I've ever heard in a movie which makes the emotional scenes even more sad to watch, to the point where I'm just bawling my eyes out in a little ball on the floor.

"""The Lion King""- An epic animated movie","The Disney's ""The Lion King"" is an animated musical film directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff and produced by Dan Hahn in 1994. This movie was basically an inspiration from William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The Lion King, in my opinion, is an epic movie with a full package of adventures in life. It is a movie filled with happiness, love, family, emotions, lessons etc. The movie is generally based on the subject or theme 'Authority'. In the beginning introduction song, we can see that the entire forest bows down to one true dedicated King, Mufasa the Lion, as we all know, Lion is the King of the Jungle. The movie tells us the story of a King, Mufasa and his son, Simba who is the next king to be. After an unfortunate incident happened to Mufasa, Scar his brother guilty Simba into thinking that he was the reason for the incident. This makes Simba leave his kingdom and run away from his family. The journey of Simba succeeding his father's pride land is the movie, 'The Lion King'. 'The Lion King' is known as the Disney's best ever animation film and I couldn't agree more. To begin with, the voices done for every character suits their personality. The king, Mufasa's voice describe him as a king- strong and ruling, his brother and/or the evil uncle's voice has the grudge, just as his character in the movie. Zazu the bird's character is more toward the funny side so does his voice. The softness and humor in Rafiki's voice represented his character as a caring, fun-filled well-wisher. The roles that each character of the movie represents have done a great job in acting. Since it is a musical film, the voices have higher expectations and I believe that this movie has met with all the expectations. When it comes to animation, it is important to make everything seem so perfect, otherwise, it is easy to point out the mistakes. In that case, this movie has done its best job. I believe that no matter how great the story is, it wouldn't attract or reach the audience if the cinematography is a failure. We all have witnessed the grand success of the film. I would like to talk about the two techniques that I admired about the movie: camera angle, camera movement of the film. Camera angles were extraordinary in this movie. Starting from introduction scene, where Rafiki lifts Simba to show the world that the future king has been born, the angle was so perfect that along with the song, it definitely gives a goosebumps moment. The camera movement throughout the movie was an eye treat to the audience. Especially during the songs, the flow in the movement will definitely make everyone want to dance. Overall, 'The Lion King' has met with all the requirements for a fun-filled entertainment package.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Disney's best,"The Lion King has everything: Hans Zimmer's music, the delicious animation and the wonderful drawings, the superb acting with Mufasa on top and of course the great story this movie tells: it's about life and its stages, the hardness of loss and the difficulty in changing, it's about not running away from your problems, about believing in yourself, about evil, friendship, justice and love...In the 90s Disney movies got an unusual balance: the stories weren't yet the postmodern crap we have today and they had overcome the rancidity from before. The technology was still paper and pencil and the brand new technologies were just used to create epic scenes from scratch. It's not strange that from The little Mermaid (1989) to Tarzan (1999) it was Disney's second youth and just at the half of the decade they peaked with The Lion King (1994).If in 2017 we see Bambi (1942) as a timeless classic I'm sure that in 2070 people will see The Lion King the same way.

The Lion King will work your tear glands- irrespective of your age,"One of the most beloved animated films The Lion King is a great take on Shakespeare's Hamlet.

The animation is gorgeous, the voice actors are very good and the soundtrack, albeit criticized as not being as memorable as other Disney films in some corners usually gets it right.

One of the most important animated films ever,"This is one of the most popular and important Disney animated movies of all time. It's dark, emotionally stirring, and hard to watch at times.

The intro is very memorable and it will forever be remembered as one of the best movie intros of all time. I'm not going to spoil anything but a particular characters death is handled so well that it made most people cry bitter tears regardless of their age. It's probably the most saddest scene for any animated film. Like most Disney animated films, it offered adult themes which makes it good and enjoyable for grown ups as well. With some Disney films my nostalgia wears off but with this film, it gets better every time I watch it. Its final act has more action then you'd expect to find in a Disney film. I did rather enjoy the ending scene. Also, it has one of if not the best movie soundtrack of all time too. It perfectly fit the mood and setting of the movie and it's pretty catchy.

It is a film that has horror, drama, adventure, comedy, and EVERY GENRE! The horror part comes from the terrifying deaths.

Obviously the greatest film of 1994 and even possibly the best film of the 90's. It has no reason to be skipped or given a bad rating, this movie does have many sequels but they're pretty bad, this is the one you should be focusing on.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Great film,"The Lion King really benefits from the larger screen. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more, and you can really savor the animation. Disney didn't need any humans, so they could spend all of the time on a great story and lush landscapes. In fact, its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part of the pride of lions.The music boomed and really created the atmosphere. Although I had seen this picture before, I still was tense because of the way the music played out. Most of the time, I would just roll my eyes at the attempt to make me nervous. But Hans Zimmer's music really bowled me over and made my heart do calisthenics. Unlike such new Disney pics like Lilo and Stitch, the songs actually did some good. They took you out of a somewhat dreary mood and put a smile on your face and made your feet want to tap along. There were only a few, but they were very entertaining. And the Circle of Life song at the beginning was beautiful, with its perfect pictures and perfect sound.I really like James Earl Jones (he's pretty diverse), and this time was no exception. He seemed to act like he didn't want to do this role, but he couldn't contain his excitement for wanting to do voice-overs again (he had done some work in The Simpsons before). Matthew Broderick redeemed himself for me (after the atrocious Ferris Bueller's Day Off) by showing a strong voicing as the adult Simba. Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jim Cummings really had good chemistry together, even though they didn't have much screen time. Irons was really good and creepy as Scar (one of those who you can't help but hate), and if that is him really singing, brava!Be warned, The Lion King isn't really for youngsters. It had intense thematic elements that should have warranted a PG, instead of those that don't deserve it (Lilo and Stitch, again).

This didn't happen the first time; just on the second and third looks. The film just got worse the more I watched it.Maybe I got more culturally aware. I saw how much New Age baloney was thrown into this film, with Elton John singing about the ""circle of life,"" and a bunch of other more subtle Left wing propaganda that is typical of the Disney company.The villain, and even the little hero, became more annoying in multiple viewings. Once again, the more I watched this, the more unappealing both the characters and the story became, not just the ""theology.""Nothing in the story is boring, however. The characters are interesting, from the lions to the hyenas to the warthog and his buddy (who provide most of the comedy in here.) The graphics are top-notch with some of the animation - especially in the beginning - just gorgeous.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

"""Slimy, yet satisfying.""","Okay that's a bit of an unfair quote, as The Lion King is that rarest of beasts: a really good Disney movie. Packed with all the formula highs of past successes (including, Bambi-style, the bizarre kiddie favourite of a murdered parent. What does that say about infant psychology?), yet its sentiment tempered with an Eastern outlook, this is a worthwhile picture.Cute, but never so that it's twee and self-conscious like most of the studio's output, the animation is more sophisticated than the now-creaky ""classics"", yet it steers clear of the more angular, abstract pieces of late. This is a traditional cartoon, and all the better for it. If there's a complaint then it's perhaps the too-brief running time, stretching to little over eighty minutes. This is particularly evident when Simba grows from cub to lion within ten seconds, though the film does contain the requisite three acts.Some great vocal characterisation (Whoopi Goldberg's hyena even strangely looks like her), but I'm not sure about Scar though. So named because he's facially disfigured, he's also darker than the other lions, complete with black mane and has an English accent. Three Hollywood villain stereotypes for the price of one. Though as the voice in question belongs to the superb Jeremy Irons this isn't too much of an issue, and he does meld the film with a darker element. In particular the (delightful, mind) SS symbolism of Scar's army during the best song, ""Be Prepared"". The reference would be lost on the child audience, so it's pitched to the adults. I wonder how many holocaust survivors would find this in good taste?There are some decent jokes, many puns on the nature of lions  ""As far as brains go, I got the lion's share""; ""I'm gonna be the mane event""; ""my words are a matter of pride""  and ""What's eating you?"" ""Nuthin', he's at the top of the food chain."" The rite of passage plot is as generic as the majority of the songs, yet both are loveable in context. I don't know if Buddhists would approve of their philosophies being transformed into Mickey Mouse morals and tracks by Elton John, but it still works in a naive way. Odd too how the lions accept the nature of karma and respect for all animals. Whenever I watch a Richard Attenborough show they're always tearing out zebras' hearts with their bare teeth. Still, I suppose they had to keep it a U certificate somehow...Some movie referencing combined with violence towards the end are dubious occurrences. Yet that and a couple of fart gags not withstanding, this is an innocuous affair that epitomises family entertainment. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
My favorite cartoon!,"My favorite cartoon! This is a story about family, love and friendship. As in life, is found in the betrayal, but good always triumphs over evil. And evil will always be punished. It is instructive cartoon. My children will definitely be watching it! Simba is shown here as a loyal and loving son, who so faithfully loves his father. I cried when Simba cried. Incredible sensations. I believe that such cartoons should be more. A lot more. It's not just a cartoon, it's the whole story!

90's Bambi,"Disney returns to style with 'The Lion King', a great story for the whole family about a young lion and his destiny.This young lion's name is Simba, but they might as well call him Sambi, as it's the tale of a young animal who has to face his responsibilities after the death of an elder, in this case, Simba's father King Mufasa.Evil genius is uncle Scar, who wants to rule himself, and he does as Mufasa gets killed and Simba leaves the kingdom, thinking he's responsible for his fathers death.Movie lightens up a bit then with the introduction of the hilarious Timon and Pumbaa, then turns heavy-handed again when Simba reclaims the crown when he returns to the kingdom.Fantastic animations and a compelling story make it an experience world wide, although the songs aren't the best IMHO.Overall: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
It's No Toy Story,"Hard to believe Disney could make a film this bad a year before releasing Toy Story.The characters have no depth. The hero is a loser. Sure, movies like Aladdin portray the hero as conflicted and imperfect but Simba consistently fails and never demonstrates inner good.The songs are forgettable, and start predictably. And oddly whenever there is a song the full color goes away and becomes all yellow and orange or all dark. What is already a cartoon becomes even more cartoony.Most movies of this type have the main character experience a series of adventures, building to a climax. This one is missing that build-up. Not only that but it has the main character facing death - DEATH - time and again. I would not allow a child to see this, even if the parent could endure it.On the plus side the life lesson of the ""circle of life"" with carnivores shown eating actual meat is refreshing as compared with other Disney films trying to convert animals to vegetarianism.Much of the film looks gloomy and dingy - like some of the dystopian films where they de-saturate the colors. I watched it in 3D on a 65"" screen and was disappointed in the view.I paid for my copy of the film. I will be re-selling it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

The greatest animated family movie of all times!!!,"In comparison to every other Disney (which makes -in my opinion- the greatest productions in animated movies) film, is the top of the tops! Every meaning that tries to pass to the viewer is going right to the feelings, no matter the age! I think that it is quite educational for every person who watches that!Despite it analyzes an animal kingdom, you can easily locate a man society in which everyone tries to be on the highest level without calculating the other ones, no matter if they are relatives or friends or anything else. Important values presented in this movie such as friendship, co-operation, love, anti-racism messages and -of course- family! Last but not least, is the music of the film.

My Favorite Film Period!,"I'm just going to come right out and say it, I think this is ""Sensational""! I grew up in the 2nd Golden Disney era, and while the other films were brilliant, The Lion King was the one that always stood out. It's profound coming-of-age story has filled me with joy and heartache. In fact the older I become, the more I can appreciate the art, script, and journey the filmmakers went through.The aspects of this films are excellent as far as I'm concerned. I'll start with the animation. It's stunning! The artists and animators alike went the full nine yards to grab the audience's imagination and put them on Safari ride. It's precision as well as colorful nature has turned the savanna into a combination of a documentary and fantasy.The music is a blast to listen to! Elton John & Tim Rice were right on the money. They combine elements of pop-show-tunes and moving ballads, so it remains catchy, fresh, easy, and moving all at the same time. The score by Hans Zimmer has been nothing short of splendid. It captures the essence within the first five minutes. The power and majesty of the score awakens the senses and even heart. And credit should absolutely be given to Lebo M for providing the culture and spirit of South Africa. Sirli all these very different of equally talented men into one project and you have something magnificent.And finally- what a remarkable cast! If it hadn't been for these fantastic men & women, we wouldn't have the characters with the same amount of depth or hysteria. Each actor borough a critical but top notch performance. And a standing ovation to them should be given. James Earl Jones, Jermy Irons, Matthew Broderict, Johnathan Taylor Thomas, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkins, Moria Kelley, Robert Guillume, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings should all be immensely proud to have been apart of this project.All in all this film couldn't be anymore entertaining to me. Filled with drama,laughter,suspense,adventure,romance and tragedy. It's become one of the most beloved and acclaimed thematic experiences. And it thrills me to know people around the world continue to celebrate it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Best Disney movie by far!,"Looking back on my childhood, The Lion King was definitely one of the best films ever made! Because it's Disney, it automatically has that quintessential cute factor, but The Lion King is also a powerful story. I love the theme in this movie - that while you cannot change the past, you should learn from it and take responsibility. The ending is one of the most powerful scenes. Even more, I love the characters. Who doesn't love Simba's courage (his childhood was definitely not ideal!), Mufasa's glory, Rafiki's quirky wisdom, and of course, Timon and Pumbaa's comic relief?I'll admit I'm slightly biased because The Lion King was also made in my generation, so I feel a certain connection towards it. But this movie really is the perfect combination of profound life lessons, humour, and entertainment. The songs are catchy as with all Disney, and some, like the ""Circle of Life,"" even have some meaningful lyrics. Also, the background music compliments the action in the movie very well. The voice acting is brilliant, with a strong vocal cast nailing their respective roles. Too bad Disney films aren't made this way now...The Lion King was definitely on the money.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Awesome Film,"Awesome Film I love the story and idea concept. It is a family oriented movie with laughs, morals, and values.

Only to be manipulated by his so called uncle that ended up persuading him that he was the reason his dad got killed. But to only realized as he become older that all of it was a lie. He found out that his uncle was the one to have set him up. So in revenge, he goes back as an adult lion to fight for his pride and territory.

Courage,"The cell-shaded 2D animation of the wide range of animals combines easily with the matte painted backgrounds which add visual depth and beautiful scenery in likes of waterholes, mountain ranges, lush forests and waterfalls. The foreground and background blend seamlessly and the world of The Lion King is endlessly alive and breathing even with its limited selection of camera movements. It's at once more inviting than the relatively sterile 3D environments of some more modern Disney works (Big Hero 6 comes to mind). The film's soundtrack is similarly impressive. Elton John and Tim Rice combine to bring five original songs that still draw applause, recognition and sing-a-longs even two decades later. The opening Zulu choral vocals of The Circle of Life are powerful and evocative, while the animated choreography that combines with I Just Can't Wait to Be King makes for a jaunty upbeat tune. Hans Zimmer's score goes from strength to strength, drawing upon traditional African choral themes and percussion which resonates during the film's emotional moments.The voice acting is unique and enduring. The booming bass tones of James Earl Jones makes for a imposing father figure in Mufusa, in contrast to Jeremy Irons' Scar, rich with haughty disdain for his pride-mates. A fun filled exile in the middle of the film is characterised by that of the jovial Timon and Pumbaa, while young Simba's voice grows into the deeper tones of Matthew Broderick, during an excellent and colour filled montage over Hakuna Matata. The three hyena cronies of Scar are also distinct despite their ugly cloned appearances, boasting the voice work of Whoopi Goldberg, Marin and Cummings as the overly enthusiastic, sassy and hot-headed henchmen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

A Disney classic,"In the African savannah King Mufasa, a lion, rules over the Pride Lands. He explains to his son, a young cub named Simba, that one day he will be the king... but before that he has a lot to learn. There are dangers, even for lions. The greatest danger comes from Simba's Uncle Scar; an embittered lion with a Machiavellian streak. Scar wants to rule but to do that he needs to rid himself of Mufasa and Simba... he has plans. One day Scar's plan works; Mufasa is dead and Simba leaves the Pride Lands believing he is to blame for his father's death. He grows up learning to take things easy with new friends Pumbaa and Timon, a warthog and meerkat. Scar now rules the pride with the help of the hyenas. When Simba learns of how bad things have got in the Pride Lands he will have to decide whether to continue the easy life or fight to make things better.This film is definitely one of Disney's classics; it has a fine story, some great characters and catchy songs. Simba is a decent protagonist even if the plot demands that he isn't too strong early on and Scar is a great villain; as are his trio of hyena acolytes. Given the film's 'U' certificate I was surprised at how dark it is in places; some scenes might disturb younger viewers as characters are often in real danger. The voice cast is very impressive; notably Jeremy Irons, as Scar, James Earl Jones, as Mufasa, and Rowan Atkinson, as Zazu the hornbill who is Mufasa's majordomo. As one would expect from Disney the animation and character designs are all really good.

And he will have the help of two of the most beloved Disney characters: Timon and Pumba, an unlikely (a meerkat and a warthog) but inseparable pair of friends.

The Lion King has many wonderful, comprehensible morals which are built up right to the very end. Plenty of action, a well designed plot, great animations, (I personally like the songs). It is a very well thought out film, and although it may appear to be for younger audiences, I would still encourage everyone to see it at least twice.This video is basically a biography of a young lion born to a ""royal"" family (the lion being the ""king of beasts"") Symba lives the life that many of us can relate to, curioius when young, and he grows up to be a great and mighty king due to his experiences along the way. Faced, however, by an ""evil uncle"", he must face many hardships along the way, including separation from his family for a long time.

The king of all animated films.,"The Lion King is an animated Disney film featuring voice of Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, and James Earl Jones. The film revolves around a future king who is tricked by his evil uncle to never return. This film is also inspired by the Shakespeare play Hamlet which both films have the same plot line, except The Lion King is more appropriate for children than Hamlet. And that's what makes this movie so perfect in every way is that the screenwriters decided to take a classic Shakespeare play and make their own version made for kids, while at the same time not following Hamlet down to detail. Before the new Lion King comes out I thought I watched the original where it all began. The animation that went into this film is beautiful as everyone involved really took the time to develop a film that has passion and soul to it. And the voice acting is top notch too from James Earl Jones as Mufasa to Jeremy Irons as Scar. In all of Disney movies there will never be a better voice actor as Jeremy Irons. Ever delivery is chilling and sends goosebumps thinking about it that if there was ever someone to narrate my life he would make that list. I don't know how the new Lion King will turn out, but I know that this Lion King trumps the new one, and all Disney films. And while this may be he king of all animated films, the soundtrack provided was average with one or two songs that are excellent to listen too. So before you watch the new one take a moment to go back where it all began and experience a movie so hypnotic and beautiful from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
The last GREAT hand-drawn animation movie EVER,"this movie is probably the best Disney movie ever. the plot is intriguing, never slowing down, and it keeps you interested throughout the entire thing.they don't waste a second with ""fluff"" in this movie, every minute is important to the plot. scar is probably the most evil Disney bad guy ever, and the story goes beyond the love/exploring the world cliché that other Disney movies are. this movie is unparalleled by anything Disney ever made.this movie probably marked the end of the era of hand-drawn animation. toy story came out the year following the lion king, and it ushered in a whole new wave of computer animation that will brush hand-drawn animation aside. after this movie, hand-drawn animated movies just went downhill in quality in general (okay, mulan wasn't that bad, but still doesn't even compare to the lion king.) think about it. all the good animated movies that are coming out now (finding nemo, shrek 1 and 2) are done by computer. it's a shame that there most likely won't be any attention paid to the art of hand-drawn animated movies anymore.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
From a person who generally does not enjoy a Disney musical this one was pretty good.,"I know my score does not seem all that high, but trust me from me a seven is good for a motion picture of this type. This one, unlike many other Disney musical cartoons is a film I say was pretty good. The songs were okay and fit the story well and the animation was rather good and the story not all that bad either. The humor was funny, and though it got semi serious at times the flow of the film was good and never really bogged down even when it did tend to be a bit more on the sentimental side. The story of a young lion cub, who is the son of the lion that rules the valley is nice. You watch him progress through this life and you meet the villain Scar who hatches a plan to not only rid the valley of this cub, but the father as well who happens to be Scar's brother. He does this with help from the hyenas and after seemingly succeeding with getting rid of those two, he takes over the valley and lets the hyenas do as they wish. Well unbeknown to Scar, the son, Simba, has survived and he becomes friends with a couple of funny characters Timon and Pumbaa. They add a lot of comedy to the film and I really laughed at the scene where they sing their song as a distraction using Pumbaa as basically bait. So a nice movie that ends really quickly and is good even to a guy who usually dislikes this type of movie this one is a nice treat.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Disney's Pride,"""The Lion King"" is a very good movie. It's entertaining and funny. It's moving and overall a very satisfying film. But if I went through this review listing everything that's good about ""The Lion King"" it would be to long. It does have all of the characteristics and a technically fine movie so I will just go over some of the little things that kept me from giving this film a slightly higher rating.The story, while completely technically proficient with all beats hit, felt a little thin to me. The story works fine, but it doesn't really explore the world of ""The Lion King"" and flesh out the atmosphere as I feel it should. It felt like there were missing scenes now and then.The only other complaint is rather minor. I felt the animation was a little poor at times. While this film is mostly quite beautiful and a joy to behold, at some points the animation just felt limited. Mostly it was because of lack of detail in the environments, and small amount of character environment interaction. However like I said this amounts to be a small complaint.Overall this is just a really good film. 7.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Brilliant Musical,"This film is not only an incredible narrative but a wonderfully brilliant and imaginative score that puts this musical at number one permanently.Each character has been thoroughly fleshed out and that is very satisfying for an animated film.

The film captures the African culture and the importance of the pride lands in this beautiful representation of wild life and the circle of life. From its rich visuals, and incredible music from Elton John and Hanz Zimmer there will never be a musical that nearly reaches this epic animated film.It will be hard to ever reach the success and popularity of The Lion King.

The pinnacle.,"This is peak Disney, their magnum opus. All other Disney films since are measured by how they compare to this one, and so far nothing Disney's done has come particularly close. The only other animated films of the last 30 years that deserve a seat at the table with this behemoth are Studio Ghibli's 'Spirited Away' and Pixar's 'Toy Story', with The Lion King still being the best of the three.What puts this film above all others is its engagement factor-there isn't an age group that won't be just as entertained and intrigued by this film as another. It's heart-wrenching, hilarious, romantic, exciting, dramatic and at times even a bit scary. It never hits a lull, and-so far-never gets old. This film is, by every measure, a masterpiece.

Strong and engaging animation film that has its issues and its messages but delivers on an entertaining level above all else.,"I suppose it's fun to re-visit a Disney film every now and again; The Lion King holding a rather special place in my psyche as well as my heart for it was the first film I ever saw at a cinema. Needless to say; watching it now for perhaps the first time proper since that cinema viewing hasn't made me like it or love it any more than I perhaps did then but it hasn't made me dislike it any more, either.The Lion King was made at a time when Disney was booming. The 1980s wasn't exactly a great decade for Disney but what with The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and the best picture Oscar nominated Beauty and the Beast; Disney were thriving. So there was an expectancy behind The Lion King and watching it now, it does deliver on an entertaining and well told and well animated level. I laughed at some of the jokes, couldn't remember certain scenes and generally enjoyed it. But the film does feel like it is orientated at children more than adults. The general synopsis for the film does not rely on a love story like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast did but rather uses a theme of self discovery with a rather meek love plot entwined between Simba and Nala; the two lead lions of the narrative. This would suggest more of an infant target audience as the film would like to think it is educating young ones on how to face your fears and beat your demons etc.But this isn't a criticism, merely an observation. Aladdin was as routine love story as you could ever get but it included the genie as a post-modern stroke of genius that made the adults laugh. Similarly; the complicated love story in Beauty and the Beast, full of emotions and situations kids won't have experienced yet had the items of furniture that amused and entertained on another level. In The Lion King, there is no get out clause; there is no escape hatch that the film can rely on to get across to two demographics. I suppose if Simba's journey of enlightenment is supposed to be aimed at adults then the buddy combination of Timon and Pumbaa are supposed to be kid orientated but I didn't see it entirely this way  yes Timon and Pumbaa seem adult enough but they remain too lacking in everything else what with the emphasis of toilet humour cropping up every now and again.Like most Disney films, The Lion King suffers from its issues with race, religion, class and/or gender. People will deny it but that's only because they cannot see it. The lions in The Lion King are golden brown, beautiful and voiced by Americans; all apart from Scar who is brown with a black mane. It's no surprise that he is the 'evil' one and is consequently English, voiced by Jeremy Irons. There is also the shameful representation through the hyenas: one is Mexican, one is a mute retard and the other may well be voiced by an American (Goldberg) but in truth; the character is a big, black, loud, 'man-eater' of an animal. Watch Aladdin when the title character steals a loaf of bread and the representation of the fat black woman who hugs him whilst saying the line: ""Still I think he's ravishing!"" There is also the character of Timon who is the victim of Disney's most cruel representation. Timon's gender is confused; it is neither male nor female and his name is too ambiguous to be classed as one or the other. Timon is extremely effeminate and embodies very 'touchy-feely' traits around Pumbaa; frequently stroking his rear-end and stroking his nose and general facial area. Timon's voice actor Nathan Lane is also homosexual and I read that the line towards the end where the distraction tactic of 'dressing in drag and doing the hula' was improvised, further embodying homosexual traits on this character. Now; whilst my specific class/race/sexuality/etc. wasn't targeted to extremities (Scar was English, like I am but I'll look past that); I still feel these sorts of things are highly unnecessary in a film I've already established is child orientated.The characters are also obsessed with food. There is frequent reference to food and hunger. The lionesses report no food which angers Scar, Pumbaa belches before announcing that he is 'starved' and the Hyenas live in a constant state of looking where the next meal will come from. There is also heavy emphasis on how Timon and Pumbaa get by on nourishment by eating bugs. Perhaps this is reference to Africa's state of affairs regarding health and food with the Ethiopian humanitarian crisis of the 1980s fresh in memory. The Lion King also suffers in its obvious plotting: the hero has a wrong belief but needs a mentor to come out of the blue to aid him in his correct quest which I found a little forced and unoriginal for a film made in 1994. But the message about the 'circle of life' and the ideas that you confront your demons when required is good with Mufasa himself saying ""I'm only brave when I need to be; I don't go looking for trouble."" The film clearly saying that picking fights is not a good idea.The Lion King also has time to throw in a domestic relationship featuring Simba and Nala. They meet up; reminisce; Simba shows her around and to 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight', they make love before breaking up the morning afterwards. Incidentally, the sex is witnessed by Timon who displays disappointment and disgust. The Lion King is a somewhat strange film but has fun with its plot and its characters and is an enjoyable animation film on the whole with one or two tragic scenes particularly standing out in memory for me; both then in the cinema and now.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

MPAA Rating: ""G""In the tradition of some of the greatest Disney animated features of all time,Disney's ""The Lion King"" remains supreme as one of the greatest Disney produced masterpieces of all time,even if it is within a class by itself.

As close to animated perfection as you can get,"Disney's The Lion King capped a highly lucrative 5 years for the House of Mouse, who were, before The Little Mermaid came along in 1989 and turned their fortunes around, in real danger. It seems ridiculous to think that the studio that now routinely make billions of dollars a year with their Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm output, as well as their recent fondness for re-imagining their so-called 'Disney Animated Classics' series in live-action, could have ever been in danger of actually going under. Yet Mermaid made the millions, Beauty and the Beast (1991) won critical adoration, and Aladdin (1992) charmed, and the rest is history.I remember seeing The Lion King in cinemas back in 1994 with my mum, and not being particularly over-awed. I didn't shed a tear when Mufasa was betrayed, nor was I singing the songs to myself in the car ride home. However, it felt like I was the only one, as the film's popularity seemed to increase each year, with home release re- masters, soundtracks and a theatre production jamming every one of my senses, even now, 22 years later. It was because of this, and partially because I'm an old-school (1930's-60's) Disney loyalist, that I shunned The Lion King for all these years. After finally viewing it again, I wish I had a time machine to slap the 10 year old version of myself, as this is about as close to animated perfection as you can get.For anyone who has somehow never seen the film, The Lion King tells the story of King Mufasa (James Earl Jones), a respected and formidable beast who rules over the Pride Lands of Africa. The arrival of his new son and heir, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Matthew Broderick), is cause for celebration across the plains, except, that is, for Mufasa's weak and envious brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) and his hyena friends (Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings). When Scar's plan to usurp Mustafa's throne ends in tragedy, Simba flees with guilt and shame, finding unlikely friends in the slow-witted warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) and motor-mouthed meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane). As Scar's rule leaves Simba's former homeland a hyena-ridden wasteland, will the would-be king fulfil his destiny and take back his crown?From the enchanting, wordless opening scene in which Simba is shown off to the crowd to the tune of Circle of Life, to the savage, expressionistic climax which sees hero and villain have their final showdown, I felt completely immersed in this world, regardless of the fact that I knew the story back to front. This is Disney at its most thoughtful, magical and hilarious. Perhaps taking a page from Studio Ghibli's environmentally-aware book, the film shows a real respect for the natural world despite anthropomophising its characters and dabbling in pseudo-mysticism. Lane and Sabella shine as Timon and Pumbaa, two of Disney's most beloved comedic side- kicks, who also get to belt out one of their most beloved tunes in Hakuna Matata. I'll most likely never be convinced that Disney will manage to recreate the beauty and warmth of the likes of Dumbo (1940) and Bambi (1942) during their Golden Age, but The Lion King is the closest it's ever come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

No worries this is a classic,"Hakuna Matata, the catchphrase that this movie made many say for years, the movie is full of action and fun, that has made it one of the best 2D animation one could see, the movie dialogue is also intriguing and funny, the movie which seems to be in three parts, the first being Simba's life in Pride rock, his life with Timon and Pumbaa where he loses some of his Lion instincts and the last part where he goes back to Pride rock to reclaim his throne.The Lion King was the first Disney animated feature to be a total original story, all other animations before it have been based on an already existing work. The idea of the movie was conceived during the promotion of Oliver & Company, the idea was basic: a story about animals that will be set in Africa. The filmmakers, then went ahead to build the story taking ideas from the lives of Joseph and Moses (from the Bible) and William Shakespeare's Hamlet.The movie production began during the time of the production of Pocahontas, many of the animators and directors at Disney felt that not many people will want to sit and watch a little Lion cub who is framed for murder (murder of his father) by his uncle, for that reason alone many of the animators wanted to work on Pocahontas instead, but to their surprise although both were financially successful, Lion King made more money (it has become the highest grossing 2D animation ever) and received more positive reviews.The voice casting for Lion King, was full of stars from Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg (just to mention a few) and even Disney's long time voice artist Jim Cummings was also available in this unending list of star voice actors.The movie plot of Lion king is about a lion cub named Simba who gets framed for murdering his father (Mufasa voiced by James Earl Jones) by his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons). Simba runs away from his right as heir to the throne and meets and befriends a meerkat, Timon (Nathan Lane) and a warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella). Things were going well but the past that Simba ran from found him where he was hiding and now Simba (Matthew Broderick) has to go back to Pride Rock to face his past.Lion King is a nice animation to own and watch again. Two home video sequels were done of the movie, The Lion King 2 (not worth watching at all) and The Lion King 11/2 (good enough to be seen), and a series about Timon and Pumbaa was also done, which was amusing.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Classic stuff,"There's a reason this is considered a classic. And while that term has been used or rather missused over at least the last couple of years or decade(s), this is one of those times it really fits. The movie is an animated fairy tale, that is also a bit grim at times. Still this is the circle of life ... and has so many memorable songs. Listening to the audio commentary, you come to realize how many things were in the balance while making this. How many things that are being considered genius now, were last minute decisions or things that they were doubting themselves (or the studio did).So it is a fine line, between making somethinng reat and failing at making something at all. Fortunately for us (and Disney of course) they really hit the ball out of the park (which is a baseball metaphor as I understand and is something good). This being so short (considereing the additional 30 minutes I think of the remake), make it a fast and enjoyable ride.Apart from the fine animation (the remale looks photorealistic and can almost not be considered animation, both look awesome), you have fantastic voice actors. This is true for both films, but it was way more difficult in the 90s to convince actors to lend their voice to an animated movie. Known ""regular"" actors that is, because apparently it was all an imaging/marketing thing for them too. Which is understandable - but anyone who didn't get on board with this, might have many regrets now. Good thing they were able to convince the cast they ended up using. The voices add to the overall feeling.There is something for the whole family here - and hopefully you can see that too - no pun intended",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

A real Disney beauty,"The opening scene of The Lion King will show where you stand with this film in terms of what generation you were born in. People born outside of this generation (say, anytime before 1980) will find it pleasing and enjoyable. Those from this current generation (1981 and beyond, myself included) will be simply in awe and, if one were to recall this from their childhood (who from this time period hasn't seen this?) they may even shed a few tears.I did and I'm not afraid to admit it. The Lion King is a dashingly fierce achievement from Disney, one with gripping scenes of delight and uncompromising beauty and charm. Its songs seem more than just standard Disney archetypes, but those of true power and importance, especially ""Hakuna Matata"" and ""Circle of Life,"" the opening ballad.The story concerns Simba, a feisty cub whose parents, Mufasa and Sarabi, carry a very respected reputation throughout the land. Mufasa is ""the king of the jungle"" and Simba ""can't wait to be king,"" and for that reason, is always getting into some sort of trouble. Mufasa's brother, Scar, is jealous and holds an incredible disdain for his brother and Simba. When Simba gets himself into big trouble, causing a wild stampede of hyenas (which, by the way, is just breathtakingly slick and stylish), Mufasa is killed by Scar, when trying to rescue Simba. Scar makes Simba feel as if he was responsible for the death of his father and implores him to run away.So he does, and Scar takes the throne in no time, running the Pride Lands into the ground and completely ruining the consistency and order Mufasa took so long to build.Upon running away, Simba meets up with Timon, a meerkat, and Pumba, a warthog in ""the jungle, the mighty jungle."" They teach the naive little cub how to thrive in the jungle, and fast-forward a few years, and Simba is older, stronger, even feistier than before, and with a full grown mane.The Lion King collectively merges the classic Shakespearean story of Hamlet with the divine simplicity and the ""walk on the other side of the road"" formula of their 1967 hit Jungle Book into a true achievement in every category. There's a beautiful thing about the way the film conceives emotions and builds on locations. From the first frame to the last, it is littered with evocative landscapes, some of which are hard to believe they're only hand-drawn, pre-CGI work. The use of lighting and darkness can be vaguely called ""animation noir"" before it became a real standard, with the sunlit landscapes of the Pride Lands and the excellent use of darkness when it came to showcasing the Scar character, is truly masterful and beyond words.It is also interesting to note that The Lion King sort of kicks off Disney's ""dare to be different"" phase that it maintained well into the 2000's with films like Atlantis: The Lost Empire and Lilo and Stitch truly pushing what the company can really do. The Lion King's story, mainly centered around guilt, power, and redemption, is a lot darker with only occasional touches of humor breaking through the melancholic presence of the story. The youngsters may have a hard time coping. I know if I saw this any younger than six it would've been uncomfortable. Though it seems that with the abundance of re-releases the film is getting, the story appeals to those of all ages.NOTE: It's a shame that Disney has stooped to the level of manipulation and tampering with this grandiose animated achievement. To see it get a 3D re-release and multiple re-releases on DVD just to become lucrative for the company, also equipped with a surcharge, is somewhat heartbreaking.Voiced by: Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, and Rowan Atkinson.

"A Terrific Adventure for all Ages,","The Lion King is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a great voice cast. It's an absolute classic that still holds up today as a beautifully animated and exhilarating film, I become warped in to this universe every time I watch it and almost immediately because of its beautiful opening image, we really care for these characters and support them on the journey they are headed on, it can be quite dark at times, very emotional, but it never forgets to add some great comic relief. I felt like the film could have taken more time to develop Scar's character, it needed to make its audience more aware of his motives, not just his plans on achieving them, I would have liked to have seen longer scenes between him and the hyenas, as this is when the villain is truly honest about who he really is, and he is certainly one of the greatest Disney villains there is. The characters and voice acting in this film are certainly the best part and save it from being a boring animation with talking animals, Simba, Timon, Pumba, Mufasa, Nala, Rafiki, Zazu and Scar are all characters that I remember fondly from my childhood, as I watched this film again and again, and still today love them just as much as ever, as I understand some of their lines, particularly from Timon, that I never did when I was younger. Beautifully animated, jam packed with great songs, memorable characters and emotional scenes, the Lion King is easily some of Disney's greatest work, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film.A young lion cub runs away from home after believing he accidentally killed his father, although it was actually his uncle, who intends on becoming the King of Pride Rock.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

This movie has been setting record numbers for box-office sales and merchandising revenue around the world, and inspiring thousands of fans to build on its story with their own creativity.After you and/or your children have seen the Lion King and enjoyed it you might want to watch some more good animation movies also by Walt Disney, so I made a list of quality animation movies for you: ""Jungle Book"", ""Snow white and the seven dwarfs"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Aladdin"", ""Bambi"", ""The beauty and the beast"", ""Pinocchio"", ""The hunchback of the Notre Dame""And some of the very latest animation movies ""Ice Age"", ""The Incredibles"" (made by computer) Finding Nemo (idem) and last but not least ""shrek"" 1 and 2",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Must watch, especially if you love animals","I love it since childhood!
I love the characters and the music. I never liked the tragedy and darkness of the plot though, that's why I put 8.
Songs are great whatever language you translate them to. And the drawings (animation) is a classic Disney.
I loved this cartoon so much that even had stickers with Lion King characters. And now I've got a T-shirt with little Simba.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Undeniably a Masterpiece,"Probably what bugs me about The Lion King is the character design of the lions. Basically, everything I find visually engaging about lions is all but left out of the character design. Beauty & the Beast and Aladdin both had far stronger character designs, as indeed did many previous Disney films centring around animals. It would, however, be foolish of me to fish for any other faults that are simply non-existent.The Lion King is a masterpiece. Good story? Check. A royal lion cub who's a bit on the spoiled side sees his world fall apart when his father dies in a wildebeest stampede. Tricked into thinking he was responsible, he flees and adopts a life of ease with the carefree duo Timon and Pumbaa.This is some epic stuff. Though I decided not to include The Lion King in my favourites list of animated movies, my breath is still taken away when Simbaa sees those wildebeest run down into the canyon. That whole scene is one of the most heartbreaking scenes of cinema I have ever seen. There are real highs and lows here, a quality that most of the old Disney movies sorely lacked (and this coming from a big fan).Another big plus is the music. The soundtrack goes the whole scale. When all is well in Simbaa's life, there is hopeful music echoing of the jungle and the savannah. Then things get darker and the music gets deeper and more epic than anyone who's not heard it can imagine. ""Be Prepared"" is excellent and rightfully scary as the following scene testifies. The stampede score is one of the most ground-shaking pieces of music I have ever heard. When that all gets too much, there's ""Hakuna Matata"", the ultimate anthem for carefree living, to soothe the soul. Personally, Elton John's original version of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (in the end credits) is the stronger of the two presented; I can hardly fight back tears every time I hear it. ""The Circle of Life"" set the tone for how movies should start and not for no reason. The whole audio part of this movie is a complete bullseye.The characters themselves, even if I really dislike most of the designs, are mostly very good. Scar is wickedly ambitious. Rafiki shows that wise characters can also be tremendously funny, and it's not for no reason that Timon and Pumbaa got their own show; they are wonderful. Equally great are the three hyenas. Then of course, there's Sazu (wonderfully voiced by Rowan Atkinson), the unfortunate bird who's the butt of the crown, no matter on which side of the family he's standing.With a stunning climax, soaring music and a roaring (sic), engaging story, The Lion King is a movie that hits every mark it needs right. It hits home with the audience and makes them feel for this world. It may not hit the mark with my aesthetic senses, but to pretend that the movie was lesser because of that would be foolish of me. The Lion King is a masterpiece, on par with the Beauty & the Beast.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Great film,"Really amazing animated film!For anyone that hasn't seen it, the story is basically an adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet set in the African pride-lands, with animals as it's main characters. In short, lion cub Simba is the next heir to the throne, with his dad Mufasa the current king. Mufasa's brother Scar jealously feels that he should have been next in line and that is where we have our villain, and a good one at that. I can't give anything else away, but what follows is a fantastic adventure mixing good-vs-evil, great characters and a very Shakespearean story of revenge and coming- of-age.
Most of it is nitpicking, but as an adult I have grown to appreciate movies for their stories and I must say that the third act (the final conflict) is a little rushed and it threw my adult mind off a little bit, having just witnessed such a fantastic build up. But other than that, I was surprised to find that none of the characters or songs annoy me as they do many other adults that saw it as a kid. Another thing that is always brought to my attention is that the message of the film is a little mixed (which I won't spoil).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

A Timeless Animated Masterpiece with Emotional Depth,"Disney's ""The Lion King"" (1994) is an animated classic that stands the test of time as one of the most beloved and enduring films in the studio's illustrious history. Directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, this epic tale of love, loss, and leadership in the African savannah captures both the imagination and the heart with its compelling story, memorable characters, and stunning visuals.At the center of this cinematic gem is the story of Simba, a young lion prince voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Matthew Broderick. The character's journey from an adventurous cub to a mature and responsible king is both touching and inspiring. Simba's growth is handled with care and depth, resonating with audiences of all ages.James Earl Jones lends his iconic voice to Mufasa, Simba's wise and powerful father, delivering lines with a majesty and warmth that have become synonymous with the character. Jeremy Irons' portrayal of the cunning and malicious Scar is equally impressive, creating a villain who is both feared and fascinating.The supporting cast, including the likes of Nathan Lane as Timon and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa, provides much of the film's humor and heart. Their performances, along with those of Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Jim Cummings as the hyenas, add layers of comedy and personality to the film.""The Lion King"" is a visual marvel, with animation that was groundbreaking at the time and remains impressive to this day. The vibrant colors, fluid motion, and expressive character animations bring the African savannah and its inhabitants to life in a way that is both realistic and stylized.The music by Hans Zimmer, along with songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, is nothing short of iconic. Tracks like ""Circle of Life,"" ""I Just Can't Wait to be King,"" ""Be Prepared,"" ""Hakuna Matata,"" and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" are not only integral to the film's storytelling but have also become part of the cultural lexicon.""The Lion King"" tackles themes of responsibility, redemption, and the circle of life with a maturity that belies its status as a children's film. The narrative is epic in scope yet intimate in its emotional impact, dealing with complex issues like death and betrayal in a way that is accessible and meaningful.If there is any criticism to be levied at ""The Lion King,"" it might be that some of the more mature themes and moments of peril could be intense for very young viewers. However, these elements are handled with care and contribute to the film's depth and emotional resonance.In conclusion, ""The Lion King"" is a triumph of animation, storytelling, and musical composition, a film that transcends the label of 'children's movie' to become a piece of art that appeals to all ages. Its powerful narrative, combined with stunning visuals and unforgettable music, earns it a well-deserved 9 out of 10. It's not just a film but a cultural phenomenon that continues to resonate with audiences around the world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Not enough words to describe how great this movie is.,"This is Disney's last masterpiece, and probably, the best animated feature from the past decade. The movie has it all: an excellent plot, perfect character description, amazing musical numbers, and excellent animations.The similarities between ""The Lion King"" and ""Hamlet"" are obvious but I must say that very different at the same time. ""Hamlet"" is a tale of ambition, lust, power, betrayal while ""The Lion King"" treats the same situations but such in a magical way that you can't help but adore.When I first watched this movie in theaters, I felt powerful. The events are dedicated 100% for children but adults can enjoy them too. To this day, I watch when possible this movie and it always makes me feel very good. This is in my opinion the best Disney movie you can find. Please, watch it because you will have a great, great time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
A timeless masterpiece,"I remember seeing it when I was a kid and I loved it. Then I saw it again as an adult, and I absolutely loved it: This have to be one of the best animated movies ever made.

""The Lion King"" it's a timeless animation made for people of all ages.A real shame Disney probably will never make any other film like this again. That company has lost all his magic (and the talent) it once had, focusing non-stop in making these dull live-action versions of their classics nobody asked.If only someone dared to make a great movie like this in the current era...We have the technology, but alas, big studios only care to make a maximum profit appealing to the lowest common denominator with zero regards to the art of animation.Time will pass, trends will die, but true art will remain.

With apologies to my friend Sara:,"Animation's crowning achievement? I don't think so!

If anything deserves to be called ""Animation's Crowning Achievement"", it's Beauty and the Beast (And I usually don't go around giving praise to Disney's non-Pixar films!). In that, you have a connection to the characters that is noticeably lacking in this film (And the music and story are better too.).The Lion King is ok, not great, but ten times better than its sequel.

The vocals, instrumentation and build up are also phenomenal and compliment the colourful visuals so well.Each and every voice actor is fantastic with favorites being James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons playing as Mufasa and Scar. Their voices are dark and they actually sound like Lions when they are talking.I love every character and how they interact with each other especially Mufasa and Simba, it's so well communicated how strong their relationship is. Scar is a passive agressive, intellegent and manipualtive villain. His charisma and manipulation really seperates him from other generic disney villains.

The Lion King- A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!,"'Hakuna Matata'. The motto of Timon and Pumbaa- the comedic duo of this wonderful film. These two words has to sum up what the film is about. When something goes wrong, don't worry about it. Everything will be alright. Disney's ability to convey deep, thematic scenarios does justice to it's story line and makes the audience feel every emotion you can think of.Simba (Matthew Broderick), a headstrong, young cub and son of Mufasa (James Earl Jones) is tricked into thinking that he is the cause of his father's death, thanks to his evil uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons). He therefore gets exiled and looses his identity as the future king. However, things turn around, when after a while, he realises the effect that it has on everyone within the kingdom. With Scar as the new 'king', will Simba be able to take his rightful place and king and stay true to who he really is, with the help of his friends; Nala (Moira Kelly), Rakifi (Robert Guillaume), Timon (Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella)?Disney's modern adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' in a unique and entertaining way, makes the audience see the deeper meaning of the film, along with making the film fun for the younger audience. Making the characters into animals, in my opinion, is the best thing that Disney could think of and I can see that they have done their research into the African lands and the characteristics of the animals living within. Even though the film deals with such major themes such as revenge, death and identity, the colourful characters like Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa makes the audience remember that this film is fiction. Scar, the antagonist in the film isn't a likable character, and it seems that his inspiration is from past Disney villains, like Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty), Captain Hook (Peter Pan) and Lady Tremaine (Cinderella).Everyone HAS to go and watch this film at least once. And after that... you will not be able to forget this epic story in your life(Which is a good thing!)",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
The Lion King - Some Nice Animation and Good Story Line,"Disney is used to making animated classics; but that should not diminish the praise they deserve when they occasionally rise above the norm in the genre on a yearly basis. This film exceeds the norm in several categories. The main character and his son are featured as the Lion King and cub, but the real backbone of the film are the funny supporting characters of the jungle, which include a snake, a funny boar, and a wise monkey (patented after the Chinese tradition of wise monkeys). Simba is a young cub. Who idolizes his father, and must take his place upon his father's death. The film highlights the problems of youth as they try to step into the shoes of others who have preceded them in life. It is not an easy task, and the film shows us why.

On the fence again!,"Well, once more I'm revisiting an old Disney movie that I haven't seen in a while but had memorized years ago.  And, again, I do not know what to say about our old buddy, Simba.First the good news.  This is still a great looking movie.  The opening sequence is still one of the most breathtaking pieces of animation ever made.  The score is also phenominal.However, of all the Disney movies of the early 90's, this is the one that has aged the least well.  The story really isn't all that original (can anyone say _Hamlet_?), and the characters are too derivative from other characters who were popular at the time (Timon and Pumbaa are essentially the nuetered Ren and Stimpy).  Furthermore, the much hyped celeberaty voice-overs are very distracting.  Who the hell casts Rowan ""Mr. Bean"" Atkinson for his *voice*?When all is said and done, ""Lion King"" makes for good eye-candy, but not much else.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

An African anthropomorphic animated epic from Disney now celebrates it's 20th anniversary!,"Back at the 1930s, a person named Walt Disney made his first company in the Hollywood industry known as the ""Walt Disney Animation Studios"". Then, after making a few animated shorts, they made their very first full length feature film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" based on a fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm. When it was first released, it was well-received globally from critics and audiences and started the trend, thus making the genre very successful. When Walt Disney died in 1966, however, Disney went towards the Dark Ages and were trying to find a way to get them back on track. Then, in 1989, when The Little Mermaid was released and became a hit, they started their new trend known as the Disney Renaissance with The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin. However, the only Renaissance film that was considered to be the most successful was this, ""The Lion King"", an anthropomorphic African feature film based on the religious stories of Joseph and Moses and also based on the Shakespearean play Hamlet.It tells the story about a young cub named Simba who's destined to become king of the jungle. However, his evil ruthless uncle Scar kills Simba's father Mufasa in a stampede of wildebeests and blames it on Simba, causing him to run away from Pride Rock. A few years later, after meeting two comic-relief sidekicks named Timon and Pumbaa, Simba grows up, away from responsibility. However, a wise baboon named Rafiki informs Simba that he has to take responsibility and return to Pride Rock to set things right.With that said, I want to sum up this film in only one word: fantastic. Not only is it one of Disney's best since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Bambi, Beauty and the Beast, and so on and so forth, but it's one of the best Disney Renaissance films, period. Thanks to it's reviews on Rottentomatoes, there are a lot of good things to say about it.The story is extremely compelling. Not only does it expand on the world it's created in Africa and it's Mythos, perfectly, but it does a great job at sending really good morals about responsibility and facing your past. Also, the mixture of comical moments along with some really dark ones (consider how this had a darker tone like ""The Black Cauldron"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" two years later) are blended perfectly to make it appeal to a family audience and it shows. Oh, and I also forgot to mention that this film has a notable scene where Simba cries over the death of his father, Mufasa and I gotta tell you, it made me shed some tears. No, really. I did.Anyway, the animation is breathtakingly beautiful. The world of Africa, Pride Rock, the Pride Lands, Scar's lair, the Elephant Graveyard, the Stampede scene, and the African Jungle where Timon and Pumbaa live are beautiful to look at even by 2D animation standards. Also, the character animation and designs are amazing and the facial expressions in them are solid.As for the characters, they're very likable. Simba, both child and adult, is nice it made me relate to him, Nala is also a good character both child and adult as well. The comic reliefs are also good. Timon and Pumbaa are extremely funny as is their chemistry together, Zazu is a very funny bird, and the three hyenas, Shenzai, Banzai, and Ed are laugh-out-loud hilarious. The characters that standout the most, however, would have to go to Mufasa, the intimidating, but wise father, Rafiki, the also wise baboon, and Scar, the ruthless uncle with great motives that explains why he wants to rule all of Pride Rock. The voice acting is top-notch with a killer cast including James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, and Matthew Broderick.The third and last thing would have to go to the music score from Hans Zimmer. This is the film that introduced me to this guy when I was a kid and I listened to his other scores for future movies such as the The Prince of Egypt, the Dark Knight Trilogy, the two Kung Fu Panda films, and Man of Steel (all of which were beautiful and solid that made those movies worth it). His score here, like the films that preceded this, is beautiful and compelling. It has an African choir, it helps represent the themes perfectly and the action music is thrilling it would send chills down your spine. The songs, written by Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, are wonderful and will always be timeless. The Circle of Life opens the film very brilliantly, I Just Can't Wait To Be King is good with an upbeat tone, Be Prepared, a creepy, but spine-tingly awesome, Hakuna Matata is a pretty good comedy song that means no worries to me, & Can You Feel The Love Tonight is a solid romance song that represents Simba's relationship with Nala very well.Overall, The Lion King has been a childhood favorite of mine and as a young adult, it still holds up along with Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and all of the other Disney films in the past. It's compelling, it's epic, it's beautiful, and it's a sight that you'll never want to miss. To those who are Disney fans, go watch it. To those who aren't, however, still go watch it. A solid recommendation! :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Overrated TRASH!!!,"How overrated can a rubbish film like this get?! It's a mess, it's depressing, it's got dumb comedy - there's only one three good points about this movie and that is the animation, the appealing drama of the stampede scene and a few of the songs; ""Can you feel the love tonight?"", ""I just can't wait to be King!"" and ""Be Prepared"" the rest is simply repelling. I'm a spoilsport - I know! Because everyone else looks at ""The Lion King"" with awe but I DO think you need to realise the many poor points to this Carlton-film:1. Terrible voice talents 2. Timon and Pumbaa are extremely annoying, offensive to the ears and just plain stupid 3. Simba would rather spend time with Timon and Pumbaa than go to his home at the Pride-Lands where he is desperately needed 4. Scar is also madly irritating rather than a frightening villain 5. Comedy that is stupid rather than funny 6. Adult Simba, it seems to me, so sugary and sentimental 7. Scenes of death 8. Immense depression as Mufasa is killed 9. The hyenas - those annoying, moronic hyena, especially the thorn pit scene! 10. Everyone is intimidated by Scar who, like I say, isn't even slightly scary 11.

Hugely undeserving of all the people of this town giving up their time to see it. They're nutty as a fruitcake, if you ask ME! Even though, unlike Richard Aird hopeless, brainless, pointless, pitiful pantomime, Disney's ""Lion King"" has a professional production, reasonable animation, good drama, and admirable songs, it simply can't stand comparison with Disney's recent animated hits like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"" - it's too obnoxious and depressing!",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

"One of the finest, by any standard you care to set","By the year 1994, The Walt Disney Animation Studio had been split in two. The A-team was working on Pocahontas, which was supposed to be their ultimate magnum opus, their new Sleeping Beauty, which would set the standard for animated movie greatness. Whereas the B-team was working on The Lion King, to give the audiences something to tide them over until Pocahontas would sweep them off their feet.It's funny how these things work out sometimes. How blind people can be to their own work.Because The Lion King was huge when it came out. It was a cultural phenomenon equally as groundbreaking as Jurassic Park a year earlier, and Disney would have to wait almost two decades until Frozen came along to achieve the same kind of wall to wall cultural hype that followed this movie from day one. And you know what? It earned that hype and recognition. It is a masterpiece, one of those perfect films that populate people's top lists. And it doesn't earn that through harsh themes, dark characters and cold, realistic truths about the human condition. It has those, being one of the most mature Disney films ever made, but at its core it's a movie about triumph, about accepting responsibility, about the fact that it's okay to be afraid, shocked and ashamed, but that at some point you have to well, let it go.It's also one of the most colourful Disney films, with an amazing cast of identifiable, likable and instantly recognizable characters. All of its songs are born classics, the sound design in general is phenomenal, as is the voice acting. The story flows seamlessly and goes to some pretty dark places for an animated family film, but it never feels like it's unfair or doing it for the wrong reasons. It has dark scenes and themes because at some point kids need learn about them, and this is the perfect film to teach them.The Lion King is my favourite Disney film. Has always been. It taught me that what I did or, even more importantly, didn't do affected not just me but all those around me. It taught me that those around me affect me as well and I should be respectful of the fact, of those connections. It taught me about bravery, friendship and family. It taught me that sometime truths can be used to manipulate people and that sometimes a lie is the sweetest truth there is. It is an important part of who I am today, and because of that it has my respect and love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

The movie you can say really opens spectacularly.Each scene depicted in this movie is fabulous with the emotional scenes being really powerful I have watched this movie countless number of times and each time the enjoyment factor is still there.In other words this film has a high repeat value I would recommend every parent out there to show this movie to your child. It will be a treat for himThe music is really on another level.

And this is the one,"If you didn't guess, this is that one Disney film that I don't think will ever be beaten. At least not by anything they're squirting out nowadays.And while thinking about what sets it apart and elevates it to that level when compared to the other Disney films I've talked about recently, I came to the conclusion that it's because none of the protagonists in those films have a real arc. Seriously, think about it. Snow White is always a nice, helpful person, Peter Pan is always heroic (and if you want to tell me Wendy is actually the main character then she always believes in Peter Pan), Mowgli is adamant he's staying in the jungle right until the end of the film, and Ariel is always fascinated by the human world, and gets to live in it happily ever after by the end.But something that I feel isn't typically recognised about this one is that Simba is a spoiled little unlikable brat right up until *that* moment, and only then does the titular ""lion king"" start to come out of him.But at the same time, he doesn't make the first act of the film unbearable, because the other characters are so memorable and charismatic, the cast is one of the best ever assembled for an animated film, the animation is absolutely stunning and that m u s i c. I don't mean just the songs, although they're all great too, I mean the score by Hans Zimmer is easily one of, if not his absolute best.And the whole thing just feels so much more mature and epic than anything else I've seen from Disney, I mean there's even a little bit of symbolism sometimes, that most kids' films just won't bother with.And it's so much better directed than any of those other films I mentioned to boot, so yeah. As far as I'm concerned, this is peak Disney, and you can absolutely yeet the remake off of Pride Rock.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Disney at it's worst,"I'm not going to apologize to any of the idiots who may get offended by this comment. The Lion King is a really really really dumb movie. It is crap. The plot is extremely superficial and the characters are all so quickly spun and consistently shallow that by the end of the film I couldn't care less who won the day. To be honest I was rooting for Scar (at least he had the cool creepy voice).Raves about the celebrity voices? I'd rather have people I don't know speaking the lines. It gets distracting when you know that the hero is Matthew Broderick, or the villain is Jeremy Irons or Whoopi Goldberg, or whoever. And since when are all African lions American or British?Raves about the songs?! THEY ALL SUCKED. I only remember three of the songs (were there more?) The circle of life (even I have to admit that the first 5 five minutes of the movie were impressive), I Can't Wait to be King (possibly - no certainly - the most annoying song ever to be created by Disney, topped by the most out-of-place and contrived dance scene, and it was also reminiscent of the Beauty and the Beast classic Be Our Guest...extremely tacky, all in all), and Hakkuna Matata, which almost ties for most annoying song, because for years it was being shoved down the public's throat through toy and soundtrack promotions.I am a huge Disney fan, but this movie made me doubt my allegiance. To all duped consumers out there: If you want to see good Disney; if you want a movie that will entertain children and adults; if you want to hear good songs; if you want developed lead and secondary characters; if you want to see a plot with more dimensions than a sheet of paper; then see Beauty and the Beast, or The Little Mermaid, or Aladdin.

As good as I Remember It,"Great songs and musical score. Like all great movies, the sum of it's parts make it greater that it's whole. Great characterizations by amazing voice actors. Terrific story-line, although shamelessly borrowed from several literary sources, including Shakespeare! A truly disturbing death scene when Mufasa, the Lion King, dies. (Shades of Bambi!) Tim Rice and Elton John wrote very memorable songs, indeed. Classic intricately detailed ink-and-paint 2D animation at it's best. James Earl Jones in one of his best roles ever. Probably not recommend for very young children due to a few intense scenes, although mixed in with much humor and majesty. Whoopie Goldberg steals the scene (like she does in most of her movies) as a very outspoken hyena. Just wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Where do I even begin???,"I guess from the first 20 seconds. The sun rises and you her aaaaaaaaaaaaa and you just know Disney peaked here. The Lion King is by far one of the greatest Disney Films of all time. First of all, the aesthetic of this movie just hits. Any fan art or professional art for the Lion King is always stunning. Artists just go all in for Lion King art and I love it. Even at Walt Disney World, looking around Animal Kingdom, Animal kingdom Lodge, & Art of Animation, Lion King just makes everything better.I think what really resonates with most people is how mature the story is. It's a bunch of talking animals but the target audience is not specifically kids. You look at past movies like Aristocats or Oliver & Company - those are cute family fun animal movies. The Lion King is serious... like.... the stampede. The murder. Simba's realization. Disney chose trauma this day, and we all felt that. This came with timeless life lessons very often quoted. Of course the classic - Hakuna Matata - which translates to ""put your behind in your past."" The past can hurt, but you can either run from it or learn from it. When we die we become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass. The one that hits me most is ""remember who you are."" Because in the everchanging life we live, we are who we are, take that as you will.On top of the epic tale is one of the greatest film soundtracks I've ever heard in my life. Hans Zimmer peaked here. All the Light Touches gets me every time. And the iconic songs are you kidding me?!?!?!! The Circle of Life, Just Can't Wait To Be King, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, Can You Feel the Love Tonight - every song is a hit for no reason.This movie was completely revolutionary in more so than any other from the renaissance era. Just thinking about it - within the next several years upon it's release, Animal Kingdom was built, Disney's wildlife charity started, and to this day, Simba is still on an insane amount of merch. The legacy is there. And the lion king will always be my number 1.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Lion King, similar to Hamlet?","I would like to know if anyone else agrees with me.  Is THE LION KING similar to Shakespeare's HAMLET?  I think there are many striking resemblances.

Of course that is not the only similarity. If you agree with me, let me know.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

This movie has even impacted how I want to spend my life when I get out of school. Before I found out about the Broadway production of this play, I didn't know anything about theatre, but because The Lion King was made into a Broadway adaptation, I have developed a love for the theatre. While I still haven't fulfilled my dream of seeing the stage adaptation of this movie, I do have a passion for other parts of theatre, both being on stage and off and plan to major in performing arts in college. I fully believe that if it were not for my love of this movie that I would not have this passion today. The movie itself though is, in my opinion, the best Disney movie every.

The king is still roaring loud,"Turn up the word ""excellent film"" in the wordbook and you'll find ""The Lion King"", who has earned it's reputation as Disney's most successful animated feature ever. As a child I was fan to the old Disney features like ""Bambi"", ""Jungle Book"" and etc, but ""Lion King"" was the first of the ""newest"" Disney features who I really got hooked on (except ""Rescuers Down Under""). I liked ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"", but they weren't my favorites (""Beauty and the Beast"" I liked when I was older, since it's a more mature movie).I remember seeing ""Lion King"" in theaters when I was 10 and it was a life experience. I was totally blown away of the opening and the rest of the film. I got tears of the sad moments and laughed a lot of the funny moments.Afterwards I saw this movie many times on VHS and as a teenager I was taking care of some kids who saw ""The Lion King"" over and over again as well. So I got really sick of it.But I'm still enjoying it this movie now. ""Lion King"" has some of the greatest moments in Disney history ever. My favorite characters are Simba, Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa. Scar is a good and unusual villain, although he's never been my favorite Disney villain. As a kid I liked the hyenas, but now I think they're annoying.The songs are very memorable (except ""Be Prepared""), ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" is one of the most beautiful love songs ever. The score of Hans Zimmer is also great. The animation is absolutely stunning and gorgeous.It's ironic to think that this film, who is based on a loose script (ok, it's has borrowed from other stories), was going to be Disney's most successful financial feature ever. The only bad thing in this movie it's the moral becomes a little bit overwhelming beyond the story. Besides that, Lion King it's a excellent movie and it's a shame that the movies afterwards didn't restore Disney's reputation (even some of those movies were great).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Perfection,"The best animated film ever made. One of the best films in history.I don't find many films perfect, but this is one of those. So many people say this is still as powerful as it was when it was released and I agree. Obviously because of the story, the lesson and the always timely themes. But not only that. This film is a miracle in the way that is never too adult for a child and never too childish for an adult and that is one of it's biggest achievements that I don't see in many animated films.Every character has a strong identity and arc, every single scene works, every song is beautiful and memorable (these could have all the nods for best song in a year), every line thoughtful and/or funny, always masterfully crafted with a perfect pace, great direction and flawless editing.I'm Portuguese, so the PT/PT version is the one that makes me more excited and I enjoy the most, so, even if I've watched the original voices and liked it, nothing beats the feeling of hearing the fantastic dub made by these Portuguese artists, probably the best PT/PT version of any film in history.Disney made some of the best animated films in history. They were always able to put on screen stories that are simultaneously interesting, funny, full of meaning and relatable, however, there is no other on this level.

The music bugged me... and story lacked,"I'm probably alone on this, but the music was just corny. Too broadway for my taste. Just not sure why this gets so much praise. It totally lacks the magic old Disney films had.Just when something decent started they jumped into a dance and a song. Not much of a fan of musicals, so this didn't help.Why does one lion speak with an American accent but his brother (scar) with an English one? Did they not spend two seconds thinking about these things? All the voices were done so woodenly. Did they just read off a paper without any natural delivery. Because of the bad acting and it just didn't connect on a real BELIEVABLE emotional level. Whenever you see (hear in this case) bad acting it almost becomes a joke.There was just a lack of story and character development. It. It went too quick into the conflict between the two lion brothers and then it seemed non-stop trying to kill Simba and the King. The story was just the wrong one, OR, it was just poorly structured and executed. They should have started it with Simba and his friendship and follow him as he learns the ways of the jungle. Instead we got 40 minutes of them trying to kill him before we even get some remotely interesting.Just because it's animation doesn't mean you need to throw out basic story telling. This was just too simple and not in a good way, but in a hollow way.The amount of praise this has gotten is a reflection of how little it takes to impress people.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

I believe that the animals in the movies also offer a certain mysticism that contributes to the magic of what Disney and Disneyland is today.

The Last Great Hand-Drawn Animated Film from Disney,"Throughout the early 1990s, Disney animation appeared to be unstoppable. ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" in quick succession had set a new standard for animation. Unfortunately for Disney, ""The Lion King"" would be its last hurrah for a while, or really for good. Pixar would soon pick up the torch, and now Pixar is king of the jungle.But as for ""The Lion King"".......""Beauty and the Beast"" is probably my favorite Disney animated film, but this one is a close second. It's the darkest and most ambitious and it's got superb animation. The song score by Elton John is the weakest in the above-mentioned string of films, but the orchestral score by Hans Zimmer is the best.

a bit mundane,"The Lion King, while being consistently entertaining, ends up being kind of disappointing by the end. The reasons for this are many and varied.First off, the film is very short. Only 88 minutes. I do not know why, but I thought that this film was supposed to be about 2 hours long. I think it is because I have always heard how much of an epic quality the film had. This is simply untrue. The film has very little in the way of script. Not much really happens in the film. You could probably sum up in only a couple of sentences.The characters and situations of the film are somewhat trite. It is unfair to dismiss this category of criticism because this a children's cartoon. The heroes and villains of other Disney films are much less formulaic, as well as the challenges they encounter (e.g., The Little Mermaid, Pinnochio, Beauty and the Beast).  Simba's challenge was a bit interesting, but, as I complained above, it is brought up and resolved in a half-hour's time. The only characters I found really interesting were the villains, and not Scar, but the Heyenas.It is this third complaint which actually pushed me into the realm of disliking this film: the music. I've always felt that the music of Disney's animated fare was bad. There are three exceptions I can think of offhand: The Little Mermaid, Pinnochio, and the Jungle Book. All other Disney animated films have a collection of some of the worst music that has ever been produced. I think The Lion King takes the cake for general rottenness in the music department. There was not one song that did not make me cringe.All in all, surely the Lion King is okay for kids, but there are so many better films, even from Disney's canon, that one should expose their children to. My suggestions are any of those Disney films I've listed as good above. As for non-Disney films, I think My Neighbor Totoro (age range 2-10, I would say) and Kiki's Delivery Service (age range 6-18; the best lessons ever of responsibility and self-reliance are found in this film), both from Japan but also both easily available in any video store dubbed into English, are the two best films for children ever made. Also, The Prince of Egypt is pretty good for slightly older children (I would put The Lion King in the 3-8 age range and The Prince of Egypt from 9-13). I give The Lion King 5/10 = good for children, pretty uninteresting to adults.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
The best of all time,"It's epic by Disney introduced in 1994 and like snow white and the seven dwarfs and cinderella I saw the lion king thousand times but the only difference is the rewatching value the story is more logic and fits the adults more and the characters are wonderful, interesting and great Simba's journey to discover himself and face his past is so deep and anyone can get it with everyone develoe through the movie and the introduction of the most evil character in Disney history in Addition to the great animation which made difference in the animation industry with great soundtracks and epic music and all of this in 1h28m that made the movie epic with great voice acting especially Jeremy irons.

Disney's The Lion King took the country by storm.,"It amassed more than $100 million in just a few weeks. The songs by Tim Rice and Elton John may not be up to those penned by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken for Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin, but otherwise this Lion is a charmer. Marvelous animation, and what a cast! James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Guillaume, Jeremy Irons, Madge Sinclair, Rowan Atkinson, Nathan Lane and Cheech Marin. Well, their voices, anyway.Yes, there is a little bit of Hamlet in the plot, as Mufasa, the lion king, is done in by his ambitious, scheming, brother Scar, who wants to sit on the throne. Scar and his hyena followers then go after Mufasa's rightful successor and son, the cuddly lion cub Simba. Thankfully, Scar doesn't marry Simba's mother, and the cub's childhood sweetheart, Nala, doesn't go bonkers and jump in the river. This is Disney, after all, so you can rest assured that the tragedy will eventually find its way to a silver lining and a happy ending. There are lots of laughs along the way with the cheeky meerkat Timon (Lane) providing more than his share. He and a worm-eating warthog named Pumbaa get to sing an infectious ditty called ""Hakuna Matata,"" which is translated as, ""Don't worry, be happy."" Parents shouldn't be surprised if they are called upon to see it more than once. No problem. Hakuna matata.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Masterpiece...,"""The Lion King"" is an Animation - Drama movie in which we follow story of Simba, a young lion who must reclaim his rightful place as king after the tragic death of his father, Mufasa.I enjoyed this animation movie very much and till today I consider it one of the best if not the best animation movie. This movie combined very well family, loss, and redemption and at the same time it wasn't just emotionally powerful but also visually stunning. The animation was breathtaking, with vibrant colors that brought the African savanna to life, complemented by a stunning musical score by Hans Zimmer and iconic songs like ""Circle of Life"" and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"". The emotional depth of the story, paired with themes of responsibility, self-discovery, and the circle of life, resonated with audiences of all ages. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Lion King"" is a timeless classic and not only entertains but also offers profound lessons about life and legacy so, I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
A ripped-off masterpiece,"This wonderous 2D film filled with magnificent melodies (with some exceptions...) is, in fact, a complete ripoff story-wise. You probably haven't heard of Osamu Tezuka or Kimba (I'm 14 and I notice not many adults, much less peers, are aware of this) and Kimba's now available on DVD. But that's not a suggestion. Trust me on this. Just do some research, but don't get too judgemental. Moving on. I've always had a preference for 2D (When I was 5 I was just THRILLED about CGI...But now it sucks.) so I undoubtedly started collecting all sorts of well-made flicks (My collection's not that big yet, I just started and in fact made a mistake...Thank god Quest for camelot was only 5 bucks.) so I undoubtedly got this one. SE is certainly a real collector's piece. Ignore those retarded stereotypes about kid's movies. Here's the laws of kid's movies: It's animated. It's G. It's intended for adults. Therefore it's marketed towards children (i.e. All Dogs go to Heaven). Matthew Broderick and Moira Kelley are both appallingly untalented in here, but you hafta admit, you won't even care. And don't watch ""Morning Report"". Just some final words of advice. Oh, and for you 2D-lovin' fanatics out there: Mark Henn, Andreas Deja, and Ruben Aquino.

In response to people dismissing Lion King as 'Macbeth with lions,' I don't think that's inherently a bad thing.

What Lion King does is take a story of familial betrayal and create a wonderful movie that is truly fit for all ages. As a kid, I related to young Simba, a child who greatly respects his father and struggles to understand what it means to be a great leader and father. As an adult millennial, when I rewatch the movie I relate to adult Simba's struggles to find confidence in himself and fulfill his responsibilities.

One if the Greats,"The Lion King is a Disney classic. The young cub, Simba (voice of Jonathan Taylor Thomas), will one day inherit the Pride Land. That is until Scar, Simba's uncle (voice of Jeremy Irons), selfishly intervenes. With Mufasa, Simba's father (voice of James Earl Jones) out of the picture, Simba believes that Scar's doings are all his fault as he retreats to the desert. In the desert he finds an oasis where he befriends Timon and Pumbaa (voices of Nate Lane and Ernie Sabella). Simba, (voice of Matthew Broaderick), grows up as years pass and Scar is ruling over the Pride Land in the place of Mufasa. Living in the poor conditions Scar has provided Nala, a friend from Simba's childhood (voice of Moria Kelly), sets out to find the lost Prince. Once she discovers what Simba has retreated to, she begins to talk sense into him and brings him home to reclaim what was rightfully his.The Lion King is a G rated film falling in the category of kid friendly and family night approved. This movie will take you on a musical journey. The soundtracks are catchy and also let you dip your feet into a different kind of culture. While watching this movie you can instantly tell this is a Disney classic. The animation is full of color and all sorts of different animals. In the opening scenes you almost feel as if you are there in Africa, with the way the animators made everything look so life like. Both the animation and the sound tracks will entertain your children for hours. Directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff did a fantastic job stringing together a beautiful story line enhanced with great visual and auditory effects. This movie wasn't just created for children either, there is a deeper connection as well. As a child watching this movie I never acknowledged or even knew why Simba coming back to claim what was his was such a big deal. Now as I've experienced a little bit of life I've learned that running away from a problem isn't going to fix anything. Mistakes are apart of being human. Introducing this idea to children at a young age may have long term effects. I think that the messages behind this film are so important. As a child, even now, I still need to be reminded to keeping fighting and to fight to the end for what's mine. That isn't the only message hidden within The Lion King. There are also messages parallel to the Bible too. An example of this being Simba running from his problems, he was scared but also ashamed. I related this to the devil wanting us to be so consumed with shame that we run too. After seeing almost every Disney movie out there, you could say I'm rather experienced. With that being said The Lion King is probably one of my favorite Disney movies. I loved it as a child when bright colors and peppy music were my thing, but now I love it more for the deeper connections I see. I give this movie a rating of a perfect ten. From the story line to the animation to the thoughts behind the movie, I love it!! I don't believe anyone would argue, after seeing the film that it is one of the greatest children's movies out there to this day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Good film but overrated,"I don't want to sound really negative, so let me begin by saying that this is a very good Disney film, undeniably. Probably the best thing about this film is that it has possibly the best animation of any Pre-Pixar Disney film to date. I would also place its score by Hans Zimmer and songs by Elton John/Tim Rice in the top 5 of Disney films.However, this is OVERRATED (The only Disney animated one to be moreso than Beauty and the Beast, which is also a great film nevertheless). People call it the best Disney animated feature, but they should really look at some other of Disney's films. I would undoubtedly place this in the Top Ten, but don't immediately call it the best, because you'd be surprised what watching some other items from the Mouse Factory would do to your opinion. My biggest complaint is the story and how it is told. Does anyone besides myself realize that this is a Hamlet ripoff? First original Disney film indeed, Aladdin put much more story creativity into its adaptation of Arabian Nights. And this film can be a little slow at times. Aladdin is 90 minutes long, TLK 88, but sometimes I feel like TLK is 2 hours long, while Aladdin is maybe a 1/2 hour.Don't let this misguide you, I love the film, and it rightfully earns a 10/10. But I do not think it deserves as much acclaim as it has received.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Astonishing film of all centuries,"On June ,1994 Disney directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff creates one of the most breathtaking and legendary movies of all centuries.For my childish mind at that time this was a huge amazement and wonder ,not only because it was greatly animated film ,but also due to the fact that scriptwriters had made an excellent work while writing the plot.This Walt Disney presentation should have cut a huge swathe through all age groups .Young children and adults alike well warn to its nourishingly wise storyline.
A film that only get better with repeat viewings and age, The Lion King is a fantastic animated masterpiece that is among Disney's finest achievements. Stellar voice work, great musical score, beautiful to look at and emotionally complex and riveting. Questions which their parents will have to answer. Dad, is Mufasa really dead? Can this happen? He is the king!
The Lion King is a fun, often funny, and at some times tragic animation and some of the most iconic movie moments in cinema. The music in this film is just so iconic and no matter what generation you are a part of you have heard these songs more than once. n't really hear it. This film has a great message in it that you shouldn't run away from your problems but deal with them right then and there in the present. In the end, this film is perfect for anybody and everybody.Diana :)
Disney is one of the few animation companies that creates animated films not only for children, but also for adults. The creations of the studio evoke a wide range of emotions in people of all ages. And here it doesn't matter how old you are. The important thing is that they leave a huge impression after viewing.
The lion king is one of the most popular animated films that are remembered for all time. This animation is both soulful, sincere and heartbreaking, as it describes the full path of becoming the lion king. Everyone will find his own in it. And thanks to this style, Walt Disney became famous throughout the world.
The ""Lion king"" is an allegory. The main characters in the film are exclusively the inhabitants of the African savannah. Mufasa, the father of Simba, is the personification of power: the majestic and strong king of . Sherkhan is the exact opposite, cunning, greedy and envious. Given the fact that the Lion King is one of the few cartoons in which, looking at the characters, you can see people. As we can see all the best and worst human qualities are transferred to the screen, and the viewer sees people in animals.
The Lion King is an amazing cartoon. The whole picture is wonderful in it: landscapes of Africa, portrayal of characters; music by the talented Hanz Zimmer and songs performed by Elton John; humor and, of course, the plot itself.
""The Lion King"" is a masterpiece of world animation, which is known and loved all over the world, therefore I advise everyone, even strongly recommend viewing it to both children and adults.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

We learned about right and wrong and the importance of following your heart. t has everything from youthful naiveté to unforeseen loss and betrayal, all things we face in life.

A timeless masterpiece,"""The Lion King,"" released in 1994, is a Disney animated classic that has captivated audiences for decades with its powerful storytelling, memorable characters, and breathtaking animation. The film follows the journey of Simba, a young lion destined to become king, as he navigates the challenges of life, loss, and redemption.The voice cast is stellar, with standout performances by James Earl Jones as Mufasa, Jeremy Irons as the villainous Scar, and Matthew Broderick as the adult Simba.

"Over 20 years on, The Lion King is still a masterpiece","The Lion King is undoubtedly one of Disney's greatest accomplishments. Packed full of compelling characters, exciting animation and an incredible, award winning soundtrack, this film is sure to delight both children and adults. Whilst the vibrant colours and animals attract and demand the attention of younger audiences, adults are sure to enjoy the sometimes philosophical messages and questions that this film suggests-making this a film for all the family to enjoy.This film's storyline is downright Shakespearian at times (as it even draws inspiration from Hamlet), focusing on the power struggles between the generations in a royal family, set against the backdrop of the African pride lands. The strong storyline ensures that this film is not overshadowed by its soundtrack; something which would have easily occurred due to the instantly iconic songs filling this film.Another area that this film gets spot on is the characters, with their personalities and flaws which are all too easy to relate to. While the protagonist is certainly interesting and well voiced, the true stars of this film are the side characters, who are all handled in their own right. From the wise and powerful father figure of Mufasa to the comedic duo of Timon and Pumba, not to mention the witch doctor monkey Rafiki, this film gets everyone right. The villain is also extremely entertaining and memorable (if a little intimidating to young children at times).The soundtrack of The Lion King is again incredibly strong, with even the 'weaker' songs still being enjoyable and not out of place. The beginning scene, featuring the well-known 'Circle of Life' is a cinematic delight, featuring beautifully crafted animation and the perfect introduction to this film. The Oscar winning 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' is again brilliant, but perhaps the uplifting 'Hakuna Matata' is the true musical highlight.The Lion King is full of poignant themes and lines, which older viewers can certainly appreciate. Disney has not since this film been able to replicate what this film achieves, and this animated classic will surely stay that way for many years to come. So if for whatever reason you haven't seen The Lion King yet, don't miss out on one of Disney's greatest films ever.

Disney's return to Grrreatness!,"The first Disney animated film with no human characters and to be based on an original story is an overwhelming success not only in the box office but as a movie. A lion cub, Simba, is next in line to be Lion King, until his evil uncle Scar, (voiced superbly villanously by Jeremy Irons) plots a coup agains the future king. Along the way we see Simba growing up and discovering the not so perfect world. A great story with a detailed plot that will have you engrossed. The songs are perfectly done, with Elton John singing the themes ""can you feel the love tonight?"" and ""Circle of life"".A classic that rivals any of Disney's older masterpieces. Followed by a good but less effective sequel. On a scale of one to ten..8",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
The Best Animated Film I Have Ever Seen,"I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen. It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget.The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! I really enjoyed it when I first seen it, about when I was 6, and since then I watched it over and over again.This is one movie where you can feel for the characters. You don't say 'haha, he's dead', you say 'Gasp! I'm so sad!' If it weren't for the gifted scriptwriters, this movie would be kaput and a nothing, not the best Disney movie ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
A great movie for all ages,"The Lion King is a great movie for anyone to see.  It has suspense, drama, and will pull on anyone who has an open heart's emotional strings, so to speak.Anyone who has seen the movie and liked it would have to agree that it is definately one of the best animated movies ever.Basically without many details, The Lion King is about a young lion cub who is destined to become king, whether he likes it or not.  It will always remain a true masterpeice in my eyes.As far as Problems with the movie I see absolutely none.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Life changing,"The Lion King is a movie about teachings, it can, and probably will, change your life for good, if you really understand what it is about, wich is very easy, you will talk with your familly with a different way, you will valorize them much more, your familly and friends, just everybody you trully like and love. It shows that our passing through here will end, we born, learn, grow, conquer and go away, it's like the Circle of life. There are dialogues during the movie that teaches how to handle mourning, that calm down and really help people that are struggling with something rough. As we accompany Simba on his journey to become a true King, we gonna feel in our on skin, the rage that some characters pass, the true sadness as if we have lost a friend or a relative, that really maked me cry so hard that my face got bugged, the happiness of a true friendship that makes me laugh and feel so well. It's a mix of emotions in their most sincere way.
The movie works 100% both for kids and adults, having aspects that they both gonna take and will touch their feelings. A very important quote on the movie, that is even more important for kids, is that you have to obey your parents, you have to trust in them, otherwise you gonna put yourself in danger and with problems. There is one specific moment that Simba say to Mufasa that they gonna play together forever, and Mufasa just say and prepare his son to his death, showing for us also, that one day our loved ones also gonna go, but at the same time it declares that they gonna live forever on the sky and will always be watching for us, very emotional and important moment. And later on the movie, Simba look at a reflection of himself and se his father, showing that our ones that are already gone will always live in us forever and be part of everything that we are.
Another very important matter that will impacts in literally all of us, independent of the age or anything, is about the past. Sometimes we need to change, wich is good, but is hard, because of our past most of the time, that we runs away from it. And we have to choose if we gonna run away or face it and learn with it. Also that you can't forget who you are and from where did you came from, DON'T FORGET WHO YOU ARE. Confront your guilt, assume your role in life and grow, mature. Face what there is new in life, not fear it, but go into it.
The characters Timon and Pumba are just genious, just like that, two great philosophers, all about the Hakuna Matata thing, is a thing you take for your life, that bad things happen, but head up and keep going, a not worries, problem-free.. maybe true happiness.
Even with all that said, all the things that it teachs that are completely necessary for life, it also have a great story, cleary based on Hamlet and Kimba for example, even if Disney don't admits it, with great characters every single one having their purpose that are all perfectly done and interpretate. The viusuals are all great, the visuals are stunning, showing the hole environment. They introduced a lot of animals, showing how some respect the king, how some hate it, show that some animals are marginals, they don't rock with the rest of the forest, demonstrating that some places are nice and others aren't, it is all much well done in just 1h30min. all worked out. With possibly the best prologue ever made. It shows the time passing, the transition between Simba kid and adult, happens in a brillaint way, inserting into the music, it is natural, doesn't seem any strange or wrong, you can feel the time. The villain is great, you see how Scar is moved by jealousy, he does his wickedness with something behind it all, he is frightener and you will hate him, he is pure evil and manipulative, when he shows up, the colors refers to hell, with red collors, and sometimes refering even to nazism, Scar is that big one as a villain.
Now the soundtracks are phenomenal, Hans Zimmer did a job that is at the same level as the entire movie, it just makes it even more great, the song will talk to us during the hole movie in a way that really a very few movies does, will make us scary or even more sad than we already were because of the scene for example, in some moments of dialogue he takes the violin into a hole other level that the music kind feel like is one with everything, is perfect. The musics are phenomenal and so memorable, that you just don't stop singing never ever in your life again, once that you watch it in any language, it will be stucked in your mind, together with all the feelings of the moments. The musics pretty much help to give us an entertaining teaching, all the musics lycris have a meaning that will help you to get all thoose teaching that i did mentioned before.
The Lion King is one of the movies that is just necessary for you to watch by yourself, and principally to watch with your kids, once that you got kids, watch it with them, multiple times, it will make their lifes more complety and understandable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

THe Great Circle of Life..,"One of the greatest animated films no doubt about it. Rarely do animated shows and movies nowadays live up to expectations for both kids and adults. The Lion King is a classic animated film that has been prasied and loved by the Disney fandom for more than 20 years and one that was a gamechanger for Disney.Solid story that has a great adaptive atmosphere and writing. The song scenes were very good and for a kids movie it had very good emotional emphasis. The characters were well written. Couple of the best were Simba, the banished prince/king. Scar, the manipulative/evil uncle. And Rafiki the wise/funny grandpa you wished you had. The visuals were impressive considering this was made in the 90s, very high quaility with likable artstyle and character design. And lastly the music was awesome mixed with african drum beats and a great voice acting cast.Overall an enjoyable movie Both old and young will find this film likable.Memorable: So so (Nostalgia) Rewatchble: Maybe..",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
A Shakespeare inspired story told in beautiful narrative,"What an interesting (and albeit fun) way to tell Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" in a cartoonish fashion set in the Animal Kingdom.Yet, despite the familiar base story, it came out EPIC as hell-- Becoming one of Disney's best animated films ever produced! (Explanation followed~)You know a movie is just darn good when it leaves you emotionally riled up each time you watch it. And Lion King just does that.
Especially the beginning, the goosebumps-- *shivers*
But apart from the epic narrative, the morale in it as just as powerful: ""Remembeing who you are and that running away from your past / responsibilities won't fix anything. Instead embrace your past mistakes, learn from it and move on. Also remembering that worrying most of the time won't help either. Remeber to have fun once in a while.(Hakuna Matata!)Growing up with this movie has been one hell of a ride, and continues to leave me feeling thrilled each time. (25 yo and still not tired of it!).

A Timeless Classic,This movie will forever be a Disney favorite for generations to come.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"The Lion King is the legitimate representative of the Golden Age of Disney, full of endearing characters, with traditional and efficient lessons of life, ethics and morals","Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff debuted in feature films addressing this timeless story and dramatic, discussing loss, family relationship, inspired courage and honor in the play Hamlet by William Shakespeare, the movie Bambi, and the stories of Joseph and Moses, the Bible, and without forgetting the traditional moral message of Disney to your audience. The studio brought together more than 800 artists across three continents, who worked three years to create a story of love, friendship, courage and teachings that enchanted the world. Only the creative part, the film proves to be one of the great examples of collaboration in your script, with almost 30 professionals who helped in creating the plot, which had as main writers trio Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton.The quality of the animation is a unique treatment, emphasizing the full power of Disney to represent the entire African savanna, a scene never before explored in animations. For both the studio took about three years in the production of the film.Another great merit of encouraging merge was wild with human bodily expressions, especially in animals over humans as Zazu, Scar and Timon (probably because they are the most cowardly and rational characters). Zazu crosses wings, holds the bars of his cage and has very human facial expressions. Scar gestures legs and caresses Simba gestures typically human. Timon is the clearest example. He exaggerated gestures, crosses his legs, among other various facial expressions. At some point - when Simba is to be reprimanded by her father after he disobeyed and went to the Elephant Graveyard - he is afraid of his father and lowers the tail and ears and walks with a stooped posture. Soon after, when they play, both assume new postures amid wild somersaults and bites. The other characters show humanity in its looks and typically human care, such as when the mother of Simba, Sarabi, conversation with the mother of Nala allowing them to walk around, but accompanied by Zazu, demonstrating the inherent concern as mothers.The characters, however, are the secret of the plot. Besides the technique with which they were made, their personalities are captivating, and helped a lot by excellent team of voice actors. Zazu, voiced by Rowan Atkinson - Mr. Bean's famous - is the faithful servant of King Mufasa, that puts all confidence in the bird. Atkinson lends distinctive voice and mannerisms comedic giving a unique personality to the character. James Earl Jones with his distinctive voice is the one who gives life to Mufasa. The actor - who is also the voice of Darth Vader in ""Star Wars"" - is the ideal choice for the majesty of the king of the jungle. The character always keeps a didactic discourse during the movie. His strong voice while loving, especially in the speeches with Simba are some of the best moments. The life lessons he gives Simba directly reflect the audience and only serve to further admire the great king and to engage deeply in the episode of his death. This scene, by the way, is one of the most remembered and have become classic to the seventh art. Jeremy Irons is one that is flawless. Always maintaining a drawling voice, dramatic and that suits the way slim, lazy and treacherous brother Mufasa. Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays a charming Simba, a young lion that giving all the curious spirit of age. Simba is adventurous, curious, fearless, dreamy, loving, but like every kid, just getting into danger by their desire to become king soon, and do not listen to the advice of elders. But above all, he loves his parents. When Simba grows, Matthew Broderick is who dubs the character, managing to convey a lack of confidence and existential doubt that the character felt in much of the film. Robert Guillaume is another that stands voicing the wise Rafiki. Even just appearing on the scene, notice the careful composition of the character, where the actor has a voice that comes to intelligence, life experience and mysticism fundamental to the character. Rafiki is essential to teach Simba to deal with the pain, death and guilt, and thus overcome them. Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings dub the three hyenas, Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. Despite being allies of the villain, hyenas can be threatening when put in correctly closes the directors, but also pluck laughter in the audience through his own laughter, especially Jim Cummings as EdBut the highlights are even worshiped boar meerkat Timon and Pumba. The duo was so successful that the characters have earned their own series produced between 1995 and 1999. Nathan Lanee Ernie Sabella as Timon and Pumbaa respectively, are of fundamental importance to increase the air comic plot and being the great family support Simba during their growth phase. Timon is remarkable for its high ironic, selfish, fragile, while Pumbaa is strong, has a deep voice and imposing and yet is naiver than Timon. The reversal of character between the two that constrastam with their physical is what most pleases. The pair of friends teaches Simba to live through Hakuna Matata (no problem) and are the protagonists of the funniest scenes of the projection, and it is implied that the overcoming of the problems is only possible when we have friends who support us.Few people know that The Lion King was one of the pioneers in introducing the use of CG in their scenes. The photograph used with intelligence knows lighting, giving bright scenes during the day a cheerful and harmonious shared by all. But when we witness the scenes that take place in the Cemetery of the Elephants, the scenes are more bleak, cold, dark and depict well the danger that those who dare to enter the site submit. This play of light is efficiently used all the time. We can repair all the time that Mufasa and the other characters of the good are always bright and impressive. It is clear the importance given to the nature and animals, implying that large from ants to elephants are vital and equal to the life cycle of endless work and stay in constant balance. Scar already on the other hand, as hyenas, is always in shadow. The timing of this is clearer when Scar, taking advantage of the innocence of his nephew and hungry hyenas and ignorant to achieve its goal of assuming the throne, reigns with tyranny emerging in his kingdom of darkness new times. We note the kingdom with a less grandiose landscape, darker, melancholic, even where the lionesses do have to go hunting in search of scarce food. Still, Scar is unable to recover the devastation that his government has caused to the ecosystem, denoting a mood of unhappiness and tyranny, contrasting totally with the times of the reign fair, balanced and harmonious with the nature of Mufasa.Another significant moment in the use of colors and lighting is the meeting Simba and Nala, where we can see a color that reflects the love between the two, even after years without seeing each other. Incidentally, it is interesting to climate change in a few minutes in this sequence. After this most romantic moment involving music, we have a brief discussion between Simba and Nala, and he soon after walking through a long and winding path that we all must pass to find our true destiny. This track is represented full of twigs and night lighting has to expand this idea of being lost until the moment we find our personal responses, the end of this track, with the help of Rafiki and the image of his father, he finally finds his place in the world and seeking to resume his leadership of the kingdom.As mentioned briefly before, the soundtrack is another outstanding feature. The German master Hans Zimmer (Days of Thunder (1990), Thelma & Louise (1991), True Romance (1993)) consists here perhaps his first major commercial success of many others that would. The instrumental track known to be lively and dramatic moments in the prone, involving the viewer in an impressive way. The integration of the track to what we see happening is magic. A beautiful instrumental music is 'Under the Stars'. Zimmer manages to be light and happy all the time. But when Scar appears on the scene we can see a trail darker accompanying color changes and shadows in scenes. Already on track sung, we also adding musicians like Elton John and Tim Rice as important contributors. Among the tracks are: 'Circle of Life', 'I Just Can not Wait to be King', 'Be Prepared', 'Hakuna Matata', 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight?'. They are all beautiful songs and working with the narrative, often telling the feelings of the characters at any given time. Oscar in 1995, the five songs that competed in the category for best song, three were of the Disney movie 'Circle of Life', 'Hakuna Matata' and the big winner, 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight'. The same categories were also winners in Oscar winning at the Golden Globes in the same year. And Hans Zimmer won best soundtrack, as was to be expected.The Lion King is the legitimate representative of the Golden Age of Disney, full of endearing characters, with traditional and efficient lessons of life, ethics and morals of the company, with a history well based, fun and exciting, it values ties family, respect for hierarchy, and respectful and harmonious coexistence among the different beings. A big show of animation that marked a generation. Viva the Great King of the Jungle and Hakuna Matata!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
One of my favorite animated films ever,"""The Lion King"" has been such an important part of so many childhoods since it came out, but what is so remarkable is that, whereas some childhood entertainment loses a lot of luster once the nostalgia- goggles come off, I find my appreciation for this film to grow the older I get. I personally don't believe Disney has yet created a more beautiful film, since it isn't just a detailed rendition of African wildlife, but its such a deliriously colorful and expressively animated film to boot. The story is honest in its portrayal of the corruption that exists in the world, but more importantly, in the hope that good moral judgement can overcome such corruption. The voice cast is pitch- perfect, the soundtrack remains the absolute greatest in animated film history, and the script (while perhaps not wholly original) deftly balances searing emotional truths with charmingly silly antics.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

It's a film I've introduced all of my nieces and nephews too, and one day I'll introduce my own kids to this too. The circle of life story is so key for us all. There will always be hard moments and evil people we have to deal with, but we can overcome it with some help from some good and true people in our lives. That moment in the end when Simba finally walks up the rock to rightfully claim his place as king and roars, always gets me; they manage to capture how tough the struggle is and even with the look of awe from his friends and family in that moment, I just love it and I love this film. I always think kid stories should teach people about good and evil and the Lion King does this brilliantly. In that way its a kids and adult story all in one, and as a young adult, I still think it's brilliant! I can't recall how many times I've watched the play in London and NYC, and have taken friends and family to see this too. This will always be a classic.

Another stereotype,"I first saw this movie when I was 10 and cried when Mustafa died. I loved it. However, I watch it as an adult and see some sad stuff. Disney has sought to create movies about various cultures. That's admirable, however, in this particular film about Africa, everyone is an animal. This links to the stereotype of Black beastiality. Also, the voices have only 2 black actors behind them and there's an English voice for Scar. Are they saying that Blacks can't even play themselves? This movie could have worked just as well with humans in Africa. Why wasn't that an option? Whites have all their numerous films, Native Americans got Pochahontas, People of Mideastern descent got Aladdin, Asians got Mulan, blacks get The Lion King. I see something quite wrong with that. I know that it's a beloved movie, but also think about what it's saying to little kids about Africa.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Too dark for kids,"I know that this movie is absolutely atmospheric and the image detail and score are wonderful (hence the 3 stars) but as a Disney animation for the family, it is NOT appropriate for kids 6 years and under.

My daughters couldn't even finish the movie, I had to turn it off before half way.However, for +10 year olds it is fine.

It doesn't glorify fooling around as one of my colleagues told me. The free life is OK but at some time you must follow your heart and redeem yourself.

The perfect film to make you happy when you're upset! :),"Previously when I'd watched this, I liked it, but I preferred many other Disney films. Re- watching this film cheered me up when I was sad right then and there!For those of you who don't know, this is the story of a lion cub called Simba who's future king. He lives on Pride Rock with his loving parents and his friend Nala, a girl lion cub. When he goes into a place he was told not to go, it is only the start of a mesmerising and exciting adventure...I love this film for the five main reasons. Reason 1: I like all the characters in this except Scar, the main baddie. He annoys me just slightly (although I like his voice). Reason 2: The scenery portrays a beautiful vision of Africa and it makes me feel like I'm really there. Reason 3: The plot is very beautiful and it has made me want to read ""Hamlet"" on which the plot was based! Reason 4: This film has beautiful songs! My favourite is ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight?"" (written by Elton John) but I love all the others as well. Reason 5: I love the voices that were picked for all the characters. I especially like the sound of Jeremy Iron's (Scar), Rowan Atkinson's (Zazu), Nathan Lane's (Timon), Whoopi Goldberg's (Shenzi), James Earl Jones's (Mufasa) and Moira Kelly's (adult Nala) voices!WARNING! For those of you who are upset by goodies dying in films, then I suggest you use the fast forward button on your remote control when Mufasa leaps up on a rock ledge in the stampede until you see Scar walking towards Simba and Mufasa.Otherwise, enjoy one of my favourite classic Disneys! :) ;) :()",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

It's the circle of cash... and it moves us all... out to the theaters...,"If only it could move us inside...Let's be honest, Disney has never been a non profit-making organization and Uncle Walt was a man of vision AND economical flair. Still, before turning into a voracious corporate blob, Disney was still the quintessential dream factory and nostalgia builder for many, many, many generations. And even for these direct-to-video sequels that spread all over the 2000s like a bad cold, some brain cells of imaginations were mobilized.But now Disney's not even trying to pretend, investing all the efforts on a pure technical level and the kind of marketing-that-speaks-for-itself. It is one thing to adapt fairy tales into live-actions, before ""Cinderella"", there was ""Enchanted"", ""Maleficent"" or even Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"". And yet Disney executives found the trick: it's not about adapting the fairy tale but the Disney version of it. Thorns are still invisible over the head with the two round ears but right now in 2022, it seems that ""awakening your inner child"" isn't a motto anymore but a formula.The formula could have interesting results: the 2016 ""Jungle Book"" film could center on little Mowgli and diverged from the 1967 film. Same with ""Dumbo"" or ""Aladdin"". But exclusively animal-centered movies like ""The Lion King"", ""Bambi"" or ""The Lady and the Tramp"" are a different challenge. You've got to humanize the way animals could act, react or display emotions. Take the kiss between Lady and the Tramp, the magic is not within the moment their mouths meet but the cute and genuine embarrassment that follows. You can't ""animate"" these emotions with live-action animals with all the technology of the world.Indeed if your purpose is that your lion looks real, you can't expand the range of facial expressions: remember in ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" the way Pongo and Perdita looked at each other at the end of the garden scene: reproducing that with real-looking animals is inconceivable, couldn't work, wouldn't work. And that's the ultimate wager of photorealistic remakes: achieve documentary-like realism with storylines that were designed for hand-drawn or at the very least CGI animation, ""Toy Story"" CGI I mean.And that leads to even more perplexing results when it comes to 'surreal' sequences like ""I Just Can't Wait to Be The King"" where two normal-looking cubs are casually running across pink flamingoes, or the moment that precedes Simba's epiphany where the figure of Mufasa is barely visible in the sky (not to mention that some lines were cut from the original). Now, maybe Disney takes for granted our passion for the ""Lion King"" and considers that we're there to ""fill the gaps"". It's true I did enjoy the film to the degree that it reminded of ""The Lion King"", which is a high point of my childhood, but at the end of the day, my mind was full of afterthoughts. To put it simple, I realized it was an enjoyment by proxy.The problem of ""The Lion King"" isn't that it's good or bad. It is certainly a remarkable achievement on the field of animation. The problem is that it is problematic. Yes I'm talking in circles but that's a circle Disney has just taken us into and that makes it rather impossible to figure what is wrong with these photorealistic films, we know there's something that doesn't look right, maybe on a pure reason-to-be way.""The Lion King"" is one of the classics of animation, a masterpiece that speaks highhy of the dedication of old-school Disney team of animators. 1995 would change the games with the first CGI and so in a way, ""The Lion King"" was the culmination of that traditional hand-drawn art. Not only that but its story, very simple and straightforward carried the gravitas and dramas or movie classics. Characters like Scar, Mufasa, Simba are all printed in our memories, the songs became pop culture monuments, scenes have been parodied countless times. ""The Lion King"" became a household name for Disney excellence. And certainly one of the greatest opening sequences of history, the shivers down your spine sent by the sight of Rafiki carrying little Simba is one of these moments you can't just 'duplicate'.As viewers pointed out, many things are missing: where is the friendly nod Mufasa gives Zazu? Or that hug between Rafiki and Mufasa? Mufasa comes across as a stone-faced patriarch posing like a library statue... and waiting for our nostalgic pheromones to instill some life in him .... Maybe we were just curious to see how they'd pull this out. I guess if I was told about an animated version of ""The Godfather"" no matter how ludricrous it sounds I would have given a shot. ""The Lion King"" was such a big deal, viewers did came to see and made it one of the highest grossing films of the year.Fair enough, but what's that does say exactly? That half the job was done and make a copy of something great to make something of equally promising greatness? The purpose of a remake is to bring something new. But ""The Lion King 2019"" doesn't bring anything new except for the realistic animation that doesn't look like an improvement anyway.. Scar looks like a washed out lion who shampooed his mane with paint thinner, without one tenth the suave charisma of the original. James Earl Jones' voice looks like he was only testing the microphone or was bored to death, which actually matched the look of the used-to-be majestic lion.And I swear the savannah and jungle never looked so dismal with tones of beige and yellowish green that reminded me of that Water Truce sequence in ""The Jungle Book"". So much for the bright colors and the escapism.... And the only thing visible right now are the thorns on the head, and the round ears have turned pointy... no it's not the devil, but a cow, a cash-cow.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
The Lion King,Well...the visual effects are groundbreaking but it lacks heart and flare - and feels soulless compared to the original.

Falls Short,"I just got out of the Lion KingAnd I have to say it falls short of delivering for me. Elements of this new version are spectacular because of the quality of animation... But so much else was just mediocre... Starting with the poor voice talent. My favorite animated movies are brought to life by memorable distinctive voices... I loved what Burt Reynolds brought to All Dogs Go To Heaven, then Robin Williams set the bar with Aladdin, then we have Tom Hanks, Billy Crystal, Mike Myers, then Eddie Murphy... The list is long but those films wouldn't have been the same without those voices. This new Lion King film has none of that... it's all just so flat.About 80% of this, is shot for shot/word for word the same as the 1994 classic. Although there is a subplot involving Scar and Sarabi from the Broadway show inserted.My next issue was the soundtrack... Again, there is nothing special here. The 1994 soundtrack was one of the all-time best. I hated Beyoncé singing Can You Feel The Love Tonight. I am not a fan of hers anyway, and her appeal is totally lost on me, but I can acknowledge when she is good as in Goldmember.Finally, and my biggest issue... The realistic non-expressions of the animals. Because you can't see happy or sad in their faces, you fully depend on the mediocre delivery of dialog. This was very distracting. The lion's faces do not show sad... happy... scared. This was like watching a two hour voice over.I found it less entertaining and engrossing than Aladdin and Dumbo, although at times I did enjoy this movie. I can safely say I will never watch it again, and will stick with my 1994 classic, So for me, this was just a mediocre unnecessary remake while showcasing perhaps the greatBest animation ever.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Doesn't roar enough,"1994's 'The Lion King' is not just one of my favourite Disney films, it is also one of my favourite animated films and one of my favourites overall. Beautiful animation, some of Disney's most iconic songs and amazing score, an entertaining and powerful story with unforgettable moments, terrific voices (especially James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons) and joint best beginning to a Disney film alongside 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'.Disney's live action films are often frowned upon, they often have been described as pointless and many feel that Disney are running out of ideas. Can totally understand this, as the small handful that have been made so far have not really been necessary but the quality of them have varied. 'Cinderella' and 'The Jungle Book' were great and by far the best of the remakes, but the rest have left me mixed. Will admit to not really seeing the point of this version and was not massively impressed by the trailer, but saw it anyway being such a fan of Disney and because my sister desperately wanted to see it. Watching it way back when it first came out but with being behind with my reviewing it took me to now to review it, it was a little better than expected and not as bad as others have said. My sister did like it a lot better than me, with my feelings being quite lukewarm. Am really trying not to compare and try and judge it on its own terms, but sometimes it is hard when the quality of a remake, follow up or another adaptation is very far removed from something so good and that is the case with comparing both 'The Lion King' films.'The Lion King' (2019) does have good things. The best thing about it by a mile is the visuals, which are absolutely fantastic. Something of a technical achievement, with the scenery being breathtaking in every sense (""Circle of Life"" being a notable example) and the characters (excepting their eyes needing more expression) blend very realistically in a way where one gets the sense that this was a nature documentary. The score is still powerful, especially in the stampede and one of Disnney's most iconic tear-jerkers. Have always loved the songs, and with two exceptions they still make an impact. ""Circle of Life"" is truly awe-inspiring and the closest the film came to making me cry.Most of the dialogue has some moments of humour (Timon and Pumbaa) and tension (the hyenas). The story has its moments. Can not praise ""Circle of Life"" enough, Timon and Pumbaa are amusing and the stampede is intense, not goosebump-inducing though, even though everybody who has seen the original will know the outcome. Making the hyenas scarier and fleshing out the lionesses (a little) more were good moves. Actually thought that a lot of the voice work was not bad at all, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan being so much fun and by far the best faring of the voices, they were clearly having fun too with the improvising and their comic timing is full of exuberance not obvious elsewhere. Florence Kasumba's Shenzai is very different, the opposite in fact, to Whoopi Goldberg's, and the more sinister edge worked very well. James Earl Jones, the only voice actor to reprise his role, still has Mufasa's booming dignity and Donald Glover does quite well.Didn't care for some however. Was mixed on John Oliver, who is fun but overdoes it at times. Beyonce comes over as very out of place, her voice not fitting how Nala looks, and she even sounded bored. Chiwetel Eijofor, a good actor who was brilliant in '12 Years a Slave', was the biggest disappointment, found him too subdued for Scar and he is nowhere near as menacing or enjoys himself as much as Irons (whose voice work is some of the best for any Disney, and animated, film). While ""Circle of Life"", ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" and ""Hakuna Matata"" come off well (especially ""Circle of Life""), ""Be Prepared"" was bizarre and quite over the top, what a way to waste one of the greatest Disney villain songs. ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" was reminiscent of decent at best karaoke. ""Spirit"" is even worse, that did not fit within the film and was more an excuse for Beyonce to show off her vocal chops and have actually heard much better singing from her.Excepting the hyenas being scarier, some additional dialogue and the lionesses being more fleshed out, 'The Lion King' suffers from being too faithful and not having enough of its own identity. Too many of the scenes are near-carbon copies with only fleeting moments of heart and soul, mostly the film emotionally is very bland. The big death scene, heart-wrenching before, is treated in too throwaway a fashion. The additional dialogue and any interpolations are not for the better either and actually rather jar, while the cuts and changes were not necessary. The eyes and facial expressions for the characters, especially Scar, lack nuance and are at times borderline creepy.Summing up, found a lot to like but was disappointed overall. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"If Anything, It's a Monumental Technical Achievement","As nature documentaries go, the modern remake of The Lion King (2019) gives some of the best a run for their money, quite literally. With a $250 million price tag, it achieves digitally what David Attenborough has spent his life capturing on camera. The result is jaw-droppingly photorealistic, but it also makes for a strange first impression. Imagine watching a Disneynature feature but with actors reading The Lion King screenplay over the top of it and the effect would be eerily similar. It takes time to accept lifelike looking animals talking like cartoon characters, but the ground-breaking technical skill in which they are brought to life makes the bumpy journey worthwhile.Every tress of fur, crack in the arid soil and sun-swept vista is rendered in such immense detail that it's unsurprising that many people are calling this reboot live-action. It's a monumental technical achievement and the level of visual fidelity on display alone warrants seeing this film on the biggest screen possible.However, in terms of the story, the film follows the original so closely that it can't help but feel second rate. Scene-by-scene, it dutifully ticks off the story beats of the 1994 original, with little by way of surprises in-between. It also doesn't help that film's photo-realism unavoidably limits the ability of the animals to convey emotion without looking unnatural or (naturally) cartoonish, and the result is a film that often creates indifference where there should be wonder. With jaw-dropping visuals, plenty of humour and solid renditions of timeless songs, it's hard to see this modern remake failing but, as it turns out, The Lion King's (2019) biggest achievement also ends up being its biggest flaw.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"For looking so true-to-life, most of this film is lifeless","This remake manages to suck all the life out of the original. It really is like watching National Geographic while hearing The Lion King (1994) on in the other room. There is a total disconnect between what you are seeing on-screen and what you are hearing or supposed to feel-so much that I am surprised this was not noticed early on and left on the cutting room floor. Baloo in Favreau's The Jungle Book (2016) alone should have been a warning sign.At its best, the soundtrack is only as good as the original. I was waiting out for Beyoncé and Donald Glover hoping maybe they would save it with charm, humor, or chemistry, but Beyoncé oversings/overacts and Glover's few moments just aren't enough. John Oliver does steal his scenes as Zazu and I'm a fan of Scar's character design. Visual effects are extremely well done, but for a production that looks so true-to-life, most of the film is lifeless.Very disappointed.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Live Action? No. Beautifully animated? Abso-freaking-lutely!,"The Lion King (2019) is another one of those Disney remakes that mooches off the success of a classic to bring in bank for Mr. Mouse. Now, if you look past ALL OF THAT, The Lion King is able to stand really well on it own. For a remake, it's good. Not too far from the original story, songs are all mostly the same, Timon and Pumbaa have good chemistry most of the time, etc, etc, yada yada yada. I'll admit, the movie does have its weaknesses. It does get slow and the writing is ehh at times. The animals are VERY realistic, meaning it's hard to display emotion in these animals. So a scene like mufasa's death no longer has the heart that was found in the original movie. In a nutshell, this movie is, from an animation standpoint, ""we draw better now"". I do view the movie as a bit of guilty pleasure, considering it's not so liked by audiences. If you want to watch a good movie for what it is, ignoring the original for at least 2 hours, then you will have a good time. If you can let the original go for all that is Holy, then this movie is not for you, keep away from it if you don't want to see your classic tarnished.

Unnecessary Remake,"In Africa, the lion cub Simba is the pride and joy of his parents King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi. Mufasa prepares Simba to be the next king of the jungle. However, the naive Simba believes in his envious uncle Scar that wants to kill Mufasa and Simba to become the next king. He lures Simba and his friend Nala to go to a forbidden place and they are attacked by hyenas but they are rescued by Mufasa. Then Scar plots another scheme to kill Mufasa and Simba but the cub escapes alive and leaves the kingdom believing he was responsible for the death of his father. Now Scar becomes the king supported by the evil hyenas while Simba grows in a distant land. Sometime later, Nala meets Simba and tells that the kingdom has become a creepy wasteland. What will Simba do?""The Lion King"" is an unnecessary remake of the 1994 animated film. The songs are boring and the nice images tell a story without soul.

Just Watch the Original,"1. This is obviously not live action, it's animation, stop saying it's live action. DO YOU SEE REAL LIONS??2. None of the animals have any expression. This is supposed to be a dramatic musical based on Hamlet, and they populated an emotionally driven story with expressionless characters.3. The music has been changed for the worse. Musical stings are edited in at the wrong moments. The music is poorly mixed. ""Be Prepared"" was completely neutered. Beyonce's three chord song doesn't sound remotely African and doesn't fit with the rest of the music.4. There are good actors cast in this movie, and some non-actors, but neither groups seems to have been directed as to how to voice an animated character, or how to take on the aspects of the animal they were portraying. Compared to Eartha Kitt as Catwoman or even the performances from the 1994 movie, the delivery is very flat and uninspired.5. James Earl Jones is a great actor, but casting him in his old age and deteriorating physical condition, expecting him to somehow match or exceed his performance from 25 years ago doesn't make sense, especially when every other role was recast. He just doesn't sound good. They could have paid him the same and reused his recordings from the original and it would have been better.6. The changes made to the story don't seem to have a point, they're not motivated by emotion or the characters.7. 2 stars for all the animators who actually tried to make a good movie.8.

Compromised,"When you take one of the greatest stories to grace the silver screen and then combine it with exceptional visual effects, you'd expect the end product to be a wonderful contemporary refresh, ready to captivate young hearts and minds all over again. However, in the process of trying to out a slightly new spin on the Lion King, they've tampered with some elements that have detracted from the value of the film.So many reboots of classic films have fallen victim to the same adaption of storyline's to try and appease more contemporary audiences, but almost always end up being worse. The Lion King doesn't deviate from the original script and story as much as some other modern remakes, but it does still mix it up. Some of the changes arguably a small improvement, but some are significantly worse. The original film has so many subtle lessons, but sadly some of the best ones have been altered or removed entirely in this new version.Overall, the story is still close enough to the original to be decent, and the visual effects are quite remarkable. Although, the animals' faces appear somewhat dull, as the hyper realism doesn't allow for the same range of expression as the original cartoon.Overall, it's not a bad interpretation of the original, but a far cry from stellar heights of its predecessor.

STOP PAYING DISNEY TO LAZILY REMAKE YOUR CHILDHOOD,"My question going into the latest ""pay-us-for-your-nostalgia"" Disney-remake was, ""Why do we need this? What new can it bring?"". Technically, the CGI animation is impressively state-of-the-art and new. Otherwise, my worst fears were warranted. It's not just similar to its source material but is 100% the same in almost every aspect. From moment one, when the iconic ""NAAAH SA-VIN-YAAAH!"" bursts forth, I realized they were so beholden to the '94 classic they didn't even bother rerecording that vocal. It sets the stage for both the larger things (story beats / scenes), as well as the smaller things (specific line deliveries), to be a lazy karaoke tune. So frustratingly unimaginative, it makes 2019's Aladdin look like a feat of original storytelling.
Thankfully, the greatness of the story is left untouched, though it was already plenty great without being redone. The few things that are changed don't expand the story, but just extend scenes past the point of reasonable story economics. We're forced to sit through self-congratulatory animation montages that are useless beyond ""look what we did!""
Crowds seem to be going for the cast, and many of those performances are the highlights. Listening to Glover & Beyonce sing together is special, Scar is decently rendered, and Rogen & Eichner offer the most unique and successful moments. Still, with dialogue so slavish, you can sense the actors desperately trying not to copy what they grew up hearing.
Honestly, even the technical brilliance is often a hindrance. By making the animals photoreal, we take away individual personalities, physical nuances, and even facial expressions, all of which help us relate to their plight.

To get a little more involved with few of the characters, just to see them more, because it felt like they were passing by just to show things a few times, otherwise they were so great in conveying emotion, movement, often.With all this said, I also hope they still will do more ""real"" cartoons in the old style, the aim shouldn't be to always just make it advanced in tech, but also I don't think this movie suffers from it.

And That song has never been my favorite... but the new one is just so much worse. Very cringey..So now for the best part. The CGI. I have NEVER seen anything like it. Just ridiculously gorgeous, I couldn't believe how much work went into this. I had to stop the movie in the beginning to google if I was watching an actual live action movie with CGI over it. Nope, totally CGI. Incredible. That right there makes it worth the watch.This movie is a one-time watch for me. I would say it's worth it if you've got nothing else going on and you wanted to experience it for the beautiful CGI and indulge in a little nostalgia.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Yes, the animated will always be the original, but if we are honest, this is a new era, updating the movies is a must for future generations, no matter if you like the fact that classic animation is dying.

Well done remake but feels second rate.,"While the movie was done well and it looked great, it did at times look a bit computery. Also it really lacked the heart and emotion that the original had in my opinion and I'm only 26.

Simba was so freakin cute though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Shockingly realistic visual effects take away from emotional expressivity,"For only rating this movie as a 7/10, I sure feel like I have a lot to say about it. The vision of the film was clearly to make the most realistic version of the classic tale as possible, and it succeeded spectacularly in that way. The wildlife and natural scenery were bar none in the world of CGI grounded in realism. This also happens to be its greatest downfall, however. By creating ultra-realistic lions, they sacrifice a huge part of what made the original lion king so special: emotional expressivity in the faces of the animals. So now we have reached an interesting point in our movie-tech, where we can create animation that looks worse but portrays human emotion well, or we can make things hyper-realistic. I look forward to the day we can have both. The voice acting cast was phenomenal. Specifically, John Oliver, Donald Glover, and Seth Rogan came out to play. Beyonce and Glover were interesting to hear sing together, with Glover holding down the lower, constant melodies, and Beyonce controlling the song. There were times that it felt Beyonce was going a bit too far and the character no longer felt like Nala, but rather, Beyonce.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Simba has grown up. :D,"I think it sure must be a lot of brain work to imagine how the real scenes in Afrika will match with the animations. Jon Favreau, which I do admire for his works, did a real good and visionary job, and so did the camera department and the animators. I really liked the little changes that show a more developed story than the full animated original. I would give it the full 10/10, if there would have been a better dub in Germany, because not all of the voices did fit. Scar's voice was way too soft. But that's not the only voice. When it came to the sequence with Timon and Pumbaa, it really got very strong and had funny moments, I didn't expect. If Walt Disney could see it, he would be delighted. For most of his 22 (!) Oscars he was awarded for animal documentations. This movie unites both worlds of cinema - fictional animated and dramatized story with landscape documentations. I like how the animals look and specially how they move! The story is all in all the same.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

"A more mature, darker take on the original.","I have always been a massive fan of the original Lion King, but I went into this not expecting a scene for scene remake. The live action is more mature, it's darker, it fleshes out parts the original skipped over, and gave significance to the insignificant.
I've seen a lot of people complain about the lack of emotion, and while I agree there was less emotion to facial expressions, there was a lot more emotion in the character's actions, their minor movements, and the way they held themselves. I am personally glad they didn't go too cartoonish with the facial expressions, as it would've taken away from the realism.
I recommend going in with an open mind, and the understanding that this is more mature than its animated predecessor.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Overrated and way too much spotlight on beyonce,"Lion King was the only movie growing up that actually made me cry, the soundtrack alone was amazing, but there was a magic in the cartoon version. This new one is awful. They spent tons of money on the tech and actors, but forgot to add the magic. This isn't the Lion Queen, it's not about beyonce, but it's become all about her, when she didnt actually bring anything to the movie. James Earl Jones will never get a bad review in my book, he did his job. Everyone else was simply forgettable. The cartoon version I remember each actor, each song, each joke, etc and I havent watched it in years. My guess is that Disney is making all these worthless remakes to maintain the copyrights of those movies, but there's 0 intention to do it with the same magic and formula that captivated people from the beginning. The only remake I've enjoyed so far is Cinderella, we even bought it. The rest I don't even remember and my kids prefer the cartoon versions over the remakes now too, that should say something. Not that anyone at Disney will care, their goal is to take over everything to continue being in control and taking in heaps of money for their own exploits. I'll stick with the original Lion King, including the soundtrack and the Broadway show (also amazing), and never speak of this waste of money of a film again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Garbage,"I did not want to see this movie. I did not want the Mouse to think that I in any way support this new trend of simply remaking old Disney classics with wooden actors and sparkling CGI. But alas, I was dragged into the movie theatre anyway, and here I am, telling you that I'm deeply ashamed that the Great Black Mouse of Disney has my money. Yet again.Because I was right in not wanting to see this film. Because this is the bottom of the barrel. The other movies have kind of been shot for shot remakes, but every single one of them has had at least something new. Some other angle, some twist, to make it interesting. This, one the other hand? Holy cow in heaven, is this bad. The beginning, for example. You know, The Circle of Life, one of the most recognizable and striking movie openings in history. The exact same. Shot for shot, camera angle for camera angle, the exact same. Except, you know, not as colourful, iconic or fetching. Because it's supposed to look real. Which in this case apparently means that everything looks either more wrinkled, dusty and/or dirty in general. Because that's Serengeti for you. According to the film makers.Luckily they stopped with the exact shot for shot soon after that, thank heavens, but that was only a minor relief. Because you know what else happens, when you try to make everything look as real as possible? Aside from everything looking like it's going to give you fleas. It makes everything look emotionless! Lions are not exceptionally renowned for their wide range of facial expressions, you know. The reason you can make animated movies with animals as the main characters is because animation doesn't care that lions can't have facial expressions. You can go outside the realms of biology and what's strictly speaking possible. You can exaggerate, emote and play loose with the rules. You can use colours, shapes and perspectives to compensate, to make it look interesting. This film has none of that! It's a dull, emotionless, flat table reading of dialogues we all know and love, but which are given nothing to support them.Not helping the matter is the fact that they hired celebrity voice actors. These people are talented entertainers, yes, and they look fetching on a poster, but none of them is exactly renowned for their voice acting capabilities. And boy does that show! Even James Earl Jones sounds like he's about to keel over and pass beyond the veil at any moment. There's very little of the majesty and gravitas of the original Mufasa left in his performance.And I actually misspoke earlier. This thing has one new thing in it. A song. A song by Beyonce, named Spirit. Because apparently that was the price of getting her on board. Or perhaps Disney wants an Original Song Oscar nomination. I don't know, but the song is awful and feels exactly like what it is. A forced, jammed in last-minute addition.Saints in heaven, was this a bad movie. It's a bit over a week after I saw it, but writing this review actively ruined my morning. I feel awful even thinking about this. About the fact that Disney has made incredible amounts of money with this. That they're going to keep making these.And I contributed to it. I think I might be sick.

Bad artistic choice and lure of profit ?,"It is now obvious that The Lion King story doesn't suit the Live Action movie format.
Because of its realism, the movie loses the expressivity, fantasy and humor of the original one. The songs have been shorten and some dialogues have been rewritten, only not for the better.
At least, the movie could have been smarter. It is in certain points, some incoherences have been fixed but not all, but in general the ideas lack of developments.
Jon Favreau may not have been the better choice because he is not really good at filming landscapes (I already saw it in The Jungle Book). James Cameron (Avatar) and Ang Lee (Life of Pi) would have done a better job.I had shed a tear or two in some key scenes, but it was very modestly made.

It just lacks emotion,"That's right, the movie lacks emotion. In the original you could see the love that was put into the entire thing, but this one? It clearly was all for the money. I knew that since the moment I saw the trailer, but whatever.
Animation: The sad thing is that, the major flaw in the fact that everything is CGI. The moviments and expressions of the characters are limited due to the realism they're trying to portrait. The original cartoon-ish style permitted the characters to have expressive moviments and expressions, but here, that's just not possible. I feel like they tried to exaggerate some of the characters moviments, but that turned out to give me some uncanny valley vibes. It would be better to make their faces more expressive and sacrifice part of the realism, really. That would feel way better.
And the colors? Oh, they're very realistic! That means boring. They could've played more with those to make the movie feel more alive.

The Lion's Share of Nostalgia,"The Lion King is great - that is a fact. The original animated film is Disney gold, and this film captures that, for the most part, incredibly well. But...so often, the film is just a carbon copy of the original, scene for scene, with the same soundtrack, songs, cinematography and moments. True, there are some additional scenes added in, and some changes do occur, don't get me wrong, and occasionally, John Oliver as Zazu and Seth Rogen as Pumbaa insert some alternate, and very funny lines, but the film is, at its core, so close to being a mirror image to the original, that it's surreal. I will admit, the special effects are utterly perfect, and truly breathtaking to watch. It is impossible to tell this utterly perfect work of art apart from reality. That aside, it is still just a copy. Who has seen The Poseidon Adventure? Who saw The New Poseidon Adventure? Who saw Poseidon? All different - similar story, but each offer their own unique take on the narrative. Who saw Godzilla 1954? Who saw the 1997 American remake? (God help me, I'm actually using this film to make a point). Who saw Godzilla 2014? Each of these films bring something new to the properties, with each project being vastly different. The Lion King however, is thoroughly predictable.Some people will argue that is a good thing, and I understand that. Those I saw the movie with this evening said it reminded them of their childhood; their old friends, and what they used to do. It was incredibly nostalgic and melancholic for them, and I can't deny that I occasionally felt chills just watching it (in a good way, mind you). Donald Glover and Beyoncé absolutely knock it out of the park with their rendition of the tunes, and their voice acting of the central protagonists was really on the mark (though Beyoncé deserved significantly more opportunities because, you could just tell, she was loving the role). Florence Kasumba as hyena leader, Shenzi, was a definite stand out; she brought an undeniable sinisterness to the role that was absent from the animated feature, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar was just sublime. Ejiofor's voice alone gave amazing presence to the film, capturing Scar's cunning ruthlessness, making him just as appealing an antagonist as ever. As for James Earl Jones as Mufasa, what can I say? I could listen to that man's voice all day long - he still managed to offer some changes in the way he performed his lines in contrast with the original, despite there again, being vast similarities, and it was brilliant to listen to him give the grand king life once more.The changes to the elephant graveyard scene were especially brilliant, and the many new faces added to the habitat that Timon and Pumbaa inhabit were cute, cuddly and added more character to the environment, making it feel more lived in. One massive change from the film however, is the significant lack of any physical emotions. Though the actors deserve kudos for the emotive performances they provide, the faces of the animated characters presenting these lines, remind stoic at best, even in the most emotive moments. Don't get me wrong, this feature still has some emotively powerful occasions, though some of the animated films most tragic moments did not affect me as dearly in this adaptation, whereas others had an even more profound affect.At the end of the day, I would recommend this movie, however, so much that it does right, is just lifted from the original. As a teacher, I often tell my students that copying is a bad thing - having your own spin on it, and adding your own personality to something, to make it your own, is what makes it great, and I just wish that director, Jon Favreau, would have taken the opportunity to do something more with this beloved classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Terrible acting!! Doesn't compare to the original,"I LOVE the original. I wanted to love this movie. I was over the moon excited for it. They took out too many important parts of the original. Showing the strength of Mufasa but also his friendly side (his friendship with Zazu, how he respects and hugs Rafiki, that he taught Simba how to pounce). Even the opening scene wasn't the same. Why would you alter that? The huge rising sun in tune with the music that gives almost everyone goosebumps. The new one you see trees with a slightly lit up morning sky and then a small sun appears off to the side that isn't in sync with the music. Mufasas personality doesn't sound the same even though it's still James Earl Jones' voice. It's different somehow. The hyenas are not the same. They don't make jokes and laugh at themselves like ""make mine a cub sandwich"" then laugh hysterically at their own jokes. They eliminated Ed, the one who doesn't speak, just laughs. Timon isn't flamboyant or half as funny as the original. The hula scene in the original was fast paced and funny to distract the hyenas. The new one he slowly sings ""Be our Guest""?? No action and not as fun. In fact, ALL of the new characters (including Beyoncé) sound like they are just reading from a script and it's really mundane and forced. None of them are in character and flow like the original. There's no sass or wit. The music is boring. It's a huge disappointment. Rafiki catches Simbas hair and knows immediately it's him. In the original, he knows the scent, but it takes him a minute to figure it out and when he does, he's ecstatic. Not in the remake. There is no image of Mufasa in the clouds to guide Simba to remember who he is. Rafiki doesn't give him a lesson about how the past can hurt with his stick. Simba doesn't hug Rafiki like his father did which is also symbolic to how Simba is like his father. I don't understand why Disney would eliminate these bonds and characters that we all love and change it to make what is a visually stunning movie into something I will never want to see again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

These Disney Remakes Are Getting Worse....,"After the torture of sitting through 2019 Aladdin as well as Dumbo, I actually at first refused to see this remake of The Lion King, mostly because the original is a near masterpiece, to many as well as myself, and watching it as a kid religiously, it seemed completely pointless remaking such a fantastic film that hasn't aged a day.However, as me and my fellow Cineworld card holders have cleared the cinema roster, The Lion King was the only thing on this weekend we hadn't seen. So I sucked it up and caved in and went with my mates. I wish I'd stayed at home.This is a hollow, bland, dull and completely vapid, shameless cash-grab from Disney. A visually beautiful yet dramatically and emotionally inept movie. The animals look photo real and that's an achievement, but without the expressive faces seen in the original, you can't buy into the drama and emotion. This is a shot for shot remake without the beauty, fun and heart of the 1994 classic.There's no magic, and that's what Disney prides itself on. The newly added scenes bring nothing but more length to this extremely slow remake. The colour, pop and brightness of the original are nowhere to be seen this time, instead we get a rather sepia looking film, any given David Attenborough documentary has more colour, style and emotion than this film.The cast are a mixed bag. Donald Glover couldn't be any more boring as older Simba, he sounds like he's either high or falling asleep. Beyonce brings some class to Nala but doesn't get a lot of screen time. Chjwetel Ejiofor who I normally love gave me a headache, and John Oliver is painful to listen to. Keegan-Michael Key feels like he's been stolen from another movie and dumped here and it doesn't work, though Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, surprisingly, did a good job.There's nothing remarkable about this film bar its visuals. It's just a cold, pointless remake that some will enjoy due to recognising certain shots which will trigger nostalgia. Even the kids in the cinema last night were wondering around bored, distracted and fidgeting, because the film has nothing to offer.

Visually amazing story Lazy,"The Lion King was one of if not my favourite film as a kid so I was always going to have this ""it will never be as good as the original"" but I enjoyed the Jungle Book and Mowgli so I knew the enjoyment factor could still be there. Visually it's stunning Disney look like they have spent an absolute fortune on this and it shows, but a few things with it there is no emotion being shown like 0 you can't tell if they're happy sad angry the only relation you have is with the voice, and that brings me to the sound. You can tell that the voice actors have done this in a studio from the first word spoken I was taken a back with how out of sync it was it just didn't fit. The whole film is almost shot scene for scene with the original which isn't that old at all. Scar's voice just wasn't menacing enough for me he was no Jeremy Irons I can tell you that, everything seemed rush, the scene when Mufasa gets thrown off the cliff by scar when he utters the word ""long live the king"" when Irons done it, it was slow, dark, scary like when the new actor does it, it's literally like they're having a normal conversation. I don't like the beyonce song the score was pretty much the same from the original. 6/10 is being generous from me, I would leave it for blu ray, I don't think the original is that old to justify a remake so soon and if you are going to do it change it up enough to make it worth while.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

I REALLY did keep an open mind...,"This is by far and away one of my top movies of all time and definitely a movie that I can say the lines pretty much the whole way through.After thinking about ""what I was disappointed with"", I would say the following:1. The broadway voices of Nathan lane, Ernie sambella and Jeremy irons really added that punch to the characters that you ""don't know that you're missing till it's gone"". Here I feel these characters fall flat with the ""less projecting voices"" and it was very noticeable. Seth Rogan was the best, but still, the missing ""broadway aspect"" these voices carried made the movie fall flat where it just could have been cast better???2. So many of the little humorous exchanges with the hyenas and with rafiki were taken away. Part of the magic of the lion king was in the humor which was lost in this film. They did try and compensate a little, but I feel the laughter was just not there. Whoopi goldberg and cheech Marin were comedians, why was this not explored more to bring new comedians in for the hyenas roles?Without the booming voices and humour, you realize that the movie is lacklustre where you are left with the story and the cinematography only. The cinematography is fantastic and I know this is a super hard movie to live up to the original, but I feel a lot of the magic that make this movie ""a whole package"" was just not there.Did not feel the same about Aladdin remake - another movie that was with huge shoes to fill (duh, robin williams) and the Aladdin remake was absolutely fantastic.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Movie is only good because it is a shot for shot remake of an already good film,"This is Lion King with nice HD graphics. There is maybe one or two new scenes that help flesh out the story, but if you have seen Lion King, you have seen Lion King (2019).The music is still pretty epic, but there is a very weird out of place pop song towards the final 20 minutes that just did not mesh well. Another issue is that ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" was performed in this movie during the daytime, so the lyrics made no sense at all. People already talked about the facial emotions of the animals and and angry lion, sad lion, or happy lion look the same. I would just prefer them to make it a little bit ""fantasy-like"" and just have these lions emote better with eyes or mouths.This movie kinda ruins some of the classic scenes, like the final battle was cool and a lot longer, but Simba and Scar's final showdown was better in the original. The remake didn't have the awesome slow motion slap that the original had.Lastly they ruined the most classic scene in the Lion King, the ""cloud"" scene. In the original you saw Mufasa's face in the cloud cleary, but in this remake all you see are clouds and lightning, with a very very brief glimpse of Mufasa. It kinda loss the emotional impact.Anyways it is a 6/10 because it is pretty much Lion King with god graphics.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Where do i begin...,"Where do i begin for this one.
First off, lets just start with casting. I'm not sure who was in charge of casting but wow you did an HORRIBLE job. Not only do the voice actors not know how to express emotion and make us FEEL something, the dialogue is all robotic! Seth Rogen (Pumba) was the only decent individual that matched his role and thats just because it's the easiest role to fill!Secondly, changing certain plot points didn't flow as smoothly, in other words, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" The hyenas were all of a sudden not comic relief or goofy, but instead more on political and serious. Timo and Pumba have a whole new group of friends in there jungle paradise, which isn't a big deal, but it makes it seem less like a special place that the three share.Thirdly, most of the movie is a visual flex, they focus less on story and more on trying to show you what their capable of with live action. There are scenes that will unnecessarily take longer than it should, just to be visually appealing.Finally, this movie did something so wrong, unlike the other Lion King. Instead of showing us emotion, they would consistently try to express it with dialogue. SHOW MORE, SAY LESS. You can say its because the other Lion King was animated and its easier to pull off, but i don't think so.Basically, been preaching this for a long time, PLEASE Disney, stop doing these remakes, you guys are ruining classics for the future generations.

Much ado about nothing,"This is an example of If ""it ain't broke, don't fix it."" The remake of a beloved classic fails to evoke the magic of Disney. It is staged, with exaggerated personification and anthropomorphism which is a deterrent rather than an asset to the film. The one redeeming quality is using Seth Rogen as the voice for Pumba. His performance brings about the only laughs in a very long and rather boring film.

Personally, with Beauty and the beast, Aladin, Jungle Book, Dumbo, etc there were always a few diversions from the original storyline, in example Aladin, Genie now has a love story, and female characters have been made stronger. Dumbo has added human factor and animals no longer talk etc. So there were times in while watching that I was thinking, OK it has been long time since I watched the cartoon, is this how it happened?Lion King however seems like it has been copied frame by frame, with exactly same music, lyrics, same fantastic landscape etc. (It may have been a few changes, but not noticeable) I feel like this film was made, just to make the film into live action. I don't know why they didn't just use the final sound production from the original animation and just worked on the visual part this time, there was no need to hire new voice actors, singers etc.There are many reviews targeting Disney's greed and ways to make money, agree, but it's the users who fall for it, no one is forcing kids to exclusively watch Disney movies.I enjoyed the film in cinema with my kids, I was probably their age when I watched the original, the original made life-time memories, the live action however, not for me...",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Most important scenes have been shortened, and useless scenes (cheaper ones my guess) have been lengthen (the mouse in the intro ? seriously ?). Yes, the goal is to put realism, but we could not tell the difference between lions (Sarabi and Nala in paritcular). Everything the original Lion King brought to us (essentially emotions, mostly from the animated faces) has been ripped off, event the few jokes by Timon and Pumbaa did not succeed to pass.Last but not least, the music seems off too. Some good scores are here, but at the end it just seems to be put above everything like ""eyh we need to put music"" ""ok just put it anywhere you want, dont forget suggestions to the previous score for nostalgia but dont care about if it fits"".This movie is an insult to an entire generation.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Think Before You Speak,I get why some people don't like the movie. Sure it's just the same story with different actors and enhanced visuals.

Walt Disney wanted his movies to be redone every 10 years so each generation would have a more updated version of these stories. You don't have to think this movie is amazing or anything.

"Enjoyable, but the bar is just too high","Let's start off by saying how great of a movie the original film is, deservedly deemed as one of the greatest Disney films ever and a classic that everyone should at least watch once in their life.
That being said, I watched this remake film trying not to have really high expectations and a mood to nit-pick every little detail. As is natural, when you try to remake a movie that is already well-established and barely-flawed, your task is very difficult, if not impossible, and the balance between a good and a disastrous outcome very fragile.
With this in mind, I think the director did a fairly good job, producing a movie that is overall enjoyable and definitely taking advantage of the nostalgia factor (very cleverly so). It was nice to watch a different version of the well-loved story. The brilliantly-executed CGI provides a realistic perspective, which is in my opinion the selling point of this film. Also, the experienced cast manages to give life and character to the story's protagonists. The iconic music of the original film is pristinely featured, with a few additions as a breath of fresh air.
The main problem with this film, however, is that the realistic approach to the cinematography unavoidably strips the characters of their emotions, which is one of the reasons why the original film was so loved, and that naturally seems very foreign and unwelcome. That also adds to the fact that, in my opinion, this remake film strayed away from being a kids' movie. With the realistic CGI and the noticeable lack of humour, a lot of scenes end up being too graphic and violent for the young audience, which should have been the target group for the film to be more successful. What I also noticed is that the music mixing had a few problems blending in with certain scenes and that kind of takes away some of its magic. Some scenes (e.g. the iconic opening scene and the Simba and Nala reunion) felt a bit rushed, too.
Overall, it was enjoyable to watch the film, but I think that it goes without saying that, when you think of ""The Lion King"", what comes to mind is the original film, and this new remake, no matter how well-executed it was, will probably not stick around as a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

The Circle of Life begins again.,"With all the live-action remakes Disney has been making as of late, it seemed inevitable that ""Lion King"" would be given the same treatment. Question is how do you even redo a film beloved by most, the very height of the Disney Renaissance? Jon Favreau took on the task having previously done ""The Jungle Book"", though I'd hesitate to really call this live-action given that it's mostly animation.I'd be lying if I said watching this on the big screen didn't make me feel nostalgic, getting chills when scenes like ""Circle of Life"" and the wildebeest stampede come around. Hans Zimmer's music is still a blast to this day. I also got some laughs out of the new jokes, including references to both the Broadway show and another Disney classic; Timon and Pumba are still pretty funny. The new cast gets credit for their vocal performances with only a few lines that felt off. Certain characters, dialogue, and moments were changed albeit minimally, occasionally to give new contexts or more believable actions such as Scar's plot to take the throne.Apart from one added scene, though, it's still the same movie, which may disappoint those expecting something truly new. Another issue is the crew's insistence on making this realistic led to a problem: most of the animals, despite their vocal inflections, lack facial expressions, making it harder to connect with them in the especially emotional scenes. It's strange given that Favreau allowed the animals in ""The Jungle Book"" a wide range of expressions (heck, actual animals can be expressive from time to time). Some aspects like ""Be Prepared"" and Rafiki aren't as impactful as they did in the original and, while graphically detailed, the visuals don't pop as much, particularly during song sequences where the colors are more muted.""Lion King"" 2019 is a case of what I call giving a classic a new coat of paint. It looks nice, but it's still fundamentally the same thing. This left me conflicted. I still enjoy it, but at the same time I think more could've been done.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Watchable but pointless remake,The remake is not an improvement over the original. It tells the same story and most of the times it follows it shot-by-shot.

"if you are a professional critic, or haven't seen the movie, please read","In light of the terrible reviews and before it's out officially yet, I wanted to share some facts and some thoughts.1. It's essentially a shot-for-shot remake. You can have an opinion about that alone, but you have to know this going in. Don't be surprised as the movie starts, and then you want to hold that against it coming out. Find it within yourself how you feel about that now, then move past it. Because the only thing worse than a shot-for-shot remake, is if anything was changed from the original.
2. It uses state-of-the-art animation technology. This is stuff that wasn't around in 1994. It will be more photo-realistic. The animals won't have as animated or as personified facial expressions. It will be MORE real. Not totally real (as the movie wouldn't be in English, or any human language, and the lions would eat all the other characters in the first scene), just MORE real.
3. It uses voice actors that are more diverse and more relevant to culture and entertainment today, in 2019. Imagine being an 8-12 year old kid, watching the new Lion King, and growing up and listening to Beyoncé's music, experiencing Donald Glover in music or TV, seeing other actors in other great movies and hearing their voice and being like, ""wait, were they that voice in that lion king movie?"" And the world means something to them in that moment, and they feel like they just figured out a secret connection that no one knows but them, and they are slowly figuring out who they are and what kind of entertainment they like and and what speaks to them the most. It's beautiful. Just like we were when we realized Randy from Home improvement and Ferris bueller was simba, Darth Vader was Mufasa, mr bean was Zazu, Whoopi and cheech were hyenas, the guy from mouse hunt was Timon, and guy who sings tiny dancer and Bennie and the jets also sings all the movie songs we love.In conclusion, if you are in high school or older, THIS👏🏼MOVIE👏🏼ISN'T👏🏼FOR👏🏼YOU. The movie from 1994 used the best animation and best voice actors from its time, and was SO GOOD that it has impacted and left a mark on kids ever since. 25 years. But time has changed, and the same story and characters can do the same for kids from now into another 25 years. Your opinion of it does not matter. It wasn't created for you. It's not trying to please you. Sure, you could say Disney is trying to make easy money. Duhhhh. They are a movie company. That's their shtick. But years of work still went into respecting the original film, while creatively making it new.Still not enough? Then this movie is your step dad. He's not trying to replace your real dad. You and your real dad will still have a very close relationship. But your little siblings need a real dad, and that is what your step dad will be for them. Love your step dad for who he is. Do not hate him for something you yourself are accusing him of.Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
A visual delight lacking the heart and soul of the original,"To put it simply, weighed up against one another in a battle for ultimate supremacy, the original animated classic from 1994 would win the battle for The Lion King pride land in knockout fashion.Full of heart, soul, imagination and of course singalong worthy songs and emotionally powerful music, the Disney classic of old still stands up today as a worthy cultural touchstone and while this new virtually carbon copied version of the tale of Simba and his quest to act out his kingly duties is still entertaining enough, Jon Favreau's visually sumptuous yet instantly forgettable redo is a relatively cold and unnecessary cash grab from the global behemoth that is the mouse house.From the moment the film starts with the ""I see Kenya"" made famous in the original, as animals of all shapes and sizes gather to witness the unveiling of lion king Mufasa's newly born cub Simba, Favreau's film sets itself in motion to be a risk free affair that while stunning with its downright eye-popping mastery of visuals, fails to capture the audience's heart like the 1994 original did with ease, for those of all ages.It's a shame for such a visual feast that Favreau and his Disney bosses failed to think of new ways to add a different flavour to proceedings here, as while there's some neat visual gags, added jokes (mainly courtesy of the films MVP's Timon and Pumbaa, voiced by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen) and some of the songs remain a joy to listen to without bettering the original, this version of The Lion King plays it way to safe without doing anything else of note that would make you choose to watch this take over the briefer and more energetic original.Another curious element to the film is with Disney's insistence on going ""photo real"" they have managed like other live action re-doings to lose sight of some of the beloved characters that came to life in the original animations.Here of course we have our cute and adorable and eventually fearsome Simba, the feisty Nala, comic relief Zazu and many more of the characters many know and love (or despise) but with the realism attached to these once animated figures much of the simplistic wonder and stretching of the imagination disappears and so too does much of the whimsy and loveable aspects.Most notable in how the film deals with its musical numbers, as many will notice the outlandish nature of many of the original set pieces (such as Scar's Be Prepared Nazi like sequence or Can You Feel the Love Tonight taking place in the day time!) are now transformed into more plain set-ups that while looking great, lack the spark and memorability of what we've come to know and therefore expect.It all brings in to question the very being of these Disney reimagining's, that while perfectly watchable and seriously profitable (other than poor old Dumbo), makes one wonder what the whole point of the whole escapade is other than Disney taking a seriously easy route to making quick and easy money.If other future installments fail to add anything else of note like The Lion King, you can't help but feel much like the never spoken about Beauty and the Beast remake or the over praised Jungle Book, many of these experiences will go down as cold hearted money earners that very few would recall in future years as anything but entertaining distractions.Final Say -No doubt set to be one of the great box-office behemoths of all-time, this modern day Lion King provides much wonder for the eyes but offers very little else of note to lay hold on. Perfectly watchable but instantly disposable, Jon Favreau's film is a prime example that realism doesn't equal better when your film is stuck in auto-pilot.3 juicy grubs out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Somewhat Lifeless,"The Lion King is without a doubt one of the greatest animated films of all time ( if not THE greatest). It was already flawless, and so there was no reason whatsoever to remake it, especially if there is nothing new to be added to the story.
The visuals are breathtaking and unsurpassed, but the very realistic looking animals look rather awkward when they talk and show no emotion whatsoever, something that has been achieved exceptionally in 2D animation.

The technology impresses but the rest doesn't work as well as the original and money is the only reason it exists,"An impressive trailer and a lot of big names drew my eye to this film; the original Lion King is a regular in my house with the children so it is a film I enjoy. This remake is pretty much an update of the original in terms of technology, but the scenes, the dialogue, the songs, all pretty much stay as they were. This direct remake approach means that it invites constant comparison, which is a problem for the remake because it doesn't play kindly for it.Leaving the technology to one side for the moment, almost all aspects of it feel lesser, and I'm not entirely sure why it does. The cast is impressive and if everything else is the same why does it not work as well. Hard to say but the performances and songs are just not as good as the original; the example that sticks with me the most is Ejiofor, who is a great actor but his Scar is not as good as Irons' was in terms of the song or the dialogue. This continues down the line and really the only place that the film does better than the original is how well it portrays peril and danger - not just having it look 'real' although that helps, but just the intensity of the action scenes and the drama around them. Whether or not this is what you want to have been improved in a kids film or not is up to viewers choice, but mine found it a bit much at the end.The technology is impressive in terms of what it can do - the animation looks and moves in a totally realistic fashion and it is easy to think you are watching something 'real'. This is a selling point but ironically it is a big problem too, because it never stops being weird to see these 'real' animals delivering dialogue and singing. With the original this was not an issue because we accepted whatever these drawn characters do, but the realism works against what the film is trying to do, and it tended to distract me and prevent me getting into it. In the end, the conclusion I had to take as to why this film was made, was of course money. Nobody was bemoaning the animation limitations on the original, and nobody was crying out for a carbon copy remake - it was done to generate more revenue from old properties, which was a goal that was achieved.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

An Atrociously Abhorrent Abomination,"An atrociously abhorrent abomination that butchers every little thing that was great about Disney's crowning achievement, this photorealistic remake of The Lion King ranks amongst the worst crimes ever committed on film canvas. Brought to life by the studio whose greed knows no bounds, this unnecessary & unwarranted turd is the latest in Disney's new-found formula for making billions dollars more by simply cashing in on viewers' nostalgia. And if its box-office gross is any indication, it won't be the last.Devoid of heart, soul & creativity that made the original an undisputed masterpiece for all ages, this repugnant reiteration is a vomit-inducing version that sure looks pretty on the surface but is empty from within right down to the bottom. Had they superimposed the original audio recordings over its so-called realistic visuals, the result would still be a bit better than what the new voices, new scenes, new songs & new characters add to the final print. Everything feels off & out of sync about this one. Not a single thing clicks.Now I've got nothing but appreciation for the hardworking visual effects artists, for they just did what they were paid to do. And they did an excellent job at it. But the filmmakers' decision to realistically portray the animals also strips these characters of all the heartfelt emotions & genuine expressions they illustrated so vibrantly in the original. Nothing that happens in this story evokes our feelings or tugs our heart, not even THAT scene. Even the carefree duo of Timon & Pumba come off as annoying & insufferable this time. Also, several dialogues are similar and yet they don't deliver the same impact.Despite the longer runtime, there is a rushed feeling to it. The original characters exhibit no personality while new ones bring nothing fresh to the table. All its attempts at humour fall flat. The modifications in the music & songs department further ruin the viewing experience. And that Spirit song is so misplaced that it's actually facepalm-inducing. All in all, where the original basked in the rich imagery, limitless creativity, magical flair & pure escapism that the medium of animation provides, this visually striking yet emotionally bland & imaginatively bankrupt retelling offers a cinematic ride that can only be summed up as unforgivably cringeworthy.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Spectacular Visuals spoiled with Poor casting/ Directing,"Watching a remake of a classic like The Lion King you obviously watch with high expectations. I believe if you remake something you either keep the original script or change it entirely. But with this 2019 version they ended up in an awkward in between. Apart from James Earl Jones and Seth Rogan, I think the recast choices were poor. Though Beyonce may have been successful with covering the songs I did not find her the best fit for the voiceover enacting which to be fair is a difficult task and not for any actor. The transformation of Timon into a feminine gay male character did not fit in the original scenes and script. Young Simba's character is more arrogant and cowardly than the original which again didn't fit well. Rafiki lost some of his good scenes and is silenced most of the time. Over all the characters are with less emotion. And unfortunately although it is still a movie to enjoy (credit given to the original classic story and the spectacular visuals), you may leave disappointed a bit missing the original. Spectacular Visuals spoiled with Poor casting/ Directing",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Cinematic circle of life.,"'The Lion King (2019)' certainly looks phenomenal: its 'photo-realistic animation' actually looks photo-real (or pretty much as close to it as we've come so far) on more than one occasion. The environments often seem so real you could touch them, the water simulation is perhaps the best I've ever seen and the animals all move, essentially, as realistically as CG creatures have ever moved. However, this does mean that the movie lacks most of the flair usually associated with animated works, even going so far as to omit emotion in favour of realism. The characters, whom are all inevitably anthropomorphised to some degree, don't really emote. Aside from providing ample range in their vocal performances, they remain as stony-faced as animals of their kind usually do. It's lucky that, for the most part, the cast do a terrific job at conveying everything that needs to be conveyed. However, when the singing starts, the believability of the vocal work starts to stretch beyond its limits; it just doesn't look like these lions, with their limited jaw-range and general lack of visual articulation, are belting out the big notes that they're supposed to be. Again, it's a good job that the songs are as genuinely entertaining as they are. Sadly, the picture can't claim to own any of them - except for a couple of originals that seem strangely out of place. On top of that, the musical sequences themselves aren't all that inspired, especially when compared to the original 'The Lion King (1994)'. I mean, the big, colourful, montage-esque numbers from that flick are here replaced by often stiff and generally just sort of bland ones. The same is true, I suppose, of the whole affair. It doesn't change anything in terms of narrative but somehow makes things longer and less energetic. Of course, this is all in favour of its realist aesthetic, but it does make you wonder whether that's a wise choice. After all, why does this Shakespearean musical about talking lions need to be realistic? The end result is far less memorable than the 1994 classic; it's not as vibrant, lively or dynamic. It still tells an engaging, effective and occasionally emotionally-affecting story, though. I can't deny that it's a fair bit of fun. It's not so much new as nostalgic, almost like an experiment on a large scale. It ultimately doesn't really feel worth the effort, however, because I'd rather watch the original and I think pretty much everyone else would, too. In five years time, will this be remembered as a classic? No, it'll be remembered as a remake. It's a shame, as the technical work involved with it really is astounding. The true artistry required to make this work would probably have been better spent elsewhere. I suppose it's just a product of the cinematic circle of life, though. In twenty-five years time, I guess we can expect an animated remake of this (so-called) 'live-action' effort. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

You will find yourself throughout convinced that real animals were used. The film is funny, sad, tense, everything that the original was. I was very pleased to see the storyline remaining almost identical as it's not a plot that should be messed with.If I was forced to find fault, then I would say some of the voicing could have been cast better. On occasion it felt very slightly rushed in some of the scripting, but this is probably more of a case of expecting it to be identical to the original, and any newbies to it wouldn't notice.I would happily watch this again and again and again.

"A visually appealing, albeit pointless remake that adds almost nothing new","The Lion King 2019 is a CGI photorealistic adaptation of the 1994 Disney animated film of the same name. Directed by Jon Favreau (Iron Man, Cowboys & Aliens, The Jungle Book), it is a visually appealing, albeit pointless remake that adds almost nothing new.In the African savannah, Simba (voiced by JD McCrary), a young lion prince, eagerly waits until the day he takes over as king from his father Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). One day, Mufasa is murdered by his jealous younger brother Scar (voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor), forcing Simba to flee his kingdom or face a similar fate. After covering a great distance, Simba meets a meerkat and warthog duo named Timon and Pumbaa (voiced by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen respectively), who take him in and teach him their carefree lifestyle. Eventually, Simba learns that he must take responsibility and reclaim his rightful place as king from his wicked uncle.While it does showcase some nice use of colour and cinematography, The Lion King 2019 offers little else worth recommending over its animated counterpart. The story is the same as the original, the songs remain unchanged, and even most of the dialogue is word-for-word identical. At best, director Jon Favreau is merely a conductor of someone else's symphony, a far cry from his work on 2016's The Jungle Book, which took risks and felt refreshingly new. In addition to this, the photorealistic CGI often had the film at a disadvantage as it fails to convey any real emotion from the animals. In the 1994 film, the animal characters were able to look a variety of different emotions due to the artistic freedom of it being animated as a cartoon, whereas in this film, each animal looks stoic whenever they're supposed to be sad or angry. Overall, to the small percentage of those who haven't seen the original, this film may be alright, however, all others should stick with the 1994 classic instead.I rate it 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Pointless remake, strange average review score","This really was not worth making. The first one was a masterpiece, so the thinking behind a carbon copy with different performers and visuals is baffling.I might be in the minority, but the stage show did little for me - a lame remake. Somehow this film gives me the same feeling.when I flicked through hundreds of reviews on IMBD, I see that other reviewers are panning it beyond belief. How it is achieving an average score about 7 can only be explained by the number of people giving it an undeserving ""10"".Awaiting more original content rather than remakes. Some classics should simply be left untouched. They could do a bonanza remake of Mary Poppins with unbelievable effects, but redoing a historical masterpiece is unnecessary - as is the case with the Lion King.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Nostalgia,Watching this film was a real throwback to my childhood. So many hairs on the back of your neck moments. Timone and Pumba were excellent.

A Visual Spectacle - That's About It.,"The Lion King is possibly the crown jewel of Disney animation, being considered one of, if not the, best in the Disney lineup, and also making nearly $1 billion in 1994, which was unheard of at the time. Given that the remakes have been extremely profitable, having Lion King come up was inevitable. Unlike the others, though, this is practically a shot-by-shot remake of the 1994 movie. The only changes are very slight, with very little being added. Therefore, the story and characters aren't changed at all to any extent. While it's true that there's very little in the way of originality, it's still a great story and these are still the great characters we know and love. After all, the original isn't beloved for no reason.This movie has one major saving grace: it is also easily one of the most visually impressive movies of all time. It's up there with the likes of Avatar and Life of Pi. The levels of realism put into everything in this movie - the animals, the beautiful landscapes, the plants, everything about it is incredible. The downside is that CGI animals, while they do look fantastic, do not connect to the human audience the way the animated characters do. Take Mufasa's death for instance. In the 1994 movie, it's one of the all-time saddest movie deaths. Here, the emotional impact is largely drained because these lions don't emote the way humans do. That, and we all see it coming. It's partially made up for with the talented voice cast, but it's not enough to save it.The cast is full of all-stars. Donald Glover is Simba, Beyonce is Nala, and James Earl Jones returns to play Mufasa, which is awesome. The songs are there, for the most part. Circle of Life is great as always, Can You Feel the Love Tonight and Hakuna Matata are classics, and I Just Can't Wait to be King was reinvented, taking out the stuff that only works in a cartoon. Be Prepared got nerfed, which sucks because that song's awesome. There's a new one called Spirit. After all, you don't hire Beyonce just to give her one song, right? Additionally, Hans Zimmer's score, kept from the original, is severely underrated.Lion King is a movie that I'm glad I saw in theaters, if only for the visual effects. If it doesn't win the Oscar for visual effects, that's a disappointment. I wish I had seen it in IMAX or something like that. Aside from that, it's just the same story we've known and loved for the last 25 years. And, I must admit, having been born in the late 90's, it was pretty cool to see that opening shot on the big screen. After all, these movies are made for 90's and 00's kids as much as today's kids.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Misses the mark and is a bit messy doing it,"It's not as good as the original; think of your least favorite veggie, then spit it out. For some, it may take alright. The voice-overs, a few changed scenes, a few new scenes all leave something to be desired. They miss the mark; they are not as good as the old one. The queen lion starts off with a faux African accent that gets dropped later in the movie. The Be Prepared song really misses the mark. The voice-over for Scar comes close but it is not as good as the original which had more inflection and gravitas. I'm not going to lie; the live-action animation is surprisingly very good in some ways, something like black and white TV vs. hi-deft TV when comparing the former version with this version. However, the movie seemed to keep trying to lift off the screen as if I had 3-D glasses on. In fast scenes, the left and right sides of the screen went soft on the image while only the middle image stayed sharp. It seemed that foreground depth was not there. All the surfaces were consistently flat. The color scheme of some of the animals like elephants and giraffes was off but sometimes it was a grand slam with smaller creatures in the film. The animation almost got you there but then you realize it is like a video game. On its own, the film might have been better than OK but it was just OK because the former version was better. A win-win would have been to take this movie's animations and put them to the original soundtrack of the former movie. Younger kids will have a different set of expectations; they will see it and like it. It was close but the little bit of miss felt like a country mile. I am sure the folks behind the animation will see the film win awards but the movie overall was like warmed up left-over broccoli. The appearance might have been there; the taste just wasn't there. It all just simply did not come together on the execution. In fact, it was a bit of an execution of what came before.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Amazing,"Well I loved it. The original is my favourite Disney movie ever. I approached this remake with an open mind and an open heart. The animation is beautiful - the animals look so real. Some of the voices are a little disappointing but that's mainly because the originals were so individual and strong. I thought it was a little over long for younger children; my 7 year old was more intererested in his drink and my 12 year old was bored.
My favourite character is Musafa. Especially with the original voice actor. I always get the shivers watching the opening scene and the music is fantastic throughout the film.

Just another underwhelming remake from Disney,"The Lion King falls into the pile of dissapointing remakes that Disney has been pulling out recently.

For My Favorite (non-Pixar) Disney Cartoon...,"...It was wildly disappointing. As a kid who grew up in the 90s, Lion King is my most watched movie of all time, if not top 3. I can quote the entire movie line by line. Because of this, I knew exactly which lines were the same, which were changed, how they were delivered differently, and what they took out. It was painful to watch to say the least. Honestly, almost cringeworthy. MANY of my favorite lines and most quoted lines were not even in the remake. However, almost the whole movie was line for line the same. And the delivery of some of the lines that did remain, were just not done as well. Voice acting was weak in comparison. If you are going to basically do a line for line remake, why take away some of the best ones?! The Hyenas were completely nerfed and changed even though they were some of the funniest characters in the original. So literally all of their hilarious scenes from the OG were gone. 'Be Prepared' was butchered. Rafiki/Simba scene when he rediscovered himself was one of the lamest things ever in comparison and Rafiki was made to be lifeless cgi baboon instead of a crazy monkey full of character and jokes. Honestly there's too many to name - SO MANY MISSING LINES/JOKES. I have liked all the other live action remakes a lot, but this one missed the mark for me completely. Maybe it was too close to the heart to appreciate... all of my friends seemed to really like it. But if you were a lion king die hard like myself, you will hate this movie. Solid 3/10 only because it looked impressive. Honestly anyone who liked it, just didn't remember the original well enough. Because if you did it was a tragedy and a disservice. Never watching it again and not showing my future kids this version either. Booooooooo",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

The CGI is amazing. If you like your wildlife programmes you will probably enjoy it.
The voice actors didn't bother me as much as others. I think Glover does a good job with adult simba and liked Rogen as Pumbaa.I think where the movie fails or rather struggles is to keep the audience emotionally attached like the original but when you're using real life looking animals it is going to be difficult.If you go to this movie forgetting about the original and not expecting that same magic then its pretty good. Its definitely watchable and does not deserve below 5 rating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
I LIKED IT.,"I really don't get why so many people are hating on this movie. Okay, you're right, it is basically the exact same movie as the 1994 version, but what else did you want them to do? I'm pretty sure that if director Jon Favreau gave a spin to the story and how it develops, people would still have hated on it. And then there's the argument that the animals show no facial expressions... Have you ever seen a lion or any other animal for that matter smile like the Cleveland Indians mascot? I think the movements of the mouth when the animals spoke were the creators' way of trying to have them show emotions. In a cartoon movie you have the freedom to basically do whatever you want with facial expressions, but in a real live action, it would have looked pretty stupid to see Simba shed actual tears.

Don't believe the 1 star reviews.,"This post is a direct response to the 1 star reviewers...
First off this is a scene for scene remake of the original 90s movie.. if you wanted something else then you are confused about the difference between remakes and reboots.
Secondly people seemed shocked that Disney are cashing in on their heritage, that's what they've done since (ironically) the original lion king.. do you not remember the truly woeful lion king 3? And all the cash ins since. This is not a new Hollywood concept people.As for the movie itself The CGI is nothing short of jaw-dropping, truly spectacular in every moment of the two hour run time.
Story and script wise it's almost word for word the same as the original (my favourite Disney cartoon).
The criticism about it being emotionless stems in part from the utterly life-like animals not having cartoon faces with over the top facial expressions, they are made to look completely real (except for the talking of course!) I loved seeing ""real"" animals on screen substituting for the now outdated 90s cartoon versions.
Yes there are some casting missteps, in particular Beyonce.. if you like her over-singing style then great but the delivery of her acting lines is incredibly wooden.
Is this movie a masterpiece? No, not even close as it plays it far too safe in copy and pasting the original but It's a faithful remake of a Disney classic using achingly beautiful imagery and that makes it so much better than 1 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

A remake of a film that didn't need to be remade.,"What is the point in remaking The Lion King when its still fresh in the minds of most of the population of the world? It's still relevant enough to where merchandise is still being sold and the original movie is played very often on television. What is the point in trying to make it appear photo-realistic when you will not get the same display of emotion that was seen in the original animation? Is Disney really in dire need of the money? They make billions almost every month off of movies, television, digital streaming, physical home media sales, toys, novels, comic books, theme parks, cruise lines, and video games as things already are. I understand that nostalgic value can equate to serious financial success and that there is something that does create a smirk when the magic of the original is recreated in a new way but the thing is the 1994 classic is still fondly remembered and has been seen by most of the youth of today so comparisons to said 1994 classic are going to happen in more ways than one and no matter how good the effects are and how well the performances it is really a near shot-for-shot retelling with nothing new to offer and will have more people re-watching the 2D animation over it. The people I saw it with couldn't help but point out what was missing and the general lack of emotion expressed from the characters, they all got a big laugh from Timon and Pumbaa who I will admit were pretty good but nowhere as charming as the original. The effects of course are great, many times I was surprised it was all computer generated, but as said earlier because they set out for photo realism the characters can only express their emotions to an extent and as such do not do enough justice for the lively voice work.

Disney's Missed opportunities,"This is my first movie review and I have very mixed emotions about this film. I understand that this is a film that several people worked tirelessly on and that it took a lot of their time, energy and passion into making this film. Expectations were already extremely high for this.Pros: The stars of this film were the animators, the folly artists, the art department, the sound department etc. The ""real life"" animation was very appealing. The animators worked hard to make every detail and movement of the animals as life like as they could and how they drew from real life animal interactions. All of the people who worked hard to create this film deserve a lot of credit for their hard work. They should have been the ones promoting this film.Cons: I have the same reactions as others here so I won't repeat what they have said but:When I was younger and would watch a Disney or any animated film, my family and I would see a movie based on its story and the characters. We didn't know famous actors as children and we didn't care if one particular actor was in an animated movie or not. I still think that this rings true for my children today. They know of actors but they do not care who's in the film. Disney and other studios are choosing actors based on who they are rather than finding a better fit. As an adult I know who the actors are in this film and because I know who the actors are it took away from my experience. You can recognize their voices and reference them to another film/tv show/ etc. While all of the actors in this film are talented I believe in giving other actors an opportunity to showcase their talents and Disney like other studios continues to help make wealthy actors even wealthier. I think I would have focused more on the storyline had it been different from the first one if the animation had more facial expressions and if the actors were completely new. Furthermore Disney could have created more speaking roles for this film to add new character development and again give other an opportunity at employment. Disney makes a lot of money and as an adult I'm tired of feeling forced to watch a film with a certain actor or group of actors because of who they are. I think the enjoyment of movies for myself and family has been taken away over the years because Hollywood continues to use the same group of actors over and over again. Like in the Lion King the Lions of the film mattered more than the humble giraffe.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
WHY DO PEOPLE HATE THIS?!,"Ok. First of all I am just gonna make this clear: I FRICKIN LOVE THE LION KING. The original is one of my all time favorite movies so I was very excited, but also a bit worried about the new one.
Luckily, the movie is amazing!
Is it the same movie? Well, yes and no.
The characters and the plot is off course the same. But the super realistic looking animation makes for a very different experience. There are very little changes to the actual plot. But there are some small changes, and they actually make the movie better. They have taken the stuff that worked in the original, and then put out the stuff that didn't work as much or that could be done in a different way. They have also changed some stuff so it could work in a realistic looking environment.
Is it better than the original? No, but it doesn't have to be. As long as it honors the name of The Lion King, and it certainly does that.
The animation is great, the voice-acting is great, the songs are great, and the story is the one we all know and love.
If you like the original I highly recommend this movie. If you haven't seen the original, I will also recommend it. I watched it with a couple of people that haven't seen the original, and they both loved it.

The live action Lion King comes across as a well-known nature documentary with a different look.,"The Lion King is a live-action film version of the 1994 animation film of the same name. The film is directed by Jon Favreau, the director of Chef, Iron Man and he also directed the live-action version of The Jungle Book in 2016.The film is set in the African savannah where a new heir to the throne is born, the young lion Simba (voice of JD McCrary). Simba is the next king of their kingdom after his father Mufasa (voice of James Earl Jones). Simba his uncle Scar (voice of Chiwetel Ejiofor) has lost his place as the future heir to the throne with the birth of Simba. Scar comes with a dark plan to still be king.
When Scar executes his plan, Simba is banned and ends up in unknown territory. In this area Simba meets the carefree duo Timon (voice of Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (voice of Seth Rogen). Together with these two, Simba grows up with a carefree life. When the now mature Simba (voice of Donald Glover) meets his old girlfriend Nala (voice of Beyoncé Knowles) again, he is confronted with his past. In this way he is faced with the choice to continue his carefree life or to return to his ancient kingdom and to assume his rightful title as king, but for this he must make the mistakes he has made in the past undergo and see to rectify.This new live-action film from Disney is actually not a real live-action film, because all the animals in the film are placed in the film with good CGI. All African places and backgrounds were also placed in the film with a green screen. With the live action of The Jungle Book, Jon Favreau managed to capture the animals and the jungle in a realistic way in 2016, making it seem like you were really in the jungle as a viewer. With this film, Jon Favreau and his technical team have managed to improve the effects. This makes the film look even more realistic than The Jungle Book and looks like a nature documentary about the African savannah with the story of The Lion King.
To keep the film realistic, the animals do not really show their emotions with their posture as they do with the animation. The animals communicate and show their emotions more with their body language and attitudes. So as a viewer you have a lesser emotional bond with the characters compared to the animation. The emotional moments are the same as in the animation, but do not have such an emotional effect as they do in the animation.Because the story of The Lion King animation is actually a perfect story that you do not need to change anything about, they have not really done that with this live action film either. So this new film comes across as familiar if you know the animation version. A few minor adjustments have been made, but these do not change the familiar story. In the live-action filming of other Disney films such as Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast, they managed to adjust the films a bit to give it a different and individual style and also to give it a more modern look. stop.Most of the voice acting is done well in this film, but if you are familiar with the animation it may take some getting used to hearing the famous characters with a different voice in this film. Fortunately, James Earl Jones can be heard as the voice of Mufasa, but just like when he returned as the voice of Darth Vader in the Star Wars spin-off Rogue One, you can hear that he has grown older. The younger actors, who speak to the young versions of the animals, do a bit better work than the older actors, because with the young characters you can still hear a little emotion in their voices. With the older cast you hear the emotions less in their voices, which is probably done to keep it fitting with their emotionless facial posture. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan do their voice acting in an appropriate and comical way. Seth Rogan's unique smile is also nice when Pumbaa has to laugh in this film.
The singing work is also done well and in an appropriate way by the cast. Beyoncé and Donald Glover are both singers and are suitably cast in the front of this film. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan do sing in a somewhat lesser way, but this fits in with their characters. Most famous songs from the animation can also be heard in this film, but in a somewhat different way. Artist Pharrell Williams has done his best to bring the music back in a good way in this version of The Lion King. Hans Zimmer is also the composer of the soundtrack for this film, just as he was for the animation. In this way he brings the soundtrack back in a slightly modified, but also in a well-known way in this version.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
WHY ON EARTH are people putting bad reviews!?,"What an absolutely outstanding remake and everyone who was involved in putting it together should be so proud.Funny, uplifting but also got you on the edge of your seat. Whilst the CGI was incredible, I appreciate there are some valid points on the slight lack of emotion detected in the characters faces, however, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't recall working with CGI easy.This is the first time I've submitted a film review having felt passionate to stand up against this irrational negativity. There is no valid reason to put submit a low rating.Excellent film, no question about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
next gen King,"Greetings again from the darkness. If you have come here to read yet another take on how this next-gen remake of a beloved film doesn't bring anything new to the story, you've come to the wrong place. I love cinema as an art form, and when analyzing a movie, I typically look for the good and enjoyable, rather than focusing on every element I might be able to criticize ... never forgetting that the on screen presentation is the culmination of work performed by many dedicated people so that I might sit back in a comfy seat within the confines of an air-conditioned theatre and be entertained for a couple of hours. And entertained I was.It only takes a few moments for the awe to set in. The look is at times so realistic that kids may actually believe animals can talk. More than once the fur of an animal or the splash of the river reminded of a National Geographic program with ultra-High Definition photography. So let's clear up something right now. This has been labeled as a ""live action"" remake of the animated classic from 1994. You should know, even if your eyes tell you otherwise, that there is nothing ""live"" in the film. Instead, everything you see on screen is computer-animated/generated. No, the lions and elephants aren't real and neither are the trees or distant mountains. The look of the film is as revolutionary as when the first TOY STORY stunned us in 1995. We had never seen animation like that then, and we've never before seen computer effects like this. What is familiar are two early songs, ""The Circle of Life"" and ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"".Of course, neo-realism can be admired only as a technical achievement when we are discussing a movie in which lions talk and warthogs sing. So while we marvel at the technical achievement, let's not lose sight of the story ... what made the original so popular and beloved 25 years ago. Although it's approximately a half-hour longer than the original, this one is exceedingly close to a scene-for-scene remake. Only minor tweaks will be noticed, mostly in the demeanor of Scar and the banter between Pumbaa and Timon - each actually improving on the first film. What remains is the coming-of-age story that will now touch many new hearts and minds.Kids will be immediately entranced with the cubs, Simba and Nala, voiced by JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph (the daughter in Jordan Peele's US), and with Zazu (voiced by John Oliver), the goofy and comical bird tasked with keeping an eye on the two adventurous youngsters as they get themselves into trouble. James Earl Jones (now 88 years old) reprises his iconic voice role as the wise Mufasa, and Alfre Woodward voices Sarabi, the pride's leading female. Chiwetel Ejiofor is excellent as the bitter Shakespearian villain Scar, but I couldn't help but wish Jeremy Irons had returned for this interpretation of the jealous and power-hungry brother of Mufasa.The energy level jumps once Simba meets Pumbaa the warthog and Timba the meerkat. Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner take the comedy routine to a new place, and we can only assume much of their banter is off-script. Kids may not get every joke, but they are sure to respond to this odd couple. Donald Glover and Beyonce voice the grown Simba and Nala, and both are outstanding - especially with their singing (no surprise there). Nala's role is expanded a bit ... as expected when you cast Queen Bey. Her original song ""Spirit"" is included but it's her duet with Glover on ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" that is a real musical standout.Director Jon Favreau has been in the chair for such hits as IRON MAN 2 (2010), IRON MAN (2008), and ELF (2003), and he was also behind Disney's live-action remake of THE JUNGLE BOOK (2016). The writing credits belong to Jeff Nathansan (CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, 2002) for the screenplay, Oscar winner Brenda Chapman (BRAVE, 2012) for the story, and Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton for the characters. The latter three were among the 28 writers credited for the 1994 version. Also back is composer Hans Zimmer, who won an Oscar for his 1994 score, and songwriters Elton John and Tim Rice, also Oscar winners for their 1994 song, ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"".The beloved 1994 version didn't win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature film because the award didn't exist until 2002; however, it did spawn the 1997 Broadway smash musical. This more realistic version is rightly rated PG rather than G, as some of the scenes are likely to be a bit intense for younger viewers. And it's important to remember that this version is meant to bring Simba's story to a whole new generation - it's not meant to replace the 1994 version for those who were kids when it came out so many years ago. The story and characters, while familiar to those age 30 and up, will be a whole new viewing experience for today's kids. So while we may prefer the 1994 animated version, kids today will likely be enthralled by this updated look. And we all better get used to it, because Disney has 18 more ""live action"" remakes in the works (some of which will actually be ""live"" action).",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Disney ran out of original ideas,"For the last 10 years disney has been making nothing new but recycling their old classics. Yet many of them are really bad.

respect and making dough,"It's the realistic CGI rendering of the 1994 Disney animated classic. I don't love the original but I do respect the Shakespearian jungle book. It hasn't changed for this new version. I still don't like Simba but a little less this time. Instead of a brat, he's more of a clueless kid. Scar's villainy seems less cartoonish and more threatening. It's the heart of the change for the new movie. The CGI rendering is very realistic. The cartoon animation is a memory in the back of the mind. I'm reminded of all the nature films and that's where the trouble begins. While the rendering is correct, these are not real animals. It's jerry-rigging a human story into the animal kingdom. For some reason, it's fine for a cartoon since that's fake. This feels real and yet it's fake. That dichotomy annoys me. So different things annoy me in the two versions of this movie. I still respect the heck out of it although Disney is not adding to the culture by continuously redoing the same movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Waste of time, money grab","TLK is one of my favorite Disney classics, so while I didn't understand the need for a remake, I did look forward to seeing it with the full theatrical experience again. Boy was I wrong.The core failure of the movie is the inexplicable choice to go fully photo-realistic with the animation. There is zero, and I can't stress this enough, ZERO expression or emotion in the characters' faces. Sure, it's zoologically accurate, but why does that matter when your plot is a conniving lion plotting a political coup with another species?The voice acting was.....barely passable. Nothing remarkable, especially given the A-list names on the cast. Timon and Pumba were the high flyers here, and even they were a pale shade of the excellent originals. Classic musical numbers were either underwhelming or over-performed (looking at you, Beyoncé).All of this is made even more obvious by the fact that the movie is nearly a shot-for-shot, line-for-line copy of the original. Timon and Pumba had some clever self-aware lines that poked fun at that fact, but given how closely they mimicked the original, it's remarkable that the final product managed to come out so flat in comparison.I don't know what this means for Disney's other forthcoming live action re-releases. Aladdin wasn't up to snuff either, but had the energy and character to make up some lost ground. I've not yet seen the Dumbo remake, and want to look forward to Mulan, but if this is where they're setting the bar, I'll wait until they come to Netflix.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Beautiful but Empty,"Although the new visual effects were outstanding and set new limits for future productions, The Lion King remake is just a shell of the former film in its creativity, adding little original material to make it compelling.The majority of the script is taken straight out of the animated film (excluding some new genius dialogue for Timon and Pumbaa) and is replicated dryly on screen. The realistic effects took away from a lot of the color and expression that made the original so great, and although the new actors did a fantastic job, it would be just as effective to play the sound from the original with the new footage.This movie is purely riding the coattails of the original, and proves that by needing to bring back actors such as James Earl Jones to get attention. I don't believe it was entirely useless due to the fact that there were some unique scenes (New material? Imagine that) but overall it nowhere near offered the brilliance that the 1994 film had.For those arguing that ""Walt Disney put in his will to remake his movies every 10 years"" where are the 10 year remakes of Pinocchio? Or Bambi? Using that excuse won't work on this one. The truth is that some of these Disney Masterpieces should NOT be remade and this is the case for The Lion King.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Tries to do the Impossible,"This film tries to ride a fine line between portraying animals as realistically as possible while also trying to stay as true to the original animated film as possible. The problem is that the original included cartoony aspects (like an elephant crushing Zazu, Timon filing Simba's nails, etc). The other problem is that real animals don't really show emotions in their facial expressions. So it was impossible to stay true to the original 1994 version.The animation is incredible- they were going for realistic looking animals and that's what they achieved. The problem is those animals don't show emotions. So when you're seeing a sad moment, the faces of the characters aren't sad-looking.Pros: Timon and Pumbaa, some of the songs, amazing animation

The King of Soulless Lazy Cashgrabs,"Disney has managed to hit rock bottom by turning arguably their best Disney movie of all-time into one of the biggest pile of garbage I have ever witnessed on the big screen. Imagine all the colour, emotion, life, magic, joy, and personality sucked out all in an instant from one of your all-time favourite movies. That's this 2019 Lion King remake in a nutshell. As the end credits were rolling, I felt nothing. I didn't care about anything. I never felt sad, happy, overjoyed, or any emotion the entire time. I was soulless, just like this entire movie was. It was Disney at their absolute worst. They took the weakest and blandest possible way out of making this movie. If you've watched the 1994 original, you've seen this movie, and anything they added or changed was pointless filler or bad changes that made the movie much, much worse than you could have ever imagined.Why would I want to see lifeless versions of my favourite songs with the dullest visuals and animals doing nothing interesting just so this movie can stay ""Realistic""? I have no idea but someone thought it was a good idea! Was it worth it Jon Favreau? Improving your visuals so much that the goddamn animals can only open their mouths and do nothing else with their movement? Oh right, animals can't emote properly because they can't emote much in real life! Geez, I wonder why in the original Animated version these Animated characters had over-exaggerated features to be like Human beings? Oh right, so we can emotionally connect with them! It doesn't translate very well in ""Live Action""!You can imagine alot of these shot-for-shot sequences being much worse in this ""Live-Action"" CGI remake. Scenes were dumbed down or replaced with crappy alternatives because the CGI animals couldn't do them in the movie or had no emotion to pull it off. In one of the most iconic scenes of the original movie, the audience were laughing at a very serious scene that is played to extreme
dramatic effect because of how dumb it looked in ""Live-Action"". There is nothing funny going on in this scene at all. They turned one of the most emotionally devastating sequences of the original movie into a huge embarrassment. How could you do that? Why do we feel nothing for Simba and these other characters? Why do almost all the voice performances feel like they only used the first take out of so many of these talented actors? Very dull and uninspiring.They butchered the villain Scar big time as well! In the original he was a sly, snarky, sarcastic, and quotable evil Lion with so much personality and wit behind him. In the new one he just sounds like a generic bad guy Lion who is always angry. In fact, I didn't even notice it was Scar at first! They made all the animals look so realistic you can't tell some of them apart until a character mentions them or you connect the dots with their lines taken from the original, which I have to say was very lazy as it was basically like 90% of the same dialogue. Thanks for also butchering one of my favourite characters Rafiki by the way. Even though you guys were basically doing a shot-for-shot remake, you got rid of his best moments for no reason! Timon and Pumbaa now have unfunny jokes constantly and just feel like pale imitations of their originals who were so beloved back then.What about the filler and new stuff? Well, you get one forgettable song sung by Beyoncé in it. It doesn't fit the tone of the movie at all and just felt like Disney had to add some random song in there so they could get the Best Original Song Oscar nomination. Shenzi the Hyena is now the leader of all the Hyenas but it doesn't really go anywhere or develop her character at all. There's a new scene which shows Nala escaping the Pride Lands ruled by Scar that is just padding and adds nothing to the table at all. The Lion Sleeps Tonight gets a bit more screentime but it's just showing off bugs and animals and nothing more.
There's probably more but I've already forgotten alot about this movie. They changed some of the dialogue here and there, and most of the time it's worse jokes or lines that don't feel natural at all. Even stuff like cinematography, music, and line delivery all felt off and unprofessional in large parts of the movie.You know? The more I think about this remake, the more I get angry about it and I wish someone would just snap this piece of trash out of existence. The original was close to perfection already, so why bother remaking this movie? This is the laziest Disney cashgrab I have seen so far, and I'm getting sick of them releasing these ""Live Action"" movies being made over and over again now, but it doesn't matter because Disney is going to make loads of money anyway. This Lion King remake in particular was easily the worst one so far, because all it needed to do was rely on the brand and make the exact same movie again bring absolutely nothing new to win people over. What happened to artistic integrity, originality, or effort? I hate having to think this stupid movie exists with the original now.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

"dreamy visuals, nothing else","""Nostalgia is a file that removes the rough edges from the good old days""- Doug LarsonFinding joy in nostalgia when it comes to movies is rather easy. The sense of growing up with characters, and having them influence the person that you may have become is such a strong sentiment. These memories cannot be taken away, and that is true for the Lion King remake.The 2019 Lion King version is impressive- the painstaking efforts that have gone into making the visual effects come alive are to be experienced. In 2019, going gaga over visuals effects is pretty much passe, but still The Lion King is downright astounding. The thing is that beyond the visuals, there is little else that it adds to the original, which in my humble opinion, was a seminal movie. The script, music, the voice acting, the traditional animation remains unparalleled till date.Replace traditional animation with modern live motion capture, and the 2019 version is a shot for shot remake of the 1994 original. All the animals assemble as Simba is born, and as he grows up with his best friend Nala, Mufasa explains to him the circle of life. Scar plots with the hyenas to kill Mufasa, and Simba is chased out of the Pride Lands. He meets Pumba and Timon and grows up with them leading a hakuna matata life, till Nala comes to get him back to his rightful place as king. Scar gets his comeuppance and Simba completes the circle of life when his newborn cub is presented to the assembled animals.Had it been a National Geographic special, there would have been no equal- please take that as a compliment, Lion King. However, even with a stellar voice cast with James Earl Jones reprising Mufasa 25 years on along with Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Beyonce, John Oliver and Chiwetel Ejiofor, Elton John's all-time classic songs, the movie lacks the emotional impact that the original was able to create. Call it corporate greed, lack of creativity and artistry or just plain laziness- nostalgia notwithstanding, it brings nothing new to the table. Director Jon Favreau did a much better job with 2016's The Jungle Book, which, in my mind is one of the best live action remakes ever.But hey, whatever Disney touches these days turns to gold. The Lion King will might make a few billion for sure, and kids will surely enjoy this round too, but Simba's roar is decidedly low this time round.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Beautiful but lacking heart.,"Visually stunning that's the most important thing to note here. It's true to the original without being a flat out copy.

They tried to compensate and there were instances they succeeded like the Belle and the Beast scene that Timon did in place of the Hula scene in the original. But they didn't manage to make the hyena's as crazy and menacing.

What is with the bad reviews???,"I mean seriously?
It's impossible to make people happy! Its hard to turn something into live action and change things around to fit into the live action area. Half of these 1* ratings are just angry in general because they don't like what Disney is doing with their animated features because they think that they are too close to the original or because they love the originals too much and don't want them remade. Then the other half of the 1* ratings are because they changed things and they are not word for word exactly like the originals.....
Disney has done it all, so now they are focused on turning their wonderful animated features into live action movies. I personally absolutely LOVE what they have been doing!!! All of them, we have been collecting them all as well can through the Disney Movie Club... My kids have absolutely loved them as well, and it has been nice to have a few movies this summer (mostly Disney) that I have been able to take them to see. My daughter and I are especially looking forward to The Little Mermaid!!!
As far as I am concerned they can remake all of their animated features and we will see them all and collect them to add to all the animated features we have collected (which is all of them). The basic stories of most have been the same with some change to the details line wise (I have the animated movies memorized at this point and the movies do differ a tad in detail) ... A couple have deviated a bit i.e. Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty) and Dumbo, but they are all wonderful and we have loved all of them so far including Aladdin, The Lion King and my absolute favorite Beauty and the Beast.

Of course I know the answer, especially from the viewpoint of the 21st Century Disney film Empire they bring in huge box office dollars and that's ok I suppose but I wonder what Walt Disney would have thought?The Walt Disney Studios under Walt always were striving for originality and breakthrough new projects. You only have to look at some of the extra features on Classic Disney DVD's to see how the Animators and technical teams worked expertly and together with Disney to bring something new and exciting to the screen. Unlike Studios today risks were taken like Snow White the first feature length movie cartoon that nearly everyone said would be a financial disaster but that risk saved the Walt Disney Company from bankruptcy.This Lion King remake features photorealistic CGI animals that look like the real thing so basically it's really another animated feature . Many creative and talented people have put together a pretty fair version of the 1994 original even featuring James Earl Jones repeating his original voice over as Mufasa.The problem with this version for me was unlike the fabulous 1997 Broadway musical version directed by Julie Taymar which added great songs ,choreography and gave audiences a brand new version which featured spectacular production numbers and amazing puppetry this new film adds nothing .In fact Director Jon Favreau has made a much darker version and seems to have cut back on the music and the humour. I found many of the scenes too dark visually apart from the beginning and the end it seemed to concentrate on the horrible hyenas and Scar .I might be wrong but I think very young children would be frightened by this Lion King movie , better to watch the original and best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Amazing!,This was such a good remake of the original. It truly did it justice in a way that no other Disney remake has done. Amazing cast and the music was incredible. Can't rate it better!,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
It's better than they say,"Wayyy back in the day I remember seeing this as a child. I remember the feelings it gave me. Seeing this 25 years later, it reminds of how good this story actually is. It is really neat to see how this remake has used photo realistic animals. I must admit that at first it is a bit odd to see them speaking but I got over it pretty fast. The parts with young Simba , Timone and Pemba were my favorite. They even throw a bit of meta humor in there for those of us that know Hakuna Matata by heart. Once he grew older was a delight as well with Donald Glover and Beyoncé. Beyoncé is and will always be a highlight in anything she is a part of. Some of the other parts suffered like Scar. I remember him being more theatrical. They didn't give him his campy sneer that I enjoyed from Jeremy Irons in the original. Having James Earl Jones back is pure magic. His voice is so iconic to Mufasa. The setting is beautiful. With everything looking so real it's surprisingly not as exciting at the same time. Sadly I was more taken in by the story when I was a child. Which I am sure your kids will take to this one as I did the original. Families will love it as well as animal lovers. This is a pretty straight forward remake. If you loved the original you will enjoy this. If you didn't then you should probably see something else because it isn't any different. Definitely worth the watch!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
An updated version of a Disney classic,"25 years after the original was released, Disney has introduced The Lion King to a new generation. This is a movie that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible , in order to be able to appreciate the mindblowing VFX, which are some of the best ever put on screen. The new cast does a good job at portraying the classic characters and givning them a fresh feel. The music segments of the movie worked really well, the same can be said about the animals facial expressions, which had many concerned that they would look ""emotionless"" due to the realistic direction, thankfully this is not the case and the animals emotions work very well. Overall this is a movie that sticks very close to the source material but makes it feel new and fresh thanks to incredible VFX, a new cast and extensions/alterations of certain scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Stop being so bitter and enjoy it for nostalgia!,"For me as a big fan of the original 1994 The Lion king as my family and i watch it alot back in the days and is probably my favorite Disney animated movies of all times!So me and my family went to the cinema and when the circle of life started to play, me and my family went really exited also in many other scenes cause you knew what was coming for the most part.For the most part i mean that people say that this is a shot to shot remake of the original and that is incorrect. The thing is that they are some shot that has been remade just to fit in good in this live action movie, like for example the one where the animals is like standing above eachother and so.
Also they putted out some new scenes that made some more charisma to some character, like Timon and Pumpa.In the cinema Everyone was laughing laud and was quite in exictment scenes or more seriouse and of course the one scene we all knew was coming... yep get my tissues already.But i recomend it for nostalgia and to see a more light up and is a change for a whole new genaration to see this as they may have not seen the original.

"Great CGI, but missing the magic","The CGI is undoubtedly amazing, but for fans of the original you may be left a little dissapointed. The expressions even in tone of voice for some of the lines were lacking, the remake of for example ""be prepared"" song - very poor, it lacked the emotion and magic of the original in many scenes. Where other remakes have added new songs or deviated a little from the original story to add something unique, this was a little 'too' alike the original.

Let's retell this story without feeling,"CGI is great with beautiful lighting and a very cute baby Simba. Sadly, the music was massively underwhelming with 'phoned in' vocals by 2 of R&B's reputedly finest vocalists Beyoncé and Childish Gambino. And why are the best moments of this PC 'child friendly' version - though spectacular sonically and visually - the most violent parts of the story? All of the poignant and hilarious moments of the original movie have been diluted and in some instances, surgically removed. Are the makers seriously catering to a new generation of kids that will suck up and feast on this modern way of telling stories? I had to see it once but hope to never see it again and look forward to crying and laughing at the original some day soon.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

SO DISAPPOINTED!!!,"This movie brings absolute disgrace to the original film, and to Disney as a whole in my opinion.
The ""fourth wall"" is broken a few times in attempts to make cheesy jokes, absolutely ruining the story.
This film, had so much potential, but I'm sad to say it can not even compare to the original.
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Buy a copy of the original movie and show that to your kids and family. Not this garbage they're calling a remake.Don't get me wrong, the CGI (or whatever it is) is breathtakingly beautiful. Everything looks extremely real! But, the magic just isn't there.Don't think I'm someone who is against remakes/live actions of classics! I love the idea, but it's only good when executed properly!

Don't listen to the haters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Good but perhaps a little too realistic,"The movie definitely succeeded in bringing the feelings of nostalgia and the voice actors did well. However, the hyper-realistic cgi didn't allow for the full emotions to show through. We lost a lot of the feelings by not being able to see the more human-like expressions you could relate to in the cartoons like furrowed eyebrows or teary eyes or big smiles etc. Instead it was kind of like those instagram videos where people do voice overs for animals in funny situations except with super HD national geographic type visuals. I think they could've gone for realism but held back some in the faces of the animals to allow for some of that emotion to still show through.I wouldn't buy it or necessarily choose to see it again but I enjoyed it for what it was in the moment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Thanks Disney for ruining my childhood memories apart.,"Emotionless. Too focus on CGI. Let me suggest to make this easier for you. Just use the old voices, and create the animation based on that. And please put some emotion. There are no point try your best to make it close to a real life lion and sacrificing all good emotions. It's just a small thing compared to what you have done to the movie. If you really want to make it so real, then it's better make them a real animal which cant talk.I am really frustrated and mad. My wife and kids wanted to watch other movie but I convinced them that this is the best movie in my childhood. I want to take all my words back. You failed miserably this time Disney. The Jungle Book was better in terms of emotion CGI in a real animal faces.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Beautifully made,"I am not a fan of the original animated movie, it is a little too sad for me. However, the musical is the best I have ever seen.So this movie for me is a bit the same as the animated one. But I have to say, it is made beautifully. Sometimes it feels like you are watching a nature documentary.This movie is half an hour longer than the original, and I was hoping they would incorporate some of the musical bits. But that was not the case to my dissapointment.Beyonce was a distraction to me, I do not need a lion sounding like a worldwide known singer. And I did not like the original song that she sings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Stick to the original films,"Here is the thing about Disney. to make more $$$ they decided to make live action remakes to their classic animation films.
now that's a brilliant idea if we talking about films like.....snowhite, maleficent, alladin, cinderella etc..etc......but not such a good idea if we talk about LION KING.
and the reason is we had an animation film...we have again a new animation remake. not a real live action film in the sense we have no real actors like we do with cinderella and the rest of the live action films.
that's cause we are dealing with animals this time so what's the need for A Useless remake ?
combined with the fact the original and best film and even it's sequel were far better than this remake in all aspects then if u need to watch lion king watch the earlier animation films again and ignore this useless remake which don't even have half the heart the originals had.
soundtrack was also bad compared to the 1994 score.Grade // C+",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Don't listen to the haters!,"This movie is amazing - don't listen to those who cracked the sads because they didn't want a remake so gave a bad review. The visuals are absolutely stunning and yes I'll say that the characters are lacking in visual emotion (not audible) but that's only for the realistic appearance of the characters - you aren't going to see a lion literally crying in the wild are you? The Lion King was a movie I watched everyday during my child hood and I was so amazed by the new graphics and how amazing the story was that I literally cried during almost the whole movie because I was so happy they didn't ruin it. Those complaining that all the lions looked the same, well I could easily tell them apart they literally looked like their cartoons but realistic obviously, or maybe that was just me because I've watched the original like 600 times. If there had to be flaws, it would be some unnecessary scenes that were just filler chapters and Beyoncé slightly oversinging Nala's parts, they didn't need to be so extravagant but honestly that doesn't take away from the movie at all.

will only deliver if you can completely disregard the original,"Not so much a live-action remake, but more of a photorealistic, CGI makeover of the animated feature about a lion cub born into royalty. Simba, the only son of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, lives peacefully in the Pride Lands but is a bit too eager to prove his courage and ability to rule. Unfortunately for Simba his embittered Uncle Scar won't genuflect, and will stop at nothing to take the throne. If you're capable of viewing this as a stand-alone feature (which isn't easy) then you can probably find some things to like about it...but--and it's simply unavoidable no matter how hard you try--when comparing it to the 1994 original it lacks the thrill, humor, and sheer emotional punch, despite some impressive visuals and a colorful assortment of vocal talents, including Jones whose reprise provides some much needed authority, along with Rogen and Eichner who seem perfectly cast. Unfortunately the spoken lines don't mesh well with the use of ""live"" animals, and the music doesn't resonate as well as it should. Despite any homages, in-jokes, or straight up replicas from the original film, the magic just isn't there; much of the time it feels like watching a leaden Animal Planet documentary. **",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

However, if you treat it as a standalone movie and enjoy it for what it is, you may actually like it.
Reviewers complain about the lack of emotions. This didn't bother me, nor did I even really notice it. Plus, it may have been a little weird to see ""real"" animals conveying much emotions.

Gorgeously pointless.,"After Dumbo earlier this year, now here is The Lion King: the live-action version of the prize coronation mug sitting on Disney's shelf of trinkets.I mentioned in my review of ""Toy Story 4"" that in comparing it with TS1, it ably demonstrated that Moore's Law of computing power must still be at least holding reasonably true. Here is another case in point. Technically, this is nothing short of astonishing. It's almost impossible to believe that what you are seeing is computer animated. Every mouse, lion and cheetah so vibrantly and perfectly visualised. That first sight of Simba draws an audible ""Awwww"" from the audience.The pièce de résistance of the film is the first 4 minutes, reproducing with ""live"" animals the ""tribute scene"" to the young Simba. It's visually and aurally gorgeous in every way, and worth seeing the film for in its own right.In ""Dumbo"", an OBVIOUS error is that ONLY mice and crows can talk to elephants - not humans! So here, it is distinctly unsettling that 'real life' animals can speak and sing. It's also inevitable that the animation of eyes and mouth, present in the original version, saps the scenes somewhat of emotion.I'd heard this mantra repeatedly in the critic reviews I'd seen, so was honestly bracing myself for the worst. In reality, it had less of an impact than I was expecting it to, and although never moved to tears at any point, the scenes that were supposed to be moving... were.As with the recent ""Aladdin"" remake, I found many of the songs distinctly underwhelming. ""I just can't wait to be king"" lacked the energy and verve of the original, and Chiwetel Ejiofor went the ""full Rex Harrison"" on ""Be Prepared"". So much so that the term ""song"" might be a misnomer.Above all ""Can you Feel the Love Tonight?"" was one of Elton John and Tim Rice's most beautiful songs from the original soundtrack. Yet, although not savaged by Donald Glover and Beyoncé (playing Simba and Nala), they at the very least give it a good mauling.The score by Hans Zimmer is lusciously produced. There is a new song added as ""Best-Song"" fodder for the upcoming Oscar nominations. This is ""Spirit"" by Beyoncé, although it failed to stir mine in any way. But the best new song on the soundtrack for me was Elton John's offering - ""Never Too Late"" - during the end titles. Complete with African instruments and vocals, it is both cracking and very stirring.As indeed happened in the original movie, the introduction of Timon and Pumbaa adds some much needed energy and humour. Played by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen respectively, director Jon Favreau encouraged the pair to ad lib many of their scenes. And it shows. There's a lot more fun to be had in there than all Will Smith's genie scenes in ""Aladdin"". In particular, the famous ""breaking the fourth wall"" moment in ""Hakuna Matata"" I found priceless, and made me howl with laughter.Elsewhere vocally, James Earl Jones is back as Mufasa and in so doing makes you concious that there is noone in the world who could perform that role better. The best performance of the rest of the cast, for me, came from ""Black Panther's"" Florence Kasumba as the leader of the hyena pack, Shenzi. She venomously spits her lines our quite wonderfully.TV pundit John Oliver is an interesting choice as Zazu, but didn't nail it for me. I personally missed Rowan Atkinson in that part. Likewise, comparison between Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeremy Irons as Scar is hardly fair. I'd rate Irons as one of the top 5 vocal performances of any Disney film of all time.For me, the word that keeps floating to the top of these live action remakes is ""pointless"". Why try, other than to fill Disney coffers? (Which I guess is the producer's point!) And my opinion hasn't changed after this. I still think its a rather pointless exercise, particularly in this case where there is no human cast.With these things, I always think of Jim Carrey's cry at the end of his version of ""I am the Walrus"". He screams ""There, I did it. I defiled a timeless piece of art"". Jon Favreau can at least sleep happy (sic) in his bed content that he hasn't managed to do that. I can't say I was horrified by this one, because I wasn't. It was majestic, entertaining, technically superb and certainly had its moments.The acid test for me would be ""would I go and see that again"". And in this case the answer would be ""yes"".(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies via Google or Facebook. Thanks.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Lion King,"Review By Kamal KThe Lion King wasn't really one of my favorite movies growing up, but I enjoyed it as a kid and you can't deny the great animation and great voice acting that still holds up. It's definitely a movie millions remember fondly of, and appreciate till this day.The 2019 remake of The Lion King however, doesn't carry the magic the original had. I must admit the obvious, and say that the visuals are spectacular. All the animals throughout the film look amazingly detailed and will definitely amaze everyone watching it, but the visuals are also one of this film's flaws. Unlike the animated classic, Simba, Mufasa, Scar, and Nala are now real-life lions that fail to show any emotion... because they're real-life lions, and lions don't exactly tend to show any emotion at all really.The voice acting has it's ups and downs, the voice actors for Cub Simba, Mufasa, Zazu, Timon, and Pumba really steal the show. But other's like Older Simba, Nala, Scar, Rafiki are just kinda...there, and only serve to sing covers for the originals already great soundtrack. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar really tries his best and I appreciate his efforts, but his representation of Scar doesn't come close to Jeremy Irons. I don't blame him for this, since it's most likely that he had to work with the original film's script.This movie is great...if you want to watch something you've already seen before that is. The digital artists have done some amazing work here but it feels like it lacks the emotion and soul of the original animation. The sound track is okay with Beyonce shining as you'd expect but again you've heard the songs before, you've felt the emotions and you know what to expect throughout. If you want to watch a shot for shot remake of an already amazing movie, or you've lived under a rock and never seen the original then this is the movie for you. Unfortunately it doesn't do enough to stand out from the original, to which it will always be compared, and there's a feeling the studio just played this one that bit to safe.If Disney start to worry a little more for making new movies than remaking its old successes only With the purpose of making tons of money I will consider to have a little more appreciation for this greedy company, I am starting to think that disney is Like the villian of the movie.Honestly whatever you rated the first movie rate this one the same minus one. Ultimately it is bland and boring with a lot of the humour taken out of it, still no acknowledgement as far as I noticed to Hamlet or Kimba. The American actors, save for Jones who is Mufasa and Glover who did well with what was there, were the weakest part, Eichner especially. The non-Americans outshined their counterparts and gave their characters depth even though they had so few lines. Ultimately the movie is underwhelming, and I would have liked to have seen more African born actors playing roles rather than singers with limited range.It's strange to see the hyper realistic CGI of lion king, as far as content. The animation for the movie is astonishing, although making it as real as possible loses its emotional touch. And that's what makes the movie flat. The emotional moments are usually the most gripping moments but because of the hyper realism they're just THERE in the moment. You don't see the emotions displayed thru the characters......Other than that, the film's story and music are phenomenal, but the original Lion King had already made those.........This movie is very difficult to believe because it is not very realistic.

Tremendous Film Ignore the Hate...Minor Flaws,"Not only was this an outstanding movie, it's an experience. Seeing it is truly believing it. You will be wondering if certain scenes are CGI or did they use real animals? The script is true to the original (as far as I can remember) but the visuals are unparalleled.My only complaints were the casting. Sorry guys....Beyoncé is a generational talent but that talent ain't acting. Her performance felt wooden. Like it was being read not performed. And I get that Danny Glover seems to be the flavor of the month but he too seemed disinterested with the role. I'd have preferred two nobodies who were gifted voice actors. Let's be honest. NOBODY should see this because Beyoncé or Glover are in it. I'm not even an Elton John fan but when movie's signature song plays I couldn't help but feel let down with Beyoncé's lesser rendition. That said, at no time did this ruin the film.My son was not happy when he learned he was seeing this movie. He never connected with the original but he along with myself and wife loved this one. Great family entertainment.I hope those writing/reading these reviews keep in mind that this is a child's movie and in my opinion the ideal kind. One where the parents are entertained as well. If you're a non-parent and reviewing this and think it was bad or not as good as the animated original ....do me a favor...come back in ten or fifteen years and update your review. Bet when you watch it with your little one you'll understand the greatness of the movie. Appreciating the significance of the movie's message which every parent experiences as they face their mortality, while praying they've prepared their children to take the reigns in our own circle of life. It definitely had a powerful effect on me. Not sure I'd make that claim if I didn't see this with my son.We are all Mufasa. We are all Simba. And we all know and battled a Scar. I suspect your opinion of the movie will coincide with your current placement within the circle of life. Happy Viewing",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Y'all are ridiculous,"This movie was done so well, and I'm so disappointed in people who give this such low ratings. Let me start by saying that the animated movie has been my favorite since I was nearly an infant. In my baby book, at the 18 month mark, my mom wrote that it was my favorite thing. I had Lion King everything, and spent my childhood studying lions as they were my favorite animal. I have shared the animated movie with my own children, and we've enjoyed every other real life remake of other Disney movies. When I found out this was coming out, I was apprehensive, but excited. I didn't want them to ""ruin"" it, but trusted the studio and Faveau - I thought Jungle Book was excellent and knew he could pull this off as well. And he did! The quotes and songs that were important were there, and they added lots of other fun quips as well. I was nervous for the voice acting because the reviews rip it to shreds but surprise! It was fine as well. The animals were so lifelike and I appreciated the authenticity of their design. I was nervous to see how songs were handled because of course they can't be entirely accurate to the animated version, but yet they did what they could and still go their point across. The magic of the movie was not lost, and I loved sharing this with my family. We all laughed, we all cried, and we will all enjoy both versions for years to come. My biggest complaint is that I did miss Jeremy Irons as Scar, but Ejiofor still did a great job and brought new personality to the character. I am totally pleased with the renewing of my favorite movie for 24 years, and look forward to more retellings of my favorite stories.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Not very emotional and a little too predictable, but still fun","It's unbelievable how realistic the animals and scenery appear, it's hard to believe that it's animated and not filmed. I remember as a kid being astonished by the animation of the original film, but that was nothing compared to this. It's a shame that the realism made it so that the animals couldn't really show any emotion. I guess ""real"" looking animals and emotional stories just don't mix. The makers undoubtedly could've given the animals emotional expressions if they had chosen to. But when you stop and think about it, it is ""understandable"" why they didn't. I'm not necessarily saying that it was the right decision, but since the animals look real (as opposed to hand drawn artwork), it probably would've looked a little weird if they had showed emotions, since most real animals do not.The voice acting wasn't very good. I never thought there was anything special about the voices in the original film, but they were better than most of these. It also seemed a little weird that so many of the lines were pretty much identical to the original, this undoubtedly makes the new voices seem even worse for those of us who remember the way they sounded before. I really think they should've rewritten most of the lines and made more new events. The movie does have some new scenes, I liked the scene where Nala flees the land, this was a nice addition. But most of the scenes are pretty much the same as the original. It also became a bit boring at times. I think it would've been better if they had made more additions and changes, and perhaps some new songs.I think it's really neat when animated movies are remade in live action form (or seemingly live action form in this case). But what worked in one form doesn't always work in the other.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Utterly pointless remake.,"This new version (I refuse to refer to it as live-action) brings absolutely no originality to this story.The original was the Disney masterpiece of the last 30 years, this most certainly isn't.Jon Farveau did a magnificent job with The Jungle Book, but at least he was willing to shake things up with that.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Such a shame,"The new Lion King has a few moments of genius and the best animal animation that I've ever seen. But it is let down by pacing mistakes and sub par orchestration.The images in this movie are so gorgeous and the animal behavior (especially the facial expressions in the lions) so realistic, I hugely enjoyed the movie despite flaws that I feel could have been relatively easily avoided. It seems that this was a work of love for the animators but somehow the whole was off. Great to hear James Earl Jones again. Pumbaa and Timon were great. I loved the new Simba's hair scene. But why rush over the love scene and some other buildup moments that made the original so great.I also feel that Hans Zimmer missed the mark on the score. I find it wonderous how he succeeds in making an orchestra sound like a collection of electronic instruments. It's not super bad necessarily, but it doesn't match the original in warmth and depth. This soundtrack is nowhere near as good as some of Zimmer's other scores.Such a shame. The first-rate (did I say: awesome?) animation and some moments of wonder made this an above-average 8 for me. But with more love this could have so easily become a 9 or 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

This is a one and done deal.,"I'm going to be honest. I was hyped for the movie. The movie is decent, but I understand why the initial reviews were heavily toward the negative side. I liked the overall direction Jon Favreau went with the movie. He mostly kept the story faithful to the original. However, the movie just didn't have the heart. I think this is just a one and done deal. Watch it for the visuals because the CGI is amazing. People are saying it's a shot for shot remake, but that's fake news. The scenes are basically the same with some different camera angles and animated movement (with a few new additional scenes here and there.)*SPOILER*The main reason why I'm giving this a 6 star rating is because some of the voice actors did not work. Donald Glover is just sitting there reading lines like it's just another paycheck. Beyonce completely butchered ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight,"" by over-complicating the song with runs and pitch changing. Every line went like, ""can you feel the love toniyiyiyiyight."" The song is supposed to be simple and the duet partner should be able to harmonize throughout, but that never happened. It has been confirmed that both Beyonce and Donald Glover were in separate booths at different times/area when they recorded the song. So, it just sounds like Beyonce is trying to one-up him, which completely ruins the atmosphere. I didn't feel anything... Sorry, that's just the truth. What worked well, however, was Scar. Chiewetel Ejiofor did an outstanding job playing the voice for Scar in this rendition.Pros: James Earl Jones, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Hans Zimmer, Elton John, Lebo.

I think that's just a way to earn money using things that the audience already know, love and often associate to his childhood. But the enormous production behind this works (we are still talking about Disney) makes the movie interesting for the eyes.

"Great film, but Beyonce is a no from me","The Lion King is a story we all know and love, most of us grew up watching the classic animated version, but for the new generation being born it seems Disney want to retell these stories and reach a new audience.We know how the story goes, so there's no real spoilers going into this film. We go to relive a childhood film and see it's transformation into a computerised real life film.
Nothing in this film was real, even the trees, but it all looked so real and impressive.As the film starts and you hear the start of Circle of Life you should get that instant body chill, but this version just wasn't as powerful as the original. It left me unsatisfied, and to think this is only the beginning of the film where it needs to live up to expectation.This film publicity circled SO MUCH around Beyonce to hype fans up for the Beyhive fans. I like her as an artist, but personally I feel as though her voice for Nala was a terrible choice. There was just no emotion in her voice and seemed to always be one tone. I'm sure there would've been a better choice than Beyonce but I understand they locked in a huge pop artist to promote a film and bring in some coin.Overall I really enjoyed the film, the graphics were impressive and so real life looking, but it was the music and Beyonce that let it down for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Honestly, I don't see why they even bothered hiring new actors to do the voices when Disney could have used exactly the same audio and simply reanimated it.The only new approach that this version brings to the table is more realistic special effects. I worry that a future generation of children will not ever bother watching the original Lion King because they'll say things like ""Why bother? The 2019 one is the same, but it looks better."" Next up we might as well do 3-D digital reproductions of Picasso that look sleeker than his old oil painted originals.Also when you create animation of animals that looks that real and yet they're talking and singing and dancing it produced an effect that I found a bit unsettling.

But it's been years since I last watched it-I was feeling a bit saturated, I'm not sure.I had heard a lot of negative reviews about this movie, and that partly delayed me from watching it.Today, I finally watched it, and I enjoyed it a lot.Visually spectacular, though it's true that sometimes the voices seem to go at a pace that doesn't quite match the animals supposedly speaking, but that only happened two or three times throughout the film.I loved how they adapted many scenes, refined others, and corrected some flaws that I always felt the original story had, without falling into the trap of trying to please everyone, as often happens with movies these days.In the end, the adaptation felt respectful, well-made, visually stunning, and also I can say that musically nothing took me out of the experience.I really enjoyed it, so I can't give it a bad rating.I highly recommend it.I still think The Jungle Book is superior, but this movie is very good.

You would have thought that after Aladdin they would have learned that scene by scene copies don't work! You need originality cause otherwise you try to beat a masterpiece, and that's damn hard! No wonder Mulan chose to cut the songs and mushu, they want to create something that can stand on its own. Overall I was heavily Disappointed.

"About what you would expect, but not amazing.","Like i said in the title its about what you would expect from the Lion King, its enjoyable but it just falls flat for some reason, especially the beginning. It picks up in the middle and ends well. The voice overs are just ok. Its a good movie, just not great and doesnt beat the original animation in my opinion. The special effects and CGI are second to none, the songs are great but for some reason i was left feeling empty, it has no heart, i feel its down to the voice acting, especially young simba.

Decent remake,This movie in my opinion doesn't beat the original. But you cannot sent the technical brilliance of this movie. From the animals and the backgrounds and the settings everything looks beautiful. It looks realistic is what I'm saying. And all the vocal performances were really solid. James Earl Jones once again is a beacon of hope as Mufasa and I really loved him. And Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner as Pumba and Timon were really good as well. I even liked Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar even though he is no Jeremey Irons. Although this film feels like a repeat of the original with a few parts added in there. But is just feels the same.

Simply Breathtaking!!,"First of all I want to say that the original ""Lion King""is one of the greatest achievements by Disney in all their history of classic cartoons.So with that out of the way and saying I do understand why the comparisons are made ...this movie deserves a review on its own and that's why I am giving it just that.....this movie is simply breathtaking and an amazing achievement in live action movies. It looks amazing and if there are few directors who wants to stay close to the source material, it's Jon Favreau ,because he really wants to make sure his movie does justice to the original and oh boy does it do that....forget all the bad reviews,this movie is a masterpiece in cinematic history....it looks amazing ,sounds amazing and yes the characterization of the original movie can never be topped this is still a beautiful landmark in filmmaking.Everyone who loves the original should watch this open minded ....because classic cartoons hold a special place in our hearts , doesn't mean their live action counterparts don't do it justice. Yes certain movies make a mess of it but the Lion King 2019 live action remake of the original movie is a King among live action remakes .......everyone should watch this ..... it's beautiful 10/10 for me......",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Slimy, yet satisfying, with none of the Disney magic!!","Visually this movie is phenomenal and realistic, it felt like you were watching and experiencing a true live action remake which felt like you were watching an episode of LIFE. Unfortunately what it made up for in visuals, lacked it almost every other way. There are key moments from the original that I felt spoke to me the most were omitted from this remake. It felt as though the actors were just saying their lines and didn't show the emotion or soul that viewers were owed. For the most part there weren't anyone that stuck out. James Earl Jones has always been the standout with his voice still being as powerful. I think casting was a bit of an issue. I think Donald Glover would have been more suited for young Simba and probably would have killed it. Timone ane Pumba started to grow on me the more the movie went on, but there's no replacing Nathan Lane. John Oliver came across as annoying sometimes as Zazu. I didn't feel the soul in Rafiki for most of his part. The beginning was a tad disappointing, I couldn't wait for young Simba to grow up, middle was very good and the ending was just okay. And the songs just didn't really do it for me. Spirit wasn't really put in the right part of the movie. The songs that weren't sung by the actors still held true to the original and Hans Zimmer did his thing.In my honest opinion if this was a shot for shot remake of the original it would have been a slam dunk but it get more like a cash grab. I think it was better than Aladdin, but maybe if they took Mulan's approach it could have been a different movie entirely.Visuals: 10/10

Too realistic,"The 2019 Lion King is a great movie that we've all already seen but the way the story is told is more limited than the animation.
The remake is more down to earth but it misses the simple fact that animals don't talk. The director mistakes at making a ultrarealistic ""live action"" when is not the best way to tell that story.
The result is that the real animals and their species are more limited at expressing emotions and movements and the colorful cartoony musicals and scenarios that existed in the animation are now gone.

Film Review: The Lion King (2019),"The Lion King.... oof. The Lion King original was fantastic, a musical that had decent music, animation that was outstanding, drama, betrayal, romance and the greatest characters Disney have ever made! But the new Lion King is a word for word remake, different actors making the acting worse, CGI making it feel like we are in a computer (which is good) and the same action as the original. It's just that the original was so perfect that nobody wanted this to happen. But it was okay. If you have seen the original Lion King you know the action that is about to go down, and you are just waiting for the CGI. But those who haven't are waiting for a brand new story.

"A true Lion King fan, grew up watching, negating bad reviews","I grew up watching & loving the original Lion King, even creating sing & dance performances as a child at daycare, so pls understand me when I say I LOVE the original cartoon!! After watching this & reading through many reviews, what bothers me most is reviewers saying it ""falls flat with no emotion"" or ""is like an Animal Planet documentary"", or ""comedic moments ruined with slower speech & articulation"". My response to these is...of COURSE it appears this way!! The realistic depiction of real animals is naturally going to deprive any human emotions in facial expressions that the cartoon film displayed, because real animals don't show human emotion as humans do!! Basic common sense in animal depictions being truly realistic...yes it seems to fall ""flat"" should you base upon this, any Disney film would...but to be quite honest, I found the realism quite believable when comparing to the animals depicted by behavior, character, and AGAIN, the cartoon was created showing animals with HUMAN emotion so kids could relate and understand!! Back in that era, however, the closest to live-action we as children were Pixel's Toy Story or straight live-action (remake) films like Hook (not Disney directly) that had no digital imagery whatsoever. Bottom line, yes when the digital animals are created with the voices, emotional expression is limited as they're made to be more life-like (how many lions or birds do you see at the zoo showing human expressions??), and I do agree that many comedic one-liners from the original were not included, but I honestly think this was much less ""humanized"" and more realistic...less relatable for children??

This remake is just another remake. I've been reading all the reviews I could and come to my conclusion that Dumbo(2019) was better.

New Standard for Visuals,"Lion King is for many, and for a good reason, an all time classic and favorite Disney wonder. The original movie had plenty of great dialogue, humor, and most of all Disney spirit that turned it into the timeless master piece it is today.The new rendition, however, does not exactly live up to the original in terms of these very elements. The humor, dialogue and the relationship between curtain characters is not being put forward with the same strength. This is arguably due to the photo-realistic scenery throughout the entire movie.Disney have namely on the visual side set a new standard for animation quality and realism. It is remarkable that any studio are able to produce these kinds of real-life-looking animations. Disney has clearly spend a lot of resources on producing this stunning visual treat, which is clear in every single frame. The photo-realistic approach, however, limits the cartoon-feeling of several characters and therefore limits the expression of emissions in several key scenes. The dialogue also seems to have been impacted by these limitations.Do yourself a favor and watch this on the biggest screen possible, for you to notice the level of details that has been put into the visuels in this film.What the new Lion King in some places lack in Disney spirit, it defiantly has in remarkable visual scenery and characters.

These characters don't laugh or show many facial emotions, of course, they are realistic animals.This movie is geared towards an adult audience who has probably seen the original and wants to see what it's possible with the latest technology.

"I cried out of nostalgia, not because of the movie.","So let me start off by saying that the 1994 Lion King is my favorite movie of all time. I walked into this movie with high expectations but also the understanding that it probably would not live up to them and the greatness of the original. Now to the review...I can imagine that trying to bring a full animal animation cast to life is no easy feat especially for a movie that every millennial could probably recite by heart. Visually, The Lion King was stunning. The team simply outdid themselves with the effects. It was truly bringing the classic story to life scene-for-scene. The characters who looked different were clearly more accurate to their real-life counterparts, which hopefully brings our youth closer to appreciating the animal kingdom's natural beauty, even if it doesn't have the flashing lights and colors of typical animation.Speaking of characters, here's where my gripes begin. While the casting for Simba, Mufasa, Pumba, and many other characters was very well selected, there were some notable exceptions. Zazu and Rafiki, while technically supporting roles, had no soul. Whether that was bad casting, not being able to grasp emotion through the CGI animation, or poor writing, these very colorful personalities were black and white here. While it pains me to say it, the movie might have been improved by removing them altogether.While Beyonce's voice is husky enough to represent Nala's speaking role, she doesn't bring the youth factor. It was apparent that her voice was too mature for a young adult role, especially when she's across from Donald Glover's perfectly cast role of Simba. Ok, ok, but she's a music personality. How was her singing? Meh. I felt that Can You Feel the Love Tonight started off beautifully, then progressed into THE BEYONCE SHOW! Honestly, I could hardly hear the instrumentals or Donald Glover, and just had Beyonce powerhouse riffing her way to the climax of the song. Oh, and Spirit would have been a better credits song. While casting Beyonce probably helped bring more Bey-hive supporters to the theater, it was a bad choice for filling the shoes of the OG Nala.The movie took out a lot of witty banter from Scar with the hyenas and even Rafiki with Simba that I felt spoiled the characters and the end product. There is no quirkiness, joking, or sarcasm, but rather a forced dialogue to get to the end. While I was impressed with the rolling thunder of Mufasa's arrival, it left something lacking as we simply didn't feel the powerful connection between father and son. Honestly, just keeping with the original script of Mufasa's advice here would have done wonders for this moment. I wouldn't have minded them going for a less life-like animation to get the goosebump inducing end result that came from the original ""Remember"" scene.Bringing Hans Zimmer and Lebo onto the music again was by far the best decision they made (besides the irreplaceable James Earl Jones, of course.) While they had the same instrumental songs, they also added numbers like ""Rafiki's Fireflies"" that just meshed beautifully with the rest of the soundtrack. You would have thought they were part of the original.Overall, while there were deep feelings of nostalgia, I didn't get chills as often as I expected to. In fact, I went home and rewatched the original version to bring back the good vibes. Oh well, hakuna matata!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Better nature documentary than worthwhile remake,"The Lion King (2019) is a stunning visual achievement, but unfortunately that's about the only achievement of this wholly unnecessary remake. It stays very close to the original, which is both good and bad. It feels at times like they're just waiting to hit all the notes audiences expect without supplying the raw emotion the original brought. Part of this is because hand drawn animation allows more emotional expressivity than CGI. Beyoncé can no doubt sing, however her casting here feels off. Rogen and Eichner are the only ones who seemed perfectly cast and expertly stay true to their characters while adding some new material. Ultimately, The Lion King remake is a sight to behold and nostalgia-inducing, but fails to justify its own existence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

It has it's own magic. The incredible effort put into the graphics was not lost on me, the animators didn't get a hair or blade of grass out of place.

Unlike the previous remakes (Dumbo, Aladdin) where there are new or changed scenes.
Now those scenes did not necessarily improve the film but they tried to make it somewhat different.The Lion King (2019) is an exact copy of the animation film. With amazing looking visuals that is. If they did not butchered the amazing ""be prepared"" song it would also be an extra star.
The difference in all the songs is that these feel, by a lack of better words, very ""Album/studio recorded"", they miss a kind of playfulness that was in the originals. Also Beyonce's
vibrato-voice does not do the song ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" much good.To sum things up:

I liked Donald Glover as Simba a lot actually, and Seth Rogan as Pumbaa wasn't really here nor there, didn't hate it but didn't love it either. Even James Earl Jones didnt perform very well, and he was the orginal Mufasa. A lot of the lines from the original felt like they were thrown in there in a spot that made them sound forced and just not right to me. I ended up leaving when I saw they took out Simba and Rafiki's talk...you know, the one that makes him go back to pride rock while simultaneously teaching him he shouldn't run from his past but learn from it instead.

"The level of technology we have reached is insane, the movie is astonishing real","One will argue what was the point of doing a remake that is almost bit for bit what the original movie was. And this is a fair point. But I'll talk about it later.
First I have to talk about the movies' positives. It's insane. The photo realistic animals are almost flawless, if they didn't talk, you could think you were watching an Animal Planet show or something. It's that level of perfection. And even the talking part, I think they handled pretty well, it doesn't feel strange. The voice acting is awesome too. Mainly Seth Rogen as Pumbaa steeled the movie for me.Well, and I think that's it as far as positives go. Of course, you will watch it, be amazed by the technology, and also entertained by the story, cause it's the original Lion King's story. But I understand the ones who asked for more in a remake as big as this one.The Lion King is a difficult property to reboot, knowing how well received the first movie was and still is, it's really difficult to think about a way to re-telling the story while still doing something new without pissing fans off. But when you have that much money and minds behind it, you have to do it. The technology is awesome, and this will certainly be remembered as a turning point in animation history decades from now. But still, I believe you needed more to justify rebooting such an important franchise.The story is almost bit for bit the same, there are 3 or 4 new scenes, that don't add nothing new to it, it's just to get to the 2 hours run time. The photo realism is amazing, but it can also be viewed as a problem, because of that realism the characters show very little emotion (I mean, it's hard to make a Lion show human-like emotions), I also found that because of realism as well, it was really hard to distinguish between some characters, namely the lionesses, when they weren't talking I had basically no idea if it was Nala or Simba's mother. Those are some of the two points I believe the original one beats this one quite easily.To sum up, the movie is entertaining, and it's for sure a turning point in movie technology, as Star Wars or Avatar were before it. It's historical. However, in the end, the question that remains is if we really needed this turning point to be in a Lion King re-imagination, that isn't really a re-imagination.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Unfortunately, all the emotions I was feeling, came from the features that were already present in the previous film. The film brings nothing new to their film and tries to be as similar to the original as possible. This is not necessarily wrong, since its a remake, audiences criticize filmmakers when they change things up from their childhood films. But it seems like when I watched this movie, everything I was loving about it, was not creatively made by them.
The score, for example, is beautiful and toys with my emotions the most, but was originally produced for the original film. This does not mean that I believe that they should've developed their own totally new soundtrack, but it's not like I can applaud John Favreau and his team for this either.
Favreau did an absolute amazing job with making sure his film had the top-notch CGI and I can applaud him on THIS. All I can say is that it was well-crafted, but has nothing new brought out except its CGI.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

"While nothing is new in this remake, the visuals are worth seeing","If you've been thinking about watching the Lion king again, by all means go see this, cause it's the same shot for shot remake as the original, with some minor to larger things removed. That's really the only negative thing I have to say about this movie, is that it's the same story. The visuals are Damn good, and sometimes left me with my jaw dropped at how beautiful some scenes looked. I recommend people to see this if they want to see beautiful visuals.

I also did not like how the animals were designed, the target market for this movie are children so why not make some animals cute and child friendly.

Alright Computerized Live Action Remake Film,This is a fine computerized live action remake film for all viewers to watch. The crew did a good enough job in creating this film. This film version did a great job in following the storyline and adding some extra bits into it. The cast selection was alright but could have been better. They did not exactly fit with their character roles. They really committed to the storyline. The chemistry between the cast members needed some improvement.

Better than I thought,"Although I see this remake as an unnecessary move and had plenty of prejudgement about how good it can be, it actually was good enough. It's nothing like the animation one obviously but in its on way, it's enjoyable. I didn't find it boring at all even though most of the comments said so and most importantly, it was worth watching it at the theatre. All of the bad reputation it draws is mainly because of how bad the other live-action remakes were, so don't let it affect your opinion.Some parts are directly taken from the animation, some parts are changed; voice acting is better than I expected, camera work and CGI is incredible and together they form an enjoyable movie.Criticizements towards the emotions in the movie are mainly accurate as some scenes are emotion-wise less appealing but after all, these are animals talking and it's actually a live-action movie. There's no reason to expect the same mimics and same emotional scenes like there was in the animation version. And it's not like every scene lacks emotion or anything.Generally speaking, it was better than I expected. I won't recommend it as a must-watch movie but if you do it, you won't really regret it assuming you don't have any negative bias towards it.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

I was genuinely very impressed. The music was reasonable although cant say it made it better or worse in my opinion.

Sadly in this remake some moments were modified for worse and the film's script felt choppy.Interactions between the characters feel slightly robotic at times, the voice actors could have been better. Seth Rogan was the best part.The script is simplified at times and parts of the original movie are watered down.The father clouds scene was a major let down.

Stunning to watch but that's all,"I really wanted to love this film, from the moment it was announced I have been so excited to see it, counting down the days.But it was a massive let down. Visually it's absolutely incredible, the art/vfx team did a fantastic job. But the script and direction was terrible. They butchered the first two big musical numbers and the extra dialogue gave unnecessary exposition.There are some parts of the dialogue that don't even make sense with how it's been shot now, like scars opening lines. And scars delivery overall changed the whole personality of the characters for the worse, same goes for rafiki.There are so many classic lines from the original that even to this day I recite with friends for a laugh, but these have all been destroyed and replace with very forgettable dialogue delivery.Overall, there were about 4 moments that I thought they did a great job with, but was frustrated and even bored throughout the rest of the film. I'm not even worried that it was almost a shot for shot replica, I actually wish that they kept it closer because everything new, had a negative effect on the story.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

I came out of the movie feeling something i lacking, it was the HEART of the movie.

The emotion of animals,"First of all, this film is stunning. There's no denying that. While people hate remakes, I fully appreciate the efforts to utilize technology that did not exist at the originals release. The detail is really something to marvel at.I see a lot of complaints about ""lack of emotion"" and I completely disagree. There are no exaggerated emotions, or human emotions. But there are subtleties and inflections and I think it's important for children and people in general to understand animals emotions range high and low and many take it for granted because they cannot express it in ways we always understand. An animal does not need to cry for us to know it's suffering, nor smile to know it feels joy. There was enough for me to feel the emotions there, and I loved that they were not overly animated (I realize this sounds too deep for a movie with a singing pig, but still.)That being said, it was a beautiful take on the original. I loved the original to death. The changes I saw were small but pretty enjoyable. It wasn't overly animated. Scar and the hyenas felt more menacing, and the action felt very intense. Eichner and Rogen's improv cracked me up. I actually felt giddy over the cubs and little Timon cause they were just so darn cute (the meerkat behaviors were spot on). Beyoncé sung with Glover beautifully, but her single that came out of nowhere ruined the pacing. It felt jammed in there, totally unnecessary; sorry Bey.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Why the bad reviews? People are critical to a fault!,"If you were a original fan of the animated Disney film, you will love this film. It's virtually the same film, scene by scene, shot upon shot. Obviously has a different voice cast, but they hold their own. There were some lines that I found a bit forced and cheesy at times but remember, this is a CHILDREN'S film. It is a new take, on an old classic. I'm 30 years old and I was so excited to see the new take on the movie even if that meant the same story, same scenes, just done in a different format. That's exactly what they did. Some scenes differ the slightest bit from my childhood favorite, but almost every single scene is the same. Same dialogue, same everything. If you give this movie negative reviews, you don't like the original. IT'S THE SAME MOVIE. Growing up, The Lion King was a favorite. This movie has so much nostalgia, and it's done in a beautiful way. If you can remember being a child, and crying,laughing,and just straight up enjoying the original, do yourself a favor and see this movie. Ignore the negative reviews. I read them all before viewing it, and I strongly disagree with everyone. People are way to critical nowadays. Like I said and I'll leave it with this. If you were a child growing up in the 90's, and the Lion King was one of your favorites, you NEED to see this movie. Do yourself that justice.

Stunning CGI with nothing new to add,"No one can deny the beauty of the artistic work that the CGI team has created, but it seriously added nothing new to the movie. Some additional scenes that serves nothing but extra time.
Scar's song, Be Prepared had good voice acting but nothing visually interesting. The animals super realistic which means they showed no emotions in their faces.
Timon and Pumbaa stole the show for me, but still there was something missing. Timon was not always in control like in the original.If you want to watch it to see the new CGI skin on an old beloved movie, with some of the songs shortened, then go ahead, you'll have a great time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Totally recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Still an amazing movie, however with a major flaw in Beyonce voice acting","First off, as many have mentioned before me, the CGI is amazing! I think the plot was very well done - still the same story with a few tweaks and while some may argue the tweaks were for better or worse I don't think it changed the movie which is still amazing.
The thing keeping me from giving this is a 9 or 10 is honestly Beyonce - I think her voice acting was so misplaced in this movie. It was horrific to the point where I couldn't stop thinking about it whenever Nala opened her mouth.
Another detail I personally would have enjoyed is if the characters kept some of the ""Disney"" tune to them - for instance scar keeping his bordeaux/black color and the other lions a more ""unrealistic"" color to keep some of the Disney factor in there. However, I realize this might just a personal opinion and has not affected this review.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Visual feast, dumbed down dialogue and zero heart","As expected, the movie opens with possibly, IMO, the greatest opening scene EVER in the history of movies. The song, the scale, it's all pretty close to the original, even if one or two notes are deliberately sung differently.Visually, the movie looks great. I wouldn't go as far to say it looks incredible, but it does look pretty good. But that's about it. Like so many people, I have seen the original so many times, I can almost recite every line word for word. And that's where the problem starts. A lot of the wisecracks and humor has been discarded with, for no apparent reason.So many of my favourite one-liners and jokes have been replaced with bland, instantly forgettable lines. Beyonce just overdoes all her lines, and the new song they slotted in, Spirit, was just flat and pointless, even in its two minutes of existence.For anyone who hasn't seen the original (and I realised there were actually quite a few of those in the audience with me), it might just be an average movie. For those of us who grew up with it over the past 25 years, it is a disappointing, flat, soul-less money grab by Disney and they should be ashamed of it. But of course, they aren't. It's all about the money, and not the heart, even though that's what Disney used to claim all those years back.The recent Jungle Book, which came out a couple of years ago, was much better than this movie in every aspect. Such a sad indication of what Disney has become.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Still as impressive as the original,"As soon as I heard that there would be a live action version of The Lion King I was extremely hyped. After the movie's release I saw a lot of bad reviews, which made me worried to be honest. Luckily, those reviews couldn't be further from the truth.The Lion King 2019 delivers a breathtaking visual spectacle with a lot of respect for the 1994 original. There were a few changes, some for the worse, some for the better.
Contrary to what many people were saying, the animals aren't lifeless at all. You could see all of their emotions in their eyes and bodily movements, of course sometimes more than at other times.Despite having seen the original 20+ times at least, I found myself completely caught up in the story once more. The music too was again stunning (thanks Hans Zimmer!). I already found myself crying two seconds into the movie. That's how beautiful it was.The only thing I really disliked, was Beyoncé. Her voice acting is flat and dull, robotic even. She oversings everything (imo she ruined 'Can you feel the love tonight'). And her singing 'Spirit' was especially annoying, it felt completely out of place. But I'm not a fan of her in general, so I might be biased. Her influence is only minor.Go see it, it's absolutely worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
I think most people miss the point,Disney isn't cash grabbing with remakes.. they made a statement that they will remake their movies every ten years for the next generation.. so many hater me complaining it's the same movie.. don't see the complaints about Aladdin or Dumbo..

people are comparing this to the original,"The new movie has some good features and some drawbacks of those. Yes it looks beatiful and so realistic. But with those realistic animal faces it is so hard to show the emotions on them. Besides that i think there were only 3 characters whom sounds were well fitting. Pumbaa, timon and scar. Billy Eicher did a really good job. You could feel that positivity in timon s voice. Anyway like i said before compared to the original, it is worse. But not a bad movie, it s worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
The Lion King (2019),"I think we all have seen The Lion King as a child. Whether you want to admit it or not, its a Disney classic. The songs and lines from the film are memorable and its up there with Disney animated ventures from their best decade. I question the need for every Disney live action film coming out but I've been surprised. Lion King was a strange case. Its got a great voice cast for sure but it looks like a feature length National Geographic documentary. I heard bad things about this going in. I'd say its decent. It follows the original work very, very, closely and I think it takes a lot of the if it ain't broke don't fix it philosophy.The film takes place in the animal kingdom, where the king lion Mufasa has recently had a son named Simba. This young cub is destined to be the new leader at the behest of his scheming and jealous uncle Scar. Simba quickly learns the dangers of being next in line for the throne and then has to learn how to grow up and be a leader to his kingdom. The film interestingly brought back James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa. The film has a lot of voice talent like Donald Glover, Beyonce, and Seth Rogen.The visual and realistic nature of the animals is fairly amazing. The animals look so real and the recreation of the original animated features scenes is pretty remarkable. I thought visually its as good as can be. The film could have used some originality for sure but I wasn't so bothered with a remake that closely follows the source material. I haven't seen the animated version in a long time so recalling moments through a new film wasn't so bad. I felt some parts were very rushed though and not done as well as the original.The score and recreation of the classic songs was nice regardless. I know there will be a lot of complaining and it won't please everyone but I felt like it was a solid film and a good enough watch. Not very many complaints. I don't think it possesses all of the magic of the original but its still a faithful effort and I really mean you can see the effort there visually but maybe not so much so creatively. Pretty sure this will be a cash cow regardless for Disney as it was pretty hyped.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

"Technically proficient, visually stunning yet strangely soulless","I can see a LOT of effort went into this remake. Cutting edge technology and a talented voice cast, nice direction and a great sountrack. But unfortunately despite all this, I felt it didn't hold a candle to the 25 year old original.Part of the problem is that I felt it stuck too closely to the original rather than expand upon it. At times it was almost a scene for scene remake and that was a major issue as they were too similar. Sure, stick to the story of the original but at times this was incredibly predictable because it was so close. Even many of the gags and a lot of the dialogue was lifted ad verbatim from the original and I felt it took away from an otherwise impressive effort.The screenwriters should have added their own flourishes whilst keeping in some of the crowdpleasing moments from the 1994 version. Granted the film contains the great songs from the original, albeit it done in different styles, but i'm afraid I felt a little underwhelmed at times. As wonderful actor as Chiwetel Ejiofor is, I badly missed Jeremy Irons memorable turn as the voice of Scar complete with that menacing delivery, although at least Jon Favreau had the common sense to keep the wonderful James Earl Jones (now 88 years old!) as Mufasa to give it some of the class of the original. Some of the other recasting has been well done (John Oliver as Zazu for one captures the essence of the Rowan Atkinson turn on the original).I really wish I could have rated this higher but I can't but help compare it to the fabulous original and think this is a pale imitation that should have been allowed to take it's own path to bring something different t the table.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Visually Stunning, but that's about it","The 1994 Lion King is my childhood and one of my all time favorite. I've lost count of how many time I've watched it, and that's why I have really high expectation for this remake. And, frankly, it didn't disappoint.First, I would like to salute the people behind the beauty of this film. They did a really wonderful job here with the cgi. The visual is stunningly beautiful. Everything look so real, from the scenery to the animals. The talented people behind all these deserve all the praises they could get. With all that said, I have one problem with the cgi. Because they try to go for the realistic look, they end up losing the emotions of the characters. For example, I couldn't tell that Simba was sad or happy, which I think is really important for this film. The audiences need to be able to sympathize with the characters. I didn't feel as connected to the character as much as I had when I'd watched the animated version. Moreover, because the lions are supposed to look real, I sometimes find it hard to differentiate the characters.Moving on to the story, just like many people have said, the plot is exactly the same as the original. I can actually say that there's absolutely nothing new added to this movie at all. However, it didn't annoy me, since I know it's a remake and I was expecting that it will be the same story with more realistic looking animals.As for the casts, I think everyone did a good job. I know that many people doesn't like Chiwetel Ejiofor voicing Scar, but I personally don't think he's bad. Since this film supposes to portray realistic animals, I think having the voice of Scar from the animated version might make the film less serious. Although I love Jeremy Irons' Scar, I think I prefer this type of not so cartoonish evil Scar. And may I just say that I'm so glad that Mr.James Earl Jones reprised his role for this remake. He was truly a legend. I couldn't imagine anyone else as Mufasa.Truth be told, I can't say this film is flawless. It has quite a few flaw and it couldn't possibly beat the original. It lacks the emotion and soul the original has. Still, I think it's a pretty nice take on the Lion King, and I don't think that anyone can argue how stunning the visual is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Is it Zazu not being caged while singing about his lovely coconuts? I don't know how they made this movie 30 minutes longer but I feel robbed.

They stayed true to what visuals you would actually see in Africa.. the music remained the same, even the instrumental pieces, there are a few new desongs thrown in for good measure, and Beyoncé was a great choice. The cinematography (for movie geeks) was probably the best part of all.. there is so much attention to detail in the scenes, which I loved.. the voices and the voice actors were nowhere near as bad as people are saying. I thought they were just the right fit for their characters. Mufasa death scene still makes you cry too. There really isn't much to critique besides the acting ability of the voice actors, meaning they aren't as solid as the original.

Great looking yet boring and uninteresting,"Greetings from Lithuania.While i'm not the biggest fan of the original The Lion King because i was 33 when i first watched - yet even that one was way better then ""The Lion King"" (2019). It wasn't a bad movie because it looked amazing, but other then that and great voice acting by Seth Rogen this new version wasn't interesting and was kinda boring to be honest. Songs were pretty lame and uninspiring and the whole thing just felt poorly paced.Overall, i would recommend to watch the original for those haven't seen it over this one.

Lion King - Review,"If you love The Lion King, then you will most likely love this movie... well, because it's The Lion King. It's not necessarily a shot-for-shot remake, but it is very close. There isn't really anything in this movie that sets it apart from the original animated movie and a lot of people are going to be totally fine with that. As for someone who never was super connected to this movie as a kid, I needed this remake to add in some new stuff... something to give it its own identity. I didn't really get that with this movie like I did with the Aladdin, Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast remakes. Of course, the VFX are amazing and game-changing. The voice acting is great. Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner and John Oliver are total standouts.I like this movie... 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Great visual affects,"The computer visual affects are mind-blowing, if you didn't know any better you just might believe those animals were real on screen, the only downside for myself was that I was five years old when the original animated movie came out, for the amount of money I spent on tickets and popcorn for me and my wife to see this movie in my opinion it's not worth it when you're pretty much literally going to see the same movie with slight differences throughout almost the same as some of the voice actors from the original, but if you're into visual effects and that's what you enjoy amazing visual effects then don't miss the chance to see The Lion King on the big screen for comes out on DVD. But yeah good movie similar to the original decide slight differences",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Stop complaining about the facial expressions,"Yes, I agree that it wasn't exactly the same as the original, but people keep on forgetting that the purpose was to make the animals look as real as possible.

The animation still the king.,"Off course remade one of the best animations it's very risky but Disney is determined to do this., just for pure nostalgia, I decided to watch this, and I think that the real problem is because this new movie don't try change anything, so why do a remake if you just will be copy everything.. sure, had some tine differently things, but nothing that can change the story, said that, at least they did a amazing work wit the CGI, the photography's is wonderfull, and the new voices into the old musics are incredible sometimes better, and like always, Timon and Pumbaa are the funniest characters on the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Great movie!,This was actually really good. It has a different feel from the original but overall I liked it and I think the people posting bad reviews didn't actuallly watch it or are being overly critical. There were some changes made to the plot but I think it worked for this version. I think the original was better but this version was also pretty enjoyable in its own way. The imagery was beautiful and nothing like anything I've seen before. The voice acting was pretty solid and I think the actor who played scar did the best job. Music was different but well done.

Walked out,"Lion king is probably my favourite film and I have waited so long for this...... So disappointed. I wanted to walk out instantly but managed to struggle through to see the iconic Simba and Nala scene and 'can you feel the love tonight'...... Walked out as soon as it started. I have never walked out on a film but this was just too much. All Disney had to do was put the original vocals over the new effects and we would have a truly amazing film, but no instead they decide to spend all their efforts getting the effects perfect that the casting got zero thought.I would have given this a 0 rating if could, I will definitely be trying to forget this film ever happened and remember the Lion king for how it should be and not this disgrace.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Visually stunning; emotionally empty,"This film is a masterpiece of CGI, but otherwise falls flat in several areas. The voice acting is sub par, besides Timon, Pumba and Zazoo, and the musical numbers do not pack the same oomph of the original.Let's be honest here, we have to compare to the original as this is almost a shot for shot remake, and this is where the film once again falters. The problem with amazingly lifelike and anatomically correct animals is they don't show much emotion. This is a theme running through the film, the characters are flat, emotionless and just not as fun (once again besides Timon, Pumba and Zazoo). This gives the film a much darker tone, I felt.Also, whoever decided to not cast Jeremy Irons as scar again is a fool, as well the person who decided to change the song 'Be Prepared'.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

"Good movie, it's hard to live up to a classic animated movie","Oh how far the CGI has come. There are some scenes which you expect David Attenborough's narration to come through, ""Here in the deepest part of...""
The CGI is really spectacular on many of the eyes of the characters for example on Rafiki's baboon close up's those eyes are so detailed and expressive it was just incredible to see. Some of the lion's expressions were less so which was a bit of a let down. Felt as if they could have gone a bit more facially cognizant to present more feeling.
Once again, Pumbaa and Timon do some great scenes and just make you crack a smile. Glover was great, Beyonce did a good job but hearing James Earl Jones once more as Mufasa is the true deal.

Only major problem,"The only major problem in this movie - and the triumph of the original one - is that, when the director put everything in CGI and try to look like real animals, he just forgot that real animals have NO (or just a few) expressions of emotions.

Besides, this is CGI - one expects artistic license- not docu. In wild , all lions & cubs DO show emotions from crying, getting misty eyed, to joy, love, family bonding, fear & anger. EYES & eyebrows display expressions, incl whole body. They smile when content & happy.Here , Scar has freakish body, flat vocals. No one can beat J Irons ""Scar"" performance like most of the main characters.

There is no business like show business!,"""There is no business like show business"" to quote Irving Berlin is soundly befitting of these times in cinema. Fast cars, Toys that talk, Prehistoric animals are cash cows for production houses. Its taken 25 years, yes 25, for Disney's animation classic The Lion King to do a full circle and grace us with its re-invented presence. One might say, it is the ""Circle of Life"".25 Years later, from VCR to VR, The Lion King is a visual masterpiece. Director Jon Favreau (Jungle Book 2016) is leaving no rock unturned on this one. The recreation of the Savanna, Pride rock, Rafiki's Tree and those characters close to our hearts elicits nothing but awe and wonderment. The rising sun over the savanna and the opening soundtrack ""Circle of Life/Nants' Ingonyama"" and the immaculate attention to detail in the astute recreation of the 1994 megahit that remains the highest earning G-rated movie of all time is the pinnacle of the VR fueled marvel. Nails gripping the armrests and tear filled eyes awakens nostalgia of a childhood of a then 10-year-old. The bar is now set.Reprising the powerful role of the murdered King, James Earl Jones as Mufasa is joined at the helm of Pride Rock with Chiwetel Ejiofor(Scar), Donald Glover(Simba), Beyoncé(Nala), Billy Eichner(Timon), Seth Rogen(Pumbaa) and John Oliver(Zazu). If you were between the age of 6-10 in 1994, these characters are etched in your memory and Simba's adventure requires no synopsis. It is now safe to assume that a majority of any audience is viewing a re-make whilst the bubbly younger generation is witnessing Simba's story for the first time. Re-makes are always a risky business.""Timon and Pumbaa, you learn to love them"" is the infamous quote that should resonate in your mind if you have memorized the original as this reinvention lacks heart. Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner saves Simba in more ways than just one. Running approximately 30 minutes longer than the animation original, the duo keeps the story alive and buoyant and does absolute justice and fills in for the void left by the absence of Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. John Oliver is tasked with big shoes to fill and fill them he did not.Verdict: The visuals alone unquestionably justifies the remake. The soundtrack personifies heart. It is ""The Lion King"" how can you not love it?Enough Said. A Must Watch!Written by: Troy Manatunga. Title: The Lion King. Directed by: Jon Favreau.

THE BEST LIVE ACTION DISNEY!!!,This movie was amazing!!! I very looooveed one of bit by bit from this whole the movie 😘,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Middle of the Road,"I have to give the Walt Disney Company credit, with their Live Action remakes of their classic animated movies, they have developed a very lucrative profit stream with properties that they already own - and are well known to audiences. Some are successful (THE JUNGLE BOOK, ALADDIN), some are not quite so successful (DUMBO, ALICE IN WONDERLAND).And...somewhere in the middle...is the LION KING.Directed by Jon Favreau (THE JUNGLE BOOK, IRON MAN), this Lion King is a fairly faithful reproduction of the animated movie - and that is a blessing and a curse - and it, ultimately, keeps this remake squarely in the middle in terms of quality, interest and achievement.What works: the CGI animation of the animals and scenery. Favreau shot CGI-fest films like THE JUNGLE BOOK and IRON MAN, so he knows how to do these things and they work here in a very workmanlike way. The are all professionally done - there's not a bad shot in the film. But the ""wow"" moments are few and far between in this film as wellThe story is a timeless classic (kind of an ""animal adventure Hamlet"") and that works as do OME of the voice cast (more on that later)...and...of course...the songs - especially the faithful recreation of the CIRCLE OF LIFE opening - one of the best opening musical numbers in movie history.What doesn't work: The first 1/2 of the film's pacing. It drags pretty badly early on and the songs in that part of the film (like I CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING) just don't have the energy and pizzazz that is needed. And SOME of the voice work is just plain bland and boring and (in one case) I found irritating.So...let's talk about the voice cast. James Earl Jones (reprising Mufasa) is terrific (of course) as is John Oliver's Zazu (a much bigger presence in this film than the animated film), Chiwetel Ejiofor's Scar is appropriately menacing, if a bit bland, but ""good enough"" as is Beyonce's grown up Nala. I would have liked to see/feel a bit more of her ""presence"" in this character's voice, but that might be a Director choice and not an actress choice. John Kani's Rafiki is quite good as is the always steady/credible Alfre Woodward as Sarabi.What doesn't work is the two voice actors cast to play Simba. Donald Glover (TV's ATLANTA) is just too bland and boring as the adult Simba. He doesn't really bring anything interesting to his voice work of this character (but does hold his own in the musical duet ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" opposite the great Beyonce).I usually don't comment on child performances that I don't like (they are kids after all), so I won't really comment much on JD McCrary's voice performance as the young Simba except to say I didn't really how much MORE the young Simba is in this film as opposed to the older Simba - or at least it felt to me that the weakest voice performance in this film was on screen for far longer than I remembered from the animated film.As for the best voice performances in this film - that is easy - Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan's performance as Simba's pals Timon and Pumbaa. They had big shoes to fill in comparison to the voice work in the animated film from Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, so they did the smart thing - they didn't even try. Much like Will Smith not trying to imitate Robin Williams in the live action ALADDIN earlier this year (another voice performance that worked well) Eichner and Rogan make these characters their own and succeeded well - these two characters/performances are the high point in the film and bring much needed life and energy to a movie that was sagging under it's own weight by the time they show up.This Lion King will be THE Lion King for this generation - and that is ""fine"" - if the youngsters in my life want to watch this, I won't complain. But... I will try to steer them towards the much better animated version of this film from the 1990's.Letter Grade: a solid B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Mixed Feelings,"I've read the reviews. I've watched the film. I'll review this from both perspectives.Progressive view: The film is very true to the original. It could have been so much more. Nala could have given more speeches about misogyny, forced marriage, equality. We know lions are physically stronger than lionesses, but do we have to reflect reality? Nala should have been faster, stronger, smarter and featured much more than Simba. We should be educating our children that girls always come first. The male characters had WAY too much dialogue. Also, if Disney were serious, they wouldn't have human washed this film. They would have cast real lions and warthogs!Alternate view: This film is very true to the original. It's the first Disney movie in ages that hasn't pushed sexism onto our children. If you haven't seen the original, i'd recommend this version being superior because the cinematography is amazing and the story is almost identical. Some of the actors in this version are not as good (eg. Chiwetel as Scar was terrible as he was far too ""serious"" rather than devious and his singing was very poor. Timon and Pumba weren't funny. Shenzi was poorly acted: arrogant rather than sly and a scrounger like Whoopi Goldberg was in the original). But, the story maintained the heart and fondness from the original. If your children haven't seen the original, this one is worth watching.I found it enjoyable. Danny Glover was good (but the male singer in this version wasn't a patch on Jason Weaver from the original). This version doesn't stand in its own right, but it's an excellent remake. This film is politically correct free (meaning no sexism or racism). That alone makes is a cut above most modern Disney. Favreau should be commended for creating the most child friendly Disney movie since the Jungle Book remake.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

I went in with an open mind and tried to like it but as soon as I hear Scar I couldn't help but dislike it right away. I will say that even though I prefer the original Pumbaa Seth Rogan did a nice job with the part.

Be prepared! (For the worst film of 2019),"I hated pretty much everything about this film, but here are my main gripes.Firstly the way the animals were presented, their faces conveyed no emotion.

Why they messed with the songs is beyond me.The humour which underpinned the original is missing, and when they do attempt it, they miss. Badly. The dialogue was so wooden. Even though it was virtually the same lines we heard 25 years ago, they were delivered so badly.Most importantly, it felt like a cynical and greasy ploy to make money, and because it knew the title was enough to make says money, it didn't bother trying.It makes me so sad that a generation will grow up thinking this is the lion king.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

A beautiful but ultimately shallow adaptation.,"So I just saw The Lion King at the theater. Honestly after the disappointment that was Dumbo and the mediocrity that was Aladdin my expectations were pretty low. How could Disney possibly make anything that could live up to the iconic animated classic? Overall I have to say I enjoyed the film. Sure it wasn't perfect and it was a shameless cash grab, but I still had fun watching the movie and it is sure to please a new generation of viewers.Of course everyone knows the plot of The Lion King. It is one of the most iconic animated films of all time. Honestly very little is changed regarding the plot. Ninety-five per-cent of the film was a near shot-for-shot remake so don't expect anything original plot wise. The film hardly reinvented the wheel, but the original Lion King was a blatant copy of another film so that's not really a negative.Where the film really shined however was the CGI and set design. This may have bene one of the most incredible lookingDisney films I've ever seen. The CGI was rich and layered and really captured all of the diverse characters. On top of that, the setting was simply beautiful and wonderfully designed. In every way the film was pure eye candy and absolutely captured the beauty of The Lion King.I also have to mention the soundtrack. The original Lion King has so many incredible songs. I am happy to say the new cast really did a great job recording the classic songs. It was hard not to smile and burst out into song while at the theater. There really was not a bad performance song wise. The entire cast perfectly replicated the magic of the original songs in their entirety.The film had an absolutely phenomenal cast, but John Oliver and Seth Rogen really stole the show. I was skeptical about Seth Rogen but he perfectly captured Pumbaa and made the character his own. John Oliver was absolutely perfect and easily delivered some of the best lines of the film. Of course as expected Donald Glover and Beyonce were all around great and James Earl Jones was iconic as ever.That all being said the film was hardly perfect. With so much of the movie being a shot for shot remake the question has to be asked why even make the film? The new songs for the film were unmemorable and I was sad to see the film change a number of iconic scenes for no reason. The movie also toned down quite a bit of the comedy and whimsical factors that made the original so mesmerizing as a youth. While the CGI was beautiful the attempt to set the film in a realistic tone really hurt what made the original so special. The character design just seemed like it had a problem emoting with the line delivery.I also really had a problem Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar. His voice never really matched the character and the changes to the song Be Prepared definitely were a step backwards. The same can be said for the entire cast of a hyenas. Some of the delivery of the lines were also a bit questionable from the young actors playing Simba and Nala.Ultimately the biggest problem with the movie was not with the film itself but with just how iconic the original Lion King was. It would be near impossible for someone like myself who grew up on The Lion King to not unfavorably compare this to the animated film. That doesn't quite seem fair however to the film as a whole.This was easily the most entertaining and well-made adaptation Disney has produced so far. For a new generation I could easily see this becoming a classic. However for those of us who grew up singing Hakuna Matata this is sure to feel like shallow and unnecessary adaptation.

Rating: A,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I don't know how I should start, but I guess I'll address something that people might ask: yes, it's a SPOILER-FREE review. Why? Well, the story might follow the same essential plot points, and the characters might have similar narrative paths, but there are so many details that make this movie stand on its own. From tiny little improvements to moments of the original that wouldn't make sense in a realistic environment to adjustments to character's backstory, musical moments or other significant parts. With that said, I need to discuss the controversy surrounding this remake, but I won't take longer than one paragraph.People need to understand that these Disney's remakes aren't here to replace the originals. They're here to honor them, and bring their stories and characters to this new century so that new generations can have an additional look at something they love, and 90s kids can remember why they love these films so much. Emphasis on the ""additional"" part of that sentence. Then, people also need to get their preferences right: would you want to watch a shot-for-shot remake or something entirely different? Or a blend of these two? If you don't know what you want, you might be in danger of turning into a hypocrite if your speech goes from ""I don't want these copy-paste remakes"" to ""they changed that specific moment, why didn't they keep it the same?"" Just be clear on what you wish. If you simply don't want Disney to do these remakes, then just don't watch them. Don't go online try to beat it to the ground with negative comments if you haven't seen the movie. Moving on ...I love it. I absolutely love it. I cried the exact same 4 times as I did in the 1994's original. My whole body got chills during the opening sequence, which is one of a few things I love more about the remake than in the original. It's NOT a shot-for-shot remake! I don't understand how so many critics are calling it so. Either people's memory of the original faded or someone clearly didn't watch the same film. I can write a whole review of 1000+ words just describing the new stuff. Of course, the story goes through the same iconic moments in the same way, and some dialogues are extensively repeated, which was something that I was hoping they developed more. Despite that, I still feel that the scripts have a different take on it from the voice actors, even James Earl Jones.One proof would be that I cried on a scene that I never felt like it in the original. I don't know if it was how it was shot (one of the various different angles that the remake provides of known scenes) or if the dialogue just has more impact this time around, but the point here is that this remake is NOT a cheap copy-paste. I always look forward to seeing what they come up with to solve or adjust some questions that the originals leave us with. Let me just write that Jeff Nathanson has some truly brilliant changes/additions. Remember people criticizing Scar's look when the first teaser came out? With just ONE WORD, its entire physical shape, scar, and past are explained. One word. Imagine that. There are little elements like adding a word or a sentence here and there, and it makes so much more sense with the character or the story in question.Speaking of Scar, Chiwetel Ejiofor is astonishing. Scar might be my favorite character of the remake. He's more menacing and scarier, his voice is darker, and his arc is better explored. Jeremy Irons will always have that iconic voice associated with the character, but Ejiofor did a crazily good job in replacing him. However, if there's one voice that I could never watch another actor do is Mufasa's. I have no words to express how emotionally powerful James Earl Jones' voice is. As soon as he says ""Simba"" in the reflection scene, my eyes drop waterfalls. His voice is an emotional trigger, let's call it that. I love Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) even more this time around. Their scenes are hilarious, and the characters' relationship keeps being a standout. Oh, and if you were worried that the hula scene would never be as good let alone surpassed ... You might need to rethink that. Also, I enjoyed the stretched last act (I found the original's final battle too abrupt), and I would advise parents to be careful showing this remake to (very) young kids since the violence on display feels much more real (duh).JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright-Joseph (young Nala) are amazing, and their voices are crystal clear while singing. Donald Glover and Beyoncé (adult Nala) are also terrific, and their voices are even better. The new music Spirit fits better in this remake than Speechless in Aladdin. Moving on to the music, it's another aspect that I genuinely think the remake does better. Hans Zimmer proves that he can bring an old score of his back to life in a much more robust, epic, and passionate way. Every song feels more prominent, every soundtrack feels a lot more impactful and stronger. Be Prepared is the only one that goes through a significant change, and while it might sound a bit strange at first, I love it more each time I listen to it. It's a score that will never be forgotten, and this remake just helped people remember how great it is. Oscar-winning score.I left the best to last: the visuals. I can't possibly describe how impressive and eyegasmic the CGI is. Animals talking was never an issue (people keep sharing GIFs or short clips and immediately started complaining that it looked awkward ... a 30-seconds video without context watched on a laptop will never give you a hint of how the movie will actually be). Yes, the expressiveness of the original animation can't be achieved, but going as far as saying that the film lacks soul or that the characters don't emote is just inaccurate. You don't need a PhD to understand that a lion with its ears down or up means different things. There are tiny little movements in the animals that are so complex that I'm still astounded how they were able to do it. If a bug flies near their faces, they flinch or move in such a characteristic way that I felt like I was truly watching real animals. Once again, Oscar-winning VFX.I don't really have major problems with it. Minor gripes with a few things, but the biggest one would be the lack of more uniqueness. There's no element of surprise in regards to the story or the character's decisions. We always know what's coming, so we're prepared (no pun intended) for anything they through at us because, well, we've seen it before (with the exception of one particular scene that made me jump out of my chair and I think not a single person will be able to avoid it). I find the ""animals don't emote"" argument one of the biggest nitpicks in the history of cinema. It might be true that they lack the emotion of the original animation, but going as far as saying that they show absolutely no emotion is just hating for the sake of hate. Same goes for people criticizing the fact that Can You Feel the Love Tonight is sung during broad daylight ... In the original, it isn't nighttime as well.Finally, I just want to address the ""these remakes aren't necessary / no one asked for these"" discussion. No one asked for the 1994's movie until it came out. People didn't know they needed it. Seriously, everyone needs to realize that these remakes aren't here to replace the originals. How many of you have watched The Lion King (1994) or showed it to someone in the past 10 years? How many times have you heard its score in the same period? I bet that most of the answers are simply ""none"". That's how important this remake is then! It makes you go back, it makes everyone remember how incredible the 1994's film is, by keeping its essence while being able to stand on its own. Jon Favreau did a tremendous job, and I hope he gets recognized for it.In the end, it doesn't matter if the story is identical if we cry all the same. It doesn't matter if we know what's coming if we still feel nervous and worried about the characters. The Lion King (2019) is one of Disney's best remakes so far, on par with The Jungle Book. Its VFX are game-changing, its score is more powerful and emotional than in the original, and the story carries the same heartfelt impact. James Earl Jones' voice is everything. Timon and Pumbaa are even funnier. Ejiofor's Scar is the best character in this remake. I have no flaws to point out, except that it follows the exact same path that the original's story does. I wish it would be more distinct, but I can't lie to myself, I love it deeply. One of 2019's best movies. My #1 spot will be hard to decide... Go watch it! I can't wait to see it again!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Awesome visuals, not the same impact of the original.","The movie does a fabulous job to to tingle nostalgic emotions by giving similar visuals, but undelivers in conveying the same emotional impact of the 25 year old one. Most of the time, the characters seem to be empty shells unable to strike an emotional connect despite the ""superior"" graphics and visuals it incorporates. In spite of this it does, the movie provides a number of instances that causes goosebumps/ shivers down my spine and almost leading me to tears. Bring a remake, alterations to certain scenes provide a nice addition of humour that works well in the movie's favour. Hans Zimmer has given this movie an amazing carry with his OST, compensating for what the movie doesn't offer. It concludes, as we know, in a positive attitude and that really helps with the way you feel about the movie and the ""takeaway"".
The movie does an admirable job providing the generation that loved the original an opportunity to relive their childhood.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
The Lion King (2019) Review,"What a pathetic, unnecessary, crappy cash grab. Don't get me wrong, I love the original film a lot and I like Jon Faverou but both don't mix well together. Here are the few positives. Obviously the film looks visually impressive but that leads to some problems later. Most of the voice cast does a fine job. Especially Donald Glover, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, and John Oliver. That's where the positives end. Here are the negatives. This is essentially a shot for shot remake of the original film. There is almost nothing new except a new song which is played in the background and extended scenes of pointless scenery and a single piece of Simba's hair flying across the desert. I give some credit to the other live action remakes for at least trying to do something different, even if they didn't work but this film does almost nothing new at all. It played it safe which was the wrong direction. Some of the voice acting isn't great. James Earl Jones sounds like he wasn't even trying. It sounds like he recorded all of his lines in one take and then went home. Chiwetel Ejiofor makes Scar seem like a pathetic loser. He just fails to capture that spine tingling and energetic performance of Jeremy Irons. The songs besides Circle of Life and Can You Feel the Love Tonight just are underwhelming especially Be Prepared which for some reason was cut short. The musical score is fine but it feels like they just copy and pasted the score from the original instead of making new renditions of the score. Even if the CGI is impressive, it also serves to the film's detriment. You can't relate to the characters because the visual effects don't allow them to convey any emotion. An example would be Mufasa's death. The actor voicing young Simba does a good job conveying his grief with his voice but Simba literally has a blank stare on his face the entire time. This is a problem throughout the entire film. The animals express almost no emotions. That's the beauty of the animation style of the original. Because it was animated, the animators had free liberty to make the animals express in whatever way they wanted. Another problem would be that some of the more important moments are shorter in this film than the original. The stampede scene was about 5 minutes while in this one it feels shorter which is odd because the film is almost 30 minutes longer than the original. This all begs the question. What was the point of this film? Obviously money but there's no point to the film. It's just the same thing that is somehow almost 30 minutes longer. Overall, The Lion King is visually impressive but fails at recapturing the beauty, scope, and emotional weight of the original animated film. I give The Lion King (2019) a 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

"Entertaining, but won't watch again","This remake was OK. Understandably so, the CGI artists were limited by what they could do with animals and their faces. Since there was no easy way to convey emotion through facial expression, it had to fall of the vocal tonage of the actors, but sadly many of the scenes just felt emotionless and the voice acting didn't feel or look right at parts. It's just not a movie that works well with hyper-realism.The first half of the movie is pretty cringey as the voice actor for Simba did not do a good job of conveying emotion. He often stressed the wrong words which made for awkward transitions and made Simba seem like an entitled brat.The second half was completely saved by Seth Rogan. Thankfully. But even then, Beyoncé needed to CHILL with the riffing in the songs. The constant riffing felt like she was trying too hard and changing the songs to make them worse, not better. I get that that's her thing and she may feel creative freedom, but the songs were not composed to be sung with that style.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Now A lot of people loved the original Lion King, but I don't feel that if you love the original you'll love this one.
It's funny, I'll give it that. Seth Rogen and Billy Eincher as Tamon and Pumba are great. Keegan Micheal key and Eric Andre as the hyenas are fantastic!
Everything else...is noticeably not better that the original.
What I really feel weaken it for this adaption was the music. Same songs from the first movie where not poppin at all. I just can't wait to be king did not have the same flavor. The song that Scar( who was horrible in this film)sings lost something in its attempts to be more menacing.

If you liked the Original,"Over the past few years, Disney has begun remaking a number of their animated classics in hopes of reintroducing them to a whole new generation of viewers...or you know, to make more money off them. Probably the most anticipated of these was Jon Favreau's ""The Lion King"" (2019) which is finally in theaters. The movie has certainly generated a lot of buzz regarding photorealistic animation causing mass controversy online as to whether or not it's live-action, as well as whether or not that style should even be used. Regardless of how you feel about the animation, it's hard to not be impressed by it.
Another one of the big controversies surrounding the film is whether or not we needed it. The movie is basically a shot for shot remake of the original movie, with a few small changes to fit the new photorealistic aesthetic that the people at Disney worked so hard to create, so it's kind of hard to not enjoy the movie if you enjoyed the original seeing as it's more of a remaster than a full-blown remake. One of the biggest changes from the original movie and this might be considered a minor spoiler so spoiler warning ahead, is the addition of a subplot involving Scars motives. In this one, it seems Scar once had a desire to claim Sarabi as his queen, and envy's Mufasa for winning her over. It adds to his character, and I think helps understand him a little more. What makes this addition even more interesting is that it was supposed to be in the original but removed. While I like the idea of it, I felt that it was placed in the movie at the wrong time. The most prominent scene regarding Scar confronting Sarabi about being his queen comes after we see a fully grown Simba for the first time. While Scar and Sarabi may have discussed this before, the dialogue makes it seem as if this was the first time they had talked about it. Everything about the scene just feels off, and like it should have taken place a few weeks after Mufasa's death rather than what I can only imagine was at least two to three years. It's a small thing, but I don't understand how one of the few big changes from the original made such a trivial mistake. Outside of that though I did find the movie's plot to be just as entertaining as the originals.
When it comes to the new cast, I gotta say I think Disney did a great job of finding it's cast. Donald Glover is a pretty good choice for Simba, as he puts a lot of his heart into the role whether it's voice acting or singing one of the originals many classic songs. Beyonce as Nala is another great addition to the cast and possibly one of the very few improvements over the original, the only actual complaint I can come up with is that she easily overshadows Donald Glover during their duets but that's far from her fault. I was also pretty impressed by Chiwetel Ejiofor's take on Scar, as he managed to capture the chillingness that Jeremy Irons added to the character all while adding his own charm. I could go on about all of the new cast members because again I think Disney did a great job there, but perhaps my favorite cast wasn't a recast at all. When it comes to Mufasa there was no Replacing James Earl Jones, and I'm happy Disney realized it. The chemistry between the cast was honestly the movie's strongest point for me.
All things said and done, the new ""Lion King"" is nothing exceptionally new. Sure the photorealistic animation is impressive, but ""Avatar"" did it back in 2009, and even Jon Favreau's own ""Jungle Book"" in 2016. Not to mention, I felt that the photo-realism did take some of the heart out of the movie. I understand what they were going for, and it helps differentiate from the original, but truth be told I feel they should have met somewhere in the middle. I don't think it would have hurt the movie at all to make the lions look real, but keep the color schemes of the characters seen in the original. I feel this would have been particularly interesting to see in the final fight between Scar and Simba because you would know who is who. Again, it's a minor complaint against the movie and didn't overly affect my enjoyment of it, but it's worth noting. This is a very fun remaster of the original, and I more than enjoyed seeing it in theaters. I know a lot of people don't like the idea of it being a shot for shot remake, but I don't see an issue with it. If Broadway can bring back the same shows every now and then with a new cast and the latest advancements in theatre I see no reason films can't either, they're both performance-based art and it's interesting to see in my opinion. I just hope that it doesn't become an industry-standard rather a cool treat every now and then. Due to the fact though that it's nothing new, I don't think you need to see it in theaters. But it's worth seeing at some point if you liked the original. I'd give it a 7.5/10 as they took the Worry-Free Philosophy a little too far.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Missing the Soul of the Original,"Children will like this movie. Adults may have a hard time with it. Obviously the biggest downfall of this film was the fact that it didn't deviate enough from the original. Did the director truly believe that it was a good idea to make a carbon copy of the original? Apparently yes. Did Scar deliver a fine performance? The actor did okay, but the problem is the audience is accustomed to Scar's lines being delivered differently. Maybe if the director would have made a total different characterization of Scar, the movie would have been better. Why was Beyoncé in this film? Who knows. Her version of Nala contributed nothing to the story itself. Why was Donald Glover casted? Because he is black and hip. And I'm a black woman saying this. The voice actors' skin color did not matter! Lions are neither black or white. They are lions, which makes the decision to cast Beyoncé and Donald Glover even more frustrating! I don't see how any director can sacrifice great voice acting because of race (especially since the race isn't important to the story). Jeremy Irons should have been brought back. End of discussion.On another note, young Simba was fine until the death scene. The crying sounded a bit fake, but he was okay in the film despite this. Young Nala was excellent. Timon and Pumba are almost as good as the original actors. James Earl Jones is great too. The hyenas have some nice characterization as well.I will also say that the Afrocentric aspect was lost in this film despite the fact that the cast was mostly black. There weren't enough African drums and rhythms in this remake. Honestly, the original captured Africa better than the remake. I would have loved to see Ryan Coogler's interpretation of the Lion King instead of this lifeless Afrocentric interpretation. Overall, the original Lion King was gorgeous (despite the fact that it was plagiarism) and the remake is only impressive on a technical level.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Not Original,"I really have to rewatch the Original movie from the 90s. I remember I really liked it a lot. Having said that, for those who haven't seen that, they might be quite smitten by this effort. For those who hold it in high regard this might feel like an insult. As with many cases, the truth is somewhere in the middle.The animation or rather the visuals or whatever you want to call the real life depictions of almost everything, is quite astonishing. So if nothing else this really looks good. The story is proven to engage, so they couldn't go wrong with that either. But they did add stuff and moved pieces around. Having a song that should play at night time sung during the day may be quite off putting. Other might feel that is nit-picking. Try to enjoy this for what it is, not what the original was ... otherwise it is more than likely you'll be dissapointed",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Feast your eyes ! not your brain ...,"14/10/2019 (6) Lion King (2019) 7.1/10Non-Spoiler-Ish ReviewSo the movie is beautiful. But the compassion ... not so muchThe main flaw of the movie was the songs executions and the color design throughout the movie.Don't get me wrong, some songs are good and just simply iconic. Some however, just do not land for me like the ""Can you feel the love tonight"" song. It's more like afternoon love and not night :))).To be precise, some songs felt cringy as the animation sequences and the songs seemed injected and forced.Story-wise, it's the same as the 1994 animation version. No difference.I would say that everything looks absolutely amazing! I cannot deny it. The technology to make this movie is stunning. I enjoy the feast on my eyes but not so much in my brain cause the 1994 version actually felt more authentic :).I am so wierd. The Jungle Book is actually better for me. Maybe because iit has a human affection within the movie and Lion King does not.Somewhat the same vibe with the modern Jungle Book movie. Same director after all",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Why?,"I left the theatre with one thought in my head, ""why?"" I fail to see why this was remade other than for money, because there is no sort personality or style of its own, and this remake doesn't offer any new kind of spin on this story, it's basically a shot for shot remake of a film that's already a classic. Why would I ever choose to watch this over the original? It's basically the same movie just without the personality and style of the original. With the photorealistic animals, you can't sympathize with any of them because they don't have any kind of expression, and therefore they can't express emotion. This just goes to show that there was a reason the film was animated in the first place. Also the original was a film that Disney didn't want to make at first, the artists were so passionate about this story that they started to make it anyways out of their own garage and no support from a studio, and yet they still crafted the greatest Disney film of all time. And now that same studio is using their story and milking it for money, because they know how popular it is, which is kind of slimey in my opinion. I can't give it a 0.5/5 because the visuals are spectacular, but none of the changes made to this film were for the better, and nothing of their own was added really. The only difference between this film and the original is that some scenes were shortened and some were drawn out, and all those scenes were terribly executed. So I ask again, when you're remaking something that you know you can't improve, and something that you're not going to change or add your own spin on, then why? Why remake it? It's already a classic, you're just redoing what is already perfect, but you're doing it without the passion, personality, and perfect execution. So, the only reason I can think of is, money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
A great visual treatment,"Watching a movie for the second time makes more memorable because it just fills our heart with images when we were watched already for the first time. Lion King went back to the past of the 2D animation period relying along with that addition on new technologies in the computer graphics. Obviously, it is an astonishing and brilliant visual treatment. Hans Zimmer my favorite composer again flourished my heart with that beautiful notes. A great way of presentation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Useless voice actors,"Never usually notice this kind of thing but the voice acting in this movie was terrible and emotionless. Particularly for Scar and Young Simba.

"This could have been amazing, but Beyonce happened.","In all fairness, the movie looks amazing, and purely on the looks the only thing that bothers me is that there is no emotions at all visible. Not the fear in Mufasa's eyes, or a smile when he's playing with the little cub.I under stand that animals don't have the possibility to use that much expression.. but a lot more could have been done. A WHOLE lot more.My other problem is Beyonce, I'm for sure not a fan of her except for a couple of songs that do show how talented she is.. but she is one of the biggest misses in this film.. her ad-libs and her annoying signature way of singing can you feel the love tonight would have made me walk out the theatre is I would have been alone...The last part which has changed a bit is the moment that Simba see's Mufasa inside him and when he returns home.. all I can say is that the original did it better.. and there is no need EVER to make Beyonce sing any song in a movie unless it's crazy in love with Jay-Z.I can't decide if this movie should be 5 or 6 stars.. the Hate i have towards beyonce's perfomance in this movie makes me want to give it a 5 or even a 4 star rating.
But in the theater, I have to say... I enjoyed the movie most of the parts.. There's countless of times where the expressions don't matter and where beyonce is not singing or doing her weird voice thingy..So 6 stars, it's worth a watch for sure.. but people in Hollywood should really let Beyonce go.. she's not that talented on screen and I can name countless of people who would perform better, but Tessa Thompson, Zendaya or Leona Lewis, Rihanna, Alicia Keys and Kelly Rowland would have been better if you want a famous singer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Two perspectives: a nine year old and a (significantly older) year old,"{Once again I cede my review to my AAC*, nine year old, Sophie.} Sophie told me: This and MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO are my favourite movies this year! I had heard that THE LION KING might be scary for anyone under 10, but I wasn't that scared (although I was a little scared, especially when things jumped out on the screen). I liked the way they made the animals talk (it would have been boring if they hadn't). I thought the last part (the fight on the cliff in the fire) was very exciting. There is a lot of singing. Most parts are happy and some parts are a little sad and scary. If you love animals, this will be a good movie for you. I give this movie a rating of 10 (the best) out of 10.(*Age Appropriate Critic)Thank you, Sophie. I'll add my two cents, now. I went into the movie with a little caution. This had been my mother's favourite Disney animated movie so it was going to be tricky emotionally, missing Mom and hoping they didn't mess it up. In some ways this was a different movie. They had to switch up some of the story telling to facilitate the difference between animation and live action. They added a couple of songs and of course the voice talent was all new. The highlights of the movie, for me, was the beautiful photography and the ambient soundtrack, which were so artfully intertwined. They also had the added problem that the real violence of nature had to be retrofitted for a young audience. I'm not sure the ""circle of life"" speech Mufasa gave Simba would have registered with the young audience and the violence that is inherent to life (and death) of wild creatures is hard to assimilate with cute cubs, personified chums and beloved characters, so it was confined to our heroes killing and eating non-character bugs and grubs. The exciting ending, of which Sophie spoke, I found to be a little long and drawn out. But, all in all, I thought it was a good movie. I will always prefer the original but give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Young Adventure}",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Find the Kid in You,"I've read some critic and audience reviews and I can't help but chuckle at the overly serious people not realizing they're watching a Disney movie. Sure, the movie was a lot less colorful and fun than it's predecessor, but it's the same movie with some amazing visual effects. Mind blowing, if you will.I've openly admitted that I don't think music was a good choice for this movie, I think an updated score of the songs we know and love would've worked well in place of the original songs. As weird as it is to see realistic animals speak, it's just as weird if not more to see them sing. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the nostalgia of some of my favorite songs used.I keep seeing people complain about a ""lack of emotion"", but I have to assume none of these people have pets. Dogs don't speak, but their body language and eyes speak volumes and these animals did the same. There was plenty of emotion, please don't believe the hype. Not to mention, the director did a phenomenal job at assuring that the way the camera moved also added to the emotion of the scene. I think people just wanted to see the 1994 movie, so much so that they were unwilling to embrace the new version.Speaking to embracing the new version, I think some of the line deliveries could've been better, but I'm torn because I don't know if I didn't like the delivery or if I'm used to hearing it differently. 1994 was 25 years ago, we've had 25 years to embrace, love and appreciate The Lion King for what it was. Give the new edition a real chance, I'm sure it'll grow on us all.Just for giggles, I plan to interview my cousins and upload their reactions to the web because I think while the movie was made for us, it's their generation that'll have it for the next 25 years and they deserve to appreciate it as we did the original. I remember this kid in the theater during the hyena chase scene shout, ""Run, Simba!"" it was the cutest thing! He felt the grief and stress of the scene as we all did and I think if children continue to react like this kid did, it'll implant this movie for the next 2.5 decades. I really hope it does.

THANK YOU DISNEY FOR RETAINING THE NOSTALGIA,"THE LION KING REVIEW :Animated Classics by Disney went on to cross the age barriers and box office calculations 2 decades ago and are stills remembered after so many years. The Lion King carrying immense popularity and high standard was never an easy task to be remade, yet the big names attested with product left us with some hopes. Thankfully Disney and Jon Favreau succeeds in retaining the Nostalgia of Original Animated Classic after 25 years. The quality of original classic can never be matched, it is always about going somewhere close to that level and The Lion King doesn't fail to walk on the right path.The Lion King is story about, as we all know King Mufasa murdered by his own brother Scar and then his Son Simba returns to aquire his Father's Kingdom. It is just not about the revenge, it is about Pride, honour, responsibility, being a True King and a Saviour. There is too much in this one narrative along with emotional Bonding and hilarious characters like Timon and Pumbaa. Firstly, the execution of such a big film is done excellently by makers. Disney does not compromise or reduce that Big Scale adventure. One could have never imagined animational biggie coming in live action on this much big canvas. Of course the credit will go to VFX makers as they not only create the fictional world but also made us believe in it. Screenplay having no loo breaks and dull portion is like tremendously turbo speed engine which picks up at the start and runs throughout till the end. Musically it was even a bigger challenge in this remake and fortunately that quality has been kept intact. Hans Zimmer returns to compose those lovable song and you're gonna love 'Hakuna Matata' anyways.From the director's point of view The Lion King lioks uncompromised, untouched and healthy remake. Jon Favreau missed something with The Jungle Book but this time he tried to bring everything possible from the original Saga. As a whole Jon Favreau's The Lion King retains the nostalgia of Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff's timeless tale in Mainstream Commercial entertainment attire. It might just fail to stand upto some people's expectations who have experienced the original one and kept it in heart forever otherwise, new generation gonna experience old wine in new Glass. Exclude those some people and you will definitely like it equally compared to the 1994's Memorial, oh sorry slightly less would be Great.RATING- 7/10*",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

There's no need to be worried about it for a story like The Lion King. The characters need more emotional expression and, despite CGI is very impressive, the movie probably fell into the uncanny valley. I still prefer watching the 2D animation because it's much more convincing.I have the feeling that some people (specially some influencers) deny the fact that the movie makes us a bit uncomfortable. Maybe the love for the original animation made people to accept this dissonance.I watched the Brazilian version with dubbed voices and at least the voice actors of Timon and Pumba did a great job.It's still worthy to watch this movie, but it could be better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

A little flat,"First I loved the the Lion King from 1994 - great soundtrack, great animation considering it wasn't computer animated but hand-drawn and an amazing voice casting. The latter is really where this movie falls short. the voice casting is so inferior compared to the 1994 version and the music shouldn't have been re-recorded. I actually think that Beyonce is miscasted as Nala both the talking part and the singing part. This is not hating on Beyonce. She's very talented but her voice just does'nt fit in this.

A happy surprise,"I was very sceptic going in, but the movie manages to preserve much of what was good about the original.

The Lion King for this generation!,"Just came back and with the original being my #1 favourite movie of all time, this still deserves a big fat 9!Does it improve on the original? No.
Was the movie necessary? No.
Are the voice actors comparable to the original? For the most part...no.
But is it enjoyable? Most definitely!!!I found the emotions on the animals' faces to be even better than the original. Mainly because of the small movements of ears, eyes, whiskers etc.If you go watch the movie with the attitude: it's a remake and it can never be as good as the original...you will leave the theatre as grumpy as you've entered it.
But give it a shot, go in there open minded and be amazed (again) about the new technology and the awesome animation, the great voice cast, good songs (ok I missed Jeremy Irons) and still to date the best Disney story ever!In the end it's all a matter of opinion.
My opinion is that if you rate this movie a 1, you are comparing it to the likes of Sharknado and embarrassing the original in your score.This is the Lion King for this generation!

"Visually stunning, emotionally lacklustre","In 2019, the lion king was one of my most anticipated film, only because of its director jon favreau who made the jungle book which for me is the best live action Disney remake till date. The original lion king I love very much. When the 2019 version received negative reviews from critics and audiences, I was still determined to watch it in theatres and finally I saw it.First of all, the visuals were absolutely stunning. Its completely a CGI remake and the CGI work is amazing. The animals looks, their movements were very realistic. The locations make you feel straight from national geographic channel. Hans Zimmer's score is as usual fantastic and this time he tweaked the tune to fit the tone. The voice casting was pretty good especially bringing back james earl jones who is irreplaceable as mufasa.Now coming to the negatives, the biggest drawback is it being a copy paste remake with hardly any creativity in writing. Lion king is a classic and I know makers don't want to take risk in tampering the script and spoiling it. But due to which it does not make sense to watch the same story again due to which everything is predictable. Another drawbacks is zero emotions. In the original lion king, animals were very expressive as they were anthropomorphic. But in live action, the animals look real and since the real animals don't emote here also they don't have any expression. The songs are very disappointing on screen especially the circle of life does not make you emotional like the original.On the whole, the 2019 version is visually stunning but emotionally weak. Since its a shot by shot remake, you won't get bored because of the original's brilliant script. Its old wine in new bottle.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Beyoncé is no doubt a brilliant singer but was definitely wrong for this role for this kind of musical it just didn't sound right at all. It lacked emotion and didn't have that kind of spark compared to the original. Don't know why there need to keep remaking classic movies just leave it. The movie was okay to watch I would not want to watch it again and I'm glad I didn't pay the money to see it at the cinema. Was little disappointed if you think it will be as good as the original then well it's not just don't go and watch and think it will be like the first lion king otherwise you will be disappointed which is what happened to me.

A different perspective,"There have been a lot of negative reviews discussing the use of CGI and inevitable lack of emotions in this movie. I think we can all agree that the original animated Lion King has stood the test of time, and the emotions that the animators invoke through their work is one of the reasons. The animated film has connected with audiences throughout generations. So if it is so beloved, what would be the point of remaking it?I challenge you to think about this film not as a simple remake of a classic Disney movie, but as a form of art. Yes, inevitably the CGI versions of the animals do not invoke strong emotional ties, but the imagery created by the computer is amazing!! The CGI is incredibly well done and the interactions between the animals appears to be so natural, as if this all could have actually taken place. And the imagination that the concept artists and voice over actors had to utilize in order to perform their work is also a tribute to their skill. Overall, this film is a work of art for reasons entirely different than its animated sibling and should be appreciated as such.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
A genuine and heart-felt portrayal of The Lion King,"I went to the cinema to watch this movie 2 days ago, and it was clear that everybody in the audience loved it.

Bland story with amazing visuals,I never watched lion king as a child so I was confused that should I watch the 1992 version or this one but I chose this one cause it looked amazing but I regret it now I watched glimpse of the 1992 version it seemed more funny more crisp this one felt like that they wanted their viewers to just get immersed in the visuals and forget everything else cause story has nothing in it typical hero villain story tbh I didn't expected it to be any good but I really expected it to be more funny and good music the latter part was very average except one hakuna Matata song felt like they just put music behind dialogues for the fun all the responsibilities was left on Timon pumba and whenever they were on screen I genuinely laughed but without them hm... nothing much voice over of some characters very good like Mufasa (Shahrukh delivered) but the voice of simba lacked certain emotionsSo I guess my first exposure to everyone's favourite lion king was sub par.,6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

"Great CGI, but so lifeless","Even though one can see how much work was put into making the lions as photorealistic as possible, as a remake of the original it lacks every bit of emotion and impact.
The voice acting can be really good and really emotional, while the lions just move their mouths lifelessly. Something about this difference in voice acting and visual presentation makes it kind of uncomfortable to watch even.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

"As a copy 10/10, otherwise 1/10","If I was supposed to review how well it copied the original, then this would be one of the best movies made by disney, but that would be an insult to the original Lion King, so I'll review only the originality of this one, and to be honest, there's not a lot of that. The only new scenes are fillers to extend the run time from 90 minutes to 118 minutes, so the only 'good' things are the effects, but even that is questionable, because that removes the magic, that made the original so special. Disney has to finnaly learn that more realistic looking doesn't immediately mean better!",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"What the heck? Just chill, people!","What's with the weird anger in some of these reviews? Are people mad that this installment of The Lion King is just a little different from the original?

So much work went into creating these images...you can see all the little details of the animals and the expressions...amazing.My husband was a little annoyed (not FURIOUS, mind you...just a little annoyed) that a few of the original funny lines and the ""squished banana"" song were left out. But overall, this movie held my attention, and the basic premise and emotion from the original was definitely intact.Some of the animals were just so adorable (like the little bush baby)! Plus, a lot of the humor was indeed included...so I have no real complaints. People are complaining about the singing...big deal.

Visually GREAT,"Amazing CGI. That's why I give this a 7. Actually, the movie was good. It is a visually movie. Greater experience for those who haven't seen the original from 1994. The original is a masterpiece. This new one lacks the emotions and facial expreccions. I think the actors trust to much with the CGI's in this movie. Overall I would not say this movie is bad. It is not an easy task to do a remake of the classic, and I think they did a nice effort. Just don't have to high expectations, especially if you already seen the first one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
I mean... I liked it,"Being someone who watched the original film daily, multiple times, as a kid and wanted to experience what it felt like back then, I really did. Being a photo realistic anination of the classic tale I got really into it, as a kid it was all about the amazing manuevers and crazy movements that made no sense! Going into this as an adult I wanted to see what it would become when those don't make any sense and we get down into reality.
A lot of people have bashed on the lack of facial expressions, but I felt otherwise (on top of this is if you wanna see how bad facial expressions would turn out on animals watch Netfilx Original Mowgli), though their faces were more realistic it was subtle changes in the eyes and twit hes of the moith that gave things away, really watch characters like Scar and you will see what I mean.
So in my honest opinion it was a really fun call back to what I loved as a kid in a more adult tone, would I see it again? Heck yes!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Just for show,"The photorealism of this film is second to none. The rendering of the animation is quite brilliant. it's probably the most realistic looking animation of all time. Of course the trade off with having the characters look like real animals does mean that they do not have the facial expressions to convey emotion in the way we humans recognise. For the vast majority of the movie the characters appear to have blank expressions, which is one of the aspects about this film that makes it feel soulless. Another aspect is the lack of effort that comes across in most of the voice acting. They all felt bland. There is no majesty or theatricality in their voices. Even James Earl Jones, returning as Mufasa, didn't feel right. I have to say the majority of the songs, most of which are iconic, just felt mediocre, and Beyonce's new song for this film, 'Spirit', is misplaced and almost completely forgettable. This best song is probably ""I can't wait to be king"" sung by Simba and Nala when they're just cubs. As far as story is concerned, it's just a carbon copy of the original. On the whole, this film just pales in comparison to the original in almost every department.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Don't waste your time,"I was very disappointed in this remake. The acting was very bland, kinda like eating paper.

Feels Soulless. It removes everything that made the original special.,"This movie basically ruined every aspect of the original that i loved...
It ruined the Hyenas, it ruined Scar, it Ruined the comedy, it ruined Timon and Pumba.
Yes, this movie is basically a ""scene for scene"" remake of the original, it copies everything directly from the cartoon.
But they took out all the charm and all the humor that the original had, while not adding anything good.
All of the comedic elements of the first one are gone, the hyenas are not fun anymore, they are just cliche genetic villains with no personality.
Same goes for Scar, hes not intimidating or interesting anymore. He sounds tired and old. All of the wit the character had is gone.
The entire movie is like this. They removed all the little fun parts and all the humor and the little details that makes the original so iconic.
Even when timon and pumba try to do humor, it comes as soulless. They end up being annoying instead of charming. Specially pumba. He was very annoying.Sure the cgi might look great, but at what cost? They focused so much in making the animals look so realistic, that they forgot to add a soul to the characters. They forgot to add any of the humor of the original.
This is just a soulless cgi clone.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Enchanting!,"Anyone who has lived with felines or other non-human creatures learns quickly how to interpret emotions through facial expressions, position of ears and tail and especially the appearance of the eyes. They don't need silly artificial grins or scowls. All the creatures in ""The Lion King"" expressed their emotions in the natural manner. The criticism about the characters lacking emotion is not valid.Characters were more fully developed in this live-action version, much more than they were in the animated version. The female lions (who do most of the work in lion prides) played a significant role in the opposition to Scar's assumption of the title of King.I'm not sure how much CGI was responsible for the action scenes, but they were executed to perfection. Han Zimmer's enthralling music swirled around the action loud and clear, and he was given recognition during the closing credits in large font displayed on a screen dedicated to him.All the actors breathed life into their characters through evocative voice work. Only Beyoncé was a little off, sounding more American than African.I'm glad I ignored the reviews and went to see the movie. If you haven't seen it, I hope you'll give it a chance...better hurry while it's still showing.

Original remains superior.,"To be honest after watching Aladdin (2019) I didn't had much expectation from this one as I figured, first of all Disney had guts to remake such a great classic and then spoiling it real bad, they won't hesitate to do it another time.For Disney this films are just profit and loss statements. They don't worry about public emotions, the Whistles, the tears and the cheering anymore, they just want there profit.The Lion King is another such example. It didn't had any emotional depth or intensity, it was quite hollow. I didn't fell anything when Mufasa died, I didn't fell anything when Simba returned from exile and moreover the animals didn't had any facial expression on their faces, we could only figure out their emotions through their tone. Hand written images were far better in this aspect.But they definately used their $ 260 million budget effectively, the VFX and CGI were damn good, much better than Aladdin (2019). The film was not at all bad, its quite enjoyable with great musical score you would definately feel nostalgic, but is this point valid enough to consider a film good , no, the film even have to score well in technological aspect, cinematography was quite average and the film was rushed at some parts, especially after half time.Just imagine if this would have been the original Lion king, it would have never even crossed a billion-dollar mark.But If you have planned to watch it and my review is holding you from that, then don't hesitate, its surely worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

The critics are crazy!!! Best live-action Disney remake yet!!,"Let's get one thing out of the way: the original animated Lion King is a masterpiece in every way. Nothing will ever ""top"" it. Nothing. Ever. Having said that, that is not the purpose of this live-action remake. The intention is simply to retell the beloved story in a way we've never seen it before: with ""real"" animals, or as remarkably close to it as modern technology allows. If you go into this movie with that purpose in mind, you will love it!Some viewers may be weirded out by seeing nature-documentary-realistic animals talking and singing. Suspension of disbelief aside, I personally was blown away by how true-to-life it all looked, and I feel privileged to live in an era that this level of technological achievement is even possible.Some complain about a lack of emotion in the characters. First of all, I didn't experience that at all. I laughed AND cried (in the appropriate moments), thought the music was flawless, and thought the voice actors did marvelous work conveying the emotions of their characters. Secondly, since these are meant to look like REAL animals, they *obviously* won't have the complex facial muscles that humans use to express emotions, or the flexibility of cartoon drawings. Despite these reasonable limitations, I thought the film did a superb job making me feel all the things it intended to.Bottom line: if you go into this film understanding and appreciating what it is setting out to do, then you will love it. I thought it told the beloved Lion King story with live-action perfection! No, it doesn't top the original, but it doesn't need to. It's a masterpiece of its own, and I have nothing but praise for it! Go see it for yourself!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Not as bad as the reviews suggest,"As Disney continue to create live action versions of their classic animated movies it was inevitable that they were going to eventually get round to creating The Lion King, arguably one of the most popular and most critically acclaimed Disney animations to date. Due to it's popularity I felt this was destined to be hated from the off as people just don't want new versions of their old favourites, I felt like the film was always going to struggle to win over the masses and that appears to be so having scrolled through the reviews and being met by a barrage of 1/10's. For me I enjoyed my time watching The Lion King as it was visually superb and Seth Rogen as Pumbaa just gave me constant laughs, he was perfect for the role. I would've like to have seen a few more characters re cast such as Jeremy Irons as Scar and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu just to add that little extra dose of nostalgia which I felt was lacking despite having James Earl Jones reprise his role as Mufasa. My main critique with this version of The Lion King was the casting of Beyoncé as Nala, I seriously hated the sound of her voice throughout as it just didn't seem suited to the movie and I felt Nala was given a bigger platform in this film because she was being voiced by Beyoncé, trying to justify her casting and the vast fortunes she was probably paid for lending her voice to the project. With that put to one side I enjoyed the movie, the songs for the most part were good to listen to and although I would've liked a bit more nostalgia and a little less Beyoncé I came out of the cinema feeling satisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Into the lions den,"So after this being a staple of my.daughters childhood we were both excited to go see this', however we left deflated and empty.
The lack lustre character voices left this a limp and unsatisfying.
Rafiki was almost a non entity. What happened to his over excited witch doctor persona-he became a faded almost not there baboon without presence.
Zazu...not one comment landed with humour and was flat. The morning report was read out not sang.
The 3 Hyenas. They had absolutely nothing sinister or calculating in them at all, they did not deliver the shivers.
Scar. Well yes.visually he looked defeated but his delivery of speech and terror was far from evil and nasty . It really missed the point of his persona he was weak and pitiful for all the wrong reasons. The lack of effort in the rendition of be prepared was shocking and underwhelming.
Simba and nala were weak voiced and why was Beyonce allowed to over sing her part. It's isn't meant to be warbled. You could almost visualise her reading the script it was so uncomfortable.
Timon and pumba again lost their presence.
It was mostly awkward.
Mustafa was a delight as the voice continued to carry his persona and relieved James Earl Jones did something to keep it feeling in line with the story .
Surabi had the most presence and passion.The visuals at times didn't match the message.Utterly utterly disappointed.How a cartoon and stage show can deliver tgis effortlessly and seamlessly time after time yet millions of pounds, millions of hours of cgi and skill managed to make it a poor relation to the story we all know and love.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Wow and wow!,"First ""wow"" is the negative one, it's for the people who rate this movie with a 1 because of stupidest reasons (""its all about the money, its the same as the original, its not the same as the original, I loved the original scene where simba eats green bug not the white one"" bla bla bla). Usually I wouldn't rate this with a 10 (probably would give it a 8 or a 9), but I'm just trying to even out the ratings.Second ""wow"" is the good one, it is for the movie itself.

Son of the Pride Lands,"The animation unit at Walt Disney Studios underwent something of a renaissance with the release of ""The Little Mermaid"" in 1989. The movie was a classic fairy tale, set to a Broadway-style musical score. After several lean years for the company, the film became a worldwide smash hit. So, on a late-night flight between London and New York, Jeffrey Katzenberg, chair of production at Disney, discussed a sequel with some of his executives. One of the suggestions was to make a kind of ""Bambi in Africa"", with lions. However, it was considered a high-risk project. From ""Snow White"" on, all Disney hits have started as classicals and featured humans. This was an original story with talking animals.In October 1991, several of the company's technical team travelled to the Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya. The idea was to study wild animals and the African environment for the upcoming movie. But after having worked for six months developing the story, the group got a nasty surprise. Instead of a documentary-like picture as initially planned, Jeffrey Katzenberg had now decided that ""The Lion King"" should be a fully-fledged musical instead.More than 600 animators worked on ""The Lion King"". Together, they generated thousands of hand-painted backgrounds and over a million drawings. Back in 1991, ""Beauty and the Beast"" became the first Disney production to use the so-called Computer Animation Production System. This time, the method was used to create the amazing wildebeest stampede sequence. All the animals were ""built"" in the computer and then replicated hundreds of times for the finished film.Even though critical reaction was muted, ""The Lion King"" drew record-breaking crowds. The film also became one of the best-selling home videos of all time, with millions of copies sold. But, sadly, ""The Lion King"" turned out to be the last Walt Disney production to be supervised by Jeffrey Katzenberg. Only weeks after the movie's premiere, he left the company to create DreamWorks Animation instead.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Phenomenal,"In late 1993, when audiences bored out of their minds from hearing about NAFTA went to the movies, they were greeting with a trailer that seemed to communicate one message: Summer 1994 belongs to Disney.What was in the trailer, you might ask. One sequence and one sequence alone. But what a sequence it was. They showed the very beginning of the film, where the animals all across the continent are bowing down to the new lion prince and king-to-be, Simba. If you have seen this movie- and if you haven't, I really do feel sorry for you- you know why that is all they needed.Honestly, this is far and away the best animated film Disney has ever produced or will ever produce. Most people of the critical persuasion prefer BatB, but I heartily disagree. Yes, BatB is probably a better movie plotwise and technically. But it's the kind of the film where I sit back and think, 'That was good. So was that. I love that angle. Those leaves are nice.' This is the kind of film that overloads me with grandeur and epicness and raw feats of animation and storytelling.It taps into something deeper, something essential to the human mind and spirit. True, I should expect something of the sort saying that it is clearly based on Shakespeare's Hamlet, but this film takes its material and runs as fast as a gazelle on the African plains. I am often borderline by how attached I am to this film and what it does. It's lush in a way that no Disney film (Frozen comes closest) can live up to.Most films strike me most the first time I see them, even films that I really like. Not this movie. Every time, it blows me away more and more. The more movies I see and the more things I experience, the more impressive this film becomes. It's extraordinary. At the top of the list of the extraordinary things it does is the animation. Comparing Western and Eastern 2-D animation is like comparing a mountain with a river, but I say here and now that this film somehow looks even better than Miyazaki's finest works, and believe me, that is not a compliment I through around lightly. The colors are so rich and the lines so well-defined. There are animated movies out there that want to make you think that you're not watching drawings. This film doesn't. This film proudly displays its art and soars with it.There are too many good scenes in this film to count. I won't spoil them in case you are part of the group of poor unfortunate souls who haven't yet seen the film, but they roll in, one right after the other. The climax in particular sticks out to me. It's probably one of the most atmospheric scenes in all of cinema.Some people throw around the word 'epic' lightly. I do not. I only say something is epic if it has the qualities of an epic. This does, which is impressive considering it is less than an hour and a half long. I wouldn't say it's quite as sprawling as LoTR or Princess Mononoke, but the way it manages do evoke the same feelings as those films in such a short running time is most impressive.The characters are not the best part of the film, but they are not particularly annoying either. Simba is fine, though I like him considerably more as a child than an adult. Nala is sympathetic and grounded and one of my favorite characters in the film. I used to hate Zazu when I first watched this movie as a kid, but I can identify with him more and more as I grow up. Serabi isn't particularly dynamic, but she is likable enough. Timon and Pumbaa annoy me, but they don't make the film any worse, and any damage they do is undone by Mufasa. Played by James Earl Jones, he is one of the coolest, most captivating movie characters ever. When he says something, you listen. I think the role would have still been good without Jones, but with him, it is legendary.Like most all 90's Disney movies, this is a musical, and a musical is nothing without great songs. I have forgiven a lot of subpar musicals because they had good songs, and I have bashed a lot of otherwise fine musicals for an excess of poor song numbers. The songs here are fantastic.The Circle of Life would be my choice if I had to pick a new Disney song to replace When You Wish Upon a Star. It is anthemic. I Just Can't Wait to be King is one of my all time guilty pleasures. Whenever I'm feeling down in the dumps, I cue it up, and within five minutes I'm dancing to jungle drums. But my all time favorite is Can You Feel the Love Tonight? This was originally intended to be a joke duet sung by Timon and Pumbaa, but Elton John made them change it, and I thank him for it. Not only did this song win at the Oscars (three Lion King songs were nominated that year, forcing them to change the rules so only one song per movie is eligible), Elton John's version of it won Best Male Performance at the Grammy's. It won award after award and rightfully so. It is the most sweepingly romantic song I've ever heard. Listen to the Elton John version though. It's better than the one in the movie.This isn't just a generational touchstone or an all-time classic. It's one of the best movies of all time and a sterling showcase for the power of animation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Animals are dope tho,The animals were epic fam! However there was too much love and gross stuff. That wouldn't bother most people but I'm mentally and intellectually six years old. Also the sun set animation was cool as epic fam! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Scar: Misunderstood?,"When discussing this epic movie, there is always some guy saying:''Well, I didn't cry when Mufasa died. Why should I? Scar was the ultimate character of the movie with all these lines, being ironic and after all he was deeply misunderstood''. Let's take this straight...Scar, neglected by his parents...always left out...watching Mufasa being raised as the favorite son, turned bad...There is some truth to this, but what about personal choice? Scar chose to kill his own brother and sent Simba away racked with guilt in order to rule the kingdom...Clap clap... Instead, he could be cool uncle Scar: ignoring power, loved by his nephew and all the others for being just that!(OK nobody would watch that:-P) What I really want to say is, we can't just blame our predecessors for what we've become...It's all about choicesWhere are WE in this circle of life?",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Excellent Timeless Masterpiece..❤❤❤,"The Lion King is one of the movies that Ihad seen in my childhood. It is a phenomenon of the ages. There is no film like it or never will be. Animated or not, this film is the best in everything. Characters have been portrayed so well in their contrasts and similarities, each being unique. The story is about every theme - Paternal and Maternal Love, Romance, Comedy, Betrayal, Guilt, Redemption and Reclamation. I saw the new one, and believe me, it sucked totally. Wouldn't even come within miles of this film. The jungle book is even more lively than the new one in 2019.
Which brings me back to our Classic.
The music is so genuine, 'Circle of Life', 'Be Prepared', ' I Just Can't Wait To Be King', Hakuna Matata', 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight?' are so memorable. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is epic. The cinematography grips you from the moment you watch it till the end. The animation is so genuine and heartfelt. It gives me the chills, the song of 'Be Prepared'. Overall a classic for the ages.❤❤❤",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Childhood Movie,Most amazing movie i watched growing up as a kid i loved it and think every new generation of kids should watch this.the way it teaches lessons to kids in this movie can be applied to the real world. the songs are amazing and the voices of the characters are good also. Graphics have improved since when i was younger till now. I also recommend the other Lion King's should be watched too. My favorite character is Simba's best friend shows a strong friendship their also. Just very awesome and for the whole family kind of movies. I think kids and adults of all ages and sizes can enjoy this. its a great bonding experience for everyone the whole family. Keeps you at the edge of your seat every moment.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

I will never stop loving this film,"Is anyone else scared to see the 2019 version for fear of it tarnishing the original? I mean, I'm still going to see it, but the original Lion King was and is one of the most memorable animated films I've ever seen. I also think it's a perfect intro to loss for kids.

Wonderful Movie,"Lion King is one of most best movies of all time.i really like this animation and a lot of my friends too.i recommend this movie to you especially for young girls,they love this movie for sure. Simba was a very cute person and Nala too.this is timeless movie. A young lion prince is born in Africa,thus making his uncle Scar the second in line to the throne. Scar plots with the hyenas to kill King Mufasa and Prince Simba, thus making himself King. The King is killed and Simba is led to believe by Scar that it was his fault, and so flees the kingdom in shame. After years of exile he is persuaded to return home to overthrow the usurper and claim the kingdom as his own thus completing the ""Circle of Life"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Amazing.,Movies was amazing. One of my favorite Disney movies. I cried when I first seen it.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Amazing!!!! Activated my feelings...,"This is my all time movie simply because it activated my feelings in me. At the age of 5 i saw this movie and it was a video cassette. from that day on I never forgot the moment i pressed play. The moment where I cried and my feelings where activated to the world. I still have the video cassette and i will keep it because it has a meaning which can't be sold. Lion King has also made me realise that the world isn't just about humans and we humans ain't the only creatures on earth with feelings. I really hope kids these days would watch it and realise how strong of a movie it is and who knows if that could bring Lion King the movie out using the latest technology to attract the new generations. Just so you know the meaning that this movie has for me and is so strong, that my first tattoo is Simba the one that the monkey draws on the tree. when its done i shall post a picture up. Anyway people, stay loved and blessed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
"Not a personal favorite, but no one can deny its brilliance.","For a long time I have been deeply thinking about what I really think of The Lion King. After watching all the animated Disney movies I can see its brilliance, even though it isn't a personal favorite of mine and there are other animated Disney movies I think deserve more attention.Let me make it clear. TLK is among the most beautifully animated Disney movies. The stampede scene is just huge and intimidating, the intro scene is by far the most iconic scene from any Disney movie along with one of the most iconic and grandest songs ever to be in a movie. The backgrounds are amazing, the whole animation aspect of it is amazing. On that spot it is an undoubted masterpiece.And I must admit that the culmination of the stampede scene with Simba, Mufasa and Scar will for ever be the most emotionally charged scene in a Disney movie if not in a movie in general.The voice acting is good. James Earl Jones is never a disappointment with his booming voice. Jeremy Irons does make a great, slimy, backstabbing, power hungry villain, but falls a little flat when he comes to power compared to both earlier power hungry villains like Maleficent and Jafar and my personal favorite Frollo. But that's a nit-pick, because story-wise it's essential, because we see how young Simba dreams of being a king who can do whatever he wants and that is what Scar turns into when he comes to power.""The Circle of Life"" which as mentioned before is perhaps the grandest Disney song ever and one of the most iconic openings of any movie. Not just in Disney, but in general. The rest of the music is catchy and memorable and serves the story well. I am not as fond of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" as I am of earlier love songs like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""A Whole New World"" simply because the love aspect is kind of disturbing since lions live in prides which consist of family, so therefore making Simba and Nala relatives. ""Be Prepared"" has a great visual appeal and serves the scene well, but when I listen to it on its own it comes off as just another ""I-want-power-because-I'm-evil"" song. The african inspiration in the music is amazing, nothing more to say.I must admit that I'm not a big fan of Timon and Pumbaa, but I don't hate them, not at all. They raised Simba, but the fact that they had a tv-show and a direct-to-video film, the latter which I think is garbage, just made me think badly of them.It is my personal opinion. I feel at times TLK is a little overrated, but it is undoubtedly a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

Lion king,"This is mine personally my favourite Disney movie excluding Pixar for a couple of reasons to start off with I grew up with because most Disney movies if I didn't see as a kid but as an adult I probably wouldn't like them but when you rematch the ones you watched as a kid it's still good if that makes any sense for example I love Beauty and the beast and lion king because I watched them as a child but I never watched Little mermaid or Aladin as a kid(don't get mad at me) but I didn't like them as much because I diddint grow up with themThis also has the best music out of all of them I can name Hakunah Matatah, Be prepared, circle of life, Can you feel the love tonight, and Can't wait to be king off of my head cause they were great and co written by Elton John and that's part of why it was so memerable in short Lion king is great to rewatch older and good to watch with your kids",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

"Wonderful, perfect","I watched this film in 1994 when I was 10. I remember being astonished, thrilled and completely absorbed in this story. And there were tears, of course. The colours, theme song, animal movements - they're all perfect. I bought The Lion Kids DVD a few days ago, for my kids now, and I can say that the magic is still there. The themes are universal - love, family relations, betrayal, growing up...so everyone can relate to the story and feel the emotions. And the great thing is that it is not only appealing to children but to adults as well. The Lion King is a great mixture of singing and musical elements, appealing and cute animal characters, great animation, beautiful African landscape and serious themes of rivalry, betrayal and fratricide.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"

The Greatest Animated Film,"When I first watched The Lion King, I had mixed feelings about it. I've never been a fan of Elton John, and his songs are less than impressive. The animation is stunning, and I thought the voice actors were all cast perfectly - especially Matthew Broderick as adult Simba, as well as Jeremy Irons as Scar. I know the quintessential tearjerking part is when Mufasa dies, but the part that always gets to me is at the end when Simba finally ascends Pride Rock and looks up into the clouds and hears his father say ""Remember..."" It gets to me every time! All in all,I was very impressed with the DVD version.I especially love the voice talents of Matthew Broderick,Jonathan Taylor Thomas,Jeremy Irons,Whoopi Goldberg,Rowan Atkinson,and many others. Great job!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
Perfection,"This film is my childhood. As an individual who studied acting and music professionally... this piece of work is near perfection. Great classical story structure, unforgettable music, and overall Disney masterpiece. I highly advise that all who love this film go see the Broadway production in Times Square. You will NOT be disappointed with the work that they brought to the stage for this all-time Disney stellar. Furthermore, if any individual has yet to see this animated feature film... adult or child... it's NOT too late! Please let this production become a part of you.

The old school animation can never be beat in my opinion. Just knowing every scene was drawn with hundreds of pictures still fascinates me.

My personal favorite character is Rafiki, the Baboon! I still cant forget the line he says to Simbe, ""Past can hurt, but as I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it!"" it is so true! I loved Zazu's weirdness, and shenzi's humor, above all, i loved Pumba's innocence and Timon's intelligence! In short, i found the film the best film ever... The voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justice to Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dad anyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, its meant to teach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great ""Circle Of Life"".

Review,"The Lion KingDo you want to set the mood for a movie? You need to realize that music is the best way to create an ambience to a scene, and it's, besides visuals, the most important thing in a movie.Simba is a lion, the son of a king, but the nephew of a frustrated, evil almost-king.
Simba goes from place to place discovering new things, until one day, his father dies in the hands of his uncle, who claims the throne and exiles Simba. The little lion goes far away from the pride and is found by a warthog and a meerkat, Timon and Pumba, the ones that some time later, convince him to go back and claim the throne, so he does.I heard that this movie was based on Hamlet, but the emotional impact that the Lion King has on kids is huge, not just because of the story, but the music that goes with it creates such a synesthesia that you cannot disconnect your feelings from it. Hanz Zimmer did a really great job on this soundtrack.This movie is, in my opinion, one of the most revolutionary animated movies of all time, but without its music, the impact wouldn't be as huge as it is. The Lion king is the complement of its story, characters, emotionality and music. A total masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
An animation masterpiece and a more enduring modern story from the Disney staple,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSimba is a young lion cub, born to his father Mustafa, the ruler of Pride Rock. This means he will grow up to ascend the throne after Mustafa, to the envy of his evil uncle Scar, who forms an alliance with the hyenas of the barrens, personally killing Mustafa and arranging to have them kill Simba, who disappears into the wilderness. Years later, he re-emerges to claim his rightful place and take down the evil Scar.It's a scary thing when you start to notice you're getting older, when films you remember seeing when they first came out are re-released for a new generation, especially when you remember seeing them when you were so young. What with the recent re-release of Jurassic Park and now this 3D re release of one of Disney's more original works, not adapted from any old fairy tales or children's stories. But, with the onslaught of admittedly amazing Pixar wonders that tend to do the rounds more nowadays, The Lion King is a timely reminder of just how well Disney can do when left to it's own devices.While you often get infinitely more cynical as an adult, the timeless wonders of Disney animations are an opportunity to re-connect with your inner child and appreciate something that works on a more superficial appeal than what is required to appreciate more gritty, hard hitting adult stuff. That said, as well as having fluffy kids appeal (most notably with the I Just Can't Wait to be King and Hakuna Matada musical interludes) TLK also plays out with themes of a more traditional Greek tragedy, of jealousy, murder and revenge that gives it an under lyingly more darker tone...I do remember parents being advised to watch with younger children on the back of the video I used to own and maybe it's not that hard to see why.It's hard to recall a really bad Disney animation, and The Lion King is not only no exception, it's a prime example of why they hold such timeless appeal for child and adult alike, an animation masterpiece that will always hold an appeal to anyone who sees it (and even more so if you first saw it when you were young.) *****",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Drama"
