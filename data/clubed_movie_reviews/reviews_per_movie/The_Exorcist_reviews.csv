The Exorcist,"Stunning visuals, effects and overall horror for 1973. The characters are very strongly portrayed and the feeling of hopelessness is ever-present throughout the movie. Even though some scenes are outright shocking and provocative, there is also a strong element of the uncanny present. This is a very haunting movie that still shocks, amazes and intrigues after all these years.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The most ""ripped-off"" movie of all time","According to the film critics, the Exorcist is the only movie about demonic possession that should have ever been made. Every subsequent movie with a ""possession"" theme was labeled a ""rip-off."" I'm pretty sure that Beyond the Door was the first ""rip-off."" One film critic described this movie as vulgar. Perhaps. Was the Exorcist any less vulgar? The Exorcist had a good director, good actors and good production values. It is these attributes which set the Exorcist apart from all the follow-up films. However, if you are offended by someone regurgitating green slime, does it really matter whether it's coming from Linda Blair or anyone else? I have always thought that the Exorcist worked as well on a dramatic level as it does a horror movie. This is probably something you shouldn't be able to say about an effective horror movie. I once listened to William Friedkin's audio commentary while watching the movie. He and I agree on which scene is the best part of the movie. It is the exchange between Ellen Burstyn and the great Lee J Cobb. As a police lieutenant, Cobb has more compassion for Burstyn than priest she seeks help from. When Cobb is about to leave Burstyn's house, he says: ""You're a nice lady."" She replies: ""You're a nice man."" This is actually touching! Ironically, this touching scene is directly followed by one of the most wild and disturbing scenes in the movie. In fact, I've always wondered how the movie escaped an X rating with this scene intact. However, I still believe the tender scene which precedes this resonates more. All things considered, the Exorcist is definitely one of the greatest horror movies of all time, as well as one of the most influential. Not number one, though. My choice for Number One took place in Texas. Something to do with chain saws.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Still a powerful film, more than thirty years on...","More than thirty years on, The Exorcist remains a very powerful film and was a cinematographic milestone in 1973. Repeated duplication of the genre has, no doubt, 'desensitized' a new generation of movie-watchers, though it remains an unnerving masterpiece. It is not difficult to understand why the film generated such a seismic global impact all those years ago, since it imposed an unprecedented sensory attack on the viewer. Regan's vile physical appearance, combined with her vile language and blasphemous diatribe sent a shock wave around the world. Moreover, many people seemed to believe the claims that the film was based on a true story and could therefore actually happen to them. Electricity consumption must have soared for several months in 1973 as people who had seen the film slept with their lights on! It is still not a film I would feel comfortable watching before going to bed. On another level, I found parts of it profoundly moving and actually cried at the end when Regan was finally released from her possessor and wept in the arms of her mother and Father Damien, having lunged himself through a window and down a precipitous flight of steps, managed to find just enough life in himself to indicate that he had retained his faith and repented of his sins by motioning his fingers in the sign of penitence when comforted by a distraught colleague. Possibly the only thing that lets the film down if one really sits and thinks about it is the underpinning concept that an ancient demon which had existed since the dawn of time should wish to possess the body of a twelve year old child and emit a string of juvenile profanities. But then the film was designed to shock all along!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Devil Made Her Do It,"In late 1973 and early 1974, women and men were lined up for blocks. People were known to become ill watching it. Some fainted. Some ran out of the theater in tears. There were reports of people having to be institutionalized, and at least one miscarriage was attributed to viewing it. No, it wasn't a Rolling Stones Concert. It was a film called The Exorcist.The first time I had heard of something called The Exorcist was on late night television when the author, William Peter Blatty, was a guest on The Tonight Show. The conversation centered around how horrible some of the things in the book were. I had also seen the novel listed on The New York Times Bestseller List, and it seemed as if it would remain there forever. After having been on the waiting list for what seemed like an eternity at the local library, I was finally able to obtain a copy. It was the first book I had read in one sitting since probably Nancy Drew and The Hidden Staircase quite a few years earlier. And yes, for it's time it was filled with gut wrenching details of what happens when for some unexplained reason; an innocent girl is possessed by Satan. While reading the book I was sure that if it ever made its way to film, most of the details would certainly be either `cleaned up' or omitted altogether. As you know the film was made and it spared the movie going public absolutely nothing in the way of details.Certainly many of the people who lined up to see The Exorcist did so to watch some of the more gruesome scenes, the worst of which involved Regan's masturbation with a crucifix. Yet, the hysteria went well beyond the fact that such scenes were so vividly depicted. I think one needs to look no further than Mel Gibson's The Passion to find the answer as to why. I'm sure most of you have read the story of people leaving Mel's film in tears, some to the point of being hysterical. From most articles I have read, it seems that the majority of the audience that was moved were those people of strong religious beliefs. For many others, the depiction of the brutality in The Passion may have been uncomfortable to sit through, but weren't emotionally effected to any degree. Much of this same feeling can explain the hysteria surrounding The Exorcist. Those who had a definitive belief in Heaven and Hell, of Good and Evil, of Jesus as The Savior and Satan as the epitome of pure evil were affected by The Exorcist far more than those who were agnostic or just never had a strong belief in spiritual matters. There is no doubt though that much in the way The Passion did, The Exorcist caused many to reconsider how they felt about their faith. The Exorcist made the prospect of Satan being alive and well and a life of eternal damnation a very uncomfortable prospect. The fact that Blatty claims his book and screenplay were based on a true story seemed to give the film even more credibility.For me, The Exorcist has always been more about the never ending conflict between pure evil and pure innocence than about being an average horror story. There are many more levels to this film than what initially meets the eye. There is no doubt that while the main story revolves around an innocent young girl, Regan McNeil (Linda Blair), being inhabited by Satan himself, Blatty enhances it greatly by adding different characters in various stages of conflict. Regan's mother, Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) obviously cares deeply for her daughter. Yet she is not beyond reproach. In one scene when Reagan's father hasn't called on Regan's birthday, we see her desperately on the phone doing battle with an overseas operator. The problem is not how vicious the phone call is, but that she does it within ear shot of her daughter as if to drive the point home to Regan how worthless her father is. When, she finally does seek the aid of Father Damian Karras, we don't feel that she believes in exorcism anymore than he does, but is desperate enough to accept the fact that it is possible and will take any and all measures to save her daughter.Father Karras (Jason Miller) is a priest torn by conflict. He is ridden by overwhelming guilt for having abandoned his mother to enter the priesthood. He is torn spiritually by the confessions of those priests who seek his help as a psychiatrist, so much so that he now questions his own faith. When he states to the Bishop that `Regan's case meets all the criteria,' we know that even more than Chris, he doesn't really believe in the power of Satan to inhabit a living being in the manner that it has taken over Regan. Yet, he will do what is required of him as a priest concerned about the health of a child.Jack McGowran gives a terrific performance as the alcoholic director filming Chris's latest film in Georgetown. Kitty Winn is Sharon Spencer, the secretary who works for Chris and always seems to be in the line of fire when Chris is angry. She is always there but for all the horror she witnesses, Winn appears too bland and emotionless and her performance is probably the weakest in the film.Max Von Sydow as Father Lancester Merrin is a no nonsense aging priest. He has done battle with evil before and he shows us its effect in every scene he occupies. One could pass it off to being just good make-up but it is so much more than that as Sydow demonstrates all the nuances that brings to life a man who has faced Satan and lived to tell about it. He knows what he is up against, understands he must do it again and the consequences of what that battle may be.If I have a small complaint with The Exorcist it is in regards to the character of Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb). I have never been able to buy into the character. It is not the fault of Cobb who is his usual stalwart self in the role. The whole character should at best have only been necessary for a few brief scenes yet; he has several that go on way too long and do not add anything to the story. Even in his scenes with Chris or Damian, Kinderman is so odd that he distracts us too much from their characters and it is Chris and Damian's reactions that are more important to us, not his investigation. For all you trivia buffs out there, Blatty once sued the producers of Columbo, stating they based Peter Falk's character on Kinderman. If memory serves me correctly Blatty lost that one.As for Director William Friedken, although he won the best director award for The French Connection, for me The Exorcist will always remain his defining film. The Final half hour of The Exorcist are still as dynamic today as they were 31 years ago, French Connection car chase be damned.It seems that to many of the younger movie audiences of today, The Exorcist has become more of a joke than anything else. That's not surprising considering how many times it has been lampooned, even by Linda Blair herself in Repossessed. Yet, if they were to view the film in a more serious vein, not as just another creature feature, they may just find that there really is more to this film than a little girl spewing pea soup and spinning her head around 360 degrees. It is the ultimate battle between Heaven and Hell and Good and Evil. It is the story of the complete and total degradation of innocence. It is a study in character, and whether a man torn by the forces surrounding him, can regain his faith and his belief in God and mankind to save the life of a little girl, caught up in forces beyond her control.Call it a horror film, call it a religious film, call it what you want. For me, The Exorcist is and will always remain a classic in every sense of the word. And if I regard you as a classic of any kind I have no choice but to leave you with my grade, which for The Exorcist is an A.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unmatched brilliance,"There is a reason for the hysteria and mystique surrounding THE EXORCIST. And it's called genius.Never have I seen a film matched in shock, terror, writing, or performances. This isn't a horror movie.  The film itself is both a moving and terrifying drama that takes a realistic look at what would actually happen if a young girl were possessed in modern America.  William Peter Blatty's script is amazing, bringing depth to the characters, and presenting the mystery of faith that they all deal with.  Is Regan possessed?  Is she insane?  And most importantly, Is there a God?  In the course of two hours, we see a sweet and innocent young girl become a cross masturbating, head spinning, murderous, creature.  We see a successful actress overcome skepticism to save her daughter, and we see a brilliant psychiatrist struggle with his devotion to God as a priest.Friedkin's direction is marvelous, with wonderful uses of light, dark, and color throughout the film.  Jason Miller (as Damien Karras) is beautifully subtle in his first film acting role.  Max Von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb provide engaging supporting performances as the experienced priest who senses his impending doom, and a detective who senses something sinister is at work. Ellen Burstyn gives a brutally honest performance as a grief stricken woman trying to save her daughter.  And most of all, a 12-year-old Linda Blair gives one of the most terrifying, convincing, and beautiful performances ever shown on film.  Her range of emotion and connection to Regan are astonishing.  She deserved that Oscar!THE EXORCIST presents to us the mystery of faith in it's most raw form--the battle of good and evil.  It is an incomparable masterpiece of film, done without the aid of computers and special effects.  It relies on story and performances to give us a marvelous and terrifying piece of work.  In the end, it makes us ask ourselves what we believe, and keeps us wondering and shuddering at exactally what might be out there.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An intense and very terrifying movie that will make you sleep with the bible a few nights in a row,"The Exorcist is one of the best movies to come out of the 70's and deserves better than slowly descending down the top 250. It's one of those essential films you have to see in order to understand what a movie truly is and this is more than a horror film. Unfortunately there are so many people who are saying they got bored, I think because they expected a terrifying movie, people! This isn't a slasher movie, this isn't some scary Michael Myers that you can shoot, this is a story about normal people in a normal house and upstairs there is a little girl who happens to be possessed by ""The devil himself"". Faith is so strong and when it's shaken, anything in your imagination can run wild.First off the actors: Ellen Burstyn plays Chris McNeil, an actress working in Washington, D.C. on a film. She is the mother of Regan, the little girl who is possessed. I felt such sorrow for Chris, when she begs Father Karras to help her with Regan, I almost cried for her. Her daughter is not sick, this is nothing she can give Regan a pill and she'll be better. Her speech to Father Karras later on in the film: ""You show me Regan's double, same face, same voice, everything. And I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut. Now, I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter, except in her mind. You tell me for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!"" sent shivers down my spine, this woman knows what Regan needs and will do whatever she can.We have Linda Blair who plays Regan and she was so great for a 12 year old actress. This little apple faced girl became one of the most frightening images of the 70's and still to this day. She's not scary because she's swearing, this little innocent girl has been taken over by forces that she shouldn't even know about. Jason Miller as Father Karras, for a man who had never acted professionally before, he was quite amazing as a priest who just lost his mother and his faith has been shaken up. Max Von Sydow as Father Merrin was so strong and he was like in his 20's playing a man in his 90's. He was robbed of an Oscar, he was so believable and just amazing during the exorcism scene.The effects? People! This was the 70's and they made a bed float! They turned this little angel's face into a hideous creature! If you watch the documentary ""Fear of God: The Making of the Exorcist"", Ellen Burstyn gets slapped by Regan in the film and she had kind of a rope tied around her waist. When the stunt man pulled her back, Billy the director told the guy to let her have it and he YANKED her back hard causing real pain in Ellen's back and that was an actual scream in the movie. They froze the room to the point as were moisture got into the set and there was a layer of snow in the morning they were shooting. There was no CGI, this was the real deal and I believe could truly help the actors. Linda Blair was being thrashed up and down during one of the possessed scenes where the bracing came loose and caused slamming of metal to her back repeatedly and her screams were also very real and bone chilling.William Freidkin is the director of The Exorcist, and there was no better choice. This guy took this picture seriously, so far as to shoot a gun offstage or scream obscenities to get an actor's shocked reaction on film. He slapped almost punched Reverend William O'Malley who played Father Dyer to get him to shake during his reciting the Last Rites to Father Karras. He almost would have killed to make this picture and anyone doing it.Weither or not the set of The Exorcist was truly cursed with a total of 9 deaths linked to the film, a fire on the set with no apparent reason, and the total feeling of evil around the room, we'll never know. But The Exorcist is a true motion picture never to missed or deserve no more than the true compliments it should get! This is the film that should be shown to any aspiring film makers. It's a masterpiece of a film that's more than a mere horror flick.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the greatest ever!!,"Some movies are landmarks. This is one of them.Good : There are a lot of goods that I can talk about this particular film. First off, every gothic horror, for example, The Conjuring, are inspired by this film in one way or the other. But, none of them are as good as this one. I love Conjuring 1 & 2, but that might have never existed if it weren't for this movie. So, what makes it so good? We are given a mysterious introduction to an old priest who would play a prominent role later. It gives layers to the character of young priest, which is quite interesting. The set up is done quite well. The story is being told quite well. And it has the most important aspect that most horror films today lack - the dread and actually terrifying scenes. Right from the opening credits, it feels uneasy. It tries to give us a really terrifying vibe. And it just intensifies further and further. Even the scenes having no tension don't feel like so. And, it cuts to some terrifying scenes so suddenly but smoothly that we will be exclaiming ""holy (you know what)!"". That's some true horror film. It was 1973. You had absolutely no technology or CGI. They still made an entire bed shake which looked so scary and realistic! The 180 degree turn is still an awesome effect. They did it way better, and all of it looked more realistic than CGI! It had some ideas involving Ouija board and exorcism, which are now termed as ""clichés"". Having watched so many horror films before watching this, it should've felt corny. But it felt real good. There is probably no horror movie, in particular a supernatural or gothic horror movie, that has not been inspired by this movie in some way or the other. And the ones which got as many things right as possible as in this one, were respectively better. This movie is a masterpiece!!Bad : It has sequels. Damn those pathetic sequels!! But again, good God almighty, only few people know about those stupid movies.Conclusion : It is a must watch for every horror fan. Some parts may feel clichéd to some, but that's where those ""clichés"" started. Go with a fresh mind and examine how it all started. I am optimistic that you will love it.Rating.Score : absolute 10/10Grade : A+",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It just doesn't scare me anymore...,"... and it was pretty scary when I saw it in 1974. Maybe the horror has shifted somewhat for me. In 1974 I was 16 and I was sheltered from the horror of real life. So horror films were the only thing that probably could scare me.Today it plays like a very good drama, and what scares me the most is being put in Ellen Burstyn's place as the mother and not having a clue as to what is going on with her daughter and the patronizing doctors with their useless and apparently painful tests. Also the parallel drama of Father Karras having a crisis of faith and of conscience over the death of his mother is well done and well played as part of the larger story.There is a great supporting cast with old veteran Lee J. Cobb as the cop. But there are some holes in the plot. I mean, what does Cobb think is going on anyways? Does he think a girl that sick can push a man out of a window? He's like a noir character in search of a villain. And, at least in the film, there is never a connection made between a girl in Georgetown, Washington D.C. suddenly becoming possessed and digging up an artifact in a foreign land. I haven't read the book, maybe there the connection is made. And what is going on with leaving a window open at night in Washington,D.C. As somebody who lives near there, I can tell you if you do this, something much scarier than a demon is coming in through that window! This is the big city, not Mayberry!Some production notes: Linda Blair was in fact 15 when this movie was made, not 12. The radiology technician in the hospital scene was a legitimate active serial killer at the time of filming. Max Von Sydow was only 44 at the time of filming, not a very old man. It's odd how he has always and convincingly played men much older than himself. The ""spider walk"" scene was added back into the film years later. I have no idea why they elected to take that out of the original release. It's a sledgehammer to the face. On second thought, maybe that is the reason they took it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
THE EXORCIST---A PERFECT FILM,"Many people complain that this movie's too slow but those are the kind of folks who only like 80-minute splatter films with characters so dumb and one-sided, you pray for the bad guy to kill them.  This monster of a drama is both beautiful and bold.  It has CHARACTERS and not simply LAMEBRAINS lined up for slaughter.  It has class and purpose.  It takes the audience into the darkest recesses of humankind and then brings them back through a message of hope and self-sacrifice.  The movie is NOT anti-religion, it's anti-evil.  Anyone who likes smart, clever, meaningful horror-drama should see this film at least twice.  It is surprisingly touching and amazingly powerful.That said, the cast deserves a hand for their wonderful performances.  Ellen Burstyn perfectly conveys the tension of a mother of the cusp of tragedy; Max von Sydow is hauntingly perfect as the story's ray of light;   Jason Miller embodies the sadness of a defeated man; and Linda Blair is far above average even at her young age.Once again, see this movie.  You won't forget it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Engraved into your minds...forever,"For those who watched this film on the big screen when it was re-released and thought it was 'comical, funny, not disturbing nor scary' are  just do not understand the complexity that surrounds this movie. Back in '73, no one was expecting a film of this kind, and I know it has been said many times but it WAS way ahead of its time. A time where cinema was in its infancy, religion was practiced on a larger scale than today and showing such violent, graphic and disturbing scenes was not thought of as being possible, one can understand why it has been banned for so many years.I recently watched this movie (at night, before bedtime) and it really left me thinking of how such horrifying scenes could be shown and portrayed in such a way. There were many scenes that would not get out of my head (for those who have seen the movie would know what scenes they are). I could not sleep that night and that hasn't happened since I saw Nightmare On Elm Street Part 1 when I was 6!What makes things worse is that there are well known cases where  people have been possessed by the devil or a supernatural being, which leads them in doing evil deeds.When you mix a horror movie with religion on such a large magnitude, things can heat up and become very unpleasant.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still A Masterpiece After 45 Years,"I recently revisited this film on Blu-ray after some 45 years. It still rates as one of my favourite horror films, one of my top ten films and a masterpiece of film making. Beautiful photography, great locations, sets, special effects and acting.

I almost feel ashamed for not liking this film,"There is a very frustrating scene from Jaws 2 where Brody walks into the selectsmen's meeting carrying the photograph that the two divers took as they were being eaten.  Brody sees the outline of the mouth and the eye. And he should know what a shark looks like.  But when he passes it around, Harry saysSeaweed?"" Verna Fields says, ""it's under water isn't it?  That's why it's so dark?""  They can't see something that is so obviously and that is bothersome.  That is how I feel about my reaction to the Exorcist. Everyone has told me how frightening it is and how it is a psychological trip.  And I know the reaction that audiences had towards it in the 70's. But as much as I try, I just can't see it.  It is not a scary movie and it is not even an enjoyable one, and I would even go so far as to say that it is not even a good movie.First off, there are so many parts of this film that have nothing to do with what the film is about.  The first hour is nothing.  It really has no relevance to the rest of the film.  And for the life of me I really can't understand what the beginning is about.  Why do we need the background of the Exorcist in Iraq?  What does that have to do with the film and how does it further the plot?  I don't get it.Secondly, this is a very poorly editted film.  There were times that I cringed at some of the editting.  It was such a blatant cut that you felt like you could see the editors crazy gluing the film together.  And I am not saying that to be cruel, I really mean that.Thirdly, and this is the big one, what is so scary about this film? Really, all Regan did was get her face scarred a bit, vomit a lot, yell out obsenities and blugeon herself with a cross.  Now that is interesting in the fact that this must have sent a shock wave through the religious community because you are not supposed to say or do anything bad towards the church. But in terms of scares or chills?  No way, they just weren't there.  I can admire a film like Halloween and Blair Witch for being innovative enough to scare us but no this film.  Frankly, I was bored.  I really was.  There were times that I wanted to turn this off and watch the baseball game, and we all know how boring baseball is on the tube.  But this film moved at a snails pace.  And if they would have cut it down by about thirty minutes, it may have been better.The other element that I can't get past is the fact that this was the devil himself.  Okay, let's just say it is.  Why does it allow himself to be tied down?  Why does it jump at water that isn't holy?  Why does it possess a girl when it can come onto this Earth in human form if it wanted to.  When Lucifer was kicked out of Heaven, he was abolished because of greed and a lust for power.  So for an angel to be that despised must have been considered dangerous and powerful.  If that is so, then why all the scenes of Satan being dominated by humans?  Are you saying that the best he could come up with is making a girl puke, levitate, and throw a few things around the room?  That sounds more like he was just having a bad day because he couldn't get his own way.  That doesn't sound like the personification of evil.  You want to see real evil, watch DeNiro in Angel Heart.The Exorcist is a film that has it's place in history and I can admire it for that.  And to be honest I almost feel like someone that doesn't like The Blair Witch Project.  I can't understand why people can't like that film, that is true fear for me.  So when I say that this film is really not that good, I can understand why people may think I'm ignorant, but when you compare this to A Nightmare On Elm Street or Halloween, can you honestly say that this has more to offer?  And if you can say that, well, I just don't see it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the few movies to genuinely unsettle me,"The horror genre is a genre that has been growing on me overtime, and I genuinely believe The Exorcist is a landmark of it. Not just how much it's talked about or parodied, but also its ability to unnerve and unsettle me even years later. The Exorcist is a fantastic film, both as a film of its genre and of film full-stop. The effects are superb and have held up very well, and the sound is marvellous and adds to the many startling moments. The cinematography and scenery are also incredibly well done. The macabre, obscene demonstrations of manifest evil on display still startle even now, while William Friedkin's direction is one of his best and most intelligent of his career, not just making the scares genuine but also combining these with allegorical religious subtleties. The performances also lift, Linda Blair is really quite startling, and you couldn't have had more perfect support from Max Von Sydow and Ellen Burstyn. Overall, genuinely unsettling and effective. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
They don't make em like they used to...,"""The scariest movie of all time"". Some movie goers agree and some disagree. I belong to the former group, though I would like to rephrase it to ""One of the scariest movies of all time"". For those of you who have been living in a cave for the past twenty two years, the story is of a pre-pubescent girl, Regan (Linda Blair), possessed by a demon whom purports to be the Devil himself (""Now kindly undo these straps!"").In this day and age of schlock fest horror films being relentlessly released (or spewed out for want of a better term) by the big wig studios on a quest to cash in on the latest teenage trend, this premise for a horror story may not seem so scary to most. However, it's the road we take to arrive at this supposition that makes this film stand out from the rest.The seeds of dread and fear are planted early with screen legend Max Von Sydow's Father Merrin receiving disturbing and familiar Omens of what is to come during an archaeological dig in Northern Iraq.We're then taken to the setting where the real horror will begin in the Georgetown home of Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), a successful divorcée film actress living with her daughter Regan. We're initially presented with a Regan who loves horses, has a close and loving relationship with her mother, is uncomfortable with the strained relationship between her parents and has the innocent demeanour and narrow vocabulary of every normal young girl.The carefully crafted and ever so gradual change in Regan's personality, the strange drawings and figurines she creates, the emergence of Captain Howdy (Regan's imaginary friend) and strange outbursts (""You're gonna die up there"") and so called physical convulsions force Chris to turn to doctors and eventually psychiatrists to try and get to the bottom of Regan's ever worsening behaviour. Her vocabulary becomes quite extensive with spine chilling, sudden maturity and her outbursts more terrifyingly violent. After exhausting all the ""somatic"" possibilities for Regan's troubles Chris desperately seeks help from world weary Jesuit Psychiatrist Priest Father Karras (Jason Miller) requesting an exorcism.By the time Karras meets Regan, any semblance of the innocent young girl has completely vanished. Karras is grappling with his faith and subsequently doubts she is truly 'possessed'. Finally convinced that an exorcism is the way to go, he seeks permission from the Catholic Church, who grant him with the condition that he perform it with the help of the experienced Father Merrin.Merrin arrives like a knight in shining armour for the ultimate showdown! A great screenplay by William Peter Blatty (based on his book), intelligent directing from William Friedken and outstanding performances from all the cast, particularly Ellen Burstyn as the traumatised mother make for a classic piece of horror that will stand the test of time. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Exorcist....more than a mere horror film,"The Exorcist is the best horror film ever made and there is one reason for this,the subject matter is treated with dignity and respect,too many ""horror films"" are made today that just don't try,it's as if they give up half way through and fall into self  parody and amusement.the Exorcist is an exception and one of the very few good horror films around.the film works on a number of levels and is one of the few films I know of to do this i.e subliminal imagery,multiple storylines. a lot has been written about this film drawing mainly on sensationalism surrounding the films release that it would be hard for someone who has not seen the film to not have any preconceptions,but if you have not seen the film do try to keep an open mind because it will scare the hell out of you.this is also one of the rare cases where a film could arguably be better than the book it was adapted from.in my opinion the film could not have been made any better,the cast throughout are superb, the locations and production are second to none,all the characters are totally  believable and there are points in the film where you think all this could really happen and it is for that reason the film is frightening and continues to frighten people to this day....a true shocker and one that has not lost any of its impact over the years.",,Anonymous,Horror

There is plenty of excellent actors in this film as well. Loads of great performances from actors such as: Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, Max von Sydow. I pressure you to see the re-edited one. Trust me, it's not a remake. It's a better editing of sound and picture, and even some NEW footage that is of the same quality.If you enjoy horror movies of any kind, and/or like a good drama, this film is for you. A Head-spinning performance from Linda Blair makes it even more horrific, seeing a little innocent child getting possessed by a horrid demon. Ellen Burstyn give another great performance, as a mother going through shock and worry about what is happening to her daughter. This acting is all together very powerful, realistic and leaves for a better cinematic experience overall.Other great notable parts of the movie, are the satisfying amount of good dialog, quotes, and scenes. Gut-wrenching horror conjoins with gritty drama in this absolutely awe-inspiring movie. See it for yourself if you haven't yet, you must; because it is definitely a memorable film.4 of 4 Stars",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Bad; Just Overhyped,"It's hard to believe the furor that was apparently caused when this movie was first released. I was just 10 years old at the time and never saw it in the theatres, and, in fact, only just recently saw it for the first time. It struck me as a pretty standard horror movie about a young girl possessed by the devil. I didn't find it shocking or horrific, and have seen movies that were far more frightening than this.The highlight of the movie, I would say, was the absolutely brilliant performance by young Linda Blair as the possessed Regan. She has apparently said over the years that this movie was the end of any real acting career for her, because she became so deeply associated with this character in the public imagination. That's the price, I guess, when your first movie performance is so brilliant and so controversial. With no body of work before to balance it, Linda Blair became Regan MacNeil. Jason Miller was effective as Father Damien, but was overshadowed by Blair. It was also, I thought, a good study of a priest who had become a psychologist more than a theologian (far too common in all Christian denominations, even today.) Max Von Sydow's performance as Father Merrin (called in by the Church to confront the demon) was quite good.I got lost a bit in the beginning of this movie, which dealt with some of Merrin's background, and there was also no real explanation of how this girl got possessed (which, however, is probably making a point: evil can strike anywhere for no obvious reason.)In the end, I just found this to be a decent horror movie, but I didn't think there was anything spectacular about it. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Review of The Exorcist.,"For as long as I can recall, I've always possessed (no pun intended) an innate feeling that there exists outside the realm of our established dogma things that defy conventional logic. When I was in the sixth grade, I read the book, ""The Exorcist,"" which scared me senseless. The idea that the Devil could infiltrate the delicate core of one's being called a soul absolutely terrified me at such a young age. After seeing the movie, I was speechless. Have been ever since. William Friedkin's transformation of the book to the movie was superb, in my opinion. (Not all adaptations are.) Dick Smith's special effects, in contrast to today's make-up advancements in the film industry, are still able to stand the test of time. The acting was splendid, from Lee J. Cobb & Jason Miller, to Ellen Burstyn and Max von Sydow's limited appearance in the piece. Friedkin's slice-of-life direction enhances the essence of the fear-factor in an oddly subtle fashion, as though the viewer were actually alongside the characters in the film. Lending to the creepiness of the film is the fact that there exists a minimal musical score (Mike Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells"" does accompany two nuns strolling gingerly down a Georgetown street in autumn, their robes billowing slightly in the wind). The palpability of what happens to a young Linda Blair has astounded me for over three decades. Having been so taken with the notion that inhuman entities DO stalk the earth and have never existed in human form, I've written a couple of novels on the subject matter, myself. I liken the new version that had been released a few years ago to the last nail in the proverbial coffin of effectiveness, making this one of the best horror-genre films of all time. Simply put: I've never seen any film that remotely comes close to what this movie has done to me (in terms of frightening me senseless). Linda Blair's cute Regan MacNeil is utterly transformed into a beast which is flat-out disturbing to behold. The movie has moved me ever since I had seen it at age fourteen, and I suspect will always. Put simply, at age forty-three I still have a difficult time watching it on my own. Great job, Mr. Friedkin and crew!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still Terrifying After 50 Years,"7/10The Exorcist is a groundbreaking horror film with some truly terrifying moments. However, it is also a very long and disturbing film, and I found it difficult to watch at times.The film's special effects are still impressive today, and the performances from Linda Blair and Ellen Burstyn are excellent. However, I found the film's pacing to be slow and its tone to be overly bleak.Overall, I would recommend The Exorcist to fans of horror films who are looking for a truly terrifying experience. However, I would caution viewers that the film is very long and disturbing, and it may not be suitable for everyone.Recommended for: fans of horror films who are looking for a truly terrifying experienceNot recommended for: the faint of heart, people who are easily disturbed, people who do not like long films.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wow... what a bad movie.,"Having looked over the other user comments, I see there are some definite patterns in how people react to this movie. Religious people think it is horrifying, agnostic people think it is creepy, and atheist people think it is hilarious. But I really can't figure out the people who say it's scary because of its ""subtlety."" How on earth is vomiting, head twisting, levitation, and masturbation subtle? This movie is intended to shock and offend, not scare. I mean, a ""subtle"" possession movie would have the demon murmuring in a low, unearthly voice, not shrieking like the Incredible Hulk. Everything is just too over-the-top.There are parts that are pretty sick and twisted, but nothing really scary. It didn't take me long to figure out that this is nothing but shock schlock. I didn't find it as funny as some people do (although the pea soup vomit was rather amusing), but I did find it disappointing, insulting, and irritating.4/10 stars.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Simply, the greatest ""Horror"" film ever made  ...","What scares us more than anything? The answers are multiple : the dark, the evil, a mysterious presence, death ultimately; in fact, anything incontrollable. And when you think about it, all these elements have something in common: they refer to an unknown force whose presence is palpable. Indeed, the unknown scares, because it can't be seen, can't be controlled, therefore, can't be fought.These are the primitives fears that tortured the life of people since the dawn of humanity, and we inherited this fears in the same unconscious way our children will. We're aware of our mortal nature, and each of our fears is driven by this awareness, which is due to the biggest fear, the fear of the unknown. And the genius of ""The Exorcist"" is that it perfectly plays on these primitive instincts of ours, to provide the greatest Horror film ever made, a thrilling masterpiece of realism that'll haunt cinematic memories for ever.As soon as the Tubular bells start ringing, the film is inhabited by an atmosphere that will never desert it, a fearsome and gloomy ambiance absorbing any place we're watching the film in. Everything is directed with such confidence and meticulousness, the thrills almost come precociously. Indeed, before anything happens, we feel something WILL happen, but we don't know what. It seems like a cinematic trick, but not any director has the guts to let you wait more than almost half an hour before the oddities happen. The set-up is slow paced in ""The Exorcist"" because it's a movie that respects our intelligence, and doesn't try to provide cheap thrills. William Friedkin who had just made another realistic masterpiece, the Best Picture Winner ""The French Connection"" is so confident he gives us enough time to discover the characters, to get into their daily life, patiently waiting for the pivotal point that will join their fates. The direction, the writing are all in subtlety, and work because even though nothing happens yet, we keep our guard up, we know there's an evil presence somewhere, we can feel it.This is an old cinematic device started by directors who hadn't enough money to portray credible monster-type villains: they understood that sometimes, the scare is more efficient from the suggestion of a presence than its explicit depiction. When you see, you know, and if you know, you can control, but in ""The Exorcist"", the villain is here, but we never see him, he's like the shark from ""Jaws"" or ""Alien"", with a slight difference, he's not visible because he controls the body of a poor little girl. Linda Blair, as the demonically possessed Regan MacNeil , is so convincing, it broke my heart to see how the evil can have so devastating effects on a pure little soul. And the tragedy of Regan is the torment of her mother, Chris, Ellen Burstyn, perfect as a totally helpless woman, incapable of saving her little girl. And this is the fascinating aspect of the film, more than a horror drama, it also works as a thrilling mystery. A mystery where the Lieutenant Detective Kinderman, Lee J. Cobb in one of his great last roles, is the one who investigates about the strange phenomena that occurred and acts as a bridge between the victims and the priests.So many questions are raised in the beginning, we understand that sooner or later, we'll have an exorcism. Well, it's the title, isn't it? But the set-up is necessary. The parallel stories where we're transported into the universes of Father Damien Karras, portrayed by Jason Miller, and the iconic Father Merryl, Max Von Sydow, challenge our patience: we can't wait for the exorcism ... but without the build-up, the climax would be worthless. It's a movie where any flaws can be caused by an impatience from the director, an eagerness to distract the masses with thrilling moments, but a big impatience could have ruined such a magnificent and ambitious project. And ""The Exorcist"" would never have been the masterpiece it is without this patience. However, this would never have been such an iconic horror masterpiece without the few horrifying moments that punctuate the movie between the set-up and the climax. And by horrifying, I won't give any clues, let's just say it works on every level: visual, sounds, atmosphere, cinematography, dialogs, special effects, and of course, timing, since all these effects come at the least expected moments, provoking reactions in total symbiosis with the characters. We feel and fear for them, as the realism implies that it could even happen to us. This is no Hollywood, this is true horror.Lately, the American Film institute listed the Top 100 movies and I must admit I was shocked not to see ""The Exorcist"" in the list... it's a classic, probably the most horrifying horror film ever made. It has everything, a dazzling cinematography incarnated by the iconic shot of Father Merryl's shadowy silhouette coming from the mist, an unforgettable villain, and of course shocking moments where the make-up, the visual and sound effects prove how vital they are for such a genre that relies so much on realism. But this realism would have been nothing without the genius of the script and the masterful direction, that could finally let the film exude all its greatness in the last act, one of the most unforgettable climactic sequences ever, putting ""The Exorcist"" among those films that transcends the simple act of watching, becoming more of experiences.And this is why I waited for years and years before finally getting to watch ""The Exorcist"", one of the few movies that scared me even before watching it. And all I can say is that it met my expectations. And watching it at night (with someone, I would recommend) gets more hypnotic and absorbing after each viewing  ""The Exorcist"" is a must-see and ... be careful, any second, it can surprise you, really",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Suspense , mystery , shocks and grisly horror is this classic terror film","This known story concerns about a mother (Ellen Burstyn) and her daughter (Linda Blair), the latter is possessed and two Fathers , Karras (Jason Miller) and Merrin (Max Von Sidow) attempt to free Regan MacNeil from possession by the devil .

On the first day of filming the exorcism sequence, Linda Blair's delivery of her foul-mouthed dialogue so disturbed the gentlemanly Max Von Sydow that he actually forgot his lines . The script is awesome , the acting excellent and the direction by William Friedkin plenty of good pace and conviction . Enjoyable secondary cast such as Lee J Cobb , Kitty Winn and Jack McGowran who died at the time finished the movie and added a legend about Exorcist's curse . Dark cinematography in sinister and mysterious atmosphere by Owen Roitzman and frightening musical score adding Mike Oldfield's soundtrack ¨Tubular bells¨ .

"One Genre Renewal movie: The Exorcist - Horror with no Crime, instead Horror with Spirits","Two terrible sequels and one irrelevant remake were never replaced with the original, the 1973 version of The Exorcist; and no other version will never be any more. Written for the screen and produced by William Peter Blatty, both The Exorcist movie and the novel are incident driven basis of the actual happenings from 1949.Looking at the most remarkable movies of 1973, there are 3 other important ones that the history of cinema will remember: -- A slow and touching movie from Ingmar Bergman ""Cries and Whispers"" -- Bernardo Bertolucci's depressive movie, a study of love ""Last Tango in Paris"" -- A crime story with Redford and Newman ""The Sting"". Among all and all the other movies that are produced in this year, The Exorcist stands one step further than the rest for its uniqueness on genre renewal. It's not the first movie that features the Demon in its content, yet in the Exorcist the Demon is introduced in the human level. The idea of being possessed by a spirit is used for the first time ever on the silver-screen. Horror genre featuring spirits didn't need to refer to Crime any more like it used to be in Hitchcock ages. Thus crime became a separate genre, and mostly acted conjointly with thrillers from now on.This uniqueness profits from its sound mixing, great lighting techniques and of course a perfect screenplay. Director William Friedkin was lucky to find his producer Blatty, being also the novel-writer and the idea creator. The plot and the story development goes very smoothly: From Father Merrin's encountering with the Demon Pazuzu in Iraq; to Ellen Burstyn looking for the cure for her daughter's disease, going for visits to every type of doctor... From the noises in the attic, to Regan's peeing on the rug... From decoding the Demon's speech of speaking English in reverse, to the arriving of Merrin... Both the editing and directing gave high qualities to this film.The 25th Anniversary edition DVD is in my movie collections. It's a must to have for horror fans. Either you have this version of DVD or the year 2000 version; you should check out the special features that reveals the real-life 1949 incident, the missing and the deleted scenes including the Spider-walk scene, sound mixing and sound effects tests show how they created the demon's voice and the BBC documentary: The Fear of God, all in the special features.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Deep Archetypical Contrasts,"In the documentary on the DVD, von Sydow says that if you are open to it, this film will scare you and perhaps affect you spiritually. Certainly true. Why this and not the many other similar films? Keep in mind that essentially all the rest of Friedkin's work is mundane, worthless.A large part of the question, I think, is that the creators of the film have stumbled into a rich field of archetypal conflicts, stuff deeper than just a sweet kid cursing and masturbating.The film is set in a Jesuit University. Even today, if you go there, you find a very strange vibe. The notion of authoritarian faith being crammed down from above certainly has a place in society, but such a brotherhood running an academy of open inquiry is a puzzling, disturbing mix. And that's underscored and mirrored by a similar (though less militant) conflict around psychiatry. Here we have the priests of `medicine' torturing this little girl to confirm their theories.The priest is the center of the film, and embodies all this: Arcane `faith' versus modern inquiry; Taking direction blindly rather than acting on knowledge; Understanding the mind versus understanding the soul; Serving the weak (his mother) versus battling powerful evil. Friedkin increased these ambiguities wherever he found them, usually against the positivist stance of Blatty.Interesting in this context are two tricks, one conscious, the other I suspect not.The conscious one is the self-referential wrapper. This is film about a film star, making a film. What triggers the possession are the visits by the director who probably had some deviant intent or action. He is the first victim. Thus, Friedkin places himself in the action and himself openly exploits Linda Blair. Meanwhile the actor playing the director dies in real life.The unconscious one is the Persian reference. Best scholarship has Judaism coming from Zoroastrianism flavored by Egyptian superficialities. A lower form of Zoroastrianism devolved into the much more widely adopted Mithraism, characterized by the warring of good and evil. This is sort of the professional wrestling of religious belief, both in style and substance, and continues today to be the root of `fundamentalism.' So in a very real way, Satan was invented in northern Iran, and any student of religion will end up `digging' around there.How sad and strange that this film seems to have bolstered the Catholic church.",,Anonymous,Horror
A horror/drama with real meaning behind it.,"The main thing I really liked about this film was how different it was from many of today's horror films. It wasn't just your classic slaughter movie with the worst actors or just completely dumb characters who you almost want to route against, but instead was interesting with characters who actually had purpose in the movie other than to just be butchered. I would call this movie a horror but it may also be a drama as well. It takes a great look at what would actually happen if a young child were to become possessed in 1973, and I believe that's why so many people became so afraid of this movie or of the idea because of how realistically sounding this was. This movies impact reminds me a lot of like the movie JAWS. Once that movie came out and people heard if shark attacks being reported their was a mass hysteria which just added to the intensity of the movie and same with THE EXORCISM. The movie is one of the few horror movies where it actually has meaning and life to it instead of it just becoming a slaughter house halfway through.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"cerebral, plausible, and compelling","There are certain scenes in ""The Exorcist"" that have a great power to them (the exorcism itself is a masterful set-piece) and others that are a bit shaky (including the drunk, unfunny director cracking Nazi jokes in the presence of a German butler); but overall, it is a film that mines genuine fear from a pervasive sense of vulnerability. In dealing with the possession of a young girl (Linda Blair) by an unseen, inexplicable force, we feel as if nothing is safe, therefore making the potential of horror that much greater. I suppose the story is probably the most familiar in the annals of horror at this point, but to recap: actress Chris MacNeil's (Ellen Burstyn) daughter, Regan (Blair) comes under the spell of a vile, vulgar demon (at one point implied to be the Devil itself), and when the most well-paid psychiatrists and doctors come up clueless, the Catholic ritual of exorcism is suggested. While the performances of Burstyn and Blair aren't revelatory (Chris often seems like an overly dramatic starlet in need of a Xanax, and Regan is confined to heavy make-up), the thread of plot dealing with Damien Karras (the Gabriel Byrne-ish Jason Miller), a priest who suffers the death of his mother and is afraid he's losing his faith, adds a believable, consequential depth to the tale--the visible doubt he conveys during the exorcism finale (alongside the brilliant Max von Sydow) makes the tension resonate on a higher level. ""The Exorcist"" is cerebral, plausible, and compelling...in my book, it may not be 'the scariest movie of all time,' but it unlocks an undeniably gripping fear.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Horror Classic,"This is a very highly rated horror movie for a good reason, when it was realised it broke the mould of everything that preceded it, and set the standard for the horror genre for decades to come; because of this it should retain its place Movie history forever.The sheer terror this movie instilled in people, during the year of its release is even today unmatched by anything. Time, however has altered its effect on its audience, we simply are not as easily shocked as we used to be.For anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet, my advice is this, approach it with an open mind, and remember when it was made, this is the only way you will appreciate it for what it is.Difficult for new audiences to appreciate, but it is still a classic, time won't change that.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A landmark horror.,"Chris MacNeil is terrified when her 12 year old daughter Regan begins behaving in a strange and shocking manner, and begins changing physically, she turns to The Catholic Church for help.Here in The UK this film was banned from its initial release, all the way through to 1999, fortunately copies did appear here and there, and I've always wondered if the ban was because of its horror moments, or some of the religious aspects.The Exorcist is quite simply a brilliant movie, so much more than just a terrifying horror, it truly is a masterpiece, I've always put it ho there with Halloween in that it kind of defines a genre, and inspired a whole host of movies, here though, you can't beat the original.Every single character is well realised and serves a purpose, Father Karras is so well developed, that whole story about his mother's death really does shape him.Most people know this film for one very famous scene, and that is of course the iconic moment, even people that haven't seen the film know the association, but this film is so much more.Terrific performances throughout, Max Von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn and a young Linda Blair are all excellent, I've always thought Jason Miller stole the show.This film is beautifully filmed and edited, it's an incredibly well produced film, and as for the music, it's incredible, it still evokes feelings of fear.

Not scary: downright amazing.,"I was influenced into watching this film after maybe the 100th listen to Mike Oldfield's masterpiece ""Tubular Bells"" (the full, 48-minute album, not the 4-minute edit!), which was used in this movie's soundtrack. I wasn't exactly frightened or scared by the movie. I was expecting something gory and gruesome in this movie, but oh, was I wrong. And that's good, because I don't like movies that are gratuitously gory and gruesome. This movie is anything but gratuitous. I wasn't scared, but I was amazed and fascinated by the atmosphere, intelligent story and masterful filmmaking. It feels really genuine, and there are maybe 2 or 3 movies I have seen that felt genuine. It's a beautiful story about faith, and deals with the ""good vs. evil"" scheme in an unusual way. There are so many layers to the story, it's difficult to discuss them all in one or two paragraphs. Suffice to say, all of those different elements come together seamlessly. The story is beautiful. The build up of tension is truly gripping. It is not scary, it's disturbing. Those looking for gory scarefests should look somewhere else. I was truly intrigued by the movie, and the glorious resolution was both shocking and uplifting. Did good defeat evil, after all? That's up for the viewers to decide.A haunting movie, this is - especially for Mr. Oldfield, whose ""Tubular Bells"" would haunt him for 30 years.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Exhibitionist,"Demon delights in crudities and vulgarities in 'The Exorcist' which is shocking because the vehicle for this expression is a 12 year old girl and the primary witness is her middle aged mother. By contrast the Catholic clergy are reluctant to perform and suffer from appalling stage fright when cajoled into action and there's no chance of repeat performances.Every adult character has copious problems and they are all made up, and photographed, and lit to be ugly and unappealing visually.The harshness of this imagery contrasts with the lurid colours of the demonic possession which oozes rank and festering colour versus the muted imagery for the human cast.The acting is styled in a similarly muted manner, which has clearly been directed across the board from all the actors, and is reflected in the low key casting of most roles.The sound mix is a major plus with average ambient sound effects and dialogue pick up, but impactful special sound effects and scoring which amounts to a powerful influence.The overall conclusion is that the demonic entity is loud, lurid, luscious and lewd, colourful and charismatic whereas the humans are all the opposite. Barely alive, hardly animated, barely coloured.Everything detailed maxes out the impact of the demon inside the girl. Here the film has one of its most shocking values as the sexually orientated explicitness is portrayed through a 12 year old.The second cause for unease is the medical attention that the child must endure, which is unsettling for those who are squeamish about medicine and hospitals. This is in contrast to the hands on and human efforts of the Catholic priests who are called in after the failures of modern medicine.I rate at 6/10 and really, a lot of points are lost in my rating due to the rough edges that are obvious in many scenes and sequences, and due to the inefficiency of the narrative; I watched the theatrical cut many years ago and just now watched the extended directors cut: both are just inefficient storytelling structures; the editing could be much tighter, and the drabness of the human cast leaves them unfulfilling as characters.I recommend to supernatural horror fans and fans of kids baiting stiff adults. Its worth seeing this film whether you find it scary or silly.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Event Movie (Marketing Over Content),"Purists may enthuse about the lack of modern day special effects but what they fail to mention is that without these, The Exorcist captures all the excitement of an insurance seminar without an interlude.  To dispute with the purists, not all supernatural movies are spoilt with the dabbling of special effects.  With a premise not entirely different from The Exorcist, Poltergeist succeeded in enthralling an audience with the discerning use of ""garish"" effects and yet still managed to work up searing tension in the quieter moments.Not that any amount of editing would have brought this decaying carcass to life but the movie would have been better served missing the entire prologue, where we were treated to Max Von Sydow ambling along dusty passageways whilst looking horrified at finding some cheap bauble from a Christmas cracker.Without doubt, this so called masterpiece has surpassed all others in exploiting the ""event movie"".  It seems that by succeeding in getting a film withdrawn on it's initial release, in time it can become regarded as a classic - however underwhelming it may be. Simply by throwing in a few blasphemous expletives by a minor, this movie has been hailed as an icon of the horror genre.  Classic status should only be awarded to pictures which have stood the test of time.  Judging by the laughter from the audience at my screening, The Exorcist has not been able to sustain any fear factor 25 years later - if it ever did at all!  For those salivating over their first screening of this horror behemoth, prepare yourself for the fact that it plays about as frightening as an episode of Scooby Doo. In the case of The Exorcist (re-issue), the event is undoubtedly bigger than the movie.Please don't consider these views solely a ranting from an upstart of the MTV generation.  There are many horror movies made in the pre-Wes Craven era which have maintained classic status through the test of time and are still capable of terrifying today's audience - not just those who saw it way-back-then and still harbour fond memories.  With that in mind, special message to Gus van Sant:  You didn't need to waste your talents on a shot-for-shot remake of Psycho.  If you really wanted to challenge yourself, you could have concentrated on creating something resembling an effective chiller from this overhyped pap.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Scariest Movie? No Way!,"The reason why I wanted to watch 'The Exorcist' was because I heard so much about it. For me this film is slightly over-hyped. It's painfully slow and at times very boring. It may have been great for its time when films of this genre were quite limited. Personally, I didn't find it scary at all but I don't hold that against the film. There have been numerous 'horror' films that haven't scared me but which I still like because of how the concept was presented, the ideas it raised, technical aspects etc. 'The Exorcist' is not an all bad film. The characters (except that of the devil) are very well written and the acting is very good, especially that of Jason Miller, Ellen Burstyn and Max Von Sydow. The story is not bad either. On the technical side, cinematography and background score are superb. I also liked the use of lighting, darkness that create the gloomy setup. The visuals and imagery are also impressive and the special effects do not look out of date. The scenes I liked more were those between Karras and MacNeil, especially the one where they meet for the first time. The 'horror' scenes did not do much for me (although they were well shot). To sum it up, while liking so many things about it, the pacing is lethargic and I was almost dozing off at some point. Perhaps it was the time of the day and if the plot was a little tighter I may have enjoyed it more. However, all things considered, for me 'The Exorcist' is a decent flick at best. I wouldn't put it among the best films.",,Anonymous,Horror
First time watching in 2023,"It's really hard to review this movie in 2023, at this point I have watched about 3000 horror movies and I'm an absolute genre lover, however there are some really big classics that I've never seen and always spared to watch. Now that the new Exorcist: Believer movie came out, I thought it's the perfect timing for me to see the Exorcist franchise. The original is known to be one of the best horror movies ever made and so my expectations were really high.I have lots of respect for the movie and what the creators made for the genre when they created it back in 1973 but the problem is that most memorable scenes have been either copied or seen by me from clips or other things. So the only new thing left for me was the story in general which was good but didn't completely overwhelm me. The whole shock factor from some of this scenes that made the viewers stomach turn just isn't the same as back in the day, especially if you've seen this much horror. The movie goes for a tense and eerie atmosphere instead of pointless jump scares every few minutes and has some really scary imagery with some deep hitting drama mixed in. All and all I really respect the movie and never wanna criticize its status but seeing it this late sadly took some of the enjoyment.However it's a great movie and should be watched by every genre fan or movie fan in general.

One of the best horror movies ever made,"What's remarkable about The Exorcist, especially when you compare it to other horror films, is its patience. It takes the time to calmly develop the ordinary home life of a modern postnuclear family, letting you get comfortable in the setting, and then things slowly get stranger and stranger, until eventually everything you knew has been upset or overturned.There's a fear of the future here, of a new deviancy that the older generation can neither understand or control, which very much positions The Exorcist in the social battles of its age, possibly even as a backlash against the youth revolt of the 1960s. But there's also a more universal fear here -- the fears of parenthood, and the unshakable notion that your child might turn out to be a monster and you would be responsible.More than this social commentary, what stands out is the excellence of execution -- the note-perfect direction, pacing, cinematography, and acting. None of this is very flashy, but it all has a kind of technical skill that makes The Exorcist a terrific movie, and one of those rare gems that can be admired for both ideas and craftsmanship. It's considered a classic for a reason, and should absolutely be included in the canons of not only the horror genre but the New Hollywood era of major studio art films.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Goodbut not great!,"Adapted for the screen by William Peter Blatty from his bestselling book about a young girl possessed by a demon, and directed by William Friedkin, The Exorcist is perhaps one of the most infamous scary movies of all time. When first released in the 70s, the film caused hysteria with people fainting in the theatres and requiring medical attention (the makers were accused of manipulating the audience with subliminal imagery). In the 80s, it was caught up in the 'Video Nasty' phenomenon, and when submitted for classification, was refused a release.The late 90s saw the film released uncut on DVD, and several versions have since been released, including 'The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen'. which saw the movie given a digital makeover, and 11 minutes of footage (excised from the film's original release) reinstated.But is the film worthy of its reputation as 'the scariest film of all time'? Well, Friedkin's movie is, without a doubt, an intense viewing experiencebut only in places. Linda Blair's portrayal of Regan, the girl who must undergo an exorcism after she shows all the signs of possession, is simply breathtaking and her scenes are truly amazing. Her disturbing transformation from sweet little girl to foul-mouthed, puke-spitting blasphemer is one of horror's defining moments and still has the power to shock.Dick Smith's wonderful make-up and Marcel Vercoutere's mechanical effects make Regan's possession seem only too real; they include the now-famous revolving head scene, the levitating body and, in 'The Version You've Never Seen', the amazingly creepy 'spiderwalk'.However, between these compelling 'shock' scenes, the film tends to drag and certain issues in the film are left unresolved. The prologue in Iraq, which adds very little to the story, lasts way too long. How or why Regan comes to be possessed, and exactly how this is connected to the opening moments, is vague at best. Scenes involving the desecration of a church, a silver necklace and a small clay statue require further explanation to be understood.The Exorcist is a film that any self-respecting horror fan should see. It is a classy production, with solid performances and lovely cinematography. The film's influence on horror cinema has ensured it has a well deserved place in movie history. Whether or not it deserves the all of the praise that has been heaped upon it is another matter.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Psychological Horror Movie Ever,"Like the title says this is hands down the best psychological horror movie ever.Beyond wayward slasher and gore films that while fun and give us the willies, even farther than internet beheadings, one can find in The Exorcist, scenes of unspeakable depravity, irreligiousness, and unsettling disturbing originality that will give the believer and non-believer alike insomnia.If you want fun and modern, watch The Terrifier.

A horror masterpiece,"A strangely relatable and incredibly human account of a priest struggling with his faith. A little girl left vulnerable by her entourage, absent father and busy actress mother. The intense and terrifying journey of a mother desperately trying to save her child.This story explores the mere idea of faith and exposes the effects of its absence. It's honest about the feelings of frustration we can feel at times, even as believers. The movie doesn't hold your hand, but instead completely submerges you into the story. The atmosphere is unique and not something I have ever experienced in any movie since. It keeps you on your toes, even decades later.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pea soup spewing antics!,"Oh, sigh! What a waste of my time! What an absolute freakin' waste of time. If ever there was a movie that tried to be scary- this is the one that goes home with the prize.Here's the plot- A little girl is possessed by the devil, and a priest tries to save her.Well, big deal!I admit, it does have one cool special effect (the writing ""HELP ME"" on her stomach)but overall this movie is just using the same old tiresome plot of a posessed human being. The most laughable scene is when she stabs herself in the hoodads repeatedly screaming ""Let Jesus **** you!"" is just plain stupid. All this movie shows is a director's attempt at trying to make a creepy movie. And Captain Howdy? Jeez! What a poor assed choice for a name for the devil! The idea of a profanity belching, pea soup spewing youngster just made ME want to projectile vomit! If you want a genuine fright fest see The Omen or Stigmata. This movie is a poor excuse to make a movie in which someone can swear a lot, be extremely horny, and attatch nylon strings to things to give them the appearence of flying about the room.This movie royally sucked, and when the Director's Cut came out, I thought, ""Oh joy! More scenes to laugh at!"" and there were, such as Linda Blair crabwalking down the stairs- how incredibly poxy that was!Anyway, I'm giving this movie MINUS10/10!",,Anonymous,Horror
Mechanically engineered for scares,"Young daughter of a famous actress demonstrates such strange, violently self-inflicted behavior that her mother is eventually told about the Catholic practice of Exorcism. Some audiences start giggling during ""The Exorcist"" right about the time Linda Blair's bed starts shaking, an understandable response since the film's shocks are occasionally outlandish, and the possessed girl's mother curses as much as the demon! The film is intense (sometimes glumly or heavily so) and also very scary (battering the viewer with graphic obscenities), yet there is art in the way director William Friedkin shaped William Peter Blatty's story, and many scenes are now classics: a haunting shot of Regan's scarred face overlapping the arrival of Father Merrin; Regan being promised a nice day out on her birthday, instead overhearing her mom on the phone trying to contact the estranged father, telling the secretary, ""He doesn't give a s**t!"" ""The Exorcist"" is definitely a horror movie, but it's also a psychological suspense story; if viewers do laugh at the freaky moments, that's because the shocks are engineered mechanically--they provoke either fright or nervous laughter (and in a crowded movie-house, reactions can go either way). The extra scenes included on ""The Version You've Never Seen"" were long overdue, however they do not add nor detract from the original product (although I found the ""ghostly apparitions"" a distraction). The expanded ending is fun for those who know the original by heart, but for the uninitiated viewer I would stick with the '73 goods. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still one of the scariest films of all time,"The Exorcist is an errie, brutal, and terrifying horror film that might just be the scariest of it's kind. The menacing atmosphere of this film is expertly crafted, as is the pacing, and the film slowly gets more horrifying and blaspehmous as it goes on.The story of the film is complex and riveting, pulling you into the drama the characters face while also offering up some surprisingly uplifting symbolism concerning the loss of faith and how it can be regained.The scare sequences in this film are nightmarish and unforgettable, with the special effects still conveying monstrous shocks decades after the films release.The sound design and visuals utterly spine chilling. Mercedes Mcambridge's menacing voice, as well as the brutal, bone chilling sound effects of Regan's body being violently mutilated, are both enough to make even the hardiest viewer's skin crawl.The acting is also phenomenal from every character, including all of the side characters, and you truly feel for all of them as the movie's titular demon wreaks havoc upon their lives.Overall, The Exorcist is a film every aspring horror fan must see and remains one of the most freightening stories ever filmed.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sometimes things just don't live up to your expectations,"I first saw ""The Exorcist"" twenty-five years after its first release and now once again fifty years after it first hit cinema screens. In many ways the film has aged well because all of the action takes place in a bubble. It would make for a good stage production given how much happens in a single room. And yet at this distance from the original furore it's clear that it falls short in many areas.The key problem is that the story doesn't really have a narrative or a great deal of internal logic. Whole sequences could be edited out without any impact on our understanding because, well, there's not much to understand. All we have is the high concept: girl gets possessed by The Devil, nobody believes it and then a lengthy exorcism takes place.Speaking of the exorcism this is very much the highlight. It's a lengthy, intense and unrelenting end to the movie where graphic makeup and special effects combine horribly. Up until this point there's a great deal of filler but when those priests go into battle armed with little more than faith and holy water - well that's when s**t gets real.It's a commanding finale but the rest of the movie is becalmed. There's a knowledge that the storm is coming, the clash of good and evil, but more than that there's the waiting for key moments that are part of cinema history. I'm thinking of the classic shot of Max von Sydow captured in foggy silhouette, the moment where Linda Blair spider walks down the stairs and the sinister sound of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells (even though this barely features in the film).These key moments that exist in our cultural memory make ""The Exorcist"" worth seeing and really it's not a bad film. But it's not exactly a good film. I'm not even sure that it is a film given how many elements are lacking (a good story, character arcs, meaningful dialogue etc). But it is relentless in realising the weird vision of William Friedkin even though I think that he was a pretty average director. Change my mind if you can!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underestimated,This film is underestimated in my opinion. Nowadays CGI has taken up so much space in films that films like the exorcist are considered outdated. And let's not talk about jump scares.

Tubular Bells,"By the time I was old enough to see 18 rated films. The Exorcist was not available on home video in Britain as the censors would not give it a certification.I eventually saw a special edition of the film and re-watched the original version more recently.William Friedkin has effectively made an art house horror film. It is leisurely paced and the exorcism part only plays a small part right at the end of the movie.The film begins at an archaeological dig in northern Iraq. Catholic priest Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) finds a representation of the devil.In Washington DC. Actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is shooting her latest film. Her bright and normal 12 year old daughter Regan (Linda Blair) suddenly starts to display disturbing behaviour. Chris consults doctors and psychiatrists who cannot comprehend her increasingly erratic and bizarre behaviour. It includes mouthing obscenities or her bed violently shaking.When the drunken director of Chris's film dies by falling out of Regan's bedroom with his neck twisted, detective Kinderman (Lee J Cobb) investigates.In desperation, Chris consults Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller.) He is a young brooding Jesuit priest who studied psychology. He is also having a crisis of faith as he was not there for the death of his elderly Greek mother.Father Karras is shocked to see Regan's condition and believes she is possessed. The church puts him in touch with Father Merrin who has performed an exorcism before in Africa, something that almost killed him.Over 45 years later the antics of Regan now look less disturbing. I can imagine audiences would be shocked when the movie was first released. Even more bizarre was the furore that Linda Blair's demonic voice was dubbed. She was 14 years old during the making of the film, it looks obvious that the possessed voice is not hers.The film has a languid pace, it does seem an age before the exorcism takes place. When the exorcism takes place it is both potent and shocking. The performances from both Von Sydow and Miller is intense as they shout: 'The power of Christ compels you.'I found on second viewing that The Exorcist works better if you look at it as the story of Father Karras. His torment, his crisis of faith, his visions regarding his mother coming out of those subway steps. The movie benefits greatly in the special edition when both priests have a discussion as to why such a young girl was chosen by the devil to be possessed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliance with genius,"Ingmar Bergman's ""Cries and Whispers"" and William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" are two films that explore the human soul and its weather. Both films force viewers to confront the reality of human suffering and question the faith and death within their families. Bergman's film explores love and conflict within a woman dying of cancer, asking important questions about faith and death. Friedkin's film, ""The Exorcist,"" follows a twelve-year-old girl with a severe neurological disorder or an evil spirit. Both films challenge the audience to look inside and experience horror, but their differences lie in their craftsmanship and the exploration of faith and death. ""The Exorcist"" is a powerful film that offers escapism, causing us to feel shock, horror, nausea, fear, and hope. It is one of the most powerful movies ever made, affecting us deeply. The movie doesn't rest on the screen, but rather, it is a frontal assault, causing us to feel the emotional experience of the characters. This powerful film is one of the most powerful escapism opportunities, as it allows us to question and experience the implications of the story without escaping it. ""The Exorcist"" is a highly acclaimed film that transcends the genre of terror, horror, and the supernatural. It surpasses ambitious efforts like Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" and Carl Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc."" The film is a triumph of special effects, containing brutal shocks and obscenities. The film's special effects are impressive, and the film never fails to leave viewers convinced. The special effects are particularly impressive, with the little girl being possessed by disgusting spirits and the bed banging and furniture flying. The film received an R rating, which is surprising given its lack of an X rating. Overall, ""The Exorcist"" is a testament to the power of film in influencing our perceptions and emotions. The performances in this movie are appropriate and effective. Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of the possessed girl's mother is particularly relatable, as she feels frustrated by doctors discussing brain lesions. Linda Blair's portrayal of the little girl is also a powerful portrayal. Jason Miller's portrayal of the young Jesuit is both tortured and intelligent. The Exorcist, a deeply Catholic film, has been a profitable venture for Warner Brothers for forty years. It follows Polanski's Rosemary's Baby (1968) in focusing on demonic possession, but William Peter Blatty's novel, based on fact, dropped the humor found in his previous work. The deeply Catholic movie credits a battery of Jesuit advisers and is at the opposite end of the spectrum from Jack Clayton's The Innocents in its depiction of manifest evil. The film features a devil that vomits, urinates, masturbates, explodes with obscenities, and desecrates the image of the Virgin. The film's haunting prologue set in northern Iraq features the elderly Father Merrin (Max von Sydow), a Jesuit experienced in exorcism, confronting an ancient evil spirit at an archaeological dig outside Mosul, an area now controlled by Isis. The film's evil may be of the kind Hannah Arendt characterised as banal, but stands in stark contrast to the romantic Manichaean conflict in the mythic contexts of Peter Jackson's Tolkien films and the Harry Potter stories.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Arguably the greatest horror film of all time,"I don't know enough about films to write an in-depth review. But I know an artistic triumph when I see one, and The Exorcist is an artistic triumph. Seriously. It's one of the few films that I truly believe belongs in museums.I need to address the superlatives attached to this film. Is it the best horror movie ever made? In my opinion, no. That honor goes to The Thing. Is it the greatest horror movie ever made? Like my title says, that's quite possible. Again, in my opinion. I do know that very few films in the past fifty or sixty years can claim to have had such an impact on the culture around them.Is it the scariest movie ever made? That's an interesting one. See, everyone finds different things scary. There are people who don't think The Exorcist is frightening in the slightest, and there are people who refuse to watch it due to how much it scares them. The first time I watched it (which was quite recently; I know, late to the party. As usual), I found it rather frightening, but nothing that traumatized me afterwards or anything like that. But the second time I watched it, which was just now, I realized something. Or rather, I felt something. I don't know how, but The Exorcist manages to tap into some strange kind of primal fear that all humans have that I genuinely believe has existed since animals were capable of feeling fear. I don't know what that fear is, I don't know how to describe how it feels, I don't even know if I'm right about this. All I know is that when I was watching it, I became aware of this feeling of primeval terror coming from somewhere deep, deep down. And no movie I've ever watched has done that.So you know what? I think I convinced myself. The Exorcist is, indeed, the greatest horror movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

So much more than just another 'ghost-train' adventure.,"A young girl from Georgetown is possessed by an evil entity and her only hope is a priest who has lost his calling.The Exorcist will mostly be remembered for its shocking possession scenes and horrific special effects.But Friedkin's film is so much more than just another 'ghost-train' adventure. Indeed in many ways it's a more interesting film if you take away the most memorable scenes...as strange as that sounds.For me the most interesting aspect of the film is the journey that it's characters take. The Catholic priest who has lost his faith in both his God and in life is forced to confront everything he believes in as his own mother loses health and he is brought in to help the young girl.The relationship between the excellent Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair is so sweet and believable at the beginning, which only makes you care about them more as the darkness creeps in.The way that the film takes it's time to establish its characters may disappoint people who want a 'shock-fest.' But for those who are more interested in a timeless horror story with memorable characters and moments, The Exorcist is truly one of the best there is.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Souper Thriller,"This horror film about a girl possessed by the devil became a box office blockbuster. The acting is pretty good and Friedkin creates a chilling atmosphere. However, the story is quite silly. It is not so much a horror film as an exercise in gross effects, with pea soup playing a prominent role. In fact, some of Blair's antics are more comical than scary. The expository scenes are not very interesting, and the prologue in Iraq, while well filmed, does not fit in with the rest of the film. The plot has some holes, and even if one accepts the premise of possession, there is no logic to someone turning her head 360 degrees without dying. It's simply cheap thrills.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still Shocking After All These Years,"Few movies shocked people like this one when it came out. Almost 35 years later, it will still shock you if you've never seen it. It's definitely recommended, but beware of some very gross scenes, brutal language and a sordid and genuinely frightening story.The special effects still hold up. They don't look dated and they are just as creepy. The story starts a bit slowly, but once in kicks in, it's tough to put this DVD on pause. This is still an intense, repulsive and scary movie filled with memorable scenes as a demon takes control over a young girl's body.Two things bothered me in the film that probably don't upset most people: way too much usage of the Lord's name in vain - almost all by the girl's mother, played by Ellen Burstyn. The second - and I am not Catholic - is the pitiful portrayal of yet-another Hollwood weak priest. This priest is smokes, drinks, swears, steals, etc.. etc, and is a pitiful excuse for a cleric: just the kind filmmakers love to portray. One priest - get this - says his idea of heaven is to be a nightclub performer for eternity and have everyone like him. Obviously, people who makes films have NO clue about ""religion."" Not a single clue. But, this was '70: the most irreverent film-making period in our history, so it's no surprise.However - to its credit - the film does an excellent job of convincing even the most ardent atheist that demons do exist, that there really is a devil, and that he is not to be taken lightly. It's no joke, and the shock value of this film might have gotten some people to start thinking there is something to all this ""spiritual stuff.""Whatever your theology, or lack of it, this movie is one you will never forget. It is beyond anything seen before it or since. I recommend the DVD that advertises this as ""The Exorist: The version you've never seen."" That's the best and most complete version of this terrifying film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Steaming Pile of Demon Puke,"A ridiculous and laughable ""horror"" film about demonic possession. ""The Exorcist"" is simply terrible. William Friedkin directed with an iron fist, and there isn't the least shade of subtlety to this story. You may feel assaulted, but you won't be scared.Poor Ellen Burstyn has to wade her way through this crap in the thankless role of mother to Linda Blair's possessed daughter. The two actresses are quite effective in the film's early scenes, when the possession has yet to fully take hold, and these scenes are the creepiest in the movie. But once Blair is relegated to the bedroom, strapped down to the bed and bedecked with caked-on prosthetics, this movie gives up all claims to seriousness and becomes a procession of shameless shock moments. Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow wander around and intone imperiously as the two priests assigned to the exorcism, and Mercedes McCambridge gives the film's most lively performance as the demon's voice.Disgustingly, Friedkin actually claimed that this film was religiously significant, a ruse that worked, since it became a blockbuster. Times haven't changed. Religious fanatics turned Mel Gibson's bloodbath, ""The Passion of the Christ,"" into a cultural phenomenon, and they've done the same to this. If religiously-themed films have taught us anything, it's that religious people certainly do like their Sunday school messages to come packaged in pain and suffering.Grade: D",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't take it too personally,"I had great anxiety going to this film because I had heard so much about it. I was somewhat justified. I don't know when I've felt quite as uncomfortable in a movie theater. The interesting thing was that I didn't buy into any of the supernatural elements in it. I don't personally believe in a Dante like hell where devils take over our souls and can spin their heads around and burn us for eternity. Yet, the makeup on this young girl, the use of the most base profanity, the special effects, that rumbling voice, hissing, the fog, masterful. The crude, sacrilegious displays were really over the top. This is a truly frightening experience from beginning to end. The first time I saw the face of Regan, I nearly left the theater. Then my curiosity was piqued by images of ancient horrors. I am not squeamish when it comes to movies. I was ready for the vomit. But I guess I have to ask myself, ""How much can you put up with?""

"Well, there's always somebody........","I saw The Exorcist when it first came out. I didn't really like it and really didn't want to see it again, but when I heard that there was a definitive cut with eleven additional minutes, the temptation was too great. I had to see it again to see if I thought differently about it. And I wanted to see Lee J. Cobb in particular, one of my favorite actors (the line about John Garfield in his first scene is ironic, as both of them were part of the Group Theatre).Sorry. I gave it my best shot. I don't think it's much of a classic.Friedkin certainly did a good job, and the story was interesting. The graphic nature of the film and the language didn't really bother me as it did others.Burstyn is fantastic as she always is, but Blair is remarkable, and that's my real problem with this movie. Anyone who didn't let their child play the role of Megan has my full respect. The fact that Blair's parents let her do this movie was simply unconscionable. A teenager has no maturity to handle what she is asked to handle here, and it should not have been a surprise that her childhood was destroyed as a result. It is no wonder that her career became a non-career. No one was going to offer her a role as a 'normal' girl. She is still beautiful, and deserves another chance to show what she is truly capable of as an actress, but I don't think anyone has the guts to do that in Hollywood today.I can't say that I wasted my time watching this, but I'm not likely to want to see it again.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, But A Little Dated","This is the first time I'd seen the Exorcist and as anyone who is a fan of movies knows. This is considered by many to be not just one of the greatest horror movies of all time, but one of the greatest movies of all time period. In terms of pure film making and pushing boundaries of the culture it was made in there are a lot of things to be admired. However the one thing that the Exorcist wasn't in my opinion was scary. Now since fear is a completely emotional reaction it's impossible to say with 100% what is or is not scary. So I'm sure that someone else was shaking in their seat watching this. However that person isn't me. I would go as far as to say that the ""HORROR/SUPERNATURAL"" scenes in this movie range from okay to hilariously meme worthy. I suppose that this is the consequence of when your pushing boundaries. Anyone who looks into the history of this film and the media circus that surrounded it upon it's release will understand that this movie triggered a lot of people at a time in American history when belief in Religion and cultural definitions of what is moral, funny, and fit to show on screen were completely different to how it is now. So when watching this movie I had to have two minds about it, I think back to how a 1973 American would react to this, and I imagine a person throwing up or walking out offended and traumatized by what they had just seen while clutching their pearls. However from a modern stand point those same scenes come off as something an edge lord kid would be screaming at you over Xbox live from his moms basement, or what some internet troll would be spamming to people on social media. I also found the ending to be a big What? moment as well, didn't really get the point if even their was a point to get. There were many moments were I genuinely was invested which is do credit to the character drama and the actors performances as well as the directing which is excellently done. I quiet enjoyed this movie despite its flaws and would defiantly recommend it to everyone to watch at least once. Even if you don't find it that scary, it's very entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

True Horror,"With modern horror films lacking creativity and relying on jump scares, The Exorcist is a great reminder of what the genre is all about. The film takes you on a journey, making you feel as if you are being haunted, in the room with everyone else. The pacing and scene changes make it feel that you are living this nightmare, with every moment being torture. The cast encompass their roles perfectly and Linda Blair is a particular stand-out, as the child star sends chills down your spine and makes it hard to look at the screen. The fear did not come just because someone looked creepy, the fear comes from the unnerving performance, the ghoulish effects, and the gut wrenching story come together to evoke terror from start to finish. Hailed as one of the greatest horror films, the Exorcist, at nearly 50 years old, delivers true fear and horror in still unique and unsettling ways.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not Scary.. At Least For Me,"I think it really depends on who you are and what your beliefs are in regards to religion/demonic possession etc. How easily you're offended or scared by obscene language/shocking or disgusting visuals. The major themes, the idea of pure evil corrupting the innocence of a child, struggling with faith and sacrifice etc. Then you might find this movie shocking/scaryI dunno, I know that when this was released in the early 70's all of the things I listed above were much more controversial topics, and feel that to a certain extent they were kind of floating around in society and in the minds of people attempting to individually grapple with these kind of issues in their own ways. To have all of this stuff thrown at you, would have been at the very least jarring and possibly horrifying, and at the worst personally terrifyingIf you're an atheist, that laughs at the superstitious/moralistic sensibilities of traditional society being offended, have grown up seeing truly disturbing stuff online and in books etc. Then chances are you're just gonna end up either bored, or laughing.The only thing I found even slightly creepy was the few glimpses of Pazuzu (the white faced devil) that you get when he flashes on the screen for a second or two.Good special effects, fine acting, decent direction, but if you're unable to connect with the subject matter then none of that will matter. It's like somebody making a horror movie about a jar of pickles; If you don't have an irrational phobia regarding pickles you won't find it frightening/shocking in the least.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This is a historical piece of cinema, which leaves no one indifferent","With everything that surrounds this movie, I'm quite surprised with what I found when I saw it. And I'm not talking about his blatant demonic possession scenes. It's a film with a very serious script, so much so that it not only considers the formalities and protocols within the Catholic Church, but also its approach to science and medicine. At all times we are facing a story that is supposed to be real and therefore, it's treated as such, with real characters, real dramas and real reactions, except for the protagonist, of course. This itself is part of how creepy the movie itself can be. The moments without a soundtrack give even more weight to a mature and raw story.It's indeed a terrifying film and very well done. There is really nothing negative. If I get meticulous, there are certain details of the sound editing and montage that annoy me a bit, but they are typical things of the cinema of those times, so it's understandable.This is a historical piece of cinema, which leaves no one indifferent, including non-religious people. It is definitely one of the best movies in the industry, of its genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Traumatizing,"What a great horror movie, at all times I was tense, and my trauma since childhood.It is the first time that I see it again after a little more than a decade, and something that seemed curious to me is that the soundtrack present in the film is non-existent, apart from the main soundtrack, that makes me think how great it is, since it does not need loud sounds to scare, much less screams that appear out of nowhere.The story seems great to me, innovative at the time and terrifying, many scenes made me very tense, and the whole scenario is very scary. Several moments make me think that the performance of the protagonist should be highlighted, being a girl playing a role and a story of such magnitude.A great film of the horror genre, which continues and will continue to traumatize many more.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

That's not my mother's name!,"When a placid teen turns demonic, her mother desperately searches for a solution until only one option is left.Big, sensational horror that plumbs the depths in a long run time. Plenty of fine performances, and iconic moments and scenes. The best elements are in the sound design and music, which are well mixed and often experimental. The director also uses several fleeting visual inserts that suggest an unspeakable otherworld. The main emphasis is on real effects combined with a determination to shock, which makes for an obvious influence on subsequent movie-making but dates the original quite a bit.Storywise, the problem I have is that we go through the looking glass at random. Early on, there's the scratching in the attic, the shaking of the bed, but why? Why this family, this girl? And how? There doesn't have to be an elaborate backstory or mythology - just certain indicators of where it comes from, how it got here, but they're absent.Instead, great effort is put into a futile quest by reasoned experts for a solution - fair enough, but that also adds length to the story without much pay off, and I couldn't help feeling it would have been done just as well with a relatively brief montage. Plus we get the gratuitous disturbance of an accusation of Nazism, which lays a false trail. Does the problem lie with the mother, her choice in men, her inability to provide a stable family? These issues are raised, but have no bearing on the outcome. In fact, if you explored this story Rashomon style, with the characters each giving their version of events, the mother mightn't come off that well!Where this movie does go deep is in the story of the men, the most important being the two exorcists, Karras and Merrin, but there are also the absent husband, the boozy director with a romantic interest, the obedient manservant, and the detective. All past their prime.The stand out character is Merrin, who drives an opening scene that does actually carry the myth of the story. But all this remains neglected until very late on, when we come to the highly charged confrontation. Now that's worth waiting for! In the end, we're invited to consider the role of the Lamb of God. Plus there's a significant kiss, which is probably what the writer was driving at all along - in that case, it's a creakingly old-fashioned story.I've seen this a few times and do appreciate the elements of quality, and why it made such a splash, but it's not a great horror. I suspect the audience for which it really hits home is religious, with a ready made mythos and a plan of spiritual campaign.Overall: It's been great, but kindly undo these straps.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A unique horror masterpiece that remains terrifying to date,"The Exorcist is a well-constructed horror movie in many aspects that make it a worthy movie of this genre. It has a well-developed script and a good production. Apart from the good performances, the effects that were very subtle, I also give points in favor for the soundtrack and its strange sounds that generate a gloomy atmosphere and that also includes editing and editing. Linda Blair also gets a lot of credit for acting and all that makeup that was very convincing. In conclusion, The Exorcist is one of the best horror movies and cinema in general that have been made due to its direction, production, etc. It's been said many times before, but it's because to this day, it's still creepy and still fresh, because it's unique because it has a kind of unique style that hasn't been seen in any other exorcism movie. For all that said, my final rating for this movie is a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most well made movies ever made.,"The Exorcist was a movie that I had been interested in seeing since i was in middle school. I was rather intrigued about what is considered to be the scariest movie of all time. Having recently seen it for the first time, I can say that it's probably not exactly scary in terms of modern horror movies, but I knew that going into it. Older horror movies favored slow build-up and dread over jump scares. They work better for repeat viewings, versus getting jump scared once and not even flinching on the second viewing.Despite the creepy elements, what really stood out to me about the movie was the sheer craftsmanship of the whole thing. This is one of the best made movies I have ever seen. The acting is phenomenal, particularly from Linda Blair as Regan. The make-up done on her is iconic. The effects still hold up for the most part. The atmosphere is top notch, you always feel that something is off,even in the calmer moments. The only issue I feel worth mentioning for someone who hasn't seen it is there are quite a few slow scenes of people talking, but even then the actors are giving such good performances it hardly matter.The Exorcist is considered by many to be the scariest movie of all time, and if it's not quite that, it definitely stands as one of the best made scary movies ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Exorcist stands firmly among the greatest films ever made.,"The Exorcist is widely regarded to be the scariest movie of all time. Personally, I would put it a little differently. Instead of calling it the scariest movie of all time, I think that it would be more accurate to say that it's the best horror movie of all time. These may be just two different ways of saying the same thing, but I think that there is a notable difference.I just watched The Exorcist again, and I experienced the nervousness and tension and fear that it was meant to cause and I jumped a few times, but I've watched several other horror movies that have caused those same feelings  The Shining, Pet Sematary, The Sixth Sense to a certain extent, even the remake of The House on Haunted Hill had a few quality scares. But I think that the thing that sets The Exorcist apart is that everything was just done right. The acting was great, the story was unique and well presented, the gruesome special effects were skillfully crafted, even the gore and the sickening profanity were put into the film with good reason and with good results. It's so rare to see a horror movie come along (and it gets rarer and rarer as time goes on) that is actually worth watching, and when one comes along that is absolutely ground-breaking, like The Exorcist, then it's a huge cinematic event.The Exorcist is just as timeless as horror films get, and it should be noted for its style and its effectiveness.  There have been so many imitations of this film that have popped up over the years (which is to be expected, because it created so many possibilities), but none of them, not even any of the sequels, even come close to the greatness of the original. Not only is it original and unique, but it also contained some stunning performances, particularly on the part of Linda Blair as Regan, the 12-year-old girl who was the subject of the exorcism. There were some frankly shocking things that she did for the film, and the brilliant special effects and make-up added to that to make Regan's possession amazingly realistic, which is probably the most remarkable thing about the film.Another thing that was done especially well in The Exorcist was the sound effects. Probably one of the main reasons that the movie is so scary is because it is so unexpected and therefore so unsettling to hear some of those noises come from a little girl. William Friedkin's skillful but relentless directing style clearly played a large part in the convincingness of the final outcome, which stands as one of the definitive films in cinematic history.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Scary? Don't make me LAUGH.,"This movie is downright boring and not scary at all. What's the use of the opening sequence when it has nothing to do with the rest of the story except introduce the priest. That is already a waste of time and film.Secondly I though the Demon would be very powerful and instead, the possessed Regan is easily confined in a room. C'mon you can do better than spit, curse, levitate the bed and the rest of those petty tricks. All the special effect is not disturbing at all, although the neck sequence is fairly amusing. Thirdly, many of the scenes don't fit into the overall plot at all. I can't believe it is still on the Top 250 list. If I have it my way, I'll reclassify this as a soap drama. Truly, The Exorcist didn't stand the test of time.I whole heartedly recommend other much higher quality horror films like Ringu, The Shining, Alien, and The Thing than this crap.

THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE YOU WILL EVER WATCH!!!!!,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF THE EXORCISTThis is by far my favorite movie I have ever seen, and I wasn't even alive in the 1900's. Now of course if you watch it now you will think it isn't scary at all because there are way more scarier things nowadays. But if you watched it back then you would have definitely been scared, because not a lot of things were scarier than this movie. I mean it was rated the best horror movie of all time and still is because it is a classic. So if you like classic horror movies, this movie is totally for you. Trust me. The actors did a really good job, and the makeup artist made the demon look very creepy. Even though the movie itself isn't scary, the concept is scary. There isn't really any horror movies that scare me even if it does have jumpscares (like I won't have nightmares or anything), but what makes a good horror movie is if the plot is good, the actors do great, and the concept is scary. And the concept for the exorcist is definitely scary. I mean it's nothing you haven't seen before if you have watched exorcism movies, but you won't waste your time watching this movie. I certainty didn't. After all, this movie introduced exorcism to the big screen (just saying). I also can't wait to read the book. Shoutout to William Peter Blatty for making this movie happen. And also a shoutout to all the directors who made a masterpiece of a horror film. I will watch this time and time again. In conclusion, I give this movie a 10/10 stars.Check out my review for The Exorcist: Believer if you liked this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lives up to the hype,"Unfortunately, my taste in horror movies is pretty vanilla, and that's made clear by my two all-time favourites from the genre. For both, I've been lucky enough to see them in a cinema during 2022, with the big screen and proper sound-system making them even better than I'd remembered. The first of those 5-star horror movies was 1980's The Shining, a few months back, and the second - seen tonight - was The Exorcist. It's not saying anything new to declare either as essentially perfect horror movies, but here we are. And what can I say - they've earned their stellar reputations.From the eerie opening scenes of The Exorcist to the relentless climax, the film is practically flawless for its entire runtime. I think the pace does feel deliberately slow at points, but it's always moving forward at a steady rate. The fact the main plot takes a while to kick off doesn't hurt the movie (it serves the characters better). Also, the horror scenes prior to the climax are often very sudden and end abruptly. This serves to make the extended exorcism near the film's end feel all the more impactful and intense, as the film's one ""big"" horror sequence. The rest of the film is more concerned with suspense, punctuated with brief bursts of shocking horror.The cast all do amazing work, I love the sparse use of music, all the special effects have aged flawlessly (this movie is almost 50 years old!), and the shocking scenes are still genuinely shocking. There are plenty of horror movies that were considered shocking and alarming on release that feel a little tame today (even something like Psycho, in all honesty), but The Exorcist is one of the earliest horror films that hasn't lost any of its power. Even if you know what's coming, the impact is still there, and the terror of it all is still palpable.William Friedkin's had an interesting career, and has made numerous classics across a variety of genres. I think The Exorcist might be my favourite of all his films I've seen, and I'm shocked by how well it holds up. It's a patient film that takes its time, yet does so with purpose and without wasting any of its runtime. Again, nothing shocking about another person saying The Exorcist is an amazing horror movie, but what else can I do? It really is that good.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disgusting,"My wife and I went to see this movie when we were still single and in college. She fainted about a third of the way through it and we had to leave. It was just as well, I had given that idea some thought myself before she finally decided she'd had enough. This movie was so bad, it doesn't even deserve a rating. This is another example of a good story idea, but they went just a little bit too far to get the message home. Why did that little girl have to pee on the rug after telling that astronaut ""You're going to die up there""? The statement in and of itself was chilling enough. Wetting the rug was a bit of overkill. In fact, it made it look comical and spoiled the effect in my opinion. We left when poor little Regan was doing sit-ups on her bed at turbo speed and sprouting profanities in a voice about six octaves lower than her normal voice. I really think that the only reason they made this movie was to see how far they could push the envelope. Like many seventies movies, I think it was made for shock value. Too bad. The premise for the story was pretty good. Just way too much overkill.",,Anonymous,Horror
Scary on a psychological level,"I have seen this movie two times. The first time six years ago when I was sixteen years old. I had nightmares for a week. I had only heard that it was scary and didn't know anything else about it (being Swedish, I of course knew that Max von Sydow had a part in it), so it *did* scare me. It isn't scary in the special effects 'body-parts are flying'-kind of way or anything, it's scary on a psychological level which is a thing I don't think people who say that this isn't a scary movie can see. They obviously wants more blood and maimed bodies. This is horror with *class*. More of a Silence of the Lambs-""scariness"".However, I have now seen it a second time and I have to say that I don't find it as scary as I did when I was sixteen. But it is still a great movie and didn't William Peter Blatty say that he based his book on an article he had read as a student about an exorcism that the Catholic church *had* allowed for a young boy. I don't know if that's true, but if the Catholic church allows an exorcism then it must be... serious.Great and intense movie. I give it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Exorcist,"As horror films go, this has got to be one of the best I've ever seen. Ellen Burstyn is great as the actress whose young daughter ""Regan"" (Linda Blair) goes from being a charming, outgoing, teenage girl into the epitome of a demon possessed. Once every scientific and medical approach has been exhausted, the truly desperate mother turns to the priesthood - hoping maybe they can save the girl? It was certainly ground-breaking at the time: the fairly (though only occasional) graphic violence, the provocatively vile language - especially potent when it emanates from such young lips; the effective make up and green slime effects - they have all stood the test of time in away that many of it's contemporaries have struggled with. The pace is perfect (though I found the director's cut took way too long to become interesting, even if it did show us some of the beautiful treasures of Northern Iraq); there is a little well placed humour and the measured, almost stately contributions of Max von Sydow - always a master of the"" less is more"" style of performance - really work wonderfully, building to a culmination that has you on the edge of your seat. Lee J. Cobb also adds a certainly mysterious quality to the story, too - a policeman investigating the death of one of the characters from earlier on; but a man who seems to know a great deal more about what is actually going on than he ever leads anyone to believe. The dialogue is quite sparing, much is left to the effective visuals, the soundtrack and - best of all - to our own anticipation and imagination. Looks great on a big screen - and is certainly still well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

For an early 70s horror film the effects are exceptional, but the story just isn't that scary and none of the film's images came back to play games with my mind.I could easily have fallen asleep to this one, but wish I'd seen it in my teens when it would have had more impact.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still. Holds. Up.,"The Exorcist certainly has a reputation. From being protested by the Catholic church to making people pass out in the cinema during its theatrical run, it's one of the godfathers of controversial horror. The difficulty with these kinds of films is that they run the risk of becoming comedic with age. Sometimes, as audience expectations and standards shift, the original experience of watching a movie like this with fresh 70's eyes will be lost forever. Also, many films since The Exorcist have in some way, re-used or payed homage to iconic elements of the movie. This too can make it hard to go back to the source material of all this praise and ripping-off; running the risk of being underwhelmed.The narrative's setup seems simple, an actress thinks her daughter is possessed by a demon. A priest who doubts her claims is tasked with finding out. Despite the stripped-down story, there is so much time spent really getting to know all the characters involved that the emotional weight of the movie is carried, not by frights, but by the nuanced performances of the actors and the personal struggles of their characters. While this is The Exorcist's strength, it's also a weakness. There's a distractingly long and vague buildup which attempts to set up exactly what and why the events that take place are occurring...but it really only succeeds in muddying the water of what should be a crystal clear story.This blip aside, The Exorcist is a masterfully crafted film. It kicks off quaintly enough at first, tricking the modern viewer into thinking that any shocks to come will be antique scares from a simpler time. Oh boy. There are some downright uncomfortable moments here that go further than many current horror films will even dare to go. This ramp up gets pretty intense; though, as feared, the iconic moments don't always hold up very well (head spinning and spider walking, I'm looking at you). Despite slight 70s cheese moments, there's enough meat on these bones that have stood the test of time. The acting is great, the characters are interesting, the story is engrossing and sometimes surprising, the horror is chilling and shocking, and the cinematography is sublime. I'm always amazed at just how great the composition and lighting in this film is. It appeals to horror fiends and movie buffs but has retained enough of its shock value over the years to still alienate most everyone else.Despite the Catholic church's boycott of the movie when it was initially released, I found the movie to be unexpectedly reverent of the church's beliefs. The priests are portrayed as flawed individuals, some have doubts, some drink, some gamble, but overall they all have good hearts and a desire to change the world for the better. They are the flawed heroes, not the villains. Though it's pretty understandable that the church would want to avoid being the hero of a work of art so shocking and potentially offensive, the movie really ends up being great PR for them amongst the horror set...a group often passed over by the church. That aside, there's some pretty extreme language, visuals, and legitimately horrifying occurrences, despite the age gap. So, with that in mind, the boycott makes a bit more sense.Should You See the Exorcist?By and large, this movie HOLDS UP. If you are a fan of classic, slow-burn horror in general, you have to see this. It hasn't aged perfectly but it's fair to say that this is still one of the scariest movies of all time. If horror isn't your thing, you probably want to avoid this one. It may be one of several pinnacles of the genre for fans, but it's not a great entry point if you don't consider yourself part of that community.-Josh Evans",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sleep Deprivation Mode Activated,"I haven't got around watching this horror classic for a long time, hailed as one of the greatest of the genre and reportedly causing audiences to faint and vomit! (yucky) I decided to finally check it out on a midnight (How appropriate..), and I have to admit, it wasn't that scary for me! Still made me nervous though.The movie opens in the most unexpected of places, Iraq, but Friedkins direction gives off this eerie and daunting vibe which never leaves throughout the entire movie. The characters are well developed and the performances are really solid, especially Ellen Burstyn whose performance as the increasing distraught mother is everything I could ask for but lets not forget Linda Blair, who really sells it as the possessed daughter who increasingly says and does things that would put you on Santa's Naughty List (or worse...).It's always nice to see genuine buildup and suspense in a horror movie instead of cheap jump-scares that have been plaguing modern horror movies (We've been digging our own graves...). The scares, when they come are very effective and stays with you even for a long time. The FX are very impressive even to this day, I still wonder how they achieve that flying technique although I'm not too keen on the demons voice.Overall, a nail-bitting horror movie which keeps you on the edge of your seat until the tense and chaotic climax which genuinely made me agitated. I wont recommend this to everybody as some people might have more tingly bones than me and it can get quite slow at times with the padded scenes.

Interestingly Vulgar,"The year was 1973 ... the place Montreal, Quebec ... and the news was filled with talks about the newest horror film to hit the theaters ... The Exorcist! According to the news, due to health concern of theater goers, the theater had an ambulance stationed outside just in case anyone in the audience fainted, or had a heart attack, due to this being the scariest movie ever made ... and due to the public's reactions to the film during its premiere showing. The camera shows the ambulance sitting quietly in front of the theater, and the enormously long line of people waiting to get in to see the movie! We're talking a line that went clear around the block and ended about 12 feet in front of the line's beginning! How absolutely exciting! Fortunately, the movie was in English ... or was in fortunate, I still haven't decided. Anyhoots, the movie began with boredom that slowly evolved into ... how to put this ... SCREAMS of laughter! The scariest movie of all time was turned into a comedy, probably due to many of those in the audience not understanding a word of English! When the movie finally ended, and people were leaving the theater, those still standing in line to get in must have been totally confused by the comments of the people coming out of the theater ... due to the vulgar quotations and the screams of laughter. The No. 1 scariest movie was a comedy hit! Well, yesterday I found a copy of the movie at WalMart, for $ 4.00, and took it home. I wanted to see if it was as funny now, as it was in 1973. My opinion is that this movie became so famous due to the shocking vulgarity, and its disgusting sexual antics. It was pure shock! As for the acting. Linda Blair lost the chance at an Oscar nod due to the academy discovering that there was voice dubbings and mechanics involved in her performances. The real acting came from Ellen Burstyn and, in part, from Jason Miller. Ms. Burstyn was a perfect choice for her part, as were the rest of the cast, but Ms. Burstyn made the most of her part and made it her own! A scene that was not shown in theaters shows Regan coming down the stairs upside-down ... with a torso that was far too long to be hers! I'm not surprised that scene was originally tossed out ... however, it does add to the strangeness, as well as to the hilarity, of the film.This is not a DVD I will be watching again ... in that way, the movie is a failure ... unlike something like ""Deep Blue Sea"" or even ""Mama Mia""!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's aged badly,"Having seen 'The Exorcist' recently, and knowing beforehand how horrific it was supposed to be, I have to confess that I laughed all the way through. It has aged terribly in the last twenty-five years.  It is slow, loosely plotted and far too ""seventies"" for a nineties audience to really appreciate.  I'm sure that, at the time, it was a mould-breaking horror. Now it's just a relic that illustrates the sensibilities of a seventies audience and the censors.

An Unconvincing Demon Possession,"Aside from the intentionally disturbing nature of this film, I find this story about a ""possessed"" girl to be somewhat confused and half-baked. Well, what could I expect?The makers of The Exorcist certainly weren't aiming for plausibility here. No. Their goal was to gross the audience out like it had never been grossed out before and make a huge pile of money doing it. I'm sure we'd all agree that they succeeded very well on both counts.As far as Reagan's ""possession"" goes, I think it was a really screwy one and kinda wimpy, too.To begin with, since she seemed to be fortified with an incredible amount of physical power, this left me wondering why the hell she would allow herself to be confined, like a prisoner, to her own bedroom. I would think that whatever it was that was possessing her would be itching to go out on the town and, you know, turn a few heads around on Main Street, or something wickedly-fun like that. But none of this kinda thing happened. There were no aborted escape attempts, either.All-in-all, it was a kind of stupid ""demon"". Boring and unadventurous, if you ask me. But apparently Reagan did get out once (or did she?) to desecrate the virgin Mary icon in the church. And her desecration was so artistically done, too.

The masterpiece Friedkin always wanted that he had already made,"An old filmmaking maxim cites the best films as the ones where every cut, sound, and visual contributes to the whole. Nothing proves the truth of this more than the fact that many of those who first witnessed The Exorcist on its release back in 1973 are still instilled with anxiety and fear whenever it's shown on television today. The cleverness of the film is not just technical, however, as the script allows for many interpretations of the demon's intentions as well as the shady moralities of all those it haunts. You can see writer Blatty and director Friedkin's struggle with faith in the world weary priests and their horrific trials. And arguably its greatest achievement is to rejuvenate the faith of many despite the challenges it makes to believers; we witness some characters who were in doubt, fully regain their belief that God is good, a very stirring ordeal for those with faith, and an interesting question posed for those who are atheistic: are there things worth believing in, for the sake of protecting each other, even when we know they are based on factual inaccuracies?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Happy 50th,"It's Boxing Day and The Exorcist is 50 years old. It's not a Christmas movie, but that's the point, I need a break from all the festive cheer and what better way than to revisit a classic. We meet Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) looking a bit peaky on an archeological dig in Iraq. We're kept guessing, but it's clear he's found some things amongst all the dust and stone that make him uneasy. Cut to America, where actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) and her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) are about to have their world turned upside down, whilst Tubular Bells plays in the background. Father Karras (Jason Miller) is also a bit lost. Working as a psychiatrist for the church, keeping an eye on his elderly mother. He tells her he's fine, but he's clearly not. These are the cornerstones in a slow opening act. Horrors often like to set the pulse racing early on, but The Exorcist will ask for your patience. Chris is hearing noises in the loft though and Regan isn't sleeping well. That's just the start of it. As things get more extreme with Regan, regular psychiatry and modern medicine is ditched and Karras is called in. Only after Lieutenant Kinderman (Lee Cobb) has been snooping around though. I don't think it's much of a spoiler to divulge that Regan is possessed. The scenes in which she's flailing around on the bed, screaming and swearing are genuinely terrifying. Still 50 years on, but what makes The Exorcist great is not the effects with levitating children, it's the slow eerie building narrative weaved through the supporting cast. This is what drives it and makes you believe. For if you don't, well you've just got some freaky scenes with no substance. Karras isn't an exorcist, but he's convinced enough to go down the rabbit hole and call in Father Merrin. It's showtime and Max von Sydow is the guy you want in your corner. He not only looks every bit the demon slayer, but he nails the performance too. Make no mistake though, for all the great performances, Burstyn, Miller, this is Linda Blair's film. She might be caked in make up and if you're so inclined you could laugh at the absurdity of her role, but she's still brilliant. The sheer physicality of what's asked of her is pretty full on and although Friedkin is inventive with the camera, you still need the raw footage and Blair has it covered. Some people adore this film and I can see why, in many ways it's flawless, but it's foolish to say watching it 50 years on its not weakened a little. Only a little though. For the genre and the era it's a powerhouse production.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A dangerous mix of religion, superstition and movie monsters.","A dangerous mix of religion, superstition and movie monsters. If you're just in for a good scare this movie is perfect. But all I'm saying is don't take this movie to serious. I admit I'm not a religious guy, I don't mind religions, but this one brings it out in a very confusing way. For the first Exorcism is of course only superstition and movie fantasy, but the religious tie-ins in this movie may confuse you. Also you may have heard from people that this is based on a true story, now of course that is just to scare you a little extra. This movie is nothing but a pure horror movie which uses religious symbols and special effects to scare you. So take my advice when I tell you, don't take this to serious.Now as a horror film, this is brilliant. I'm pretty used to horror movies, and when it surrounds the supernatural it normally don't freak me out. This one did. If you're not used to horror films, don't watch this, you'll not be able to sleep for days. If you already is a fan of horror, I highly recommend it. Don't forget, it was this movie which for the first time presented the monster as a child. It was as creepy then as it is today, and it has became a horror phenomenon.The special effects in this movie is damned good for it's time. Honestly there are sequences I don't think we could have done better today.So if your squeamish stay away from this.

"Not a horror film, but a psychological thriller","The Exorcist is considered by many people, the most terrifying film of all time. I would disagree with that statement because I believe that this film is not a horror film, or at least not at this era. This is a thriller were the true horror comes with the building of tension and the thoughts you have after you have watched the film.There is only one scene in this movie were I was really frightened and that is in the spider-crawl scene. The rest of the movie is still terrifying, but you don't jump out of your seat, you just get immersed by the wonderful tension and cinematography.The acting is perfect. Every characters seems real and authentic with real worries and ambitions. I especially like Father Damien, who was played by Jason Miller (his first motion picture). He really gives the impression of a broken man that just wants to help.The special effects are out of this world, to this day, everything you see looks authentic. There is no part of the film were you go ""Oh that looks fake"". It shows how far practical effects can go.The tension is also magnificent, you can see Regan slowly get worse and her mother becoming more desperate as the movie continues. The exorcism scenes are chilling and make you feel uncomfortable.I especially love the ending of the film, which I will not spoil. I believe it is one of the best endings ever because of the shock factor.There is only one problem I can find with the film, that is the beginning. I do believe that the beginning is very disconnected from the rest of the movie and did not require that much screen time. The beginning gives you some very important information that you will need for later and does a tremendous job at showing, not telling. But it really doesn't feel like the exorcist. I just believe that there was a better way to integrate it to the story.Many online pages describe this film as the most terrifying film of all time. I wouldn't recommend seeing this film if you just want to get scared with your friends. This film is not the Conjuring (which is very good), it does not give you scares and make you scream.If you are going to watch this movie, please take your time with it and watch it with your full attention. I would recommend watching it alone to not get distracted. At first, you will believe that this movie is really not that scary, but as the days pass, you will find that this movie really frightens you after giving it some thought.Not a movie for everyone, but if you the movie is made for you... You will love it.P.S. I don't know why but I really love the tracking shots in the film, you can clearly notice in which character you should focus when they are introduced, in a crowd. I believe that is masterful directing.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I am older than this movie and a horror fun, but it never connected with me","I see gobs of 10 star reviews out there, but honestly this one gets a 6 out of 10 from me. I am older than this film, which gives me the right to judge it harshly.It absolutely is worth one watch as a classic and has some positives going for it. A great cast, and a story that is least out of the ordinary. The mood, special effects, and overall production values are very high for the time (and even now I prefer the practical effects over the silly digital craziness we often see in film).But for me the sum is not as great as the parts. It simply does not come together as a really compelling movie. It is not at all scary to me (and wasn't as a kid). It just falls a bit flat. It is fine as a sentimental favorite to pop on in October if I can stream it for no extra cost, but it certainly is not one I would have in my collection.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not half as good as the ratings would lead you to believe.,"A hokey, synthetic, horror film that never really disturbed or frightened me. Despite the sensational details of the film, it's laborious, and the characterizations and details in the first half of the film are not particularly necessary. The script seems truncated and leaves many things unexplained and Lee J. Cobb's detective serves no real purpose. For me, the most disturbing scenes were those involving the rigorous and invasive medical tests that the doctors put Regan through, and the film's single most impressive effect is the make up job on Max Von Sydow, a most convincing job of aging. Ellen Burstyn, a powerful performer, is effectively shrill and over the top, and Linda Blair's performance as Regan is a triumph of make up, dubbing and special effects. Unlike Hitchcock, Polanski or DePalma, Freidken takes his horror seriously; the film is heavy-going; humorless and shallow, and you don't feel for Regan or her mother, so the movie basically operates on the level of a carnival freak show.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"High-camp tag lines, but little more","I suppose the special effects were state-of-the-art at the time.  Yay. Linda Blair's head spins around, the bed does the Mashed Potato, etc., etc., and it's all very lovely.  Too bad it doesn't make up for a jumpy storyline which really doesn't flow well.The Iraq sequence is pretty to look at, I admit; but it is in no way relevant to the rest of the story.  The only connection I found was the image of that fertility statue appearing in a particularly poor special effect.  I guess we're supposed to draw the conclusion that the evil fertility god possessed Regan.  That fifteen minutes wasted on Iraq could have been much better used to develop Regan's possession, perhaps making Captain Howdy more than a sideline?Overall, I was singularly unimpressed by this film.  I realize that, in the early 70s, many things done/said by Regan were shocking . . . but nowadays, if I want to see someone masturbate with a crucifix, I'll watch a Madonna video.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Masterpiece - more than just a horror film,"I live in the UK. When I was a teenager this film was all I could think about. Then Mary Whitehouse (a conservative activist) and a bunch of unimaginative people decided that this film was dangerous and branded it a ""video nasty"". The Exorcist and a load of other films became illegal to distribute or sell in the UK. From one day to the next, many of the horror films I loved were removed from video stores. In 1992 I remember buying a VHS player that could read NTSC tapes from the USA. I asked a friend who was travelling there to bring back a copy of the Exorcist. To date, I have never been as hysterical with excitement as when I loaded the tape into the player. I watched it over and over. The Exorcist continues to be my favourite horror movie, if not my favourite movie. Recently, I watched ""Hereditary"" and that brought back similar feelings I had when watching The Exorcist for the first time, but that initial impact I felt as a teenager will probably never be matched.Has it dated? Possibly somewhat, but it was made in 1973 and that's part of its greatness. I have gone to war with people who've put the film down.The Exorcist was made with guts and passion and it deserves the praise it continues to receive then, now and forever. It's a great story with intrepid direction, it's scary as hell with a tremendous cast and performances to match - what else is there to say except that we are all not worthy; it's a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Timeless Masterpiece,"Film Review: The Exorcist (1973)William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" isn't just a film; it's an experience that transcends the screen, etching itself into the very fabric of cinematic history. Released in 1973, this masterpiece of horror continues to haunt and mesmerize audiences with its unparalleled blend of terror, atmosphere, and profound storytelling.At its core, ""The Exorcist"" is a chilling exploration of faith and the battle between good and evil. Adapted from William Peter Blatty's novel, Friedkin's direction brings to life a tale that delves deep into the darkest recesses of the human psyche. From the ominous opening scenes in Iraq to the eerie streets of Georgetown, every frame is steeped in an atmosphere of dread and foreboding.Central to the film's success is the powerhouse performance of Linda Blair as Regan, the possessed young girl. Blair's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing, as she effortlessly transitions from innocence to malevolence, capturing the audience's hearts and then chilling them to the core. Her transformation into the vessel of a demonic force is as captivating as it is horrifying, leaving an indelible mark on the annals of cinematic history.Equally compelling is Ellen Burstyn as Regan's distraught mother, Chris MacNeil. Burstyn imbues her character with raw emotion and maternal desperation, anchoring the film's emotional core amidst the supernatural chaos unfolding around her. Jason Miller's Father Karras provides a conflicted and deeply human perspective on the battle against evil, while Max von Sydow's iconic portrayal of Father Merrin brings a sense of gravitas and spiritual authority to the proceedings.But perhaps the true star of ""The Exorcist"" is its ability to tap into universal fears and anxieties, transcending the horror genre to become a profound meditation on the nature of belief and the existence of evil. Friedkin masterfully builds tension through a combination of atmospheric cinematography, haunting sound design, and expertly crafted practical effects, culminating in a series of iconic set pieces that have lost none of their power to shock and disturb over four decades later.From the infamous head-spinning scene to the visceral intensity of the exorcism itself, ""The Exorcist"" remains a tour de force of cinematic horror, pushing the boundaries of what audiences thought possible and leaving an indelible mark on popular culture. Its influence can be felt in countless films that followed, but none have matched its raw power and lasting impact.In conclusion, ""The Exorcist"" stands as a timeless masterpiece of horror cinema, a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and the human capacity for both darkness and redemption. With its unforgettable performances, haunting imagery, and profound thematic depth, it remains as potent and relevant today as it did upon its release over five decades ago. For fans of the genre and aficionados of great cinema alike, it is simply essential viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrific Performances and Direction,"The Exorcist (1973)*** (out of 4)William Friedkin's classic about a concerned mother (Ellen Burstyn) who goes to a young priest (Jason Miller) after fearing her daughter (Linda Blair) has become possessed by a demon. There's no question about it but THE EXORCIST is certainly one of the most loved horror films ever made. To me, technically, it's one of the most flawless dramas from this era and I think this is where it's strongest material comes from. The film perfectly captures a mother's horror of witnessing something attacking her daughter and at first no one really knows what it is but her fears keep getting worse and worse with each new attack. I think this is a perfect set-up for some real-life drama and director Friedkin does a tremendous job here. Of course, when the demonic stuff begins to happen is when most viewers will turn away from being so frightened or perhaps they won't even bother watching because it scares them so badly. For me, the film has never scared me. I'm not sure what it is but perhaps it's due to my belief that good defeats evil. I'm not sure but it's always amazing to me that I can enjoy something so much yet it's main ""thing"" is something that doesn't work on me. In some ways I see the demonic stuff as somewhat more exploitation than anything else. I mean, the profanity, the self harming and other vile things that happen were obviously going to shock a mainstream crowd in 1973. These things just really don't effect me and I honestly think they're the weakest stuff in the film. Even during the exorcism some of the most striking moments aren't exactly what we're seeing happen but instead the more psychological stuff that the demons words are having on the priest. With that said, there's no question that the film contains some of the greatest performances you're going to see from a film like this. Burstyn is remarkably strong in the role of the mother and Miller is also terrific as the troubled priest. Blair perfectly fits the part of the loving child but the real key to her is once she starts to become possessed. Max von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb are such strong, fierce character actors that seeing them in a film like this just gives the movie more strength.I will say that the ""Director's Cut,"" as it's now called, is a lot weaker than the original version people saw in 1973. The infamous spider walk might have been a good idea on paper but seeing it here just makes me certain it should have remained on the editing room floor. The various Satanic images that pop up throughout the movie are more distracting than anything else. I also didn't care for the added ending or the extra scenes involving Regan's doctors. In reality, I'd say nothing added to the picture helped it.",,Anonymous,Horror
A classic horror movie...,"It is hard to grasp that ""The Exorcist"" was made back in 1973, especially since it actually still managed to hold its own now in 2017.I will say that ""The Exorcist"" is not overly scary, taking into consideration that this is a horror movie. But I am sure that it was quite scary back in the day when it was first unleashed upon the world. However, it is still a rather disturbing movie, given its storyline.Sure, the movie shows signs of being from 1973, but still it does manage to stand tall and hold its own even today. Just bear in mind that the effects are from 1973, so they are not up to par with what we see in movies today.It is the storyline in ""The Exorcist"" that makes this movie work so well. ""The Exorcist"" is about a young teenage girl who becomes possessed by the Devil and her mother arranges for an exorcism at the hands of two Catholic priests.""The Exorcist"" has some pretty good casting, which includes some nice performances by Max von Sydow, Jason Miller and Linda Blair.This is also somewhat of a classic in the horror genre, and this should be a movie that you should be more than familiar with if you are a fan of horror movies.

A classic for a reason...,"It has taken me forever to get around to this, as I must admit I'm not a huge fan of demonic possession movies when they are straight-faced, but with this being hailed by many as one of it not THE greatest horror film of all time, I had to see it for myself. I watched the theatrical version.The Exorcist follows the MacNeil family; actress Chris, her daughter Regan and their various staff and helpers. During the production of the latest film Chris is starring in, Regan begins to display bizarre behaviour. At first the doctors and physcologists that see her believe Regan to have some sort of neurological disorder, but none of their (rather grim, I must add) treatments are successful. Chris begins to suspect that Regan may be possessed, and when people who come into contact with her start dying, Chris goes to the church for help. Thing is, exorcisms haven't been done for centuries, as demonic possession is nonsense, right? Right??????It's quite hard for me to review a film of this... cultural significance after a single viewing, but I'll try. I bet this was quite the experience back in 73 when it was released, and even today there are many scenes that are still quite disturbing. The film is well shot, the sets are great and the performances are all excellent. Each character is well rounded, has a realistic back story and goes through a definitive arc. You have Chris, who is focused on her work in the beginning but becomes the parent we can all relate to when she will do ANYTHING to save her daughter, we have Regan, a mild mannerd and inquisitive child who quite literally becomes demonic (awesome performance, I must say), and of course we have Father Karrus, an alchoholic priest who is doubting his faith after the death of his mother, but has to pull himself together and do everything in his power to save this girl. Classic redemption.One thing I really liked about this was the fact that the first half of the film was grounded in the whole 'this can be explained by science' angle, which I wasn't expecting... and the procedures you see Regan go through were quite realistic and almost as horrifying as the later possession stuff. This made the film feel tangible in a way that it wouldn't otherwise. The special effects were also really good for the time, with them pulling out all the stops to make Regan look as horrible as possible. Oh, and of course - Tubular Bells. I mean, come on...Any negatives? To be honest, not really. I suppose you could say this film is over 50 years old now, and in many ways it looks it - but you can't really criticise a film for looking 50 years old when it is. If anything, it adds to the charm.Overall, I can totally see why this film is revered as much as it is, and I should imagine it was mind blowing when it was released. Like I said, I'm not a huge fan of demonic possession (hence why my score isn't a touch higher), but The Exorcist is still probably the best example of the genre I have seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The original and best,"If you were in that era of the 1970s this was the film. The film you talked about, it is a classic. The book is good the film is good that's something that doesn't alway follow. This film has been copied that many times now, people don't see it for what it truly was and still is and that is terrifying. There is an argument it's not a horror film at all, a psychological thriller about what happens to a family when something out of their control happens in the household. But I like to think of it as a horror though, the horror film of it's time. Just like the original Frankenstein must have been in the early 30s.

"One of the Great Films, and Friedkin's best work","I remember the first time I watched William Friedkin's and William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist. My father had fed me the line that it was the scariest movie ever made, and I bought into it. However, I was determined to watch it. I put it on in the middle of a bright and sunny day, determined to minimize the scares. Well, the effort wasn't really justified because I wasn't terribly scared. I was, on the other hand, completely enthralled. This was a horror film that completely pulled me in, helped me buy the entire conceit, and, even though I didn't feel fear, I did feel something across the running time. Horror movies may not scare me, but they should provide something more than just jump scares, and The Exorcist provides much, much more.AdvertisementChris MacNeil (Ellen Burnstyn) is an actress temporarily living in Georgetown while she films a movie with her director and friend Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran). Her daughter, Regan (Linda Blair), is an innocent 12-year old girl who's going to school and just being all innocent. If I have a problem with this film (and it really is an if, I don't really have a problem with this) is the perhaps over-cloyingly nice relationship between Chris and Regan in the film's first twenty-minutes or so. They're precious together in a way that doesn't quite feel real, but this is shorthand to show how much Chris loves Regan. Considering everything that comes after, this is a necessary building block to what is to come.At the same time, we are introduced to Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), a psychologist to the priests of Georgetown who is having a crisis of faith, finding increasing reason to wonder how God's plan is supposed to work when he hears other priests' crises all day. In addition, his own mother (Vasiliki Maliaros) in New York is slowly dying alone in her little apartment while he's refused a transfer to be closer to her. Where the film spends its first half or so is building up these two characters, showing Chris as a secularist who never considers religion and Karras as a religious man who cannot comprehend good in a world with so much evil. These are the cornerstones that Blatty and Friedkin had decided to build their story of faith, and it ends up working so remarkably well.Of course, the point is the possession of Regan, and I love how Friedkin portrays the build up (the whole film is really build up, to be honest). It's just little things. The indicator on the Ouija board moving a few inches seemingly on its own (or did Regan push it with a finger?). The candle suddenly flaming up. The sound of scratching in the attic that surely must be mice even if they don't set off any traps. It's presented in this extremely sedate form where these weird, unusual events occur, and then we move on. It can be explained away as just unusual, and to call attention to it would be to say that unnatural things are happening. That's not what a rational, secular woman would say, so we move on.The possession targets Regan, of course, and she essentially becomes a new person. Vulgar in more ways than one and violent, Chris takes her to doctor after doctor looking for an explanation. The cold, clinical look at medicine nearly torturing a little girl is some of the scariest stuff in the film, and it borders on Kubrickian in its clean, cinematic approach. That pursuit of scientific explanations for metaphysical happenings is the heart of the film. If there is more than our philosophy, then that opens up questions about the nature of reality that our philosophy isn't ready to explain. That touches on real terror without going fully into Lovecraftian territory: there's more out there than we can comprehend, and it wants to hurt the innocent.Of course, it's kind of a cheap ploy to take a child and make them evil in a horror film, but that is a key source of horror: the corruption of something that should be safe and innocent. In Kubrick's The Shining, it was the family unit (in particular the father). Here, it's a twelve-year-old girl.Chris's search obviously leads her in desperation to Father Karras. He's resistant because of his own faith issues but also his background as a psychologist, understanding that many of the reasons for exorcism in the past could be explained through modern understandings of mental illness. Her desperation, though, leads him to see Regan, and we're on the path towards the inevitable exorcism. This brings in Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) who was in the prologue in Iraq where he found old depictions of the devil.The exorcism is again remarkable for its restraint. There's no bombastic music. There's precious little in terms of crazy events (something John Boorman would ""fix"" with his sequel), mostly around Regan's head spinning and floating above the bed. It's just enough otherworldly without completely breaking the reality while the focus is on our characters, mostly Karras. And this is where Friedkin's background in being more of an actor's director really comes forward. This is a character piece overall, but the concentrated dose of Karras, Merrin, and Regan in a small room playing off of each other in different ways really does recall the claustrophobic natures of The Birthday Party and The Boys in the Band. The use of strange editing and flash frames also recalls something he did in the pinnacle of the titular party in The Birthday Party. Out of everything in the film, the actual exorcism feels the most like Friedkin, the rest feels like a combination of Friedkin and Blatty.And the core strength of the film is Blatty's script, based on his novel. All of the character building is there, the contrast of the earnest priest living in a dorm while his mother lives in an old hovel as Chris MacNeil lives opulently in Georgetown is obviously derived from that script. The central ideas of faith, self-sacrifice, and rebirth come from Blatty. I can see what drew Friedkin to the project, especially considering he was probably at the height of his powers to choose his projects after his Oscar win for The French Connection, but Friedkin feels more like an expert craftsman bringing Blatty's work to life more than the driving creative force. His fingerprints are obvious, but it's Blatty's whose are the most prominent.Still, this Easter film is probably the greatest achievement of Friedkin's career. It's quiet until the violence breaks out. It's character-focused, providing the grounding on which the extreme events occur. Its thematic point is clear and focused. It's something of a complete package of a film, perhaps perfect in its construction and effect. It's really great stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Truly the greatest horror flick of all time,"I'll keep this brief. It is my opinion that The Exorcist IS the greatest horror movie of all time, bar none, taking into account the year in which it was released and the social response at that time. Nowadays, the shock factor is gone. Our senses have been dulled by the constant flow of lame so-called horror films that promise so much but fail to deliver. When you consider that this little movie emerged from relative obscurity in 1973 at a time when people were a lot more fearful of religion than they are now, and when you look at the horrific imagery and blasphemous dialogue that was hurled at the unsuspecting cinema audiences, it is little wonder that some of their stomach contents made an even earlier exit than they did!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The epitome of an American girl rapidly turning into monstrosity,"Forty-nine years after its release, I watch ""The Exorcist"" in its entirety for the first time. Yes, I have seen the exorcism bedroom snippets before so I am familiar with the tone of the movie. The biggest impression left on me is the frustration, confusion, and helplessness suffered by the mother, who watches her daughter devolve from being an innocent, happy, wholesome girl into something unspeakable, despite of all of her expensive efforts spanning multiple fields of medicine, psychiatry, law enforcement, witchcraft, and the Catholic Church. The special effects, language, and violence are showcased to scare you, but the true horror lies in the mother's aching surrender. Unspoiled by social media and countless CGI, 1973 is a pure time to experience something new, and this movie delivers at the time with its groundbreaking entrance into the genre, becoming the masterpiece standard for horror movies. The production values are top notch; the buildup is indeed slow but eerie. I do knock off a couple of points for some cringe overacting from both moms.

Most of the film's positive attributes are found in the way this one unfurls a dynamic and genuinely thrilling dual-pronged storyline. This relates to the issues here involving each of the main priests called into action which is perfectly in keeping with the type of setup employed as it weaves the setup of the younger one trying to come to terms with his relationship with his ailing mother while going through the motions of his elder trying to come to terms with the return of a figure he once battled in the past. As both of these issues revolve around fallen or shaken faith, with each one reconciling their own interpretation of how a just and loving God can allow such actions to take place, the use of bridging these factors together through their shared struggle in trying to get through the ordeal together makes for an incredibly strong starting point. From here, the delving into the supernatural comes off impeccably well with the gradually build-up of her behavior and appearance signaling the potential possession. From the party appearance to the constant verbal outbursts, the negative test results and eventual realization that it's not just anything physical but rather supernatural, this provides a great baseline for the type of outbursts necessary within the genre to justify the final exorcism as that comes off absolutely masterfully. The battle that takes place inside the bedroom offering not just incredible concepts for the sequence including the levitating, physical deformations, verbal slurs against the holy figures and much more, but to bring the storyline connotations into this one sequence has a strong overall collaboration making this one of the most powerful and devastating scenes in the entire genre. On top of the physical actions depicted here, the spiritual one that comes about here as a result of what's going on also manages to bring about a lot to like. As the terms of the exorcism drag out and the realization that the tormenting and physical confrontations offers up the kind of standout throughline for the initial viewpoint of restoring faith. Given the loss he's exhibited and how these events have affected his mindset prior to the exorcism, to use this as a secret bridge to their lives as they both require the other to fulfill their personal struggles adds a fantastic psychological advantage over the physical action being undertaken. This correlation between the incredible physical action and emotional turmoil that takes place helps to set it above it's contemporaries and cash-ins and overall all manage to combine together into one of the genre's finest features. There's not a whole lot going on here that holds this one down. In fact, the one issue to be had with the film concerns the somewhat glacial first half and the amount of time it takes before getting to the actual possession. Most of the scenes here are really not that interesting as they delve instead around the utterly endless scenes of her mother spending time going between the film shoot and tending to her worsening condition which explodes so quickly into testing for something on such flimsy evidence that it's quite difficult to believe what's going on. This endless series of medical testing brings a rather sluggish pace to what's going on as this serves the background information needed to make the exorcism work; the pacing featured here is what drags it down as it stands out being the main issue on display.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Strong Violence, strong sexual scenes involving an underage person, strong religious themes and children-in-danger.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""The Exorcist"" (1973 - Hell yeah, it's that good, scary!!!","William Friedkin has a reputation in Hollywood as one of its great directors of fast-paced ""chase movies."" ""The French Connection"" (1971), the controversial ""Cruising"" (1980), and ""To Live and Die in L.A."" (1985) come to mind. ""The Exorcist,"" his 1973 masterpiece of horror, is a chase movie in that regard, albeit a rather ""contained"" one, in that the ""chases"" all occur in one place, and don't involve cars, guns, or explosions.""The Exorcist"" has a reputation as the scariest movie of all time. I'm inclined to agree. I've never seen such horrific imagery from a movie in my life. Much of the ghastly imagery and scenery in ""The Exorcist"" still remains fresh in my mind. On top of that, I've never been so thoroughly unsettled by a horror film before. Before watching this movie, I knew (knew is italicized) that ""The Exorcist"" was the scariest movie of all time; I just needed to confirm it with my own eyes, and ears.The chase elements in this movie come into play in its second half, when Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) and Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) work together to save Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) from possession by the Devil, and to ""chase"" it back to Hell. Regan is the daughter of actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), who at first thinks her daughter is suffering from some sort of strange mental disorder, but is forced to face the horror herself in that fact that her daughter is possessed by unholy forces intent on dragging her kicking & screaming into the darkest depths of the demonic underworld.Based on the controversial novel of the same name by William Peter Blatty (who also wrote the screenplay), ""The Exorcist"" is THE horror film, and essential viewing for any true fan of the genre. Some will agree, some will disagree, but I don't think that lessens the film's impact. I've never been so thoroughly shocked by a motion picture before; all the warnings I've received beforehand proved out to be true. The film relies on realistic performances, Friedkin's precision direction, innovative and ground-breaking special effects, mood, horrific imagery, and disturbing bits & pieces of dialogue for its effects on the viewer (basically anything uttered by then-14-year-old Linda Blair while under the effects of demonic possession).I don't expect many of today's younger viewers to probably understand the significance of this picture, and its lasting effect on horror movie-making. They're too accustomed to gore and special effects. I should know, I'm one of them; I'm only 24, but I know powerful film-making when I see it. ""The Exorcist"" is the scariest horror movie I've ever seen. Don't believe me? Just watch it for yourself.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The 30th Anniversary of one of the all-time greats,"More so than Alfred Hitchock's ""Psycho"",more so than Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"",William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" expanded the limits of what was acceptable terrain for a commercial horror film. This classic shocker of the supernatural,and one of the scariest films of all time,which notoriously contains a sense of a demonically possessed 12 year-old girl masturbating with a crucfix,shocked critics and even frightened its audiences when it was released more than thirty years ago. When it was released in 1973,there were reports of people fainting or succumbing to hysterics. Movie theater operators confided that they were standing by with paper bags and kitty litter for the piles of vomit in the aisles. Also,some even ran for their very lives out of the theatre and movie operators had to even call in the local law enforcement to calm down individuals who were out of control. It's ver hard to see or even imagine today's audiences having such visceral reactions to a current films such as ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"",""Jaws"", ""Halloween"",""Friday The 13th,""Alien"",""A Nightmare on Elm Street"",and ""The Omen"",to name a few. As extreme as the reactions were,audiences couldn't get enough of it making it one of the top ten films of 1973 and one of the highest grossing picture of its day beside boxoffice contenders of that year were ""The Sting"",""Enter The Dragon"",""American Graffiti"",""Serpico"",and ""The Way We Were"" all were released in 1973.It also beat out its competition for the highest grossing film as well,dethroning Francis Ford Coppula's 1972 crime epic ""The Godfather"",and Irwin Allen's 1972 disaster epic ""The Poseidon Adventure"" to reign supreme as one of the highest grossing horror films of all time,until 1975's ""Jaws"",dethroned ""The Exorcist"" off the top spot. But in this case,the outrage that cause a political and social debate over this picture mabye seems quaint today,but in the 30 years since William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" scared the bejesus out of everyone,we've inmbibed so many violent movies that it is very hard to be shocked since advance technological achievements in filmmaking his come along. While moralists and psychologists may debate the effects of this progressive desensitization,the passage of time does have one benefit,it is easier to evaluate ""The Exorcist"" on other terms rather than its shock value. Even after all those years,Linda Blair's character of Reagan will give some individuals nightmares that will haunt them for the rest of their natural lives.",,Anonymous,Horror
a milestone,"I saw 'The Exorcist' 32 years too late. This was not the kind of films to be allowed in the Communist Romania of my youth. It's really a milestone in the horror movies genre.I dare say that if 'Exorcist' was made today it won't go controversy-free. In the current moralistic climate, and with the on-going debates about the role of the Catholic church, a film about Catholic exorcism would generate some debate. The thing is that three decades passed and as we got used with this one, we can argue now about the 'Da Vinci Code'.The art of the movie is to take the very un-believable story of a pre-teen-age girl with a deteriorating mental health and make us believe that the only logical explanation is that she is possessed. We would not believe it in real life, we truly believe it on screen. The means to achieve this artistic truth are mostly classical cinema, good story telling and solid acting but at the same time the film is revolutionary by bringing to screen for the first time elements of the horror genre that have become routine since then - levitation, psycho-kinetic capabilities, and especially the make-up that transforms the angelic Linda Blair into a demonic kid-monster.Director William Friedkin had 'French Connection' in his record when he did 'The Exorcist'. This was to be his last great film, unless the future will bring us surprises - he is still working, now in his 70s. But these two movies are more than most directors do good in their whole lives, and well enough to book him a place in the history of the seventh art.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's just not scary,I'm sure it was decades ago but unfortunately the horror element hasn't aged well. I actually found some of the scenes quite funny. Probably because of Scary Movie 2 and Repossessed as some scenes are very similar and I couldn't get the image of James Woods sticking his tongue out at Megan Vorhees on the bed 😄 it's still an OK movie but I'm not sure I'd watch it again. 🤷‍♂️,6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Excellent film. A memorable and shocking impacting classic. Psychologically scary, a question and test of faith.","I remember growing up as a kid and my mother telling me about a film called ""The Exorcist"" and how that when she watched it that she had nightmares for months. My mom was even afraid to go asleep. So finally after several years later when I got into my early and mid twenties I decided to do several viewings of ""The Exorcist"" so I could feel the effects of it. And I must say it's a very powerful film maybe one of the best ever made. It's a film that's subject matter demonic possession left me psychologically frightened and really if you felt like me asking about faith, and it really proves that great forces of evil exist in the world. The first couple of viewings alone had me worried about nightmares only believing positive and having strong faith helped get me thru and with more viewings the effects aren't as bad.""The Exorcist"" based on similar real life events was adapted also from William Petter Blatty's novel. Directed by William Friedkin his portrayal of images and depiction of scenes are really shocking as he behind the camera really pushed this work beyond the limits. Set in Washington D.C. in the college town of Georgetown actress Chris MacNeil(beautifully done by Ellen Burstyn)has just arrived to act in her latest film she's divorced and she's brought along daughter Regan(Linda Blair in a very harrowing and near perfect performance)who's so sweet and innocent. Yet gradually Regan starts to feel different as things start to happen inside her body and her surroundings are shaken up. But medical experts can find nothing wrong.It becomes clear this is no medical problem this is a bad case of devil possession! Interesting is a subplot involving a young local priest Father Karras(wonderfully done by Jason Miller)who's a man who is battling his own personal demons aside from faith he feels guilt from not being in New York when his sick mother passed away. Ironically Miss MacNeil will turn to Karras(a conflicted man who has doubts about priesthood) for help as his education in psychiatry of the spiritual nature will be the best way to battle Regan's demons. Plus with the help of Father Merrin(played blunt and to stone perfection from Max Von Sydow) an expert on possession that is the best way to battle the demons of this badly haunted little girl.And many scenes in the film are frightening and grossly harrowing from the green vomit and bloody cross masturbation scene many viewers that watch especially religious will be highly disturbed. It was reported that the role of Regan had such an impact on a young Linda Blair that she required help from a psychologist during filming and I can believe that due to the films subject matter and the many mature scenes that the young girl had to deal with. A nice side dish is the supporting performance of one screen veteran Lee J. Cobb as the straight arrow and folksy Lt. Kinderman. Overall the entire cast of the film is superb.Really what more can I say ""The Exorcist"" is a powerful film it came along in a decade and time(the 1970's)when motion picture was at it's best. The scenes though disturbing were harrowing and affecting to one's mind and Linda Blair was over the top probably one of the better performances in film history for a youth. ""The Exorcist"" proved that evil really does exist in the world and demonic possession can happen, as many people will tell you after watching this film it has them thinking about their soul. As really this picture is a test of faith. I took from it everything will be okay just remember have faith in god then you don't have to fear anything. ""The Exorcist"" is a powerful work a strong film with a haunting theme a classic that's memorable, frightening, and visually shocking and haunting forever. It's clearly one of the best pictures ever made a truly defining work.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It gets better as you age.,"Everyone has watched the exorcist at some point and its so well know that franchises like Scary Movie have ripped it off so well that its difficult not to raise a smile when scenes which were lampooned show up in the first few mins of the exorcist. Or so I thought.
It doesnt take long for the creeping dread of this movie to make you forget Scary Movie ever existed.
Theres no real need to explain the plot as its so well know.
Having watched this when I was much younger what I recalled were the possession scenes and the exorcism itself, however that isnt where the magic lies.
What stands out re-watching this as an adult was the sinister and creepy build up towards the exorcism.
What seems to be forgotten is that in this movie the possession is never really confirmed until the final third of the movie, a host of psychiatrist use the crude science available at the time in order to try and explain away the behaviour of the possessed girl. Watching the mother try to come to terms with whats happening and the ordeal the girl experiences at the hands of the medics is also harrowing.
The reason this is regarded as one of the best movies ever made are the human relationships and trials as an adult which are tested by the devil. Its aim is to drive a wedge between families and exploit the guilt families may feel towards each other. It is also authentic and was aided in production by the church who ensured it treated the matter seriously.
Sure some of the effects may look dated but its still effective. Or it was when I watched it this halloween in a freezing, dusty and decaying cinema. The environment certainly added to atmosphere of the movie.
I have heard reviews that some younger audiences have found this funny and cannot take it seriously, I doubt that will be the case when they grow up and watch this with the eyes of an adult. Its much more than one of the best horrors, its one of the best movies ever made. Period.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Exorcist,"Well, I don't review films, in fact this is my first one, but I find really ridiculous some of the reviews here that say things like this is not a scary film
or that is overhyped.They are absolutely wrong. This is a film that if you are an open minded person with a minimum knowledge about history, or psychology or human
behaviour in general will make you very very unsettled. It's all about something than rational things like science or medicine can not control, nor the money ( the mother's character is a wealthy person, well connected, etc). Nope, the enemy here is the unknown, the uncontrollable sense of fear that
on top of all this, feasts freely on a fragile, innocent little girl.I remember that I was just a kid, I think I was about 12, and the book was in our home. I have no siblings so my parents had it around but not particularly
hidden considering the contents. Well, off I went to bed with the book, it was September, a windy night and I started to read...
I was terrified when I started to realise what was happening, however I was so fascinated than I couldn't stop.This was during a weekend so I went on and finished it in about 12 hours meals and all in the middle of course. But the book did hit
the bull's eye. Hard. I couldn't sleep well for 2 weeks and the story kept coming back at me again and again.A couple of years after I had the chance to watch the film and, oh boy, it's probably one of the most accurate adaptations of a book ever produced,
so much so, that even years after it had exactly the same effect. It scared the hell out of me.Of course I did watch the film several times after, alone or with another family members or friends and believe me, The Exorcist is one of those films
that stay with you over the years. Obviously as a film lover and as time went by, I did understand the technical aspects of the making, the acting (which in this film is brilliant), other things like the score with the famous Mike Oldfield tune and everything.So, if you like a good story and you are not afraid of the unknown and the evil, treat and indulge yourself and don't listen to the bad or ignorant reviews.Do yourself a favor and watch itYou'll be amazed.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Moody, memorable creep-out with strong writing and performances.","This ground breaking, starkly filmed thriller stands for many as one of the most terrifying films of all time.  (Conversely, a faction of agnostic viewers are left with a less jolting experience, sometimes even finding the film funny!)  Quite explicit for its time, it raised the bar in film-making for gore and realism and adult horror and has been emulated many times. However, it is set apart by its well-written (Oscar-winning, in fact) script and realistic performances.  Burstyn is an actress who begins to sense unusual behavior in her preteen daughter (Blair.)  The bizarre symptoms (open sores, violent thrashing, etc...) escalate as Burstyn seeks help from all conventional avenues.  Finally, she determines that Blair is possessed by Satan and must be exorcised.  Miller is a troubled priest whose own problems pale in comparison with the dilemma facing Burstyn.  When things get worse instead of better, it is up to legendary priest Von Sydow to attempt to rid the child of the demons inside her.  The sense of fear and dread is aided by the cold, claustrophobic settings and the use of the music 'Tubular Bells' during key moments.  The visuals are primitive by today's standards, but still provide jolts, notably Blair's explosive green vomit. Her celebrated 360 degree head turning has lost it's punch now.  The film is packed with gross-out moments and shockingly blasphemous episodes which work to upset and disarm the viewer.  Mercedes McCambridge helped provide the raspy, vulgar voice of the possessed Blair.  A disastrous and heavily panned sequel ""The Exorcist II:  The Heretic"" starred an older Blair and Richard Burton.",,Anonymous,Horror

YOUR MOTHER COOKS SOCKS IN HELL,"I didn't see The Exorcist until its re-release in the late nineties, having heard it was one of the greatest films ever madeI thought it was pretty good but never felt the need to watch it again until it popped up on the BBC's iPlayer this Hallowe'enOn second viewing, it turns out this is one of the greatest movies ever madeThe most striking thing about the movie is how little exorcism it contains. That whole sequence is 20 minutes of the movie; the first and second acts have three scenes where Regan's possessedThe bulk of the movie is a concerned mum trying to figure out what's wrong with her daughter and trying to find someone who can help. It plays like one of those movies of the week where a kid has a rare disease and doctors don't believe the parentsIn fact, I wish the film had played it a little more straight and left room for the possibility Regan was suffering some kind of psychiatric distress. You'd only need to lay off the make-up and one mechanical effect to let the audience walk away with their own interpretation of eventsThe scenes of Regan being subjected to a barrage of medical examinations really do play like the medieval torture those accused of demonic possession endured in previous centuriesAnd Friedkin gets as much (more) dramatic effect out of Burstyn hearing noises from the attic as he does from revolving heads and projectile vomitingAnd the empathic response to Karris' relationship with his unfortunate mother provides more unsettling moments for the viewer than anything the special effects department cook upThe simple device of an old homeless guys voice - CAN YOU HELP AN ALTAR BOY, FATHER? - coming out of Regan's mouth is unsettling in a way I can't explainIt's all the exact opposite of the maximal approach to film making today, when anything can be shown on screen at minimal expense. What the infinite possibilities afforded by CGI amount to is a net loss, when they mean effects such as this are neglectedAnd the aesthetics of seventies film making mean the entire production looks ravishingEverything from the film stock, to wardrobe, set decoration and even the gorgeous cars of the period lend the film an air of sophistication, while the autumnal setting and the architecture of Georgetown create an atmosphere that recalls Rosemary's Baby and Hallowe'enSometimes, the greats really are The Greats.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Powerful, Shocking and Incredible","'The Exorcist' is often considered the greatest and scariest horror movie of all-time that has not only stood the test of time, but its impact singlehandedly changed horror cinema forever, which is quite an achievement for a 50-year-old movie. Frightening, atmospheric, disturbing and yet utterly compelling, this is something that well and truly deserves its legendary status.The Plot = An actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) notices the dramatic and dangerous changes in her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) behaviour and physical appearance leading her to believe that her daughter has been inhabited by a malevolent entity, leading the mother to seek out help from two Catholic priests Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) & Father Karras (Jason Miller) to save her life.Based upon the best-selling novel by William Peter Blatty and skilfully directed by William Friedkin who does an astounding job of adapting the book onto the big screen by slowly building the narrative with unnerving tension and effective sequences that lays the groundwork for a satisfying intense climax with shocking imagery, gruesome special effects and morally depraved acts that still packs a punch to this day. Everything about this iconic masterpiece works, from the direction, the incredible acting performances, fantastic make-up effects and the stunning cinematography with many horrifying and disturbing imagery that will forever be engraved into your mind forever. Whether this is in-fact ""The Best Horror Movie Ever Made"" is simply based on opinion, as the scary element of the movie works on a far less obvious level than many others of the genre and that's maybe why its stuck with so many (including myself) over the years.The acting performances in this are incredible with every character perfectly cast. Ellen Burstyn delivers an excellent and moving performance as the mother, natural and sympathetic she deserves all the praise for this role. Jason Miller gives a naturalistic and engaging performance as the priest struggling with his faith. Max Von Sydow provides an almighty presence to this film and like the others delivers a strong performance as Father Merrin.

"Quite simply my favorite horror film, this masterpiece by William Friedkin still has no equal 50 years later and its anxiety inducing atmosphere is striking.","Don't expect to jump every two minutes, Friedkin installs his film little by little, its setting up is long but fascinating, he takes the time to install his characters and his plot in this atmosphere which is stretched as it goes and concealing clues to what is happening before our eyes.We get attached to the characters and without being really afraid, our senses are put to the test thanks in particular to an efficient production, a brilliant musical theme and an almost documentary staging which gives the feature film a very realistic aspect. We feel that the whole has aged, a question of time, but when we succeed in projecting ourselves, we can easily imagine tthe reaction of the spectators of the time in question...

A tense supernatural thriller courtesy of Friedkin's tight direction and strong performances from all involved.,"Set in Georgetown, Washington D. C., actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is finishing shooting her new movie as she lives with her young daughter Regan (Linda Blair) in the area. While Chris and Regan enjoy a good relationship, events start to transpire that see strange noises in their home and a personality change in Regan coupled with spasms and fits that several doctors are unable to explain. With options dwindling, Chris eventually turns to help from Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), a psychiatrist and priest of the Catholic Church whose is struggling with his own faith and is reluctant to approve an exorcism.The Exorcist is a 1973 horror film directed by William Friedkin and written by William Peter Blatty adapted from Blatty's book of the same name. When Warner Bros. Acquired the book rights Blatty set to work adapting his novel and lobbied for William Friedkin to direct as he was a fan of The French Connection and thought Friedkin's gritty realism would compliment the story. The movie was notoriously troubled with several things going wrong during production that resulting in the budget escalating as well as certain members of the cast and crew suffering harm either during or after the production. Despite the tumultuous journey to the screen The Exorcist became a massive phenomenon becoming the top grossing film of 1973 outgrossing best picture winner The Sting and even got nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and won Blatty an award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Many elements of the film have become ingrained in popular consciousness from specific iconography to even lines from the film making The Exorcist a strong and stylish showcase.To give you an idea where I'm coming from, I am not a religious man nor do I believe in demonic possession or anthropomorphized embodiments of evil incarnate. When it comes to these kinds of stories involving demons, the devil, or anything adjacent to them I tend to view them in the same way others would view the Greek or Norse Pantheon: supernatural novelties whose bizarre and exotic aspects serve as fodder for the story. With that being said however, The Exorcist is a very small scale and human story in which we slowly accompany Chris bearing witness to the slow, nameless, and intangible rot taking hold within her daughter Regan. Ellen Burstyn is really good as Chris as she is introduced as a likable character along with the equally good Linda Blair as Regan and the way they take time to establish them as being a normal family makes the tragedy that befalls all the more heart wrenching. The effects and make-up work used to create the illusion of the possession are well done and Friedkin through his intense direction (that often involved scaring the daylights out of his actors) creates an oppressive and dread filled atmosphere. Jason Miller is really strong as Father Damien and the scenes where he struggles with guilt over his mother make for some strong character work that you can't help but become absorbed in.The Exorcist remains a strong example of first class horror filmmaking even if its legacy has been somewhat overcrowded by the plethora of imitators and clones several decades after the fact. Filled with strong performances and a strong sense of dread The Exorcist remains a strong showcase of the horror genre on a technical and acting level.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The first blockbuster horror film of the 70's.,"Released in 1973, to both box office and critical acclaim, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, based on the novel by William Peter Blatty, remains the quintessential horror film of good versus evil. From the opening scenes of an excavation in Northern Iraq, we are introduced to Father Merrin, and his showdown with a demon-god, which will foreshadow events in the latter part of the film. Jump to the scenery of Georgetown,U. S. A., where we are introduced to Chris MacNeil, an actress, caring for her daughter Regan. Over a period of time, Ms. MacNeil is convinced her daughter is possessed by some unknown entity, and enlists the help of science to help her. When the scientists fail to help her child, Ms. MacNeil is forced to seek the aid of Father Damien Karras, a local priest, who upon hearing of her daughter's plight, explains to her that before an exorcism can be performed on an individual, it must first be approved by the Vatican. Upon arrival at the MacNeil residence, and the greeting with the demon-child, Father Karras is convinced that Regan is possessed. The Vatican approves the rite, and both Father Karras, along with the aforementioned Father Merrin, are both assigned with the task of exorcist.What sets this film apart from all horror films before or since, are the performances . Ellen Burstyn (who should have won an Academy Award), Linda Blair (aided by the voice acting of veteran actress Mercedes McCambridge), Jason Miller, Lee J. Cobb and Max Von Sydow are all great in their roles. The special effects make-up, courtesy of Dick Smith, is both groundbreaking and shocking.The most memorable music in the the film is the opening sequence of Mike Oldfield's overdub opus Tubular Bells, which was not specifically produced for the film, but supplies a creepy, ominous air.Definitely in my top ten horror films of all timeThe film spawned several inferior Italian knock-offs including Beyond The Door, Antichrist, Return Of The Exorcist, as well as the shot-by-shot Turkish remake, Seytan. There was even a blaxploitation take on The Exorcist called Abby, starring William Marshall of Blacula fame.As far as the 1977 John Boorman sequel The Heretic...don't bother. It's tediously lame, laughable at times, and does not even come close to the original.And lastly, Exorcist:Believer. A film that borrows the name, but completely does not deliver anything to live up to it's predecessor.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A classic that deserves its 50-year public acclaim,"I avoided for a long time to watch this classical horror movie, imagining it would be too heavily depressing. However, when I had the chance to watch it on the big screen, I risked. No regret, for sure! It is a great film, extremely well developed, with a careful and layered script besides the timeless visual effects, beautiful cinematography, and skilled performances. The whole situation made me feel more sorry for all those characters than properly frigthened by the satanic manifestations. All that suffering is very strong. I was also very impressed by how sophisticated was the way the movie addressed the conflicts and mediations between faith and science. The phisicians assembled portrayed the paramount arrogance and corporatist self-preservation one may imagine. I also appreciated how the story was finished. It is indeed a classical film that deserves its half-century public acclaim.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Think twice.... B film at best...,The Exorcist may have been top notch during the early 70s but today it's just another junk B movie. H however what makes it awful and horrible is the Ellen Burstyn.

An arresting classic in terms of atmosphere.,"Forget the special effects - this film is a great movie due to its atmosphere ( just picture Reagan's room at the time of the final exorcism ) . Dark and moody in terms of photography, it accompanies perfectly its plot ( most of the time ). Also, the music is used smartly. The most haunting scene of this masterclass in suspence ( Friedkin had preveously done The French Connection ) is the scene where the possessed Reagan pees on the floor during her mother's party - the most scary is the descent of Reagan, in which she walks like a crab. Overall, this movie shows how to create viscerally an atmospere and a mood that are in tune with the psychology of Reagan, her mother and the priests.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Was never that good, and has aged very poorly","I am in my 40s and love old movies, and am very dismayed when I see the reaction of younger people to great old movies. I went to see the Exorcist wondering why I couldn't remember the details very well, like I can other movies of that era. Its because it just is not that good a movie. The problem, as usual is the script, its not well written, much of the dialogue is about very little. The pacing of the film is unendurably slow. That can work, but you need much tighter direction and a better script.  There is very little tension, and the direction is flaccid. The opening Iraq scene is totally lifeless.Susan Sarandon has said that any scene does not advance the plot or comment on the characters or themes should be cut. This movie breaks that rule big time - it is full of dead space- people walking,nothing happening, uninteresting dialogue.There was a long list of music credits at the end, but it seemed to me most of the soundtract was almost inaudible, at least where I saw it.I think most of the reputation of this movie comes from Linda Blair's antics, which I guess were once shocking but now are nothing more than comedy. Similar movies of this era, like ""The Omen"" and especially Rosemary's Baby, are much better written and still pack some punch.I wish I liked this movie more, I really do.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Exorcist,"The Exorcist is a one of those quintessential movies you just gotta have seen. Especially as a horror fan, and I finally got to it. To say it aged great is an overstatement, but what didn't age bad was the fantastic acting, the disturbing elements, and great, grounded and straight directing that makes it all so much more real. Did I really fall in love for it though, not really, the fact it's still this good being this old shows for something though. And in 1973 this would've been so much more intense, even just as a kid. This was THE scary movie no good-loving parent wanted their kids to see.Directing and pacing. For a movie from 1973, it definitely looks and feels the part. And it's pacing is the biggest indicator, because this movie really puts you back into your seat with slow methodical pacing. For modern audiences, like myself, the first half was pretty tough to keep engaged in. The acting helped and the interesting premise. But still. The directing is fantastic, besides some lovely stylized shots, there are so many gems, going from that grounded and quite static directing makes a lot more special scenes standout. The priest's dream is one that really feels special. If anything that feels much more memorable to me than the typical scenes, probably because I knew them already as they are unavoidable to have seen in passing.Acting hold up well, everyone is great here. Special shoutout to Blair though, that kid sold it. And that's beside the make-up. The mother excelled as well, really getting that dread across and as a character very likable as well as she truly tries every angle before going for the seemingly absurd.VFX/Gore. Fantastic, I don't know what it is about that green goop but it was actually still effective for me, though being comically green, it still managed to feel nasty. I think just that goop interacting with the girls gnarly face and scar just...ew. Make-up on the girl is fantastic, still to this day imo, the eyes are intense. The scene were she's loose and sitting offside the bed, great.Music and sound. Music, pretty iconic but slightly weird score. It's super insignificant in the movie itself as the memorable score plays in a scene were nothing happens. Sound though... it's sadly such a mixed bag. If anything sound aged really poorly. There are a few that are fine, but most of them feel so out of place, they take me out of the movie. The sounds just aren't in that room, they're flat, blurry and messy. I did love the constant weird breathing and noises from the demon, that constant off putting sound added a lot, like a constant dread. But the sound being so rough most of the time is my major turnoff.Story is pretty simple, vague as well. As we just get hints, how and what, who knows. It's clear enough in the end though. Though it felt slightly underwhelming to me.In the end, it's must watch for horror fans. But time is running out for how ''watchable'' this movie will stay.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Maybe I'm just jaded, or maybe it's because I'm an atheist, but this a terribly pathetic movie.  The only amusing thing about it is how hard it tries to be scary, but it just ends up making a fool of itself.

A classic horror film which started it all,"I know that this film has been reviewed to death and is pretty much known or has been seen by every horror fan in existence. So is there anything more to be said. Jus an obligation from another horror fan. Saw this in the mid 80s with my parents on a VHS. Bought the dvds of the trilogy n the 2 alternate prequels, The beginning n The dominion. Revisited this recently. Director William Friedkin did a masterful job of transforming William Peter Blattys book into a motion picture. He managed to create a real masterpiece. The direction is impeccable n the pacing effective n the tension is unbearable and there are some really frightening moments. The shot which forms the cover of the movie is a classic, the tall figure of Merrin (Max Von Sydow) as he stands in front of the house, about to confront the evil within is hauntingly memorable.The cast is excellent: Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Jason Miller, Linda blair as the possessed girl n Lee J.

ONE OF THE SCARIEST & BEST HORROR FILMS OF ALL TIME,"THE EXORCIST (1973) **** Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb, Kitty Winn.  Director William Friedkin's masterpiece of terror encapsulating William Peter Blatty's bestselling blockbuster about a little girl possessed by Satan sent audiences into a dark, unsettling and very scary journey into fear, faith and the possibility of what is real and what isn't.  Blair, in her (sadly) best and debut performance, as Regan, manages to actually act under the tremendous make-up job by maestro Dick Smith and gave new meaning to `pea soup' and evoke true spine-chills thanks to the electronically altered vocals by Merecedes MacCambridge's smoky tones as the outlet of hatred for Old Scratch.  Disturbing and still stands as a spiritually powerful film that really gets under the skin with all its visceral splendor.  Kudos to the outtakes including the `spider walk' of Regan down a flight of stairs.  Creepy to the max underscored by the ethereally haunting `Tubular Bells'.  Winner of two Oscars, Best Sound and Adapted Screenplay by Blatty (look quick for him during the first campus filming sequence conferring with the director, Burke Dennings).

Could have been much better,"What is actually good in the Exorcist is success in combining strong mystic basis with a good-quality drama.Story lines of both mother and Father Karras portrayed believably and touchingly thanks to Blatty, Friedkin and for sure actors.What else is good? Some visuals - e.g. that bluish lighting in Regan's bedroom, camera movements around the wrapped bed, Regan/Pazuzu stare and animal roaring, the scene with the crucifix. Most of Pazuzu lines are adequately cynical and explicit.The most disappointing about this movie is inaccuracy with details. E.g. the tape recorded message of Regan could be a much stronger scene of daughter missing her father and could explain much better why Pazuzu decided to possess the girl. Some lines of Pazuzu are counterproductive (like ""it would be a cheap exercise of power""). Most of the special effects are unnecessary and excessive compared to the care authors paid to the drama component.The Exorcist deserves right to be treated as a classic as it set the standard in its genre. Nevertheless, for inaccurate script and excessive use of the effects it deserves only 7/10.Another classic in the genre, the 6th Sense is much better in the above terms.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
this is a movie to see true and true,"I started watching this movie hoping to be scared off my wits, as it is casted in the light of one of the scariest movies out there, well I have lost my wits and this movie freaked the hell out of me.The Exorcist is a 1973 horror film and it is directed by William Friedkin (Rules of Engagement in 2000). The movie itself was adapted by William Peter Blatty (who won an Academy Award for his work) from a novel he wrote two years prior to the movie release, the novel also named The Exorcist was inspired by the 1949 exorcism case of Roland Doe.The movie plot is about an actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) who was visiting Washington, D.C. to shoot a movie, her 12-year-old daughter Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) started behaving strangely which made Chris send her to the hospital, later on her physical appearance started to change making Chris frightened and scared.Also there in Washington is a young priest who served in a University who was starting to lose faith while dealing with his mother's terminal sickness.With Chris at her wits end knowing not what to do, took advice given to her by some doctors and called a priest to perform an exorcism on her daughter.There is a scene in the movie where Chris steps into her house and the lights flicker and you see subliminal reflections, I actually tried to put on the light while viewing the scene by using the switch in my room before I remembered that was not going to help.It was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and winning two, Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay. The Exorcist is the first horror film to be nominated for Best Picture in the 46th Academy Awards and it lost it to The Sting. It became one of the highest earning movies of all time, grossing over $441 million worldwide.It was named the scariest film of all time by Entertainment Weekly and Movies.com, IGN's Top 25 Horror Movies of All-Time has it as the number one horror movie of all time and was No. 3 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.The exorcist is a movie guarantee to scare and freak you out at the same time take the time out to check it out.(Note: This movie has disturbing scenes and blasphemy against God and Christ) www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Best horror movie ever made,"This is by far still the best horror movie I've ever seen or made and still remains the best to the date March 8, 2020 and will always be, but people have become unbelieving and desensitized to believing in demonic possession and evil they think it doesn't exist but, since I know it is real and have seen it, in real life, that's what makes this movie so true to me.
As a child my mother wouldn't let me watch this movie, I was a preteen but, when I became an adult I felt like I knew why she didn't want me to see it. I was scared of horror movies but, still wanted to watch them. I know, that today a lot of people don't know what real horror movies are, they think its blood and gore cutting up bodies seeing people get killed, by knives or some object that's not real horror !!!!!! That's just murder I call justified by some unbelievable monster hollywood made to get your bucks. Real horror is the unknown that creepy, eerie, feeling you can't explain, eventhough you see it, you know it's from the devil and evil, that's real horror!!!!! This movie delivers that feel !!!!!
Also, speaking of the setting and the overall feel of this movie. It is unsettling, demonic, scary, believable, Satanic, witch crafty, partly biblical. The acting is excellent, great cast, but, one thing I never liked about this movie it doesn't tell the truth about demon possession it makes the Audience believe imo, that Catholic's are the only one's that can cast out a demon, according to the bible I read, I know for a fact this is untrue but other than that, this is the most terrifying horror movie of all times and still is no one has topped it imo, as of yet, trust me, I've seen a large amount of horror movies and this one always gets 10 stars and more from me !!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not for the faint hearted,"This is still a scary film today. Some of the effects look a bit dated, but the style of the photography gives it a documentary feel.

Regan is a normal child until being possessed and undergoes all manner of treatment from the normal medical community. Eventually it is decided that the Catholic church needs to be brought in to complete the exorcism. Definitely not a film to watch on your own in the dark.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
my opinion,"This film goes beyond the horror genre and beyond the thriller or the esoteric and mystery genre. It's simply a great cinema. In 1973 you threw a stone into a still pond. He has led a path like no other ever. Considering it just a horror in my opinion is very limiting. It must be considered that in those years very few people had an idea of what an Exorcist was. Many didn't even have any connection to demonic possessions or deeds. I'm sorry when people only remember the protagonist's vomiting or swearing or monstrous makeup. As I said this is great cinema. A fundamental component in this film that makes it great is silence. Silence plays a fundamental role because it creates the sense of real time passing and the suspension of the events that will have to happen. Today it is very little used, unfortunately.Damian Rossi.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Should have seen it in 73,"Well, I wasn't even born back then so I had to rent it on video. Well, what do you say about the (arguably) most horrific movie EVER MADE. After seeing it I can say that it's definitely more disgusting than it is scary, containing some of the most disturbing images I have ever seen (and believe me, it's really really hard to show ME something that'll throw me off line!!!!!)I'm talking about the scene where the mother looks at the stairs and sees her demon-possessed daughter speeding(crawling) down them on her hands and feet. Or the one where she's ""offering"" herself to her mother, jumping up and down the bed. But apart from that the movie's merely disgusting(the barfing, masturbating). It is definitely one of the most influential horror movies ever made(now there's something new) ,has a good story(something most modern horror movies seriously lack!!!) and imagining I would watch it in a theater in 73 I'd probably be scared as hell. Even today, a couple of hours after watching it I can honestly say that some things will never be the same. It's probably the hype surrounding the movie that made it what it is today, but nontheless it's a movie every movie lover should see. Although, sadly it has been shamelessly copied in numerous movies, like ""Stigmata"", where Gabryel Byrne's character is a twin copy of Max von Sydow's father Merrin. But the question that really bugs me is what kind of parents would let their child have anything to do with this kind of movie. And I came to the conclusion that Linda Blair was probably an orphan. I mean she had to be, or she had some irresponsible parents. I can't imagine what an experience like that does to a kid. DAMN!!!! A movie that after almost 30 years still does the trick. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

When people ask me whats the best horror movies to watch i tell them to watch The Thing, Silence of the Lambs, The Shining, House of 1000 Corpses, Devils rejects, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but in my opinion The Exorcist was the best at least as good as the Thing which is one of my top three favorites too.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disturbing yet fascinating,"As a kid, I've always been disturbed by the concept of demon possession. The idea that a powerful entity could take over your body to cause harm to those around you and you couldn't do anything to stop it always sounded terrifying to me. While I've become more skeptical to supernatural phenomenon as I got older and thus don't retain those fears, I can't deny that William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" captures this type of horror in a way that feels almost nostalgic to me despite me not watching it until recently. Everything from the solid practical effects that still hold up well nearly half a century later to Linda Blair's believable and disturbed acting makes this a more intense and thrilling horror than most of what I've seen in the medium. While I can't say it recaptured this fear in a way that kept me up at night after watching the movie, I found it to be a fascinating look into letting your mind wander and questioning: what if I just lost all control to something beyond my understanding? Maybe this is a lot of extraneous analysis for a movie that has a basic plot outline of ""girl gets possessed, priest exorcises scary demon from her,"" but I loved the portrayal of the entity in this movie as something that we humans don't understand all that much. Even if the demon's origins get explained later in the film, its overall nature leaves enough questions that it never really loses that sense of the unknown that made the horror so effective in the first place. This lasting impression is really was separates alright horror from great horror and puts ""The Exorcist"" up with the all-time greats like ""The Shining"" and ""The Thing.""",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A classic film but lets take a look at the sub-text,"The Exorcist is a frightening film about the demonic posession of a little girl right?  Well, yes.  But if you analyze the film very carefully you will find an interesting sub-text to the movie.  You know how some people think that certain films have hidden stories?  The Exorcist is one of those.  Its hidden story is about a girl changing into a woman.  It is the story of a little girl going through puberty and the adults in her life struggling to deal with her journey to womanhood.  What's this?? This guy must be crazy you say?  It's true.  Watch the film again to see what I mean.  Keep this thought in mind and you might see a completely different movie.  That said this film is probably the scariest movie I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Still a good horror movie, but no longer sensational","After all those years ""The exorcist"" is still an effective horror movie, but it no longer is the sensation (visitors passing out while watching) that it was in the 70s. The image of father Merrin (Max von Sydow) arriving to perform the exorcism, the house surrounded by a thick fog, is however still iconic.In ""The exorcist"" the evil shows itself in the form of a child. Because a child is usually associated with innocence this is a ""trick"" that was used in horror movies before (""The village of the damned"", 1960, Wolf Rilla) and after (""The omen"", 1976, Richard Donner) ""The exorcist"". ""The omen"" creates in my opinion the same amount of suspense without using the same amount of shocking images.The possession of Regan (Linda Blair) goes to three phases.1) The use of strong (mostly sexual related) language that does not fit to her age at all.
2) Her face taking on a horribly twisted appearance.
3) Exhibiting signs that are commonly related to the antichrist such as talking in reverse language, talking in languages she did not command and knowing things she can not know.My assumption is that the fainting visitors in the 70's were related to phase 2. For me this is the least convincing and disturbing phase.""The exorcist"" is also a film about religion versus science. Mother Chris (Ellen Burstyn) consults respectively docters, a priest /psychiatrist and a priest about the strange behaviour of her daughter. The docters use scientific methods, but with no result. Father Karrras (Jason Miller), the priest psychiatrist ful of doubt, thinks exorcism is something of the (distant) past and is now replaced by diagnosis such as paranoia and schizophrenia. Only father Merrin takes the exorcism serious from the beginning.It is nothing new to see ""Bergman-actor"" von Sydow in a religious role. It is something new however that he is so sure about his religion. The doubt that von Sydow had in a film such as ""Winterlight"" (1963, Ingmar Bergman) is now embodied in father Karras.The end of the film seems to imply that there was en external source of evil in Regan after all. This is contrary to the actual case from 1949 on which the book of William Peter Blatty (from which ""The exorcist"" is an adaptation) was based.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Excellent film, yet highly overrated.","I have just recently watched this movie and was disappointed, most likely because i was expecting it to be as scary as its reputation makes it seem... but its not.

This movie is not violent/gory either, it is simply filled with ""disturbing images"" as the MPAA puts it. This movie is not worth vomiting over as you may have read. I did read that it was extremely revolting and caused people to vomit in the theaters... this is probably why i was disappointed. BUT, still this movie was excellent.

Linda Blair was excellent in acting the parts she actually acted in... The only thing this film was missing was the terror.RATING: *******///I give this movie a 7 out of 10. Whether you're a minor or major fan of the horror genre, you should see this classic. Just don't expect it to live up to the hype.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
DVD Commentary - don't bother,"I am commenting specifically about the new ""Version you've never seen"", which was rereleased in theatres recently and has come out on DVD with a Director's Audio Commentary.   There is little else in the way of extras on the DVD.  The Theatrical Trailers are just the new ones created for the re-release.  The film was directed by William Friedkin,  who did a masterful job making ""The French Connection"".  For the commentary,  he talks non-stop, but really says nothing at all  about the making of the film,  or the reaction to it's controversial subject matter.  Instead,  he talks the movie.  In other words,  he's like an annoying roommate who saw this really cool film and wants you to see it.  But instead of letting you just watch it in silence,  he tells you exactly what's going on in every scene,  like you can't figure it out for yourself.For example,  he goes on about how troubled Father Damien is about his dying Mother.  Well, gosh,  his character says out loud how he wishes he could have done more for his dying Mother.  How about some insight into how some of the special effects were done?  How did the actors cope with performing some of the scenes?  Why did you originally cut the scenes from the original release?  Go to the trivia section for this film and there are a few pages worth of interesting anecdotes,  virtually none of which is mentioned by the director.  Friedkin doesn't reveal really anything useful, except: - The scene where the detective and the mother have a 'cat and mouse' conversation is his favourite scene. - Father Damien is frequently shown rising from the ground (up a stairway, walking up a hill)As for the film itself, there are plenty of recommendations out there that establishes this film as one of the great scare flicks,  up there with ""Psycho"".  Unfortunately,  the audience for scary movies is different now then it was in the 70's.  The movie originally came out before the surge in the 80's of teener slasher movies (""Friday the 13th, Halloween,  etc.),  and really is for a more older sophisticated crowd.  It isn't surprising to hear that younger audiences watching it these days may find it slow, boring, and perhaps even silly.   One thing that escapes them is that this film,  as opposed to most mindless horror flicks,  is actually based on fact!Movie:  7 out of 10 DVD extras:  3 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Essential Horror,"I have a dirty little confession to make—I never actually saw The Exorcist in its entirety until one week ago. Taking this long to see what many consider to be the horror movie to end all horror movies is a travesty; trust me, I know. Over the years I had caught bits and pieces of it on television, but for some reason I just never took the time out of my oh-so-busy schedule to sit down and watch the whole thing from start to finish.After making a hasty decision to watch it very late one night via my Netflix Instant Queue, I found that all of the hearsay surrounding this 1973 classic is true. It's extraordinarily creepy, unsettling, and well done.Max von Sydow plays Father Merrin, a Catholic priest who moonlights as an archaeologist. It turns out that he's also one of the foremost experts on possessions and exorcisms.When Reagan, the daughter of a wealthy actress who resides in Washington D.C., is possessed by an evil spirit that claims to be none other than Satan himself, a long and winding road develops that will eventually lead a weathered old priest and a demon-possessed child to a meeting that is nothing short of bone- chilling. I'm getting a little ahead of myself, though, so let's back things up.Reagan, a 12 year-old who lives with her mother in a Georgetown area townhouse, gradually begins to exhibit increasingly erratic (and wholly bizarre) behavior. Her mother, Chris MacNeil (played by Ellen Burstyn), consults a large variety of medical professionals to try and determine what's causing the strange outbursts—which, by the way, entail sporadically cursing God and inflicting brutal physical damage on herself and others.Part of what makes The Exorcist work so well is the realistic handling of this situation by Chris (she immediately contacts a wide variety of medical professionals). Very few people would immediately think, ""Okay— my daughter is possessed"" and consult religious authorities as a primary reaction. The doctors who try to treat Reagan all approach this from a very scientific, logos-oriented standpoint too; their initial diagnosis is that she has a legion on her brain that's causing the erratic and violent behavior. After undergoing a series of gruesome tests to try and identify the location of said elusive legion, the doctors find that, physiologically, she's in full working order. Frustrated and baffled at the lack of competence these physicians have displayed, Chris starts to enter panic mode. Reluctantly, one doctor eventually suggests that Reagan is the victim of supernatural influences, and, as a last resort, Chris gets in touch with a local priest by the name of Father Karras. Karras is a well-educated man who is immediately skeptical of the supposed possession of Reagan, but he agrees to visit her and assess the situation himself. After a series of harrowing encounters with demon- Reagan, Karras, with the blessing of the Catholic church, teams up with Merrin in an attempt to drive away the evil spirit.The plot, as you've no doubt noticed, is pretty bare bones, but, like any truly scary tale regarding the paranormal, it works because it's handled with thoughtfulness and sincerity. All of the actors display a true sense of urgency in regards to the seriousness of Reagan's situation, and the acting of Blair (who, of course, was only a child at the time) is phenomenal. As Father Karras repeatedly visits and tries to learn more about who (or what) has taken over Reagan, said evil influence begins to bore into Karras' mind. Slowly, it's revealed that Karras is plagued with guilt in regards to his recently deceased mother. She passed away after he made the decision to place her in a nursing home, and Satan (or whoever is in Reagan) methodically mines that guilt until Karras is on the verge of completely losing it. The psychological horror utilized in The Exorcist is supremely scary, and this, along with many other things, helps elevate it above any other ""possession"" movie that's ever been made.Added to the effect of this is the fact that The Exorcist builds tension better than almost any other horror movie. As people approach the door to Reagan's bedroom, the sense of foreboding terror that lurks just beyond what you can see is palpable—you'll literally find the hair standing up on the back of your neck as you're pleading for whichever character to just hurry up and throw the door open so you'll be able to breathe again.And, of course, The Exorcist has many scenes that exist for no other reason than to totally freak you out. The head-turn sequence comes to mind first, and is closely followed by the stomach-turning pea soup vomit scene and the crab-walk-down-the-stairs bit that's found in the director's cut.I feel immensely guilty myself for not having scene this until the ripe old age of 27. If you consider yourself a horror aficionado and have never seen it, then go out and rent it right now—just be prepared to keep a crucifix and a vial of holy water next to your bed after you've developed a legitimate fear of the thumping sound coming from your attic.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Probably the greatest horror film of all time,"The only reason I didn't give this film a 10 was because of a few inconsistencies in editing. Otherwise, amazing acting, cinematography, camera work, effects.... What the actors and crew went through to make this film was nothing short of perfection. Surprising that Blatty, a comedy writer, was able to come up with this book which was completely outside of his comfort zone at the time. William Friedkin did an amazing job as director. This whole thing just worked - even today watching this film I'm in awe of it's greatness.

Did I mention the sound editing?!?TRUE HORROR comes from slow-burn, pure evil stuff like this classic. Not from dumb jump scares.

**1/2 out of ****,"Am I the only one who sees that this film is empty? I'm 18, sure, but I know a good movie with a story when I see one, and this isn't one. Maybe it's because of the added scenes, but there are so many plotholes that I lost interest.Of course, I wasn't one of the people laughing at everything like other teenagers (I saw many adults laughing more than the kids). The film lacks intelligible pacing and and continuity - at one point, Reagan is stabbing herself in her privates with a cross, later, she seems okay and cleaned up. She's in no pain?And what exactly is possessing her? Is it the Devil or is it some crazy Latin priest? The movie makes absolutely no sense and I was ready to fall asleep. Some scenes were scary, but without a structured story and intelligible story, I got lost and bored pretty fast. By the way, what in the hell is that little dragon toy thing. I know it has something to do with the possession, but of course I don't know what it has to do with the possession. That's the problem.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Awesome acting through awesome directing really shows, though a bit longer than it needs to be. Would have been ridiculous to see in the 70s.","I finally watched the Exorcist to see what the hype was about, and I think I see. A few things that impressed me-Psychologically driven horror versus terror/slasher. I was expecting pure demonic fantasy but it's a more grounded and ""real"" than that.-Visibly awesome directing. The acting is great from children and adults alike in extreme reactions and portrayal of fear and disgust.-Kooky creative horror and SFX, still passable and surprising by today's standards.-Some great cinema. I liked the shots, especially many of the medical device shots which purely of their photography produce fear.

I have never been a fan of horror films anyway, but I have always avoided this one knowing that it was nasty.I really was surprised by how much I enjoyed it, the performances were generally very good and although the special effects were quite dated, they were still gross and disturbing and Linda Blair was just vile.

The best horror film ever made,"The Exorcist is one of the scariest films of all time and in 1973 it was a smash hit and now it is a movie that people even today are talking about and you can't call your self a horror fan unless you have seen this classic. the plot follows two priests who attemt to stop a demonic presence in a 12 year old girl and one of the younger priests questions his faith and must trust in his faith to stop this demon.
the cast includes Ellen Burstyn,Max von Sydow,Lee J. Cobb,Kitty Winn,Jack MacGowran,Jason Miller and Linda Blair it's a great cast and they work so well together and Linda Blair gives a amazing preformace as the possesed girl.
Personally I love the exorcist and I think that it is one of the best horror films of the 70s and all time and it was before any of the horror movie cliché's of horrror movies from the 80s which uses cliché's quite a bit so overall it was a ground breaking film and will always be amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Shocking and startling conceptual horror, once it gets going","Chris MacNeil (Burstyn) is horrified when her daughter starts acting strangely and when all medical treatment provides no answers; she considers the possibility of exorcism.William Friedkin's Exorcist is marvelled by many in today's modern culture as being the revamp of horror, a marvel and a wonder with 2 Oscar triumphs and plenty of other nominations to name, but it certainly takes a while for all the accolades to kick in.Opening with a well shot archaeological dig in Iraq, we see a content looking man gazing face to face with a strange statue that fades away into the familiar American shot. Back on land we are invited into the troubled life of actress Chris MacNeil who is having trouble with her career and looking forward to returning home.When reading reviews, I found this to be one of the most horrific things to grace the screen and a shock to the system but the first hour, is perhaps the most boring and flat scene-setting you will ever see. MacNeil is having trouble, and she has a great relationship with her daughter and it's all very cosy etc, so where is this supposed tag and critical praise going to kick in? 10 years before The Exorcist Alfred Hitchcock released a shocking and brilliant film receiving an Oscar nomination known as The Birds. What the director did was skilfully place the creatures into the story juxtaposed with Tippi Hedren's protagonist and the suspense and tension were well matched against the excitement and fear factor that it was a true convincing and masterful piece of movie-making. Here we have a boring family situation along with a depressed priest that just brings the mood down rather than create a feeling of drama and suspense.But thankfully after an unbearable first hour the tension is notched up a gear with the introduction of a demon spirit into MacNeil's daughter Regan (Linda Blair) and we have an exciting and different prospect on our hands. The foul mouthed being is certainly a catalyst of evil that generates tension between the characters and sparks one of the most controversial issues today, science against religion.Back in 1973 when this was released, medicine was certainly restricted and the ongoing belief in God and Jesus Christ was as high on people's minds as it is today and the scripted dialogue impressively weighs the battle in a shocking manor, that suggests after all science fails, try religious exorcism. Very controversial and very well justified.Thankfully the second part of the film creates plenty of action and suspense to weigh the excitement and mystery of Regan's demon and there are plenty of shocking twists along the way to up the ante right until the unforgiving final scenes.After an atrocious start, The Exorcist generates thrills and spills in controversial ideologies that are definitely worth waiting around for",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Powerful and Novel Approach to Horror Cinema,"Oddly, it's sometimes the repulsiveness of imagery that surpasses ""horror,"" becoming captivating in its revoltingness. This contrary advantage of primeval effect is the core of Friedkin's vision. Regan's thrashings are ugly, ferocious, but they've such effect on us since it's seen: Friedkin directs the viewpoint of these moments from the point-of-view of those seeing.And each setting's especially natural. This is also what made Jaws so exciting. No Transylvanian mansion with thunder, lightning. Throughout the whole scene between Burstyn and Cobb's detective, there's a deathlike silence. Just their voices, the sporadic tinkle of a cup. This amplifies our sensations. Burstyn's agitation becomes ours. Seconds after Cobb departs, Friedkin stuns the tautness with a piercing clatter and Regan's shouts. Burstyn dashes inside the room to terrified astonishment as books, papers, records, toys orbit hysterically.Visually plot items are realized with that contrary entertainment. Friedkin augments the authenticity of these scenes by not underscoring them. The dialogue, sounds, images bring the effect. And Friedkin knows how to develop to that dreadful pragmatism. Firstly, Regan says her bed shakes. We glimpse a black-and-white photograph of her, adding plain uneasiness to her pose. When she urinates on the floor at the party, the abnormality becomes visual. Seeing's believing.Friedkin intensifies each new shock, culminating in the masturbation, surely the most powerful moment due to the degree of debasement. We're constrained to watch, as Friedkin's wicked advantage is the lure of unspecified dread brought alive. Friedkin creates apprehension with his first image, black-and-white sunrise dissolving to an overwhelming orange. One practically feels the gleaming surges of heat. At the archaeological site, picks strike soil, sounds intensifying, shriller still when Von Sydow trembles finding the talisman.Apprehension becomes conflict. Von Sydow informs the keeper that he must leave. Then, he's almost run down by a black horse and carriage, a malevolent forewarning. Friedkin visually achieves a sensation that something horrific's impending. Von Sydow searches through the ruins, and faces Pazuzu's massive, menacing statue. Dogs fight ferociously, the effigy rigid versus the wailing winds while Von Sydow's bowed figure stands in bold resolve, action illuminating character.The feeling of dread and fear lives not just in the shadows but in broad daylight. Friedkin dissolves to barking neighborhood dogs in the damp gray over Georgetown, the bedroom of Burstyn, who hears bizarre scraping from her attic. Friedkin's taken us to a climax, a fearsome, unrestrained world, then deposits like a ride, gets underway again to the next climax. In illustrating the bizarre but accurate, the biological and cognitive potential justify the possession, also utilized to exciting, vile effect.As each medical option's reduced, the tension mounts as we see the possession intensify, causing Friedkin's attaining our surrender, agreement. Burstyn's sure Regan necessitates a priest. Burstyn's portrayed, basically, as an atheist, though her passion in this situation persuades us that she's certain her daughter's definitely possessed. The horrors begin in ordinary settings. Once we behold the cross masturbation, Friedkin's taken us from leg-pullers like attic scratchings to Regan's vicious, outlandish doings.Screams intensify tension, topping scenes emotionally. Friedkin employs sound as character. We're pacified fleetingly by silence, then the scream shocks. The distinction from tranquility to disorder in the dream sequence has the upshot of thrashing us instantaneously from relative comfort to a animal anxiety.Moreover, the handling of light contrasts is effective for its paradoxes. As in the dream, silver medal strikes black rock, cut to Regan in a vibrantly lit examination room, an icon of righteousness descending onto blackness, contrasted with Regan's hideous exploit in the barren luminosity. Familiarities such as tennis-playing students juxtaposed with Inspector consulting Miller about church defilements and McGowran's bizarre demise. Even in the daytime terror of the masturbation a gloomily shadowed image crowns the moment before the subsequent luster. Friedkin's most dazzling paradoxical disparity's in Von Sydow's re-emergence, a black outline in the lone gleam, wearing all black, invigorating the impression of wickedness Friedkin's founded, handsome visualizations assuming threatening connotations.The possession's cruelty is directly counter to Miller's vulnerability-become-power-via-selflessness. When he's introduced, he's visiting his mother in a dilapidated apartment. Her delight at seeing him is unadulterated, but he's swarming with self-reproach. He advises other priests but thinks he's losing his faith. When his mother dies, his remorse crushes. Nevertheless, despite private difficulty and misgiving, he does battle for a stranger. While he's not swayed it's a possession, Miller acquires the bishop's consent to do an exorcism. To Miller's disenchantment, Bishop thinks it best to have a man with practice: Von Sydow exorcized a demon years ago in Africa. Friedkin again expresses that Von Sydow and the demon are deep-rooted enemies, from their confrontation in the ruins to Regan's manifestation intensifying with Von Sydow's entrance.Friedkin advocates no principles, just illustrates the dismay defeated via fierce eradication. Nevertheless, it's the majestic shock of Miller's ultimate revelation and sacrifice that outdoes ""horror,"" becoming enlivening. It's all the power of a twilight sky observed through a nihilistic lens.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Classic Horror Films Series.,"The Exorcist (1973) was one of the greatest horror films ever made. It scared the nation and the people wanted more! The movie made a lot of money and it launched William Friedkin's career beyond the stratosphere (he was already a big name thanks to the French Connection). William Peter Blatty's novel was already a big seller when it was optioned for a silver screen adaptation. The conflicts between the two over how it would be presented as a film could make a movie by it's own right. There was as much action behind the scenes as there was in front of the camera.The story is about a priest who's at an ancient Sumerian archaeological excavation site. Father Merrin has been following the presence of an ancient evil deity named Pazul. He confronted it some time ago and is still haunted by it. At the same time, a young adolescent Georgetown resident is communicating with someone named Captain Howdy. Is their a connection? Meanwhile a middle aged priest is having disturbing dreams and doubts about his chosen profession of living a life of poverty as a priest. Are all these stories in some way connected? One must find out when watching The Exorcist!I am a fan of this classic. The behind the scenes tensions made this movie. The cast was excellent and William Friedkin was on the ball (Unlike most of his films after this one). The creepy ""Tubular Bells"" was an appropriate choice for the film's soundtrack. The Exorcist revived the career of Max Von Sydow and made a star out of Linda Blair. Watch it and you'll find out why it scared so many and stirred up a lot of emotions from the religious right and the moral majority. A true classic!Highly recommended!Like all successful films that came out of Hollywood, the Italians and a lot of lower tier American studios couldn't resist and cloned this movie to death. Some are good and others are pretty atrocious. The Italian film industry was saved by making knockoffs and parodies of this movie. I guess the so called ""spaghetti westerns"" were dead.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Good, but overrated. Read the book instead.","Maybe it's because I didn't see it in theatres. Perhaps it's because of my age. It might even be because I had overly high expectations after reading the book. Whatever the reason may be, the fact is I don't think that this film is nearly as good as it's reputation would tell you. It is certainly a well-made film, all the actors involved are great, the effects aren't bad, and Friedkin directs the film superbly. I especially enjoyed the hidden ""faces"" that show up in numerous scenes. Is it scary? Not as far as I'm concerned it isn't. Perhaps a devout Catholic would think differently, but I wasn't frightened in the least. I don't believe in these occurrences, and that takes away any scare factor that there may have been, unless you're afraid of projectile vomit. Though the actors work well with what they have, the characters are all very flat. Very few of them are fleshed out, which is a shame. For a much better experience, read the book. The characters are all more fleshed out, more occurrences are explained, and it still leaves room for your beliefs.5.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A landmark among horror films???...I don't think so...,"THE EXORCIST was a novel I read years ago and never saw the film, disliking the novel too much. Not even all the hype about the movie could make me interested in going to see it and stories I heard about people getting sick from the shocking reality of the fright scenes.Now I've seen it on AMC (with all those annoying commercial interruptions), and I see that I wasn't missing anything. It starts out painfully slow (for a film regarded as a landmark among horror films), and only vaguely begins to suggest what is about to take place in the girl's bedroom. (It's based on the true story of a boy's possession, not a girl's). I guess they figured it would be racier if a girl was involved.ELLEN BURSTYN is the worried mother who is told her daughter has a chemical imbalance in her brain after the girl appears to be deeply disturbed by something. Of course, none of the doctors can explain why her bed was moving convulsively up and down--the first tip-off that this is indeed going to be a horror film. It's almost an hour into the movie before the girl's first big attack comes on and she has to be sedated. By that time, I felt like I had already had a tranquilizer myself.But from this point on, as medicine fails to pinpoint the girl's illness, the mother turns to the local church for guidance and the story begins to exploit the theme of possession. LINDA BLAIR is highly effective in her manic attacks and those around her seem to be in real danger of the demon possessing her. It's only until the middle of the movie that the word ""exorcism"" is even used by a doctor who suggests that the mother consider using it to rid her daughter of the spirit.The main shock appeal of the story (which made the book such a best-seller) begins as soon as Father Damien (JASON MILLER) begins the rituals--which, unfortunately, takes until midpoint in the film. By that time the viewer has mainly been treated to various glimpses of Georgetown and some pretty autumnal photography and a couple of cozy scenes with LEE J. COBB as a detective interested in a murder that took place near the girl's home. MAX VON SYDOW's entrance into the film is an impressive one, cinematically, as fog drifts around the Georgian brownstone and he shows up to assist Father Damien.While it's the snail pace of the story that defeats the film from the very beginning, it's this very fact that makes the actual exorcism scenes more shocking by contrast. And they do have shock appeal.ELLEN BURSTYN's drab looking mother is hardly the vision of a movie star who could stir LEE J. COBB into asking for an autograph. She looks about as downtrodden and upset as LINDA BLAIR in all of her garish green-paste make-up. Sure, THE EXORCIST is a shocking story but it now seems obviously contrived to upset anyone who hasn't heard of the practice of ""exorcism"" as practiced by the Catholic Church.Here, director Blatty exploits his theme with professional polish and theatrical effect--but it's still far from a landmark horror film, in my opinion. Why it became such a box-office smash, I've never been sure.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Sympathy for the devil on ice, folks!  And what is it about the name Damian?","My mom said that when ""The Exorcist"" first came out, she thought that it was the scariest thing that she'd ever seen (""The Shining"" later overtook it). When I saw the 2000 re-release...well, let's just say that you don't know intensity until you've seen that version! Since everyone knows what happens, I'll just talk about a few aspects. Nowadays, it's a little shocking to us that the opening scene happens in Iraq. Fr. Karras' (Jason Miller) first name is Damian, which was later the boy's name in ""The Omen"". I believe that it was around the time when this movie came out that Ellen Burstyn was active in the campaign to free Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter from jail.

The Exorcist is a disturbing tale of child possession. It's too bad it's not scary and boring to watch.,"Almost forty-five years old, The Exorcist is still a creepy and uncomfortable film to watch. This film revolutionized and practically created the demonic possession genre, which spawned some truly horrifying films. While The Exorcist is excellent at being creepy, it's never scary and almost boring to watch, dragging the whole way through and never reaching the peak of true horror.The Exorcist opens with Father Merrin overseeing an archaeology site in Iraq. While there he uncovers a relic that is said to hold the ancient demon, Pazuzu. This causes him to experience an omen and forces him to return to the United States. From here we cut to Georgetown, where Chris Macneil and her twelve-year-old daughter, Regan, are residing. Chris is a famous actress and a devoted mother. Strange happenings begin to occur around the house and Regan starts to exhibit supernatural traits such as speaking in a dead language and bending her body into impossible positions. Doctors cannot explain what has come over her, which leads them to conclude that she may be possessed. Chris seeks the help of a priest, Father Karras, to perform an exorcism on Regan.There is tons of body horror and bloody imagery that will make you want to look away for a couple of seconds. Director William Friedkin highlights every excruciating detail and never holds back as he forces us to helplessly watch as a little girl is tortured by a demon.The film chooses to take the slow road when it comes to storytelling and delivering the scares. While the pace allows for the characters to fully develop, it also lessens the effects of the scares and gives us too much of a break between each one. The same formula is used throughout, which consists of fifteen minutes of dialogue and then twenty seconds of scares. It gets predictable after a while, making the film become boring and easy to anticipate. The film also never reaches its full potential of being scary. It's definitely creepy, but never scary enough. From a film that is regarded as the scariest ever, it's disappointing that I was not scared once.The effects here are truly spectacular and push the boundaries of what can be shown on screen. Regan's transformation is truly horrifying to watch as her body almost decomposes. The makeup and demonic voice- over by Mercedes McCambridge are incredible and make us feel more fearful of what Regan has become. The special effects used for the body horror sequences are exceptionally done, with the best shot coming when Regan's head turns 360o and foams with blood.The acting and characters are not as good as it could have been and don't add anything memorable. Ellen Burstyn is average at best as Chris. We watch as she deals with losing her daughter to a force that no one can explain. While Burstyn does an alright job, the character of Chris just isn't that good. I never felt anything for her and didn't care what happened to her. Linda Blair does an excellent job of portraying Regan. She plays both the innocent girl and the demonic spirit really well. We fear for her safety as she becomes helplessly trapped inside her own body. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow do a respectable job as Fathers Karras and Merrin, but just like Burstyn, they suffer from being bad characters. They each have backstories that are unneeded that deviate too much from the central story.The Exorcism is an interesting and grotesque film to watch because of its troubling subject matter and horrible imagery. It delivers a few creepy shots and moments, but it never reaches its full abilities in terms of horror.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Decades Later, The Exorcist Still Scares the Devil Out of You!","Set in Georgetown, The Exorcist narrates the tale of a glamorous household in the neighborhood, where the 12 year old daughter Regan (Linda Blair) of a popular actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) begins to exhibit bizarre behavior and suddenly grows sullen and incredibly foul-mouthed, leading to her transformation into a deformed and dangerous imitation of herself - a scar-faced, burning- eyed, profanity-spewing monster. After numerous medical examinations come up with no explanation for her condition, Chris in desperation turns to exorcism and a Jesuit priest Damien Karras (Jason Miller) who is going through a crisis of faith, must determine if the child is in fact possessed and requires an exorcism. After learning about the case from Chris and avuncular police detective Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) and after seeing Regan's head-whirling, crucifix- abusing, green vomit routines, he is convinced that inhabiting poor Regan's body is none other than the devil himself and calls in an elderly, experienced exorcist, Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow). The core of the movie is Regan's subsequent exorcism, so cold that plumes of frost expel with every breath and so rancid with terror that audiences even today tremble at the sight.This jolting tale of a 12-year-old girl possessed by the devil might sound like your run-of-the-mill horror movie, but The Exorcist, with its hypnotic narrative grip, deepens the emotional pool. Based upon the acclaimed 'true life' novel by William Peter Blatty, who in turn adapted it into a screenplay; it was brought to life with uncompromising force by director William Friedkin, going all out in this portrayal of purity possessed by demonic forces. Here, Friedkin does not rush the proceedings, but rather he takes his time establishing mood, character, and heart thumping suspense which leads to some truly terrifying and effective scares - a bloody medical procedure, the sight of putrefying flesh, a blasphemous child stabbing her crotch with a crucifix; the subsequent 180 degree swiveling of her head; and a spider walk down a staircase which concludes with a blood curling scream.Today, it's not only a pop-culture conversation piece but a bona- fide classic, a finely crafted thriller that benefits immensely from its controlled direction, a thematically fruitful script, startling makeup designs, amazing special effects, an eerie score and an incredible cast that registers uniformly bravura performances. Its philosophical slant drives a deep wedge between it and other films of its ilk, which do not have the intelligence or substance to tackle such themes, as this movie so cleverly does. For this reason, The Exorcist not only tops the horror genre but transcends it, resulting in a profound experience. Decades later, it continues to exert its demonic spell!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Demonic warfare is REAL.,"Demonic warfare is REAL. This is based on a true story and the pictures prove it. While many people would most certainly list The Exorcist as THE scariest movie ever made, there seems to be a growing number of fans who find humor where it was not intended. I don't get it. Maybe it's a generational thing, but The Exorcist remains as effective today as it was in 1973. If the story of a young, helpless girl being turned into a snarling creature isn't horror enough, add to that the desecration of sacred religious symbols and you've got something quite shocking. Beyond the story, the strong performances by a good cast really help put The Exorcist over the top. Max von Sydow was never better. And the performance of an incredibly young and inexperienced Linda Blair is nothing short of remarkable. A.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Exorcist,"Excellent adaptation of Blatty's superb novel by director William Friedkin. The more I watch it, the more scared I become. The beginning of the film may drag for some, but it is an important element to the story, so try and stay tuned. The cast is awesome. Burstyn is flawless as the mother constantly in peril. Miller, Von Sydow and legend Lee J. Cobb are also in top form. Blair is menacing, but it is the voice of Mercedes McCambridge that adds the horror. The special effects send constant chills up your spine throughout the entire picture. Followed by 2 sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
What was all the Fuss about ??.,"After many years wondering what The Exorcist was like, I got to see it broadcast on UK Television for the 1st time ever here!.  The atmosphere and acting were strong throughout, but I was somehow left wondering what all the fuss was all about ??.  Much like my intial viewing of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I was at a loss as to the press attention the film has had through the 28 years of it's existence. I can only assume that alot of people felt offended by this film as it challenges their own religion and beliefs on screen ?.

Hallmark Cinema!,"Adapted from the 1971 novel of the same name by William Peter Blatty and based on the exorcism case of Robbie Mannheim, 'The Exorcist ' is a terrific film, that is eerie, thought-provoking & challenging!'The Exorcist' is about a young girl dealing with the demonic possession and her mother's desperate attempts to win back her daughter through an exorcism conducted by two priests respectively.William Friedkin is a proficient storyteller, and his body of work proves that. 'The Exorcist' is his finest attempt as a storyteller and observer. More than being a horror cult-favorite, it's a film that questions our beliefs and disbelief's. It has an outstanding start, middle & end.Linda Blair's portrayal as a possessed soul, is exemplary. A legendary performance that not only haunts you, but also makes you empathize the person suffering within. Ellen Burstyn is superb as the desperate/shattered mother. Jason Miller is fabulous in his part.On the whole, This Truly is Hallmark Cinema! An Outstanding Cinematic Achievement! Two Big Thumbs Up!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A horror masterpiece,"What can be said about this unsurpassed horror masterpiece that hasn't already been said? Perhaps the fact that it is so grounded in realism makes it the perennial kind of its genre. Some may look to the themes it so masterfully explores whether it be religion, faith, humanity, philosophy or ethics that puts it on a pedestal by itself. The spine-tingling score, one of the most memorable villains of all-time, the ominous pacing of the film - all reasons that separate this film as one of the single greatest horror films ever made.As for the performances? They are all superb and each are vitally important to the film, since so much of it is the build-up of plot, characters and setting. In fact, the titular event doesn't even occur until much later than one would think. And this is because we have a director in William Friedkin who trusts his audience to be patient in understanding the ambiguity (a little paradoxical) of the subject matter at hand. As one doctor after another continues to feed BS diagnoses to Chris MacNeil, Friedkin forces us to confront our biggest fear: the unknown. Author Andrew Smith once wrote: ""People fear what they don't understand and hate what they can't conquer.""Linda Blair as Regan MacNeil delivers one of the most chilling performances of all-time, transforming from a sweet, innocent and cheerful little girl to the definition of evil incarnate. The images of her slowly degrading condition have that raw power to stay so firmly entrenched in your mind. Ellen Burstyn as Chris MacNeil tragically conveys a mother clinging to whatever hope she has left in saving her doomed daughter. Max von Sydow and Jason Miller also give memorably powerful performances as the two Fathers, Lee J. Cobb is superb as Lt. Kinderman - to single out just one person out of this superb ensemble performance would be fatal, every individual in this film is superb!With images that have that rare power to subside and remain in your memory, The Exorcist is that special film that succeeds in being so realistic with subject matter that can be considered far from. The only other perfect horror film I can recall seeing (at least in my humble opinion) is Psycho. And though you can't compare apples and oranges, the images, music and deeper themes portrayed from both somehow manage to just stay with you; there's no other way to really put it. The Exorcist transcends the horror genre and becomes an experience, with images of beauty and terror that can never be forgotten. A deserved title of being deemed a 'classic'.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unforgettable,"I've heard of this movie through my entire life, but I had not seen it until a few a weeks ago. For a movie that is almost forty years old, I'm still thinking about it. There are many words that can describe ""The Exorcist"". Enchanting. Brilliant. Frightening. Intense. Powerful. Creative. Disturbing. Shocking. These are just a few words that come to mind.The story is simple enough. Innocent girl possessed by a demon. But what makes ""The Exorcist"" different from any horror film is that it's not about blood and gore like most slasher films, and there are characters we care about, rather than just a bunch of airheads in which we tend to find ourselves rooting for the villain to slaughter them. Yes, there is plenty of disturbing scenes throughout ""The Exorcist"", but it's a character-driven film. That's what I really enjoyed about this movie.All the performances are brilliant. Ellen Burstyn perfectly conveys the tension and fear a mother would experience during such a horrific supernatural event. Max Von Sydow (who's only in the movie for about twenty minutes) gives a performance that should've won him an Oscar. He conveys the sense of hope in the film. His words, ""The power of Christ compels you!"" still rings in my mind.Jason Miller expresses the sadness and imperfection that every person experiences, which is particularly unique since his character is a priest. And I can't forget Linda Blair as the little girl who's possessed. Even though Mercedes McCambridge did the voice of the demon (a voice that I will never forget), Blair's facial expressions and actions throughout the film as she transforms from good to evil is nothing short of perfect. And the fact she did this role at such a young age should've also garnered her an Oscar.The other aspect I cannot overlook in this film is the technical feats. As an individual whose just finished learning video production, I found the works of cinematography, editing, and sound design to be top-notched, even by today's standards. I mean, the filmmakers made a bed float in the air before the invention of CGI! That cannot be beaten. And the whole ""Exorcist"" sequence, well, I'll just say I could not keep my eyes off of the screen. I've now have come to appreciate William Friedkin as a legendary director for pulling off such a brilliant film.This movie won 2 Oscars back in 1974 for adapted screenplay and sound. Yet again, another superior film has been screwed over by the academy. I try not to put much stock in awards, but ""The Exorcist"" is a rare jewel that should not have been so sourly overlooked. This may be a horror film, but it's not like any other one. There's plot, characters, symbolism, and important messages of self-sacrifice and the presence and triumph over unimaginable evil. Of all the words I've used to describe this film, there is one that can sum it up. Unforgettable.****/****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An aboslute classic of horrror, The Exorcist is probably one of the most powerful testaments of faith and hope in film history. A truly masterpiece.","Considered a forerunner of the possession horror subgenre, The Exorcist is based on William Peter Blatty's book, which was inspired by the 1949 real case about a 14-year-old boy. In the film, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), is an actress who notices a strange and macabre behavior in Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) her 12-year-old daughter. She then asks for help from Father Karras (Jason Miller), who is also a psychiatrist. When he discovers that the girl is possessed by the devil, the priest then enlists the help of Father Merrin (Max von Sydow), who has experience in performing exorcisms, in order to save the girl from the terrible possession.A milestone in cinema history, the production, today, has an archetypal character, serving as an inspiration for several horror films that try to follow its model: an initially behaved child, who, in the presence of an evil entity, begins to show strange behavior, and later, it is possessed, bringing panic and horror to the surface for those closest to them, whether parents, family and/or friends. Director William Friedkin orchestrates one of the best-orchestrated horror shows in film history. The Exorcist was the first production of its kind to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and was awarded eight other nominations, winning two: Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound. The film was also nominated for a BAFTA for best sound, and was also at the important Golden Globe Awards, where it won four statuettes: best film - drama, director, supporting actress for Linda Blair and screenplay.In this classic from 73, we are gradually taken on a journey through the characters, creating suspense around the girl's behavior, and with a creative direction that manages to bring a macabre and hopeless tone around the story, well-seasoned with cynical moments and dialogues. Of black humor, a trademark of director Friedkin. Throughout history all alternatives are eliminated until the case of possession is assumed, giving various points of view around Regan. There is also a subplot of the priest that develops and intersects with that of the girl, showing the motivations and dramas of Karras' life, who lost her mother recently and is doubtful about her faith and full of fears. The only thing, however, is that Father Merrin works very little, lacking many deeper details about his life dramas, which are only briefly mentioned in the final act, this being the only and worrying slip that the film suffers.With an elaborate plot divided into three well-assembled acts, the first focuses on presenting the characters, their dramas and mysteries, the second takes all the arcs to a deeper and stronger deepening and the secrets are gradually revealed and from there on to the third act, composed of the climax filled with despair and surreal terror. The film also demonstrates a realistic atmosphere, full of symbolism and implicit questions, which yield several analyzes and interpretations after the end of the film. The good use of symbolism and the impeccable soundtrack further enhance what is being built, bringing memorable scenes that endure as cinematic landmarks. No wonder the entity mocks sacred artifacts, turning over and desecrating their symbology just to show human frailty before their strength. Speaking of entity, its transformation is demonstrated early in the plot, but it doesn't lose the terror as the narrative goes by, showing all the strength it has in building its landmarks. The film still features unusual camera sets, and impeccable photography, apathetic and somber, which matches the atmosphere presented.The film takes its own time to tell us its story, bringing a growing and exhausting problem that manages to exhaust us psychologically and physically, while adapting what needs to be narrated. It's not uncommon to come out of the film exhausted, which leaves us as frail and broken as its characters. Friedkin's direction is concerned with showing his daily life, playing with the audience and leaving us doubtful if we really saw, what happened until any logical solution is erased from our minds and we are so immersed in his narrative that we no longer find a way out. Part of this is due to the presence of Willian Peter Blatty in the production. The author of the original work was able to masterfully translate his terror into the screenplay, bringing all the beautiful construction of suspense, in small steps that will enhance the narrative. Friedkin's direction, on the other hand, bets on as much realism as possible, taking advantage of the deep dynamics and taking not only the audience, but the cast to the extreme.Every character in this movie seems to have some horror in their lives. Damien Karras (brilliantly played by Jason Miller) is an accomplished psychiatrist who decided to become a priest, thus refusing all the glory and money his knowledge could bring. Now that his mother is sick, he cannot afford treatment and begins to question his faith as he sees her die. When he is called upon to investigate the case, and gather the evidence to request an exorcism from the Vatican, he too has to face the skeletons Pazuzu wants to pull out of his closet. Lankester Merrin (Max von Sidow) is an elderly priest who has faced the devil once, and who lives like a human at the prospect of having to face him again. Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is a famous actress, abandoned by her husband, whose biggest goal in life is to raise her daughter Regan (Linda Blair, in a role she has never been able to let go of).Regan is the character that stands out in this web. She is a happy and smiling child, perhaps the only one who really sees a zest for life. That's why the devil chooses her. Possessed by an ancient entity called Pazuzu (voiced by Mercedes McCambridge) she begins to rot and deteriorate, physically and spiritually. Pazuzu stirs up, causes doubt, conquers souls little by little, instead of just blowing everything up. She would rather try to seduce Karras than loosen the straps that bind him to the bed, when he could make them disappear on his own. The true father of lies, cunning, cruel, treacherous. The director does an excellent job of connecting Regan with the audience. The character is pleasant, friendly and kind. Linda Blair's acting is also very good. The scales from character development to possession are very clear and this is due to the work of the actress and the patience that the film has.William Fridkin's direction is fabulous. The first 10 minutes of the film are spectacular from a photography and directing point of view. William Friedkin, through very few lines, shows the audience everything they need to know about a certain object that will be important later in the film. After this sequence, the film spends some time showing the day-to-day life of Chris - played by Ellen Burstyn -, and, in this part, Friedkin seems to be in his comfort zone. It uses open planes that zoom in on the character that wants to be shown. It is a resource used even with a certain exaggeration in Operation France. As the film gets heavier and more tense, the director shows his ability to handle the situation. He uses some long shots that work really well with some situations that the character's deal coolly and rationally, when they should be just trying to help Regan and Chris, and on top of that, he does some beautiful framing. The director manages to construct not just one, but several anthological sequences that remain in the popular imagination to this day: masturbation with a crucifix, the bed shaking insanely, Regan descending the stairs in the opposite way, her head turning 360 degrees, the profane words uttered by possessed Regan, the levitation in bed, the vomit (a production-enhanced pea soup), the fight between Pazuzu and Karras, and of course, the scenes involving the famous staircase in Geogetown are just a few of the production's iconic moments.The film's direction of photography is well applied in its unusual camera movements and apathetic colors, and a somber shade of blue that grows as the plot approaches its climax and final act, all of which suits the insane and insane concept very well. Terrifying story. When commenting on makeup and effects, it is necessary to put yourself at the time of production to better take advantage of the way they are applied in the transformation of the girl, the film does not bring realistic effects because this is not the focus of the production, but the cause feelings of disgust and disturb the mind and eyes of those who follow the film. However, many decades later, the film works very well to this day thanks to the brilliant work of the production team.As was to be expected in a production that involves the devil, O Exorcista has an extensive and mythological history in the panel of cinematographic productions of the 20th century. Several urban legends emerged and behind-the-scenes factoids were turned into documentaries, some of them claiming that during the recordings, malignant manifestations were responsible for deaths, disasters and delays that occurred in a mysterious way. Nine people were killed in strange circumstances, victims of falls, assaults and illnesses, in addition to locations that suffered fire. The production still collects another controversy: it was sued by Mercedes McCambridge, voice actor for the demonic voice of the character Regan. The professional claimed to have smoked about six packs of cigarettes a day, in addition to eating raw eggs and smoked apples, seeking the ideal voice, the most frightening possible, seeing the absence of her name in the credits as a lack of respect from those involved in the production.Much has been said about The Exorcist as one of the most terrifying movies of all time. Many have called it a demonic movie. The Exorcist is probably one of the most powerful testaments of faith and hope in film history.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
50th anniversary and still chilling,"This classic shocker about demonic possession holds up not only as a potent horror film, but one of the great films of the 1970s. (50th Anniversary this year!). William Peter Blatty adapted his own novel and retained not only the graphic terror, but, crucially, the character build up and the moral and spiritual undertones.Friedkin's film spends the time to focus on the four main characters: Father Merrin (a superb Max Von Sydow playing decades older than he was at the time; credit Dick Smith's make-up, too), Father Karras (an excellent Jason Miller), the cursed thirteen year girl targeted by the devil, Regan (a vulnerable Linda Blair*), and her mother, Chris MacNeil (an intense Ellen Burstyn). The emphasis on the individuals sets up the grim dread that ensues. It's what elevates the film from so many of the ripoffs and wannabees that have been made since (with a new one on the way). Too many took the lesson to be that it was all about bloody crucifixes and projectile vomit and not about the human beings caught up in the living nightmare. Indeed, the scene that most horrified some viewers was the spinal tap and not the possession sequences. The full cast is spot on including Kitty Wynn, Tito Vandis, Jack MacGowran and the great Lee J. Cobb as Det. Kinderman.The technical aspects are top notch from Owen Roizman's cinematography to Bud Smith's editing (subliminal cuts and all) to Marcel Vercoutere's special effects to the grueling sound mix (theater employees in the lobby supposedly were effected by the soundtrack even without seeing the movie).

It really doesn't have much more than shock value going for it, and the strength of that has faded a great deal in the thirty-odd years since its release. The psychological aspects of the picture are about on the level of Dr. Phil (I thought Exorcist III was much more engrossing in this area).

"Is this really ""The Scariest Movie of All Time??""","For me, yes. The Exorcist is easily one of the best horror films. Period. It is truly brilliant in every way. Some people pass it off as having cheap scares, bad effects and so on. People seem to forget that back then they didn't have such top-notch effects. The scares in this movie aren't cheap, either, they are genuinely scary. Be it the insanely creepy score, the white, demonic face that appears or suspense that is built up, almost the whole movie is scary. The acting is top-notch from everyone. To mention names would be unfair as every actor does such a good job. The fact that Jason Miller, Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair were overlooked at the Oscars is a travesty.There is really no need to explain the plot, as every fan of the cinema should know of it.Now, to today's movie-goer this would seem boring and out-dated. This is because this has no gore or sex. This movie relies on psychological thrills. It's all about character development and tension. And no other horror (apart from Hitchcock's Psycho) does it better. Regan's change from normal girl to demonic child is brilliant. By the time a damaged Father Karras arrives she is taken over.Now, to the scare factor. For me, this rates 10/10. The demonic face that appears throughout is enough to give nightmares for weeks (it sure gave me nightmares)!! Some of the sounds and words that come out of Regan's mouth are frightening and chilling. The head-twisting scene, the spiderwalk and the crucifix scenes are all disgusting and un-nerving. But William Friedkin handles them with confidence. He really does a brilliant job as director, I'm amazed he didn't win the Oscar. Thank God the sound did, though, as the score was amazing.I could go on and on about this, but I won't. I will just finish by saying, this is an extraordinarily good movie.5/5.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Be Gone ... to the theatre,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Back in the theatre 27 years after the initial release, and everyone with any interest should spend the $7.00 and check this out the way it was meant to be seen.  This was William Friedkin's third consecutive, and last, great film (after ""Boys in the Band"" and ""French Connection"".  Anyone under 35 years old can't understand the controversy and impact of this film on its original release. The giggles and laughter in the theatres are typically from those movie-goers who historically jump and scream everytime some clown in a hockey mask reappears to hack someone to death. If this is not your first time, pay special attention to Jack Nitzche's musical score.  Nitzche, who died this year, composed music for some wonderful films including ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", ""Stand By Me"", ""Starman"", and ""The Hot Spot"" (one of personal favs).He had an uncanny ability to capture the essence of the film in his music.  Also admire Jason Miller's marvelously understated performance as Father Karras.  He is now known as Coach Ara Parseghian in ""Rudy"". It is also fun to watch for some ""set bloopers"" (items misplaced or moved between scenes).  A couple of tidbits from this one: the writer, William Peter Blatty also co-wrote ""A Shot in the Dark"", the first Inspector Clouseau flick; and the composer, Jack Nitzche also co-wrote the 60's hit ""Needles and Pins"".",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worthy of its Notoriety -- A Monument of American Cinema and the Horror Genre,"Finally saw this infamous piece of cinematic history; saw ""The Version You've Never Seen"" edition, with which I am very satisfied, so I'm not sure if I'll go back to the original theatrical cut. From what I've read, there are some pretty radical changes in terms of previously-cut scenes being included in the film as well as changes to the soundtrack. I can't speak to any differences between these versions but I'll talk about what I did see.This version clocks in at nearly 2 hours and 15 minutes, and its pace could certainly be described as ""deliberate"" (or ""slow"" or ""snail-like"" if you're a little lacking in the patience department); but this is just fine with me, because I tend to find horror films with a deliberate pace and atmospheric build-up of tension to be more effective and unsettling. And this film is both of those things. I was consistently amazed by the subtlety, tightness, and intelligence of the cinematography. Many films from the 60s, 70s, and even 80s fail laughably at the notorious test-of- time -- but ""The Exorcist"" does not fall into company with these films. The camera work and editing is throughly modern; the special effects are surprisingly tasteful and realistic and still look good nearly three decades later; the score and soundscapes, unlike the often heavy-handed and even goofy musical choices and arrangements of early 70s horror (think Last House on the Left), are sparse and intentional, adding to the tense atmosphere and refusing to play the role of crass emotional cues; the acting is raw, honest, and believable -- all the lead roles (Burstyn, Blair, von Sydow and Miller) are impeccably and genuinely acted, and without this the film would not have worked.The intensity of the film relies on development of the characters and their relationships with each other; believable acting is a cornerstone of this film's punch. Bolstering this is the deft handling and juxtaposition of opposing feelings through the pacing of the film: at one moment we are seeing Burstyn's character in emotional distress as her motherly heart is torn by her daughter's insane behavior and the doctors' circular discussions about psychological disorders or Miller's young priest character struggling with how to use both his faith and medical knowledge to handle the strange case of Regan -- the next moment we may be accosted by the possessed Regan, violently clenching men's genitals without warning, spewing green vomit into a man of God's face, or emitting demon-voiced insults that won't be reproduced in writing here. The manic-depressive nature of the film is a psychological roller coaster that keeps us on the edge of our seats until the ultimate, gripping climax -- an extensive spiritual, psychological, and even physical battle between our heroic priests and the devil-child, as the fullness of the stylized exorcism ritual is performed in attempts to save the life of a young girl.""The Exorcist"" was ahead of its time in nearly every way imaginable. Whether it is pragmatics of filmmaking or the more esoteric--the questions about God, science/medicine, religion, society--this film confronted the audience with unease and uncertainty. Though many films since ""The Exorcist"" have followed its formula and taken freely from its milestone-setting creativity and ingenuity, few if any of them have approached this masterpiece: where ""The Exorcist"" plays with tropes without using them as a crutch, other horror films in this vein can't help but come off as contrived second- rate films attempts to be as effective as this unsettling tour de force of horror. Amid all of the controversy, boundless praise and damning criticism, this film stands as a monument of American cinema and of the horror genre. And it will get in your head like the devil himself.

Quite Chilling....Quite Effective,"Known more for its more lurid aspects such as a young Linda Blair vomiting green pea soup, spinning her head completely around, committing various acts of sacrilege and blasphemy, and spouting forth an incredible amount of graphic verbal vulgarity, The Exorcist is so much more than just those trademarks.  It is a disturbing psychological essay on human nature when confronted with a crisis.  It is a philosophical debate between evil and Religion.  It is an indictment on the world of science and what it supposedly knows, and a supporter of the supernatural, not only in the world of demons but also in the world of Religion.  It is above all a thinking picture fraught with visually nightmarish visions, strident and disturbing sounds, words and phrases, and ghastly contexts in which we the audience can examine our own beliefs both in the realm of the logical and the spiritual.The film boasts so many strong points such as a well-developed script that allows us to know each of the characters with some degree of intimacy.  We share in the pain of Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller.  The acting is first-rate.  Blair is very effective as the demonic child.  Mercedes McCambridge does an outstanding and incredibly eerie job voicing the demon. The real stars of the film are the two priests, played with dedication by both Max Von Sydow and Jason Miller.  Miller is the real catalyst in the film. The music is superb; the sets and shooting of Georgetown add both class and familiarity to the film.  Lee J. Cobb also does a  real nice job playing a movie-loving cop.  Despite the thinking elements in the film, the film is a shocker in many ways....bear that in mind as you sit down to watch.",,Anonymous,Horror

A classic movie but in 90's is a bore,"I confess, I was bored. Nothing didn't even remotely scare me or shock me in this movie. Nevertheless, I consider this to be a quality film: The Iraq scenes reveal a great cinematographer, the characters are deeper than the usual horror flick and by 1973 standards it has good visual and sound effects. Just don't compare it with REALLY scary films. Maybe it's a psychological study, but definitely not a thriller.

"The Best Film ever - Horror, Religion and the Faith in it all.","Ah, how times have changed.I saw this movie when it was first released widely in 1974. Back then in Hollywood Films, children didn't SAY or mouth the words the possessed Regan spews,(today many children say these words and more on TV and in film, so it's not so shocking) Priests were looked at as wise-old religious confidants, and it was rare to see a 'celebrity' single Hollywood Actress raising a child to boot! Challenging these norms is what makes ""The Exorcist"" film scary, the materialization of a demon/demons taking over a body of a pre-adolescent child makes it horrific and the real scriptures from a Christian Holy Book being conveyed with such force with the scary (again, for its time) special effects in a mainstream film made it spectacular.Before ""The Exorcist"", the epic Hollywood mainstream religious films with scripture and subsequent lessons were ""Ben Hur"" and ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Samson and Delilah"", ""The Robe"". Uplifting, true. But here was the start of, as many religious people put it, ""Satan getting more box-office than Jesus"". And not only was watching this child becoming slowly possessed was a problem, but so was watching the lives of those around here who would ultimately come together for not a happy ending.Make no mistake, this was a first in mainstream Hollywood film history. You had a man of the cloth who--sure--was questioning his faith, but you also saw he was as human as we all are. This Priest had problems with his family, problems with his faith, problems with how he was educated!! Wha--??!!You had an ""working actress"" trying to raise her child and be a good, attentive single mother at the same time.You had the hero of the film, an old Priest who retired to archaeological digs which in his young priesthood ago had a battle with a demonic spirit in Africa that he thought he ran off the face of the earth only to realize that it had re-located to a little girl's body.Then, you had a little girl who had problems of her own. She's growing up with no one to relate to, for her parents divorced, her father never continued a relationship with her, she's aware that her mother is having a ""relationship"" with the director of her film. She's changing... and the best solution they can come up with is grueling, seemingly barbaric test after test on her body and mind which would probably take its toll on anyone young or old.You put all this together with excellent direction, and an excellent script adaptation from its book, layers of STORY and character development and you have one of the best films of all time, ""The Exorcist"".Now, some 30 years later, one would consider 'scary' and 'horror' in film only so if it contained a lot of blood and guts and computer enhanced special effects. For its time, The Exorcist did it all by hand and it was spectacular. The Special Effects may look ""rinky-dink"" by todays standards, but its the religious inferences and WHY it was occurring on top of the effects that was horrific. I mean its one thing to see a child floating above a bed, but why she is, is what scares you.I do feel the more connected you are in the Christian Faith, is what may make this film horrific than most. Horrific good or Horrific bad. You have several battles here, you as a film goer pick and chose which one or none you care to believe but the bottom line is for all that this film presents, it does it well, provokes discussion and thought and I still haven't seen a film to match what ""The Exorcist"" has.One of the top 5 Films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Okay,"At the time of this movie's release people were terrified, I'd be terrified too because back then it's like the first of it's kind. But now in 2020, where the conjuring universe and other gazillion similar movies exist, this movie has a little to no impact on me, in fact, it makes me appreciate the conjuring movies even more. This movie is not scary, if anything it's disturbing. The exorcism scenes lasts for only 10 min or so and it's more gross than frightening, some pointless scenes like the opening scene in iraq. And it seemed like the Devil has no plan but to cuss and torture the poor girl. I prefer the none spiritual part of the movie, the first hour of the hospital and the treatment and all, they were my favorite part of the movie.However, it was well-acted, the special effects were nicely done, the score was fitting, the make-up was fantastic esp that of Father Merrin.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

""" Don't be deceived, there is only one demon within her. ""","There are not too many movies which have the power to achieve the unique status of Classic after it's initial showing in theaters. This is one of them. This film, "" The Exorcist "" written by Peter Blatty, enter the hearts, minds and souls in 1973 with so many opinions, reviews and predictions that nearly every media outlet was flooded with them. Upon entering the modern theater in that time and place, gave everyone a unexplained sense of foreboding. Potential audiences were warned not to see the film alone. The story is based on the mounting and unexplained hysteria of the time called manifested phenomenon. In simpler terms it was called 'possession.' The idea that a beast, demon or satanic monster could posses the body of an innocent victim sent shivers through the spines of believers. In this story we have the Vatican calling on an expert in demonology, one, Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow). He is assisted by local priest, Father Karras (Jason Miller) who originally investigates the strange happenings. The investigation attracts the eye of the local police who send Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) to acquire more details. But it is the young actress Linda Blair playing Regan who brings such bestial reality to her character, that in one scene I was terrified at what she could do with her head. I was forever affected and believed. The film garners many accolades and praises that it is unlikely that the film is anything but a true demonic classic. *****",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Exorcist,"I have no idea what I was thinking when I decided to do a project on ""The Exorcist"" for college. I don't like being scared, and avoid horror films religiously (pun unintended). I am scared of my own shadow. So the proper course of action when told I had to do a presentation on something, of any medium, that showed tropes of the American Gothic, was to go ahead and do it on what's considered by many as the scariest film of all time.My boyfriend (who will be addressed always as Himself), was delighted at the prospect of watching me squirm through a horror film. So we watched it on Valentine's Day. How romantic.""The Exorcist"" is based off the best selling novel of the same name, by William Peter Blatty. Blatty also wrote the screenplay and won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his efforts. It tells the story of a little girl named Regan McNeil (Linda Blair), who appears to be possessed by some malevolent demon. Her mother, actress Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is beside herself with worry, and, at the advice of medical professionals, goes to a trouble priest named Damien Karras (Jason Miller), to request an exorcism.The film is frightening, but not conventionally. The only jumpscare is that of the demon's face for a split second. No, this film is psychologically chilling. Yes, chilling. It effects you, deep down. One sees themselves within the demon, as the little girl struggling to cope. We identify with Karras, who is on the fence about his faith. We are in that freezing room covered in vomit; we are the strong priest who does not balk at the terror before him, we are the troubled Jesuit who does not know where to turn. We are the little girl in the bed, screaming obscenities; we are monsters.Father Merrin (Von Sydow) says to Karras upon him asking why such a malignant source would infect an innocent girl ""I think the point is to make us despair. To see ourselves as... animal and ugly. To make us reject the possibility that God could love us."" Roger Ebert also said that the film sits on the fence between cinematic escapism and reality, that it makes us look inside ourselves. This is what makes the film terrifying; the fact that it shows us humans at our worst. We are, at some stage, the demon and the conflicted priest, the frantic parent and the tortured girl.8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Scariest Film Of All Time? In A Way, Yes!","For the sheer magnitude of unrelenting terror that The Exorcist unleashed on its unsuspecting audience during its theatrical run back in 1973, the tag of ""the scariest film of all time"" sits perfectly well on this horror masterpiece. After all, there has never been an example in motion picture history which has affected the viewers as strongly as this film did for many fainted, threw up or went hysteric in a manner unlike anything witnessed before or after it.Looking back now, countless imitations & parodies over the years might have diminished its scare factor by a great deal but there's no denying that even today The Exorcist remains in a league of its own & is yet to find an equal. Succeeding not just as a genre-defining tale of demonic possession but also as a remarkable piece of superb storytelling with great character build-up & groundbreaking special effects, The Exorcist is very possibly the gold standard of horror filmmaking.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of The Exorcist takes place in the Georgetown area of Washington D.C. & concerns the 12-year old daughter of a famous actress, who begins manifesting some strangely disturbing behavioural changes in her personality. When science fails to offer any rational explanation, her mother turns to superstition in a desperate attempt to save her daughter's life & enlists the help of a troubled priest, who is struggling with his own faith.Directed by William Friedkin, the film opens with one of the most powerful, sinister & perfectly crafted prologues which apart from serving as a warning for things to come also sets up an extremely eerie mood for the rest of the film. Friedkin's work here is perhaps the finest of his career as the extent to which the director went in order to bring out the best from his cast & crew is well documented plus he left no stone unturned to make the experience as emotionally shattering as possible.The screenplay is penned down by William Peter Blatty, the author of the novel, and it is expertly balanced in all storytelling aspects. Cinematography makes brilliant use of slow zooms, panning, close-ups & sharp focus to immerse viewers into its demonic tale, use of music is effectively carried out, make-up & special effects end up adding a whole new chapter to filmmaking manuals and as far as editing goes, it paces the film ingeniously but is also marred by heavy amount of continuity errors.Coming to the performances, The Exorcist features a talented cast in Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason Miller, Max von Sydow & Lee J. Cobb. One amazing thing here is that the characters are wonderfully fleshed out in the script & the actors simply build their act on an already solid platform, delivering some high quality performances. Each character is properly introduced, their arc is elegantly handled & unlike most horror films of today, we do grow to care for these fictional lives on the screen.What continues to separate The Exorcist from most examples of its genre is that despite its extensive gore effects & disturbing premise, the main emphasis remains on telling a story rather than revel in its extremity, which ultimately makes the final showdown all the more bone- chilling & unforgettable. The horror it unleashes is absolutely brutal, difficult to watch & too heavy in content yet the extent to which this film pushed the boundary of horror cinema by exploring subjects no one before ever dared to venture in is no mere feat in itself.On an overall scale, The Exorcist is one of the most influential, unnerving & faith-shattering films ever made which opened the doors to our deepest fears back when it was released and is still capable of surprising the newcomers with its discomforting ambiance & themes, if not the now dated visceral horror. Immortal for its contribution to cinema & pop culture, memorable for the mass hysteria it caused, and admirable for its uncompromising & undeniably effective take on demonic possession, ""the scariest film of all time"" comes strongly recommended.",,Anonymous,Horror
"After 50 years, not quite as scary","Before the exorcism sub-genre became bloated and overdone there was the film that started it all. But how well does 1973's 'The Exorcist' hold up 50 years later?For a movie that became a cultural phenomenon (in a mostly negative way), William Friedkin's masterpiece is carefully executed in a way that helps set the ominous tone right from the get-go. The slow build-up to the third act feels yawn-inducing in parts, but there are also some important scene-setting moments that hold your attention. The relationship between Ellen Burstyn's panicked movie star mother Chris and the conflicted psychiatrist priest Father Karras is intriguing, and Max von Sydow has a command over the scenes he's in, starting from the very first one.While some of the content was shocking for a film of this era, it doesn't hold a candle to some of the things we see in movies nowadays (for better or worse). Still, it's truly unsettling and not surprising that 'Exorcist' had the effect it did back when it was released. Watching it today, however, doesn't feel quite as scary.It will always be a classic, but it is fair to say 'The Exorcist' has lost some of its luster over the years.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""The power of Christ compels you""","I cannot even fathom why I waited the nearly thirty-two years of my life to watch this classic. It was highly entertaining and I found it more terrifying than most of the horror movies released today.I've made the statement before. But there is something about older seventies, and eighties horror flicks that make them truly chilling, and eerily unique in their way.I think it's because of the realism of the backgrounds with relatively no contrast, or added effects. The comparisons to what people wore and how they behaved in everyday life back then. The exterior and interior houses, gritty paved streets, and remarkable cinematography. Unlike most of today's films that rely heavily on CGI to create spectacular imagery. However, they lack the heart and soul of olden-day techniques.It even feels like there is more passion in the theatrical performances. It was really difficult to find a standout but Ellen Burstyn, (Chris McNeil) and Linda Blair (Regan) showed brilliant on-screen chemistry as Mother and Daughter. Max Von Sydow, (Father Merrin) and Jason Miller (Father Karras) provided the most intense Exorcism that is currently unmatched and unrivaled in any other film ever produced in my opinion.Watching this film in a more modern time, you can't help but pick up some humorous moments. But I felt that there were also some truly shocking events, and phrases spoken that I'm amazed ended up in the finished product. I can understand why this film received heavy backlash back in the day. But hey, for entertainment purposes it must have been at the top of its game.I have to say this surprised the hell out of me. I was extremely impressed with The Exorcist, and rate it right up there with all the truly great classics of the horror genre.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Miss Possessed.,"This movie defines the meaning of being possessed, where teenage girl Regan (Linda Blair) is being controlled by a mysterious supernatural being. As a result, her mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) desperately seeks the help of two priests to save her daughter.This is an iconic and great piece of horror cinema with a lot of tension and thrills, from Regan acting bizarre and displaying out-of-character behavior to her being fully controlled by the demon, while her mother watches helplessly. The scenes where the priests, in a fit of frenzy and determination, try to save the uncontrollable Regan from the unholy creature will give you a frightening, yet edge-of-your-seat excitement.Filled with great acting, spectacular make-up, and a good dose of horror mixed in with tense, spiritual drama, this is a must-see for any horror movie fans.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Regan Meets Captain Howdy,"I don't get it. I really don't.At the very beginning of this film's grotesque and bleak story (at an excavation site in Northern Iraq), a small, ancient effigy representing a devil-like figure is uncovered amongst the ruins.This discovery somehow unleashes a demon-spirit which then inexplicably transports itself all the way over to the USA where it, for whatever reasons, takes possession of a 13 year-old girl, living in Georgetown.What I don't get is this - In Iraq the principal religion has always been Islam - So, with that in mind - What the hell good would Catholic priests performing a Christian exorcism do to help rid a girl of a demon that comes from a religion which doesn't even recognize Christianity? Eh? What good would it do?If nothing else - This decidedly heavy-handed horror story certainly made a total laughing stock out of the Catholic religion. For example - Here we had to contend with the extremely volatile and guilt-ridden character of Father Damian Karras (a real boozer) who was the chosen one, supposedly best suited to perform the exorcism ritual which was intended to de-demonize Regan.Personally, I cannot see why so much fuss has been made about this particular fright flick over these many years. Now 40 years old, The Exorcist has definitely lost a significant amount of its initial clout. In fact, I'd say that it was pretty laughable, in the long run.

I would put it in the Christian genre rather than the horror genre.

No the Devil Didn't Win,"There is 2 Versions of this film.

He did not talk to the director (William Friedkin) for years. The reason for the dispute was that Blatty thought that Friedkin cut too many scenes out of the film and made it look like ""Evil Had One"". For years on talk shows and public speaking tours Mr Blatty had to defend the film because many people though ""Evil WOn Out"". Finally after 20+year of pleading William Friedkin re-edited the film to include scenes that Blatty thought was needed. After he re-edited the film Director William Friedkin) agreed that Blatty had been right for all these years. The Re-edited Version is called ""The Version You've Never Seen"" and it is better but only slightly.Many people thought in the original version that ""The Devil Won"". This proves to me most people are stupid. If you look at the original ending the Priest Sacrifices Himself to save the girl.

The vomit shot or the head turning, but what you really remember from the film is the sound and the imagery.  Early in the film when Father Merrin visits a temple in Iraq, he confronts the statue of a demon.  Below him are dogs fighting, as he stares into the statue the dogs sounds become distorted and grotesque. They don't sound like dogs anymore.  The voice of the Devil haunts you for days after viewing the film.  So full of malice and vulgarities, it would be comical if deep in your mind you could separate the voice from the face. Put them together, and you'll still be making sure your windows and doors are locked tightly.  The final thing that follows you around is the ghost white face that appears in Father Karras' dream and in the exorcism of the Devil from Regan.  It only appears for a second, but that face lingers with you. It is not grotesque, but it is evil.  And it will haunt you, just watch the exorcism scene.

"Scary back then, but not now","This is an infamous film that's left a legacy of being imitated and proclaimed at one point and still by many as the scariest movie ever made. But not only is this movie not scary, it's boring and unintentionally hilarious. I know that people in the 70's had never seen anything like this before so I can somewhat understand why they'd enjoy this, but I've seen a lot of things and this movie tried its best to engage me and it never did. The first biggest problem is that it's a watershed film (a movie that's been imitated and copied), but unlike other similar films like Die Hard and Halloween that to this day yeah have elements that are familiar, still have enough creativity and enjoyment throughout to make them solid. This however poorly executes its ""creepy"" visuals, almost every time Reagan does something that's suppose to be disturbing, we never get time to let it sink in, instead as soon as something happens it cuts away to a scene where something completely separated is happening, it's like cutting away in the middle of an action sequence and than seeing the aftermath later, stupid. So the ideas don't hold up from being copied and not well executed, to the point where the demon came off more like a 12 year old kid yelling online about video games or something, just ridiculous. Now the extra salt on the wound is the fact that the second problem is its length, this 2 hour movie has one scene after another that just drags on for so long with characters taking forever to get to the dang point already, so the movie wastes your time through its majority runtime and the parts where a little time should be spent to really get involved in the scenes, they cut away from it immediately. And you can say it's well made and well acted or whatever but that only goes so far, I'm not ever angry at people who definitely put time and effort into the things that they make. And yeah the effects are still great but none of it matters when the movie did such a poor job at having me care about anyone, the detective didn't need to be in the movie, the mom didn't need to be in the movie (heck if Reagan was an orphan it really wouldn't have made much of a difference overall since the mom didn't do much other than worry), the one priests mother didn't need to be there. Scene after scene of them trying to figure out with what's wrong with her, when we as the audience already know, this isn't a mystery story so why is it trying to be. She should've been almost fully possessed and getting worked on by the two priests by like 20-30 minutes in. Than have some maybe rivalry like tension between the priest with one doing things differently from the other, that would have been way more interesting and well executed. But no she instead gets possessed almost 3/4 of the way through, up until then you feel like the movie is just wasting your time, and when she is possessed (which by the way isn't a spoiler it's the premise of the movie) there's only about 10-15 minutes of it, and it's not scary in the slightest, none of it it's just hilarious because like I said she's acting like a spoiled kid throwing a temper tantrum.

The movie got more intriguing in the second half when the priests start to get involved and the possession gets worse. I didn't find the possession scary, but I still found it interesting seeing the different types of weird stuff that was happening. It's a shame that the story wasn't as intriguing as I wanted it to be because every other aspect of the movie was pretty spot on.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Landmark film greatly weakened by the passage of time,"I won't bother to repeat what others have said about the impact of this film in its time. Some of the things that were strengths then are still strengths now. 'The Exorcist' was one of the first films of supernatural terror to feature a committed cast of first-rate professional actors and a very strong script that took its story seriously. Friedkin's direction, the relatively slow pace, and the clarity and restraint of the cinematography and almost subliminal soundtrack work as well as they ever did. For example, Friedkin makes effective use of silence and very quiet sounds instead of smothering everything in the pounding rock soundtrack that has since become the norm. The special effects, however, are primitive and largely unconvincing, and many of the most 'horrific' moments simply don't work for an audience conditioned to a far higher standard of realism. (For this viewer, thirty years on, some of the most frightening things in the film were items of Ellen Burstyn's wardrobe.)The biggest problem, however, is that 'The Exorcist' is now a victim of its original popular success and subsequent inflated critical reputation. In the thirty years since its appearance, the film has been plundered mercilessly, with the result that almost everything that made it distinctive at the time has since attained the status of cliché. By the time the film re-emerged it had inevitably lost much of its aura of originality. This accounts for some of the impatience of the younger audience with the film; the rest follows from disappointment that 'The Exorcist' simply isn't, in 2005, 'the scariest movie of all time'. If you can watch it without preconceptions, it's still a good and serious movie, and one every fan should know. Watch it back to back with 'Constantine' and ask yourself whether the old guys didn't know a thing or two.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
May the power of over-hyping compell you! May the power of over-hyping compell you!,"Channel 4 screened the Exorcist last night, after 30 years of its banning. I've seen this film before, a few weeks after it was released from its ban in 1998, and wasn't too amazed by it. But maybe I missed something. This so-called `classic' is undoubtedly the most hyped up horror in movie history. The daunting thing is, they screened the `making of' documentary two years before anybody was allowed to see the actual film.I couldn't help but chuckle at the warning before the film started: `Warning: this film is strictly for adults, and contains scenes of horror, strong violence, demonic possession, and very strong language.'The start of the film is absolutely incredible. People are digging in the sand, and discover some strange items beneath, jewellery, and small demonic statues. The imagery conjured up here is powerful and sets the mind racing of what is to come. The scene where the exorcist looks at the huge demonic statue in the blazing sun, with dogs fighting in the distance, is a beautiful piece of film. Unfortunately, the setting changes to an North American home where a mother and her delightful daughter Regan are visited by the devil via a ouija board. Regan is the victim of a rather unique `illness' which causes her to speak in different voices, have flaky skin, and enables her to turn her head 360 degrees at will.Regan is demonically possessed. What's more, she's possessed by Satan, the devil himself. Ooer! That just took the biscuit I'm afraid. Whereas I've been brought up to believe the devil is one mean mother, you would have thought he'd be capable of a bit more than squirting pea soup and screaming schoolboy obscenities. What, the devil has an Yorkshire accent? `Did you see what she did, your c***ing daughter?' Quite laughable really. Why not just a demon? Another problem with this film is the dubbing. As the devil, you would have thought his voice was a little more terrifying. When his voice comes from the girls mouth, it appears to come from all directions  did he install some speakers in the room? And what wattage were they?As a mother, she really must do more to help her child. In one scene she opens her daughters bedroom door to find the window open, gale-force winds blowing through, the room at sub-zero temperatures. Does she do the right thing and help her warm up in front of the fire to stop her freezing to death? No, she just closes the windows and pulls her blanket up. Also, what was the purpose of the demonic items that were found? Satan was supposed to have been summoned up from a ouija board, so why were they ever introduced? One of the characters finds one at the bottom of the steps, but there is no explanation as to how the evil managed to find its way into Regan.As for all the profanity in this film, coming from a non-so peaceful area myself, I hear worse `mother' jokes coming from peoples mouths every single day. I have seen more shocking things then the cunnilingus scene. Look around the Internet and you will see far more sicker things today, people who take pleasure in killing animals, torture, self-harm, mutilations, suicide. And those are REAL. Of course, I highly object to all of these things, but it certainly would have made this film more grotesque and disturbing. Animal cruelty always disturbs the audience. In Hellraiser we saw a man eating crickets, and rats being hammered to the walls by nails through their heads. This was far more shocking then any of the things I saw in the Exorcist.Bless my heart, I really did try to be scared by this film. I tried to put myself in the mothers shoes: `What if it was my daughter that did those things?' Is it just the religious types that are scared by this? Why are they offended by a four-letter word rhyming with `puck'? Why are they offended by sex? To me and you, religion is man-made and was only used by people to take care of their tribes. But the imagery of the devil in a small child was too unbelievable to be taken seriously. I want Satan to do something truly terrifying. Here he did nothing but open and close a few drawers. Yes, ever done anything that scared anyone before? Hell, during the exorcism everyone seemed fearless, as if they could take the devil lying down. But at least one person died due to the devils work, but we don't actually get to see how. We could have had the devil actually appearing and having everyone scarper. We didn't get that either.Don't get me wrong, I think this could have been THE most terrifying movie of all time. It has the atmosphere there, it builds it up, but in the end, I was left thinking `Is that it?' It really does make me laugh when I hear people talking as if the Exorcist is the best horror movie ever made. It is not. These people have not seen enough horror movies, because there are certainly more terrifying pieces of  work out there. This is strictly average viewing if you are not taken in by the hype.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Classic, timeless horror.","""Now, I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter, except in her mind. You tell me for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good. You tell me that!""Definitely one of the most well-crafted horror movies that I've seen. Lots of time is given to developing the characters and atmosphere, which leads to a pretty fantastic payoff in the end. There's a clear sense of expert care taken with every aspect of the movie; there are no slapdash efforts or cut corners, from the script to the acting to the music. This story of young girl who may be possessed by a demonic entity is full of shocking imagery, but never once feels exploitative. The themes of doubt, faith, and sacrifice are clear, but not the least bit heavy-handed. The practical special effects are still impressive today, so I can only imagine the impact they had back in 1973.Frightening, disturbing, and ultimately, even a bit uplifting. The Exorcist is one of those classic movies that's still just as good today, and that every horror buff should see.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Best for 1973 audience,"The Exorcist is always considered as a horror masterpiece. I went to watch this movie after listening so much about it. I accept that movie was made in nice manner but I may not call it best horror movie.Visuals, effects and horror are good. The characters are very strongly portrayed. Some scenes are shocking but some are really unnecessary. This movie had a problem which most of the horror movies don't have; pace and runtime. Film's pace needed to be slow and it was slow but too slow. And the runtime of 2 hr was too much, movie could have ended in 1hr 30 minutes (max).Some scenes were great and new at that time (1973) and some even became iconic. Now, you see these type of scenes in each and every horror movie.Overall, you may enjoy it but not that much maybe because we have watched alot of movies of this type. It is considered a masterpiece as it was great when we see it considering that it is 1973 movie and not 2010s.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
(2008) A Disturbing and Disgusting film (2012) One of the scariest movies of all time,"""This movie is about a 12-year-old girl who gets possessed by the devil or some kind of demon. According to critics and audiences around the globe, this is one of the scariest movies they've seen. And it's gotten a lot of attention and went through the roof at the box office. This is my opinion: It's probably one of the worst horror movies I've seen in my entire life. It wasn't even scary. It was just disturbing and disgusting. I, like the rest of my family, didn't like it that they exposed Linda Blair to all of that stuff when she was twelve years old. She didn't even know what all of that meant at the time. I'm actually trying to block this movie out of my memory entirely. It disgusts me to even thing about it. Personally, I think that they should either have taken all of that stuff out, gotten someone else, or not even made the movie at all. I mean, it's a good story and a good script, but it just didn't serve up the scares like everyone said it would. Now, don't get me wrong, the scene where she spider-walked down the stairs was pretty intense and the scenes where you see her eye turn white and her head spin around were pretty intense as well, but all in all it's just another downer. I will never see this movie again as long as I live nor will I recommend it to anyone unless they enjoy watching 12-year-old girls do horrible things that I won't even list here.""That's what I wrote in 2008. Cut to 4 years later, and I think it's one of the scariest films of all time. It messes with your head and has some of the greatest make-up and special effects ever to be captured on film. Friedkin's direction is topnotch, and you're totally convinced that Max Von Sydow is an old man. It can be argued that it's just as effective today as it was when it was released in 1973. If there was ever a movie I'd watch again for Halloween or whenever, it would be this one. Do yourself a favor and see it. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
For me The Original all time Horror movie,I recall watching this movie when I was 16yrs old and I have never watched a Horror movie since that effected me as much as this one did.I could not sleep for weeks without leaving the light on and saying my Mathew Mark Luke and John Mantra that is how scary I found it.48 yrs later and this film is as scary and shows no age!The cast was superb as was the story Linda Blair as Reagan was incredibleI think if you believe in God then you also need to accept the existence of Satan as in most things in life there exists polar opposites.It is this for me that makes it so scary a Classic film.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't pack a punch like it used to,"Writing, acting, pacing is all top notch. Everything for the time is pretty impressive, that's a big distinction though. I know this is not a popular take, but with the special fx and technology we have today, a movie like this seems like child's play in terms of horror. I respect the classics though and this film is no exception. It's not ""scary"" even a little, it's more of a drama movie and can be disturbing if you imagine yourself in some of the situations. It is directed well though, as it kept my full attention throughout. Some scenes provoke a sense of uneasiness that feels all too real, which is probably the movies strong point in terms of horror. So, I have to be honest with the rating here and say that the movie holds up just pretty well today, but will always be regarded as a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Total disappointment,"Having waited 30 years to see this film and having suffered some of the hype, my overall feeling is that this has to be one of the poorest films of all time.It is poorly characterised, there is no story, none of the performances stand out, none of the characters appear to have any great motivation the effects are weak and dated, and there wasn't one moment where I felt even remotely scared. It's not only that not a great deal happens, I could not relate to any of the characters, they were so bland, that I just didn't care about what happened.This film has no redeeming features, that I am left amazed at the reactions it has had over the years. Despite its controversial subject, the only awards that this film should have received would be ones that consigned it to permanent B-list status.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Masterpiece of a horror story,"The Exorcist has often been called the greatest horror movie ever made, and for a good reason. It was revolutionary during its release and the passage of decades has not dulled its impact in the slightest. It's still an uneasy film in the best possible meaning of the word, tapping into several sources of fear simultaneously, while still telling a coherent, captivating story. You get the creepy atmosphere right from the start as we follow an old priest in the desert and find out with him that something wrong has slipped through the cracks into the world of man. Something old and ancient, something that does not belong.But we've seen many creepy films since then and if that was all the movie had, if it was all promise and no payout, it wouldn't have earned its reputation. Luckily, the film is more rounded than that. Many ""horror"" movies nowadays rely on jump scares, easy wrights that momentarily spike our adrenaline levels without scaring the mind. It's physical, instinctive and ultimately leaves no impact. This movie and other films like it, however, do utilize shock value as a mean to create horror, but the imagery they use goes deeper than something that merely looks scary or unsettling. The sight of Regan (Linda Blair) being slowly corrupted by a demon is jarring on an emotional level. It touches the nurturing side within us. It's wrong, it's taboo and because of that it's something we will remember, something we automatically oppose. It's adult fear, to use the technical term, something quite different from being afraid of the monster under the bed.Furthermore, it's a film that shines in execution as well. All the actors do a magnificent job of portraying ordinary people that have to face the unthinkable, the impossible. The movie doesn't shy away from reality in order to make the story seem more plausible. Rather it freely acknowledges the implausibility of the situation, contradictorily making it a more believable film. Add in brilliant sound design, masterful use of music to create atmosphere, stunningly effective practical effects and great lighting and you have a film that quite effortlessly convinces you that yes, a small girl can become possessed, easily in fact.I don't think it's out of line to say you're not a true fan of horror before you've seen this film. It does so many things right and gets so little wrong that it's no wonder people still flock into theaters to see reruns of it, that people still talk about it, discuss it, lose sleep over it. Greatest horror movie of all time? Quite possibly. At the very least it's right up there at the top.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Exorcist - A personal perspective.,"I was eight years old when The Exorcist came out. The stories in the playground started almost immediately, about parents throwing up in the cinema or of ambulances being called out to distraught patrons every night. I was into horror films already thanks to Hammer and Universal. My bedroom walls were adorned with pictures and posters of Cushing, Karloff and Lee and my younger sister was too scared to ever venture into my bedroom. So, of course, I wanted to see The Exorcist desperately. I read about it at every opportunity in magazines such as World Of Horror or Monster Mag. But in those pre-video/DVD years I had to wait until I was old enough. When I was sixteen I had a friend a few years older than me, Jim. He was an adopted orphan after his parents were killed in a car crash and paraplegic, paralysed from the waist down after a pole vaulting accident when he was thirteen. He had seen The Exorcist and told me it didn't live up to the hype and was 'nothing special'. Eventually, when Exorcist 2:The Heretic came out it was being shown close to me in a double bill with The Exorcist. After much perseverance I eventually persuaded Jim to accompany me to see it. For some reason they showed Exorcist 2 first and I started to fear the worst, was this any indication of what the Exorcist was like? I needn't have worried. The Exorcist blew me away and when my friend and I emerged from the cinema, into the cold night, he eventually admitted to me that the real reason he didn't want to see it again was because it had terrified him that much that he hadn't slept for weeks. I felt guilty for dragging him to see it again. Years later we watched it again on video for old times sake. Not long after this Jim committed suicide with no warning or indication. I miss him and every time I watch The Exorcist I think of him. So apart from being one of the best films ever made it also holds a special place in my heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the greatest achievements in Cinema history,"The Exorcist is without a doubt one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. It reinforced so many ideas, and it shocked millions. But even though the film is mostly known for the 'demon girl', the film itself is a great character study. The characters are so well fleshed out, especially Father Karras. Jason Miller really gives a very subtle performance. The performances by Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair are also phenomenal. The acting as a whole is very strong. The screenplay is so fully layered out, and I was surprised. The direction and cinematography is just brilliant. The film has some incredible shots and scenes. But for those horror fans expecting full entertainment might look someplace else. This is a really moral and deep emotionally haunting film. The first half is sort of slow, but I loved all the development and progress that was done in order to get where the film was going. Overall, The Exorcist is simply one of the best horror films ever made, and perhaps the most haunting of them all. Deserves all of it's praise very much",,Anonymous,Horror
"Surprisingly dated in most areas, but still as disturbing as it was in 1973...","William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" is disturbing, scary and ultimately haunting at the same time. Viewing it now, in 2003, it seems a bit dated in some areas--but the film's gruesome depictions of possession are still as horrifying as then.Part of the fear, I think, is because it's so real. Let's face it, as scary as Norman Bates (or Freddy Krueger, for newer generations) may be, the chances of him walking into your house and repeatedly stabbing you are slim. But if you believe in any sort of religion, obviously you believe in God, Satan, demons, or some of the above. And, if you want to take it a step further, the Bible itself says demons are all around us, invisible to the eye and some, almost definitely, incarnate. Scary, huh?Stories of demons, ghosts, and so on go back thousands of years. They've always given me the creeps, mainly because the supernatural is a whole other universe. There are no human boundaries for those from the parallel universe, if you believe in such things. I come from a Christian upbringing. Whether you have religion or not, it's still disturbing--but if you do have faith it's all the more terrifying. I don't know if you do, but watching ""The Exorcist"" with faith sure will scare the bejeezes out of you.Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is a struggling actress raising her twelve-year-old daughter, Regan (Linda Blair), all by herself. Her husband has left her and refuses to speak with Regan, even on her 12th birthday. Regan has been experiencing some mild disturbances lately, ranging from her bed shaking to speaking evil and/or hurtful sentences to close friends and family.And so the realization finally hits that a demon has possessed Regan. Satan himself, supposedly, though it could just be a demon claiming to be Satan. He terrorizes the girl's body and inflicts harm. Regan turns into a beast--she has no idea what she's saying or doing. Her soul is still in the body somewhere...but the demon has completely taken control.And so an exorcism takes place, held by two priests, one of whom (Jason Miller) has recently started to lose his faith after the death of his elderly mother, and one of whom is a sort of legendary figure (Max Von Sydow). Will they be able to rid the demon from Regan's body?When ""The Exorcist"" came out in 1973, it scared everyone. Audiences held their breath. There are reports of movie-goers passing out in their seats. One man is rumored to have sued Warner Bros. because the film caused him to faint and hit his head on the edge of the seat in front of him. All this because of one horrifying film.Even stranger are the rumors of deaths on and off the set--the character of Burke Dennings, played by the famous Irish actor, died on location during filming, and so the author of the novel and script, William Peter Blatty, had to go back and make revisions. He and director William Friedkin eventually decided that the best thing to do would be killing off his character early on. It worked, and it only added a more evil overtone to the movie, and it really let the audience know that the demon wasn't just mean--it was homicidal.Other such rumors have been reported on the Steven Spielberg produced ""Poltergeist."" Many of the cast members later died in odd cases. Perhaps it's a subtle message that we're not dealing with something to be taken lightly.Luckily, no one watching the movie did. ""The Exorcist"" has dated in its past thirty years, yes, but the horrific possession scenes are still as gut-wrenchingly disturbing as they were back in '73. Hard to imagine that a film so gory and sickening was made prior to some of the teen flicks available on the market nowadays.But, if there's one thing you can credit ""The Exorcist"" for, it's that it isn't another teen slasher movie. This is an intelligent and surprisingly disturbing horror film. Some films, specifically those that are set in an unspecified year, date very well. ""The Exorcist,"" in my opinion, hasn't dated quite as well as one would hope. But the scenes that everyone remembers, the scenes that really scare people, are just as terrifying as they were thirty years ago. And so, in that sense, the film hasn't dated at all.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror that comes with conservative undertones,"""The Power of Christ compels you!"" (repeat 14 times)The scenes with the young girl possessed, spewing both vomit and horrifying profanity, still pack quite a punch, and are the highlight of this film. William Friedkin didn't hold back in imagining what the Devil would do or so say, and as contrived as the scenario is to a non-believer, it feels realistic given the assumption that it could happen. The bizarre crawling down the stairs like a spider, head spinning around 360 degrees, and general appearance of the girl (14-year-old Linda Blair) are all highly effective. I also got quite a kick out of seeing the immortal Max von Sydow as the exorcist, and the opening sequence with him leading an exaction in Northern Iraq is magnificent, albeit not all that deeply connected to what follows.Unfortunately, all this comes packaged with a deeply conservative worldview. The little girl is approaching puberty in a broken home, notably without her father present, and her mother is busy in the liberal/affluent world of being a film star. She becomes a dangerous manifestation of evil, something only the Catholic Church can save through the brave sacrifice of a couple of Fathers, one of whom needs to have his own faith re-affirmed along the way. The doctors torture the girl with all their leading-edge technology before throwing up their hands and in a highly improbable move, confess the problem may be spiritual, outside their purview. Yes, science, who needs it. In combatting the evils which have beset mankind forever, but are now omnipresent in the changing world of the 1960's and early 1970's, turn to religion, says the film - and not one of those pagan religions represented by the statue we see early on, but Catholicism. The eventual return of the girl to her childlike state, kissing another priest, is highly symbolic, and frankly quite a letdown.Aside from that, I have to say, the pacing of the film was uneven, and it lags, sometimes illogically, in getting to what we know is coming. (I mean, the girl is speaking Latin, projectile vomiting, has a gray, puffy countenance, and the priest is still wondering if she's actually possessed). It probably didn't help that I watched the Director's cut, which tacked an extra 10 minutes on to the runtime, including an odd ending sequence. It needed to go the other direction, more streamlined.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I got what i expected.,"After many, many years of knowing of this movie's existence, and pretty much knowing the plot of it, i finally decided to sit down and watch it. By all means this is a well produced movie, i think you just have to watch it when you are younger to actually get the feel of the terror.The problem is, i really never was into this kind of horror, anything paranormal never attracted me at all, same with Slashers. Now i did enjoy this movie, it was a fascinating ride watching how our main characters get through all of this. The Pazuzu jumpscare the first one did trigger me a bit i was not expecting that. I liked the movie.However, i think this movie could of been shorter, i dont think it needed to be this long. I also think that the side story of the priest was completely needless, sure the detail of his mother dying is important for the story, but when we cut to him, it just drags me out of the prime story. Now, i know this movie is a classic and all horror fans have to love it, i think the movie was fine. It's not bad as most slashers, but i didn't really enjoy it as original Child's play and Hellraiser, SAW 2 & 3 and Clockwork Orange.I just prefer movies that are more faster paced, this movie was extremely slow paced, and i got a problem with that. I have a really hard time getting into slow paced movies like this one.I can safely say that people are 100% right, that this is 100 percent better then The Conjuring and Insidious garbage that has been popping out.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
WILLIAM FRIEDKIN'S PEERLESS HORROR CLASSIC,"William Friedkin's classic history making motion picture is the greatest horror film ever made and the seminal masterpiece of its genre, his landmark film is a meticulously-mounted cinematic adaptation of William Peter Blatty's best-selling novel of the same name. About an innocent 12-year-old girl named Regan MacNeil, played by young Linda Blair in a remarkable big-screen debut which earned her an Oscar and Golden Globe Award for nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She has been possessed by a monstrous demon named Pazuzu, that causes her to change into a vile, unrecognizable being, spitting out obscenities and blasphemies as well as using telekinetic powers to hurt others. Her anguished movie star mother, Chris MacNiel, played by Ellen Burstyn in a marvelous Oscar and Golden Globe Award nominated performance for Best Actress, turns to a troubled young priest as a last resort, Father Damien Karras, superbly played by Jason Miller who delivers an intense exceptionally commanding performance which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Father Karras calls upon the Catholic church to bring in an experienced priest for an exorcism, they summon an aged exorcist/ archaeologist named Father Lancester Merrin, remarkably played by the great Swedish actor Max von Sydow in a riveting tour-de-force Golden Globe Award nominated performance. A battle ensues for the body and soul of young Regan that is one the most horrific and unforgettable finals in cinematic history. Magnificent Oscar nominated direction by Friedkin, with a compelling and intelligent Oscar winning screenplay by Blatty. Impeccable supporting performances from Lee J. Cobb, Kitty Wynn and the late Jack MacGowran, but it's von Sydow who steals this motion picture with his extraordinary performance as the Father Merrin. Oscar winner for Blatty's compelling intelligent screenplay, the chilling vocal effects are by Mercedes McCambridge, masterful makeup effects by the great Dick Smith, and astonishing Oscar nominated cinematography by Owen Roizman. One of the most frightening films of all-time which richly earned 10 Academy Awards nominations including Best Picture.NOTE: ""The Exorcist"" has been selected by the Library of Congress to the National Film Registry to be preserved for being a culturally and historically significant motion picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Try to come into possession of this great title, as a number of good things under the banner of wondrous direction come to fruition.","In The Exorcist, director William Friedkin weaves you down a tense and terrifying path of trauma; resilience; suffering; grief; the questioning of faith and, ultimately, evil. By the time the film had bedded down into this, rather literally, one on one scenario between the powers of good and evil, locked away within the confinement of a young girl's bedroom, I was worn out in all the right ways and there was still much more to come. The film fascinatingly and meticulously balances the plight of a handful of characters caught up with one another whilst on the front-line of a case involving the possession of a young girl by a demon. It details the agony and confusion at what might be wrong with her, by those close to her, right the way through to the plight of a police detective wanting to solve the cases of a handful of murders perpetrated by said spirit; all of it wonderfully well and without ever over tilting the emphasis on any one story.The film will begin in The Middle East, specifically Iraq, and an archaeologist is undergoing a large dig with dozens of locals in searching for something which is eventually found. The sense that the archaeologist has been there for a fair while, in attempting to find what it was he was looking for, is put across by way of his arriving at some ancient ruins before having some armed guards retreat upon seeing whom it actually is that has hared up to their entrance in a jeep. His time away from home and in this location suggests a great importance surrounding the item he's searching for, an importance that we feel has seen this elderly man sacrifice most of his later years in looking for it. What he finds appears to be more than a mere physical item, the apparent fever that follows his uncovering of a small fist sized trinket having him suddenly become aware of all the relatively uncanny iconography in the form of gargoyles and such when around the ancient ruins he clearly frequents often enough. If, for all that time, the said items did not all that much bother him as they tower over the general locale, then we most certainly feel something must be inherently wrong for him to be affected, scared even, by them now.Friedkin fools us into thinking this is a film about this archaeologist whom uncovered more than he thought he would in the desert. In cutting to a quaint American suburb in the town of Georgetown, Washington; the director executes his first effective gear change in tone, study and general content as the lives of an American actress in Chris MacNeil (Burstyn) and her daughter Regan (Blair) are focused on. They dwell in a large, detached house; have a healthy family relationship with one another and the domestic bliss that is this cushy American suburban existence in a really pleasant area seems too good to be true. Another major player in proceedings is young priest Damien Karras (Miller), somebody whose faith to his profession is itself under threat and whose mother is elderly and frail. The boxing trophies, his photographs and the general mise-en-scene of his small apartment in a rough neighbourhood suggests he was once a fighter, a scrapper and apparently quite good at it. A glance at his exterior surroundings and the sorts of people whom inhabit it on the career paths they are twinned with a gradual revealing of the kindhearted manner he exudes suggests a resilience through adversity; an ability to become a priest over a thief or criminal and that he may have fought a fair few battles in his time thus nicely setting things up for later duels.The inclusion of Karras is another element Friedkin introduces still without revealing a discernible pattern to proceedings nor in which the direction the film is heading. We are challenged to form a correlation between the three parties, left hanging on the fate of the early archaeologist and left questioning whose story it is. As things unravel Regan becomes ill and the doctor discerns it as an interior problem of a scientific nature which can be treated despite Regan's claims and pleas. In providing us with a 'sick' character during the opening and wonderfully establishing the extent as to which the illness affected him before cutting away without much resolution, the rendering of Regan as unwell has us wonder as to the extent it will affect her and her ability as this young girl to deal with something that it's been previously established has a powerful affect on people.In years gone by, it might have been crude to ruin what it is that forces Regan to become as ill as she does; needless to say in case you're unaware, the issue is less so a scientific one than it is one of a theological nature. As the rest of the characters are left guessing, police Lieutenant William Kinderman (Cobb) is introduced to the text, Friedkin shooting one of his exchanges with Karras beside a tennis court after previously having them get along rather nicely; the use of the court in the background and link to tennis has us think of a tennis match, specifically a one on one match of gamesmanship unfolding on top of all this other activity as Karras and Kinderman clash over the investigating of the death of a British film-maker linked to Chris. The final act sees Friedkin go for the kill, cracking on ahead with a terrifying series of scenes which work gloriously and round off a wonderful directorial job. The film, essentially a battle between good and evil, is rich in disturbing imagery without being exploitative and high drama covering a number of strands and arcs, all of which work. The Exorcist is a superb thriller, running on controversial subject matter and the brilliant direction required to hit levels of this ilk.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Well executed, but overall not that scary","Perhaps it hasn't aged as well as other films from this era. Perhaps I've just watched one too many jumpscare horror films from today. Regardless, although The Exorcist itself is disturbing and definitely a little gross, I didn't find myself that terrified or alarmed at any part of the movie. I found the ending to be anticlimactic and overall it left me with more questions that I hoped for.I will say that the portrayal of Regan is astonishingly well-acted and convincing.

Rest In Peace to the legendary special effects makeup artist, Dick Smith who created an Iconic old age look and who invented some genius techniques for execution during the shoot. There aren't too many films that are as well rounded as this one. The script, the back story, the makeup, the acting, the ambiance setting and production combined has made this an cult classic that can survive the test of time.

Intense Horror. ♦ 82%,"Classics have always been boring, if you try to watch them in this YOLO generation. But, The Exorcist is one classic horror you will not be disappointed of.It starts off with something indirect. The climax is related to the beginning. And, the story between them is entailing. Stricken by an invisible spirit, daughter of a popular actress, becomes possessed, the plot of which fails to mention why. The performance of the girl is splendid. The editing is average. And the make-up, I should say, is very genuine. You see, in horror flicks, the make-up has to be authentic and not superfluous. The Exoricst gets an 8.2/10 for this. And the music. ""Tubular Bells"" creates a bloodcurdling mood. Fantastic.It chills you; the dialogs being funny sometimes, they mostly haunt you. Although, the plot is a tad feeble, the narration quite gets a nod. Cast performance is good. Direction is good and the background murder story is the perfect correlation.BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended for horror genre lovers. This is truly a classic.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Barely horrifying or shocking,"Over the years there have been many films that are considered classics that I don't love during the first watch and appreciate it for what it is on a rewatch knowing more about those films. This is not one of those. I acknowledge the historical importance of this film and certain choices in it that made it so appealing to many throughout the years. It is due to that I think this is still an okay movie. Otherwise, most of this movie is just so blank. Reading about the different types of cultural impact it had is really surprising. It kind of shows how disturbed the Western society of that time was more than the actual quality of this film. As a few critics pointed out about why this only got an R rating, which honestly feels funny today, also resonates with me why this was such a success. It was a huge studio film and even if it was made exactly like this but independently, it could have never reached this kind of status. There were better horror films and more shocking films that could still shock people today that came out even before this film. There were definitely aspects of this film that were newer compared to those films, but still, it's not really that much of a reach compared to what has come before it.If you want to over-analyze the themes of this movie like when you do with hugely popular movies, even if they necessarily don't need it, this one is full of regressive ideas and themes. The themes it explores and the filmmaking style itself are quite laughable by today's standards.Add the director's personal approach to filming, it gets worse.It does have some positives in bringing a lot of the stuff in it more popular and spectacular ideas in the use of music. But I don't think it really came together to help it as a whole.If I want to watch a terrific horror of that time, I'd go a few years back for Rosemary's Baby or get a few years ahead to Evil Dead. For shock value of that time, I'd go for A Clockwork Orange.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
solid but not the scariest,"This is a very good movie. Its a brilliantly intense and visceral experience. Pay no attention to the lame publicity that surrounds this film. Things that try to enhance the scares. ""THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE"". This is all stupid crap designed to force feed you the idea that this is the most frightening movie of all time. Its not. It's a very good and very intense film but don't believe the hype. It will only scare you if you believe in the subject matter, if not it'll still provide a worthwhile experience. This film took guts to make. Considering the fact that this was a major studio film, it has balls. The things that happen in this film hit you like a ton of bricks. The scene with the crucifix or the scene with the statue of the virgin Mary are enough to leave almost anyone's jaw dropped in shock. The camera work is great, it leaves a lot of stuff out of frame and up to the imagination. The lighting is great because sometimes it doesn't try to obscure the scary images with shadows, it shows you the horror in natural light. It enhances the world in which this film takes place. It feels real. The acting is solid, you have some really Oscar worthy performances in a horror film. Everything comes together perfectly in this film to create a solid horror experience. It's a horror movie that feels like a character drama that feels like a horror movie...if that makes sense",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as scary as I thought it would be!,"Fifty years have passed since its first theatrical release. Perhaps It's that dated touch that restricted me from thoroughly enjoying this, or maybe it's the abundance of Horror movies that I have consumed quite rampantly over the last few years that made me desensitised to such gross stuff and turned me into an implacable nitpicker, especially when it boils down to these kinds of films.To put it simply, I did not find the movie touted as one of the scariest movies of the last century scary enough. Aside from some incredible make-up and prosthetics work and a committed act delivered by Linda Blair as twelve-year-old Regan, nothing else struck me as outstanding; I couldn't get the appeal. Do bear in mind, though, that I saw the movie for the first time. Therefore, nostalgia had no contribution in shaping my final judgement.P. S. Some dialogues were gold; the nasty things the demon says to the priest during the act of exorcism made me laugh out loud. I know I wasn't supposed to, but I could not control myself over there!Sorry, but not sorry.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Naw.  I don't like it.,"There's basically two premises at work in this movie:1) Satan is alive and well: suck on that, you 'sophisticated' yuppies; cower in fear, lapsed Catholics; know that your worst fears are confirmed, Southern Baptists.  And for no obvious reason, he might just possess your daughter!  Yes, _your_ daughter, you skeptic in the back.  Scary, eh?2) Nothing- no, nothing at all- is more utterly disturbing that seeing a young girl commit various acts of blasphemy, unless its perhaps seeing her exercise some of her bodily functions.  Satan's special effects team can even make your daughter look like her head's spinning around!  Scary, eh?Personally, I'm not buying what they're selling.  The movie's extremely well-made, especially for a horror flick, but at the very bottom of things, it's about as unsophisticated as they come.  Satan's a bit of an idiot in this one, or at least he's not given much of a character beyond taunting the protagonists (i.e., the audience- yes, YOU- by proxy).  Its main point of interest, to me anyway, is the cultural phenomenon surrounding it.  More interesting horror movies have been made, but this one seems to push the right buttons for many.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of The Scariest!,"`The Exorcist' to many movie fans is the answer to the infamous question said to poor Sydney in the `Scream' trilogy = `What's your favorite scary movie?' `The Exorcist' did scare me. However, it did not possess me enough to declare it the scariest movie of all time. I give that honor to `The Amytiville Horror.' For those of you who do not know, this horror flick is about a pre-adolescent who inhabits a bit of a behavioral problem. I loved the theme song of the film `You Spin Me Round' by Dead or Alive. Ok! I will quit exorcising I mean exercising my sarcasm.  This new version, which includes some old deleted scenes from the original, will also make you sleep with the light on. Linda Blair's haunting performance is one of the best of all time by a child actress. What could have possessed her to take crappy roles afterwards?

scariest movie of the 1970's,"The first time iv'e seen the exorcist it scared me so bad i had nightmares for days,and that was in the mid 80's,during its re-release its a modern horror film depicting the possession of an average good natured 12 year old(Linda Blair)but when demons begin to possess her all chaos breaks loose,this was done before cg effects came out.the movie seemed cursed,a few people died during filming like jack McGowan and some crew members.in the new version with the added scenes there's a lot of footage not shown in the 1973 release.the cast is great,Linda Blair delivers an awesome performance as Reagan,the little girl possessed.max Von sydow as father merrin,Ellen burnsyn as Reagan's actress mother, Jason miller as the troubled catholic priest.and lee j Cobb as the inspector on the case.no movie ever topped or even matched this,many movies like;beyond the door,abbey,and the tempter all tried but failed.the sequels never lived up to the original.fact Linda Blair injured her back during filming.the spooky music on the soundtrack is very memorable,the exorcist is the scariest movie from the 70's. it needs to be viewed in its uncensored version to be appreciated. there's a lot of strong language and violence.max Von sydow,Linda Blair and kitty Wynn reprised their roles in the first sequel called the heretic exorcist 2,which was pointless,the third one was OK,the latest one was a prequel and was'nt good in my opinion.the exorcist is a horror movie one does'nt forget,a true classic.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing horror film that easily stands up today,"This is an exceptionally made movie. I got to see it theaters too, which only made it better. The film might be a tad slow in the beginning, but it picks up quickly once Reagan gets possessed and starts doing weird things. During the scenes where Reagan is flipping out, the special effects are incredible, especially for the time. They'll have things flying across the room, the entire bed shaking furiously, and of course, the projectile vomit. All of those look extremely realistic and they add to the super creepy atmosphere this film has. The voice they gave the possessed Reagan is perfect. If I had to choose a voice for the devil, it would have been that one. It really gets to you and makes every scene that has it way more frightening. The movie does have issues though. In the very beginning, they have this backstory about this little sculpture of the devil being found and I found it to be both unnecessary and kind of confusing. It isn't really clear if the devil got released because of that statue or what. I couldn't find a correlation between that statue and Regan either. Only other problem I have is the devil being very picky about how he uses his power. I don't understand why he just didn't break the straps and leave. I know they tried to explain it, but it doesn't really make any sense. Damien Karrass asked him that and he responded with ""that would be a display of too much power"" or something like that. He says that, yet he'll throw stuff all over the place and throw up on people, and even kill people. How is breaking some straps too much power? I call bs on that explanation. Other than those 2 problems, fantastic horror movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Reissue of a classic,"The 2000 reissue of this film adds a number of scenes that really don't do much for the story. In fact, they slow things down, making it clear why they weren't in the original version.The story holds up well, and the confrontation between Max Von Sydow and the demon are especially good. Von Sydow has played Jesus in THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD and Satan in NEEDFUL THINGS. Here his portrait of an aging but determined priest is strong and is essential to the believability of the final act which seems to indicate that the devil and the priest have an old score to settle.The effects are good although somewhat tame by modern standards, yet it was this film that led the way for the more vivid horror films that followed.",,Anonymous,Horror

Watchable enough and kind of funny.,I didn't dislike this but it's a fairly nondescript little drama and indeed I would call it a dark supernatural drama over a horror.You can't be that scary with an expert on hand to explain it all to you. That's partly why the Conjuring doesn't work.I do enjoy watching the little girl gradually become more and more demoniacal with its neat effects and visual gags but a cute little girl insisting that your mother performs fellatio in a truckers voice is not scary.

Incredible movie,"Still one of my favourite horror films. Amazing story, amazing acting, incredible effects. Easy 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting & compelling for its time,"One of the films that nobody can believe I hadn't seen until recently is 'The Exorcist', William Friedkin's screen adaptation of William Peter Blatty's novel. Starring a young (and pretty weird looking) Linda Blair as Regan, the unfortunate 12 year old who Satan decides to possess, Ellen Burstyn as her mother and Max von Sydow and Jason Miller as the priests who attempt to exorcise Regan's demons, the film has been called 'The Scariest Film of All Time'.I think that in 1973 it probably WAS the scariest film of all time. Unfortunately, as with so many films that hold any substantial amount of notoriety, the film has been so pervasive in pop culture that nothing is up for grabs as a surprise anymore for anyone who genuinely hasn't seen it. We know about the 360 degree head turn, the pea soup, the vulgarities spewed from the mouth of this little girl with a Mercedes McCambridge voice (probably one of the most frightening aspects of the film). What I was prepared to base my opinion on was the actual film. How did the film progress from one shocking scene to another? Unfortunately, I found that it is pretty weak. Friedkin's jump-cut scenes are almost as startling as anything else in the film. There are many things that go unexplained, or are at least barely weakly supported, (for example, why Regan ended up in the hospital going through testing in the first place; all she had said at that point that she had felt her bed shake) and plots that are built up go nowhere. (I'm still confused as to what the excavation in Iraq had to do at all with the end results) The acting is decent in The Exorcist; Burstyn is always good, and Blair is good enough to see that she was probably completely miserable for the duration of the filming.The version I saw was fortunately the director's cut, which featured the very effective 'spider walk' scene that Friedkin had removed for thirty years, and some really great flashes of what I kept calling the 'zombie face', which turned out to be extremely effective in terms of scare value. Every time there would be one of these 'subliminal' shots, you could hear people in the audience ask one another 'Whoa! Did you catch that?' The print was also stellar, which allowed us to see Friedkin's excellent lighting in this film.I caught the midnight showing at a locally owned theater on the eve of Halloween, and the crowds 'The Exorcist' drew is a testimony to its long-standing reputation and its inherent appeal, even thirty years later. While the film itself is just okay, and the actual 'horror' portions are almost passé in this day and age, the film should certainly be remembered for its impact thirty years ago, and in reality, because 'The Exorcist' raised the bar for horror films, the eventual emulation by future directors of horror films probably caused its own impact to be lessened. I also believe that once the dust cleared on the shock value, it is clear to see that the rest of the film is not as strong as it maybe should be. Still, the film is an important one, even with its shortcomings. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is a JOKE,"Yes, I had never seen this movie before!! Until yesterday...

It's obviously hitting some Freudian buttons for everybody. One reviewer suggested that the movie was really about the rape of Regan by the demon, the medical community etc. Certainly the sexual vibe is there, but I think that's just one facet of it. In addition, it hits people by exposing the actual immense ignorance of the medical community to how our bodies function and what they know about it. I would think that many people who have gone through any kind of serious illness will relate to the moment the doctors just shrug and throw up their hands. Its hard to argue with anybody who also suggests that it's an extreme example of the mood swings of puberty. I also think that the Exorcist manipulates our innate ambivalence about reality, religion, superstition, human existence and fear.

True, I am not really a fan of horror to begin with, but I've seen my fair share of horror films from IT to The Ring, and even Shutter. Still, The Exorcist felt very mild. I much expected it to be one to leave a deep impression in my mind but nope. While some may say that the limited use of jumpscares is what made it amazing (as jumpscares is 'cheap' horror), I more simply saw it as a horror film not doing what it is meant to do aka make you freak out, scream and the such.

"Good effects, mood, and general acting.","I hate horror films. I don't generally get scared that easily, and true enough I did not think The Exorcist was scary while watching it, but when you're alone at night in the dark trying to sleep, it's a whole different story. I had to sleep with a light on the first night after watching this, because all I think about when I try not to think about it is the film and the ugly demon's face and whatnot. Even now I'm dreading writing this review. But putting the horror aside, this film was very well made.The acting once I think about it, is actually really good. Ellen Burstyn as the mother has really great expressions and her reactions are on point. I'm not actually sure how Linda Blair as Regan acted as the demon, but if that was her then she did a really good job too. (I try not to stare at them ugly horror faces, but the expressions and actions did seem demonic) Karras was another main character in this and he played the part of a distraught son and priest really well, torn between his duty and the loss of someone he loved.The effects is also very good for its time. Made in the 70's, the shaking of the bed to the make-up and telekinesis of objects seemed pretty real. Except for the vomit which just looked like green goo from Nickelodeon.The mood of the whole film was also very well established with the beginning scene in Iraq/Israel? It laid the foundation for something ancient and kind of supernatural to come into the film. Also, Regan's room is constantly cold and getting colder, I read somewhere that there was actually a layer of frost in the room due to them filming in real conditions.And of course, let's talk about gender. The daughter has to be the one invaded because 'girls' are vulnerable and open to penetration, and to being invaded. The demon entering her body is, if you think about it, kind of like rape. And the mother is a single parent who can't do anything, and needs the help of men to save her daughter and her family.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

But...I frankly hate it.""But it's a classic."" you might say. Yes, it is. But just because it's old, or widely praised, doesn't mean it's good. In fact, classic is a very loose term, and just because it's considered one, doesn't mean I am obligated to enjoy something I don't like. Maybe it was scary at the time, but the horror doesn't hold up. And it's not because it's old. Older films like ""The Man Who Laughs"" (1928) or ""Psycho"" (1960) are amazing films still scare, and some of the best to come out horror.Now, what are my issues? Well, for one thing, it's not scary, and a lot of it is actually funny. I'm sorry, vomit and piss is not scary. And is also way too long, focussing on uninteresting subplots and dull characters. Also, scenes like the scene where the possessed girl mutilated herself is not frightening, way too over the top, and even a little offensive. And it tries way too hard to make the audience feel something with unnesary amounts of gore that just disgusts the audience.Now, is there anything I like? Well, yes.

Terrific horror,"I have no idea why this is considered by some to be the scariest movie of all time. That is truly baffling. But it is a very good film and decently scary.Is it a tad too long? Probably. Are there a few too many superfluous elements in the story? Most definitely. But aside from these issues the film is really well executed.It feels creepy and engaging and has some brilliant performances in it. Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair are both spectacular which really sets this film up.Despite it feeling too long, the story is still really compelling with a great energy and tone to it.Even though it's hard to see why people consider this film to be really scary, it's not hard to see why people consider it to be a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good...But Dated By Today's Standards,"The Exorcist was the first film about demonic possession that was a huge hit late in 1973. The hype was amazing. They had theater managers dressed up as paramedics to promote the film because there were reports that people were fainting, vomiting, and getting all kinds of other sick symptoms when they saw this movie.The premise was good for it's time. Demonic possession in a pre-teen girl, parent doesn't know what to do, doctors run all the physical tests, including blood-work, and MRI's, everything is normal so.....AHHH HA!, the girl's possessed! We get the dramatic effects of head-spinning, vomiting, bed-levitation, and ""F*** Y**!"" bombs enough to nauseate ourselves (at least in the uncut version.) Young Linda Blair certainly makes a good devil child. But the problem is that all of the adults in the movie, ranging from her Mother, to the doctors, to the clergy, serve as little more than reactionary figures to what Reagan does, or simply say, ""We don't know what the problem is."" So when the exorcism is finally performed, you KNOW that Reagan's gonna have a hissy-fit tantrum, scream profanities, and throw up.The beginning of the film goes on forever and is downright boring. It is almost as if the writers needed to add some subplots because obviously you can't have 2hrs of ""What do we do about poor Reagan's fits?"" A great music score is a plus and you might get some scares and gross outs ONCE the first time you see it. If this was 1973 and I was writing this review than, I would give the film a higher rating because for that time, this was cutting-edge horror. But now, there are SO many films that can do the ""satanic child"" story with even stronger supporting characters where you don't have to wait for 45 minutes for something to happen. (i.e The Omen.) The Exorcist has some good shock moments, but the story is too predictable, and the other characters are too one-dimensional to make it a great film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An absolute classic, one everyone can and should remember","The Exorcist, a film more than forty years old, still holds up today as one of the definite greatest horror masterpieces ever. It left audiences shaking and in cold sweats, never sure what was coming next. The special effects are still superb, blending reality into fiction with the dedicated craftsmanship of the production team. The dialogue is absolutely bone-chilling, especially when such despicable words are uttered out of a girl's mouth in a demon's raspy voice. And something that may fall by the wayside in a viewer's conscious mind but absolutely was a key component in making the movie great was the cinematography; shots of chilling streets and spinning heads. The Exorcist is a movie any film buff should see and an absolute delight for any horror fan.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the worst movies of all time.,"A weak story that relies heavily on special effects and shock to hold the viewers' attention. For a film to be regarded as 'great' it needs: i) a story that gives us depth of character, ii) strong motivation for the lead character/s iii) themes that lie at the heart of the viewers' values iv) film techniques that draw us in to the story v) believability within the context of the film's story The Exorcist has none of these elements. It has achieved its fame through manufactured controversy (often thanks to religious zealots) and the use of 'horror' just for the sake of it rather than for a purpose. For examples of horror that works consider The Cabinet of Dr, Caligari, the original Frankenstein and Dracula, Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby, all of which draw the viewer into caring about the characters, empathising with them, questioning the antagonist's motives, allowing us to enter the world of the film rather than stopping us at the screen by reminding us of the filmic process through special effects and inappropriate spectacular visuals. Even the low budget, simple Blair Witch Project provides horror through enabling us to imagine being in a similar situation. Even the comedic Scream provides some occasions of horror through scenarios we can briefly relate to. But The Exorcist? No, it provides none of this. It's a third rate, unpleasant, unimaginative film lacking any subtlety and ends up abusing the medium of film. Tao902.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Greatest Horror Movie of all Time,"The first time I watched this movie a couple of years ago I had to turn it off because I crapped my pants, but now i've watched it I can now admire it but at the same time fear it.

Let's face it a lot of great movies came out in the 70s and the effects weren't as good as they are today, but they some how amazingly the effects were fantastic and one of the highlights of the movie.It has been called the scariest movie of all time and to be honest I can see why because I don't scare easily.

Genre defining,"This is still an excellent film. It is really engaging, scary and fascinating. I'll start with my complaints. The cinematography does look a little dated, mostly with the slow camera zooms but nothing too off-putting. A bigger issue is the dialogue, it sounds like it was dubbed from inside a toilet. It doesn't sound remotely like it should and this is a shame as occasionally I found it very distracting. In the extended version, possibly the original too, I also felt that they took Regan to the doctors without enough motivation, she hadn't seemed that ill at that point to warrant such invasive investigation into what was wrong with her. And that is it with the negatives. The film is incredibly well made. I cannot get across how perfect the story and the characters are developed culminating in such a terrifying final act. The way that the characters are established completely justifies how they behave throughout the film. Normally I don't like films with actors or directors as the main protagonist but in this case it actually makes sense for the story and the reactions. The pacing is excellent, even with the lengthy build-up to the actual exorcism and the length of the exorcism you don't get bored and become fully immersed into the lives of the people in the story. Quite incredible really, they defined a genre and no-one has been able to improve on it. This really is a horror film that all fans of the genre should watch.

It's not just organizing jumble sales,"I remember all the hype when this film came out, how it was the most gruesome film of all time, people fainting and becoming possessed in theatres etc., but I was too young to see it then. I finally caught up with it a few years later at the mature old age of 19, and loved all the profanity, head spinning and puking, as you do at that age. Then two or three years ago I read Blatty's original book, and last year saw the film for the second time, and found as I enter early middle age I have quite a different perspective. It is not a sensationalist horror film at all, but a rather intelligent exploration of the nature of good and evil (apparently loosely based on a real case, the priests involved were staying on campus when Blatty was a college student in 1947). In a way it resembles nothing so much as an extended recruitment for the Catholic priesthood. Perhaps its tagline should be ""It's not just organizing jumble sales ... you too may get to go one on one with Satan himself!""",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I know that when people saw the opening day release they left shocked and horrified like in a daze or trance. I also know for a fact that people actually threw up in the theaters which I have never heard happen with any other movie. Max Von Syndow has done many many good film presentations and this may be his most famous. Lee J. Cobb is also well cast and so was the other father even though I have not seen him in anything else to date.

"The Exorcist: It's Fine, But Far From Brilliant","Regularly labelled as the scariest film of all time, and considered by many to be the best, the infamous stories surrounding the release of The Exorcist and the reactions of its audiences ensure an impressive reputation precedes the viewing of this classic.Concerning 12 year old Regan MacNeil, the film details her possession at the hands of the demon Pazuzu. After the subsequent psychiatric and medical treatments prove useless, her mother arranges an exorcism, hiring two priests to drive the demon from her daughter's body.With such a reputation, I was either going to be disappointed, or discover a film I would love. Sadly, the former was the case. Good performances compliment the film, an interesting concept and storyline give it a solid foundation, but it just turned out to be overrated. It features an interesting and compelling theme, and one I see most effectively in the character of Father Karras. His was the plot line I was most interested in, and one which I feel was particularly well developed, Jason Miller giving a wonderfully stoic depth of emotion to his character. In the end, I certainly enjoyed the film, but it was nothing to the reputation it enjoys. Certain scenes seemed rather unnecessarily violent and inappropriate and included simply for the shock value, detracting from the film's effect and making me question its true intentions. It may be the case that the film has not aged particularly well, and I do wish I had seen it on its initial release, but as I did see it, it did little for me beyond a standard quantity of entertainment.The Exorcist supports itself for its running time, its thematic shadow lingering throughout. Father Karras is the film's best facet, but he's not enough in himself, leaving the film somewhat unbalanced. In short, it's fine, but far from brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I Couldn`t Stop Laughing,"I remember when THE EXORCIST was first released in Britain , I was 7 years old at the time and living in Edinburgh and a neighbour called Ann Lyon was just back from the cinema telling my parents how the movie lived up to the hype and what a truly shocking , gut wrenching experience THE EXORCIST was . My parents went to see it a few days later ( In 1973 this was the ONLY movie people were talking about ) and their verdict was that it was a bloody stupid film unworthy of all the fuss . I don`t know if that prejudiced my view in later life but I also found THE EXORCIST a bloody stupid film unworthy of the hype , but I will give it credit where it`s due - It`s also an extremely funny film tooI congratulate everyone for this classic comedy , the tears of laughter ran down my cheeks watching it . A young girl called Regan is possessed by a demonic force that causes her skin to turn blue , turn her head 360 degrees , float in mid air , speak in a booming voice and spit out large amounts of chocolate fudge . I bet David Blaine is cursing his luck about being overlooked by Satan . This is funny enough but it`s the words coming out of Regan`s mouth that caused me to split my sides , you`ll understand that I`m paraphrasing here "" Go stick your toffee apple up his bottom you naughty priest "" and "" Your mother sucks toffee apples in hell "" Be honest girls , does that second qoute seem like a fate worse than death ?I do concede that this is a well made movie but this only adds to the unintentional laughs as the cast give genuinely shocked expressions as the profanity keeps spilling out of the mouth of young Regan . This is what I describe as "" THE EXORCIST factor "" ie the more the cast and crew try and convince the audience that all this is sickeningly horrible the more laughably ludicrous it all becomes . That`s why horror spoofs like REPOSSESSED an SCARY MOVIE 2 fail to out do THE EXORCIST as a comedyAs a footnote I mentioned that many people in Edinburgh saw this at their local  cinemas as did a great many people in British cities in 1973 , but one exception was Glasgow where the local council banned the film from cinema chains in the city . Other films Glasgow city council have banned since then include THE LIFE OF BRIAN and ROMPER STOMPER",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Audience Reaction Helps,"It's said that one thing which enhanced Hitchcock's now famed 10:00 a.m. ""Psycho"" premiere in New York was the extreme audience reaction of shock.Like viewers' laughter for comedy, horror films often depend upon audience screams, gasps and general ""anxiety vibes"" which sweep through the house.Certainly such was the case for ""The Exorcist"" when it first made its showings back in '73. It's impossible to re-create that reaction today and part of the film's initial success was how effective Friedkin (like Hitchcock) was able to manipulate his audience.It's constantly intriguing how each audience tends to take on a personality of its own (watch a film several times in a theater and note how variable and distinctive the reaction becomes from each group.Thus, when one sits alone today to watch a DVD, it's a world of difference from those initial screenings of ""The Exorcist"" in the 70s, when folks were experiencing it for the first time.Friedkin's film has held up pretty well, thanks to his painstaking production values.  But true impact of ""The Exorcist"" is forever part of filmgoers' past history.A hard-working cast was apparently pushed to the breaking point to finish this production, which ran way overtime.  Like many tortuous film shoots, the extra effort has paid off, making ""The Exorcist"" one of the top films in the horror genre.",,Anonymous,Horror

"""What an excellent day for an exorcism.""","This is to me one of the scariest films of all time. Before movies about the devil or demons was commonplace or before it may have become comical through imitations and parodies. It all may depend though on whether you believe in God or pure evil.It is the story of a twelve year old girl named Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) who becomes possessed and her mother Chris' (Ellen Burstyn) fight to get her well. After seeing multiple doctors who are unable to get her daughter better she meets with Father Karras (Jason Miller) who is a psychiatrist. He meets Regan and through his investigation gets Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) who has experience with exorcisms in driving the demon away.Personally, I think everyone puts in an A+ performance from Burstyn's excellent portrayal as Chris MacNeil to Linda Blair who in the roles I have seen her in never did a better job. I love how when her character is introduced she is in fact asleep. To Jason Miller who I thought hit it out of the ballpark in his role. Max von Sydow is great and memorable as the old-timer priest even though he was in his early 40s. Great what makeup and acting can do. Lee J. Cobb showed his incredible range playing a caring, smart cop and not a grimy villainous character that he generally played.Directed by William Friedkin who at one time really did make amazing films and was one of the best current (at the time) filmmakers around. He uses the same approach he used in THE FRENCH CONNECTION in trying to make it as realistic as possible even though to some the subject matter may be way out there. Written by William Peter Blatty who grabbed an Oscar and was based on his own novel. The film also has a terrific score which the title theme by Mike Oldfield, which is interesting because it was not written for the film. Rather Friedkin was looking for music and came across Oldfield's newly released record and thought the song would work for his film.I have seen this one in a movie theatre and loved it! Personally this is one of the greatest horror films ever made and to me a 9/10 rating doesn't quite do it justice, but there are a few things in the film that drop the rating a bit as it is not a perfect film. The one scene that perhaps many people love, but to me makes me laugh is the spider-walk when Regan comes down the stairs and blood is coming out of her mouth. I do not find it scary and to me it seems to be comical and sort of way out of left field.Anyways, I know after watching this I ain't gonna be buying my kid a Ouija board so that can talk to Captain Howdy! I could go on forever about how great this film is, but you should just watch it instead. Followed by a number of lesser sequels including EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC and it is incredible how bad that one is.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Meaning: Is this really the *scariest film ever*? And the answer must be ""it depends"". Because if you do not believe in what this depicts, and even worse, if you take this completely out of its chronological context(translation: If you don't consider that this was made in the early 70's, since some norms have changed since then), frankly, several of the things can inspire laughter rather than fear(!). And with that said... this is quite well-made, and for such a potentially sensationalistic subject, it respects cinematic language and contains proper, gradual build-up, as any well-told story does. The acting is great, including Blair's performance. Plot develops nicely throughout. The characters are credible and consistent. A scene or two just... stop, ending at an exciting time instead of resolving the conflict. The direction is effective, and Friedkin does what he can to terrify us, and no matter if you think it's real or not, most of it is unsettling, to say the least. Also, there is no doubt that this inspired later horror movies. There is a lot of strong and outright explicit language, as well as bloody violence and disturbing content in this.

In addition, it was the first horror film in history to be nominated for an Oscar, already racking up 10 nominations, including best picture!This movie has so many hits, it's hard to say which one is the greatest. But, if I were to take the risk, I would say that the biggest hit is in the direction, which is precise and millimeter! There were several difficulties in filming and even so, the film came out flawless! In addition, the practical effects throughout the film demean the current horror movies, very realistic and scary at the same time.The film's script is a separate art, having four extremely interesting narrative lines that, throughout the plot, are interconnected and the story grows more and more. Concluding this question, the film has that tension and gradual terror, little by little more and more distressing! Added to the subtle but emblematic soundtrack, everything is impeccable.Adding up all the positives, and none of the negatives hahah! The movie literally consolidates itself as the biggest and best horror movie, easily one of the best movies, of any genre, of all time. Simply a masterpiece of the genre, incorrigible! I absolutely love it, one of my all-time favorites!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Exorcist: Does It Still Scare, or Is Nostalgia at Play?","As a dedicated horror enthusiast, I often revisit films to uncover subtle nuances and hidden details, exploring horror cinema from around the world. I'm a generous rater, frequently awarding 9s or 10s to films I enjoy.Regarding The Exorcist, I understand its R rating, given the presence of adult content that is more shocking and vulgar than genuinely frightening. While it may have been groundbreaking upon its release in 1973, the film does not evoke fear for contemporary audiences. Those who might find it scary are likely either nostalgic fans or individuals less acquainted with the horror genre.The narrative lacks coherence; specifically, the mechanism of the demon's possession of the young girl is unclear. None of the scenes elicited fear, perhaps due to my extensive exposure to horror content. Even when I screened the film for my younger cousins in a dark setting with optimal audiovisual conditions, their reactions were indifferent. It's challenging to imagine someone being frightened by this film unless they are nostalgic, a dedicated fan, or an infrequent horror viewer.Not so scary, not a great, mysterious and captivating story (try watching The Wailing(2016) to get what I am saying), and a lot of illogical stuff. I won't recommend this movie to a new generation.Considering its impact at the time of release, I would rate it a 7 out of 10. However, if it were released in 2024(when I watched it for the first time), even with enhanced graphics, I would rate it no higher than a 3 or 4.I am sure I am inviting a lot of dislikes with this from this movie's fans around the globe.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
STILL one of the best possession movies ever made.,"I'm not familiar with mainstream possession movies prior to William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' in 1973. Back then, this surely must have been controversial, and frightening - especially since the possessed is a 12-year old girl.The film starts off very ordinary, with daily activities and events we can all relate to, and everyday dialogue. This, off course, is in sharp contrast to what was to come - and very effective.A lot of the things that 'happened' to the girl, was off screen and merely talked about. This is a most unusual approach for this type of film. The actual moment of possession is not even shown. Maybe this way it is more realistic and gives the viewer something to think about. After all, the girl, Regan, was shown playing with a Ouija board earlier in the movie, and we can only assume this to be the cause of her becoming possessed.The sight of the possessed Regan is truly a frightening sight and must have given many people nightmares back in 1973. It is disturbing even today. 'The Exorcist' is still by far one of the best and most effective possession movies ever made.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What on earth was all the fuss about?,"Now I know that I first saw this film in November 1998. But going of the old cliché 'once a good movie always a good movie' I expected something amazing.What I got was dated and, I have to say, boring film. The scenes of gore that were supposed to send people home, with visions that would haunt them forever were no longer significant as today's TV made them look less sickening than an episode of the Simpsons' sub-series Itchy and Scratchy.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
THEE Classic Modern Horror Movie,"""The Exorcist"" is a film that goes full-circle from modern Twentieth Century medicine to the church exorcism of the middle ages, all within the two hours that it's on the screen. The movie revolves around three characters in it: Father Merrin, Max Von Sydow, Father Karras, Jason Miller, and Regan MacNeil, Linda Blair.Father Merrin unsuspectingly releases the devil from an ancient archaeological dig that he's in charge of in northern Iraq which ends up possessing little Regan MacNeil in Georgetown USA. Father Karras is the priest who suggested that an exorcism was warranted after examining Regan, with Karras being a trained psychiatrist, and seeing that she's beyond all known psychiatric and medical help.Father Merrin seems guilt-stricken in the beginning of the movie when he realized that he released a demonic spirit into the world by unearthing it from the ruins of his expedition. When he's contacted by the church later in the movie to preform an exorcism Father Marrin sees his chance to correct what he unwitting did by driving the evil spirit out of little Regan's body that he feels that he was responsible for.Father Karras, who is losing his faith in his religion, who's also guilt-ridden over his mothers death sees in saving Regan from her demonic possession, which he became convinced of after examining her, as a restoration of his faith. Karras also feels that the exorcism will make up for him not being more attentive to his mother who died and wasn't found in her NYC apartment until days later. Regan MacNeil, who by being the innocent victim of demonic possession, brought both priests together in a common case to exorcise the devil out of her body and in that way redeem themselves of their guilty consciences. The final half hour of the film ""The Exorcist"" is one of the most memorable as well as heart stopping chapters in movie history. Both Fathers Merrin and Karras heroically succeed is casting the devil out of Regan but at a frightful price to themselves.""The Exorcist"" is truly one of the greatest horror movies of all time even with some awful drawbacks. The dubbing of Regan's voice as that of the devil comes across like the very bad dubbing of English dialog in a Japanese monster movie. Regan's head-turning scenes in the movie are more comical then scary. The ending of the movie leaves you up in the air to who won the battle, in Regans bedroom, between good and evil?the priest or the devil?. Still if imitation is a form of success then ""The Exorcist"" which had hundreds of imitators over the last thirty years is undeniably one of the great, as well as influential, films of all times.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Greatest epic horror ever, until now even","Greatest epic horror ever, until now even . I have watched this movie over 15 times since when it came out in 73.

The special effects, makeup and costumes are 10x better than any Netflix movie now. The story and special effects were beyond their time. I remember when this came out people were screaming in the cinemas and many had nightmares after. This is one of those movies that everytime you watch it you discover more details you missed.

Will Always Be A Classic,"This is one of the OG horror out there. I remember how much everyone would talk about this movie and how scary and horrible it is. For back in the day I suppose I understand why.This film dared to show a child being possessed, her cursing and swearing, talks of sexual acts and showing one at that.I've finally had the chance to watch this when I was 15. I felt kind of uneasy watching it but it also had moments where I felt that it was dragging on. The ending I didn't find to be satisfying, wasn't a fan of it.Something that really stood out to me was the infamous theme song 'Tubular Bells' which to this day is one of my favourites and I learned to play it on piano.This movie has definitely aged and calling it scariest movie of all time I won't however I do praise its daredevil nature with how brute the film was and how much the film made at the box office for a horror movie back then.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Girl possessed, priest obsessed, head spun.","William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" is a groundbreaking horror film that showcases the technical mastery of its director and crew. From the expertly crafted sound design to the innovative use of camera angles and framing, every aspect of this film is a testament to the power of the horror genre to shock, terrify, and captivate audiences.Friedkin's use of long takes, particularly during the climactic exorcism scene, heightens the tension and sense of dread, allowing the viewer to fully immerse themselves in the horror unfolding before them. The use of practical effects, including the makeup and prosthetics used to transform Linda Blair's appearance, adds to the realism of the film, making it all the more terrifying.The sound design is equally impressive, with every creak, groan, and demonic voice contributing to the unsettling atmosphere. The iconic score by Mike Oldfield perfectly captures the mood of the film, using a mix of classical and electronic instruments to create a haunting and unforgettable soundscape.The performances by the cast are exceptional, with Ellen Burstyn delivering a standout performance as the mother struggling to save her daughter from the clutches of evil. Max von Sydow's portrayal of Father Merrin is equally impressive, conveying both the wisdom and weariness of a man who has battled evil his entire life.Overall, ""The Exorcist"" is a horror masterpiece that remains a timeless classic to this day. With its technical brilliance, outstanding performances, and uncompromising vision, this film is a must-see for any cinephile interested in the power and potential of horror cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Its good,"Its just good, thats about it, I dont agree that its the ""Scariest"" movie of all time. Sure maybe back in 1973, it was scary but this is 2000-times r changing & this movie should stay in the 70's where it belongs. I've seen many horror films that r scarier than this. I'm not saying its bad, it is disturbin but I just think that it should stay where it belongs, in the 70's. Just like Freddy, Michael, & Jason should stay in the 80's.If u want 2 see a much scarier movie, I suggest u see: 1. The Thing - 1982 version 2. Demon Knight 3. The Shining - 1980 version 4.

A great classic horror,This is one of the best horror films ever made it was so ahead of its time for special effects acting and just pure horror factor.

She starts acting stranger and stranger so her mother takes her into a doctor to see if anything is wrong.

It Makes Beetlejuice Laugh,"I was only 9 when The Exorcist was released in December of '73 but I was aware of its existence from a magazine titled Famous Monster of Filmland which had a cover which featured a vivid illustration of Linda Blair in full demonic possession. As a kid who devoured anything horror related I was certainly intrigued by this and the accompanying article within. I wouldn't be until a good ten years later before I would have the opportunity to actually see the film. I had read the novel previously (probably the worst novels I have ever read) so I was not going in totally blind.It was enjoyable but hardly lived up to the hype of being the ""scariest film ever made"" . The title has become as hyperbolic as ""the worst film ever made"" and is purely subjective. It is a very well made film but I doubt that a modern audience will understand what the fuss was about that caused individuals to flee the theatre and into the lobby or, sonetimes, the nearest church. It's amusing to watch a compilation of reactions of those who were so traumatised by the film, oftentimes find it difficult to find words to describe the experience. A modern audience might be very bored. The film is a slow burn and it doesn't get ""scary"" until the final act and the actual exorcism. It does build a creepy mood and establishes its characters. Little creepy moments are peppered throughout and gives the audience the awareness of a demonic presence and a battle brewing between it and the priests, dark and light locked in mortal combat inside a little girl's room.I never found it particularly scary. I admire it more for the technical aspects,especially the amazing make up effects by the legendary Dick Smith. Being the days long before CGI all of these effects needed to be down on set. From the levitation of the bed to the spewing of vomit they fell to the various technicians to make them happen and look convincing. It was only until recently that they restored the infamous ""spiders walk"". I think it looks silly and is more comical than froghtening. I understand why the film is a classic of the horror genre but I wonder if it really requires its viewer to have some belief in the idea of demonic possession to e effected by the film. In some cultures tne devil is a trickster and does not correspond with a Christian devil that has a more malevolent purpose.The cast is outstanding, even the real priests who were not trained actors. Had the cast been all unknown actors it might have been more effective. Director William Friedkin keeps the supernatural elements of the story subtle and subdued until that final act, and then hits the audience full force. I cannot imagine how the '73 audience might have reacted to all this. One must keep in context that a mainstream audience had not seen anything like this before. There have been gory horror films but in the low budget, exploitation level. This was something new. Nowadays we are almost immune to the gore and horror that might make The Exorcist quaint in comparison. It will still disturb some. I think the suggestion of a demonic force inhabiting a young girl is enough to freak out some people and keep them from seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not Scary But Shocking,"24 January 2010. Thirty-seven years later, the sharp, vivid, fine resolution of the initial Iraqi scenes brings this aging but classic movie into the contemporary age with shots so visceral of great film-making that rivals the quality of even today's advances in film work. As time passes and the scary horror films keep piling up, most of the once classic shots from turning of heads and spitting of goo have transformed this horror movie into predictability, yet the shock value remains mostly because of how utterly graphic and degrading the dialogue and the devilish behavioral occurs in this movie, particularly in the middle portions of the movie. The judicial use of horror and strange where only about five brief odd occurrences are revealed in the first half-hour reveals how focused this movie is on the careful editing and balance of horror and drama and relational interactions that pervade this film. Perhaps only the color and texture of the goo is one of the few weaknesses of this movie. THE EXORCIST retains is strong elements of acting and drama. The first third of this movie is remarkable for its almost independent and prescient approach to photography and directing almost presaging the future of quality film-making - JARHEAD (2005) comes to mind. As memory recalls only the fine, captivating technical medical scenes of the novel were moderately transferred to the film (but for adaptation purposes only perhaps). Overall, this movie minus the clanking old aging medical equipment and strange looking police cars, still keeps its amazing quality of one of the signature horror films of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

On all levels, the acting, screenplay, photography, colors, cast, mood everything is perfect. It is way beyond a ""horror"" film. It is similar to The Omen but in some ways better. Ellen Burstyn is amazing in this film! Father Karras (Jason Miller) is amazing, you cannot take your eyes off him. Sad life unfortunately.

A Disappointment,"Since its release, ""The Exorcist"" seems to have played a very large role in the popular culture.  Even 25 years after its original opening, references to projectile vomiting or someone turning their head all the way around immediately recall this movie.  So, when I finally sat down to watch this film, I had high expectations.  Sadly, these expectations were not met. The effects were very well done, and the movie was quite scary in places (more so than silly slasher flicks like ""Friday the 13th"", anyway), but the plot and character development left much to be desired.  Ellen Burstyn's character, the mother of the possessed girl, is one-dimensional at best, and is frequently very annoying, while Max von Sydow's Father Merrin seems almost totally undeveloped despite spending a fair amount of time on the screen.  The only human character with any interesting development at all is Jason Miller's Father Karras.  The most important character, though, and the one whose development is perhaps most lacking, is the Devil himself. He possesses this little girl, and does all sorts of disgusting and violent things with her, but his motives in doing so are totally unexplained.  In this regard, the climax of the film also seems terribly silly.  Frankly, if the sort of stuff shown in this film is the best that the Devil can do, I wouldn't be too terribly scared of him.Overall Rating: 5 (out of 10), or 2 stars (out of 4)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It will scare the HELL out of you...and the Heaven back into you,"This film will scare the hell out of you...literally. If you've been brought up as a Christian as I was (I am a Catholic right from the cradle) and start having doubts about the existence of God, Satan, Heaven, and Hell, I strongly urge you to watch this film. The direction, art, staging, and acting of the principals involved was calculated to keep your stomach in knots and goose pimples as large as acne, all over your body from start to finish, and it succeeds in every way. You'll be riveted to your seat throughout this film, and don't be surprised if you have an extremely strong desire to go to the nearest church afterword, because you will. You'll need to, after you watch...""The Exorcist."" Watch this film. But don't do it alone. I watched this film in 1973 at the age of 17 at a local theater with a friend when it was first released (they were handing out sickness bags at the door). Afterword, you'll have no doubt WHATSOVEVER of the existence of God and his powerful and saving Love and Grace. You'll also have no doubt WHATSOEVER of the heinous evil of Satan and his horrific powers of destruction. I was an Alter Boy dropout as well as a Church dropout. But after seeing ""The Exorcist,"" I went back to my church. This film is ABSOLUTELY the scariest, most frightening, and most vivid film in the history of film making. This film was based upon a real exorcism (in real life, a young boy was possessed) and one of the priests involved with the real exorcism was interviewed (I forget on which network) sometime in 1999 along with William Peter Blatty (who was a news reporter at the time of the real exorcism) who wanted to write a series of stories based upon that possession and ultimate exorcism. He was allowed to (by the Church) only after agreeing to change the identities involved and their location, (the people involved craved privacy and Mr. Blatty, being an honorable, decent, and responsible man, acquiesced) instead using pseudonyms and other locations. The result was the book and film, ""The Exorcist,"" a very true, and very real story of the horrors of demonic possession, the exorcism of the demons, and the aftermath. After seeing this film, you'll ABSOLUTELY have no doubt WHATSOEVER of the existence of God, Satan, Heaven, and Hell, for they all DO EXIST! It's up to us to decide which we want to follow.

Dated but still effective horror film.,"The reputation of ""The Exorcist"" film was such, that I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first saw this when the ban on the film had been lifted. I saw the film at the cinema in 1998 and I enjoyed it but it hasn't dated too well. The special effects for their time may have been pretty good but nowadays, they wouldn't satisfy most audiences. What still works about ""The Exorcist,"" is the way it is written, directed and acted. It is in one sense, a good old fashioned story about Good vs Evil. Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, Jason Miller and Linda Blair take the acting honours between them. The making of the film was just as eventful as anything that occurred in the film itself. About 9 people who were directly or indirectly associated with the film, met with sudden deaths. It makes one wonder if the film set was cursed! It was a long time in the making - over a year altogether but it was worth it. The screenplay is one of the best I have come across for a horror film.

The power of Faith goes up against Misery and Despair !!!,"It is pretty useless to start this review by summarising the basic plot of 'The Exorcist', because let's face it, even people who haven't really seen the film know what it is about in a cursory way. Everyone knows that this film has a girl supposedly possessed by a demon named Pazuzu, but people who read between the lines, will know that this is not just a horror film with scares(which are there),it's also about existentialism and it deals with bigger issues.I think 'The Exorcist' is extremely layered. It is open to literally infinite interpretations. I am pretty sure my interpretation of the meaning of this film might be radically different to some other viewer's. Personally I think, this is a horror film, but it's not about the supernatural from a thematic standpoint. I think all the scenes involving supernatural elements and antics are supposed to be metaphorical. Friedkin has to be really appreciated for making a film that says so much without showing a lot. I watched the director's cut and was really impressed by the fact that so many things were merely hinted at without Friedkin giving you details about them. Those subtle hints and their implications can completely change your view of the film and your perspective. I completely agree with Roger Ebert's opinion that 'The Exorcist' is a very Begmanesque existential film that deals with questions of faith and despair. The most significant thing that the film talks about is the relevance and importance of faith in this cruel, hopeless world filled with misery, despair and cynicism. The film says the world is a cruel place where with every passing day our faith and belief in God will be questioned, but at times of great trouble, we will have nothing else to resort to apart from faith in humanity and God, irrespective of whether you believe in God or not, and that faith can help us get the better of our demons. William Friedkin brilliantly captures the existential feel of the William Peter Blatty novel and also Blatty's screenplay.Linda Blair as Regan is probably one of the most iconic horror film characters of all time and her 'possessed' face is something that has scared people through generations. Ellen Burstyn is also good as Chris, the mother who feels helpless at the prospect of finding a cure for her daughter's problem which she doesn't understand. Max Von Sydow has dealt with existentialism and faith throughout his acting career because of his frequent collaborations with the legend Ingmar Bergman and he is brilliant and very convincing in the short,but very significant role of Father Merrin in this film. But having said all that, I should say that this film belongs to Jason Miller as the Father Karras. Miller comes up with a heartbreaking performance portraying the inner struggle that his character is going through. We are shown that events in his life, particularly the ones involving his mother and all the misery in the world that he has seen due to his constant contact with the general people as a priest has led him to gradually lose faith in God and religion. I think thematically, Karras is the most significant character in the film and his character's arc helps Friedkin to end the film on an optimistic note.This is without a doubt Friedkin's best film. Although 'The French Connection' and 'The Exorcist' are completely different films both plot-wise and theme-wise, however I still could see some similarities between them in the way that Friedkin uses the two colours- blue and red artistically to give them a meaning and to visually imply certain things. Friedkin brilliantly raises tension in the film without using jump scares(there is one of them though). Some stills and shots of the film are breathtaking and almost goose bump-inducing.'The Exorcist' is one of those films that leaves the door wide open for endless interpretations. Every person's take on it can differ. It is artistically shot, brilliantly acted and it has a deep, meaningful thematically rich script thanks to Batty. I repeat, as far as I am concerned, 'The Exorcist' is not about ghosts and demons in the literal sense, but it still is one of the greatest horror films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Time and influence have dulled its power but still an engaging film.,"(comments based on the director's cut)As the best known and best received demon possession film much of the current crop of horror films owe a lot to this gem of the 70's. The Nun (2018) probably wouldn't exist without the success of this film. Many common horror tropes get worked into this story. Psychological horror being more intense than physical horror. Old age religion having problems with new age sexuality is a major theme in the story. Or how the characters ending up regaining their faith in God because of the devil. It goes as far as sound design and discordant images being used. The jump scares are plentiful here and you can see why that aspect has become a cliche in horror. This makes the film very fun to spot its influence but it also has made it less intense and less scary watching it today.It is a minor issue because while the visceral horror is gone the wonderful atmospherics, deeply impressive effects, and engaging story remain. The direction in this film is a solid technically dazzling piece of work. The film remains creepy in large part because of the skill of Friedkin. That is not to say the film isn't well acted. It is very well acted. Surprisingly graceful and naturalistic the entire cast is undeniably intense and striking.I think the real key to this film's success is just how long the build up to the full blown horror scenes is. Well over an hour is spent laying down story threads and characterization. It gives the eventual chills thematic and emotional weight. Such a fine piece of story conception in terms of pacing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Different,"Where should I start?There are many things that make The Exorcist a truly unique film. A movie like this hadn't been made before when it came out, and it took everyone who saw it by surprise.Many things shown in this were past the lines that people thought had been drawn in movie-making: The girl's head spinning 360 degrees, the multiple obscenities spoken by the possessed throughout the film, need I mention the crucifix scene? Before The Exorcist, the only popular religion-based horror movie that I know of was Rosemarie's Baby, and in comparison, that wasn't even edgy.However, I personally think this movie relies on its shocks more than its actual scares. I find this movie more shocking and disgusting (green projectile vomit, anyone?) than scary. The actual scary scenes I saw in this were the spider-crawl down the stairs, and, of course, the crucifix scene. Other than that, it's mostly profanity and green vomit.I guess you do have to see this movie at least once in your life, though, because it has a GREAT soundtrack (Tubular Bells), and you will never find another movie like it.3/4",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Timeless. But....,"When I first watched it I was very effected by it. Mainly because I was watching it on a computer where I could turn the volume down if something scary happened. But watching it with a audience is just great and it shows the intense impact the movie had on people 40 years ago. But... I just feel that the characters you cannot relate to.Ellen Burstyn, the mother has a extremely short temper and does not listen to anything the doctors say and instead decides to scream at people because she is a huge immature child. I don't care about Sharon because she is barely in it, Reagan is just there to shock people which the actress Linda Blair does a excellent job at.The effects are also frightening. The head spinning scene is one of the most memorable scenes in movie history.Even though some characters are filled with hate and the movie might be too much for some, The Exorcist is a timeless classic and every horror film fan should see it.88/100 B+",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil,"This is a horror film. The monster in it is a supernatural entity claiming to be no less than The Devil. It possesses a twelve year old girl and the horrors happening as a result won't stop whatever science tries, medicine, to be more exact, and it is only through a religious way that the monster can be driven away. The story itself isn't very complicated, and the story isn't why the film has been so successful, it is how it is executed. When it comes to portraying the things happening, the authenticity is impressive. When it comes to telling the story, organizing it, placing pieces of it one after the other and putting it all together, ""The Exorcist"" is methodical and unrelenting. Things keep escalating and it does not become any easier to see the next scare coming. It is an adrenaline ride, nothing less.Again, the package is no problem whatsoever, nothing seriously wrong with either the visuals or the sounds. Speaking of the sounds, specifically, there may not be much music in the film, but where it is, it is enough to chill the audience to the bone. However, ""The Exorcist"" isn't perfect, even though the reputation it has can easily make you feel otherwise. The power of the horror story here may be undisputed, especially, if you remember how old the film is, but that power comes down to using sounds and images, not to storytelling in general. Yes, there are scary things in the film, some of them too scary, perhaps, and they are put together in a way that creates a sequence of growing scares, but this is all mechanics and has barely anything to do with storytelling in general, with the characters the story is built around. And when it comes to the characters here, they aren't very interesting, nothing great to any of them, it's all basic and simple, and probably the most interesting one of them is the detective investigating things, and he isn't even one of the main characters. He's patient, careful, intelligent, and won't tell you all he knows. And he's looking for the truth here.The truth is what science wants. And in this film, science is shown weak, unable to deal with what the problem is. Religion is the solution. Science and religion haven't been best friends throughout our history. And with how simple the story told here is, it isn't meant for certain individuals, it is meant to make an impression on big masses of people, and with how real the whole thing feels, it can encourage belief. Belief, not knowledge, and with how scary certain scenes are, it can put ""the fear of God"" in you.Steve Miner's ""Warlock"", for example, also deals with a supernatural villain, and the heroes mostly use supernatural ways to deal with the monster. But the supernatural alone can't get the job done, and they end up using something that comes from the world of science, from invention and knowledge, not from religion alone. It's like the film says both religion and science are important. Based on William Peter Blatty's book and directed by William Friedkin, ""The Exorcist"" is pro religion, period, science is helpless. It's like the film wants the audience to disregard knowledge and progress. Hardly a positive thing to teach people, unless you want to go back to the middle ages and everything that comes with it, excluding the accomplishments of science, such as medicine.Anyway, long story short, this is a strong horror film, but it may be a little overrated because it relies heavily on the package and does not work as carefully with the contents, it has a simple story with barely any interesting characters. And it seems to love religion and hate science. That isn't great either.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror movie which I liked,For along time I hadn't watch horror movies.because it became full of scenes of blood .I liked that movie as it's taking about the devil and the power of faith. I liked so much the beginning of the movie with the sound of Azan to represent being in northern Iraq.The searching process for ancient cultures which which reveals the whole mystery of the movieAlthough..In some cases people who don't believe in God .. When they are in a real trouble and can't find any way..they finally find the answer at the door which they refused to knock . The stupid human nature that make us do the same mistake over and over again.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Simple but scary,The movie is so simple even the story but it is scary talking about the ghost ! People telling that it's the scariest movie ever but I don't think so. You can watch it in a idle room too and you will not get scared ! But the ghost is really something !,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
More Funny Than Scary!,"The Exorcist. Whenever you ask anyone about it, they go on saying how scary it is. *WRONG!* To be honest, I really don't see what all the fuss is about. I'm Quite Young, And before i watched it my Mum warned me that It would be too ""scary"" for me and that she was frightened watching it. I was Totally Surprised, It wasn't Scary At All. It Takes A Lot to scare me, But my 9-year old brother was rolling around the floor Laughing. How can ANYONE call this Film "" The Scariest Film Ever Made "" ? I just Don't Understand it. The Acting Wasn't Much Special, And the Storyline was Rather Simple. A Good Horror Film Needs Suspense, Excitement And a Chill running through your spine. I'd Give this film a 1/10 Because It was COMPLETE and UTTER RUBBISH. At The Start, It was Very boring, I Couldn't Help But Fall Asleep. During the Supposedly Scarier Parts I Was in a Fit of Laughter. Honestly. If you want a REAL fright, Watch The Grudge, Creep Or My Favourite horror movie ever ; The Shining. To Put All Of That Very Briefly, All I Can Say Is.. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING IT!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The most famous horror film ever made!!!.,"Wow you could write a book on this film dont worry iam not going to.Ok so it was 76 or before and an audience was just sitting down to watch the film ,remember all the horror films they were used to are at that time is hammer horrors and John carpenter and Tobe Hopper great film makers.And then came along the exorcist and totally destroyed the audience both mentality and physically.The problem was this film was about twenty years ahead of its self, and twenty years to soon for the big screen as well.The general public at that time in are history had suffered also  from viewing this film.Some had died of heart attacks or killed themselves after viewing the film, babies had been lost through shock and stress and reports of other health issues relating to the film ,no wonder back then there was religious groups handing out leaflets warning people not to view this film.The mystery of these causes did not stop there.I think it was about 8 or 9 members of the film crew died of unknown or un- natrual causes as well while in the making of the film.Images appeared on still photos of the set and film.The most disturbing scene in the film is the spider clip of linda blair coming down the stairs, why this was not included in the film is beyond me that had to be the best scene ever used in horror film  cinema history.You can see this clip and other really interesting info in the fear of god, a documentary on the exorcist film as well as the film lts self, but this may only be available in england iam not sure.One of the younger priests who was shooting a scene went for lunch a small restaurant was across the road from the set there the actor sat down to have some lunch ,there he had got talking to a real priest,the real priest warned him the devil does not like to be shown the way  the film was portraying him to the world he will seek retribution on all those that portrayed him this way said the priest, true stuff honest!!.I actually watched the true documentary story on a satellite channel  a few years ago  a  story of a young boy that had become possessed.The exorcist film had used one or two pieces in the film.This documentary scared the pants of me.A summary of this film is the exorcist is  as dark as it can get it is based on a true story just to make matters worse.If you have not seen this film you must off been dead or in space for the last 25 years sure it was banned for some time, but its out now the question is are you ready to watch it, be advised watch it with caution!!!!.As one councellor said in a reveiw of the exorcist in a british horror magazine called the darkside"" know person can sit through this film with out it having some sort of effect on that person viewing such material"".",,Anonymous,Horror
This is The Godfather of Horror,"It's exactly what everyone wants, but can hardly put a name to. It's creepy, but not overwhelmingly. It's clever, but not trying to be. It's emotional, but not so much you get lost in it. The story is so creatively and perfectly well told that I can't help but gush. It's one of those movies that was directed perfectly, and also has the other cool things that probably just happened by luck. I don't know how to explain it, but its got those super-natural supernatural parts. Awesome. Everyone like the ""super-natural supernatural"" pun little thing?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fantastic haunting movie,"This movie in my opinion is one of the greatest movies ever made,. I first saw this as a teenager in the 1980""s. I believe if you are of the young generation, then it may not have the same effect, younger people have grown up watching shocking films. But this film was so well made and acted that it is seems hard to believe it is not real. It is one of the only films
that truly creeps me out and is psychologically
disturbing. It is a slightly slow build but highly recommended. This film has had a number of imitations. It's a shame that other horror are not as ground breaking as this one. The best.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The greatest horror movie. Ever.,"Ive held off reviewing this movie for years as it is one of the few that deserve 11 stars. I'll need to update and and do it justice. but for now, I'll capture the high lights why it's so good.
1. This doesn't use CGI or jump scares to affect your fear. It doesn't need to. By building up a very unknown and alien evil that we never truly see, your imagination will take care of that. What are the beings inside Ragen? who are the ""us"" referred to by the creature? Why does it get to boss around the others? Why do they feel it's fun to torture a little girl and kill priests. You don't need to be Catholic to be creeped out and deeply affected.
2. We can all empathize. Like The Fly, being taken over by an alien force that over powers us, is familiar to a teen in love all as it is to someone diagnosed with a disease. It's never easy, always uncomfortable and you'll never be the same after. And, we get to visualize the effects, in real time as Ragen transforms into the grotesque corporel representation of that foreign agency, which no one can control.
3. Plays on our fears of the unknown in the thereafter. Where do we go after death? Are there ghosts and demons? Is what we do in this world relevant in another? These are deep questions raised by this horror movie...
4. The visuals, sounds, score and language in almost ever scene is creepy, deep and/or dark. There's human pain, fear, triumph, redemption, empathy jealousy etc.. all raw emotions that move and control people. All this erases any thought of comedy or lightness that's built in to the horror genre.
5. The Devil is portrayed in its darkest form here.So, in summation, this movie has all the qualities of excellent dramas and thrillers wrapped in a scary package that hits all the right notes at the right time - terrifying us to the core. This is why, for me, this is the first and last truly scary horror fiction ever made. Period.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing Compares To This Ageless Classic,"It was marketed as ""The Scariest Movie Ever Made"" almost 50 years ago. It was then and it still is today. Yet it is so much more than a horror movie. It is, quite simply, a perfect film.The story of a young girl tortured by a demon is wonderfully constructed, perfectly paced and utterly believable. The deathly atmosphere of pervading dread and relentless despair drips from every frame. The performances of Miller, Burstyn, Cobb and Von Sydow have us riding on their shoulders. And Linda Blair is just astonishing as the tormented, desperate child.These were the days before CGI. Before Industrial Light and Magic. Yet every Satanic set piece stands the test of time. Add to this Blatty's sharp, intelligent script and a Director in Friedkin at the pinnacle of his powers and what we have is more than just a mere film. It's a phenomenon. A creation of such power and brutal fury that it transcends the genre of horror. It is movie making in its purest form. A fairy tale for our sad, cynical age. A battle between good and evil.It is not just ""The Scariest Movie Ever Made"" it is, for me, without doubt ""The Best Movie Ever Made"". 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Exorcist,"The Exorcist caused a lot of controversy in the early seventies, and it's still easy to see why. It has great shock value and is a master class in audience manipulation, however, narrative wise it's a mess. Director William Friedkin is not any where nearly as effective at story telling as he is in creating an atmosphere of dread and giving the audience plenty of shock/horror moments. It's still quite a ride though, but I still think The Omen (1976) was much more effective overall.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Greatest Horror Film in History,"There's a reason this is considered the scariest movie of all time, it pushed the boundaries of horror in ways never done before and dragged its audience down a rabbit hole of terror from which they would never emerge. Not only is its subject matter terrifying to contemplate but its happening to a 12 year old girl, a pure innocent caught in the crossfire between good and evil. The Exorcist takes every element available to it and weaponises it to strike terror into the hearts of its audience, lighting, sound and composition all turned against the viewer to create a surreal and monstrous experience. Linda Blair's exceptional performance as the tormented Regan will live on in infamy, while the film itself as an entity of pure horror cannot be unseen, cannot be unexperienced and can never be outdone.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"So, So, So Overrated","I will admit this film is good, but it is not, I repeat is not the greatest scary movie of all time. That loving honor should befall to much greater films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974, of Course), Friday The 13th: The Final Chapter, Pet Sematary, Dawn Of The Dead, Hellraiser, SAW, The Devil's Rejects, and what I consider to be the best horror film of all time Carnivale of Souls. There are many others that are better I just named the ones that are at the top of there game. The Exorcist has huge gaping holes of logic missing that you could only believe and fall into it's trappings if you were a catholic. I am not. I find the movie to be painstakingly slow and uneventful. I guess if you find jump cuts and loud noises to be scary then this movie is for you. I also hate how William Fredkin is so prissy about everything, like he is the grandmaster of cinema, sorry that spot goes to Wes Craven who himself made a far, far better film only a year earlier and in a shorter amount of time and with a lot less money. That film was of course Last House on the Left. I suggest seeing that as it will shock you far more and it is indeed grounded in reality unlike this turd of a film. I do however think that Jason Miller is a fine actor and I wish he could have gone on to a better career than he had. Sad that this film is what he'll be remembered for. Sit this one out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The one and only ...,"Seeing the 25th Anniversary video release of The Exorcist brought me back to Dec. 28, 1973.  That first viewing of the film has to rank as one of the top three movie-going experiences of my life.  I was one of about 700 people in the audience, but we were all reacting as a single entity to the brilliant way the film was constructed: tension balanced with release, silence followed by horrifying blasts of sound effects and the unforgettable voice of the demon.  Terror was being shared by every person in that room, and you could actually feel it.  I have never seen any other movie that had such a powerful effect on an audience.I also remember, when the movie ended and my 3 friends and I walked back to the bus station, that none of us spoke to each other.  Not about the movie, or about anything else.  Any horror movie that can do that has to be the scariest ever made.  There will probably never be another one quite like it.A lot of the comments here say The Exorcist is slow and boring, especially in the first hour.  For me there's not one wasted moment or image in the film.  The slow pace is necessary to create a sense of total reality, of the world these characters live in, so that you come to care about them and believe everything that happens to them later on, no matter how fantastic. And everything you see in the first half (Merrin's face-off with the demon statue, Chris's glimpses of Karras in the streets, her foul language on the phone, Karras' love of his mother and his horrible guilt over her death, the old guy on the subway platform) pays off in the second half.All my favorite horror films (Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, Jaws) have this same structure of a slow methodical build-up before the terror begins, making the terror that much more terrifying.  I guess that's just the way I like 'em - never did care much for Jason and Freddy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Classic That Won't Be Forgotten,This film is unique in the way that most films to not stick to somebody like this one does. They did an amazing job making it seem plausible and making it memorable.

"A disturbing drama where the horror isn't reliant on shock or disturbing imagery, but on the ideas behind them.","If you're in the mood for a dark drama about a mother who's struggling to find a cure for whatever illness has taken over her daughter, who is then pushed to the limit of recruiting a Catholic priest, who himself doesn't even believe in exorcisms, then this is the movie for you.Is this movie a horror? Well it's not scary in the same way that most modern horror movies are. The Exorcist is scary in that we're seeing the transformation of a young innocent girl into something unnatural, and a mother's struggle to deal with the situation.There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said. I recommend this film, but don't set up your expectations for a modern shock horror.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
