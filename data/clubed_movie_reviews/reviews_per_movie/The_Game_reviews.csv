Michael Douglas at his very best,"""The Game"" took me on one psychological thrill ride after another loaded with twists and turns scene after scene.Michael Douglas pulled off his best performance as Nicholas Van Orton a man who is approaching his birthday. Upon which he receives an invitation to play a game given to him by his brother Conrad played by Sean Penn. Nicholas reluctantly agrees and soon finds out that the game is more than he bargained for.I thoroughly enjoyed this film because I never knew who was trustworthy or what was going to happen next, this truly was one film that must be seen by those who enjoy never knowing for sure how a movie will turn out.""The Game"" is all Michael Douglas and how well he pulls off his role of being the innocent who happens to be in the middle of a game he can't control. However, a really good movie can not be pulled off by one actor, a whole lot of credit should go to Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger for their convincing portrayals in this film.",,Anonymous,Mystery
An intelligent tale from start to finish.,"Let me just tell you that, as a middle aged film buff, I have seen my share of flicks, good and bad. Very few rate as high as ""The Game"" in entertainment value. ""The Game"" is most definitely one of the ""most fun"" movies to hit the silver screen in a long time. Filled with plot twists and turns, this film takes the movie-goer on a psychological roller coaster ride from the tile screens to the final credit roll.""The Game"" is truly an intelligent tale, sort of a brain teaser that you get to watch and listen to, with a time limit. You have just 128 minutes to solve this, and chances are, like me, you'll be hanging on the solution to this puzzle until the very end.The script was well written by a writer who clearly understands the needs of an adult audience. Yes, we like our fun but we like to exercise our brains once in a while also. And let there be no mistake about the great performances offered here by Michael Douglas and his co-stars. I was engrossed by all and couldn't take my eyes of the screen.There is plenty for everybody here. Fun for all. A big winner in my book and definitely on my list of all time favorites.

For 128 spirited minutes The Game takes your mind and twists it ruthlessly, contorting it in any way it so desires.  Michael Douglas is the perfect actor for this role, he played it flawlessly.

I was surprised how much I enjoyed this one.,"Sean Penn is not the most popular celebrity and has created a few enemies over the years.

THE GAME is exceptional...and you'd be doing yourself a favor by watching it. THE GAME is one heck of a great film, as I give it a well-deserved score of 9 because it's so well written and entertaining. It is one of the most exciting and riveting films of recent memory.

The Game is ON.,"I was hungry like anything when I started watching this movie and that was the only time I felt hungry. 2 hours and 3 minutes passed like you are playing your favorite GAME and could not concentrate anything else. If you think Micheal Douglas is an over rated actor then this movie is enough to prove you wrong. Sean Penn does full justice to his cameo. This is not a movie that leaves you with puzzles after watching unlike many mystery thrillers, instead it solves itself and relaxes your muscles after a rough ride. This is a movie with an engrossing script, excellent acting and flawless direction. If you have not watched this movie yet then PLAY it. You wont regret it all. Entertainment at its best. Now I can have my snacks and you go watch it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Twists upon twists, amazing filming, stunning acting, and a preposterous end","The Game (1997)The steely intensity of Michael Douglas comes to play once again here in a role where that determination keeps getting waylaid by the mixed-up birthday present he's been handed, somewhat against his will.Or against his better judgement, at first, because he does sign off on playing ""The Game,"" which is an experience with a bow. That is, without any good clues about who the players are or why it's quite happening, except that his birthday has come and gone, events begin to happen around him that are inexplicable. And that he can't ignore.Intensity rules. Douglas, playing the obscenely wealthy Nicholas Van Orton, gets led further and further into the madness and crime and murder of this huge huge charade. Or so it seems.In a manner the director, David Fincher, is cozy with, reality bends but psychology seems to be solid. That is, you are secure, somehow, in the main actor's head as the world distorts. The main example is of course ""The Fight Club,"" the distortions are almost literal in the more ordinary ""Panic Room,"" and the world is somewhat friendlier in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" Yes, these are all Fincher films (as is the brand new American version ""Dragon Tattoo"" flick and the riveting ""Se7en"").The production and the shooting and editing in particular are all first rate, classic Fincher. Douglas plays his part with conviction and you end up not quite sympathizing with him (he's a spoiled jerk even as his world evaporates) but you certainly are in his shoes, wondering what is going on. It's crazy and exciting and certainly baffling for a viewer--which is part of the game, actually. The viewer is another layer in the layers of perceivable reality.And then it just goes too far. In a way, the film is preposterous from the start, but yet you go along with the idea because very rich people have very unusual lives, and maybe this kind of mind-trip birthday present with lots of people participating could happen. Money moves mountains. But when things get almost comically absurd, when the twists of identity and loyalty keep happening, you want to just say, walk away. Get a grip. Refuse to play, or maybe (at least) refuse to believe things like this are possible.This is where Michael Douglas is perfect, and maybe does what few actors could pull off. Because as it gets insane, his character toughs it out. He's the type to take a challenge, to get extreme, to be risky, to protect his self-interests without surrender.In some ways it's a great movie, so watch it as if it'll never let you go. And when it's just too much, be glad you went along for as long as you did. And enjoy the rest of the show for its theatrics. It remains really well made all through.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Tight, twisted and tense - one of the most interesting thrillers of the '90s","Having conquered the critics (and the box-office) with Se7en, David Fincher could have ""sold out"" and kept delivering more of the same. Fortunately, he was wise enough to try different paths, and although all his movies can be classified as thrillers there's no real similarity between them, except maybe a common theme of alienation and solitude.In Fincher's third film, The Game, that solitude is physically incarnated by Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), a wealthy businessman who is so obsessed with his job he has forgotten everything about the simple joys of life. The only person who still stays in touch with him is his younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn), who is Nicholas' polar opposite in terms of attitude. One night, when they're out to celebrate the elder brother's birthday, Conrad mentions a ""game"" that changed his life and suggests Nicholas participate too, as it would be ""fun"". Though initially hesitant, the latter eventually gives in to curiosity and decides to give it a shot. Within a few hours, however, he will regret it: the ""game"" is actually some sort of conspiracy involving everyone in town. With his assets frozen, his apartment no longer a safe place and no one left to trust, Nicholas must figure out how to solve the problem before it's too late - for him or someone else...As usual, Fincher makes sure the film works on a technical level, cleverly using camera angles, lighting (shades of red and brown being the dominant color) and editing to keep the suspense alive and the atmosphere conveniently murky. It is mainly this masterful handling of film-making tools that keeps the viewer from questioning the logic of the nonetheless brilliant screenplay, some of the twists giving the impression of a dystopic set-up rather than a plausible situation (and yet the script is supposedly based on a real event). Two other elements contribute to elevating The Game above the average mystery tale: a truly unpredictable, phenomenal ending, in pure Fincher tradition (well, at least until he made Panic Room), and the great work by the leading men, Douglas' paranoid desperation slyly erasing all hints of typecasting (after all, this is not the first time he has played someone who is being manipulated; in fact, one scene explicitly spoofs one of those previous movies) and Penn's smug anarchy anticipating director's masterpiece, Fight Club, and its central character, Tyler Durden (without a doubt Brad Pitt's best role to date).In short, those looking for a ""different"" cinematic experience should give The Game a try: it might come off as overly cold or contrived at first, but like all of Fincher's movies it deserves a re-evaluation (Fight Club wasn't exactly a hit when originally released) and stands the test of time as one of the most original, smartest films of the '90s.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"....and when it was all over, I was blown away","Very few films have captured my attention the way The Game did. Every turn, every corner seemed to have some hint of intrigue and deception. This film would be the life's work for any major film maker, but then again, this David Fincher were talking about.Years from now, when Fincher is honored with his lifetime achievement award at the Academy Awards, his true fans will always remember this film. It put a whole new twist on the idea of ""plot-twist."" One of the few films me and my father both liked (we never agree on any film).",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An extremely underrated movie,"After the great success, both with critics and with the public, of ""Seven"", Director David Fincher turned to this film. It has often been said that this movie was one he'd wanted to make for a long time and upon viewing you can really see his belief in both characters and the story- overall an excellently directed movie.Although several people argued that ""Seven"" was gory, in my opinion it wasn't, for example, there is a total lack of blood in the Lust scene, something which I particularly admired- the fact that a director could make a chilling and shocking movie without resorting to piling tons of blood onto the screen. Fincher continues this streak in ""The Game"" by drawing the tension and shocks of the film by using psychological terror.Unfortunately, the movie could not parallel the success of ""seven"" upon its release and also received mixed critical reviews, however since then it has become somewhat of a cult movie with far more success on DVD than in the box office.Perhaps most notable about the film is the fact that (apparently) Fincher himself often seems to direct his actors in a detached way, the way one might move around chess pieces in a game. Whether this is 100% true or not his direction, the acting and just about everything else is superb.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

My favorite movie of all times and not for the obvious reasons.,"I first saw this on VHS tape when it first came out. It was not in theaters long enough for word of mouth to drive a wave of references. This was the only movie I ever had to immediately rewind, gather the family and watch it again that night. Do not watch on TV where it is has been cut for time. What I liked about this film is that every frame and every scene was important to the story. There are no puppy in the window filler shots. I applaud the writing and the directing for such an intricate weaving of ""The Game"" concept. Not a film for those with no patience or interest in covert operations. I now enjoy watching others watch this film as they start to recognize things and try to figure out what is going on, only to be wrong several times. I see something new every time I watch it. Brilliant concept and execution of the concept on film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One twist too many almost completely ruins an otherwise effective thriller.,"For its majority, 'The Game (1997)' is a well-made, compelling thriller. Fincher gives the film a great atmosphere and Douglas is excellent in the leading role. After a fairly slow but necessary set-up, the eponymous 'Game' begins and from there the thing is fast-moving and exciting. Sure, there are a few things that don't really make all that much sense and require a certain suspension of disbelief, but you sort of just go with it and it isn't really an issue for a long time. It's full of twists and turns, constantly keeping the audience as uncertain of the truth as our protagonist; this works for the most part. Frustratingly though, the film falls hard at the final hurdle. It has one twist too many, one that completely derails all that has come before. By including this final reveal, most of the film actually makes no sense - suspending disbelief isn't going to help you here. It asks you to accept that absolutely absurd things have been happening throughout the film in order to accept the ending, which actually makes a lot of what has come before seem rather comical. The protagonist also has such an out-of-character reaction to the reveal that it feels like some kind of dream sequence. It's a fantasy-like ending to a previously serious, mostly grounded thriller that leaves an absolutely sour taste in the mouth. Thankfully though, while you're on the ride it is entertaining and successfully thrilling, primarily thanks to Fincher's involvement. However, it does come to a highly unsatisfying screeching halt that makes you forget that it is actually well-done for 90% of its runtime. As a whole, it's unfortunately just shiny schlock. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Fascinating,"Essentially, The Game is an interesting and fascinating film. While it is overlong, and lacking in credibility at the end, plus it is not Fincher's best film(Se7en) it does have a lot to like about it. As is the case with David Fincher, the film is visually stunning, with intriguing shots and camera angles and bold, stylish colours. Fincher's direction is ambitious and also very good, while the film's pace is brisk, the script is well crafted and the story is a great idea and is very gripping up until the ending. The acting is very good, Michael Douglas is perfectly cast as the increasingly desperate pawn and Sean Penn is equally impressive in a role that I actually think could have been bigger. All in all, it is a very good film, yes with its foibles but it is an intriguing idea constructed in an entertaining way. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You might be rich and have a luxurious lifestyle, you might be able to buy and do basically anything, but will you?Michael Douglas delivered a fantastic performance as an average boring businessman, whose life took a big turn and transformed from boring to a complete thriller. We all were probably a bit confused at the end when we realized what had happened. Personally I didn't expect that at all, and I think that's a great thing.No doubt a great film with a great meaning.

Fincher's under appreciated gem.,"I don't tend to write reviews on IMDb, but saw this gem and was compelled to do so simply due to the fact it isn't mentioned AT ALL, by anyone. It's one of Fincher's best films and deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as Fight Club, Se7en etc etc.It starts by slowly showing us the world of Nicholas (Michael Douglas) and how he's alone on his 48th birthday. He receives and odd gift off of his brother which he then decides to follow up on. What follows then is sheer cinematic brilliance. It's dark, unpredictable and unrelenting. It got to a point where any single character couldn't be trusted, and it made it all the more gripping. Seeing the protagonist descend slowly into desperation made us feel empathy for him. There's not much to say other than it's a typical Fincher film. Including his long tracks, his persistent use of the tripod, and I think it really compliments the story and builds up this sense of unease.I just needed to express my gratitude for everyone who worked on this film and obviously David Fincher himself. It's so underrated and should be classed as one of his best films - without a shadow of a doubt.Enjoy. You won't want it to end.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Full of surprises,"""The Game"" is about a wealthy investment banker, called Nicholas Van Orton, who is given a mysterious birthday present by his brother Conrad. When he participates in this game, unusual events happen that interfere with his daily routine, endangering his life. The closer he gets to figuring out the master behind the game, the more dangerous the events get, making him become closer to death. He must risk everything he has to discover the deadly secret.The director, David Fincher, creates this film in a great way. The earlier success of his previous film ""Seven"" gave the producers of ""The Game"" an opportunity to acquire a higher profit. The film was eventually ranked #44 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.This thriller successfully holds suspense the whole way through. The incidents displayed throughout the film are shown in a sequence that continually makes us wonder what is happening, and the rapid change in events keeps us watching. There is a wide range of occurrences happening throughout the movie, which only make sense at the end of the story, so once we have seen a few of the experiences that Nicholas must go through, we are dragged into the film, continually wondering who is good, who is bad, and how the events all link together.I recommend this film to anyone who likes mystery story's, thrills and suspense. It is fantastically structured, and it is a must see for anyone who likes films in this genre.8/10 - ""The Game"" is full of surprises and should not be missed!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The atmosphere is perfectly eerie, and the direction by David Fincher is top-notch, creating a palpable sense of dread.But then we hit the final act, and everything just starts to unravel. What began as a mind-bending journey through paranoia and manipulation collapses under the weight of an ending that feels too contrived and overblown. Instead of a satisfying conclusion, I felt like I was watching a trick that had overstayed its welcome.

Definitely an interesting one,"Saw this on Netflix and I was fished in by the premise of this film and overall I have to say that I did enjoy it.What the film did really well was keep you entertained and interested in the story and the reason why that's the more important than usual is, because you have absolutely no idea what direction the film is heading and how it's going to end. Which is incredibly smart as it's mirroring what Michael Douglas' character is also experiencing. But yeah, for a 2hr 10 film it kept the suspense incredibly well from minute one and I was entertained and interested throughout!The plot itself is very different to what you normally see, but it isn't complicated in anyway. Even though you don't know what direction the film is heading you aren't confused at any stage. So bravo from that front.I do have a couple of issues with the film that I want to mention.Michael Douglas' character is extremely unlikeable throughout, to everyone and anyone he's a proper *insert word of your choice* and comes off very obnoxious. I understand why the character is done that way, but considering the film is basically just him it's very annoying to watch.The ending. I want to say that this isn't a bad ending at all and all the questions you want answering, get answered. However, I found it a tad underwhelming. When a film like this is done, it all hinges on one moment where everything clicks together. So when the ""twist"" happens and the ending comes along I just found the whole thing a bit under done. I'm trying not to give spoilers, but I found everything to be insanely implausible and I couldn't get past it.Overall though, it's a very good thriller still and definitely worthy of a watch if you haven't done so already.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Interesting, If Minor, David Fincher Thriller","I'd not seen this since cinema release, so time had erased pretty much any sense of what happens other than the barest parts of the set-up. That made for an entertaining, diverting watch even if up to 30 minutes could easily have been trimmed at no loss and probably some improvement; the final half hour or so feel especially baggy. The screenplay feels a bit too obvious, and there's some promising reaching after bigger themes that doesn't really take hold. Michael Douglas is good, and the growing sense of paranoia is tangible; I loved how most of the game itself takes place in an eerily deserted night-time San Francisco, planting a suggestion that this might all be in the lead character's literal nightmares. It could have been more, but the still emerging craft and carefully knitted suspense makes it an interesting, if minor, entry in the director's career.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of my favorite movies of all time!,"This film is a masterpiece. Don't phone this one in when you watch it or you will miss subtle details that move the story along. I've watched this movie several times over the years, and I watched it again last night with my 12yo daughter for the first time. It still held up very well, and my daughter enjoyed it.

A psychological thriller which requires you to suspend ALL credibility to enjoy the ride - until that awful ending.,"There are many movies where complete suspension of disbelief is required, and freely given. These are usually fantasies, sci-fi etc., but this film is not one of those. It is set in the ""normal"" world and is essentially about the protagonist (and you the audience) constantly having to guess what is reality and what is part of the Game. Unfortunately, the reality is so ridiculously far-fetched, it makes trying to differentiate it from the fakery completely redundant.Nevertheless it does hold your attention and is entertaining enough, with Michael Douglas doing a good job in the lead role. That is, until the ending. One plot twist too far, where the implausibility dial is turned so high that even having agreed to suspend your disbelief, you just groan in dismay at what they expect you to cop.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Elaborate Prank?,"I enjoyed the film until the big ""reveal"" - the ending. I'm like so many other reviewers that the ending (reveal) was rather a huge let down.

The music at the tail end of the film will leave you wondering.Overall, I really enjoyed the film - just wish there was a bit more to the ending.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I'm 17 years late and I don't regret it,"""The Game"" came out when I was 10 years old, which was my primary obstacle in terms of seeing it sooner than now. The movie gained popularity, and I admit that I should made greater efforts to see it. However, with new movies being released every other week, it is hard to keep track of a movie wish-list. This week, I checked the top-rated films on IMDb and ""The Game"" came up. After watching it, my response is ""better late than never!"" Watching this movie was worth the 17 year wait! There is nothing cheap and desperate about this movie. ""The Game"" is simply a display of high quality cinematography! I am not a film student and have no history or interest in the ""art"" of movie-making. Yet I can recognize great acting, good story-lines, and sufficiently thrilling scenes. To potential viewers, my advice is to remember that I recommended The Game to you! I look forward to the good karma from imparting beneficial advice!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super entertaining,"This is definitely a roller-coaster film that never lets up, throwing nonstop intensity your way, continually remaining unpredictable and serving as the ultimate movie-going escapism. Michael Douglas turns in a likable performance as the perfect character to have so many things go wrong for him, and the dialogue and music craftily add to the suspense; the unnervingly high-pitched piano and deep string music never lets you forget this is a thriller. And the setup and progression of events are so enthralling that even if you don't approve of the outcome, getting there is all the fun. The idea is fascinating, and the way each of the events continues to draw Nick into a more and more complex fantasy is unique and endlessly amusing. His paranoia and uncertainty of what is happening interests us in the same way as if we were engaged in the game ourselves.David Fincher has been making feature length movies since 1992 when he directed the third film in the Alien series. Since then, he's directed eight others, included GWTDT, and has another in pre-production. Fincher will turn 50 years old next year putting him in a generation of filmgoers who love movies like Easy Rider, The Graduate, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and Midnight Cowboy. These are great movies but they are for another generation, not necessarily the one that is targeted in films like Fight Club, or in The Social Network. Fincher has chosen to make movies for the generation following his own and he has captured the eyes of so many with a type of honesty and a type of gritty portrayal that we don't see from a lot of filmmakers targeting that same audience. The way Fincher's movie's look and a feel appeal more to that generation than any other is difficult to put into words but I'll do my best.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Outstanding flick,"Like many of the prior comments here, I found this film engrossing and interesting, in terms of its presenting more intelligent fare than most of the offerings today, on large screen or small. Having recently seen it again, it is also a flick which is one of those as interesting on subsequent viewings as the first.And aside from the excellent cast and performances, and with Michael Douglas, my personal favorite actor -- it managed to combine several genres at once, all of them better-presented than in films where only one would be involved.Science fiction has always presented unexplainable and impossible features compared with ""real life."" Heck, 70 years ago, Buster Crabbe as ""Buck Rogers,"" along with his cohorts, was flying throughout the universe in a craft, large and well-equipped and -furnished, much like Kirk and Spock and the ""Star Wars"" denizens, everyone walking around freely as if they were in a fancy hotel suite. Yet even today, the ships and space stations remain cramped and less-than commodious.Along with ""science fiction'"" (and containing many occurrences patently impossible, but somehow credible), this film also has characteristic of the horror genre, ""Poltergeist-""type occurrences; also the good old-fashion ""noir"" flick of the 40's and 50's (the reason why Brian Donlevey died with a healthy estate). It also has pure mystery elements, along with those of sophisticated drama, the ""main character (however powerful and rich)"" reordering his priorities and finding what's really important in life. It also provided some ""road film"" scenes, and plenty of danger for the lead character.There probably are a few other categories, but these are sufficient to describe this outstanding picture, well-crafted, interesting, and one of those few capable of holding your interest throughout.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stylish but flawed,"Stylishly directed by David Fincher in a very convincing modern-day film noir mode. Plot is genuinely intriguing but takes a long time to gain any momentum at all. Ending is a real let-down particularly when an obvious window was there for a more intriguing and intelligent conclusion, although I suspect that popular tastes are the cause of this problem. Penn and Unger are good but Douglas as the lead character gives a rather lackluster performance that could easily have been put together from bytes from his other films.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Game was No Laughing Matter,"Yesterday I watched a movie that I hadn't seen in 19 years so I decided to watch another movie that I hadn't seen in about as long. Whereas the other movie was worse than I remembered, ""The Game"" was better than I remembered.Before the morbid movie ""Saw"" put chosen people through an orchestrated ""game"" of sorts there was ""The Game"". Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker out of San Francisco. He's arrogant, rude and cutthroat--many of the qualities needed to be a successful businessman--but he's also lonely. On his 48th birthday his brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), gave him a gift of a ""game"" set up by CRS (Consumer Recreation Services). The ""game"" was no game at all to Nicholas, it was real.I liked the fact they made Nicholas realistic. In other words, he wasn't a raging a-hole. They didn't make his character so over the top that you thoroughly hated him. He was a businessman that had standards. He wanted things done a certain way and he expected them done the way he wanted. He never made a scene to humiliate anyone or belittle anyone. He was subtle but his point was made. In that sense we weren't set up for some major conversion ala Scrooge.The game he got involved in was elaborate. Maybe that would be the only real knock against the movie: just how elaborate the game was. It involved dozens of participants, series of misdirection and even some near death moments. It was so elaborate it bordered on extreme.Besides that nuance I enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed it today just like I did, ahem... years ago.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bit of fun,"If you're like me...Go into this movie expecting a bit of fun and not too much more than that, hence my 6/10 rating. The movie starts well and creates a lot of intrigue to the possibilities of what ""The Game"" might be. Though the whole time I was wondering if it could live up to the hype - that would be what decides the fate of the movie, is it going to be an ever unravelling puzzle which never really gets solved?The puzzle will be solved, though it's certainly nonsensical and to be taken light heartedly. Don't worry about trying to take this movie too seriously, as you'll be disappointed with whether certain things are all that realistic. You have to get beyond that and imagine that it's plausible.If you like David Fincher, expect the usual suspense, mystery and thrill that surrounds his movies, but not to the same high class. That's down to the plot rather than any fault of Fincher's. I don't think the movie (written how it is) has as much potential as Se7en, Gone Girl, Fight Club, even though at the start you would maybe think he could be onto another real hit.Michael Douglas is well cast as the middle aged wealthy hotshot banker who goes through life without much spontaneity and fun, so his brother (Sean Penn) decides to get him involved in ""The Game"" to spice things up. Penn isn't in the film too much, so not necessarily one to watch just because you're a Penn fan, though the parts where we do see him, he's very typically emotionally Penn. That's a good standard as usual, but nothing new or lengthy here.What stops this movie being great? It's certainly not down to acting or direction, in my eyes just the over elaborate plot which could've done a couple of things differently, so that in the end it all made sense. It's the ""that could never happen"" factor which stops it being great. It was possible to keep the plot along the same lines, with the same outcomes, but with different details in between. They instead chose a route which was implausible. That was the downfall unfortunately.Still, I didn't mind enough to dislike it. I was especially intrigued at the start, and you do want to see where they go with the story. You want to find out what ""The Game"" is.It's not one that i'll be revisiting anytime soon, but i'm glad I gave it a go. Have fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Justifiable Homicide,"I watched this film with amazement throughout the whole thing. Excuse me, but who did the filmmakers market this to?

I honestly can't decide what takes the cake! But let me tell you this, this film will leave you on the edge of your seat and keep you guessing up until the ending of the film where the credits begin to play - no I'm not joking!Don't ""think"" about watching this film, take it from me, and WATCH IT!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
let's all play,"When ""The Game"" first came out in theaters, I didn't really know much about it, so when I went to see it, I was pleasantly surprised. Portraying San Francisco banker Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) getting involved in a ""game"" that invades his personal life, the movie keeps you guessing every minute. I can say with certainty that I couldn't have predicted anything that happened in the movie. And that ending was sure a shocker.One thing about the movie that really struck me was Sean Penn's performance. It had just been two years since he'd affirmed his presence on the silver screen with ""Dead Man Walking"", and he was now starring in this most perplexing film (around the same time, he also starred in the equally perplexing ""U Turn""). This all showed that he would soon have a solid filmography - not to mention become one of America's primary political activists.But the point is that you're sure to have a good time watching this movie. It affirms David Fincher as a great director (he was also behind ""Fight Club"" and ""Panic Room""), and makes me nostalgic for autumn, 1997, when we also had movies like ""In & Out"", ""LA Confidential"" and ""Good Will Hunting"". Very well done. Also starring Deborah Kara Unger, Armin Mueller-Stahl and James Rebhorn.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Underappreciated,"Released in 1997, just in between two of Fincher's master films, Se7en and Fight Club this movie never got the attention it truly deserved. Always overlooked by fans and critics, The Game stood in the shadow of Fincher's better films for too long, but it remained an absolute gem if you ask me.A very fast-paced mystery movie, that keeps you entertained with all the shocker reveals and your mind in doubt under every twist! Dissolved immensely into the film, you can't know for certain whether it's all a harmless prank, a psychotic episode, a fun game, or a criminal ripoff.

It's Completely Lacking In Credibility,"I like psychological suspense-thrillers. What makes them work really well is believability. No matter how outlandish the story may seem, there has to be at least a bit of your brain that's saying as you watch ""I could see that happening."" That's when you get drawn into the story. That's when suspense takes hold. That's when you begin to be able to feel the fear of the main characters. That's when a psychological suspense-thriller works really well. Unfortunately, ""The Game"" doesn't work really well. It doesn't do any of the above. It's simply not believable. Never once in the movie (or at least once we were introduced to the game that Nicholas Van Orten was playing) did I have the thought that ""I could see this happening."" Never. It was too outlandish. Think about it. In order for this game to work, pretty much the entire City of San Francisco would have had to have been onside. Van Orten could have done any number of things or (and here's the real problem) encountered any number of people who - not being in on the game - could have changed things completely. The game (to me at least) is unworkable; unplayable. Since that was my feeling right from the start, I didn't get pulled in by the story. I found it long and drawn out. The writers tried valiantly to keep me on my toes by throwing twists and turns and surprises - but I really didn't care, because I just didn't believe any of it. Too bad.Too bad, because the cast was good and solid. Michael Douglas was in character, playing a fairly stereotypical character for him, as Nicholas Van Orten, and Sean Penn did well as his little brother Conrad, who presented Nicholas with the game as a birthday gift. I liked Deborah Unger as the ""waitress"" Christine. Honestly? She's attractive, but not the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, but she had a chemistry with Douglas, and she did present a real aura of sexiness, even though that wasn't particularly what the character was about (the ""I'm not wearing any underwear"" comment notwithstanding!)The basic idea of a movie about a ""reality game"" (made in the era before ""reality TV"" became a staple) was interesting. If this had just been toned down a bit, and the scale of the game not been quite so large, it would have been more credible and therefore much more suspenseful and satisfying.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Fincher perfectly manipulates the audience and keeps his foot on the throttle once it gets going,"David Fincher taps into what Michael Douglas does best in playing ordinary men slowly disintegrating through circumstances beyond their control in a performance that is reminiscent of a cross between Wall Street (1987) and Falling Down (1993), all done with an Hitchcockian verve in this entertaining edge of the seat thriller.There is a lot to enjoy here if you are willing to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride as Douglas's character spirals deeper and deeper into a game of real life peril that takes him right out of his comfort zone. If such a game really did exist it's probably the sort of thing a rich brother would get his sibling, especially as boys like to play pranks on one another. Brother Sean Penn decides to give Douglas the ultimate gift for his birthday to stir things up in his life but this elaborate game takes things a little too far and plunges him into a seemingly life threatening nightmare.Fincher perfectly manipulates the audience with this one and keeps his foot on the throttle once it gets going as one thing after another drives the Douglas character literally to the edge.While The Game does stretch viewer loyalty rather thinly towards the climax you are so desperate to find a resolution after 2 hours of tension that you'll be willing to accept it's flaws and be glad to catch your breath.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An insult to the intelligence,"This movie was made not long after the movies ""The usual suspects"" and ""seven"" were made. Both of them had what is called a ""surprise ending"". I'd bet a year salary that ,after seeing the success of those films, some greedy producer told his stuff ""I want you to make me this kind of a movie!!"" so the writer first thoght of a surprising end and then had built a movie around it, I don't buy for a second all the other analysis of the movie about ""inner layers"" or some other crap. This movie was meant to make some money by having a surprise ending and that is all. Well, don't get me wrong I love those kind of movies but I hate when I'm presented with something so illogical and insulting to the intelligence. let me explain why: No one is that smart period. no one can predict what someone is gonna do so accurately, it is IMPOSSIBLE. Imagine a crime scene filled with potential clues, it might take a lot of time figuring out the relevant clues and figuring out who is the killer. Now suppose you know exactly who did it and why, so now (suppose you want to look smart) you know exactly what clues are relevant and how to build the chain of evidence that will lead you to the cuLprit. do that and all the other detectives will think you're the smartest man in the world - It is very easy to know what to do in retrospect. and that is exactly the error of the movie - the writer knew the ending and builT the entire movie around it ,because he knew the answer it is easy to reconstruct the questions! so it easy for him to forsee the hero's actions. but ,as I said, No one is smart enough in real life. You think that someone might be? well. for example, there is a famous problem in physics called the 3 body problem: you have 3 bodies revolving around each other and you have to know (knowing the start \ point) their position after an arbitrary time. the equations governing their movement aren't very complicated but even the most powerful supercomputers cannot do that in a reasonable time. only 3 bodies!!!And in the movie we have much much much more complicated thing -real people, the real world etc. so You're gonna tell me that a small group of actors can predict all what the hero would do in such accuracy? don't make me laugh.As i said this movie was made to make money by having a surprise ending and It has done so and let all laws of logic be gone to hell.this movie was awful and an utter insult to the intelligence of anyone with I.Q over 60.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The movie totally turned into a case of 'where does the game begin and where does it end?'. I really enjoyed trying to figure out what the game was, who was in it, and why the people at CRS were so relentless. Because if the people at CRS (spoiler, I suppose) were only trying to screw Nicholas Van Orton over, why didn't they just stop once they made him look crazy and got control of all aspects of his life?

"""Discovering the object of the game is the object of the game.""","I have seen this movie so many times since it came out, and it's probably my favorite film. I can't think of any other movie remotely similar to it; it's immensely original and creative. I cannot praise it enough.""The Game"" is about a man named Nicholas who, much like Scrooge from ""A Christmas Carol,"" has everything but is broken and unhappy because of his tragic past. His brother gives him a very unique present for his birthday - a gift card for a company named Consumer Recreation Services. All anyone will tell Nicholas is that this company sells some kind of ""game,"" an ""experience"" unlike no other. Once his game begins, the movie really takes off. Extremely bizarre events start occuring randomly around him, and he starts to question what is real and what is an illusion. To get any more into this would spoil it, but as one of the characters in the film says, ""First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.""I've read through a lot of the reviews and see that there are some people who are unsatisfied with the ending, stating that it didn't make any sense. I completely disagree. The thing about ""The Game"" is that you're not just watching a character going through the game, you're also participating in a bit of a game, yourself. Like the promotional poster for the film, the story is a jigsaw puzzle. The film feeds you these ""jigsaw pieces,"" clues to the meaning of the story. By the end of the story, those jigsaw pieces will come together and paint the full picture. However, in order to truly see that picture, you have to be paying attention and trying to put that puzzle together yourself, not just relying on the film to do it all for you. You have to put yourself into someone else's shoes completely, not just think, ""Well, that's not what I would do."" This is Nicholas' game, and it would be different for each one of us. The psychological depth and the twists are just brilliant.So, ""admit that it sounds intriguing"" and take the ride.

7 on a scale of 10,"As always, Michael Douglas is fantastic. If not for him, this preposterous movie would never have been made.I watched with the interest and intensity of an 8 on a scale of 10, but when it was over, I had to vote. It's kind of like eating something good (8), but the after taste is a 5. I mean you have to forget what it tasted like initially, because you are in the present - and sometimes the present tastes pretty bad. Thus a 7 on a scale of 10.My problem was that after it was all over and the mystery all solved (except for the blood on the back of Penn's jacket - what's that all about????) I had to just shake my head over and over and over and the only word that came to mind was preposterous, preposterous, preposterous.But, if you don't care or if you don't worry about that sort of thing or if you can hold your nose 5 seconds after the movie is over for at least as long as the after taste lingers, then you might really like this movie.As for me, I enjoyed the 2 hours, but I will not remember it fondly.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A game? I prefer Monopoly...,"All through the movie we have the ""edge of the seat"" suspense of ""is this for real or part of the game?"".

Interesting and strange thriller,"I remember sometime in the early 2000's I happened to see the latter half of this movie on tv and thought it was amazing. But I never saw the beginning until now. I still liked the movie now but I think it was even better when I started to watch it from the middle, having no clue about what's going on. That made it even more surprising.It's an interesting thriller where the main character's (Michael Douglas) life becomes a chaos because he can't anymore distinguish reality from a game he takes part in. The plot is quite crazy, and even if you try to understand it, it seems unrealistic and a bit ridiculous. But that doesn't matter because it's a thrilling ride with a feeling of mystery. And the ending is really good, so be sure to watch it all the way.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What an ending of a film.,"It is a very good film, with lots of twists and turns in the film, with and ending which has a big turn and then another, which I didn't see coming. I liked that each clue that he was given helped him, I just wished that there were more of them, as they were such a lovely key part of the movie. Also if the rest of the film was as great as the ending was, it would have been an even better film I believe. Plus the film's ending is almost like a Nolan ending, so if you like Christopher Nolan I would definitely recommend this film to you.

As intriguing as it is frustrating,"Michael Douglas plays a wealthy investment banker whose dreary, uneventful life is turned upside down when his brother invites him to try a newfound game organized by a mysterious company. What does the game entail? And has it even started yet? David Fincher's much discussed and relatively hailed mystery-thriller is as intriguing as it is frustrating and manipulative. We follow Douglas around the city of San Francisco in what feels like a real-world computer game where you never know what the rules are or who you can trust. Fincher aims for a captivating, luxurious atmosphere filled with paranoia, but the story's unruly downward spiral is an exertion which the wildly elaborate and overly clever ending cannot quite balance - even if it does pose some interesting questions about appreciating life and contemplating death.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Game mind games galore,Watched On the Line and I was properly informed that it was a cheap ripoff of the Game so I decided to see the David Fibcher move for myself only to discover they were right. Michael Douglas gave a stunning performance but why make him go through all that stress for his birthday. The audacity of the brother pulling this off making Douglas go through all that was just annoyingly insane. Well if that's how you want to impress your brother and fellow man then it's rather annoying. I got the hint that they wanted him to 'chill and be free' but sheer torture is painful them at the end Douglas talks to that woman and all goes well. Guess the writers didn't have a satisfying ending now did they. The Game is a psychological masterpiece that put a man to his wits for a cheap poke? Nah that's very annoying. On the Line tried to copy this but did a double twist which was way worse. The Game here was fine.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A Thrilling Tale, though it May Fall Flat,","The Game is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. It is a very thrilling movie as we see a man get involved with an organisation that he can not seem to get himself out of. It has all the elements you would expect from a David Fincher movie, his talent for telling a story and setting up a dark, eerie atmosphere is very evident here.The film did feel too muddled for its own good, there was a sense that they were making it confusing for its audience because they did not know where they were going with it. Rather than building up the exciting twists and turns they had planned well in advance, the script felt like the writers were making it all up as they went on.The ending is the major disappointment for me and makes the entire film as a whole feel very flawed. It is nowhere near as exciting as we would have anticipated, and I felt somewhat cheated on by this underwhelming finale.The film shows that a thriller will not work to full effect if we are following a protagonist who really knows nothing, and finds out very little as the plot progresses. It could have worked better as a puzzle solver, rather than scene after scene that raises more questions than it answers. Thrilling and entertaining, The Game certainly does not shine as much as some of Fincher's other work, nor is it as enjoyable as Michael Douglas' previous thrillers, but I would still say it is worth the watch if you are looking for a good Mystery, just do not go out of your way to see it.On his birthday, a wealthy businessman's brother gives him a present in which he becomes involved with the CRS, a mysterious organisation with unusual motives.Best Performance: Michael Douglas",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent,"The film is excellent and underrated. Of course, the film has great actors, but Sean Pean and Michael Douglas should be especially emphasized. The film is one of the greatest plot twists ever. Personally, one of the best films for me, the story is good, the actors are great, the director (GOAT) and everything is great. I would give this film a 10, but since the middle of this film is a bit boring and the beginning and end are great, I gave it an 8 because of that middle. David Fincher the GOAT director.

This is more than just a thriller!,"When I started watching the movie ""The Game"", I thought it would be another classic thriller in a series, but it turned out that it wasn't exactly what it seemed to me, but it was something more than a classic thriller.I will explain...The director of the film, David Fincher, made sure that every frame was tense, from the very beginning to the end. All this was supported by the excellent acting of Michael Douglas and other actors who made the film even more interesting to watch. The plot of the film is so simple, and despite that, the film itself was easy to watch, which I really liked. The director has managed to create such a good twisted plot from such a simple theme, which is hardly visible to you until you reach the climax of the film, that you are left speechless. And when you think it's over and when you're expecting the last shot, the director's crazy, extraordinary imagination surprises you once again. All in all, the film has something that other thrillers don't have. Although it may not be exactly for a nine or ten, it is definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Hey, I'll Give This a Try","A few weeks ago a former student brought three boxes of VHS tapes to my classroom. She knew I like that format for its sturdiness, and I depend on VCRs to record movies, transferring them to disk if a movie is a keeper.Most of the videos were films I already had or had already seen and didn't want, but I appreciated this young woman's thoughtfulness.With that said, I found David Fincher's The Game, a movie that interested me when it first came out 19 years ago. I've seen so many crappy or mediocre films lately that I was hoping for a gem hidden in the box.And I got one.The best things about this psychological thriller are that, although it often brushes up against the absurd, it never gets saturated with silliness, and Michael Douglas is both infuriating and sympathetic as a heartless and driven money-mover who, after being given a very unusual birthday gift by his ne'er-do-well brother, Sean Penn, finds that the gift keeps on giving. Or taking, in this case.For 128 minutes, I was able to jettison everything else, and become immersed in a story that was both fresh and fun. The Game is tightly plotted and well-acted, and only occasionally gets a bit boggy from aforementioned absurdities. Not enough to fuss about.I thought I might be in for something above average with Douglas' character being confronted with that I-hate-clowns clown in his driveway, followed by being talked to directly by Daniel Schorr on TV.It's a very trippy flick, with enough escapist power, twists and turns, and an understated moral to give an old movie-lover/movie- cynic a good solid entertainment.Fire up the VHS to DVD transfer software!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Puppet On A String,"Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy, and very unlikeable, businessman who has every material comfort and pleasure money can buy. So, his younger brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), gives Nicholas an unusual gift for his 48th birthday: an invitation to play an elaborate and mysterious ""game"", from a mysterious corporation called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS).It's an intriguing film concept; a cold-blooded corporate exec submits to a proposition that forces him to function as a puppet on a string. We can imagine all sorts of humiliating challenges that this reptilian man must confront, what great payback.Unfortunately, although it's a great concept, the story is awful. Nicholas' challenges are too physical to be believable. Most of the middle Act consists of repetitive encounters that cause Nicholas physical pain and/or major financial and logistical trouble. Over and over we see him confront ludicrous obstacles that are so contrived and improbable as to be silly. The problem here is that the script is written as a souped-up action movie, evidently to appeal to kids. The film presents all of this revved-up action well. But, given that Nicholas does not invoke the supernatural or super human skills, the film's plot is totally inconsistent with reality. Plot holes are everywhere.The film would have been far better with challenges that are more cerebral, more realistic. But, of course, that would have bored the intended audience. As is, ""The Game"" comes across as an animated cartoon, aimed at youngsters.The film's cinematography, acting, and production design are fine. I am disappointed that Michael Douglas would agree to play the lead role in a film wherein the story is so implausible, so ""cartoonish"".",,Anonymous,Mystery
Morality tale,"Nicholas Van Orton is a modern-day Scrooge: interested only in money, he overlooks the human side of things, firing people or getting them fired at the drop of a hat. Worse, he shuts out his loser of a brother, when he should be letting him in. Above all, he fails to understand that a birthday is supposed to be a special event, devoted to the celebration of one individual. (He has a back-story of course, which makes him more likeable.)And this birthday, despite Nick's hatred of fun, he's going to get a lesson in the meaning of life, or at least a very intense experience. Caught up in the smoke and mirrors of ""The Game"", he'll have the hardest time figuring out what's real and what's illusion, who around him is authentic and who an actor. We've seen a similar dystopian conspiracy world in films like ""The Matrix"", but there the individual was incidental to the conspiracy. Here, everything is organized to mystify one man (like in the 1960s series ""The Prisoner"") -- and an operation of this scale obviously costs a lot of money, so it's no surprise if Nicholas has to open his wallet at the end. Fortunately, he has everything it takes to control people and get out of a jam: a Swiss bank account, an heirloom watch and a gun.In the course of his journey through darkness, Nicholas will experience what it's like to wake up in an unpressed suit and rub shoulders with the poor. It would be wrong, though, to assume that this is like a chapter in the life of Buddha, teaching him a lesson about the misery of others: the people fired because of him turn out to be grateful! Instead, the moral of the story is: celebrate your birthday to the hilt. Be surrounded by crowds who are paid to clap for you, and you stand a chance of getting the girl no matter how bad you treat people!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Great, but could have been better","David Fincher is almost always reliable to deliver some good thrills. Se7en is probably the best thriller I've ever seen, Panic Room is pretty exciting and I've heard a lot of good things about Fight Club. However, this one stands out, at least from Panic Room and Se7en, since pretty much nothing in this movie is what it seems. It keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of the action scenes, and it keeps you wondering, up until the very last minute, what the hell is going on. Then you find out. I'm not saying the ending was downright bad, but it could definitely have used some improvement. It could have been worse, but it could also have been so much better. The end just seems to ruin a lot of the buildup of the rest of the film. Anyway, the plot is very good, a man who has everything, but isn't completely satisfied with his life, gets a chance to have some ""fun"". He takes it, and his life is changed forever. The acting is all good. The characters are well-written and credible. Actually, everything but the ending is top notch. The ending is the one reason that this movie doesn't get, at least, a 9. It just ruins so much of the movie, especially because the moment the definite end of the movie is reached, it feels empty. Up until that moment, you feel like you were watching a work of art, and then just before it ends in the same way that the rest of it has been, it cuts to some lame excuse for everything that happened in the movie up to that point, rather than a good explanation. I really wish they had made the ending better. Overall, a pretty good thriller, that could have been a masterpiece. I recommend this to fans of Fincher's other work, and fans of psychological thrillers altogether. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best performances of Michael Douglas,"The beginning of the ""The game"" is very stong. We see Michael Douglas as the self righteous, grumpy, egocentric (in short nasty) rich businessman Nicholas van Orton. Nobody likes this guy and that becomes extremely clear when he celebrates his 48th birthday all on his own in his big house watching CNN and eating a hamburger.A day later he gets a present from his brother. It is a ticket to a tailor made game. From then on the film tells the biblical story of Job, learning a rich man humility (apart from the fact that Job was rich but good from the beginning). The life of the control freak Van Orton is turned upside down and he seems to lose all his money. It is no coincidence that on the film poster his face disintegrates in the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.Director Fincher tells the Job story in a spectacular way. The fact that a crime element or a crime possibility is always lurking on the background maintains the tension. As a viewer you forget that the story is highly unprobable. The organisation of the game seems capable of 100% predicting the reactions of Van Orton. It almost seems like the detective Dupin in the Edgar Allan Poe story ""The murders in the Rue Morgue"".",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best films of 1997. Mind thrilling with fun entertainment and suspense!,"Of all the films I saw in the year 1997, this ""The Game"" with Michael Douglas has to be one of the best. Because really you don't see any complex plot twist, and the the film is thrilling and suspenseful with a hard and direct pressed acting performance from Douglas. I really too liked the story and thrilling mood from director David Fincher. You have Michael Douglas as millionaire businessman financier Nicholas Van Orton who's very successful yet he's lonely and carries a very uptight personality while living in his San Francisco mansion. So one day younger brother the more liberal and free spirited Conrad(Sean Penn) gives Nicholas a birthday present a gift card from a corporate company called consumer recreation services(CRS) for as Conrad says the experience and pleasure of a lifetime that this game will add all the fun and entertainment to your life that's missing. So Nicholas tries the service out, and one by one his life starts to get creepy, unpredictable, and very strange in very unusual ways. Many of the moments and scenes are memorable from his talking TV developing it's own voice, the clown left in front of his home entrance, to his meeting of a sexy blonde waitress Christine(Deborah Kara Unger)and most of all his taxi cab one night takes a plunge off the golden gate bridge! This nonsense starts to drive him crazy as the worry starts to make him wonder if he will end up like his father and meet a tragic end the past haunts him so much. Only to find out how it ends is strange and simple it really surprises the viewer the first time they watch. Overall really a fine done film with good acting from Douglas and the story was a neat concept from Fincher with thrills and fun suspense and in it's day this film might have been a glimpse into the future form of identity theft. Anyway ""The Game"" still entertains and it's clearly one of 1997's best.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Fincher fan or not- see this movie,"Definitely worth a rent AT LEAST. Fincher's third movie stars Michael Douglas as the rich, cold and alone Nicholas Van Orton. His brother, Sean Penn, gets him a reality-life game from a company who specializes in creating different life games for different people based on their lives, history, likes and dislikes, etc. The object of the game: to figuare out what the object of the game is. Orton is very reluctant about the game, however you can tell he secretly is very intrigued by the idea. As you may guess and without revealing too much- things get out of hand very quickly and things are not what the seem. Michael Douglas is at the top of his game as well (pun intended). Personally, I find this to be one of his best movies he's ever made. All in all, this one is a must for thriller fans, Fincher fans, Douglas fans, and just about everyone else too. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The writing, the atmosphere, the dialogue, the score, the cinematography and the brilliant performances are as close to perfection as you can get. One of the complaints I've heard about The Game is that the movie isn't realistic and goes too far. Well, today we have technology that is far more impressive than anything seen in The Game. I came to realize long ago that the world is usually a lot more complex than we realize and with money and an endless amount of resources you can get some pretty amazing things done. That being said, the goal of the movie was never to be realistic. It was rather to create an exciting ride into the realm of cinematic magic, a world where reality and fiction dance together as elegantly as possible.

Well what else would expect from the man who gave us Fight Club and Se7en?,"I really had not the slightest clue what I purchased when I bought myself a copy of the game. From the trailer the film looked like it was worth a look and it seemed as if I was also invented to go along for the ride when I picked it up. I would rather not discuss the plot with anyone because this movie is definitely an experience which some could argue come close to what the late Alferd Hitchcock would bring to us , all I can say that after watching you might love it loathe one thing is for certain and that is that won't ever be bored during the course of this journey. As good as Sean Penn is , this was without a shout of a doubt Micheal Douglas's movie , from the begin he just lures you in with his unique form of acting to the point where one actually begins to sympathises with him. There are classic Dave Fincher trademarks whether it be deliberately keeping things dark with plenty of twists and turns and not to mention a tight script. My only complaint was that the movie might just drag a little in places but having said that it never wonders far at all and the action and suspense is great.

"An intelligent,  gripping drama, filmed with crisp efficiency","A very solid, thoughtful and stylish outing from made with great precision that is becoming a hallmark of David Fincher. His interest in 'films that scar' continues, and while this film doesn't top quite the heights of the remarkable Se7en, it is still a very worthy achievement, thanks to a trenchant yet subtle performance from Michael Douglas. The script is solid, but it is really the effective partnership between Douglas and Fincher, as well as great supporting acting turns from Sean Penn, James Rebhorn and Debra Kara Unger, which really helps ground this slow burning but always engrossing psychological thriller. You have to pay attention, but as the plot twists and turns it does work its way to a satisfying if surprisingly climax (especially for a director of Fincher's background) you'll enjoy the way that Douglas's Nicholas Van Orton character is stripped of his layers of reserve and control as the character is cleverly placed in one crisis after another.Technical credits are as usual very polished – production design and Haris Savidies's photography stand out, but its Howard Shore's minimalist score that really enhances the mood of the film brilliantly. While the score has some of the dark overtones of Se7en, it is not as dark as that movie but still works very well to make the viewer fell unsettled – in particular the use of a sole piano is extremely effective in certain scenes. To cap it all it is slickly edited and comes together with a crisp efficiency. Overall another film that firmly cements David Fincher's reputation as an extremely talented and uncompromising film-maker.",,Anonymous,Mystery

I really want to rate this movie higher,"The acting is great -- Douglas, especially, was amazing, and the action gradually, then frantically, picked up the pace to make this a true thriller. The premise was interesting, even though you could see both major twists coming a mile away (partly a function, sadly, of knowing that few movies would have the huevos to end this movie ten minutes earlier than it did end.) It had plenty going for it except......I haven't read any other reviews here, but I suspect my criticism can be found in many of them: the movie asks too much in terms of suspension of belief. Some of the events were guided. I get that. But there were so many possible ways things could go completely wrong, and all the personality tests in the world wouldn't be able to predict how a man will react to serious danger and stress for what I can only assume was the first time in his life. The extent of control needed to pull this off would require resources and (wo)manpower and contingency planning to put a serious dent into Nicholas' own $600 million dollar fortune. They couldn't just plan for a straightforward trip and have alternate plans on paper. They would have to allocate the same amount of time, money and resources to every possible contingency because an alternate plan is just a piece of paper if you don't actually have the resources in place to execute it if it becomes necessary. And this is the generous assessment of the suspension of disbelief issue. The harsher one is that they literally couldn't possible control the chaos enough to make the game feasible, let alone safe. All it takes is Douglas deciding to run in front of a car in panic or despair, or grabbing a random knife somewhere and slitting somebody's throat or deciding to board the wrong transportation in Mexico or throwing a certain blonde of the wrong side of the roof for things to go very wrong. I just couldn't buy that any organization could have that much power and control. We can't even get the government to pull off anything perfectly (people forget, for instance, that the carefully-planned and executed killing of Osama by the U.S. government still resulted in a crashed helicopter) and the government has more resources than any novelty company.A couple other issues -- the organization was still breaking laws. Doing questionable things to a guy who signed a release? Sure, fine. Impersonating a police officer, reckless driving/endangerment, intercepting electronic communications? Transporting someone illegally over national borders? Felonies, and no release in the world will change that. And, in my personal opinion, Nicholas' rapid turnaround and ability to accept everything in good humor at the end just...seemed unlikely, especially for a high-strung man like Nicholas. Eventually coming to term with it, I can buy. Just not a 15 second transformation into a jolly good fellow. It's the most supremely optimistic Hollywood idea of how a person would react to a given situation I've seen in a good long while.But, yeah, it was a fun watch anyway. I just can't gloss over the suspension of disbelief issue to rate the movie higher.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

And that will make life very difficult for Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas). a successful businessman who is always in control. Van Orton lives a well-ordered life - until an unexpected birthday gift from his brother (Sean Penn) destroys it all. Van Orton has been enrolled in a game - ""a profound life experience"" - that begins quietly enough but soon erupts in a rush of devastating and bizarre events. Like it or not, he must either win the game or lose control of everything in his life.The movie is a mystery about a game from a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) it is a game like a vacation for holidays, just the vacation comes to you. This is a birthday gift from Connie (Sean Penn) to his brother Nicholas (Michael Douglas). When the game starts you keep thinking this is for real and people are really trying to kill Nicholas to get his money. First they screwed up his brother and now they want to screw him over.This is very, very well directed thriller and Michael Douglas best performance ever. I found the ending to be brilliant and makes sense. Deborah Kara Unger was extremely gorgeous and very hot sexy babe! I was even in love with her after seeing her in this movie. The scene in which protagonist Van Orton finds a life-size clown doll in his driveway was ranked #44 on Bravo's list of The 100 Scariest Movie Moments.For a David Fincher fan like myself, there are movies that I actually like they are: Se7en, Zodiac and of course Panic Room (2002) this was the film I went to see it in the movie theater in June 2002, when it was by us released in Slovenia it was actually the first Jodie Foster film I saw in a movie theater. But The Game will always be my favorite David Fincher film and Michael Douglas's third favorite film. I also do think this movie is very underrated and some people don't like it. Well I don't like Fight Club and I am probably the only one , but The Game I love to death. I heard years ago that Michael Douglas had a fun making this film with David Fincher and he would love to do another thriller with Fincher again, if Fincher would offer him another movie role.My favorite scene in the film is with the taxi cab when the taxi driver leaves him alone the car and the car drives on the pier in the water and Nicholas open's the window with that hook he received for the game package. I love when operatives of CRS are using suppressed Heckler & Koch MP5K's automatic machine gun to shoot the apartment of Christine (Deborah Kara Unger) and opens fire on Nicholas. Nicholas leaps off the skyscraper and crashes through a glass ceiling, but he lands safely in an airbag. There he finds his family and friends awaiting his arrival and The Game is revealed to have just been a game. The accounts have not been drained, the gun was replaced with one firing blanks, and his brother is alive.I am giving this film a perfect 10 out of 10 which I do believe is a classic David Fincher's underrated psychological best mystery thriller. Mine favorite Michael Douglas film of all time I love it!The Game is a 1997 American mystery thriller film directed by David Fincher, starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn, and produced by Propaganda Films and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. It tells the story of a wealthy investment banker who is given a mysterious gift: participation in a game that integrates in strange ways with his everyday life. As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio Studio: PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, Universal Studios Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger, Peter Donat, Carroll Baker, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Anna Katarina, Charles Martinet Director: David Fincher Producers: Steve Golin, Ceán Chaffin Screenplay: John Brancato and Michael Ferris Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hr. 9 Mins.

Great 90s paranoid thriller,"The Game is the kind of paranoid 90s thriller they don't make anymore, and probably couldn't make anymore. This genre is always at its best when letting the chaos reign since the answers rarely live up to their own expectations and The Game really excels here because it waits until the last possible minute to reveal them.Michael Douglas is a bona-fide movie star and roles like these remind you why. His character starts off so unlikeable and it's all down to Douglas's charm to make you root for him as things only get worse. It's also just really cool to see him share scenes with Sean Penn, who's a pretty solid likeness for his brother.David Fincher lends his bleak, cynical touch to create the best modern day retelling of A Christmas Carol. Aesthetically it's very recognisably him and the soundtrack uses White Rabbit to great effect. Howard Shore's score isn't always present but when it is there it can build a sense of paranoia with just a few notes.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Loved it!,"This is the sort of film that appeals to me a great deal. The plot reminds me a bit of Shutter Island - the subjects of these movies are completely different, but the similarity is that they twist and turn, and repeatedly turn the world on its head, to keep you guessing and make you doubt what in the movie is real. This film seemed to promise that from the description.And my goodness, did it deliver. I watched it in two chunks, and had to try REALLY hard not to look up what was coming next. It was massively gripping and kept me wanting to watch to find out what was happening.Michael Douglas does put in a solid performance here. He convincingly carries off the cold, and always-in-control lead character. You can see that he is very used to getting his own way, very used to being in control and in environments he is comfortable in, and how he gradually starts to lose his cool as he finds that control being taken away with nothing he can do about it. Later on, as he is reduced to a very pitiful state, and again it's carried off well, as a man coming to terms with what he has lost.The ending has apparently gotten some stick, but I actually enjoyed it. I must admit, I didn't guess it at all. Quite often these sorts of movies seem to end either badly, or in a sort of ""it was all a dream"" kind of way, but this one took its own route. I thought it pulled it off well, and it kept me guessing!My only real gripes were that there is a backstory about the lead character's father, but it's hardly explored and mostly mentioned but then discarded again. I'm not sure it added much. Also, as well as Michael Douglas, pretty much everyone in this gave a really good performance. I just felt that Sean Penn was a bit wasted. He turned in a good show as well but was hardly in it.If mysteries/conspiracies are your thing and you don't like predictability, this should definitely be your thing.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A stylish thriller that has a stamp of authority of Fincher,"The game is a stylish thriller based on a mysterious game played by younger brother Sean Penn on the lead and elder brother Michael Douglas. Douglas is in top form and this was at the end of his run as leading man as the late 90s dawned but the film is a David Fincher signature. The cinematography, stylish narrative and Fincher's crisp direction make this a winner. Although there are certain plotholes-and they emerge the more you think of the film- this film is a ride you won't regret watching.",,Anonymous,Mystery

The Game is Fun but it Isn't Fincher's Best,"The psychological thriller The Game is directed by David Fincher and stars Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, and Deborah Kara Unger. The film takes place in modern day San Francisco.Nicholas Van Orten (Douglas) is a very successful business man who lives alone and is very depressed. He used to be married and does not have a very close relationship with his brother, Conrad (Penn). On Nicholas's birthday he remembers how his father killed himself when he turned forty eight. But on Nicholas's birthday his brother gives him a gift that is from a company known as Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). What this company provides is a game that will control your life and promises a thrilling experience that you've never felt before. But it gets a little bit too thrilling...John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris wrote the screenplay for this psychological thriller, and it was a little bit too outrageous. It still is a very fun and entertaining ride but it requires you to not think too deeply about what the company needs to be doing for all of this to be happening. I will not go over all the ridiculous things that happen that make this film illogical because there are too many to count, but like I said if you forget about them it is a fun film. Also, this film is purely plot driven, the characters are very one dimensional. In all psychological thrillers there is some sort of twist and in this one there are many as well and they are satisfying, especially the final one.David Fincher is one of the biggest directors of today but this film was only his third feature and it did not have as much intensity and grittiness as his previous film Se7en. None of the shots in this film were all that impressive, but the sequencing of the shots kept me fascinated the whole way through the film. Fincher grew much as a director since this film and I would even claim that he is one of the best of his generation. But this film is not the reason why he is considered that at all, he became a cult favorite from Se7en and Fight Club then went on to start making more wide spread audience films like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and the recent The Social Network. His film repertoire is very impressive and it is enjoyable to see one of his early works such as this film and see how he has grown from it.Michael Douglas plays the lead of Nicholas Van Orten and even though the character is one dimensional he embodies the role quite well. He sort of plays a sad Gordon Gekko but does not have the great lines that Gekko had. He was very believable in the role but again this is not something that he will be remembered for when talking about why Michael Douglas is a very successful actor.Sean Penn does not have a major part in this film but he is still in it for a little bit as Nicholas's brother Conrad. When Nicholas and Conrad are running from the CRS and Conrad has sort of a paranoid nervous breakdown Penn is quite good, even though it is nothing compared to the many brilliant performances of his career. When I think Sean Penn I think Milk, Mystic River, and his comedic performance in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, not this film even though he is good, like Douglas.Deborah Kara Unger plays a waitress named Christine that Nicholas drags into his game. As the film goes on it is hard to determine if she is trying to help Nicholas or if she is working with the CRS. Her performance is alright, but nothing really memorable. I can't even cite a scene in the movie where she was good, it was just her character that was interesting.Overall I give this film a 6/10, because it is a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the dramatic finale. None of the qualities of the film are great, but they are all decent. I would recommend this to fans of Fincher, psychological thrillers, or I guess dark films with a twist.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A solidly entertaining mystery,"The Game is a solid mystery film that is perhaps let down slightly by a lacklustre final act that doesn't really bring things to a satisfying conclusion.The premise is brilliant, and is for the most part very well explored.

There are some good turns from the supporting cast too.As you'd expect from Fincher, the film is directed very well, and it feels slick and captures the atmosphere very well, even if certain elements do feel a tad dated.If you enjoy unique mystery films then this will certainly be up your street, even if the end does feel a little rushed and poorly executed.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Game over,"What really sets ""The Game"" apart is the metaphysical undercurrent. As a mystery action-thriller, it's great, full of plot-twists and tension. As the game that central-character, Nicholas Van Orton, was offered unfolds, and prank after elaborate prank turns to deadly ambiguous reality, Nicholas loses control of his life but also finds himself as the traveler in a Danteesque hell.The metaphysical meaning is this: the whole experience works as some sort of purgatory for Nicholas, who gets a chance to redeem himself of his sins (him being a ruthless capitalist businessman and alienated from pretty much everyone around him). At the start of the game, the mysterious organization company CRS (a sort of god, though in the end guided by the mere mortal players' wishes) evaluates Nicholas and his abilities, so that it organizes the perfect experience for him. At the apex of the game, and when Nicholas loses his money, he is being left for dead in a cemetery in Mexico. He metaphorically dies and is reborn a changed man.The director, David Fincher (of ""Seven"" and ""Fight-Club"" fame) obviously had a ball filming this.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could Anyone Play it?,"Like most David Fincher movies, The Game has style and tension to spare. The problem I had with it was that it lay in the middle zone of fantasy; that is, it introduced elements of high fantasy into a low fantasy world. This odd combination prevented this viewer from achieving the needed level of suspension of disbelief. The movie starts with an excellent premise, but the storyline becomes increasingly implausible. Only a puppet could have been at all the right places at the right times, as Mike Douglas's character was. Problem is that this character has an Alpha Dog personality and could never have been manipulated in this way. Beyonf that, many elements of the game were so risky that it is unlikely the player would have lived through them.Basically, what The Game plays on is the wide-spread belief and/or superstition that there is one or more highly organized group of people in this world that could take total control of your life.

Hollywoood-style entertainment at its best,"Nicholas Van Orten is a billionaire who has forgotten how to enjoy himself, and how to connect with anyone else. An ex-wife with whom he has little or no contact, a younger prodigal brother, and memories of a father who took his own life are the only human points of contact in his orbit. Pretty poor fare, and his plight is hardly going to top anyone's sympathy list.Fincher gives the whole thing high production values and a sinister sheen, adding pace and intrigue throughout. He makes excellent use of shadows and light, casting Van Orton's home is a particularly frosty hue. The story moves along briskly and economically, Van Orten fighting to retain control (his biggest fear being to lose control) of a situation that escalates rapidly in a series of adrenaline rushes. The sleek cars, expensive suits and chrome office buildings give way to Mexican dirt and dust and a bus ride with chickens. And that is the game just starting.Michael Douglas may lack range, but he can match any actor alive in the sneering stakes. Sean Penn is a nice counterpoint, rash and unruly but somehow charming with it.This isn't a film with a message (except for the inevitable thinly-disguised morality tale element Hollywood so often insists on), and you probably won't watch it twice. But for slick, high paced entertainment that keeps you guessing till the end, this is a great one-off film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Silly,"If you're willing to REALLY suspend your disbelief, then this is quite an entertaining film. But some parts are simply impossible such as the newcaster who speaks to him live through the television. That was just plain daft.At the end I was surprised at how humbly Douglas's character took it. It would have been much better if he had said: ""Oh yeah, it was really funny taking away my dignity like that"", then pulled out a loaded uzi and pumped them all full of lead. That would've been more realistic. Think about it - the man would've been outraged.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Great idea doesn't make a great movie,"David Fincher has proved that given a taut script, he will turn it into a great movie. Seven proved this and, to a lesser extent, David Koepp's Panic Room. Two of his movies, Fight Club and, this, The Game, prove that he can't quite turn a great idea into a great movie.The premise of The Game is fine: a mischievous brother of a bored businessman finds a company that offers the customer a roller-coaster ride of an experience...but in the real-world rather than in a theme park. The brother buys him the ""ride"" as a birthday present.The movie does reach a natural conclusion, but it has too much implausibility to get there. It seems as if the script was tweaked at the last moment to either ratchet up the excitement or to simply get the audience to ask themselves, ""how will our hero get himself out of this now?"". In the end, the audience will probably feel cheated by the answer. Perhaps if it didn't quite take itself so seriously, then I might have let it get away with it a bit.Michael Douglas is most certainly not extending his acting talent here. He plays the man-in-peril so well now and, as he gets to play it so seriously (and leave his pants on), you wonder if working with Fincher was the real reason he got involved with this. Still, you can't help think that Douglas was left scratching his head at the whole thing.Sean Penn is criminally underused as Douglas' brother. Penn plays his part so less straight-faced than Douglas that you almost expect him to give you a knowing wink. Perhaps Penn hoped that the rest of the cast and crew would treat it the same way as he obviously did.The Game, though, is an extremely well-made film. Fincher manages to incorporate some ingenuity (the clever car-into-the-water sequence) and craftsmanship to the proceedings. Undoubtedly, Fincher will make some great films in his career, but let's hope he picks his scripts carefully.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

American Lamo,"Nicholas Van Orton has everything - health, wealth, a nice house, and a general satisfaction with life. Life hasn't been easy for Nicholas - his father committed suicide and his wife left him, but he manages to get through smoothly. Smoothly until his eccentric brother comes to town and gives him an unusual birthday present - a ticket to a game. Now, whether Nicholas wants to be involved or not is irrelevant, because the game is already playing him...This film draws a strange parallel to Bret Easton Ellis's novel ""American Psycho"" and also the film version which came out in 2000. Ellis told the story of a man who has everything and wants more and more to the point of obsession. ""The Game"" tells the story of a man who has everything, but frankly doesn't give a damn. Work is work, who cares. Nicholas Van Orton goes through the motions in way much like the notorious Patrick Bateman - up in the morning promptly, off to work, meeting, gym, lunch, phone calls, drive home, dinner, etc... Like a robot on autopilot. Nicholas Van Orton is annoyed by the slightest deviation from his finely tuned routine so the viewer can really see how much ""the Game"" is a hell for him.Cleverly devised and continuously diverting until the end, the story is a brilliant and though provoking look at the worth of endless wealth. You can't do everything like Bateman tries, but you also can't do nothing like Van Orton tries. You have to do something. So why don't you?

"""The Game"" is only for our amusement, the purest of thrillers","The mere title ""The Game"" suggests a sort of fabrication for our entertainment, and that is precisely what this film does. From the first cue to the final fade out, ""The Game"" is created for the sole purpose of giving its plot-sniffing audience something to mull over and over again amidst a series of 180-degree twists and turns. It is the very pinpoint definition of the thriller genre. Other films mix thriller with drama or action/adventure, but ""The Game"" provides neither of these to any real extent and instead opts to be the finest example of exploiting an audience's love for the guessing game.""The Game"" is entertaining. Michael Douglas gets all dressed up for us Gordon Gekko style again and tries to unravel a dangerous real life mystery that envelops him after agreeing to an unusual birthday present from his brother (Sean Penn). From the moment we hear about the game we're completely hooked on trying to figure out what it is. It's a film that knows it has us right in its grasp the entire time and it fully exploits this fact -- we will not stop watching until we have the answers.The irony here is that this game is created for the person, in this case Douglas' character, and for the audience, this movie is tailored much the same way. That might seem clever, but unless the biggest ""try to figure it out"" puzzle is all you hope for in film -- no serious character development, resolved subplots, flawless logic -- then truth is ""The Game"" is a bit insulting.Writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris show a serious lack of respect for their audience. Sure, some people who watch this movie will forgive their sins because excessive plot twists excite them more than anything in cinema, but many watchers will feel insulted. Without getting into spoiler detail, ""The Game"" is riddled with plot holes and begs of you to suspend your disbelief out of sheer desire to figure out what's going on.

The lemon-twist ending was straight from Hollywood 101 and was probably recycled from a poorly written Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode.

"Thrilled, Enraged, Happy (sorta, or maybe just... MIND BLOWN)","From what I had read I was expecting from the beginning of the movie a twist ending but ,it has offered me so much more than that, I would call it a double twist kind of movie.It is a psychological movie that really kept me in suspense until the end.During this very elaborate plot I went through different emotional states from confusion to understanding, rage and finally shock. This movie made me think I that I really understood the story, coming to the same conclusion as the waitress told the main character and I could only think of a very weird, open ending. The other characters beside the main one, were very little presented leaving me with a sense of mystery. I think even if you put the puzzle pieces together it is hard to get to the real conclusion, because a lot of the pieces are missing or they don't make any sense. Douglas portrays extremely well the character's various emotions and he really got me sad and enraged, seeking justice for what he went through. It is a psychological movie that really kept me in suspense until the end OVERALL I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE with a MIND BLOWING ENDING!!! I will not go into more details just...

"Boring, uninvolving, silly and pointless. Need I go on?","'The Game' is yet another stinker from one of the most overrated film makers in Hollywood today, David Fincher. I could forgive the innumerable plot holes and general dumbness of this alleged thriller if I could actually feel some interest in pompous businessman Nicholas Van Orton's (a particularly dull performance from Michael Douglas) fate. And I could overlook Fincher's time wasting pretensions if it actually succeeded as a Hitchcockian man-on-the-run roller coaster ala 'The 39 Steps' or 'North By Northwest', but this overblown rubbish is such a chore to sit through that you'll breathe a sigh of relief when it finally ends. After that you'll ask yourself what the point of it all was. And you know what? There isn't one. Wanna absolutely waste two hours of your life?

"Douglas and Fincher make a Dark, Mysterious Film","In a dark, dangerous San Francisco lives Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas), a very rich businessman and a total loner. He doesn't come across as pathetic, but as rather as stern and cold, and blatantly unhappy despite the lap of luxury in which he lives. Sensing Nicholas' unhappiness, Nicholas' wild and über ostentatious brother Conrad (Sean Penn) appears and presents Nicholas a birthday gift, a gift that is sure to add some excitement to Nicholas life, and lift him out of the depressive fog that he carries around everywhere.Along the way we learn some little bits of information about Nicholas' life, but not much, which is nice because his past doesn't really seem to matter anyway. Fincher takes the character and forces him to deal strictly with the present time. All past regrets, misdeeds, and sins fall away when you are literally fighting for your life.Conrad's gift is a game. A set of real life, role-playing scenarios designed and executed by a company alleged called CRS. We don't know what CRS is, and neither does Nicholas, so when bizarre happenings start to occur, such as the nightly news anchor breaking character and speaking directly to Nicholas in his living room, Nicholas cannot tell what is really happening. Is this part of the game? Or am I hallucinating? Soon the puppet masters at CRS crank up the intensity of the events. There are numerous attempts on Nicholas' life. At one point he wakes up in Mexico after having been buried alive in an underground tomb. The occurrences are so extreme, that as an audience, we are just as confused as Nicholas. It is real? Or is it a game? It is impossible to tell, and this is what makes this film so much fun to watch.The world that CRS tailors to its clients is very cool and well put together. Even though Nicholas is told distinctly that the CRS game will begin, and it is not until after he is told this that strange and dangerous things start to happen, we are still unsure if it's game or reality. Fincher is essentially blurring our understanding of the common philosophical conventions of cause and effect.The Game is a good thriller, and an entertaining watch. The production value of the film is excellent. It projects on screen in dark, shadowy tones, mixed with diverse textures setting one scene to next to a another composed completely different. The film is full of interesting settings from Nicholas' mansion, to a Mexican border town, to meetings in coffee shops, to cabins in the woods, but despite the actual events taking place being very entertaining to watch, the film never really establishes what truth it is trying to convey. The ending is disappointing. We are not left with any kind of substantial meaning.The CRS experience is meant to be a massive, over-the-top shock to the nervous system. This shock forces one, Nicholas in this case, to decide whether he wants to fight to stay alive, or let go and die. Maybe we are supposed to take the hint and choose to live now, even though we don't have CRS to break us out of our depression and lethargy, as individuals, or as a whole society. But this might be pushing the limits of interpretation. Despite the absence of the deeper themes, such as investigating the pointlessness of existence as in Fight Club, or the proving the worthlessness of humanity as in Seven, The Game is still great watch. Once the film ends, it doesn't linger for days in the front of your mind like the best thrillers, but while your watching it you'll be on the edge of your seat, never knowing what it going to happen next.Get more at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A must for Hitchcock students,"The Game is a non-stop homage to Hitchcock, from the never-quite-modern San Francisco milieu to the symbolic doors, windows, mirrors, stairs, glass shards, blood, to the clueless man on the run from inexplicable evil, to fake falls off very high places to lifeless mannequins propped up in chairs.Check the suggestive sign that lights up behind Michael Douglas as he moves to look down a subway staircase (which is really stairs from a bridge to the street) with a phone (and weird derelict) at the bottom; then a split edit with phone ring audio leading that cuts to Douglas answering a quite different phone. Consider the lyrics of the Jefferson Airplane/Grace Slick ""White Rabbit,"" which appears in the film and is reprised in its entirety over the end credits.Like every Hitchcock movie, The Game is, itself, a game: thoroughly engrossing when you're playing it, but obviously preposterous when you think about it five minutes later. If playing the game of The Game(and spotting all the Hitchcock tropes) is for you, you'll have a blast. If you're irritated by the wildly implausible (and even downright impossible), go watch a documentary.If you fall in between, as I did, give in to the chase (BTW, the R rating must be solely for some F-- words: there's no explicit sex or violence) and enjoy the show.

Terrible movie,"I am a long time IMDb lurker, first time commenter. Allow me to start with my conclusion: I was flat out offended by this movie's supposition that I would be too blinded by senseless suspense to apply logic or rationality. This movie is simply incoherent and somehow tries to have profound meaning.The Game is essentially a modern adaptation of the Ebenezer Scrooge story. The only notable difference being that The Game makes far less sense than the original (despite the fact that said original involves ghosts embodying the living dead and bilateral time travel). The viewer is to believe the protagonist is lead via elaborate scheming to have a life changing insight. Unfortunately for the scriptwriters, this scheming involves innumerable logical paradoxes. Any attempt to compile these retardations here would result in my death (likely by suicide).

More twists and turns than a rollercoaster.,"The Game is not a movie that at first glance would appear to be anything special, yet after the first five minutes you are hooked.David Fincher is fast becoming one of my favourite directors. His ability to execute fast paced thriller/ film noir is bordering on perfect. His style here clearly shows through and adds great depth to the dark and mysterious storyline. Along with an outstanding performance from Michael Douglas, 'The Game' takes you in more directions than a London cabbie.Douglas (Nick Van Orton) is becoming increasingly depressed with his life, his rich lifestyle not making up for the loss of his father when he was at a young age. His younger brother Conrad tries to cheer him up by giving him a very mysterious birthday gift. He involves him in a mysterious game in which Douglas plays out in his ordinary life. Things become very mysterious and things aren't as they first seem.The plot (if a little far-fetched at times) is gripping and what can only be described as 'pure film'.

"""Discovering the object of the game *is* the object of the game.""","I was a little disappointed by ""The Game"". Given the word of mouth and ratings, I expected so much from this film, I expected a particular film, determined and able to upset you. Instead I found only a nice, slightly boring film with too confusing traits in my opinion. It is obvious that it is the first viewing and usually for films of this kind you need more visions to better understand what the film is about, but here I think in case the vote will not rise too much. "" The Game"" has a very clear message: it's important to understand what really matters in life. In fact, the film is about Nicholas Van Orton, a middle-aged business millionaire who has everything but morally has nothing and lives a pretty depressing life. For this reason, on his 48th birthday, his brother Conrad offers him a flyer to participate in a game, but it will prove more than a game for him. This game will lead him to live intense adventures and choices, especially on trust. Fincher with this film tries to bring something new to the genre, in my opinion he succeeds, be clear, but in my opinion it has real potential, as for example with ""Se7en"", an absolute masterpiece. The performances of the actors were fundamental and I think that Fincher has very much focused on this precisely for this reason, for a film like this we needed actors who knew how to be in line with the film. What struck me the most was the now well-established Sean Penn, but also Michael Douglas did a great job. James Rebhorn and Deborah Kara Unger are other important names in this film. The other actors leave a bit to be desired. The film is well written because there are so many references throughout the film, so many details that try to lead you to the conclusion. The ending is perfect, with a great tension. Anyway, in conclusion, The Game is a film that I would see again, but it certainly does not fall among the films that I will never forget..

Enthralling until its far-fetched ending,"I love David Fincher as he's a skilled director that is able to make outstanding films. The Game is one of his most suspenseful yet weaker films.The Game follows Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy banker that receives a gift from his brother which allows him to participate in a mysterious game.Thrillers have been something David Fincher has been good at making. He has the talent to bring out so much tension and stretch it all the way through to create a captivating experience. The Game is another example of Fincher's abilities to conjure suspense as a large portion of this film was tense and very interesting. Not only was it fun to see Michael Douglas get into strange situations but the film leaves us with many questions as to what is actually going on. The constant guessing of what's taking place had me hooked onto The Game's story. It builds and builds to situations that you don't see coming and Fincher utilises its intense premise to its advantage. There's a particular scene taking place in a taxi that's so well executed. As the film was building, I was excited to find out the big reveal at the end. However, when the ending happened, that's when the film came crashing down for me. The ending seemed way too convenient in my eyes and it became very difficult for me to suspend my disbelief.The performances are all very good. Michael Douglas gives one of his best as Nicholas Van Orton. He pulls of the desperation and paranoia the character develops throughout the film really well. Sean Penn is also great in the film even though he has very limited screen time. Deborah Kara Unger did a good job as well and it was fun guessing whether she was in on the game or not.The Game is a strong thriller through its first acts but the third act is where the film asks us to suspend too much disbelief which I wasn't able to do. Despite that, Fincher does a great job keeping the suspense intact and Michael Douglas delivers a strong performance in the role.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A cinematic abomination, shamelessly manipulative","The worst aspect of this film is how the creators don't care to follow through on their convictions. They are clearly nihilistic. Instead of showing this, they play on the desire of the audience members for something coherent. I left the theater (and my viewing of snippets when I run across it in channel surfing) with a feeling of physical violation, of having had depraved intellects smeared across my brain.Too harsh? I don't think so. One is expected to empathize with Michael Douglas's character, in trying to understand that all of his arbitrary injuries are in fact aspects of an incredibly complex practical joke. (No, I'm not going to dignify it with the noun ""game."") Yet one is expected, simultaneously, to believe that some malign organization is genuinely trying to destroy him.The problem with this tension is that if Douglas's free will is ever asserted, the plot (such as it is) instantly collapses. He can't be too smart. He can't think outside a limited set of boxes. He can't match up facts in any way that shows insight -- or else the joke-makers will not be successful in anticipating what he is doing. In short, the story depends on Douglas's character being precisely as vapid as everybody expects of him at his worst, and that he won't give up until they think it best for him to give up.If Douglas, here, believes the premise of a malign power, he would be more likely to slip up -- with a deadly result for himself or someone else -- out of sheer overconcentration on his situation. Too much stress, y'know? You aren't at your most perceptive. Especially with a gun in your pocket. The plot counts upon his virtues, as dullard as they are, while at the same time undercutting all of them.The final twist involves the apparent death of someone truly close to him, at his own hand. Yet did it happen? And is such a shock something to be used to deprive -any- human being of personal dignity? So much so that, shortly afterwards, he's expected to recover and be mindlessly festive? I found this to be an instance of psychological torture. If I wanted this, I'd watch the war in Yugoslavia, and CNN has nearly zero marginal cost.That brilliant cinematography, adept character acting (on occasion), and Douglas's dogged persistence are used all create no excuse for such incoherent manipulation. All we have is a canker on the human spirit.This is a nihilistic cesspool. Don't waste your money, not even on a 99-cent bargain rental night. If you possess any human sensibilities, you'll berate yourself later... when it isn't giving you nightmares.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Fincher's best,"This film is exceptionally one of David Fincher's best film. I enjoyed Fight Club, Se7en, and Panic Room (for the script). This should be considered one of his trademark film. You either like it or something else. The shots and the score all fit to the necessary atmosphere and script. Michael Douglas once again give a great portrayal of a man tortured mentally. The gradually rising tensity and some major twist leave the audience blank, for they know not what is going to happen. And we all love him for it. You are not there only to spy on the party. You are IN the party.

What a thriller should be.,"The first act of The Game (the first 30min) were immaculate. The plot set-up was perfect, characterisation was sublime, it was a textbook screenplay. And from this moment on, I was hooked. The deviation from normality following this immensely realistic opening created an amazing contrast that set the tone of the film.The plot twists come and go, and you never really know what is going to happen - the guessing game is expertly crafted both by Fincher in his direction, as well as John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris in their screenplay.Michael Douglas was faced with the task of holding this film upon his shoulders, as it was essentially a one-man show, and he was amazing. His fraying emotions heightened his downward spiral and altered viewer perceptions of the character as a result. Sean Penn was very good as Conrad, the brother, as is Deborah Kara Unger, as the ever mysterious Christine.Fincher's direction only cements his position as one of the greatest directors of modern day (our generation, if you will). Along with Se7en and Fight Club, his films are cult legends and The Game doesn't let you down one bit.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not fully convincing,"As always, Fincher proves to be a very innovating, intelligent, risk-loving director. There are many very good moments in this movie, and it is, over long periods, simply thrilling. But this makes the end and its flat morality even more annoying. Fortunately, the disturbing power of the previous sequences is strong enough to let you not COMPLETELY ""satisfied"", but the INTENTION to satisfy (and calm) you is obvious.

Very pleasantly surprised,"Another student brought this into my film studies class because he was studying David Fincher as an auteur, and without thinking about who the director was I looked at the box art (a picture of Michael Douglas) and made a very premature assumption of the quality of the film. We had the choice of either watching this or ""Seven"", and I was quietly wishing he had chosen Seven.Fortunately, very early into the film I became hooked. From the start, the plot was fantastic and every time a new twist in the plot unfolded I became hooked even more. Then, disaster struck. The lesson was only and hour long and I had to stop watching. I'm a student with no money - how was I supposed to get this film so I could see the second half!? The part of this film I'd watched amazed and intrigued me so much that I had to find a copy of this film any way I could.That night, I was going to rent the DVD at Blockbuster - something which I rarely do because it's so costly. When I was on my way there, my friend invited me to stay at his house and watch some Ruggero Deodato films (his subject for the auteur project). How could I refuse? The next morning we went to a bootfair, and armed with a little bit of cash I went around looking for videos to add to my collection. By this time I'd completely forgotten about renting ""The Game"" and I didn't expect to see it being sold at a bootfair. You'd have to be insane to get rid of a film like what I'd seen half of! Thing is, I did! It was a timecode version from a rental store I assume. The BBFC certificate logo had TBC stamped all over it and the sleeve was double sided with two versions of the cover art on.It was easily worth the two pounds I spent on it! The rest of the film was even better than the half I had already seen. As the film progresses, there are so many twists and turns in the plot you almost forget what film you're watching! Michael Douglas is very convincing, and seems as confused as the viewer, as does Sean Penn. I was extremely surprised with Deborah Unger's performance too, having only seen her in David Cronenberg (the auteur I'm studying)'s ""Crash"". Her roles in the two films are so incredibly different I didn't realize it was her at first!If you want a gripping thriller, go for this one. You won't want to be in the same situation I was and have to stop watching half way through, it's so gripping you'll be on the edge of your seat until the closing credits. Watch it if you're looking for something slightly different to the norm too, as with all Fincher's films. Whatever you're looking for, you won't be disappointed with ""The Game"" unless you're so much of a pedant you have to point out every flaw in the plot (all of which can be justified).This film will have you paranoid and slightly doubtful about everything you do for quite a while after watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Conned Really Smartly,"Just when you think Michael Douglas has been put through the mill in some of his previous movie roles, David Fincher's stylish, stylised thriller puts him on the rack, through the wringer and generally hangs him out to dry, all at once.Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, an almost 48 year-old investment banker working out of San Francisco. Mega-rich, über-cool and ruthless, we've already seen from the opening titles however that he has considerable psychological baggage, having watched his father kill himself by jumping off a roof when he himself was only a boy. Now he has a failed marriage and stays alone in his mansion, living for the next deal. So he meets up on his birthday with his feckless, tearaway kid brother Conrad or Connie as he calls him, (I guess the clue in the name was right there in plain sight!), played by Sean Penn who gives him the mysterious gift of a card bearing the name C. R. S. Entitling him to participate in an unexplained game which Conrad tells him will change his life.Nicholas succumbs to his curiosity, probably expecting nothing more than a random crowd-mob experience and applies to take part which means undergoing rigorous physical and mental tests but when he finds out he's failed the procedure, his ego slightly damaged, he nonetheless returns to his normal life. Or so he thinks...From there poor old Nick is maneuvered into situations ever more confusing, complex and dangerous, as he's drawn deeper and deeper into the maelstrom. We see him lose his wealth, status and finally his very sanity. Is this all still a game but even if it is, has it somehow spiralled out of control spilling into real-life, driving him, seemingly to his breaking point? Well, you'll just have to watch to the end to see...Considering what the banking fraternity did to the markets in 2008, I was almost happy to see one of their number taken down and apart so dramatically. There are plenty of plot-jumps and plot-holes along the way as one unbelievable situation succeeds another but it's all executed so skilfully by both Fincher and Douglas that I was willing to overlook these and even the pat ending, where I was expecting a twist to the twist.Next time though, I'm sure Mr Van Orton would prefer a plain old jumper of the woollen variety rather the other type he receives here.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

What he wants the audience to feel and imagine, we exactly feel the same way.

Surprisingly Nicholas contacts the company and he agrees to take a series of psychological tests that ensure the company designs a perfect experience for their needs. After that moment, you won't be able to know what is real, or even if the game at least existed for a second. About the protagonist I can say that Michael Dounglas, lived this game from his unconscious, and I can't imagine a better actor for this Character.

Beautiful box with a cheap content,"After ""Se7en"", which I repute a masterpiece, David Fincher returns with this noir that plays with secrets and deceptions. The content is cheap and the rhythm is slow. For more than an hour nothing really important happens. All the revelations are concentrated in the last few minutes without which the film would be a deadly bore also because Douglas is dull and unpleasant. Fincher, anyway, is still a good director: the grim atmosphere is flawless and the flashbacks are wonderful. If only he had had a good script!!!",,Anonymous,Mystery
An original story? No!,"This film is very enjoyable, and may appear to be like no other story. However, viewers should be aware that there are striking similarities to a British TV mini-series from the late 1980's called The One Game. The makers of The Game do not appear to have acknowledged this in their credits. The plot of both is very similar, as is the relationship between the main character and his tormentor. Even the main character's name is similar! Both the film and the TV series are well worth seeing, though both have flaws in the plot, and rather stretch credulity! Compared with The One Game, The Game is less dark and takes itself a little less seriously.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An intelligent mind-game of a thriller.,"'The Game (1997)' is all about the moment, being placed in the shoes of the protagonist and doubting everything you see just as he does, and it works remarkably well considering it has more twists and turns than a country lane. Its various reveals always work because it has the remarkable ability to predict exactly what its audience is thinking and to be two steps ahead of them even when they think they are two steps ahead of it, and it is this underlying intelligence that prevents the flick from feeling cheap or frustrating in any way other than one which would enhance our connection with the core character and strap us in for a mind-game almost like no other. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"An utterly brilliant, twisted thriller","Thrillers, as a genre, are commonly built on the notion of a character having their life turned upside-down, with the expectation that we the audience, if not also the character themselves, will have some understanding of who is chasing or troubling that character, or otherwise making their life difficult. I have to hand it to writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris, for with 'The game' they devised a thriller that goes a step further still and removes any glimmer of certainty of what exactly is going on. Protagonist Nicholas agreed to something not knowing what he was getting into, yes, but the rules and bounds are fully unknown for viewer and character alike. As the mystery, extreme and odd circumstances, and danger mount, the tension and suspense is immense and palpable. The story is marvelously twisted and raptly absorbing, with every intensely flavorful and flavorfully intense scene, and every smallest character, likely to give us a new unpredictable turn. The only thing we can ever count on while watching is that each passing moment is sure to produce something wild, and in turn the viewing experience is exquisite and captivating.The rare scene that's quieter, or softer, provides a welcome, refreshing brief reprieve, fostering a minor sense of dynamics that in its own way only further stirs the pot. It's not that this picture is built on utmost subtlety per se, but it claims fantastic attention to detail in every regard; rich atmosphere at once seedy, gnawing, and uneasy; and undeniable demonstration of the tremendous skill and intelligence of all involved. Esteemed composer Howard Shore, having shown himself time and again over a long and fruitful career to be versatile and reliable, provides a score that reaches deep to the heart of the disquieting ambience that's further bolstered by careful production design and art direction, mindful consideration for lighting, and Harris Savides' smart and patient cinematography, let alone the supremely sharp direction of David Fincher at a point still relatively early in his career. This is to say nothing of the terrific stunts and effects, and the acting of range and nuance, in demanding roles, from mega-star Michael Douglas, underappreciated Deborah Kara Unger, and all others involved. With even the filming locations being absolutely choice, it can't be overstated how superb this is, only ever engrossing us more and more as the minutes tick by.I really didn't know what I was getting into when I sat to watch, and even having gotten a recommendation from a trusted source, I don't think my expectations were specifically all that high. It's safe to say that those expectations have been handily exceeded. I'd stop short of saying this is a revelation, or that it demands viewership, but for anyone who enjoys the genre, it would be a terrible mistake to pass up any opportunity to watch, least of all with its exceptional psychological edge. Is there any way in which the feature falters? We can't say it's the very idea of CRS and ""the game,"" because the wealthy and powerful in real life are infuriatingly capable of almost anything, and to whatever degree the narrative here requires suspense of disbelief, that's the unspoken contract of fiction. If we're being very finnicky we might say that it's minutiae like the use in a particular sequence of fully automatic weapons, for something so powerful is heavy-handed to an extent exceeding a presentation that's already deliberately forceful. In every most substantive and meaningful fashion, however, 'The game' is just brilliant, and I couldn't be more pleased with how good it is.What more is there to say? This is a wholly excellent movie. Almost thirty years later it remains more gripping, exciting, and disturbing than too many more recent works. However you need to go about checking it out, 'The game' is a modern classic that deserves far more recognition.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It is still better than _Benjamin Button_, with its infinite budget and Kubrick-style obsessive perfectionism.I don't want to discuss the film content - just what it was. This is like an extended Twilight Zone episode, with twist upon gotcha upon twist. While these were good, they weren't mind-blowing. The best descriptor is ""competent"". As far as his film's go, it's in my second tier of his selections along with _Panic Room_. Competent but not extraordinary. That said, it's still leaps above your typical Hollywood barf. Fincher managed to snag Michael Douglas for this, one would assume on the tails of the much superior _Se7en_from 2 years prior. That's a minus for me - I find it hard to take Douglas films seriously.But I nitpick. By general standards this is superb viewing for stay-at-home, night in popcorn viewing. It engrosses and keeps your attention. As such I do recommend. But by Fincher standards, it's pretty mediocre, nowhere near the heights he reaches in _Fight Club_, _Zodiac_ or _Gone Girl_.

"The Game works good, but not as well as Fincher's previous film","Director David Fincher shocked audiences everywhere with his dark and grim 1995 thriller 'Se7en' starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Fincher continues his ingenious twists and suspense with this mind-bending thriller that is less compelling, but retains the wit and energy of his style of direction. Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orten, an arrogant San Francisco financial investor living a lonely life . On his 48th birthday, Orten receives a gift from his younger brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn). His gift happens to be a key to a strange company named Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Upon visiting this company, Orten begins experiencing some strange and unfamiliar occurrences that alternates his life. With the help of a local woman named Christine (played by Deborah Kara Unger), he must solve the mystery behind what he believes his reality and what he believes is an illusion.Being a fan of David Fincher's works, this is a film that I had to see. It is not as dark and somber as his previous film 'Se7en' and is a bit more complex in terms of storytelling, but still brings his decent directing style to the screen. This film offers something a little different than rookie detectives investigating murders and facing down a vicious serial killer. Playing almost like a two-hour episode of Twilight Zone, the plot blossoms with frequent twists and turns, and soaring thrills. Those who struggle to follow along with the challenging storyline however, may be left deprived from the film's suspense. Yes, comprehending the storyline can be a bit of a challenge at times. Nonetheless, the story stays strong and diligent for the most of the time, nearly every scene is almost impossible to predict. The main characters played by Michael Douglas and Deborah Kara Unger are pretty solid and the performances are praise-worthy. Sean Penn who plays the younger brother who though offers some decent acting, is a bit underused for the most part. The film sustains itself strongly until it reaches its climax. At that point, the film falls pretty flat.Overall, The Game is a decent movie while it last. It definitely doesn't level up to the ranks of David Fincher's other movies and does suffer from a few flaws. However, it is still a satisfying picture and most of what it needs to do.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Something of a shaggy dog story but well worth the ride,"You've got something if you can slowly ratchet up the tension and keep us guessing until the last minute, but David Fincher's The Game is essentially a high-value shaggy dog story. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but in my book a film has slightly missed the point if you can't watch it again and again.Well, of course, you could watch The Game again and again, but once you know how it all ends, doing so becomes a little pointless. Then there's the danger that whereas the first time round we are sitting on the edges of our seats wondering where Michael Douglas's bad luck will take him next and, not least, what the hell is it all about, at second, third and maybe even fourth viewings - and knowing full well how it all plays out - the viewer will start picking holes here, there and everywhere. That would be unfair, of course, but that's exactly what we would do.But what the hell: you are either reading this wondering whether is worth your time taking a gander, in which case I say unequivocally 'go for it'. Or you have seen it, have your own view about how good a film it is and are wondering what others made of it. In that case, you probably agree with me that it's worth the ride, but starts to lose on points the more you reflect on it.I, too, have been looking at the opinions of others, and should warn the first-time viewer that although it is all hugely enjoyable and intriguing, it is, at the end of the day, just a piece of very well-made, thoroughly gripping hooey.

Quickie Review: The Game,"It's been some years since I've seen The Game. I remember enjoying it very much so. Despite being a step down from his previous film, David Fincher's second outing in urban thriller-mode feels like something of a taut modern classic. A neo-Hitchcock movie if I ever saw one.The film follows a dull and greedy investment banker who is given a card as a birthday present by his brother, who tells him to phone up the company whose expertise lies in some form of enigmatic character building game. Despite phoning up and attending an arranged test he is told he did not qualify. However, after this our protagonist finds some truly odd thing occurring in his life. Are these events real, or are they a part of 'the game'? What follows is an engrossing roller coaster ride with enough twists and turns to keep you at the edge of your seat during the course of its runtime. You never really know what's coming next.Douglas and Penn as brothers are on form in a film I'd recommend to anyone. It's a fun movie for a Saturday evening, but not one that assumes its audience are idiots. Quite the opposite, in fact. If I had any complaints about the film it would be the ending which, for a movie that was pretty believable for the most part, required a lot of suspension of disbeliefBest Scene: Like I said it's been sometime since I've seen it. One part still remains in my mind, however – Douglas is visited by a frantic Penn begging him to forget everything about the game. It's a real um, game-changer in the film because it was the scene that cemented the realisation that ""Oh, hang on. Things are serious here."" (Or so I thought.)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But after watching a couple of thousand movies and reviewing the Game not so long ago, you have to change your mind.Despite the fact that Fincher does not write scripts for his films, he chooses them perfectly and all or almost all films are gorgeous in this regard.Also, everyone plays great here and the tension created in the film works 100%.

I really have to applaud people for managing to enjoy this, but like the minority out there, we can do without this fluff.As a comment on how much you can take the pi** out of an audience without half of them knowing it, then this movie deserves 10/10.

"An Intriguing, But Sometimes Overcomplicated Thriller","David Fincher's The Game is an engaging psychological thriller that plays with tension, paranoia, and the blurred line between reality and illusion. While the film offers a strong premise, solid performances, and a handful of clever twists, its complexity sometimes leads to a sense of being more confusing than captivating.The story follows Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), a wealthy, disillusioned businessman who receives an unusual birthday gift from his estranged brother (Sean Penn): a mysterious invitation to participate in an immersive ""game."" As the game spirals into chaos, Nicholas is forced to question whether the game is a life-altering experience or a carefully orchestrated manipulation. The premise itself is fascinating, with its exploration of control, trust, and the fragility of reality.Michael Douglas does an excellent job portraying Nicholas, a man whose life is built on control and success, only to find himself completely out of his depth. His performance anchors the film, and his emotional journey from confidence to desperation is engaging. Sean Penn, in a smaller role, adds a layer of intrigue, but his character's motivations are somewhat underexplored. The film's ensemble cast is solid, but it's really Douglas who carries the weight of the narrative.The film's greatest strength is its pacing and suspense. Fincher expertly builds tension, and the film never lets up, keeping the viewer engaged with its twists and turns. The atmosphere is one of unease, with a constant sense that something is off, but not quite what it seems. The cinematography and score work in harmony to create a feeling of discomfort and confusion that aligns perfectly with the protagonist's mental state.However, while The Game offers plenty of thrills, it can also feel overly convoluted at times. The plot is intricate, but at points, it becomes so layered in its deception and twists that it risks losing the audience. Some moments stretch the boundaries of plausibility, and by the time the final reveal comes, the film may feel like it's trying just a little too hard to outsmart the viewer. The final twist, while clever, might also feel contrived for some, and the emotional payoff doesn't quite reach the level of intensity one might expect after such a complex build-up.Ultimately, The Game is an enjoyable and thought-provoking thriller, but it doesn't quite live up to its potential. It's a film that keeps you guessing, but it can sometimes feel more like an intellectual puzzle than a truly immersive experience. It's a solid entry in the psychological thriller genre, but the complexity and occasional sense of overreach prevent it from being the fully satisfying mind-bender it aspires to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

After watching it, I was impressed for a few more hours.In addition to the first layer of semantic load, I found the second. It lies in another question, why do people hate their birthdays. This topic is raised in the first half of the film. In the second half, she just sinks. Why do I think there is such a meaning? Firstly, the reaction of the main character to congratulations from colleagues, acquaintances is zero. It is literally written on his face that he is infuriated by all this attention of people who don't care about him.

Solid thriller from start to finish,"Somehow, I missed this thriller entry back then; almost 30 years later, I gave it a try, and the experience was good - for the most part.In The Game, Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy and solitary banker, accepts entering a game after invitation by his brother.

He is smurk, a shmuck that thinks he is on top of everyone. To his demise, The Game is set to shake him to his core - and as the movie progresses, maybe even destroy him.The Game casts some great names: Michael, Deborah Kara unger, Sean Penn in his early days, James Rebhorn on his late days, and, in general, they do a good job. I feel acting in those days were mostly acceptable to great.The pacing of this movie is good. I didn't feel bored at any time, and the thrill is there to keep us going, the ultimate drive being the question of what is the real purpose of this game.The final revelation, though, generates mixed feelings. On one aspect, it brings Nicholas's arc to full closure, yes. On the other side, I myself would also enjoy a darker spin.

WHAT A LOAD OF RUBBISH!!,"I saw this film on TV the other night, and am only glad that I didn't pay to see it at the cinema. A few points worthy of note:Just 'cos a film's directed by David Fincher doesn't automatically mean it's a masterpiece. He's managed to acquire an undeserved reputation as a Hollywood ""wunderkind"", endlessly praised by 22-year-old film-school graduates (or ""readers of Empire magazine"", as they're more commonly known), who think that films shot with lousy lighting and lots of rain are just soooo original (see Fight Club, Seven, etc.).Why is the plot such a copout? The film would surely have been far more impressive if it had stuck to the abstract idea of Michael Douglas being subjected to the Game for the sheer hell of it - I know it transpires in the end that the Game was the whole point, but in the meantime it degenerates into a confused hour-long car chase.Why does Michael Douglas only seem to appear in morally repugnant films? He may look good on camera, but his overall personality seems pretty objectionable.So there you go - The Game is over-rated, over-hyped, over-praised, and way over the top. Plus, while we're being all arty and filmy, the innercity scenes looked like they were heavily ripped off Martin Scorsese's under-rated 1985 film, ""After Hours"":if you haven't seen it, watch it - it knocks The Game over and TRAMPLES on it!!",,Anonymous,Mystery
Manages To Entertain. ♦ 60%,"It took 15 minutes for the plot to save itself from losing me and while it was at it, it used all its resources which could have been used elsewhere.The previous sentence you just read is how you will feel like when you watch the movie: bit confusing. Michael Douglas is fantastic as the protagonist and even the plot looks good, at first. The climax was just lowbrow and maybe 2-3 hair raising. That's it.Following the story of an affluent businessman, it talks about a game his brother asks him to play & finds himself ending up in the wrong places. The journey is entertaining per se. And the audience are in a state of wanting for more. Just then, you are shown the climax & the pieces start falling into puzzle. Yes, it does convery a message or prove a point, but a mild conclusion is just not what I was expecting & it played against the effect it had so wonderfully tailored in my mind. Performances are brilliant and I loved the cast.While it was a lukewarm story, I liked the direction & music.BOTTOM LINE: Give it a try.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Maybe it was better when it originally came out. It feels very of its time and hasn't aged very well.

Game or not?,"Don't ask what the purpose of the game is. Finding out is your goal.Despite a fair share of fantasticism, Fincher's thrillers can't help but like, because they have all the necessary qualities that a wide audience appreciates: great actors, an exciting plot and an unpredictable ending. The third full-length film by one of the best directors of modern Hollywood became a chic example of all his activities and reflected the basic principles of his work with the audience.""The game"" is a constant tension, a permanent riddle that haunts for two hours, tormenting with its main question: ""Yes or no?"". Michael Douglas as a successful, but tired of life banker, and Sean Penn, who played his brother, who gives his relative a strange and slightly frightening gift...In addition to the bright dynamics of the film, there is another advantage - the philosophical meaning, which boils down to several questions. What would you wish for if you had everything? And what would you do if they wanted to take it all away from you? One rash decision, and you become a participant in a mysterious game. A series of dizzying events turns your life upside down and transforms the familiar reality, changing the entire scale of values. But you don't believe.

This movie is the definition of a thriller, and all others in that genre should use ""The Game"" as their template. This movie also ranks number 44 on the 100 scariest movie moments of all time, and ""The Game"" is not even a horror movie. Also, its first person camera shots and eerie situations are sure to suck any viewer into ""The Game"", and even though I'm literally ten years late with this review I hope it was a little helpful.

Great idea - worse execution,"Wealthy and bored man convinces himself that seeming naive game can turn out to be his worst nightmare.

Very interesting, very drawing, but ... could be better.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Twisting the twist,"The reason to watch this movie was Michael Douglas (Nicholas Von Orton) and no problem there as he made a very strong performance throughout. He just doesn't know what's going on as I didn't. Every 10 minutes the story gets a twist and says that all things previously seen are fake, now is the moment of the truth. Then in another ten minutes, again and again and again. In fact, in the end I got a bit tired of this and the constant change was not so entertaining. I watched the last 20 minutes only for sake of curiosity, to know what will be the final solution, which was original indeed. I think less twist would have been more, with more development of Nicholas' character, description of the plots. That way it would worth a second watch for me, this way it was just a fast moving funny action movie.About the idea of 'The Game' - funnily the movie started me to think after a bit - this whole idea is so strange for me. First, it is so awkward that you need hundreds of people and millions of dollars and an incredibly strong impact on your personality to make you a shock and discover 'where life is' and come back to reality. Second, when you constantly discover, that everything previously experienced was a setup, when you showed true emotions and reactions others were just playing around you, when killing your brother was a fake and even your own suicide was a fake - then I think to loose ground and simply my personality would crash. I would no longer be able to trust anyone and any experience because I would constantly doubt whether this is part of a setup or is this 'real'. Authenticity is very important to me in my personal relations, and when someone plays with emotions and trust, all I can do is to let my walls fall build up suddenly, put on my mask, and keep all authentic feelings and reactions inside, and just give a smile to The outer world. Living such a way for a long time would be really a nightmare for me.However, I like the idea of Mother Theresa and Sai Baba, who said ""Life is a game. Play it."" - though the words are similar, somehow that is such a different approach to life than what is presented in the movie ""The Game"".",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

David Fincher literally breaks into your limits of psychological nerves with this gripping thriller.,"The Game (1997) :
Brief Review -David Fincher literally breaks into your limits of psychological nerves with this gripping thriller. The surroundings of The Game are quite insane and eccentric, and interestingly, there is nothing inhuman. Yet, it's mystical. One can recall Anurag Kashyap's No Smoking and learn how much it was influenced by this Fincher thriller, even though it was originally based on some other film. The Game is a game that's terrifying and nerve-cracking. There are no horror elements, but still, it is horrifying. It scares you because humans are more psychologically scared of death than of actual physical damage. This film challenges those psychological boundaries by playing with one's emotions. The idea is to find the lost personality, but no one would expect that one has to go through all this to get that. It is the story of a wealthy banker who is given the mysterious birthday gift of participation in a game run by CRS. The game integrates in strange ways with his everyday life, and he begins to doubt everything around him. He also starts losing his senses. As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a larger conspiracy begin to unfold, and he is on the job to find the main person behind it. John Brancato and Michael Ferris' duo has written a different script from regular thrillers, which compels you to get into it and not take your eyes off. Every next scene has a new trick, and that somehow starts frightening you as a viewer. You feel for the main character, and that's how this film connects you emotionally. Wait for the climax with all your answers, and it'll be a fun ride for sure. Michael Douglas carries the entire film on his shoulder, so there is no other lookout. David Fincher grabs you in his fist for 130 minutes and literally cracks you several times with his nerve-breaking storytelling. On par with Se7en, which I found a little overrated.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great film!,"In my opinion, ""The Game"" is an absolutely breathtaking film and a great mix between an innovative concept and huge acting. It mixes the gripping ideas of producer David Fincher with the representation of a great main character by Michael Douglas.The plot is based on a memorable mix between realistic and unrealistic features. The most exciting part of the story is probably the ending, when Nicholas realizes that the whole story was just a try from his brother to make him more natural and change his type of a greedy businessman. The superb acting strengthen this effect. The perspectives of the cameras are well-chosen, too.So if you want to see a film with an extraordinary story about an egocentric businessman receiving a special birthday present from his brother, you should definitely watch this film",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Functional gimmick expertly executed,"Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a lonely divorcée and extremely wealthy San Francisco investment banker. It's his 48th birthday which is the age of his father when he committed suicide in front of him. His absentee black sheep brother Conrad (Sean Penn) returns and gives him a card. What do you get for somebody who has everything? Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) which Conrad claims to be the best thing that ever happened to him. It's an unique game different for everybody. Jim Feingold (James Rebhorn) does the examination for CRS but Nicholas is rejected. Then he finds a dummy sprawled on his driveway with a CRS key and the game begins. Strange things start to happen. Waitress Christine (Deborah Kara Unger) spills on him and gets fired. They both get sucked into the CRS game.This starts too slowly. There is a general lack of energy. The first 30 minutes almost lost me waiting for things to happen. It wants to be atmospheric. David Fincher is certainly good enough but I find myself not caring about Nicholas. He's a rich annoying douche with very little to like about him. It's an interesting if somewhat unoriginal gimmick. It would probably be better as a horror. I guess it would be helpful if I am naive enough to buy into the game. It would also be helpful to have a younger, sweeter, and more innocent actress to play Christine. The movie never escapes its manufactured sensibility. The point of most of this genre is to have Nicholas act paranoid and for the audience to question his sanity. His sanity is never in doubt in the mind of the audience. It's just one insane thing happening to him after another. And the cops would never say it's OK to murder him as long as Nicholas signed the contract. It's kinda stupid but the movie asks the audience to buy into it. It's so well made that I'm fine with how crazy this game gets. However it does go one too many turn. It would have been much better to leave with a sad ending.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ridin' the game out,"Michael Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker, living a somber, lonesome life in a luxurious mansion that is only inhabited by himself after his divorce. He has become miserable and decidedly unfulfilled lately, but begins to walk down a path of, well, let's say excitement when, on his forty-eight birthday, his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) informs him about a group called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). CRS specializes in something called ""the game,"" which Conrad leaves highly ambiguous, only providing the vague details that Nicholas must try it and leaving him with the encompassing notion that it will change his life.After delaying his visit to the company, to apply for ""the game,"" he undergoes a series of exhausting and lengthy psychological and physical examinations to, allegedly, show his fitness for the exercise. Later that week, he is told his application is rejected, oblivious to the fact that ""the game"" itself has already begun. He discovers this one night when his TV begins talking directly to him, informing him about a series of keys that will come in handy at one point or another. What unfolds is a virtual video game, so to speak, with Nicholas himself, and the viewers of the film, questioning what is real and what is fictitious.Films like David Fincher's The Game provide us with a unique, viable luxury, which is knowing about as much, or sometimes less, as the main character. In this case, we spend most of the film as confused as Nicholas, lost and wandering in the limitless, sometimes unknowable forces of reality. Writing about The Game, or even talking about The Game to someone who hasn't seen it, just doesn't work in retrospect. The aesthetics and plot developments can only be described so thoroughly before they channel lunacy and incomprehensible nonsense. Even seeing the film seems to have the same effect. This is truly a work that exercises in the unexplainable field of cinema and does it great justice.Coming off of Fincher's acclaimed film Se7en, which has gone criminally unseen by me, to follow up with a film like The Game would logically generate mixed reception. The tone it holds is dark and heavy, accompanied by imagery and visuals that are bleak and replicate the look of film noir, and the story is non-linear and possesses a fondness to trick viewers and critics of it. This is a film that likes to play with your emotions and toy with your head as you watch it. Depending on how much of that you can stomach (for me, a film can only do so much of that before I stop caring and see through its roots of being a convoluted mish-mash of storytelling devices), this may be satisfying and wholly substantial. It does what a film of its magnitude should do and that is provide its story and approach with equal opportunities of commentary and explanation. I think I've got one.""The Game"" in itself is something that is used for those who want to add energy, excitement, and thrill to their lives. It's a device created for those who have yet to ""live"" or enjoy life on its own terms. It exists to show its players a good time, and even when they're struggling or beyond scared, it is still the most fun and excitement they've had in years.Take the above explanation in any way you see fit, and add it to as it doesn't even seem to cover the entire span of open-endedness this film has in store. While The Game lacks in emotional character involvement and, towards the end, becomes rather redundant and plodding, it succeeds in developing a frightening and eerie utopia that, while giving its participants satisfaction and adventure, provides them with a scarring, indelible mark. Take that however you want as well.Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by: David Fincher.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Brilliant directing, flawless acting, fine point-at-hand, yet so unsatisfying.","Well... what can I say? The movie gets a stellar grade of 7 out of 10, because the acting, directing, editing, music, and cinematography were all very well done. However, despite a genuinely suspenseful thriller that was 'The Game,' I can't help but feel frustrated at the conclusion to the whole ordeal. There are countless instances in which the main character, and the subject of the deadly ""game,"" acts abruptly upon whatever trouble finds him, yet is lead to believe that the game-makers, a company called CRS, knew exactly what his actions would be. When viewing the film, one is almost certain to, at some point in the movie, ask themselves: how could they REALLY have known Nick (the main character) was going to do that. I can only suggest to see it for yourself, though I can, and will, do so with a high recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
glad to see people are thinking on their own a bit,"I was surprised, after reading some of the comments, how much most everybody thought this movie through when all the confusion was over. It made me happy to think that a lot of people are still capable of absorbing material without blindly accepting it. We all aren't completely mindless fools yet. This is somewhat encouraging, keeping in mind how American education (among others) has been steadily dumbing down over the years. I read that the average vocabulary of a 14 year old has decreased by something like 4 times from what it was about 50 years ago. Anyway about the movie....it was quite suspenseful to my 16 year old mind which hasn't seen many of the movies of the past with similar approaches and tricks. I liked all the little plot twists and the acting was excellent. However, in my opinion, this was a movie, that one can pick apart in terms of realness and believeablility, what with all the simultaneous occurances and split second decisions that somehow coincide with something else that is suppose to happen. Basically, in real life the whole concept behind ""the game"" would be a very hard one to achieve......too many things could go wrong. This doesn't bother me too much though because I have always thought that movies' main purposes are to entertain and provoke thought, and THE GAME reached great success in both of these areas.If anyone reading this has totally contrasting views to what I said I would really like to hear them so email me.

I actually rented this because Michael Douglas is someone who I feel can really carry a picture. He has a presence which is unequaled. That voice of his has power. Also in the movie is Sean Penn and he is a guy who always has integrity in his film choices. Also cast in this movie are a couple of folks that really got pulled out of the mothballs. Carroll Baker played the elderly housekeeper and I will always remember her as the teenage Baby Doll.

Not Finchers best,"No matter how outlandish the story may seem, there has to be at least a bit of your brain that's saying as you watch ""I could see that happening."" That's when you get drawn into the story. That's when suspense takes hold. That's when you begin to be able to feel the fear of the main characters. That's when a psychological suspense-thriller works really well. Unfortunately, ""The Game"" doesn't work really well. It doesn't do any of the above. It's simply not believable. Never once in the movie (or at least once we were introduced to the game that Nicholas Van Orten was playing) did I have the thought that ""I could see this happening."" Never. It was too outlandish. Think about it. In order for this game to work, pretty much the entire City of San Francisco would have had to have been onside. Van Orten could have done any number of things or (and here's the real problem) encountered any number of people who - not being in on the game - could have changed things completely. The game (to me at least) is unworkable; unplayable. Since that was my feeling right from the start, I didn't get pulled in by the story. I found it long and drawn out. The writers tried valiantly to keep me on my toes by throwing twists and turns and surprises - but I really didn't care, because I just didn't believe any of it. Too bad.Too bad, because the cast was good and solid. Michael Douglas was in character, playing a fairly stereotypical character for him, as Nicholas Van Orten, and Sean Penn did well as his little brother Conrad, who presented Nicholas with the game as a birthday gift. I liked Deborah Unger as the ""waitress"" Christine. Honestly? She's attractive, but not the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, but she had a chemistry with Douglas, and she did present a real aura of sexiness, even though that wasn't particularly what the character was about (the ""I'm not wearing any underwear"" comment notwithstanding!)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Don't get me wrong, this is an above average film, it just could have been so much better. David Fincher fans go and have a blast, but be warned, it isn't a patch on Fight Club or Se7en.  But it is good fun; it just tries to be too smart in the one twist too far finale.  It'll keep you guessing though.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a thriller with enough paranoia and gusto to be one of the better films of 97,"The Game is basically an elaborate hoax, but unlike at least several others I've seen over the past several years, director David Fincher gets something really right about this one. The fact is the plot is so convoluted at times, so pumped with the kind of paranoia and surrealism to give Hitchcock the willies, that it almost works to annoy the viewer with the amount of manipulation it puts across. But, as it turns out, it is more about being manipulated than it is about, well, to put it this way, the audience isn't necessarily cheated as in a lessor picture. Adding to the intelligence level of the audience (or, for some, lack thereof) is superlative craftsmanship on the part of Fincher, who has carved out for him with his roster of films from the 90's quite a nook of edge-of-your-seat thrills that, at the least, isn't boring.Michael Douglas is really excellent here as well, on par with some of his best work of the past decade and a half. At first his performance seems rather subdued, like a distilled version of those businessmen he plays in almost every other movie he's in. Again, part of the manipulation not just on the audience, but tenfold on the lead character. Nicholas is given a birthday present from his brother (Sean Penn), and it turns out to be 'the game', where anything can happen, and rather relentlessly at that. Soon Nicholas, cold and sort of detached from those around him, becomes super-duper paranoid and on his toes as the CRS (Consumer Recreational Services, ho-ho) goes to work on him. Pretty soon he has no money, no home, almost no life. Or is it? It's not too inappropriate to have the opening image over the credits of jigsaw puzzles is not far from what the film is itself, just one huge set laid out on the carpet.If there could be anything that started to bug me as the film started to near its climax, it would be that, well, it's a reminder of both how much I like and dislike getting mind-f***ed by a movie, particularly a brilliantly shot-one like this. And the more I think about it, however, it may possibly lack something that Fincher's follow-up, Fight Club (possibly his best film to date), had, which was a connection of character to some kind of statement about something. Has the hoax that ends up showing itself as amounted to something in the way that it should've, or could've? The cat-and-mouse factor of the script, direction and acting, and the whole atmosphere is probably on par with Fincher's other work, but is there a connection with how Nicholas was and how he does become, or is it all meant for the gimmick?Still, with this observation, if not quite a criticism, I still recognize this film as being a mile ahead of other films that have come in its wake. Too often do I see a film where a lead character- or characters- get the run-around (so to speak) just for the sake of the script. This time in the Game, the director- by way of the almost TOO convincing performances (that scene between Douglas and Penn in the car & stairs at night had me talking to the screen for the right and wrong reasons)- doesn't insult the audience's expectations. Bottom line, go in with a suspension of disbelief, and it's one of the better elaborate hoaxes put on film in the 90's.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not one of Fincher's best, but a fun movie nonetheless","This movie starts very weak, but ends very strong. You just have to accept that the game makes no sense and that it's totally dependant on things no one could possibly predict or control. Once you accept that, it's a lot of fun to just go along with this film.As I mentioned earlier, the first half (and maybe a bit more) isn't the best. Becuase there's apparently only so much you can do with the premise of an alternate reality game gone too far, it becomes pretty repetitive very quickly. However, once Michael Douglass wakes up in Mexico, the film picks up again and becomes better than ever.It's not one of David Fincher's best movies (in fact, I would say it's his weakest film, not counting Alien 3), but his direction is so good and the thrid act so bonkers that I have to reccomend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Game on!,"What do you get when you blend the narrative structure of ""The Usual Suspects"" with Alfred Hitchcock's theme of the ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances, and the moral universe of Anton Chekhov's short story ""The Bet""? You get this finely crafted thriller directed by David Fincher (Alien3 and Seven) and starring Michael Douglas (Falling Down, The American President).Michael Douglas plays a wealthy investment broker who appears to have it all. For his 48th birthday, his younger brother (well-played by Sean Penn) gives him a gift designed for the man who has everything-a membership in a recreational services club that custom-designs experiences to meet the unique voids of each individual client (or so they say). The catch is that clients never know what's coming, and the line between real life and ""the game"" gets more and more blurred as the story unfolds.The movie pushes credibility to the limits, and occasionally, beyond. But the story is engaging enough that I found myself restraining my disbelief until after the ride was over. One of the things that can make this an enjoyable movie-going experience is taking some friends along who like to probe deeper meanings.""The Game"" works not only as an engaging thriller, but also as a moral parable, a social commentary on the hollowness of contemporary society, and a kind of philosophical riddle. Viktor Frankl has described the illness of modern humanity as noogenic neurosis-an existential vacuum in the soul-that leaves us longing for deeper meaning. While ""The Game"" does not offer profound solutions, it does provide an engaging story about the problem.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Boring, to say the least.","Sean Penn and Michael Douglas are two actors, who's work I had until this film came out, found always watchable, regardless of plot or role. However, 'The Game' changed all this for me as from the very moment the opening titles rolled it became apparent that the only game I would be playing would be one of endurance. Weighing in at a hefty 128mins this was not going to be easy. One bad plot twist followed another as the director tried to squeeze the last drop of blood from a farcical concept and very shaky premiss. The worst seemed to be the never-ending ending. The story was concluded time after time only for a new even weaker plot twist to surface. Finally when the film did end the final scene was fittingly as unsatisfying as the rest of the film.I can truly say I have never regretted not walking out of a film as much as this one in my whole life, two hours of watching paint dry would have been a much more fulfilling and worthwhile experience.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Wonderful photography,"We all know that certain aspects of ""The Game"" are impossible but who cares its a movie. I was floored by the photography of the movie. The darkness in the movie is clearly used as an art form. Much like an artist working with their color pallet, which would include blue, black, and various shades of grey. The film demonstrates a washed out appearance which adds to the overall mood of the film. Even the film grain adds edge to the film. The lighting adds unbelievable ambiance to certain character scenes/interactions. For example some of the kitchen scenes with Michael Douglas. The sound brings the film to an unbelievable level. Especially the kitchen scene where Michael Douglas gets his birthday dinner. Everything is so loud and has a major echo within the kitchen. This is a perfect example of demonstrating the loneliness in his life. Even down to the song ""White Rabbit"" adds to the overall ""Alice in Wonderland"" confusion of the movie. Finally the echoing piano gives the movie a somber feel, a feeling of loneliness. It also adds to the overall chaotic feel of the movie. Never fully engaging in a orchestra at times but just a single instrument dictating the mood of the movie. Unbelievable use of sound in this movie. Strongly subtle and very low key. Matter of fact I am sure many people have missed this fine trait of the movie due to the lack of proper equipment to hear the sound. It can be best described as an immersive sound field that barely hangs in the air and eventually falls to the ground. One that your not really aware as being there until you listen for it and then it disappears just as easily. Very similar to the tactile qualities of the ""Green Mile"" This movie should find its way into peoples movie collections not only as a masterpiece but also as a solid test disc.

A Decent Thriller from Fincher. Are You Game?,"In ""The Game,"" Michael Douglas plays Nicholas, a cold and unlikeable investment banker who is in desperate need of a life-lesson. Enter his brother, Conrad, played by Sean Penn. As a birthday present, Conrad sets Nicholas up with a mysterious company that intends to play a high-concept, high-risk game with his life. The end results promise a life-changing experience, but when things get too real too quick and as it gets harder and harder to tell where the game ends and where it begins, Nicholas begins to lose his grip on reality and on himself.The film, directed by David Fincher (""Se7en"") is a stylish and moody piece, with the director's strong visual sense in full-form. Although the film never quite nails a specific tone (thanks, in part, to its flawed script) it is anchored greatly by Michael Douglas, who keeps us attached to a character who is rather unpleasant on the whole. Along the way, he makes acquaintances with a beautiful waitress (Deborah Kara Unger) and survives gun-fights, car crashes, a trip to Mexico and a fall from a very tall building. Is his life falling apart, or is this just all part of the elaborate game he entered? You can't help but shout at the screen because it is so blatantly obvious where the film is manipulating us. Thus, the film's biggest flaw: It doesn't leave much to the imagination.Those seeking a well-made thriller will at least find some goodies with ""The Game."" Even if you reach its conclusion before its running time is over, you'll at least remain engaged in watching Nicholas' redemption while Fincher's style makes for an impressive looking film regardless of plot-points.

"Confirming the theory that a good director can save a script no matter how many flaws it has, David Fincher made this ""The Game"" an exciting thriller","Could a script with such great potential for failure be turned into an interesting film? In the hands of a great director the answer will always be: ""yes"". The plot of ""The Game"" introduces us to millionaire Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), a successful shareholder who receives an unusual birthday present from his brother Conrad (Sean Penn): a card with the contact details of a company specializing in entertainment. Suspicious, he goes to the site, fills out all the forms and performs physical and psychological tests, but his application is rejected. However, after bumping into waitress Christine (Deborah Kara Unger) at his favorite restaurant, strange things start to happen and he suddenly realizes he is being involved in something much bigger.Just a few minutes are enough for the viewer to have access to some essential information about Nicholas Van Orton. His meticulously planned office, his imposing house (production design by Jeffrey Beecroft) and his fine and elegant clothes (costumes by Michael Kaplan) show that we are dealing with someone very rich, while memories of his childhood and a quick conversation with his ex -wife exposes her emotional fragility. Thus, it doesn't take long for the vulnerable protagonist to take off the clothes of a successful man and present his fragile and human side, gaining the audience's empathy, which is so fundamental to the success of the narrative, no matter how difficult it is to sympathize and root for a guy. Arrogant whose vulnerability is being so rich that the countless possibilities laid out in front of him ended up making him an inactive guy, bored in his opulent office, luxury car and mansion. The aforementioned inclusion of a childhood trauma and, consequently, the protagonist's fear of repeating the same mistake as his father, is a guide that every mediocre screenwriter has followed in recent years.Playing a less greedy and more restrained version of his most famous film character, Michael Douglas once again plays a successful shareholder, with the difference that here his Nicholas Van Orton (or Nick) is also a character clearly affected by a strong trauma from his life. Childhood: the loss of the father. Speaking almost always in a low tone of voice, Nick slowly loses control of the situation and the fluctuation in his tone of voice accurately indicates this. As the narrative progresses, the shareholder transforms into a constantly tense person, who leaves his comfort zone to face unusual and extremely dangerous situations that push him to the extreme limit - and the actor demonstrates all of this very well in his increasingly heavy countenance. Very different brothers, Nick values discretion and common sense, while the bon vivant Conrad doesn't hesitate to attract the attention of a crowded restaurant just because he wants to smoke. Even though he appears only a few times on the scene, Sean Penn plays a fundamental role in ""The Game"", sounding convincing especially when his Conrad appears completely desperate in a conversation in his brother's car, deceiving not only the protagonist but also the viewer himself.Even more important is the competent participation of Deborah Kara Unger as Christine, the mysterious fired waitress who follows much of the protagonist's trajectory and who, at different times, directs his and the audience's line of reasoning. Sounding simultaneously convincing and mysterious, Unger does very well in a difficult role that could ruin the project in the hands of someone less talented, as the doubt that her character generates in the viewer is fundamental to the success of the narrative. So, when she sharply tells Nick to wake up and realize he's been caught in a scam, we believe her - and the tea followed by the news of the zero accounts makes us fall once and for all into the trap prepared by CRS. Convincingly portraying a CRS employee, James Rebhorn is another who maintains the aura of mystery that surrounds the narrative with precision.The text by the duo John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris even starts from an interesting point: what if there was a company specialized in creating intricate games for people unhappy with their reality in particular or their lives in general? It's an implausible argument, but Aristotle already said that verisimilitude needs to come closer to reality and not be held hostage by it. Therefore, this apparent surrealist is not only possible but also attractive from an artistic point of view (it also contains an interesting commentary on the illusions produced by cinema). Furthermore, the two screenwriters manage to transform it into an engaging narrative, with mysterious characters (the one played by Deborah Kara Unger is the greatest of them) and frightening and unnerving situations.The ingenious script involves practically all the characters in a mysterious aura that makes everything very suspicious, even leading to excessive planning, which does not completely harm the quality of the film, but makes some moments quite implausible, such as when a taxi is thrown into the river with the protagonist inside. What if he didn't remember the doorknob or suffered a serious injury in the fall? There were divers on duty, but was it worth the risk? Moments like this exist in abundance in ""The Game"", which can irritate more skeptical viewers. If we think coldly, it would be necessary to involve practically the entire city for this game to work correctly; and, what is even more complicated, it would be necessary to anticipate practically all of Nick's steps and prepare for possible changes in route. The second aspect generates several inconsistencies in the story and betrays one of Brancato and Ferris' most creative choices: initially denying the game. When Nicholas Van Orton (yes, that's his name), the character played by Michael Douglas is not accepted by the company, doubt is created about the nature of all subsequent events. The most obvious of the options is the conclusion that the ""prank"" is really happening and those responsible said ""no"" just to create doubt in the protagonist's mind. The other possibility is that there is something strange going on and no one knows exactly what it is. However, after walking these tortuous paths, the film culminates in the simplest possible answer, already outlined with excessive clarity throughout the narrative.Despite these inconsistencies, what makes the film work is the direction of its narrative. Employing his usual symmetrical shots and elegant camera movements, David Fincher appears much more restrained and discreet most of the time, which doesn't stop him from changing the pace drastically, when necessary, as in Nick and Christine's exciting escape from CRS in which a dog almost catches up to them and in the electrifying nighttime chases through the city streets. Obviously, the dark look obtained by Harris Savides' photography helps a lot to increase the tension in these moments. Using worn archive images to reveal the tragic memories of Nick's childhood, Savides prioritizes sober colors for most of the time, standing out for the excellent use of shadows in the predominant night scenes to highlight the narrative's aura of mystery, further reinforced by the dissonant soundtrack by Howard Shore.Also counting on James Haygood's dynamic editing to provide an increasing rhythm that illustrates the protagonist's increasingly troubled mind, Fincher guides the narrative with dexterity, building an efficient suspense through intelligent choices. Notice, for example, how the discreet smile of one of the men at the bar indicates that Nick had been hooked by the game, also functioning as a discreet hint to the viewer. The conversation with the news presenter shortly afterwards confirms that he was already involved in the game - and at this moment, the viewer is also completely involved in the narrative. The strategy is clear. Fincher always puts us in the same position as the protagonist. The entire time, we have access to the same information as him and share the same doubts and anxieties as the character, in a choice, in fact, that is not common in thrillers. Normally, suspense is heightened when we know something that the character doesn't know, but in this case, we don't have any information beyond what Nick already has. Thus, we are forced to put together that puzzle from his perspective, which is essential for ""The Game"" to work.After falling into countless traps and becoming completely involved in Nick's drama, we are led to the shocking final sequence in the CRS building, in which the complete tragedy seems to be taking place, but an interesting twist reveals the big trick behind the curtains and guarantees the happy ending. The problem is that this ending, despite being impactful, sounds somewhat implausible when we think more about it. Still, thanks to the great work of Fincher and his cast, the film works well. Confirming the theory that a good director can save a script no matter how many flaws it has, David Fincher made this ""The Game"" an exciting thriller, capable of keeping the viewer tense most of the time, although, when we rethink the narrative in a more logical way, this tension can turn into questions and generate some frustration.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You just lost The Game,"As Michael Douglas' banker-turned-pawn is thrown around the city, addled and confused, you begin to understand just where the story is heading. ""The Game"" is a film with the tiresome features cut out: no love-story complication, no excess story baggage, just the fun bits you wanted to see.Starring Douglas, Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger, this movie relies on slight suspension of belief. Being a high-flying banker, Douglas is gifted by his brother (Penn) one ticket to 'The Game' - a living-game experience that promises to be unlike anything he has seen before. This, whilst not a novel concept, is executed effectively enough to keep the audience guessing throughout, and manages to wrap the story up semi-succinctly towards the finale.My only qualm, however (omitting spoilers), is style of the ending - it feels like a departure from both the nature of the characters and the story, given the way it portrays itself as a maze of lies and deception. Still, Penn and Douglas do enough to pull it off, and the story is rewarding in the sense that you are still unsure of the conclusion till the final act.It looks and sounds decent, but nothing that makes or breaks the film. The environments do look genuine (Douglas spends a lot of time in the high-life frequents of the city), and the CRB Building is a particuarly smart touch.Is this a world beater? Not really. Is it a fun watch that will pass the time? Certainly. Douglas is authentically cynical-turned-exasperated, and Penn's estranged brother angle is engaging in his few scenes. ""The Game"" won't blow your head off, but it's not half bad either.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Terrible!,"There are two reactions to this movie - People like it or hate it. Put me in the second camp. Whether it was ""The Freshman"" or ""The Truman Show,"" you've seen this bad, bad movie before. It's the wish fulfillment of the arrogant. It goes something like this in ""the Game:"" You may be an a**hole but you're such an important a**hole that everyone in your life (even Daniel Shor) is playacting just for your benefit, just to guide you to a lesson. It still flatters self-important d**kheads into thinking that people in their lives are pawns manipulated for their benefit.Regardless of continual trick endings, you've already suspected the whole thing is a ruse, because if it's not, it's a pretty standard and boring conspiracy thriller. The movie has a few funny moments early on then it becomes mysterious, then it become more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then... Get the picture? Did you really want me to say ""more mysterious"" again? No! Because part of the fun of a mystery is being allowed to play along. Providing developments instead of underlining the mystery again and again. ""Contact"" did this beautifully. Although it eventually gets nowhere, every fifteen minutes or so you're allowed to see a little more of a full picture. Here, the mystery just deepens without any actual developments. Wasn't anyone in a preview shouting, ""Yes, David WE GET IT!""? It gets so tedious that I actually skipped three or four chapters onthe DVD. I just didn't care. It reminded me of ""Total Recall"" and ""Sleuth."" 2 other movies that wear you out with pointless plot-twists and reversals.Hollywood airheads think they recognize this as an idea film. ""The Game"" remains a game to no matter to what absurd scale it grows, even though there is no way you could even anticipate the random causes and effects in a single day of your life. Free will is completely erased in this movie. That's just how smart the controllers of the game are. Sadly David Fincher isn't that smart and there are plot-holes you could throw talentless scriptwriters through. How did they know where he'd jump off the building? Don't ask such silly questions! Surface effects are much more important than credibility. And that final ""wow' ending (Think of this movie as a really long tedious sermon) matters more than any internal logic. As idea films go, this one tugs - If rich pompous businessmen require a ruse this elaborate and expensive, who would actually care about them?Finchers ideas are really lame. I can now add this to the list of very bad Fincher movies. Seven, Alien 3, and it's so bad that it even makes me reconsider Fight Club and it's lame ending.The people I know who like this movie are self-important blowhards most in need of a lesson like this. I knew enough to suspect their raves. I would jam this baby into my top five worst movies of all time list.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of my 'top ten' favorites: Fincher's best film,"David Fincher's 'The Game' is a surprisingly human thriller. Instead of the 'big thrills' with no thought or care for the characters, Fincher delivers to us a film that has some surprisingly poignant moments, mixed with some real smart 'big thrills'. The film's opening sequence, set to a quiet, somber piano piece sets the tone to a thriller that will impact us emotionally, as well as jerk our adrenaline.Nicholas Van Orton[Michael Douglas] is bored. He makes sarcastic, biting remarks about his life while at the same time preparing for his 48th birthday, the same age at which his father killed himself. His brother Conrad[Sean Penn] surprises him with a birthday gift, a free membership to a company that, as Conrad says, ''will make your life fun.'' Since he really doesn't have very many other leisure activities and the memories of his father are bothering him, he decides to sign up. What he doesn't know is that 'The Game' may be too 'fun' for him.The film is boistered by superb performances, including Douglas' best since 'Wall Street'. Deborah Kara Unger impresses as Christine, the waitress[or is she a waitress?]. Sean Penn is quite good[in a role meant for Jodie Foster of all people] at playing the somewhat spoiled and mouthy 'little brother'. The script  has wickedly funny dialogue and gives the film a slight 'black comedy' feel. As usual in a Fincher film, the cinematography is dark and forebodding and creates a 'noir' atmosphere of sorts. Howard Shore's music is excellent: Instead of attacking us with bombastic chords, a sound as simple as a piano tinkling is used to make our hearts race. The plotting is ingenious and one plot twist after another is instigated until the film creates a spider-web of fear and paranoia that has us mind-boggled. The films themes[of redemption and paranoia] are followed through right to the end in an ending that some think is supremely contrived.Why? The film has followed its logical course to this destination and fulfills its themes. I personally LOVE this ending and think it is one of the most surprising ones I've seen in recent movies. It twists us around one-hundred and eighty degrees, flips us upside down and leaves our mouths agape in a 'WOW' shape. I ask, 'Is there a better way to end a movie than that?'I highly recommend this film: it is an astounding. arresting and emotionally exhausting thrill-ride that deserves multiple viewings to fully appreciate...........A true classic..... 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A One-of-a-Kind Thrill Ride!,"""The Game"" is the one of the best thrillers of 1997, and of all time.

A typical Fincher twist, which I won't tell you about now, I'll just say that it's very good... The performances are all very good, but I especially liked Michael Douglas here, who acted brilliantly.

Awesome Fincher atmospheric film.,"Alfred Hitchcock used the term ""refrigerator movie"" to describe certain films. According to the great director, refrigerator movies are well-paced thrillers that work effectively while being watched, but fall apart upon later examination (while ""standing in front of the refrigerator""). David Fincher's The Game is an obvious member of this class of motion pictures. As it's unspooling on screen, the film is hugely entertaining, but there are several significant plot holes that grow wider the more closely they're investigated. Douglas- who is pretty much in every scene is fantastic as the lead. This is a great thriller to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Fincher's Tremendous Knack for Suspense is Betrayed by a Cadre of Loose Screws,"Michael Douglas accepts an invitation to join a mysterious exclusive ""recreation activity"" at the insistence of his loser brother, and is then thoroughly terrorized by the game makers. It's a mile-a-minute barrel ride over the edge of a waterfall, with the audience left in the dark right alongside the protagonist. Young director David Fincher plays up the suspense gorgeously, but isn't quite able to compensate for a few inherent flaws with the premise. First and foremost is Douglas's leading part, a thoroughly unlikeable one-percenter who's such a Scrooge it's impossible to grow too invested in his fate. In a way it's cathartic to see him tormented by such a brutal series of twists and turns, especially in the afterglow of the Wall Street bailout, but the film goes out of its way to paint him as a sort of tragic hero. The plot's reckless yanks on the steering wheel, too, aren't all they're cracked up to be. Those constant swerves provide a great series of unpredictable thrills, but ultimately ring hollow when our suspension of disbelief is nudged too far beyond the coincidental. The entire closing sequence, in particular, is just so dependent on things happening in precisely the right place, at precisely the right time, in precisely the right way, that it left me questioning the validity of everything that had come before. A nice effort, and a strong-legged concept, that falls short in too many important areas to deserve high marks.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"The Game Is up There, but Not #1","David Fincher's movies Fight Club and Se7en were two of the most badass, plot-twisty movies I've ever seen. This gave me high expectations for The Game. I wasn't disappointed, but took a few issues with the movie.This movie has the same great camera work seen in Fincher's other movies. I noticed a few small issues with sound mixing/editing. Let the fact that I don't know the difference between mixing and editing say that it's not much of a problem. Still, if I see a guy jump over a wall, I want to hear a thudding noise when he lands. It's a blockbuster, come on.Nicholas, the main character, is a selfish bastard at the beginning. We could have seen anyone in the world sign up for the game, but it's a banker. A rich guy. One of the proverbial one-percent-pigs. Understanding his back-story and father's suicide already makes Nicholas more of a real person, but he does actually change over the course of the film. It's not exactly bad-guy-to-nice-guy, but it's a believable change, considering what happens to him and a good choice of a character to put in ""the game.""Having seen Fincher's other work, I expected a huge plot twist kind of ending. There are plot twists and reveals. A plot twist is when the whole film changes course (in a way that fits) at/close to the end. A reveal, which is expected from the start, is when the big mystery is solved. I expected a plot twist when a reveal is what I should have been waiting for. You can't predict a plot twist. Other than the fact that it was a reveal, I didn't personally care for the ending. It was not a bad ending. It was a solid ending. Everything concluded in the way it needed to, but I couldn't help thinking, ""that's not how I would have done it.""The Game isn't Fincher's best movie, but it's not bad. That being said, I liked it much more than an ""eh, wasn't bad."" The Game follows Michael Douglas as a selfish banker who signs up for an ambiguous entertainment service. The movie does a great job making the audience question the reality of each event. Is it the game or not? Though I didn't really like the direction the ending took, I can't say it was a bad ending. The Game gets a 7.5 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

They won't leave me alone! I'm a goddamn human-piñata!,"David Fincher follows up ""Seven"", the by ""The Silence of The Lambs"" influenced thriller that broke out of genre conventions and subsequently became the second most influential thriller of the nineties, with another puzzler. ""The Game"" lays it's cards out in plain sight from the get-go: figuring out the object of the game is the game. Which doubles the fun if Fincher's smoke and mirrors fool you.When his unkempt brother Conrad (Sean Penn) first tries to warm him up for the idea of actually participating in ""The Game"", Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), aggravated, says 'he hates surprises'. Conrad pleads: 'It's a profound life experience'; prompting Nicholas to reply: 'Like a stroke?'. Fools speak the truth when they're joking. Van Orton soon finds himself in a roller-coaster with no seat belts, and he forcibly comes to an insight when the cart plummets into the abyss.If there is such a category, I'd put ""The Game"" in with escapist thrillers: pretension-less, fun, keep-you-guessing films with twists as a goal onto itself. Therefore, people shouldn't stumble over the improbabilities in the plot. It's like reading Jim Thompson, a man who does not know the meaning of the word restraint as far as hardboiled characters and plot u-turns go.Fincher directs straightforward thrillers with such a sleight of hand, I can think of no contemporary directors who can match his skills in the genre. Cinematographically, ""The Game"" was well ahead of it's time. It seems DP Harris Savides and Fincher make a great team: they also collaborated on ""Zodiac"". Both films' night time scenes take my breath away. Add three time Academy Award winning composer Howard Shore into the mix and what you get is a very effective psychological thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Live a little. Place the game,"It's no surprise, this film, with it's originality of story, is steered by Se7en director David Fincher, though really at the time it was a low profile movie that came and went, hitting the video shelves within months that followed. Douglas of course fits this role, as a sour, bitter, ex divorcée, who lives a life of riches, as an investment banker, or something like that, with a great spread, and has just turned 48. His younger, coke dependant, mentally troubled brother (Penn, in good form) who like other people, close, who have been shunned away from him, gives him a gift, and thus what begins, becomes one living nightmare after the next. He's given this voucher for a mind and health improvement facility, called Consumer Recreational Services, where based on many questions and analysis's, improves that life of the person (player) who partakes in the test. I mean, really what do you give for the man who has everything. Okay, I will admit this movie is very far fetched, but there's a message there too. We see a little bit, how the Douglas character has became the way he is when witness to his father's suicide as a kid, in light coloured sepia tones of flashback done, in of fast motion, that are pretty cool, and creative. The character Douglas creates, that of Nicholas Van Orton, is one of longing fascination. He's an angry and one might say, though not really knowing him, intimately, grudgeful guy, but one thing of certitude, is that, he's not happy, or content. At the end of the film, we learn how the real game is played, as though one big joke has been played on us through the entirety of the movie, as Douglas too, but it's an exciting and maddening ride getting there. The jump scene and landing, like the one in Lethal Weapon, here, more spectacular, is just another far fetched moment, which has you asking, ""How can an ending like this exist?"" but for this film, it works. Douglas, who's never played it more straighter or stricter, and the shaky, fidgety character of Penn are two other reasons, apart from the film's originality to check this low profile, but ""goodie"" pic out. Not as good as Seven, but who's judging.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"I haven't watched it yet, but I bet it's good. Not Great, but good.","How can I declare that ""The Game"" will be good, but not great, before I have seen it? By reading other people's comments. The common theme of most of these comments is that ""The Game"" is a clever, if outrageous, fantasy driven by fine performances from its stars, Michael Douglas - who I have always found to be engaging and believable - and Sean Penn, who is often very effective, but can also be overly theatrical and oddly self conscious. Somehow Sean manages to convey intense discomfort and boundless confidence simultaneously. It's actually kinda weird. In fact, I find Sean to be a weird person - a curious mix of contradictions and clichés. He rails against the abuse and despoliation of our natural wilderness, but he smokes cigarettes furiously. He demands to be acknowledged as a gifted profound artist, but is keen to develop his persona as an ""everyman."" If he ever manages to stop ""acting"" - whether in a film, or while being interviewed, or on the location of the latest natural disaster - he suddenly becomes powerfully effective, but those moments are few and far between. He too often comes across as self centered and smug. That's a problem with emotionally fragile personalities - they're afraid to just be themselves.OK, so now I've trashed Sean Penn without having yet seen his performance. No doubt we can all agree that prejudice is a shameful vice, so I should probably refrain from any more blind conjecture, but this is my dilemma. Should I risk 129 minutes of my so very(?!?) valuable time on a Sean Penn vehicle, wagering that I haven't once again been duped into a another frivolous disappointing distraction? It's a risk, it seems, I'm willing to take if the overall experience is something that at least rates as ""pretty good."" If I'm right about my hunch on this flick then I'll leave this comment intact after I watch ""The Game."" If I'm wrong, then I'll add a note correcting my premature condemnation.

A very original thrill ride that can make you think about what matters in life.,"Some movies have a distinct tone and rhythm, and you just get immersed in them, and it's that proverbial ""emotional rollercoaster."" These are the best movies, in my opinion. The Game is one of those. The music really helps with achieving that immersion.In the end, it is hard not to go over the movie in your mind, consider if the plot holds together when you finally discover what is happening, and ultimately it does not entirely hold together, it has contrivances necessary to realize this story and requires you to suspend disbelief and/or not think too hard about the plausibility of some sequences. I mean, Forrest Gump made you suspend disbelief about a lot of stuff, but it was also a great movie.If you consider folk tales, they are stories that have exaggerated or unrealistic or supernatural elements, so you must suspend disbelief somewhat to enjoy them. And we can and do suspend disbelief, and thus we can and do enjoy them. But some movies try to present a plausible reality, like a ""what if this really happened,"" and when THOSE movies cheat with obvious fake and contrived plot elements, it knocks us out of the story and makes for a bad movie. Well, I think the Game and Forrest Gump and Fight Club and some other movies along those lines (maybe the entire James Bond series) are sort of like modern folk tales... If you judge them against realistic dramas or thrillers, their contrivances will seem like a flaw. If you consider them like, say, a Paul Bunyan story, you don't immediately hate it because there's no such thing as a giant blue ox, right? The point is, the Game has contrivances, but only those needed to tell this very subtle and complex folk tale. (I realized Legend of Bagger Vance is probably another good example of this kind of movie.)The great thing about the movie is that tells the story of a man who has all the material trappings of success, but he's basically a prisoner of his own life, having gotten unknowingly trapped into plodding along like an ox turning a millstone with no way to escape because his own mind is the trap. There's a deep truth here, that people get into their own ruts and opportunities to truly step out of our rut and change direction and gain a better perspective on life, are rare. You watch the movie, see the main character unhinged from his ordinary life to where he can have a transformative moment, and you maybe can have a little echo of that yourself, thinking about your own life, how you might be in a rut and not taking time to appreciate what really matters. That's a pretty big feat, and not many movies can do that.I saw another reviewer who wrote the movie is good once, but has no re-watch potential, but I completely disagree, and have seen it at least 4-5 times.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It is spectacular, and is an absolute masterpiece from David Fincher. It is also the only film I have seen directed by him. This film is also very disturbing, and very mature. Not for chidren under any circumstances. 15, and over. Very disturbing movie. It is good, but would be a bit too mature for persons under 15. Michael Douglas' performance is fantastic in this movie. He is giving his all in this movie. The cast in this film is stellar. Such a great film.ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
you're so lucky if you haven't played THE GAME yet...,"For those who haven't seen the movie yet...I envy you greatly. You don't know what awaits...A very successfully built tension and mystery, accompanied by dazzling scenes and continuous surprises...Just when you think you've figured it all out, you realize you're on the wrong track. You reach lessons, you think ''don't trust anyone, not even your brother. Always consider your enemies. Beware of complete strangers''. You think ''be more careful before taking a road which you barely can see, which you barely know about''. But is it really what the film says? You wonder...so, just play the game and let it flow. Don't listen to what others say. Follow what your mind says. But will you be so lucky to escape? With no wounds? With no regrets?Are you haunted by your past? Does history repeat itself? Or is it all a set-up? Innocent, or guilty?I don't want to go further...Just sit back and enjoy. Don't be too quick to decide...With the gloomy atmosphere increasing the number of question marks in your head, great scenario, immensely successful direction by Fincher as always, and Sean Penn strengthening his place among my all-time favorites, a 10/10 for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Game Within A Game Within A Game,"Once in awhile a movie comes along that completely alters your understanding of what a good movie is. This was the movie that did that for me. It has raised the bar on my expectations of movie-making and what can be accomplished.I'm not sure I can adequately describe how epic this movie feels in every sense. There is a reverence and respect for every element that goes into filming a movie. It comes together as a beautiful work of art. The set design, music, casting - it's all perfect and no detail is spared or overlooked.There is a grand, atmospheric feeling to the entire film that makes it an unparalleled cinematic experience. It is subversive, dark, chaotic, and like being trapped in a hall of mirrors. One gets a feeling of paranoia by viewing this film and then they begin to question if their own life is a game, and to what extent. There is a cat and mouse quality to many scenes that creates a feeling of constantly being on the run and that it is never safe to stand still, even for a second. The movie unfolds somewhat like revealing the inner layers of a matryoshka doll - there are unending layers to the game.This review would not be complete without mentioning Deborah Unger, who I found to be absolutely captivating. She has a sultry, simpering manner of speaking that I'm not sure I've ever seen before. There is this off-handedness that comes off as rude but also very sexy and vixen like.Viewing this well into the 21st century, I now understand that the late 90s were a golden era for films like these that really celebrate the art of film making. This movie feels whole, complete and classic, like a fine wine that must be sipped many times over to grasp the full complexity it offers.A masterpiece, and a benchmark for filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Dangerous games.,"This film tells how Nicholas Van Orton, a smug and cold millionaire, enters a bizarre and unique game that promises to play with his life. But when the game starts and Nicholas sees the twisted and perverse way unfolds, things start getting out of control. Directed by David Fincher (director of the film ""Seven""), features Michael Douglas as protagonist.The truly wealthy have always had a reputation for being arrogant people, cold, impersonal, smug and only concerned about themselves and their business. Nicholas Van Orton was like that, even disregarding his own brother. And it is from him that Nicholas receives a different birthday gift: participation in a game organized by a mysterious company that everyone seems to know but about which nothing is said nowhere. Intrigued but afraid, Nicholas boards the game without real sense of where he is in, which says a lot about the personality of some rich people. The film will thicken up gradually, leaving the audience in anticipation and securing it constantly. It is an addictive movie where Douglas shows all its value and can brilliantly interpret your character. All this makes this film an excellent thriller, perhaps one of the best of the late twentieth century.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best thrillers!!!!,"One of the best HOLLYWOOD thrillers ever created in the history. I remember I was sitting and scrolling through the TV and suddenly I stopped on this movie. IT has just started and since that minute I was sitting on the sofa and watching this movie. It caught y attention and I was unable to detach from it. The plot is very interesting and the tension is kept till the very last minute of the film. The creators of this films are geniuses. They payed attention to every little detail. Also the films like this which involve a ""game"" in them, require much more work and hard work to avoid any misunderstanding and to give the feeling of the reality.

High Class Hokum,"'The Game' is the sort of film that Hollywood does best.  Michael Douglas plays Nicholas van Orton, a wealthy banker whose brother (Sean Penn) signs him up for a real-life game.  When the game proves not to be too much fun, and van Orton finds himself unable to stop it, the question of where the game begins and reality begins is not easily answered.  Director Fincher handles this material adroitly, ratcheting up the tension as van Orton fins himself in ever deeper trouble - but it's also very funny, the plot is preposterous, but enacted with such conviction that it keeps you gripped, even as you laugh at its sheer outrageousness.  Full marks must go to Douglas (a natural in the role), Penn (playing uncharacteristically nerdy) and Deborah Unger, excellent as a tough and sexy femme fatale.Fincher's films all seem to have a similar quality, films that dare you to take them seriously but which ultimately make fun of you if you do.  'Se7en' is senseless in terms of the motivation of its characters - 'Fight Club' appears at first to be a study of modern masculinity, but turns out to be just a very clever joke.  The key is to enjoy the joke, and the ride, at the same time - and in enabling the viewer to do this, 'The Game' is perhaps his most successful (and least pretentious) work.  I was riveted, and although it is nonsense, even moved by the end.  Great stuff!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Surface-smart (with shallow results),"Michael Douglas plays steely-cold investment banker in San Francisco who gets a curious birthday gift from his ne'er-do-well brother: membership in a mysterious club which promises to enrich Douglas' existence. At first, the pranks are elaborate but silly, but eventually the icy businessman encounters blackmail, entrapment, attempts on his life, and finds himself quickly losing his cool. The film, stylish yet limited, only works if you accept Douglas' reactions--but I didn't believe it for a minute when he freaks out in a public place because his briefcase won't open. There are not so many 'errors' in the film as outright implausibilities, and Michael Douglas as an actor finds himself in quicksand, occasionally looking just as ridiculous as the plot. Director David Fincher is becoming rather predictable: once again, he gets the proceedings off to a sluggish start (with stilted introductions to his players) and doesn't follow through on promising ideas or with basic logic (as when Douglas finally calls the police about a break-in, yet the scene is left unresolved). The picture is frustrating, but not in the suspenseful sense. It should've been smarter. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Sell all you have run and see The Game,"My younger brother, whose Stanford-Binet IQ score is 145, rarely shows enthusiasm about anything. That being said, when he does occasionally get excited about something it's for a good reason, and I've never known him to be wrong.One quiet evening back in 1997 I received an email from him that said, ""Sell all you have run and see The Game.""

Entertaining and clever,"Before I watched this film, I heard some people compare it to the Truman show. First of all the Truman Show has Jim Carrey (a clown 'actor' - his 'acting' abilities are badly shown up here), this has Micheal Douglas, the Truman show is totally boring and unintelligent, this is entertaining and intelligent. In summary the Truman show is rubbish this is again quite the opposite.I think this film is entertaining from start to finish as an action/thriller intends to be, but avoids all the common action cliches involved of tacky one-liners when something blows up. It also has clever twisting plot, in that it constantly leaves the view wondering whether he's been conned out of all his money and his life, or whether it is 'just a game'. The same applies to the characters involved, you never really sure who's real and who's not. You can also see the point of the game in trying to add excitement to his mundane and seemingly unhappy life, the old chestnut of being rich, but so what? its only money - is clearly present. The direction, acting, set design, stunts etc are all very impressive as well, and most of all the attention to detail.With all these elements put together I think this is a very good film, one of the best films I've seen made in the late 1990's. (Along with Lock Stock, Snatch, Smoke (1995), and American Beauty). Also note: Traffic is superb, watch it (video/DVD in America, cinema in UK), if you haven't already.Admitably this film has many 'flaws' plot wise, in that obviously CMS couldn't practically do all the things they did, with the precision they did. But this doesn't necessary mean that the film isn't good nevertheless, we don't know if this is set futuristically - where some of things could be possible, due to technology currently unimagineable. And theres no reason that he wouldn't react the way he did right at the very end, everyone is different - its naive to think he would be angry necessarily rather than relieved.Although I can see how this film isn't for all tastes, as a sense of realism is essential to some people - maybe the less open-minded and unadventurous audience, who knows? I gave this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Great Film, Buy it Don't Rent It","I suppose ""The Game"" was the first film I ever saw that had a twist ending that was actually twisted. ""The Sixth Sense"" was a great movie, sure, but the ending wasn't twisted. A shocker, yes, but not twisted. Even the killer from ""Se7en"", Fincher's masterpiece, wasn't a twist ending. A twist, yes, a surprise, hell yes, but a twist ending? No.With Michael Douglas and Sean Penn headlining a cast that also includes James Rebhorn and Armin Muehler Stahl, you wouldn't expect a twist at all. No, with these actors you'd probably expect maybe a nice little thriller or maybe even a comedy of sorts, and that's why ""The Game"" is such a masterful film. These actors are so completely taken out of their element it's scary.Douglas is Nicolas Van Orton, a rich man who's unhappiness in life has been noticed by his brother, the care-free, James Dean-ish Conrad Van Orton. Conrad gives an unthanking Nicolas a card for CRS, a company that will make Nicolas' life better. And so begins a long, perilous, and unimaginably entertaining psycholgical mind game where Nicolas' life doesn't just turn upside down, it turns inside out.I loved ""Se7en"", so I had high hopes for ""The Game"" and this film didn't at all disappoint. In fact it raised the bar so much that I've made a point to see every Fincher film since. (Fight Club and Zodiac are also fantastic films) The camera-work is awesome, with each scene having and holding a growing sense of claustrophobia.The acting is just superb. I don't think Michael Douglas is able to turn in a bad role. He's just as good in this as he was in ""Wall Street"", and will be when ""Wall Street 2"" comes out this month. Penn is also very good, showing his stripes as the free-wheeling brother. Deborah Unger is beautiful and underrated as an actress, I wish she'd be in more movies like this. Stahl and Rebhorn show why they are also some of Hollywood's most underrated blood.To sum it up, ""FANTASTIC MOVIE."" The acting, the direction, the cinematography, the film as a whole, awesome.

Mystery-Action Thriller with a soul,"The Game is an excellent piece of film on many levels, not least of which is the strong philosophical perspective I believe it supports.  Man's attempts at self-aggrandizement are ultimately doomed to failure, and it is sad indeed to watch someone careening heedlessly down the path of personal success with little regard for its effect on who they are.  Conrad's gift to Nicholas is not just some life-enriching experience; he is giving Nicholas back his soul. There are many other excellent aspects of this film as well.The cinematography alone is worth a second viewing, especially the grainy Super-8 style bits at the beginning set against the silent backdrop of those giant trees on Nicholas Van Orten's elegant estate, and the action scenes are crisp.I used to dislike the way Michael Douglas was always playing this type of character, but I truly believe he was born to play this part.  This movie, along with A Perfect Murder, has renewed my appreciation of him as an actor.The editing and storyline were very tight, with a good pace and rich detail that constantly keep the viewer alert for fear of missing a crucial clue to what is going on.

One of the best movies of all time in spite of some negative criticisms,"The plot of the movie is one of the most mysterious and surprising ones so far and I think about it, the recently made movies with plot twists such as The Machinist is nothing in comparison with The Game. The plot may be summarized as for his birthday gift by his brother, a businessman is engaged in an organization that arranges games in exchange for money, but soon he realizes that it is not a game. The Game is an underrated movie which in contrast, according to some audiences overrated. Besides very smart plot, the things make the movie an excellent masterpiece are Fincher's story telling, music causes mystery, atmosphere and Michael Douglas. I believe that it is an easy role may be, but Douglas seems the best choice for this role. After watching the final scene, every detail, every dialog, every event require re-interpreting. One of the best twists so far. Even just the relationship between Nicholas and Christine makes the movie enigmatic. Is Christine a femme fatale who then decides to help him? Is she a femme fatale pretends to be a good girl? or Is she a bait? Another point, Fincher reflects Van Orton's nightmarish situation perfectly also with a very stylish direction. Unbelievably, some people say that it is a plain story, the movie's theme is know the value of life. This is just an interpretation and no need to say that it is much more than that. Let's remember It's a Wonderful Life. The Game and that film are extremely different from each other, but the thing I try to say is that if we look from this point of view, the movie's theme is the same, know the value of life, in spite of the challenges, don't give up etc. but does this simple theme make the movie weak? It's a Wonderful Life is a great movie. Therefore, as said, the very consistent script, the plot, Fincher's story telling and direction, the very successful atmosphere, music and Douglas's persona make the film great and Sean Penn is our bonus. I like the final and cannot see any wrong or simple point. When I watched it first in 1997, the reaction in the final made me seriously bothered, that's why a lot of people dislike the movie, they say it ruins the movie, but I don't see it as a flaw or call it a bad ending, if you ask me, it was a bit frustrating. It is just like if I was him, I would not do what he does. The Game is one of the movies of my life.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Multitude of Mind Trips and Surprises!,"I'm not going to tell you much about this movie except that you MUST watch it, and you SHOULD watch it at night without anything that could interrupt your experience.  Turn of the ringer on your phone, disable your pager, put the kids to sleep.  You will be pleasantly drawn into questioning reality.

"Starts Off Slow, But Suspense/Mystery Builds To Incredible Finale","The director of ""The Game"", David Fincher, is well-known for his groundbreaking films that take viewers on psychological thrill rides. This one falls nicely into that categorization.For a basic plot summary, ""The Game"" sees workaholic businessman Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) given a gift certificate to the mysterious ""CRS"" company by brother Conrad (Sean Penn). When Nicholas decides to give CRS a try, he is thrust into a far-reaching ""game"", of sorts, that touches every aspect of his life.When this movie starts out, it looks like just any other Michael Douglas movie (where he plays the jerk boss). It is a bit slow to get off the ground and will have you wondering which direction the whole experience is taking. About 45 minutes in, though, the film kicks into high gear and only keeps accelerating until the end.This is the type of movie that will have you thinking about its possibilities the whole way through. Just when you think you have it figured it, it throws you another twist again...and again...and again. By the very end, you'll even stop guessing and just resign yourself to the fact that Fincher is going to blow you away no matter what! I hate to call this a ""twist ending"" film, but it shares many of those same characteristics.Overall, ""The Game"" impressed me with its ability to effectively create high drama, character development, and a sense of mystery throughout. If psychological thrillers are ""your thing"", then you can't go wrong here.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best,"I have no idea how this movie flew under my radar and never got my attention this whole time since I'm a big thriller fan and have watched hella movies especially of the specific genre but it doesn't get the recognition it deserves.For me at least not once through the whole movie did I get bored, it's tense and it can fasho keep you on the seat long enough to make you wonder how its going to end.I loved the plot twist right after the first plot twist at the end lol. I know it's an old movie and most people prolly have watched it already but if you haven't give it a try it's not going to dissapoint.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Players Wanted.,"Nicholas Van Orton is a very wealthy San Francisco banker, but he is an absolute loner, even spending his birthday alone. In the year of his 48th birthday (the age his father committed suicide) his brother Conrad, who has gone long ago and surrendered to addictions of all kinds, suddenly returns and gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to unusual entertainment provided by something called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Giving up to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and all kinds of weird and bad things start to happen to him.If I had to pick one thing out of this movie that would have people talking for days or even months, or why the movie is talked about so many times (I assume, when it came out) was because of the ending. The TWIST ending. You're thinking it's just another twist ending, right? WRONG. This ending would either make you HATE the movie or LOVE the movie. At first, I didn't like it, or better phrased, I didn't get used to it. I may suggest people to see this movie more than once to get used to the ending because it's going to be stuck in your throat for quite awhile.So what's so controversial about this twist ending? I don't know. Well, I do know but you have to find out for yourself. I'm not going to ruin the surprise. I've probably build it so much that you're wanting to watch this movie already. I'm sorry I did that. Let's get back on topic. What I loved about the movie, after seeing it for the second time and after I got used to what I just saw, I loved the twist ending because it provides a moral. Yes, indeed the ending provides a moral, much along like a fairy tale story. It's like loving ""Citizen Kane"" because of its ending.However, the whole movie was very ingenious. Very unpredictable, I must add. This may be even one of the most unpredictable movie you'll ever see in your life! *sigh* OK. This movie will sure make you think a lot. Before I continue, I literally thought about this movie in my sleep the day I saw it. I was still thinking about it when I woke up. That's how great this movie is! It's one of those movies that will have people talking for days and days! OK, well, the first few minutes of the film really pulled me in. I was intrigued. VERY intrigued.However, there came a point when the movie did lose its steam. It's when Deborah Kara Unger comes in. Now, I would've just preferred her to not be part of this movie or, better yet, not come as early into the film because I liked Sean Penn playing the game by himself and not with a partner. That's just me, though.But overall, I loved the plot for the film and it did keep me guessing from beginning to end. My mind was literally blank. I love the whole puzzle feeling from the film. It gives you one piece at a time until the ending where it puts all of the pieces together. It was really great to have seen this movie. It gives us an important lesson (but I'm not going to say a thing) and this thriller is just that unpredictable that you can't believe it!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing,"After I watched Fight Club, I never thought I would ever see another movie of comparable quality.  The Game is of comparable quality.  I guess that David Fincher has a knack for choosing excellent projects to direct.  I am still in a state of shock over how wonderful this movie is.  Usually, I am able to figure out movies well before the ending is revealed, but I was completely engaged for the duration - trying to figure out this one.  If you have not yet seen this film, you had better.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

THE GAME  takes you for a suspenseful thrill ride !,"Michael Douglas brings the style, Sean Penn brings the edge to this gripping tale.

For its true roller-coaster ride effect it reminded me of a movie called 'Fallen'",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It just doesn't make you care,"Let me begin by saying this is easily the worst and most dissapointing ""high-profile"" movie I've ever seen.
It starts off well, with visually pleasing establishing shots of the world our protagonist lives in, but scene after scene it looks less organic and more off-putting. One could say it's a purposeful act that's meant to enhance the feeling of the inorganic nature of the realm we're observing. I'm not talking about that kind of ""off-putting"". It just looks ugly.For most people, the glaring issue of the film lies in its hardly-believable plot, and the absurdity of the idea that Douglas' actions could be anticipated to the last detail, as well as the fact his character never really does something off-beat to disrupt the CRS. This can all be ignored if we view the film as mindless entertainment, but it takes itself far more seriously than that to let it get away with that excuse.The atmosphere is described as dark, yet it feels comical, and the viewer is left unable to fully process the weight and severity of what's happening.The really big issue this movie has it it fails to be everything it's supposed to. For it to be an entertaining movie of the mystery genre, the game Douglas is playing would have to be entertaining. It's not.
We see him get overwhelmed with absurd situations, that fail to create tension and entice us, instead generating sheer frustration for the viewer. After a while it just makes you indifferent to his plight, and rather than craving resolution, you wish for it to end.On the other hand, for the film to be a compelling mystery drama, there needs to exist character progression in order to justify layers upon layers of mystery. The protagonist is supposed to be shown experiencing growth and change based on the situations he finds himself in. Bluntly said, he's supposed to come out of the game being a better person, at least that's what the supposed point of the movie is. We never really get to see the effect of ""The game"", not even after the grand finale, and certainly not throughout the movie. We're just supposed to take it at face value that he's a different, better person now.This is hard thing to accept, as it robs the audience of a certain kind of reward of growth and resolution.To sum it up, The Game fails as entertainment, mystery and character study.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This film made me lose The Game,"Rule 1: You are playing The Game.Rule 2: Whenever you think about The Game, you lose.Rule 3: Loss of The Game must be announced.A very interesting and thought-provoking film, but with the unfortunate side-effect of making you lose The Game. Anyone that liked The Matrix or Truman Show should definitely watch this. The acting is good and the film generally very involving. You really feel the increasing anger and confusion that the main character (played by Michael Douglas) feels as the film progresses. The film is also very fun to watch again and again, especially if you keep score of how many time you and the other viewers lose The Game throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I want to join The Game once in my life time,This is the first time ever I've been blown alway by the talent behind the movie The Game that is director David Fincher for directing such an awesome crime thriller that i can't even predict anything so the final twist hit me hard and let me speechless for a moment.Everyone performance is fantastic and above all is Michael Douglas and Deborah Kara Unger.It sad that when you finish The Game the replay value of the movie is very small cause you already know all twist and turn so I can't really find myself watching The Game again with anyone,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Twists and Turns,"The Game is an extremely well-executed movie. The main character was interesting from the beginning. Then I thought I know what the goal of this movie was and I was actually right. They wanted him to realize how rude he was with others. But of course later in the movie this thought changed, because of the twist and turns, which really got me. In the middle of watching the film I realised that I had seen this movie before, but that meant nothing, because all the twist got me.The acting of Michael Douglas was outstanding, maybe this is typecasting, but it was certainly good. I was gobsmacked by this, amazing film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Lame,"A fabulously rich investment manager signs up for a mysterious activity known as ""The Game,"" which completely disrupts his life. It gets off to an intriguing start, as the anticipation builds for the game. Then the game begins and weird things start happening to Douglas that make no sense outside of sci-fi/fantasy realm. Yet, one watches with some interest expecting everything to be sorted out at some point, a point that never really comes. When the inevitable twist is revealed, one is left bewildered because it invalidates pretty much everything that has happened in the movie. This unbelievably stupid movie doesn't just call for suspension of disbelief, but also suspension of intelligence.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A ridicules, well-done thriller. Wait . . . what?","The Game doesn't try to be anything except a standard, well-done thriller with an intelligent moral. In David Fincher's mind, that was all he was trying to accomplish. Did he do it? Well . . . I'm not sure I have a definitive opinion either way.On a technical level, The Game certainly succeeds. David Fincher knows how to use a camera, and I'm not sure anyone, including the most negative reviews of this film, could say otherwise. The Game creates a flawlessly dark atmosphereliterally, but not so much figuratively. Instead of jumping on the wagon and trashing the viewer over the head with horror clichés as similar movies do, The Game slowly builds up to its over-the-top moments in an attempt to immense the viewer in reality before going into the unbelievable. If this movie were in the hands of any other director but Fincher, it would have been the single biggest cliché-fest in cinematic history because it wouldn't practice any subtly whatsoever. For example, the clown in the opening of the movie was fully grounded in The Game, but in any other movie would have just looked like a cliché prop. This is a credit I do have to give Fincher . . .But it's also a credit I have to take back by the end of the movie. Simply put, I've seen a lot of unbelievable movies, and I usually vouch for them. ""Unbelievable movies are rarely as unbelievable as real life,"" is something you'll always hear me say. Not so with The Game. At all. By the midway point, the level of ridicules things happening brought to me to the point of laughing. Though other reviews have taken the time to carefully label and point out every plot hole, there is one big one that few people are seeing. The people behind the game could not know every single move the main character would make to such a precise degree. Period. When you finally figure this out by the middle of the movie, the entire plot become worthless and very formulated.The other major problem I had with The Game is it's absolutely nothing new or original in the least. Thriller writers have used this exact plot so many times it's second nature to the hardcore thriller fan, such as myself.And when I say ""rehash"" I mean it in every way I can. The Game is so slow-paced and tedious, not to mention repetitious, I could honestly see people shouting ""We get it, come on!"" at the screen. Oh the irony: what is the point of a thriller if it isn't thrilling? Entertainment valuealongside originalityis almost a dead concept among modern directors, isn't it? They're so fixed on making sure their movies have some sort of cliché, pretentious social commentary they forget that watching a movie was once, dare I say it, a fun thing to do.Don't get me wrong. When I say movies lack entertainment value, that doesn't mean I'm not all for movies that scar the viewer and show them something meaningful, but The Game isn't that either. The big moral point at the end is just another cliché in the pit of clichés The Game already was. We got it back with A Christmas Carrol and It's a Wonderful Lifewhy did we sit through this tedious movie just to hear old news? Excuse the overused pun, but in every aspect The Game loses. It leaves the viewer feeling like they were just cheated in the same way the main character was, but not in the meaningful way.

"""The life is dream""","A Kafkaesque atmosphere and a very good acting. Exploration of illusions, desires and the human limits. Illustration of old Calderon de la Barca ""The life is dream"".

A great film for tension, script and a brilliant Michael Douglas falling in a different world. Only problem- the end. The happy-end as ordinary solution but a real error in this case. A joke after a beautiful story for save the appearances. After the father's gesture, the party. A moral solution for a surrealistic show.
