A very pleasant surprise!,"Having seen and enjoyed (if not been bowled over by) the original, I was surprised and delighted by this movie that seems to prove that Dreamworks, while still not quite on a Pixar level (Yet!) could soon catch them up. It handles much more sensitive material than the first movie and tackles some truly dark and heavy subject material, but manages to keep it from becoming a drama by dropping in comedic material in a manner that is never jarring, out of place, or desperate. Lord Shen made for one of the most delightful villains of recent movie history. His push against the future contrasting with Po's struggle with the past was wonderful to watch. Po's talks with his father brought a tear to my eye in more than one moment in the film. This company and production team have firmly established themselves as formidable storytellers and I'm eager to see what's next.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too Awesome,"My biggest fear about sequels is it's gonna end up pretty bad and ruin the first one. But I remember, Dreamworks already understand how to make a true good animated movie so I don't have to worry. Now the sequel just got more awesome. Non-stop action and non-stop laughs. The heart is also there. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is just as good as the first one.The trailer makes us dubious but this is Dreamworks. Anyways, ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a great continuation of the series. The story still has a heart and some scenes can almost move you to tears. The movie has bigger and more Kung Fu action & yes, the action never stops. It's all kick butt action.I like it how they improved the editing. Remember Megamind, It feels like you were flying in every flying sequences. They did the same thing in ""Kung Fu Panda 2"". Fast Moving Action that it's fun to see it even if it's in 2D. I don't really bash 3D though. The jokes are obviously everywhere. Even in serious scenes it suddenly has humor.The new comers from the cast did a great job. Gary Oldman is definitely good at being a villain in movies even if it's animated. Michelle Yeoh made her character likable. Jean-Claude Van Damme is awesome even though his scenes were few. This movie still has the same style from the first movie. Magnificent flash animation in the intro, flashbacks, and the dream sequence. Nice music score. And a lot more.I just said this movie is as good as the first movie but if I had to pick which Kung Fu Panda movie is better then it would be the first one. It's more heartwarming but Kung Fu Panda 2 is already good enough as a sequel because it's bigger and too awesome. Unfortunately, It's too awesome it moderates the depth a little bit but it's entertaining at its best. To be honest, this could be the best movie of the summer so far.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The return of awesomeness.,"The adoption conversation was funny, I had to pause the movie because I was laughing too much. It's pretty much as good as the first movie. I think my favorite part of the first two movies are the villains. I love that they're menacing, their motivations are believable and they're memorable characters. I think the main characters all feel similar to the first movie. On paper there are changes, like Po has learnt Kung fu and all, but he's still just this clumsy, lovable panda. The animations great, not a huge step up from the first but it didn't need to be because it was already good.I can see why I loved this as a kid. I think I my love for Kung fu panda stems from a cartoon network show ""Chop Socky Chooks"" which came out around the time of the first movie, if I remember correctly. I enjoyed it. Kung fu panda two is a worthy sequel, I don't think it's a major upgrade on the first movie but that was already good.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A perfect sequel to go with the original film.,"I had seen the teaser trailer for the awaited sequel to Kung Fu Panda, and I was psyched! Now I have seen Kung Fu Panda 2, and I find that both the original film and this sequel are awesome!Po currently enjoys his role as the Dragon Warrior. But then a band of bandit wolves attacked the Artisan Village for metal. But during the battle, Po noticed a symbol on the bandit leader's armor that triggered a memory from his past, thus letting the wolves escape. Po asks his father, Mr. Ping, where he came from, but all the goose can tell him is that he found Po as an infant in a vegetable crate behind his restaurant and adopted him.After receiving news of Master Thundering Rhino's death at the hands of the white peacock Lord Shen, who wielded a dangerous weapon that posed a threat to Kung Fu tradition, Master Shifu sends Po and the Furious Five to stop him in Gongmen City. To find out how the story unfolds, you'll have to watch the film yourself.So overall, I really loved this film from beginning to end; it was perfect to go with the original film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda 2 is a bit darker than the first,"Kung Fu Panda 2 is a bit darker than the first – as most sequels are – but there's nothing here that will damage your kids.Kung Fu Panda 2, little moments that undermine traditional action-movie tropes to hilarious effect.The film is funny, but never outrageously so, reducing the laughs to find poignancy with Po's parental quest. The movie is a visual feast, accentuated with a crisp, effective deployment of 3D, moving with stunning fluidity and fierceness, packed with extraordinary detail.The set-pieces in this movie are more exciting than most action movies. True, animation gives you a lot more breathing room when it comes to imaginary battles, but there were fights and clashes in this movie that were just stunning.Hans Zimmer's score is an energetic.characterization Gary Oldman as the film's primary antagonist Lord Shen who is an albino Indian Peafowl and Victor Garber as Master Thundering Rhino, a Javan Rhinocerosia are awesome.The focus on character is so surprisingly sharp that the conflict seamlessly fuses with the rest of the material, becoming accessible toeveryone in the audience.Overall, the messages are great - be honest, help each other, love your friends and family, be true to yourself, stick together.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The peak of dreamworks,"If I knew that I would give a sequel about a panda doing kung fu a 9 out of 10 I wouldn't believe it
But my god this is how you do a sequel. I love the first movie, but the blend of comedy, Acton, atmosphere, plot and heart gives an actual emotional experience that completely trumps its predecessor
There is no obvious flaws about this movie, it takes what 1 did good and improves it flaws to create an experience that's great for both kids and adults",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda 2,"After his surprising success as the ""Dragon Warrior"", the cheery ""Po"" is hoping to take it easy. History, though, has no intention of letting him sit on his laurels as it emerges that the slighted peacock villain ""Shen"" has designs on taking over the globe. We learn from a brief retrospective a bit about the cause of his bitterness and it seems that he and ""Po"" have an overlapping provenance that might just explain a few things for both of them. Thing is, ""Shen"" has developed an all-conquering secret weapon that can cause even the most formidable of fortifications to tumble, so it's going to take all that ""Po"" and his five best friends can muster if they are to thwart the dastardly plan and save the nation from the peacock with feathers as razor sharp as his wit! This is becoming my favourite animated franchise. It successfully mixes some pithy dialogue with loads of characterful and colourful action and it's message of teamwork and inter-reliance is subtly delivered amidst a sea of entertaining mythology and adventure. It's quickly paced from start to finish and though I could have been doing with a little more of the sceptically sagely ""Shifu"" it's still just about as good as the first film from 2008. Great fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best of the series,If kung fu panda was star wars then this one is esb . This was back when jack black was at its peak with Angelina back when she was married to brad Pitt. This is also the first DreamWorks cartoon to be directed by a woman and has found great success in China.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Kung Fu Panda 2Being on the endangered species list is a good indicator of how successful your species is at martial arts.That is why the giant panda in this animated movie must be some sort of anomaly.When Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), a malevolent peacock, learns from a mystic (Michelle Yeoh) that a panda will overthrow him, he orders the race's annihilation.Years later, Shen's shocked to discover a panda, Po (Jack Black), survived the genocide to become a Kung Fu Dragon Master.Welding a cannon, Shen sets out to conquer China and destroy Po and his Furious Five (Seth Rogen, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, David Cross, Lucy Liu).An ominous origin tale, Kung Fu Panda 2 delivers equivalent slapstick action to the first, but with a new level of story complexity.Besides, why waste your time decimating the panda population, when their lack of sex-drive will do the job for you?

Very predictable in terms of the content,"Well, the movie was a total waste compared to the 1st part. It seemed to be forced upon people to watch a Sequel of a beautifully done movie during the 1st part. I don't think people should make sequels with non-sense content like this.Seems like the Dragon Warrior seems to make a fool of himself all the time. And needs someone to rescue, which I think is so stupid. Many time we can laugh at the dumbness of the Panda.There were few moments when movie was very interesting, especially the Panda's chase around the city. Otherwise, it seemed like those old fashioned movie where hero(s) family is destroyed by villain and hero takes revenge.My rating is only basic on the graphic content for the movie, have tried to portray things very realistically. But yes, 1 very disappointing thing is the 3D effect, somehow putting on the glasses makes the brightness go down. Many times the clarity is missing big-time.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Complete Contrast,"The first word I can say about this movie is, wow! Now once again I know that I enjoy animation movies more than anything but this is one of my top 5 favorites. Kung Fu Panda 2 when I first saw the trailer looked like a typical sequel and kind of a corny ending line, ""This could be the end of kung fu..."" despite the fact that I liked the first movie. However, the past tense of my sentence pretty much tells where this review is headed, not to mention the stars, but onto the review.I am only going to choose four of the many characters to talk about for understandable reasons. Po (Jack Black) obviously going to be the star of the movie has excellently transitioned into the role he played. During the first movie, he was socially awkward and never took kung fu seriously, but in this movie it really makes it feel as if he has been shown the ropes a little more and he has matured significantly. For example he is enjoying himself with the Furious Five rather than trying to fit in, and he is also more comfortable with his technique, shown during fighting sequences.Tigress (Angelina Jolie) I feel was a lot more accepting in this movie, which does not necessarily fit her description of the previous movie, but once again maturity comes back into play. On the other hand though I feel she is a little too accepting though. I don't know if this was deliberate, but she kind of has a relationship with Po unlike any of the other members of the Furious Five have. The boat scene is a perfect example of this because she tries to get Po to open up to her, and for those who have seen the movie, the jail scene where she gets the truth out of Po. Perhaps Dreamworks did this on purpose, but I guess I will just have to wait and find out.Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), not really a major character in this movie, actually he is more of a minor one. Shifu looks like he has aged a lot more and he is trying to feel his inner peace as if his job is nearing completion. Now I added Shifu in here because he did contribute to the movie, as little of it as he was in. Shifu in KFP was a master to the Furious Five and Po, and only a master, but in KFP2 he is more of a father figure to them. He gives them the direction that he believes is best for them and the valley, and he is no longer intolerant of Po. When Shifu summons Po, Po interrupts Shifu's inner peace by stumbling and making loud noises, but Shifu just shrugs it off and guides Po to his next phase of training.Now for the final character which made this an excellent movie, Shen (Gary Oldman). Now this character was one of my favorites. In most animation movies you can look at the antagonist and he will be able to fit into society and not be a threat unless he/she wants to be, but from the very beginning he is just a fearful figure regardless of what he is trying to do. Shen shows the true antithesis of good by just being ruthless, unforgiving, and down right murderous. It does not matter what is in his way he will destroy it or get his minions to do it. That is one of the excellent things about this franchise, the villain was truly a villain. Like Tai Lung (Ian MacShane), he was feared by the Valley of Peace just by hearing his name, same with the name Shen, it just struck fear into the hearts of the people.These four characters really did add to the movie, but this movie also had everything built into it. Not only did it fill the previous holes from the first movie, where is Po from? Who are his parents? How did Mr. Ping get Po? All of these questions are answered in this movie, it is almost as if this is a prequel-sequel. It is as if the first movie was a rope with stray ends and the second movie weaved all the ends together to make it flow perfectly. Normally when I watch a movie I can find a few things that are just ridiculous, but I brush them off, not in this movie though, it was pure excitement, humor, and enjoyment throughout the whole thing. If you are debating going to see this movie, the decision should be to see it, well worth the money and well worth the time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Decent Sequel,"¨ My fist hungers for justice! ¨Po has returned to save China once again in Kung Fu Panda 2; with the same writers (Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger), but a different director (Jennifer Yuh). Many consider that the original Kung Fu Panda is DreamWorks's best animated film to date; in my opinion their best one is How to Train Your Dragon, but Kung Fu Panda was still a great movie. I had my concerns with the sequel because I knew it was going to be hard to meet expectations. Cars 2 failed in this respect for Pixar, but Kung Fu Panda 2 worked a little better. This film isn't nearly as good as the 2008 original, but for a sequel it works really well; it probably won't win an Oscar (Rango seems to have it pretty much locked up this year, although I didn't like it), but it is still very entertaining and the entire family will have a good time with this movie. The best thing about the film is the animation. Guillermo del Toro was brought in as the creative consultant for the Art Department and it really paid off because the look of the film is impressive and so are the visuals. The story is actually the weakest link, but it works mostly thanks to the characters we grew to love in the first film. There is also an interesting villain, voiced by Gary Oldman, so that was also a plus, but the story was really predictable. After the first 15 minutes you knew exactly what was going to happen at the end. Jean-Claude Van Damme also has a small role as the Master Croc, and it was fun to hear him.Po (Jack Black) is living in the temple with the five kung fu warriors he has always idolized since he was little: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross). They seem to be training very hard as we hear Po breathing very heavily, but they are actually all staring at how many breads Po can fit into his mouth. Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) calls for Po and tries to teach him about finding inner peace. Po is more of an action kind of Panda and is waiting to show off his kung fu skills as the Dragon Warrior (title which he achieved in the first film). His opportunity comes when the Village where his father Mr. Ping (James Hong) lives is attacked by a group of wolves who are stealing all the metal from the village. The wolves are gathering metal in order to create a secret weapon that will put an end to Kung Fu. They all work for the evil White Peacock named Shen (Gary Oldman) who is threatening to conquer China with this new powerful weapon. There is something about Shen that bothers Po and reminds him of his forgotten past. Po begins to have flashbacks about his childhood and discovers that Mr. Ping is not his actual father. Along with his friends, Po begins a quest to stop Shen before it's too late, and at the same time discover the truth about his past.Kung Fu Panda 2 is not as fresh and fun as the first film, but it still was a lot of fun. Po is really a fun character and one can't help but be reminded of Jack Black when watching Po trying to do his kung-fu stunts. Po is not only voiced by Jack Black, but he seems to be inspired by that character. In the same way there is a scene where we see Master Croc (voiced by Van Damme) do one of his singular moves from his action films. Jack Black is an incredibly funny actor and we find some of that comedy in Po's animation. Gary Oldman also brought a lot of things to his new character, and he is always great at playing the villain. Kung Fu Panda 2 might not be as good as the original, but that doesn't mean you won't have fun with this family friendly film. My only complaint relies in the story, but the animation and visuals make up for it. Kung Fu Panda is a fun film you can enjoy with the family, but not much more than that.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
An emphatic return with a darker story; great movie with lots in it for the adults as well,"The question that has been floating around about Kung Fu Panda 2 is if it is Shrek 2 or Toy Story 2 of animated sequels? Well, I'm happy to say it's Toy Story 2 kind of animated sequel - a genuine good movie that takes risks and succeeds rather than rehashing the first movie.Po isn't as much of a gastro-kung-fu fighter and fanboi from the first movie but has grown in his personality; he's less the Jack Black as a panda and more of a character that stands on it's own. However, Po is now the tragic hero in a Greek style prophecy which foretells of a warrior in black and white who would defeat a certain Lord Shen who has invented a new weapon that could spell the end of kung-fu. As Po learns that he is adopted, he struggles to find out about his past and the strange symbol from his nightmares. The heavy subject matter doesn't weight down the movie and is continually and cleverly able to escape into funny moments without losing gravitas. It successfully weaves the topics of fatherhood, friendship and family into a colorful story that even though we know how it will end, it gets there very very emphatically.I'm really glad that Kung Fu Panda 2 didn't go the route of being a purely children's movie and didn't go the route of being built on jokes of Po's eating and Po's weight. I suppose the fortune cookie philosophy of master Shifu is slightly missed but purely a small quibble in a good movie. As a final note, maybe it's because of my eyesight with a weaker left eye, I barely noticed the 3D at all. Highly recommended movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not as great as the first, but still fun never the less","I have never really liked anything Dreamworks animation had to offer. Call me crazy, but I'm not the biggest fan of Shrek or Ice Age. That is until i saw 'Kung Fu Panda'. Something that was worthy enough to challenge the ranks of PIXAR. I can only expect more great things to come from this series.What made the first film work was a combination of things. Obviously there's the depth, humor, and amazing character development. But what really sold it for me was the progression. The progression of the main character 'Po', and him discovering that everything can be special. It was a beautiful thing to watch unfold on film, and it really tapped the nerve of Chinese philosophy. My main problem with this film was how it didn't follow the same progression. Sure it had those deep rooted elements. But i felt like it was lacking just a little more heart.Now i'm not saying that this movie was bad at all. I did enjoy it. But i've already seen what these writers and actors can do with a subject like this. So needless to say, it wasn't as epic as the first.However, the movie is worth the watch. If you do get the chance, see it in 3D, because this is certainly worth the couple extra bucks. But aside from the visuals, the characters are all still fun, the action sequences are fun, and there are some portions of the story that will damn near break your heart.Bottom Line....the storyline still does have that deep Chinese element to it, which i really love. But it's not as eye widening as the first. I still had a good time, and the ending did kind of leave me excited. If you loved the first one like i did, i think you'll have a great time watching this one. But in my opinion, the first was way better.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"No replay value. Flat, Predictable, and Charmless","Some characters voiced by famous people were barely used (especially the snake, monkey, and bird). I didn't see the first movie, but they just seemed like baggage that couldn't be cut. I feel bad for David Cross getting about 3 lines and none of them being comedic. This was an all star voice cast, and it was mostly wasted.There was no emotional build up in the plot or development of the characters. It just stumbled through a series of henchmen fight scenes. You knew how the movie was going to turn out in the end. In fact this was one of the most predictable movies I have ever seen. Let alone the plot, scenes, and character types we've seen 100 times before, I found myself predicting the ends of the characters lines way too many times. There was no charm to this movie. Compare to a Pixar movie, they both use clichés, but Pixar films are actually remembered. Nobody in this film really had a developed personality besides Jack Black's character.Visually, the entire film seemed to be colored an ominous red and gray. It made for a very uncomfortable movie as the whole thing looked like it was over a fire. Compare to Mulan, where there were scenes in the white snow or woods. That was visually memorable. Who cares about the good CG animation, its like buying a 3 year old expensive crayons. In addition I was confused by the purpose of a lot of the non-kung fu action scenes. I felt like I was watching a video game someone else was playing. They went on for forever. I was later told this would normally be in 3D, makes sense. These scenes are time filling garbage.Review was harsh, but honestly they created this for the quick cash so I don't think they care. This has almost no replay value and won't stay in your memory for long. It won't bore you to death or anything, I didn't have a bad time watching it, but something irks me when they pull movies like these out of a can and I come here to find it has a rating of about 8. That's on par with Aladdin/Fantasia and above Cinderella/Dumbo. Lets be honest, its about a 4.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Enjoyable family film that adds a bit of darkness, and a lot of scale, to the strengths of the first film","I'd not seen the first Kung-Fu Panda film since it had come out in the late noughties, and I hadn't seen any of the other ones at all until it my toddler started watching them and I picked up 2 and 3 for her. After watching the first one loads, I managed to move her to the second, for my own variety as much as anything else. The plot sees Po trying to settle into his new role as Dragon Warrior, at the same time as a banished son returns to the city to use a new powerful weapon to seize control of the city and country. It has a slightly darker tone than the first film, because it touches on Po's backstory, and it carries itself with more dramatic sequences than the first film did (where we only got to see the power and anger of Tai Lung in a handful of scenes - mostly the film was about Po's training).This slightly extra weight adds to the characters and the narrative, and at the same time the scale of the film feels bigger as we move into a city, with the stakes high. This means the action sequences feel like they mean more, and in return the actions is bigger, more polished, and fits well with the gravity-defying excess of the genre that the film is referencing and drawing from. It did this well in the first film too, but here it feels much more satisfying in the scale of it all. At its heart though the film remains funny, entertaining, easy for families, and with good moral messages throughout. As with the first film, the use of Chinese culture swings from mostly feeling well used and cleverly adopted, to being a bit cheap - but mostly it works well.Animation and production is of a very high standard, and the voice cast is even deeper than in the first film, with people like Oldman, Yeoh, Haysbert, Garber, Van Damme, and McBride joining an already very starry cast. Black doesn't always work for me, but he keeps Po funny but likeable, while Oldman manages to bring gravity to his performance and have good comic timing too.In my mind, the Kung-Fu Panda films were sort of 'lesser' films because I always saw Pixar's deeper content as being superior to Dreamworks stuff, however this second film lifts from the already good first, and is a very enjoyable and satisfying family film.",,Anonymous,Animation
Good Movie But Po's Antics Becoming Annoying,"While I didn't enjoy this movie as much as the first its still a good movie (especially as far as sequels are concerned).The animation, like the first, is great eye-candy making it a joy to watch while the general plot, villain, and personal back story's are all well done.Po's history is tied in well to the main plot and leads to some nice moments between Po and his noodle dad. Even one of the Furious Five shows some emotional vulnerability (setting up for the third movie of a planned six so I read). So this movie, like the first, delivers on the personal/emotional side pretty nicely.As for the main villain this go-round (an albino peacock), while less physically imposing than his predecessor (Tai Lung), he uses his wits to present a unique set of challenges to our heroes which leads to another one of the franchises unorthodox final battle sequences which I enjoy. Some might be disappointed, but I found him to be very majestic and formidable in his own way so I thought he was a nice choice.My only pet peeve is in the humor department as for me it lacked a feel of spontaneity and flow. Rarely did it catch me off guard like the first movie did so no LOL moments. Instead it was often predictable, over-the-top, out of place, or just flat out not funny. Sure there were some scenes like Po on the roof giving his speech (minus his bad overacting after the hat toss) etc that brought back memories of the first, but quite a few others had Po behaving so childishly or trying too hard to be funny that I began to find his antics a little annoying. Running around ""yeah lets go woo yeah!"" got old quick for me and a lot of his one liners felt like that person who you meet who isn't funny at all but for a need of attention continually tries to be anyways. Even one of the Furious Five looked tired of it as there is a scene where Po is talking about his two-step plan and Tigress has to reply with an agitated ""Po!"" as if to say ""okay we get it, but its not funny...knock it off already!"" I felt your pain Tigress.Still an overall enjoyable movie. No reason to not watch it unless you absolutely hated the first.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Furry, Ferocious, and Fun!","Furry, Ferocious and Fun!This Memorial Day weekend I watched Kung Fu Panda 2, the sequel to the action packed comedy starring Po (Jack Black) and the fearsome five. The first movie was a fun kids movie that had a lot of catchy one liner phrases, a few kick butt actions scenes, a lot of situational comedy, and a story that was about working hard and finding your inner strength. Now three years later, the fellows at Dreamworks have presented a sequel to this animal centered comedy, which follows after the two duds we saw in Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After. Is this sequel following the same path that the last Shrek films took, or does it shine on its own? My answer to this question is that it does indeed shine on its own.The story starts out with a background story about the villain Shen (Gary Oldman) and his lust for power to rule over China, eliminating any forces that try to stand in his way. Not long after the introduction, Po and the gang come back into the picture before Po is called to Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) to learn about finding inner peace. However, the peaceful air is soon disturbed by a pack of wolf soldiers and an action fight sequence soon starts that puts most action movies to shame. As the wolves retreat Po, along with the fearsome five, set out to defeat Shen and find inner peace.Over the course of the journey, Po provides that classic comedy that made him famous in the first film as he uses phrases like awesome, so hardcore, and freaking in providing that awkward and childish enthusiasm that makes him stand out. His enthusiasm is still balanced out by his lack of stamina and large girth comedy which is cleverly integrated into both combat and non combat scenes. Clumsiness also plays a role in Po's ability to make us laugh, as what starts out as the stylish moves of a kung fu master quickly turns into a blundering mistake that somehow seems to work for Po. All of these aspects are brought together by Jack Black's voice work as he finds a way to bring a juvenile tone to the comedy, while still sounding wise and honorable during the serious scenes.Perhaps one of the strongest aspects about this movie is the balance of story, action, and detail. The story, or should I say stories, are detailed enough to provide character development that older audiences will like, but at the same time is catchy, simple, and fun enough to allow younger audience members to get a gist of what's going on. The integration of action and chase scenes keeps the pace of the movie going while also keeping the attention of the audience glued to the screen, a plus for those that have a hard time sitting through a movie.What really brings all of these strengths together though is the camera and musical works that add that finishing touch to the movie. The camera work is smooth and not really jumpy and allows one to see what's going in almost every scene. An exception to this style occurs in some of the fighting seen at the end, but it's not too bad so most should be able to slide ignore it. While the camera's capture the action, the music that plays during every scene has been selected to bring out the emotions of the scene and make you feel it deep in your heart. Whether it be fast flying punches, sad flashbacks, or the findings of inner peace and the acceptance of the past the music catches all of these emotions in a brilliant combination of strings, percussions, and other orchestra instruments to make you feel like you are in the movie.Although this movie has a lot, and I mean a lot of good aspects, there are still some weaknesses that one may find. The comedic styles of Po can get a little stale at times, especially hearing the word hard core about ten times. A second thing is that Po pulls off a little too much Yoda at some points in the movie, I won't say too much more to avoid ruining the movie. Perhaps a third thing one might not like is how long it takes to finish off the final battle. Although the movie is only an hour and half long, some might find the final battle dragged out a little too long and want it to just end, this was not a problem for me however.Overall Kung Fu Panda 2 is a sequel that is a must see, especially for kids and fans of the series. Even if you haven't seen the first one yet, which was the case with my cousin, one will be able to find some part of this movie to enjoy. Laughs, actions, drama, story, and heartfelt emotions are all in this movie and the wide appeal to many audiences makes this a great movie for a youth group or friend outing. Thus my Robbie Rating for this movie is 9.8-10.0. I hope that you enjoy this movie as much I did. Recommended audience members: Kids, Dreamworks fans, Kung Fu Panda lovers, action lovers, comedy lovers, etc. People who should avoid this movie: Horror fans and fans looking for a movie with blood, because it doesn't have any of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I'm the only one or few who like better Kung Fu Panda 1 & 3!?,"The third movie Kung Fu Panda 3 reminded more and especially relived memories and feelings for the first movie Kung Fu Panda and the villain Kai at least looks more scary as a bull and was against pandas as Shen too.The reasons why I dislike Kung Fu Panda 2:
1. I especially didn't like there was too serious and dark theme at the same time for lighthearted, funny, non-serious and innocent characters as Po who are just especially one of my most favorite characters.2. There are more plot holes.3. It's focusing more on the Furious Five.4. The villain Shen is a killer rabbit villain who looks less scary as a peafowl, even though he was just responsible for Po being separated from his family and killing his mother, but Po let go of it a little too easily and was happy even before he knew it and/or after since he had no experience of it.The plot holes:
1. It seems first Shen wanted to weaponized fireworks because he was power hungry to conquer China as he was a evil psychopath, his parents was worried about him because of his evil nature and tried to kill all pandas too make sure the prophecy about a warrior of black and white as pandas would stop him to conquer China wouldn't come true, but other source says Shen wanted weaponized fireworks to impress his parents and business of Gongmen City at first. How can Shen become power hungry to conquer China because he wanted to weaponized fireworks or his parents exiled him who had nothing to do with China, kill all pandas if Shen didn't want to conquer China at first and believe his parents would be proud of him for killing all pandas and conquer China when they weren't even evil too and even let his cannon crush him if he want to conquer China anyway? Shen would at least get his will to conquer over a kingdom since he was at least a prince who are the only heir after his parents to conquer over their own kingdom, usually royalties who have and are jealous of their older siblings who are the next to rule over their kingdoms and advisers who dislike their job or never get any praise and honor, become power hungry and will only conquer over their own kingdom instead of entire country or the world that have nothing to with them. How could Shen believe his parent would be proud of him to weaponized firework and conquer China if his parent weren't evil too? Would Shen want to take revenge on his parents? It were his parents who banished Shen because he want to conquer China and massacred pandas, but why did Shen still want to seek revenge when his parents was nevertheless died before his return?2. Why did Shen want to make an end of kung fu? Even Shen was a kung fu master too, kung fu had nothing to do with his backstory, his main goal was to conquer China and kung fu could be useful to conquer China. Shen created a cannon that would put an end of kung fu, but it's not only kung fu it should make an end of if there are anything else are as powerful or more powerful than kung fu, as chi.3. The kung fu masters seems more weaker. How could the kung fu masters believe even only one cannon could put an end of kung fu and conquer China and didn't even knew first that Shen at least had more than one cannon and could create multiple cannons quickly that they should rather stop him from doing instead and how could even Po believe a cannon figurine was Shen's actual cannon when and didn't even laugh just because of it was too small too put an end of kung fu and conquer China? Aren't kung fu masters smarter, too quick and has high strength to hit the cannons and wasn't there other more kung fu masters than just Po, Furious Five, Shifu, Storming Ox and Croc who could also go to stop Shen if they needed more help? Cannon is too slow and heavy to swing fast enough and can only shoot on one place at once if there are more kung fu masters than cannons and are in different directions, even Tai Lung was shown to be cunning and swift enough to avoid firing weapons and was able to defeat the Anvil of Heaven, the Furious Five and Shifu on is own, Tigress hit the cannon down to the bottom floor of Tower of the Sacred Flame, Kai easily defeated many kung fu masters by taking their chi on his own and Thundering Rhino didn't even dodge the cannon's fire. Shen must at least have kung fu skills and learn his wolf and gorilla army kung fu to defeat kung fu masters, Kai and Taotie could make an end of kung fu, Kai easily defeat many kung fu masters by taking their chi on his own and once Taotie created a machine that easily defeat Po, Shifu and Furious Five (without Tigress). Why didn't Thundering Rhino try to dodge the cannon's fire and how could the other kung fu masters survive blow from the cannon when Thundering Rhino who easily dies of just a one blow by the cannon when he was bigger and stronger? Po survived probably because of his enormous body fat. Wasn't most important to stop Shen from conqured China than to stop him to put an end of kung fu?4. Why is Thundering Rhino's physical appearance different than in Kung Fu Panda Holiday? Why is shown in the credits of Kung Fu Panda 2 Po made the the Furious Five action figures when he was a child if he was fan of kung fu since he was a teenager and the Furious Five were just formed then as revealed in Secrets of the Scroll?5. Why is not even shown or mentioned that Shen began his plan years before or it was lesser than 30 years ago for the panda massacre and when he was exiled if it was 20 years ago as revealed in Kung Fu Panda 3?",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Po's Fist Hungers for Justice, I Hunger for More Po","""Kungfu Panda 2"" is an excellent sequel to an excellent preceding film and a truly fun film to experience with your family and friends. It is as enjoyable as watching through the first time, maybe even better. Here, the elements from the first film are improved and crafted for this sequel to create a wonderful, stunning, and memorable adventure that will surely entertain all its audiences and leave them hungry for more Po.The plot of this movie is much more enveloping than that of the first film. Po, now the Dragon Warrior is a hero protecting the citizens of China with his fellow friends, the Furious Five, as well as his master, Master Shifu. But then, a threat endangers all of China as well and threatens the existence of Kungfu. This threat is organized by the peacock, Lord Shen, who is after the destruction of China, and the extinction of Kungfu. Now Po, the Kungfu Panda, with the Furious Five, are determined to stop Lord Shen from destroying China and the existence of Kungfu, despite that Lord Shen has designed a very powerful weapon (something like a catapult). But doing so takes Po into learning the truth about the past, about who his parents are, and about who he is.""Panda 2"" is also the first ""Panda"" film to be shown in 3D, which wasn't quite bad. Depth was practically conspicuous throughout the film and is certainly not a bad choice in how to enjoy this film. ""Kungfu Panda 2"" is definitely a film worth watching in 3D.With a more threatening premise, and the addition of 3D, ""Panda 2"" also improves on the action scenes. The fighting scenes were very entertaining and should keep kids and adults hooked.The animation movements and CGI in ""Kungfu Panda 2"" are also excellent and awesome. The backgrounds, and the setting are all very detailed and the complex movements of the characters are simply perfect. Bravo!Another element welcome to the ""Panda"" movies is romance. In this movie, Po will start to have a relationship with another creature (No, I won't tell who he had it with). Speaking of relationships, the movie will also get emotional as Po begins to discover the truth about his past.Humor plays an essential role in this film and will leave you laughing in your seats. I think the jokes here can give you more laughs than the jokes from the first film. ""Kungfu Panda 2"" will definitely keep you laugh your head off.Apart from all these, I was also amazed in how they could use a peacock as a skilled martial arts creature. At first, I thought, how could they use a peacock, full of feathers, as a martial arts villain. Then ""Kungfu Panda 2"" revealed it all and I was stunned by their work in crafting a feathery bird, into a dangerous, and ruthless villain.In terms of recommendation, I would recommend this movie to all ages. The humor will appeal to little children, as well as older audiences alike, and the fighting scenes will appeal to teenagers, or and older audience. 3D is definitely worth it for experiencing this film.After analyzing the box office performance of ""Kungfu Panda 2"", I feel pitiful for the movie, especially when Dreamworks have crafted a wonderful and amazing film for audiences to enjoy. I do hope that the box office performance of the film rebounds and becomes a great hit in the box office world. I also do hope that this movie will be successful enough for the sake of ""Panda 3"".So yes. Po's fist hungers for justice. But I hunger for more Po!Prince AJB's Rating: 10/10 (Excellent)Thank you for reading my review on ""Kungfu Panda 2"". I hope my review is useful for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"no more than OK - slow, flat writing, nice visuals","I thought it was OK, but no more than that. The writing wasn't very much inspired. There were no amazing jokes, no good story twists and no exciting action sequences. The plot (Poh embarks on a mission to both discover who are his real parents and defeat the inventor of gunpowder, which would make Kung Fu obsolete) unfolded exactly as we expected, but it unpredictably felt very slow at traits. The characters, although funny, are flat in a way that Pixar characters never are. Tigress is perhaps the most disappointing with some 10 lines in total (With so little, she is not even a supporting character: just a dramatic trick for making the story advance.) Poh's traditional laziness seems a bit of an old joke here. The visuals are however beautiful, and the idea of showing Poh's faded memories in 2D is quite cool.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Good, not as great as the first but highly emotional.","Worst sequel. Storyline just meh. Worst villain after rewatching the triology. Action scenes were underwhelming, same animation style as the original.My least favorite of the trio. At least worth watching, i guess. Lack in action (first movie have many great action scenes). Lack humors and comedic scenes compared to the first but one thing for sure, this movie have better emotional attachments value. Its all about family and friends value, including fostering parents. Not a fan of the simple villain, of all animals why peacock? Weakest villain indeed. Lack screening time for sensei this time, glad that the furious 5 members didnt get faded away to the background.

"Full of of ""Awesomeness""","Kung Fu Panda was huge in every sense, $631 million at the worldwide box office and an indelible character amply voiced by Jack Black. This is a voice role that may come to define his career, even though he does not actually appear in a single frame.Understandably Dreamworks Studios would be failing shareholders not to expand the franchise further and we now have the second film, in what almost certainly will become a trilogy.Does the film suffer from mid trilogy bloat and irrelevance, well actually no. Everything is subjective but this is the equal or may even surpass in some ways, the original film.Po Ping or Dragon warrior (Black) managed through his daring deeds and hopeless optimism to save ""Kung Fu"" in the first film, here he has a much harder task. Finding himself, reconciling his own adoption and achieving ""inner peace"" all the while fighting off the genocidal Lord Shen (Oldman) of Gongman City. Shen is intent on destroying everything and everyone to fill the emptiness, due to a lack of paternal love.As Po would say, ""It's like, quite deep"".As before, Po manages to complete daring feats and heroic acts, not so much out of bravery but by falling skillfully, more often than not led by his ample stomach in search of a quick feed. He does not do this alone of course, we have on hand his usual fighting crew. Tigress (Jolie), Monkey (Chan), Mantis (Rogen), Crane (Cross) & Viper (Liu), heavy hitting star power for a children's animated movie.We also have Shifu (Hoffman) returning as a ""Yoda"" like mentor and Mr Ping (Hong) as Po's adopted father, who provides comic relief and some touching scenes in equal measure. The film tidying up the slight oddity of a Panda being the son of a Goose. Michelle Yeo voices the soothsayer that predicts Shen's future, who may or may not be useful to his quest in equal measure. Even Jean Claude Van Damme gets a look in as Master Croc, which always looks good on your filmography.It goes without saying that the animation and sound are top rate and the story unfolds in a natural way and does not feel conceived merely to extend the franchise. We wanted to know more about the character and here we explore Po's past and why this new threat is so personal and debilitating to him, his own Kryptonite if you will.What made the previous film really stand out was the hand drawn oriental style animation that interspersed the action, fleshing out stories told by the characters. Here we are again treated to similar sequences which lift the film to another level. For every child friendly chase sequence there is a tender scene which manages to appeal to adults without detracting from the on screen colourful antics.Will Po manage to vanquish evil again, find balance and reconcile his past, well the deviations from the norm can only be stretched so far but the journey is the thing and there is much to enjoy along the way.Could well be the the best animated film of the year, Pixar have definite competition in this genre and perhaps mirroring the arc from Toy Story 1 to 2. If so, then the third outing could be special indeed.SummaryEqualling or even eclipsing the first film this achieves all the studio could have hoped for. Family friendly with a good heart, exquisite animation and a starry but well used voice cast.Highly Recommended and as the tagline says, ""full of awesomeness"".",,Anonymous,Animation
Not as fun as the first one but OK,I took my grandson to see kung fu panda because I really enjoyed the first one. This one unfortunately is not as fun as that one but it passes. The animation again is stellar and Jack Black again does a good job as Po. I am going to disagree with the critics the story is coherent and both stories (Po's search and the peacock's) do work if you are intelligent enough to see it. What I found irritating though is that it seemed to go on longer than the 90 minutes. I think it was because on like the first one it took too long for the Po to get it. Also the fight scenes were way too long and draw out for me. Yes the kung fu was good but it seemed to go on forever. The movie did redeem itself in the end and that's why I gave it 7/10.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Nutshell Review: Kung Fu Panda 2,"Who would have expected Kung Fu Panda to become a surprising, heartwarming summer hit back in 2008, where I thought it had captured the very essence of a typical martial arts film, and distilled it into an animated piece appealing both to kids and adults alike. The big risk involved is of course coming up with the inevitable follow up film given the profits that it had raked in, that won't be an insult to its fans, and yet maintaining that same level of appeal the original had. Kung Fu Panda 2 succeeded.Although it certainly did seem that passing the reins over to rookie director Jennifer Yuh was bewildering, but Yuh turned out to be perfect in guiding the sequel and the beloved characters in yet another adventure, with bigger set action pieces, touching dramatic moments, and retaining plenty of humour from the get go. Credit of course must go to writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger in coming up with a natural progression of the story of Po (Jack Black), and filling it with a lot more elements from classic martial arts film formulas such as a jail break involving skilled pugilists in captivity, a pagoda, getting beat down, recovery and recuperation, and the learning of a new, ultimate skill. To think that the worries came from the scribes being responsible for the snooze-fest Monsters Vs Aliens, and Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.Kung Fu Panda 2 brings back the A-list voices of Black as Po the Panda, now very much comfortable in his celebrity role of the prophesied Dragon Warrior, and the Furious Five consisting of Angelina Jolie as the no-nonsense, hard hitting Tigress, Seth Rogen as the wisecracking Mantis, David Cross as Crane, Lucy Liu as Viper and the underused Jackie Chan as Monkey, recognizable animals used in distinctive martial arts boxing styles. Also returning are Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu and James Hong as Mr Ping, while joining the fray are Gary Oldman as the chief villain Lord Shen the vain peacock, Michelle Yeoh as The Soothsayer, Jean-Claude Van Damme as Master Croc, Dennis Haysbert as Master Oxen and Victor garber as Master Thundering Rhino, the latter three forming some formidable masters of kung fu whose city they're protecting falls under siege.The story continues to loosely adopt from historical developments in China, with the premise being set during the time when gunpowder was discovered and fireworks created, but with the more sinister use of the material also for the creation of weapons such as the cannon, threatening the extinction of martial arts with its formidable firepower. Lord Shen becomes fanatical in plundering metal from the land with the ambition to rule all of China, but for his Soothsayer to predict his downfall to come from something black and white, hence his dogged massacre of pandas with his wolf pack goons, before setting his sights on and signaling his diabolical intent on some legendary martial arts masters.It's pretty amazing how this under 90 minute film also managed to squeeze in plenty of pathos in the form of Po having to unlock his repressed memory of being necessarily abandoned by his parents following a pattern ala Moses with the pandas being threatened with forced extinction, which provides tons of baby panda to milk some scheming, crafty moments to tug at your heartstrings, and you can hear that audible gasps of ""oh so cute""s from female members of the audiences. Well done, if the studio decides to make money from merchandising. Narratively it's pretty predictable following the generic essence of typical kung fu film classics, what with the learning of inner peace and new skills involved that resembled very much like Taichi-quan, but what mattered of course is the delivery that hit expectations, and not buckle under that same weight brought over from a successful first film.Then of course there's the spectacular fight sequences, especially when Po and the Fearsome Five combine to protect the innocent masses against hordes of enemies that come with the requisite comedy, from slapstick to lyrical, like poetry in motion when they showcase their respective, distinctive moves. Big action set pieces are well designed, and I give my thumbs up to how the villain is modelled after the peacock, which in itself brings about the theme of vanity that almost all villains possess, but in the context of kung fu, it's extremely smart to design Lord Shen to move and utilize his own innate weaponry, that of sneaky darts and fans - a weapon that in Chinese martial arts film, is the weapon of choice of the ""wei jun zi"" - the ""fake gentleman"" (sorry if my interpretation sucks, but you get my drift).No qualms about this installment, I would put it in my highly recommended list as a sequel that didn't forget about the spirit of the original, and if the filmmakers can continue to capture exactly what makes martial arts movies tick and distill it like it did for the first two films, I dare say we're in for a mighty strong franchise that will appeal to kids, and every kung fu film fan out there who will probably go nuts at how well this animated series managed to get the formula right.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Power of Awesomeness,"In a summer packed with superheroes, pirates, and aliens, I wouldn't have guessed that my favorite movie so far would involve animals doing martial arts. Kung Fu Panda 2 was extremely impressive.The Po (Jack Black) of the first Kung Fu Panda is still the same goofy panda with a strong spirit and unique karate moves, but in this movie he faces unanswered questions about his past. While the first movie was more of an origin story, the sequel shows his quest to find out where he came from, a gap that he needs to fill in order to become at peace with himself. If you wondered how a panda could be the son of a goose, your questions will be answered, and Po's backstory is much more emotionally developed than you might think.Po also has to confront the villainous Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), an albino peacock. Tai Lung (Ian McShane) in the first movie relied more on brute force, but Shen is much crazier and unpredictable. In typical supervillain fashion, he plans to take over China and destroy Kung Fu forever (yes, Kung Fu is treated pretty lightly in these movies, but there's enough philosophy involved, and it is a kid's movie). Though Tai Lung held a personal grudge against Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) in the first movie, Shen is a more fitting antagonist for Po because of a strong connection to Po's past.And of course the colorful supporting cast is back too. The Furious Five are all well-designed characters, and although they don't have much speaking time, they all have their moments to shine (especially Angelina Jolie as Tigress and Seth Rogen as Mantis). Though Jackie Chan barely had any lines. The new characters all help to expand the world of the movie.Though the first movie had a lot of juvenile humor, Kung Fu Panda 2 had a lot less fat jokes and a lot more slapstick. Despite the marketing, Po only says ""Skadoosh"" once, and it's actually pretty cool. The movie is darker overall, but that only serves to increase the epic tone. Shen is played by Gary Oldman, and though I didn't realize that until the credits, it makes a lot of sense. The villainous peacock is very similar to other self-obsessed, off-the- hinge villains Oldman has played in movies like León and True Romance. But however dark the movie gets, it's always a lot of fun. Jack Black isn't as annoying as he can be sometimes because Po just seems like the kind of character he's meant to play.The animation in Kung Fu Panda 2 is extremely well done. It's incredibly cool to see the group fight as a team, and the character animation is expressive in both emotional and action scenes. The cinematography embraces a wide variety of techniques, from slow motion to first person chase scenes, and several sequences use 2D animation to great effect. The set pieces are action-packed, and entertaining. After one scene, I thought the movie was going to end soon just because of how big it was, but the real finale topped even that. And the landscapes and backgrounds are beautiful to look at, artfully designed but still realistic.I saw this movie in 3D, and for the first time, I definitely recommend it. I haven't had many good experiences with live action 3D, but animation is much better suited for it. Kung Fu Panda 2 is a thrill ride, and the 3D was crisp and well done.I have to give props to Hans Zimmer. After Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides was a bit of a letdown, the soundtrack to Kung Fu Panda 2 is quite awesome, adding to the already epic tone.I honestly can't think of much that I can criticize about this movie. Po's ""this is awesome"" comments get a bit repetitive, and some scenes with Shen are a bit long. There's a plot point where the group and Po have an argument that kind of doesn't make sense. Otherwise, this movie was really entertaining, both as an action movie and a (admittedly aimed towards kids) comedy, with a strong heart in the center.If Cars 2 doesn't completely blow everyone away, Kung Fu Panda 2 definitely has a rightful chance at winning Best Animated Feature (which my brother jokingly called ""The Pixar Award"") this year. It's interesting to see animation take on different genres, and if you took out all the animals, this movie could definitely stand on its own as a kung fu epic. Dreamworks really stepped up its game, and I would gladly pay to see Kung Fu Panda 2 (maybe even in 3D).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Nice, but wearing the curse of the sequel","Sequels are almost never better then its originals. The Bourne Ultimatum and Kill Bill: Vol. 2 might prove me wrong, but those are more like final parts of a three- or two-part story, so it is true anyway: sequels rarely beat originals. And so it is in Kung Fu Panda 2 as well.The animation is breathtaking, the humor very fun, the kung-fu action extremely stylized, the story fine and morally educating to children as the original Kung Fu Panda, but it is still a tiny bit worse. But it is nothing wrong with that. As i have learned from watching many sequels, i expected it to be worse and Kung Fu Panda 2 is still a very fun, spectacular movie for children and adults of all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Packs twice the punch, in every way!","Let me preface by saying I was rather unimpressed with the first Kung Fu Panda. As entertaining and well-choreographed as it was, it didn't pass my bar for mediocre DreamWorks animated movies. It was amusing and had some heart, but all-in-all was pretty expected. Now when I got a chance to see a preview of Kung Fu Panda 2, I was rather indifferent to seeing DreamWorks trying to pump out a mediocre sequel and a new franchise. But WOW... was I wrong! I take back everything I said earlier because, man oh man, I have to admit that Kung Fu Panda 2 was one of the best animated films I have ever seen.In in this installment, we find Po and the Furious Five defending the Valley of Peace from evil when a new threat rises. Lord Shen, an albino peacock banished by his parents many years ago, has returned with a technology capable of ending kung fu and conquering China. As the Furious Five embark to destroy the weapon, Po begins to realize that Shen may be linked to his lost childhood past as a panda bear. I won't say any more in fear of spoiling the story, but be prepared for a powerful emotional experience.I found a big improvement was that they toned down all the things that made the first movie irritating: over-the-top Jack Black antics, overused slow-mo effects, and dialogue silliness. That's not to say Kung Fu Panda 2 doesn't have humor; actually, it has exactly the right amount at the right time. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot at the jokes in the first movie, but the sequel had me (and the whole theater, for that matter) genuinely laughing! The characters have fully matured and been fleshed out to the point where even Jack Black fits comfortably as Po, though regrettably the Furious Five barely get any screen time. Of course, shining in the spotlight was Gary Oldman as the sinister Lord Shen, whose fantastically evil voice acting tops even Ian McShane's as Tai Lung and is the ONLY way that a peacock could possibly be made scary! The 3D was also showcased quite well, enhancing most of the visuals throughout the movie without being a headache.Maybe you call it blasphemy, but the comparison must be made. Kung Fu Panda 2 was put together with such a degree of excellence that it rivals many Pixar movies (and in my opinion has a good chance of outshining Cars 2 this year). With some fantastic animation, a surprising and touching story, and convincing voice talent, Kung Fu Panda 2 will easily go down as one of my all-time animated favorites.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Still too much Jack Black in so-so film,"A few things can definitely be recommended about ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" in 3D and none of them have anything to do with Jack Black. Overall, the film gets mixed grades.The artwork, the visuals and computer graphics are simply stunning. The production team gets a tip o' the Dodgers cap. Seriously, it's the only reason to see the movie.Having just raved about the visuals, it's got be be said that at least 10 minutes of the bombastic kung fu fight scenes could easily have been cut.Why? Because it was nothing but ridiculous overkill, i.e., filler to flesh out a weak and mostly empty script so that the studio could deliver a 90-minute film & justify charging $10-15.I read that star Jack Black is taking credit for re-writing much of his part. Ten-year-olds loved the results. I'm not sure that many over-10-ers did. Face it, the real Jack Black seems to be nothing more than a big overgrown 10-year-old, so it figures.Not being a fan of his, a little Jack Black goes a very long way for me. I pretty much think that the guy is minimally talented & basically one of the luckiest, most fortunate people in Hollywood. I do not get his mega-fame.BTW, John Powell & Hans Zimmer's score stands out in several places.As for the rest of the big-name cast, octogenarian James Hong as Yoda and Gary Oldman as the chief Blue Meanie are darned good.However, the rest just don't stand out at all. You could tell me that Jean-Claude Killy voiced Master Croc, not Jean-Claude Van Damme, and I wouldn't have known the difference.The story & script: Since this is so obviously a kids flick, why did writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger get so deep into the philosophy of finding peace that was what the whole movie was about? This plot went nowhere with the kids I went with & talked to. It was way over their heads.No, overall, ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" was a hodgepodge of good & bad. Good visuals, stunning even - and bad everything else.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A journey with a deeper matter for Po, would you join him?","Since the past few weeks, there has been quite a lot sequels popping up in the box office with a large number of mixed feedback from all fans. Most of the jibber jabber can be just thrown out of the window since most ""FAILED SEQUELS"" are at present bringing in the big bucks at the box office. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is an original. Entirely different plot goes a wee bit sinister I would say. The mild violence works. I recall just being 12 and watching ""The Lion King"" and I loved it when the hyenas were torn to shreds by Simba. Well that was on good old VHS and this time it's in 3D. Po and his friends are entrusted on a task to save Kung Fu from being wiped off the face of the earth by the Evil Peacock Shen. Shen who has daddy issues has built a new weapon, which is no match for Kung Fu, or so he thinks until our famous panda warrior goes soul searching for inner peace.Heartwarming it was not, as it were in 2008. It was more on the sides of slick action and an immense amount of war. This took the movie to an all new level and it took the movie away from temple and noodle shop. This works at times. But I believe the winner and the bestselling angle for this is definitely the well-crafted fight sequences. I watched it in 3D and it was off the hook. It's the exact kind of thing that would wow a young kid, or even at times adults like us. The way they introduce Shen as the evil Peacock and the way Shen fights, the moves and his amazing feathers just nailed it! A lot of thought seems to have gone into the animals they bring into life in ""Kung Fu Panda 2"". Hats off for all the creativity.Jack Black & Dustin Hoffmann so far are my favorites. They are sharp and always on the lines so hard that it's impossible not to laugh. By no means does this imply that Jolie, Chan, Rogen, Crane, Liu were over shadowed. I just felt that some of the best lines just happened to have just gone by their way.Although it has PG rating just like before, this is a wonderful movie for kids and adults alike. The Panda, whom most of us have already begun to love, will tug at your hearts again (Specially the females) and take you on a beautiful journey.

Simply Awesomeness!!!,"This installment of Kung Fu Panda exceeded my expectations in all respects.Animation is superb, characters greatly orchestrated, voice-acting is top-notch, fights are well choreographed and there is enough humor to make you feel that you have regained your childhood back!!! With ingenious methods, the actions scenes are executed. And in many parts where you would normally expect a punch line or superb dialogue, there will be an excellent goof-up which seems to tickle you just enough!! Kudos to the dialogues and screenplay.The only negative (and that too a little one) is the storyline. I really expected something other than the plain old story of discovery and revenge.But all-in-all, Kung Fu Panda 2 is one of the best animation movies ever made and I can safely say that this will be the best movie this summer!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
waste of money....,"I could not enjoy this movie at all. In the first movie, every next scene came with its own surprise, fun and adventure. But in this sequel, many a times things did not make any sense. On one hand, Panda defeats the enemies with his super kung fu and on other hand, he cannot give a single punch to the tigress. I think it was a failed attempt to make Panda funny, which ended up making him look rather stupid.I went to the movie with great excitement. Only 3 people including me showed up for this movie. I wish I had not spent money on this. I am giving it 6 stars for the few funny scenes it had and overall work done to make this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Chan and Van Damme together in a film at last!,"'KUNG FU PANDA 2': Three Stars (Out of Five)Jackie Chan and Jean-Claude Van Damme together in a film at last, even if it is just as voices (hopefully they'll do an 'EXPENDABLES' film together next)! The rest of the all-star voice cast, from the original, returns with Chan as well including Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, James Hong and Jack Black as Po (the 'Kung Fu Panda'). New voices (besides Van Damme) include Michelle Yeoh, Gary Oldman, Danny McBride and Dennis Haysbert. This time the film is directed by Jennifer Yuh, an Art and Animation Department vet but first time film director. It was written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger (who also co-wrote the first film). The movie is not quite as much fun as the original (which wasn't a great film to begin with) but it does deliver the laughs and action fans expect.The first film dealt with Po living out his dream by joining his kung fu heroes, 'The Furious Five', and becoming the chosen 'Dragon Warrior'. In this chapter he struggles with coming to terms with who he really is and where he came from (now knowing that he's adopted). While battling his inner demons he also must lead 'The Furious Five' to face a new enemy with a weapon that destroys kung fu. Of course he won't be able to conquer this new found enemy and deliver peace to his people until he finds peace within himself. To do this he must discover the secrets of his past.The movie is just about what you'd expect from a sequel. If you're a fan of the original you'll probably enjoy this chapter as well, just not quite as much. Black and the rest of the cast are funny, a lot of the jokes are of course silly and geared at kids but the film has a decent amount of laughs to deliver a slightly older crowd as well (like the first). The action scenes are entertaining although I heard from my two young nephews (who I saw the film with) that the movie is too scary at times and much more frightening than the original (I personally didn't notice). Guillermo del Toro was an executive producer and creative consultant on the film this time around and some say he added a darker tone to it. As I said I didn't really notice much of a difference in that way from the original but I'm sure that could be a slight possibility. The movie is fun regardless and should please most fans of the original.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr4LOQxrmg",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hardly worth the money,"Well, the story is just dull. I simply find it as normal as it gets and totally predictable. The fact that Po just simply find a way to realize the marshal art by 'thinking' about it and call it destiny is none-sense. For any marshal art, the worriers need to practice and maybe in older age, they will find inspiration so they can realize the true arts and have the break through. Otherwise, you are some kind of genius and very suitable to practice marshal art and learn something from special scroll or something, then you can learn the true art. In the first movie, at least ShiFu somehow find a way to train Po so he becomes strong in the end. Still ridiculous but acceptable. In the second story, that part of the story is just so thin and Taichi just suddenly fall in onto the lab and he becomes the master of it OK, if you just simply for a laugh and try to watch the cute panda, it is OK. However, what you have not seen in the second movie that is not in the first one? The story is not funny anymore, Panda is the same as before and the whole thing really just rushed all way to the end. The parents-son relationship is pretty thin as well. I really enjoyed the first movie and now I find the second one a disappointment. Again, watch in big screen may give the movie a few positive point and really no point to watch it again on small screen.5 points for the average effort.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Inner peace..,"There was so many ways the sequel could have been much worse but DreamWorks certainly surprised me with this movie.Solid story with likable humor and themes that were just as deep as the original. The characters are decent. They open up some new details on them mainly for Tigress and Po but well they sure do a pretty good job on it though. The antagonist was a bit cliche, I mean a fallen prince and all that but was not bad. And lastly the visuals and the music were fantastic.Overall an enjoyable film.Memorable:No Rewatchable: Maybe..",,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda 2,"Saw this one in 3D version at the cinema (4th time this year, after RIO, THOR and Captain Jack Sparrow), my expectation was not too high as I was in a numb state of receiving bombarding Hollywood summer momentum, a yearly-recurrent compulsory course (my sole anticipation lies in X-MEN: FIRST CLASS right away).It turned out that the exotic appeal is roughly null to me (thanks to my Chinese identity), and confidently I can claim that I do prefer RIO after comparison. The Zen-inspired quintessence of the story is all-age beneficial but superficially indoctrinated and without any originality inside, the gags and set pieces are ample but in lack of a punchline. I find the editing is clumsy at some time and thwarts the coherence of the whole picture. The shadow play is a nice trick which makes amends for the corny plot of memorizing Po's provenance.A fully-fledged exploitation of Kung Fu and panda is foreseeable, nevertheless this time no improvement from its precedent, the original cast is on a stable level and new characters like evil peacock Shen and the goat Soothsayer all fall into flat.The 3D effect work much better with animation than other SFX-padded live-action blockbusters, but I think an IMAX 2D could be a better choice. Due to its lukewarm North American box office, if the red-hot 3D trend will be put in a halt or a slow-down, I will be happy to see it (Although very probably the international income will eliminate this idea for the film companies).",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than the original,"Now that is not to say the original Kung Fu Panda is a bad movie, actually it is a very entertaining movie and one of Dreamworks' better films. It's just that I preferred this sequel, I felt it had more heart and energy although the first film is not at all devoid of those qualities.My only slight quibble with Kung Fu Panda 2 is that I think it could have been a tad longer. Other than that as a sequel and as a film, Kung Fu Panda 2 is an excellent film and ideal for the entire family.The animation is absolutely stupendous. The backgrounds are so colourful and rich and the characters are all believable in facial expressions, movement and how they're designed. Also the action sequences are both riveting and fast-paced and Hans Zimmer's score has a lot of flair and rousing and energetic themes to it.Kung Fu Panda 2 has a lot of energy. Not just in the likable characters(every single one of them has a personality and are delightful to watch) and crisp pacing, but also in the sharp and hilarious writing and fun and heart warming story.The voice work is superb across the board. Jack Black and Dustin Hoffmann stand out among those who return, and I liked how Po and Tigress'(nice voice work from Angelina Jolie) relationship is further explored here, but overall the standout was Gary Oldman who is absolutely brilliant as the villain Shen the Peacock, who happens to be of now my personal favourite Dreamworks villain because he is actually given layers in alternative to being the standard villain you love to hate.Overall, a great film and better than the (entertaining) original film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Kung Fu Panda 2,"Po (Jack Black) returns in another kung fu animation adventure which sees our ever hungry panda face up to a new and devastating threat in the form of angry albino peacock (Gary Oldman) Lord Shen. Having been cast out by his parents years before for his atrocities, Shen has been biding his time returning with a new technology that threatens to enable him to conquer China.Po is joined once again with the Furious Five as well as a few new characters to try and save not only the local people but also the very fabric of kung fu and all that it stands for. Aside all of this, we also learn about the childhood of Po and how he came to be at the doorstep of Mr. Ping (James Hong) and his noodle restaurant. This film definitely takes on a darker feel when compared to the first and will surely give the younger kids in the audience something to keep them awake at night. It also has more packed into its story with extra depth and variety than the first did not necessarily have ie. lineage and upbringing and the effect that has on us as adults.The animation is fantastic and despite not hitting the heights of a Pixar movie is up there with some of the best that I have seen to date. My favourite scenes are the fighting scenes in particular one where they are assaulting Shen's stronghold. The combination of action with the impressive visuals drags you right into the fight alongside the characters.Po can get a bit annoying/repetitive at some points as the Jack Black from within is released and a torrent of 'awesome' and similar such catchphrases are rattled off one after the other but this did seem to be toned down slightly from his usual self so I began to think of Po as Po rather than Black in a panda costume.I think this is a case of the sequel running the original very close and I would be hard pushed to say which one I preferred. Whereas the first was original and purely a kids flick this builds strongly on the first opening it to a wider audience with more of a slapstick feel to it which has me just siding with this one as the better of the two. Why don't you make up your own minds as it's definitely worth a watch on the big screen.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A isolid sequel to a solid kids film.,"It may seem a little bit similar to its predecessor and has many silly scenes. But this sequel more than compensates those flaws. It brings in great animation to the solid world created. Giving us a lot more action to make it even more interesting than before when it opts for the comedy. Not to forget, there is a lot more heart and emotion that really give it a great amount of humanity. A isolid sequel to a solid kids film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stunning,"This film is so beautiful. The storyline has more emotional impact, the characters have strengthened their relationships with one another and this time we get to see them being supportive, teasing each other, and working fluidly. I like the detail of Po's dreams being in 2D and more cartoonish/unrealistic, but as he starts to accept his past and works on inner peace then the dreams become 3D and more realistic as they become proper memories.The animation is again marvellous and I love the small details of each characters, such as when the light hits Po's fur and the hair on the edges get lighter. Each frame of this film can be hung up on a wall, the lighting, shadows, textures, reflections are amazing and the team should be very proud of themselves for producing this high quality creation.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Panda vs. machine?,"This is one of those sequels that doesn't continue a story but still manages to be successful. Kung Fu Panda has a plot that is so concise and well made that you cannot continue the story. You can however create a new story within the universe and do so with wonderful development of characters you already know and create one centered around the concept of man vs machine. The cast and writing is just as good as the original but it still feels like a sequel. This franchise could have been a solo film and I think that it should have. However, after seeing the first one, the sequel is luckily an animated film worthy of attention.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Lacking Tension and a believable villain,"I gave the first film an A+ because the story and characterization matched Jack's humor perfectly. This film falls far short mainly because it lacks any real tension at all. In the first film, Po has severe tension with all the main characters--good and bad. The conflict between Po and Mr Ping his Dad, Po and Master Shifu, Po and the Fantastic Five, Po and Tigress, Po and his eating dysfunction, Po and learning Kung-Fu was severe and superb. All the tension was excellently crafted and laid the foundation for humor to release the tension at just the right times. Ian McShane's Tai-Lung was a far better villain and the tension between them was excellent. This sequel could have created a new type of tension with all the characters. Perhaps there could have been treachery within the Fantastic Five(or just perceived treachery), or perhaps a severe misunderstanding with Shifu. But no, instead the story writers gave very weak tension between Po and Master Ox and Croc and minor tension with Po saving China from the evil Shen. The Wolf Boss and wolves, nor the Gorillas were ever perceived as on Shen's side or even a threat, really. The writers even included a fortune-teller that ruined ANY tension between Po and Shen and the eventual outcome altogether. Very anti-climactic. The story about his adoption was touching, and the only reason I gave it a 2 instead of 1.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The search for origins serves as a dramatic artifice, but as fun it works only as a cue for the third segment, an open conclusion that makes evident the need for a new film","If the script is not the main weapon, the direction pays off (in part), with a breakneck pace that turns the feature films into quality passenger entertainment. And that is what the second part of the panda bear saga is: above all a pleasant pastime. Giving little space for the spectator to breathe, the animation is sustained by excellent action scenes (which are beautiful in the face of live-action works of the genre), without forgetting to include hints of charisma in its protagonist, a characteristic that stands out thanks to the mild but sympathetic drama displayed.Screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger from the original film return to write the fun story of the new film. They follow the narrative line adopted by many screenwriters who write the continuation of their creation. Usually the first film has less action, but with the presentation and development of its characters. In this case, the opposite happens. Lots of action, deepening in the protagonist, in the supporting and in the new antagonist and introduction of new characters. Fortunately, the film's writers managed to escape a disaster by the very simple, yet very captivating narrative. Extremely agitated with numerous action scenes that excite the viewer, but also has satisfactory developments in some characters. Po is the most developed during the film. With their narrative arc, the writers elaborate the famous ""teardrop blow"" - it is necessary to have a heart of stone not to be moved by the tragic origin of the panda or the fantastic relationship with his adopted father, Mr. Ping.In addition, the suggestion they send to viewers is quite significant. They address the current extinction of pandas and adoption in a very succinct way, which is often seen as a frightening act by many people. The script also has opportunities to mature the essence of the protagonist, but at the time H uses a slapstick joke, returning the immature clown look to Po, which is very disappointing for the viewer eager for unprecedented, not renewed attitudes. Other than that, the narrative body is very similar to that of the previous film in which Po's objective was to be accepted into society, to awaken the spirit of the Warrior Dragon and stop Tai Lung. In this film, he has the mission of discovering his origins, finding the desired Inner Peace and defeating Shen. But he is not fooled by the recycled structure of the narrative. Despite this, it has completely unique and original moments.Kung Fu Panda 2"" is not an animation that aims to surprise you from a narrative point of view. But it is by accepting its limitation that the film becomes quite efficient, proving that the formulas, when worked well, still work. Aibel and Berger deliver a correct script, without big holes, betting on justified and meticulously measured action, never tiring the public's eyes, balancing each of the action scenes (and how beautiful the choreographies of the animals fighting!) With good pinches of physical and also verbal humor, which will make children (and adults) laugh in the rooms. But the film is not only about struggles and fights. There is also a dramatic arc, a new ritual of passage for Po, who, after discovering his inner strength, now has to discover inner peace, as Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) teaches him.The script is also clever when looking for a sensitivity in Po's life story that decelerates, even in moderation, the rhythm of the plot. The great flashbacks add an extra dose of drama and ""cuteness"" to the film, in addition to deepening the protagonist's beautiful relationship with his adoptive father. The option gives even more charisma to the panda bear, which continues with jokes and comical phrases at the end of the book.The script is also clever when looking for a sensitivity in Po's life story that decelerates, even in moderation, the rhythm of the plot. The great flashbacks add an extra dose of drama and ""cuteness"" to the film, in addition to deepening the protagonist's beautiful relationship with his adoptive father. The option adds even more charisma to the panda bear, who continues with jokes and comical phrases on the tip of his tongue, as well as an incredible ability to destroy plans and pay for monkeys, even if some sound too childish. Much of the film's originality comes from the new characters. Lord Shen is the most unprepared antagonist I have ever seen. The peacock is hysterical, insecure, desperate and cowardly living on the verge of a nervous breakdown, many of which are caused by the hilarious Chief of the Wolves, the villain's ally. The other welcome addition is that of the Gypsy goat Falamacia - a vital character in the evolution of Po and Shen's narrative. Even the brief Master Rhino manages to lift the public's spirits in his few minutes.While Po is fully developed, his side-kicks are completely overlooked by the script. They are involved in the story to help the protagonist and serve as comic relief. With the exception of Tigress, the other four furious - Heron, Monkey, Mantis and Viper, are only allegorical. The film's comic content is extremely high - it is impossible to leave the session without having a good laugh. Loaded with irony and surprise elements, the jokes are clever and very well handled mainly for remembering that the film is actually a fable. In other words, the protagonists are talking animals and, with that, the script takes the opportunity to create jokes about the nature of the animals.Some characteristics of the previous film return to the sequence, the main one being the conservation of the inhabitants of the Valley of Peace. It is a very discreet joke that few will notice, but the rabbits, ducks and pigs that give life to the city - are typical dishes of Chinese cuisine. - again, irony is present. The historical setting is also very interesting, enriching the plot. Gunpowder was created in China during the Han dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD). He also takes the opportunity to subtly quote Yin-Yang. Despite the many qualities, the script has extremely cliché elements. The greatest example of this is the history of the origin of Po. In addition to the clichés, he has the frightening predictability of his climax - with just eight minutes of projection he already knew how the film was going to end. This completely crumbles the charm and entertainment of the final act. There is a tremendous flaw in the middle of the projection that is frightening. In the meantime, heron visibly breaks its wing and asks for help from friends. In the next scene, he is already flying in full splendor. It is for these reasons and the disregard for the other characters that the film sins and declines its remarkable quality.Director Jennifer Yuh (who replaces Mark Osborne and John Stevenson), in her first experience in the theatrical role, is given the main responsibility. And she fulfills her with immense talent. From the very first minutes we are already surprised with strings of struggle that squander creativity, which are not afraid to drink from the source of true oriental productions. To our happiness, they remain until the last minutes of projection, exploring the whole of Chinese territory, ranging from hectic pursuits to clashes full of explosions and mysticism.As if that were not enough, Yuh still has an art department that is not only technologically well-endowed, but also visually committed and engaged, putting together scenes of great photographic beauty, which explore red in all its potential. The task will prove to be more difficult than anything they have ever faced, because at each meeting of Po with Lord Shen himself or his minions, he undergoes a blackout, which is closely linked to his past. The flashbacks that come out of these blackouts use a second animation technique, closer to traditional 2D, but still full of style and following the Asian aesthetic of an anime of economic movements.All other scenes are made using the most advanced computer graphics available. And how well it works combined with stereoscopic 3D in action scenes. If there is a film that deserves an extra expense to be seen in 3D this year, it is certainly this Kung Fu Panda 2. All the sceneries of the Chinese plains that were already beautiful in the first feature were even more beautiful, the water (quite important in the third act) is incredibly realistic and the traces of the animals, although they remain the same, receive more details than the eye can capture. It is amazing how much technology has evolved in such a short time, just three years.Finally, we must say that Kung Fu Panda 2 is a fun movie that deserves to be watched, especially by those who liked the first movie. If this is not your case, Kung Fu Panda 2 doesn't really have that many additions to make the series gain new fans. The search for origins can serve as a dramatic artifice, but as fun it works only as a cue for the third segment, an open conclusion that makes evident the need for a new continuation.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Awesome CGI animated sequel with superb kung-fu fighting that is very entertaining to watch,"This is probably one of my favorite CGI animated film. It is very close to being good as the original. The story just wasn't as gripping as the original and the development of the characters wasn't as good. But what this sequel does have is way better action, in fact it has more action than the previous movie. Watching this movie was like watching a Americanized CGI anime or something. The build up isn't as great this time, it's okay but not great. But when the action kicks in, you just can't help but be amazed at how creative and entertaining the action sequences are. The main flaw of this movie is the pacing, it just seems kinda off but that is only a very small complaint. This is a movie that kids and adults will enjoy while watching. I had a blast seeing all the awesome fight sequences. This really felt like a legit kung-fu flick that kids can watch and have a blast with. Right after the movie was over I wanted to watch it again to see the action sequences all over again. Yeah some people judge a movie by the plot the most, the plot here is okay. But c'mon it's a CGI animated kung-fu flick and for a kung-fu flick this movie was awesome. I highly recommend anyone that like fighting movies or even CGI animated movies to check this movie out.

"""Panda 2"" loses power in 2nd half","Rarely,some sequels gets good in the first few minutes and then, it loses its magic throughout the rest of the film {take ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" and ""Batman & Robin"" for example}. Well, Dreamworks's ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" gets it and it handles it with less irony and a little wit.In this sequel to the 2008 computer animated hit, Po the panda and his gang of heroes try to save China from his parents's old nemesis,an evil peacock named Shen.Jack Black returns as the voice of Po, and he gives the film its touch of laughter. He helps makes Po the Axel Foley of Animation. Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen and Dustin Hoffman are also back respectively as Tigress, Mantis and Shifu but this time, they are all a little bit underused. Gary Oldman gives a fine performance as the film's villain, Shen, but is close to other great villain performances such as Ursula and Scar. Also good is Michelle Yeoh as the voice of the Soothslayer.Jennifer Yun Nelson handles her first film both a little slow and fast at times. Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger's script acts sometimes as an 3-part episode of a 90's animated Saturday morning series running for 90 minutes. The animated effects {both in 2-D and in 3-D} are not as eye-popping or great in the first but it still good.When I saw it in 3-D, It was good for the first 25 minutes, but during the rest of the time, I began to feel restless and taking off my 3-D glasses twice.

Po's backstory was never explored in the first installment, which left it wide open to explore in a sequel.

But kudos to the filmmakers for not restingon their laurels and coming up with a moving story, where Po has to confront buried childhood demons.The good news is that the film is funny, entertaining, and moving. A scene or two really tug at the heartstrings. There are some cool new characters voiced impeccably by Gary Oldman, Michelle Yeoh and others. And the old favourites do well too. And, like the first, the film is respectful of Asian culture and martial arts.The downsides are pretty minor. Shen's WMD (actually many of them) is a bit goofy, but provides a nice set piece at the end.

The contrasting red and black colours with the colourful ones in some scenes is very creative and also gets cinematic points from me, but I felt like the scenes eventually got repetitive due to lack of environment change.7/10: Tries to do more than the original and succeeds on many levels on creating a darker sequel that thrills but losses some of the humour that made the first so lovable",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good animated sequel from Dreamworks!,"This is a Dreamworks' animated sequel to ""Kung Fu Panda,"" a story about noodle-shop worker-turned Dragon Warrior Po Ping, a giant panda. He joins elite Kung-Fu group the legendary Furious Five -- Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey -- in protecting his home and the Valley of Peace. However, Po and the Furious Five learn that the treacherous Lord Shen of Gongman City is threatening the valley with a new weapon that threatens to end Kung Fu. While battling memory flashbacks of Lord Shen, Po attempt to stop Shen and learn the truth about his past.Like its prequel, the film has the action, tense and adventure of any martial arts-themed movie.

New to the cast are Gary Oldman, Michelle Yeoh, Dennis Haysbert, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Victor Garber. Oldman gave a menacing, dark and crafty voice performance for Lord Shen and Yeoh gave a motherly, yet wise and eloquent voice portrayal of Soothsayer.Like its prequel, this movie's animation and visual effects capture the many beautiful characteristics of China including Shen's magnificent pagoda tower and the boat where the climactic battle takes place. Jennifer Yuh did a great job directing a movie with courage and power, but with darker tones than the previous film. The writing team of Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger provided another daring story with enough action and adventure to keep the movie exciting, but with a darker and suspenseful subplot that gives the film an intrigue twist.

"Kung Fu Panda 2 excitedly kicks, punches and belly flops its way through overused visual humour.","""Everybody was kung fu fighting!"" much more so in this sequel when compared to its predecessor. The Furious Five were slapping Shen's army of diabolical wolves left, right and centre. Master Shifu prodding his stick conveniently during the climactic battle. And a plethora of other anthropomorphic beasts harnessing the power of said martial art. This very much felt like an animated martial arts feature, one aspect the original was sorely missing. However, despite DreamWorks' best efforts in continuing Po's search in becoming the Dragon Warrior, its quality offers no improvements. Unable to surpass the boundaries of family-friendly humour that reduces the visual splendour and narrative heft to progress the story onto the next level.Po, having realised who his parents truly are (not a goose...), must save China with the Furious Five from the malicious peacock Shen and his fascination with metallic weapons. DreamWorks constantly pump out family orientated animations with powerful morals every year. This sequel illustrating the ability to manipulate our past childhoods to shape the person we want to be. For Po, this meant ignoring the familial scars that Shen caused, producing his prepubescent abandonment. A notable moral that many should abide by, but unfortunately is weighed down by excessive comedy that diminished a vast amount of beautiful moments. Aside from the tantalising scene when Po finally discovered what happened to his parents, conveyed through mesmerising hand-drawn animated flashbacks, all other heartfelt examples were brutalised by Po's apparent requirement to exercise his bumbling personality. Black's prolific voice doesn't help matters, with a lack of sincerity to his vocal performance, but the frantic pacing and rushed sequences made for a frustrating central narrative.That's not to say this sequel is poor, in fact it's just as consistent as its predecessor. Rather infuriating is all given the tender bamboo seeds that were lovingly planted, unable to grow into ferocious stalks. The humour, as overwhelming as it is, does provide characterisation to these animals. Po in particular. Making it hugely accessible for all members of all families to watch and enjoy.The action sequences were splendid and vibrantly colourful, with some ingenious editing that made one chase scene resemble 'Pac-Man'. The oriental aesthetics and environments built a beautifully inclusive world for the characters to roam in. The antagonist, Shen, was far more memorable and sinister in comparison to...ummm...I forgot his name. The snow leopard? We'll go with that. Mostly due to Oldman's vocal work that has a larger range than the entirety of his filmography (and that's saying something!). The red and black lighting was, at times, excessive in depicting ""evil"" and surprisingly dark. No, not thematically. It was literally difficult to see anything!Aside from that, Kung Fu Panda 2 slaps. And punches. And kicks. But also tumbles repetitively due to Po's constant buffoonery. It does however set the third film up nicely, so guess I'll have to give that a go...",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda 2,"Kung Fu Panda 2 was produced by Dream works Animation Co. The stream line of the movie is about the relationship between Po (panda) and Lord Shen (peacock). On one side Shen has the dream of making a deadly weapon using which he can take over China and on the other side Po, who wants to be the best Kung Fu warrior, realizes Shen was responsible for his loneliness. Thats it!These days most animations have the same story. Most of the time there are black and white sides and the whole story is about one side overcoming the other. Nothing new! I myself am sort of getting bored by these kinds of scenarios. Dream works should seriously look for richer contents. Animations like Spirited Away (A masterpiece animation from Japan) could be a very good shinning model for Dream Works Animation Co. to retain their audience appeal. They seriously need to follow such artistic works with richer and more powerful content if they want to make things work again or else they can try to continue with their older better productions like Chicken Run(2000).Above said, there is however one very nice and emotional scene in Kung Fu Panda 2 which I like the most, and it is when Po remembers his childhood and the way he lost his parents. Such eye-catching visual effects and dreamy colors were used in these scenes.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bruised Knuckles and Feet.,"Kung-Fu masters led by the titled character (voiced by Jack Black) must join forces to fight an old enemy (a deranged peacock voiced by Gary Oldman) who has created a new weapon which threatens all which is good and right in animated Asia. Much darker and heavier than its predecessor, ""Kung-Fu Panda 2"" feels like it is somewhat forced as the movie gets into flashbacks and chaotic action sequences which sometimes become distracting to the warmth and complexities of the key characters involved. A bit on the scary side for really young age groups and not quite as compelling to older viewers, the movie is still successful overall but lacks the magic of the first. It also leaves the door open for more sequels by its finale. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Animation
The power of awesomeness is abundant in this really fun sequel that is superior to its predecessor.,"I wasn't a big fan of the first Kung Fu Panda and found it ultimately boring though I described it as mildly entertaining. I was persuaded to give Kung Fu Panda 2 a try by my friend and to be honest I was willing to give it a go even though I was quite sceptical. But surprise and behold this was a really great sequel to the first, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I felt that much more effort was put into this and a result it is much more entertaining. The story itself was better with more in-depthness about Po's past, the animation was far better visually then the first one with the 3D being quite impressive. The action was choreographed better and more exciting to watch with the voice-over being great from the likes of Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Gary Oldman (Shen), Jackie Chan and Seth Rogen. But Jack Black was the revelation as Po who bought even more charm to his character. However for me Gary Oldman as the voice of Shen the villain Peacock stole the film and was superb and made quite a menacing villain for a kids movie (plus funny too).Two revelations though that made this sequel a high rating as I gave it of a seven was the fact I came to care more about the characters in this, particularly Po and the fact the script was much wittier than the first with more comedy that was actually really funny at times. The best bit for me though being when Black says as Po as he holds his fist up. ""My fist hunger's for justice."" His stomach then rumbles for hunger and he pauses and says. ""That was my fist"" had me in fits of laughter.I know I was quite critical of the first one, but I really enjoyed number two and this is a animation the whole family should enjoy. I would happily see this again for enjoyment and hope for the first time there will be a Kung Fu Panda 3. The Power of Awesomeness was completely lacking in number one but slams into drive for Kung Fu Panda 2.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
AMAZING. Better than the first one.,"I don't usually like sequels because they fail to capture the magic of the original. Kung Fu Panda 2, however, was INCREDIBLE--or should I say AWESOME? It's even funnier than the first movie--but that aspect I expected. What I didn't expect was for it to be as emotionally moving as it was. It's embarrassing, but there were portions that had me tearing up as much as the five-year-old next to me. Overall, the sequel lives up to the first movie and even manages to exceed it in terms of the level of depth of its message. True, the kung fu parts (which are even more abundant in the sequel) are a big portion of Kung Fu Panda's appeal, but what makes it memorable is the message it's trying to convey. I'm going back to watch it again as soon as I'm done with this review.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A poignant and action-packed sequel,"""Kung Fu Panda 2,"" directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson, is a worthy sequel that balances humor, action, and an emotional storyline. The film follows Po (voiced by Jack Black) as he continues his journey as the Dragon Warrior, now facing a new formidable enemy, Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), who threatens to conquer China with a powerful new weapon.The animation is stunning, with beautifully choreographed fight scenes and vibrant, detailed backgrounds that bring ancient China to life. Jack Black's performance as Po remains endearing and energetic, while Gary Oldman's portrayal of Lord Shen adds a layer of menace and complexity to the villain.The film delves deeper into Po's backstory, adding emotional depth and exploring themes of identity and inner peace. The Furious Five, voiced by an impressive cast including Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, and Jackie Chan, provide solid support and engaging interactions.While some plot elements are predictable, ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" excels in its character development, visual spectacle, and heartfelt moments, making it an enjoyable and meaningful experience for viewers of all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Manages to be at level quality with the first film.,"Continuing the adventures of Dragon Warrior, Po the panda (Voiced by Jack Black), the next phase of his training to become a master of kung fu is to attain inner peace. But he can't seem to reach that state. He's conflicted after he finds out that he was adopted as a baby, a truth he learns of after repressed memories finally come forth. On top of this, the disgraced peacock prince Lord Shen (Gary Oldman at his intimidating best) has taken over Gongmen City with a deadly weapon that threatens to destroy China and Kung Fu, and if Po and the Furious Five can't stop him, Shen will accomplish his dark goal.The first Kung Fu Panda was a really good movie. It opened in 2008 to high critical praise, and to become a smash hit at the worldwide box office. Kung Fu Panda 2 improves upon a lot of the first film's traits, but falters in other ways, basically keeping both movies on a nearly even keel.The movie covers familiar grounds to those who liked the first movie, and you can detect the clichés of other, better animated movies, but the movie makes up for those things in many ways. A common demise for sequels is that they just keep adding more pretty visuals, more action, and more characters, but fails to give the story proper development, thankfully Kung Fu Panda 2 is not a movie that succumbs to that.It never loses sight of putting heart first, and continues to properly develop character, and explore sides of them never before seen. Another plus is the incredible voice cast, specifically Gary Oldman. But it is worth pointing out that the jokes in this film weren't as funny as the jokes in the first film, and I feel that one or two action sequences had a bit too much slapstick, but those are only minor gripes. I also thought that the film's third act was really exciting.It may not be perfect, but it's still a decent movie, so I'm gonna give Kung Fu Panda 2 **1/2 out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good for an afternoon watch,"Not having seen the first film I'm unable to define how bad or good this one connects to it. From what I do know of it, the lead character is still pretty much the same - thinking with his belly, not completely help- and clueless but almost there, but still a hero. Either way this film starts with an old enemy of Po rearing its ugly head and Po being called in to protect the citizens from him.Story wise there's nothing too fancy about this film - it's all been done before. It doesn't affect the film negatively though, it's an animation film designed to please kids and their parents and it does that.Animation wise I must say I was pleased by the colour scheme. It gives a radiant hum. The details in the background are just high enough as well, and the added 3D effects aren't wasted (though they can be missed without missing out on anything of the film).The character development may go a little over the heads of the kids - but I didn't see any of that bother the kid I had with me. So, all in all, enjoyable for kids and parents.7 out of 10 Pandas behaving fiercely",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011),"Same disappointing effort as the first. This time Po must face some demons from his past and discover his inner peace. Once again it is the villain that really impresses, with Gary Oldman getting all the best material. His voice is everything an antagonist needs to be. Calm, sinister, with a certain ounce of charm. The flashbacks are represented in what looks like 2D hand drawn animation. These segments have more depth and emotion than anything else in the film. By this point even Dreamworks' capable skills look tired. Why concentrate so much on the hairs on an animals face when you can't even build up some believable camaraderie between the Furious Five. If at any point I'd believed these characters were in danger I may have actually given a damn about the action sequences. A few jokes work, baby Po is cute, but I can't really recommend this.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Doesn't have as much punch as the first, but still good","This movie seems to fall short of the previous film like most DreamWorks sequels do. The studio seems to make entertaining original flicks, but they try to cash in on the fame of the first movies and overstuff the audience with weak follow ups. When it was announced that they were making a sequel to the first Kung Fu Panda it caught a lot of people of guard because the first movie ended well enough that it shouldn't have been a follow up. This movie tumbles short of creativity and freshness that the first movie had, but improves the action and exploring the world of Kung Fu Panda. The action in this film is top notch and very dazzling at times. It has more fight sequences that I would not expect in an animation film, but works quite well. It brings the movie full speed when flat moments arise. The plot of the movie is not as fresh as the first and seems to drag at times, but that's when the other elements start to come alive. The additional component that works well in this movie is the CGI. Its so well done and life like that you are pull visually to a new level. There are certain scenes that just had me stunned at how breath taking it looks. In addition to that, the 3D works well with the film and I believe DreamWorks studio does a great job of adding that portion into their animation films. Other than those various things, this movie has nothing else to offer. This movie in a way feels lazy at times as if the screen writers just start to throw things in the film to propel dull moments. The past animation characters and new ones they bring to the film do nothing to make their present worthwhile. They are mainly placed in the film to carry the story along for us to learn more about Po back story. The movie also tries to hit on an emotional level just as the previous film did, but seems to try too hard and fails at its task. Adding this extra feature is an attempt to connect with the older audience, but doesn't get plugged in all the way. This movie has enough distractions that keeps the flow of the film moving quite nicely for kids to enjoy, but older spectators will not be easily swayed like the first Panda movie seem to accomplish.",,Anonymous,Animation

"The big, fat panda kicks butt! Again!","If I could describe ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" in two words, they would be: Amazingly kick-ass. I was really in awe during all the fighting scenes. All of the action scenes (and when I say 'all', I mean ALL) were superb. They were easily the best part of this sequel.In ""Kung Fu Panda 2"", viewers are introduced to a new evil villain who is bent on controlling all of China. Po, along with the Furious Five, are set on defending the Valley of Peace from this menacing peacock who has created a very powerful weapon.Aside from the action and hilarity this sequel has, viewers now get to see the background of Po and how he came to be. That was a nice touch. The emotional impact was great and quite rare when we talk about films made by DreamWorks.This sequel will leave you satisfied, but still wanting more. When it comes to sequels, it's either a surefire hit or a sad, sad miss. Thankfully, Po and his friends did not disappoint with this film, although the original was still better. The first film was a lot funnier and had more continuity. This second film lacked those. But hey, the action scenes were excellent!

Spectacular,"Whilst not quite as well-balanced as the first film (perhaps because of the greater emphasis on spectacular action throughout - the the story doesn't build quite as effectively), this is such an entertaining film. It is stunningly beautifully animated, especially in its set pieces, which are even more ambitious than the first film. The music is once again wonderfully atmospheric. Whilst it would have been nice to see a little more character development from characters other than Po, this might have over complicated matters, and the film relies, quite rightly, on its slickness and pace to ramp up the drama. The story itself is well crafted, the villain excellent, and the finale is, strange though it may be to say it, one of my all-time favourite pieces of cinema.

"Less clever and funny, but a visual improvement and contains the same heart","Animated sequels have yet to disprove that timeless adage about movie sequels, but they're giving it a real go. DreamWorks Animation hasn't always gotten the formula right (the ""Shrek"" movies got worse and worse), but even ""Madagascar 2: Escape 2 Africa"" had entertainment to offer. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" marks the studio's third try at extending a franchise, and from a production quality standpoint its their best effort to do so.No, ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" doesn't outdo the original, especially not in terms of humor, but it improves on the visual mastery of the first, which was strong to begin with. The action sequences in particular still have no rival to this series. Director Jennifer Yuh stays true to the winning combination of action, character development and heart that made the 2008 original a success.The story works well, but its predictability holds the film back. The original offered a lot of surprises in telling the story of a fat and lazy panda who learned he could be great if he put his mind to it. In this movie, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) tasks Po (Jack Black) with another seemingly impossible mission, one in which the film's narrated introduction sequence already foreshadows his success. Sure, kids won't know the difference, but it zaps the film of any excitement for the rest of us.The story takes Po, the now infamous Dragon Warrior, to Gongman City, where the three kung fu masters that protect the city have been ousted by the villainous peacock Lord Shen (Gary Oldman). Shen was exiled by his parents — who once ruled China — because he had a fondness for turning fireworks into dangerous projectiles. Years later, he uses these cannons to uphold his new reign, because not even kung fu can stop them. We'll see about that.The strong voice cast returns for the sequel and delivers. Black has simply become Po at this point he does it so well, and characters such as Tigress (Angelina Jolie) and Po's father Mr. Ping (James Hong) get more of a spotlight, albeit at the expense of everyone else. Oldman makes a terrific addition as the cocky peacock; he demonstrates some lovely dashes of insanity and Shen's facial expressions match it perfectly.On all accounts, the production value of this series has gone up in this installment. The film moves at a good clip and the action sequences have no shortage of wowing moments. Shen's fighting style is something to behold and the storyboarding of the film's first sequence when the Furious Five defend their home from Shen's wolves does not lack for ingenuity to say the least.Also at work in the film is a subplot involving where Po came from, as one must imagine he is not literally the son of a noodle-cooking goose. The answer to this mystery becomes clear from the moment the question surfaces.All the other aspects of the movie satisfy, but Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger's story possesses no creative energy. The choice to go with it was safe. Rather than venture too outside the box, ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" takes the cookie-cutter route. It looks good and it is good, but it doesn't meet the standard raised by its predecessor. Fortunately its dedication to character and heart make it stand taller than your average CGI-animated effort.~Steven CThanks for reading!

One of the worthier animated sequels that makes me excited for part 3.,"Hitting the ground running with a beautiful prologue using, I guess you'd call it cut out puppetry.Thus they establish a mission statement to not try to fix a formula that was never broken while still trying to give it a new sheen.The most memorable aspect of this movie is its antagonist. Having said that I think they wasted him a little bit. I don't mean that he doesn't get as much air screen time as he deserves, but they show us this amazing, charismatic formidable bad guy with a theatrical edge (wink wink) and he is so badass a part of me sort of wanted to route for him instead. Sadly they decided to commit him to the role of clownish villain when he could have been so much scarier. Again, it's not campiness that dampens it but that he is so blatantly an emotionally damaged character he starts to look pitiful when if they had had more of a feather touch he could have been an intimidating villain while maintaining a complex edge. In practice his motivations just seems abstractly about power but never mind.His back story is thematically consistent with Po (that's the panda) main problem: this movie is based around that old chestnut of the theme of belonging i.e. wondering who your (birth) parents are. The conclusions this draws are predictable and it can be hard to really relate to how much Po obsesses over biological relation.But fortunately this does not dominate the picture. You will quite feasibly want to watch this a few times for all the amazing visual detail with intensely impressive martial arts choreography and a sumptuous display of sinitic color. The score is unusually infectious for a Hans Zimmer score and all the laughs you'd expect are there with Jack Black in top form. The interplay of traditional and CGI animation is most effective and when it gets sentimental it almost brought a tear to my eye because they earned it.We also get to see Po's developing relationship with Tigress and the rest of the Furious get their moments too.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Jack Black is Back and Jackie Chan Can,"""Kung Fu Panda"" surprised everyone with how good it actually was. It's sequel now has the burden of expectations to live up to. Everyone now knows that this movie can be good, so it no longer has the element of surprise. So, does this film deliver the goods? You can rest well knowing, YES ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a superb sequel.An underdog sequel can be tricky thing to pull off. It isn't enough to repeat the same story, after the events of the first film, the character is no longer an underdog. Due to this fact, many film franchises make the mistake of undoing the hero's progress. This movie does not do that to Po. Po and the crew all remember the lessons they learned in the first film and actually ADVANCE their characters. This isn't like ""Mighty Ducks"" where the heroes just relearn the same lessons, they learned in the first film because, they weren't training in the offseason. This isn't a ""Megaman"" game where the hero got rid of all his powerups from the previous game. And that is so refreshing to see.The action in this film is some of the best animated action of all time. The comedy in this is very fast paced, a joke happening a mile a minute. But it still knows when to dial back and let a bug moment sink in. Some jokes are clever, and even their slapstick is really good. This movie had some jokes that I replay again and again just to have a good laugh.Their returning characters are good, their new additions voiced by Michelle Yeoh, Gary Oldman and Jean Claude Van Damme are all welcomed additions.If you liked the first film, this one is a no brainer, I highly recommend. If you are just a fan of good movies, this movie is for you. Rock on Panda!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Incredible FX and action that cannot match the spirit of the first one.,"I am so sorry to disagree with so many people, It seems I wasn't expecting the same as everybody else here.Kung Fu panda made me cry, there you have it, it was a story filled with profound teachings about life, Kung-Fu and full of meaning. The master turtle and Shi-Fu really made the whole movie shine and the good and sad moments were truly remarkable, that movie was a dead serious hit for me, it surely wasn't done just for kids, so I was so eager to see this one.Sadly, Kung-Fu panda 2 returns to the formulaic premise of Hollywood these days, our hero doesn't need more training so the lessons are replace with a very bad villain who doesn't know how to fight and then recurs to weapons (not my kind of villain).The tone of the movie is darker than the original, sadly, the mood, the way the movie is made and the way characters develop is it not. It's like they tried so hard to made it more serious than the first one, but the excessive action and special effects really contrived the movie to a merely two or three scenes of peaceful nature. There are so few quiet moments that it really feels like ""producers and execs"" told the writers, "" more fun, more action, more dark"" and this is what we got.I really don't know why people loved it, I hated it, not because it's a bad movie, because the first one was so deep, and this one so dull. Comparing this one to the first one is like comparing star wars episode 5 with episode 1, one is deep, the other is dull.My kids liked it, the increased action will have a positive feedback for people that don't have inner peace (clearly the majority of the market this movie goes for), but, for people that search some deep meaning to the things that happened on screen, they will better be served with Kung Fu Panda.Kung-Fu panda 2 excels at action but lacks heart, not giving us master Shi-Fu through the movie was a big mistake and the lack of a master like the turtle in the first one was a serious error me thinks.Tai-Lung was a glorious villain, the peacock no, it wasn't scary, it wasn't evil, it was just a resentful guy trying to be bad, also, what's up with dumbing down our dragon warrior?, after the first one this guy was a real master that defeated a truly difficult villain, in this one it behaves like a moron the whole movie up until the end?, it just doesn't fit and it was done purely for jokes and fun and it was forced.So sad that it turned out to be like this.My score 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
My old enemy - stairs,"This film jettisons the essential tone and message of the original, while retaining the superficial elements of the characters and setting.Having successfully manipulated the clichés of the mono-myth and countless references to action films into an original, funny and heart-warming masterpiece, the franchise loses its way with this dud. Here the writers become the tools of the story-we-all-know, every step predictable. Gary Oldman plays (as usual) the villain with a thousand faces, flawlessly, yes, but that's the problem. There's no humanity in the peacock to make it interesting. Only Dennis Hopper can project a villain less sympathetically. James Woods or Jeremy Irons? You know the type.Where is the REAL Jack Black? David Spade, Jay Baruchel, or Norm Macdonald might as well have voiced this cartoon panda with as vivaciously. The rest of the cast follow suit. Gone is any sense of play. The characters just plod along in the ruts left by countless re-tellings.The one good line in the film indicates what's wrong - up and down the stairs every hero story follows - one step at a time, skipping few (there's no panda princess locked in the tower). It's just boring!And then the ominous threat of another cliché-driven sequel tagged onto the end. I sincerely hope the franchise-holders reevaluate what they're doing, and resuscitate the life of the original, rather than clone another simulacrum to stagger blindly two hours.",,Anonymous,Animation
"enjoyable,but nothing special","This is not typical action film because it is comedy.And because the main characters are funny animals-fighters.The first Kung fu panda is excellent.Expectance was big and I think the second part fulled it.My opinion:this is crazy action with excellent animation.And film is full of humor.I can say that this is actually a parody on serious action films.But action is quite unrealistic.Acctualy,whole concept is unrealistic and weird.You can see it on plot.And moverments of camera are too fast(for me...).The music is very good.Chinese tones,deepnes etc.Voice acting is very good,too.Very good experience.The message of film is nice and highlighted.So,film is enjoyable,funny,good for watching together with family.It is nothing special,but fans of first part would not be disappointed. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Paws, Purpose, and Pandamonium","The follow-up to Kung Fu Panda, it combines heart, humor, and martial arts prowess. The movie centers on the foolish panda named Po as he struggles with his identity and encounters a new enemy that threatens China. The movie deftly strikes a mix between heartfelt moments and action-packed scenes while examining themes of inner power and self-discovery. With its gorgeous settings and expertly choreographed martial arts sequences, the visually stunning and flawlessly drawn film captivates moviegoers. The film is engaging for both kids and adults because of its cutting humor, superb voice cast, and deep character development. Kung Fu Panda 2 is a poignant and exciting cinematic journey, made the more so by its bright animation and stirring themes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Extremely Enjoyable,"I am going to cut right to the chase. Kung Fu Panda has a better villain than over half of the movies that Hollywood coughs up these days. Lord Shen is evil, compelling and downright entertaining to watch. With Jack Black adding his Jack Black energy to the movie, despite only his voice being present, this movie becomes even more of an entertaining watch for the entire family. Though this movie has dark elements and moments, it adds to the story that is accompanied by the beautiful visuals we have come to know and expect from Dreamworks. Kung Fu Panda 2 is an entertaining piece of film perfect for family movie night. In short, better than all modern Disney.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Best Possible Sequel to an Animated Film,"I have read all the negative reviews about this film, and I am happy to say they are all dead wrong.Kung Fu Panda 2 does everything right in terms of a sequel. For a movie for kids, this movie has a surprising amount of depth and emotion. The movie does an excellent job at balancing humour, action, and emotion so well in the 92 minute runtime, not to mention it is paced amazingly.I do not remember the last time an animated movie made me cry this much, and I hardly ever cry at animated movies. The dive into Po's past is handled with such maturity, and the movie does not hesitate to explore darker and much more upsetting themes.I must also talk about my favourite part of the entire movie: the villain, Lord Shen. Whenever I see a movie, I look for a good antagonist for our given protagonist, and Lord Shen is perfect. This is a villain that seriously challenges our protagonist. Where in the first one, Po was challenged physically, in this film he is challenged emotionally. As far as Gary Oldman's performance, it is spot on! He is absolutely menacing and scary, and I love that he's a peacock.To cap it all off, this is a movie that just gets it. We are taken on the hero's journey and given insight into his backstory profoundly. The movie even references the symbolism for the animals and what they represent, such as a panda representing peace and self awareness, and a peacock representing power. All in all, this movie is perfect. If you have not seen it yet, I definitely recommend watching it, especially to prepare for Kung Fu Panda 4!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome? Well... almost.,"Having watched ""Kung Fu Panda (KFP-1)"" so many times and having fallen in love with those characters and humor again and again, the expectations were just so high for ""Kung Fu Panda 2 (KFP-2)"" when I watched it, and which it slightly fell short of. The IMDb ratings don't tell the real story. Ratings are high because the movie was visually spectacular. Agreed. Awesomenss in 3D! But as a movie, is it watchable as many times as the first part? And that, time can only tell.KFP-1 was constantly hilarious and it was just nonstop fun. The villain ""Tai-Lung"" was ferociously special. KFP2 is a different breed. It touches various other aspects of life like - pain, sacrifice, vengeance, inner-peace... The villain ""Lord Shen"" is cunningly evil. So this movie, in a way, is more mature than the former, but not as flamboyantly hilarious.One of the strong points of KFP-2, is the way it deals with the emotions. The sensitivity of relationships between Po (Panda) and his father (Duck), his friends - the furious five, especially Tigress, is dealt superbly well. Parts of the movie involving 'Po' as a baby, are very cute and touching. The sequence where 'Po' finds his inner-peace almost got me crying, and when he uses the same technique in the climax fight, that gave me goose-bumps. That was AWESOME!DreamWorks has done a great job. Awesome graphics, action sequences, characterization, good humor, but not so awesome plot. Plot is not bad but small, which makes you feel the movie is short. It has lot of fights alright, which are mostly amusing so the movie never gets boring. But one of the weak points of the movie, I felt, are some of the dialogs of Po (Jack Black), which sounded half-baked to me, and could have been a lot more refined and funnier than they actually were. They probably were way too slapstick for my liking. But funny nevertheless. And forget not the voices of Shen (Gary Oldman) and Tigress (Angelina Jolie) in this movie. Fantastic!All in all, it's an almost AWESOME movie which had the potential to be utterly AWESOME.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Decent follow-up,"This film is not as good as the first Kung Fu Panda - who would expect it to be? - but it is still good in its own right.

Kung Fu Panda the second,"It's a good sequel. The original is really great, and this just doesn't match up. The story and villain are very good.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Animated Film of 2011,"Kung Fu Panda 2 reunites the audience with Po Ping (Jack Black), the tubby and somewhat lazy panda bear who has been named the fabled Dragon Warrior. He still has much to learn, however, and Po's teacher Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) spends most of his time trying to make Po understand the concept of inner peace. Things take a bad turn when Shen (Gary Oldman), an evil and power hungry peacock who was banished from the country long ago, returns to his former kingdom in the possession of a diabolical weapon. Po and his team are tasked with ending Shen's reign of terror before he can take over the whole of China but as their battle unfolds, Po is faced with the realization that this is a much more personal fight than he ever could have imagined.I didn't see the first Kung Fu Panda until a couple of years after it was released. Looking back, I'm not sure why I chose to stay away because I really enjoyed it. It isn't up to the level of Pixar, of course, but then again, that is an unfair standard to hold any film up against, let alone a kid's movie. KFP is pure, unadulterated fun and contains just enough brains to make the storyline run smoothly. This sequel picks up right where the original left off and the two films work together in almost perfect harmony. KFP2 jumps directly into the action and it doesn't let off the gas very often, exactly what you need to keep the attention of the kiddos while simultaneously preventing adults from finding issues to nitpick at. It's one of those films that would become tiresome if it was even ten minutes longer but at 91 minutes, there's nothing to complain about. This is a very lively film and (I would imagine purposefully) a bit reminiscent of the better elements of a Bruce Lee flick, only if Bruce Lee was funny and a bit overweight.KFP2 has an outstanding collection of talented voice actors, ranging from Angelina Jolie to Seth Rogen to Jackie Chan and director Jennifer Yuh uses them well. I've said this before but one of my pet peeves in an animated film is when a character (or characters) is relegated to second fiddle behind the actor providing the voice. I don't want a constant reminder that ""actor X"" is the face behind the drawing. I never had that issue here. In the back of my mind, I knew that the praying mantis is actually Seth Rogen but it wasn't constantly shoved in my face. And then there's Gary Oldman, of course, who brings a brilliant, villainous tone to the role of Shen. I've often said that if you want to make your film better, just add Gary Oldman and you're done. Shen is a more intimidating baddie than you could reasonably expect from this movie and an improvement over the villain in the first Kung Fu Panda.The area in which KFP2 sets itself apart from the average kiddie movie is in the sheer beauty of its animation. This is a gorgeous film that mixes sweeping landscapes with exquisitely detailed characters and powerful action sequences. For my money, the Kung Fu Panda franchise is the most visually compelling of the Dreamworks properties and I almost (almost) think it might have been worth seeing in 3D. All told, this is a highly enjoyable and funny movie that should please viewers of all ages. And in a year that is devoid of a strong Pixar entry, I would make the case that this is the best animated film of the year.Please check out my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com and ieatfilms.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Awesomeness Is Awesome As Ever,"By revisiting this movie, I feel that this is the kind of awesomeness that's as awesome as ever. King Fu Panda 2 is even more epic than the first film. It does have the same ability to be something awesome with an epic story, amazing animation, and a cast of great characters old and new. But the new additions the movie would add for another movie is unbelievably engaging. I won't get into spoilers, but the new character building for them (specially Po) really does help what is worth continuing the story of the dragon warrior. And this would have one of the best villains DreamWorks has introduced in their movies. I think that fans of the first film will really enjoy this movie. You guys should really check it out. The one thing I can say is it already got me excited how it's gonna continue with their next movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fine Instalment to a Wise Franchise,This is an alright instalment for viewers to watch. The storyline could have been better. There was room for improvement for the crew to create this film better. The cast was truly outstanding. They did a spontaneous job committing and connecting to the storyline and to their respective characters. This instalment reveals to viewers the possibilities of what the past can do to anyone. The past can have a real impact and perhaps it can hurt.

Great action for kids and adults,"The first Kung Fu panda movie was great for kids and even adults with lots of comedy.

It had a great story that was easy to understand and a little darker than the first. It was action the whole way through.For those of you who didn't like the first movie, maybe you will want to check this one out.

Affectionate and frequently funny follow-up,"And so the battle between Pixar and Dreamworks rages on. Dreamworks have been somewhat in the shadow of it's rival in the recent years, only managing average output such as Shark Tale, Over The Hedge and Madagascar, while Pixar have been formidable with the likes of The Incredibles, the Toy Story trilogy, and WALL-E, all of which could easily be called masterpieces. But Dreamworks had something up it's own sleeve back in 2008 with the extremely funny and enjoyable Kung Fu Panda, which was a huge success for the studio. And three years on, the more-than-welcome sequel arrives, and it's really rather good.After establishing himself as the Dragon Warrior in the first film, Po (Jack Black) heads the Furious Five, consisting of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross). All is well, as the powerful group easily dispose of any potential threat to the realm, under the watchful eye of Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). Po is seeking out answers to his birth, when he realises that his father Mr. Ping (James Hong) couldn't possibly be his biological parent, what with being a goose and all. But there is a new threat in town, and he is in the form of peacock Shen (Gary Oldman), who is stealing all the scrap metal he can to aid his new powerful weapon, which could see the end of Po and kung-fu.The thing that appealed most about the first film was it's genuine affection for kung-fu and China. It used Chinese-style animation in one sequence, and some traditional drawing in the end credits. Plus the action scenes were better than the majority of real-life action films, combining thrilling action with slapstick comedy to good effect. Here, they've changed into second gear, and the action is twice as ambitious, and twice as impressive. The epic climax sees many kung-fu warriors, including our heroes battle Shen's army, and I've not been as excited while watching an action scene since the hotel corridor scene in Inception. And in showing Po's childhood, they've created another beautifully drawn sequence that uses China's traditional paintings as its influence.Thankfully, the sequel is not a mere re-tread of the original. The fat jokes are kept to a minimum, the scope is expanded, and they've developed Po's story in revealing his childhood. One of the main things that concerned me was that it may miss Ian McShane, who for me stole the first film as the menacing Tai Lung. But in Gary Oldman, they've created a different sort of villain. Just as menacing as Tai Lung, he is not half the warrior, but he possesses something that Po and the Furious Five may be helpless against - a big gun.Not quite as good as the original - it lacks the freshness and under- uses Dustin Hoffman's kung-fu master - but a more than worthy follow-up. It even manages to make Jack Black likable, who after years of playing the same character in s**t films (not including The School of Rock), wears me down. And the sheer number of talented actors that have been brought in (apart from the already mentioned, there's also Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dennis Haysbert, Danny McBride and Michelle Yeoh) shows that the film is puffing it's chest out at Pixar. I'll be looking forward to the inevitable third instalment, and hoping it can carry on impressing.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Less Awesome, More Mehsome","Admittedly, I wasn't the biggest fan of the first ""Kung Fu Panda."" Don't get me wrong, it's alright, but that's all. Just alright. The jokes about him being big and clumsy get old after an hour and a half, to the point where it almost seems like a movie that's trying to (ironically) fat shame kids.""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is really more of the same. Same characters, same plot, same jokes. It's extremely predictable with literally no surprises, giving the characters little depth. What we are presented with here is essentially a paint-by-numbers family film. If you're okay with that, then more power to you. It's pretty harmless brain candy, but if you're looking for more substance or any way to challenge your kids a little, look elsewhere. Again, it's just kind of...there.

A Decent Sequel,"12 June 2011. The sequel out of necessity was unable to capture the freshness and the character development of the first movie and had to rely more on the action thrills and more of the me vs. them plot of good and evil. There were so slow parts but by the end the emotive climax was solid. The movie was helped along with some substantive and well balanced tidbits of one-liners of humor and the involving action sequences (some reminiscent of Croaching Tiger, Flying Dragon (2000) animated style maintained the momentum and interest in the movie. The actors' voices were less pronounced and distracting as it appeared that the sources of the real actors didn't seem to be so identifiable, except Jack Black, and enabled the audience to focus more on the animated characters than the actual actors as actors themselves.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Thankfully not the cash grab it could have been.,"Let me start out by saying that most of the charm in the original KFP was found in getting to know Po (Jack Black), Master Shifu and the Furious 5. The plot was fairly unspectacular and served only to pad the gaps between the action sequences. Well Dreamworks can't use the 'getting to know them' shtick anymore.We know that Po was a starry eyed son of a goose with no Kung Fu skills. We know that he coincidentally was nominated by an elderly short sighted turtle to be trained by a surly possum named Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) alongside a praying mantis, snake, crane, tiger and monkey to become the Dragon Warrior, saving China from danger.Re-read that Anyway this time we know all that, so all they have to 'wow' us is the action sequences and the plot. The action sequences are effective and occasionally as awe-inspiring as the posters demand we must find them. The plot is actually pretty thin and derivative, and is actually where Kung Fu Panda comes perilously close to Kung Phooey.This time around Po is instructed by Master Shifu to find inner peace in order to save China from Shen (Gary Oldman), a naughty peacock banished from China as a chick I guess – who dreams of taking over the country with his army of wolves and other nasty looking creatures through the introduction of weapons, with which he plans to kill kung-fu! Shen is particularly concerned that the Soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh) has foretold Shen's death at the hand of a black and white entity – gee wonder who that might be? Meanwhile Po and the Furious 5 are now local legends and spend their days as peacekeepers in the area, defeating ne-er-do-wells with kung-fu skills and exceptional teamwork. In a convenient revelation just before Po heads off to save the day he finds that his Father the goose is actually perhaps not his real Father after all who woulda thunk it? So off Po and the 5 go to kill two birds with one stone, only in this case there is in actuality but one bird, and they eschew weapons in favour of kung-fu, leaving the bird to use the 'stones' in his newly invented cannons.In Kung Fu 2 Master Shifu takes a noticeable step into the background, appearing only a few times through the film, Tigress (Angelina Jolie) steps up to almost co-star duties, with her serious and determined ying counterpointing Po's casual and carefree yang. The rest of the Furious 5 retain their famous voices but are consigned to being mere comic relief and being momentarily spotlighted in the frequent battles that dominate the second half of the film.Of course in between battles Po learns of his true origins alternately through interactions with Shen and the Soothsayer, and continues to search for his own inner peace deemed necessary to defeat his many feathered foe. This leads to an all star animal showdown with fur and feathers flying all over the shop in intricately choreographed and animated ways, and I don't think I am letting the cat out of the bag by saying that at the end of the day 'skadoosh goes the weasel'.As with the original Kung Fu Panda the action sequences and growling menacing animals might prove a little much for the tots under say 7, but even though this was reasonably similar to the original film the action carries the bulk of Kung Fu 2, and the moving sequence that ends the film will leave you heading home with a warmer feeling than perhaps the slightly hackneyed story deserves.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. Not the best animated movie you'll see this year (Rango will take some beating), but also not the most blatant shoulda been direct to DVD cash grab that I've seen.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

However, it is rare to find a sequel that boasts to be just as good if not better than the original, and this is one of those rare films. This one takes you behind the story of how Po came to be who he is, and I loved that concept. They took all the great elements of the first and emphasized them in this one, which is a smart move...the only thing missing was the ""skidoosh!"" and that is a shame. They gave every character a little more. Even Tigress, who barely had any lines in the first, had a bigger role in this one. The action was greater, the villain was greater, and the story was greater. To top it off, the very final scene before the credits caused me to burst into tears of excitement!

Where the Sequel outshines the Original.,"Its always a happy and very rare day when you go to the cinema to watch a sequel and come home believing it to be better than the original. Today was one of those rare days for me.For starters the movie has the return of all your usual characters. The movie has the same old light hearted humour in it and possibly even funnier than the previous one and don't worry just because Po is now considered good at Kung Fu it still doesn't mean he gets much right as you will see in the film.The only slight disappointment to this movie is the fact that the plot is quite similar to the original. I wont give too much away but the plot is strong yet similar to the original.Due to the disappointment of Cars 2 this year I definitely believe this is the film to watch this summer especially if you have kids.

An adept sequel to one of my favorite Dreamwork's series,"Seems like we have another case of SEQUEL-itis this summer, and most of them are garbage.Kung Fu Panda 2 dares to shake that trend, and succeeds and improves upon its predecessor in every way. Some may deem it childish, but this is an animated film with polish and directed with such expertise that is rarely found in animated films (nothing comes to mind except the recent RANGO and Toy Story 3).The AWESOME(ness): Fantastic casting and voices. This movie would be nothing without the voice of Jack Black. Other characters are great though. Amazing action for a kid's movie. The first film had action for more a comedic affect, but this time around huge set pieces drive forward huge brawls and battles. The fights are also extremely well choreographed and I never was confused about what was going on. Visually stellar. Animation has come a long way and this is the movie to further justify the credibility of the team at Dreamworks. The animation is smooth, and the visual effects are stark and vibrant, and colors pop off of the screen. Also, the 3D is fantastic, serving more as an extra layer of depth rather than cheesy Spy Kids pop-out effects. The soundtrack and sound mixing is also fantastic. Great story and overall sequel. With an original film that was so well received how do you make a great sequel? By answering those lingering questions and throwing a ton of action right at the viewer. Don't worry, it still has that Jack Black brand humor. And it's excellent.The Bad: The pacing of the entire film is very fast, and at a runtime of only 80 minutes, it's over surprisingly quick. I would've liked to see more character development here and there, and a break from the action sequences, but then this movie would lose its charm. It's so blitz paced, making Kung Fu Panda 2 incredibly entertaining, but also making me hungry for more substance.Kung Fu Panda 2 is just a great sequel. It's fast, surprisingly action packed, filled with hilarious situational humor, and tells a wonderful, if a little too fast paced, story and is visually stellar.It is easily the one of the better sequels Dreamworks has ever dished out, and is a must see if you are a fan of the original.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"As Good as the Previous One, And with good 3D","My expectations were a little low for this film. Mostly because sequels are seldom able to capture the magic created by the original work. But Kung Fu Panda 2 was able to recreate the same magic again. I think the 3 year gap also helped.Kung Fu Panda 2 retains the same sense of humor and appears really fresh. Po shows some vulnerabilities and has to go through an emotional journey, albeit a short one. More stress is on humor here than anything else, just like in the previous installment.There are some animation sequences which are pictured in past which were really fantastic and quite a nice change from the usual style of the movie. The 3D is really good unlike some other recent movies. There are enough good 3D scenes here to make it worthwhile to wear the clunky glasses.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A fantastic, substantial sequel","The sequel to the hit ""Kung Fu Panda"" (2008) (excuse the pun) really developed into a new level. From the first film we see Po's character develop from a big blob of a panda into a kung fu warrior. We also are introduced to the Furious Five. So the foundation of the characters is laid to allow the sequel to go all out in creating a substantial story. Yet, there is still development in Po's character for we discover his past and find out how indeed his father is a duck (or goose) anyway...I loved that the story was deep and it was still character driven. The relationship of the father and Po is really special and amusing due to the obvious appearance differences. This film is so much fun, for both adults and children, you will not be disappointed. I also loved the fact that the film managed to convey a deep message and yet it did not feel corny or cheesy. The message is about letting go of your troubled past and moving on into your future. There is also a shocking and awesome ending, the ending sequences are awesome. DreamWorks has done it again!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of 2011's best movies (definite blockbuster hit),"Kung-Fu panda 2 just amazes the viewers through out all cinemas. Just when you think that every sequel you watch will amount to little compared to the very first, Kung-Fu panda comes out with an entertaining and hilarious movie which had me rolling in the aisles.Whilst the first one focused more on the story behind Po's path to becoming the dragon warrior, the sequel brings you non-stop action and laughs. The cast are back and in tip-top shape, each complimenting each others acting skills. We now see more from the characters that play the furious five but less from Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). However, the story line that suddenly appears with a new foe just surprised me.Kung-Fu panda is definitely one movie that must be added to your bucket list.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Incredible!!,"If i had the option of writing a one word review for kung fu panda-2, i would leave it at that - incredible! Kung Fu Panda-2 is spectacular, excellent, awesome and better than the first one. Better in animation, better in action, better in effects (i watched it in 3-d by the way), better in the story and so so much better in humor. My god, this movies's humor had me in fits.Po, you are the god of kung fu. In some ways Po reminds you of Jackie Chan's style of fighting; there's action and there's humor at the same time. This movie also has a lot of new characters. What a creative imagination of bringing a peacock as the deadly villain - shen. and of course Po's pals, the tigress and mantis, are awesome as well.Watch The return of awesomeness. Watch Po save the world from the end of kung fu!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Po, THE PANDA hahahahahehehehehohohoho... ROFL .. ROFL... HILARIOUS!!!","The awesomeeeeeessssssst movie :).. Kung Fu Panda-1 was hilarious, outstanding, mindblowing and this one is no different.There are many reasons i liked the movie 1. Its different than the first one. the whole concept is different and they haven't tried to use the same jokes as the previous movie. Of course it is good vs bad, but then which movie isn't!! 2. The sense and timing of comedy is great. At least it appeals to me. 3. Po, The panda character is my all time favorite. His expressions throughout the movie itself makes me laugh. 4. It amazes me how creative these guys are. You will realize this throughout the movie.I cannot say that there are any drawbacks in the movie, because its job is to make you laugh, and , i was hysterically laughing throughout the movie. Even the fights have a great humor in them.This is one of the very few movies which made me laugh forget about everything and shamelessly laugh in the theatre. Am definitely going once again to watch the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as good as the first,"The first film captured the hearts because po was a regular guy who had greatness thrust upon him. In this one you can't quite tell if he's the dragon warrior or an idiot, which I get it the point. But it's weird when he can fight incredibly one minute, then is luckily stumbling to a win the next. The story is weaker but the voice acting is absolutely superb.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Totally the 'Return of AWESOMENESS',"Kung Fu Panda 2 was a delightful watch! Totally loved it. There are some movies that makes you glad and satisfied till the end...and Kung Fu Panda 2 is one among them...each scene is crafted with the best dialogues, visuals and a chockful of humor that'll make you laugh/content till the end. There's not a single scene that will bore you. Jack Black as Po, this time is accompanied by the first movies' cast, Angleina Jolie as Tigress, Seth Rogen as Mantis, Jackie Chan as Monkey, David Cross as Crane, Lucy Liu as Viper, Dustin Hoffman as Shifu...with a few new additions including Gary Oldman as the wonderfully voice-overed (Po's) menace, Shen; Michelle Yeoh, Jean Claude Van Damm, Dennis Hayesbert etc. Jack Black & Gary Oldman steals every scene they are in; together or apart.The legendary Hans Zimmer & John Powell's combined score was pure 'earcandy'. The 3D was delicious...this movie, like Avatar & Tron LEGACY is meant to be watched in 3D. Absolutely amazing CG visuals coupled with equally awe-inspiring 2D animation makes it a treat to watch. Past movies like Thor, Pirates Of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides were only excuses to cash in on the 3D...though Kung Fu Panda 2 was made with all passion & sincerity to provide the best and right use of 3D.My only minor complaint here is that some of the cast were underutilized, esp Po's mates' dialogues IMO were so less compared to the first movie. KUDOS to Jennifer Yuh for a wonderfully entertaining sequel and yes...those are a rarity these days. There's obviously a Kung Fu Panda 3 coming, as evident from the last scene, and my fingers are crossed for it..until then Ska2oosh! :D",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
I mean..... wow!,"If you saw my other review for Kung Fu Panda, you would know that not only was Kung Fu Panda a surprising film, it was an overall great film for all ages. I still love the original KFP. So much so that I was pumped for KFP2. Then the trailers came out and I was getting a bad feeling with them. The first teaser with the staring contest is great but the actual trailer rubbed me the wrong way. I'm not entirely sure what it was, but I think the trailer made the movie seem way more focused on comedy than anything else. That would be a problem because KFP1 did a great job at being more than a comedy. Regardless, I want to see it anyway, and oh my god! This movie is not only as good as the first but its even better. Everything is stepped up to the next level. The story, the characters, & the villain are all stepped up from the first. The movie goes for 2 acts and its great, but at the end of the second act something happens, and the entire way I saw this series changed. The third act in this movie is something you have to see to be believed. If you don't know, this movie gets extremely emotional and legitimately sad to the point of tears for me. I know it sounds so strange that a movie about a kung Fu fighting panda made me cry. But that's the biggest strength to these movies. They are so much more than just that. I'm not the only one who cried either. The group I was in when I saw it were crying as well as most of the audience. They're are not very many sequels as good as Kung Fu Panda 2! If there is a gripe I would say it isn't as funny as the first. Considering the rest of the movie, that's an extremely small complaint. Its a film that moved me to tears and a film that may be the most surprisingly moving film I've ever seem. Again considering the movie is called Kung Fu Panda 2 staring jack black.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Way better than I remember,"I remember not really loving this the first time. The white peacock being the villain, a lot of red throughout the movie etc made me not so happy because I wanted a bit more of the first one. Now on a rewatch, I still have some problems with the colors and the animation. It is more detailed and advanced than the first I guess but it doesn't have the same charm as the first. But that's more of a personal preference maybe because of a bit of nostalgia too even when it originally came out. Three years was a huge time being a teenager, I guess. Now in a rewatch, I see that the story tries to have some depth and can maybe considered even better than the first. It has the action, comedy and great dialogue as should be expected from a sequel to the first part. Overall, it's as good if not better than the first.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Satisfying sequel,"Nice sequel. Worse villain and not as fun but the story is better and more emotional. Also, badass ending. Skadoosh.

"A kids movie that comes off as too adult. I didn't like it, and my kids were bored with it. First one was better. I say B-","""Your story may not have such a happy beginning, but that doesn't make you who you are. it is the rest of your story, who you choose to be... So, who are you, Panda?"" Po and his friends are back and this time they must stop an evil peacock from destroying kung-fu. Po must learn to deal with his past in order to once again save China and the art form. To me this movie and ""Cars 2"" both had the same problem. Both were made as kids movies but with adult story lines. The problem with that is the adult aspect of it is too watered down for adults to take and the rest is not childish enough for the kids to really enjoy. I was never a fan of the first one but my kids were. Watching this one we all thought it was kinda boring. If they would have gone for more of Po hurting himself like the first one they would have liked it better. Sequels to kids movies try to actually be different from the first one, and that's why so many fail. Two and eight year olds don't care about stories they want up beat and funny, not a panda figuring out his past. Overall, a kids movie that tried to be to adult and didn't work. I give it a B-...my kids give it a B.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Love it man!,"Although it certainly did seem that passing the reins over to rookie director Jennifer Yuh was bewildering, but Yuh turned out to be perfect in guiding the sequel and the beloved characters in yet another adventure, with bigger set action pieces, touching dramatic moments, and retaining plenty of humour from the get go. Credit of course must go to writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger in coming up with a natural progression of the story of Po (Jack Black), and filling it with a lot more elements from classic martial arts film formulas such as a jail break involving skilled pugilists in captivity, a pagoda, getting beat down, recovery and recuperation, and the learning of a new, ultimate skill. To think that the worries came from the scribes being responsible for the snooze-fest Monsters Vs Aliens, and Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.Kung Fu Panda 2 brings back the A-list voices of Black as Po the Panda, now very much comfortable in his celebrity role of the prophesied Dragon Warrior, and the Furious Five consisting of Angelina Jolie as the no-nonsense, hard hitting Tigress, Seth Rogen as the wisecracking Mantis, David Cross as Crane, Lucy Liu as Viper and the underused Jackie Chan as Monkey, recognizable animals used in distinctive martial arts boxing styles. Also returning are Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu and James Hong as Mr Ping, while joining the fray are Gary Oldman as the chief villain Lord Shen the vain peacock, Michelle Yeoh as The Soothsayer, Jean-Claude Van Damme as Master Croc, Dennis Haysbert as Master Oxen and Victor garber as Master Thundering Rhino, the latter three forming some formidable masters of kung fu whose city they're protecting falls under siege.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A movie even the 'hard core' can love,"A consistent sequel. The story's plot follows Po as he works to save Kung Fu from a new evil. This movie does a great job of tying up the past and gives us more depth into Po's story. The movie hints at a love interest that acts as Po's biggest support throughout the movie. I would have liked to see more character development for Po; like in the last movie, he is still immature but takes strides at growth. The movie's theme is growth and moving on from the past. This is a valuable lesson that adults in the audience can take away. The characters and voice acting are as equally fleshed out and impressive as the original. The scenes and designs are also as detailed as the original. The background music is supportive of the scenes and consistent throughout the movie; I noticed it more this time than in the first film. Overall, another great DreamWorks movie; however, I would have liked to see more character growth from the first movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as good as the first KFP.,"First Impression:At first, Kung Fu Panda 2 is an impressive sequel that bravely continues the story from the first movie. Yet, as the movie progresses, the movie presents a mix of stunning visuals overshadowed by uninteresting, cliche villains, creating a conflicting tone for the narrative.The Positives:Hans Zimmer is always on point musically. His score beautifully captures the essence of the original, ensuring the sequel stays true to its musical roots. Moreover, the plot is interesting. Exploring Po's backstory further enhances the story and provides a strong argument for its continuation beyond the initial movie. The funny interactions between Po and his adoptive father add humor to the movie, keeping the franchise's unique mix of comedy and emotion.The Mixed:The film starts off strong with lively characters and an intriguing plot, but later becomes weighed down by clichés in the second half. While the beginning shows potential, the later sections are filled with long and expected battle sequences. Shifting towards cliché hinders the narrative from delving into new and engaging scenes.The Negative:The sequel features a darker palette visually, which, while artistically justified, doesn't always work in its favor, particularly during action sequences that feel more dreary than dynamic. The sound design in this installment is not as deep or immersive as the previous one. There is a noticeable rush in the cinematography and editing, which detracts from the strong visual storytelling seen in the first film.Conclusion:""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a sequel that has its bright spots but ends up feeling weighed down by its ambitious goals. Although it effectively broadens the narrative world and maintains the musical and comedic appeal of the original, it falters in its visual appearance. The movie fluctuates between moments of excellence and mediocrity, ultimately earning a 5/10 rating.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome! Loved this movie and will probably drag hubby to it. :),"I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. I can't write a verbose review but I have to do 10 lines to meet guidelines here. To put it simply, I think this movie may be better than the first, which I enjoyed. My 9 year old loved it. But to my surprise, my 18 year old who tagged along with us thought it was great too! A tiny bit slow to start or it would have gotten a 10. Within 20 minutes it was hopping. Made me laugh pretty often. Sappy me, had tears in my eyes at the end. The colors and animation were a delight. The comic delivery from Jack Black came at just the right times. I'm not sure how I'd feel about a 3rd which they left the door open for. I think this ended on just the right note.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Let It Flow,"In ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" after an exquisite Wushu display, Shifu (voiced by venerable and irreverent Dustin Hoffman) says to student Po (Jack Black), ""Anything is possible, when you have inner peace."" This belies a certain authenticity. The Founder of Aikido said, ""True victory is victory over oneself."" At the narrative arc, sage Soothsayer, voiced with eloquent gravitas by the amazing Michelle Yeoh, instructs the Kung fu Panda Po, ""Let it flow."" She tells him to let go of his painful stories of the past. In doing so, he has nothing, and everything is possible. She reminds Po that all he has is right now, and the rest of his life. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is whimsically funny in the unexpectedly transformational journey.The story by Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger, and Robert Koo enhances the original ""Kung Fu Panda"". First time Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson captures the essence of the martial arts path from ingenious angles without significance—a smart thing. She seamlessly fuses kung fu choreography and the spirit of the way in ""Kung Fu Panda 2"". I did not see the movie in 3D, though it is visually breathtaking. We see serene mist covered mountain forests, austere castles, and elegantly crafted pagodas.In the movie's preface, Soothsayer (Yeoh) narrates the story of the ruling Peacock Clan in ancient China. The heir to the Kingdom is the arrogant Shen (ominously dark and wounded Gary Oldman). Prophesy foretells of his defeat by the Black and White chosen one. In a Machiavellian attempt to alter his fate, Shen orders the genocide of the Panda. Abhorred by the bloody actions of their son, Shen's parents banish him from the Kingdom. Shen vows vengeance. But has Shen truly altered fate?As no surprise and the source of irony in ""Kung Fu Panda"" Mr. Ping (wise and funny James Hong) reveals to Po that he was adopted, somewhat. Given that Mr. Ping is a goose, not a real ""aha"" moment. So Po must discover who he is, physically and spiritually.Since Po became the Dragon Warrior, profoundly getting that there is no great secret, he leads the Furious Five against all evil doers. However, Po still seems a bit of a goof, not really the Kung fu Master. This may just be the clumsy charm of Jack Black's embodiment. Strong and slender Tigress (sublimely confident Angelina Jolie) is clearly the powerful martial artist. She in fact schools Po in her prowess on occasion. We begin to wonder if, Tigress was really the chosen one, not Po. Jolie is subtle in dialing down Tigress's arrogance and impatience with her leader. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" works in the compassionate partnership of Black and Jolie, and the evil force of Oldman as the merciless Shen. Other members of the Furious Five appear relegated to the background this time around.In this story, Shen has created a massively powerful weapon that may vanquish Kung fu. So Po must end Shen's path of vengeance and domination. More importantly, Po must discover who he is and find the peace within. Yeoh as Soothsayer is impeccable eloquence assuming the helm for Shifu (Hoffman) as Po's guide in his transformation into mastery. Black is surprising in balancing humility, gravity, and whimsy. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is hilarious, and state of the art CGI animation. What really inspire are the performances of Yeoh and Black, in the story of the hero reconciling the world and finding peace. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" gets it right in this noblest of pursuits.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better then the first one in every way and is a fantastic film,"Kung Fu panda 2 is one of the best film sequels of all time IMO. It took everything that made the first one great and made it better.The story line is more emotional, the villain was much better, the music was better, the furious five had more lines and development especially tigress.The animation is more crisped and it looks great! Every animal has a unique design and the fur detail especially is awesome!Every character in this film is better for example PO is more confident then before and is more wise while still being hilarious. Tigress is more likable and bad-ass here as well as having more personalty. The villain lord Shen voiced by Gary Oldmen did such a great job in making him believable. Lord Shen is way better then Tai lung since he more bad ass, more developed, had more screen time and did something horrible to PO which i won't spoil.Mr ping is more loving and kind here then he was in the first film (even tho I still found him likable in the first one) The films comedy is just as hilarious as it was before but I found the first film to be a bit more funny.The voice acting is better here to and displays more emotion then before. The pacing is very fast but that makes it more entertaining in my opinion and it never feels slow. The film is rather short too but then again a lot of kids movies are short so I can kind of understand why.The only down side to the film is Shifu being a minor character, but then again I think it helped the film in a way because it gave the furious five a chance to shine and somebody has to protect the valley of peace! not to mention he was in the climax which was epic!Overall Kung Fu Panda 2 is epic, emotional, beautiful, heartwarming, dark, hilarious and is worth checking out if you are a fan of the first film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

An entertaining family film!,"Kung Fu Panda was a critical and commercial success in 2008, making over $630 Million worldwide and was very popular in the lucrative Chinese and Asian markets. It was considered a return to form for Dreamworks and of course with all these factors a sequel was inevitable. And you know what, Kung Fu Panda 2 is just as good as the original.In Gongmen City in ancient China the peacocks rule a peaceful and prosperous land and bring joy with their invention fireworks. But the heir to the throne Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) wants to use fireworks as a weapon to conquer China. A soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh) warns that Shen will be defended by a ""black-and-white"" warrior and he leads his army commit genocide (you know for kids) against the panda village. Yet one baby panda survives.Po (Jack Black) continues as the Dragon Warrior and protects the Valley of Peace from bandits and pirates with the Furious Fives. But Shen returns to Gongmen City with a new weapon that can defend kung fu. As Po and co set out to stop the most powerful peacock imaginable Po stars to have memories of his past and wants to know what happened to him.Kung Fu Panda 2 continues what works in the original film, excellent action sequences that are quick, fluid and easy to follow because of the camera movements which follows fights, lots of well done slapstick and visual gags and a few funny lines and clever plays. The story is a little darker then the original film but that is why it has a PG rating.The animation is wonderful as you would expect from a Dreamworks production. The CGI is detailed from the hair, to the Chinese buildings and everything you can think of. It is a fast and fluid and some of the creations were very creative, particularly Shen with his eyebrows, his metal claws and use of small knives. Baby Po was a very cute. As well as the CGI Kung Fu Panda 2 has two other styles of animation, a very well made old fashioned paper animation for the prologue giving the start a story book look like the first two Shrek films and still very creative and the other was using traditional 2D animation for the flashbacks which is fitting for the setting and it is great to see director Jennifer Yuh Nelson incorporates these different styles into an entertaining action film.The voice cast is solid as expect, the highlights being Black and Oldman. Black because of his earnest performance and being a natural comedian and Oldman because of his deadly sinister and serious delivery, making him a compelling, power-hungry villain.Some have stated that the sequel follows the formula of the first film. Whilst the need to find inter-peace is similar to first film and the heroes have to stop a big lethal bad guy Kung Fu Panda 2 is more of an adventure as the heroes are forced on a journey and liberate a city. It is different enough to be its own adventure and felt like it actually continued the story. Lets hope Dreamworks does not stuff up the third film like they did with Shrek the Third.Kung Fu Panda 2 is a very fun family film that is in keeping with its Chinese influences because of its art style and music and with the likes of How to Train Your Dragon shows what Dreamworks can do without the need to rely on pop-cultural references. It is a fast paced action film with plenty of jokes.A solid 4 out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very pleasantly fulfilled,"Yes I was the only grown man sat in the 10:40am showing of this film on my own. And yes I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was more of the same fun from the first film but progressed a little bit more with character background, a simple cultural story, and plenty of action. And it wasn't just these points I enjoyed, it was the general 'feel' of the film as a beautifully crafted homage to a few Chinese animated stylings. Voices were once again perfect for each character, with special note towards Gary Oldman and Danny McBride. Music was as fantastical as the animation and really builds the film as an excellent artistically entertaining piece. A superb sequel that other sequels should take note of. I left the theatre feeling both satisfied and elated, wanting just that little more of the film. And yes that does mean I would like to see one more Kung Fu Panda sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another great installment,I would say out of the three I have watched this one might be my favourite. The first time I saw it I was in the theatre with friends after just riding in a 75km charity bike ride and I could barely keep my eyes open. The movie was so good and I didn't want to miss anything but I was fighting a powerful tired. More powerful than all the Kung Fu in China.Since then I have rewatched this one again and again. There is nothing about this one that I don't like. The good guys are the same from the first one with a few new characters sprinkled in. The bad guy is pretty good as he is more about brains than brawn but still has some fighting skills.Would recommend this one to anyone even if you haven't seen the previous one.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Kung Fu and Animation return in style.,"KUNG FU PANDA 2 marks the return of Po and the Furious Five as they embark on a new adventure to stop a weapon so powerful it threatens the very existence of kung fu itself. Now the Dragon Warrior, Po is tasked with the responsibility of destroying this weapon, before the evil Lord Shen uses it to conquer all of China.The first KFP was a pleasant and heart-warming surprise for most people, myself among them. To see the film actually respecting the culture they are portraying, and imbue it with multiple levels of philosophy while remaining hilarious and kid-friendly, is a dream come true in this age of trashy movies where money comes before quality and everything else. KFP 2 retains that sincerity, and delves even deeper into the little profound life messages that surpasses it's predecessor in every way.Po is now enjoying his new life as a hero and a kung fu master, but is suddenly faced with the mystery of his dark past, and must deal with his inner demons as the truth slowly unravels. This leads to the character being far more emotive than in the last outing that affects those around him as well, giving this sequel a tone that is far less bright than it's predecessor. It offers the film a more emotional side as Po's investigation of his heritage and his new hero role causes ripples in his relationship with his Dad, and the father-son relationship serves as a powerful core to Po's inner conflict. His opponent this time, the albino peacock Shen, also contains far more character depth than Tai Lung in the first movie, and his ambitions more sinister and larger in scale. Both creatures of black and white compliment each other perfectly as the paths they choose are destined to meet and determine their eventual fate.The references to Chinese culture and old kung fu movies are there yet again, with the dumpling fight in the original film succeeded by a terrific battle with Chinese musical instruments, playing to oriental music that evokes a vibe of several movies, Zhang Yimou's Hero among them. The action is fantastic with the Five having their distinctive styles, while Shen's thin limbs, sharp weapons and ferocious feather-blades come in stark contrast with Po's free flowing, soft-over-hard Tai Chi style.As mentioned, the philosophical content, which I had previously feared would be toned down, gets full blown instead with many layers slid in. Po embarks on a quest to find inner peace, to create harmony within himself and ""let things flow"", as it is revealed that only when one's heart is unclouded with doubt and grudges can one tap into his or her hidden potential and, most importantly, attain true happiness. That is the main powerful message of the film and it is so brilliant in it's simple logic that makes it accessible to all races and religions. There are tons of other references to the theory of yin and yang throughout the movie that made me gasp and impressed with how much work the makers of the film have put in yet again.Kung Fu Panda 2, as expected and anticipated, is touching, full of heart, awe-inspiring at times, hilarious in others, and constantly filled with meaning. It is a film that can entertain and capture a child's imagination, but also tug the heartstrings of adults and give them something joyous to think about when the credits roll. And it made my fist hungry for justice.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A work of art!,"The first film is great and a veil should be drawn over the very disappointing '3' (when will studios learn that if they want to effectively 'milk' a franchise, they shouldn't skimp on the story and script?!). Whilst there aren't as many laughs in this one c.f. The first - though it still has some great jokes, it's a thing of artistic beauty!

One of The Best Sequels!!!,"Rewatching this second installment is actually better than watching it for the first time, from that opening scene to the end, Kung Fu panda 2 delivers action sequences that are well directed and really well done, my opinion and review change from my first review, I didn't give it that much credit maybe because I really loved the first one a lot, and I consider one of the best animations from Dreamworks, but Kung Fu Panda 2 delivers and becomes one of the best sequels in the franchise, also is one of those movies that won't let you go, from start to finish the suspense and the action is nonstop, that's what makes this movie a success, I give "" Kung Fu Panda 2 "" a 8 out of 10 Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Escape I Need,"This is a movie that provides an escape for me. Whenever I need to get my mind off of something, Po is there. Not just any Kung Fu Panda movie. The 2nd gives me the most comfort when I need it. They're able to tell this awesome story in a short amount of time. I love it so much I wish it was longer. The fighting is truly epic. What I like about it too is that the way they move, or the way they fight almost tells a story. I loved how they were able to develop the character of Po, and they teach us more about his backstory. That's then used throughout the film, and they use it to its advantage. I loved the father/son story. Every single time I watch it, that ending just breaks me 😭. For such a short amount of time, it's able to make me appreciate a lot more things. It gets me in a better mood.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent follow-up,"I always seem to underestimate the Kung Fu Panda movies. I wasn't that excited to see the first one, because I expected it to be too dopey and silly, but it was an excellent film. But when the sequel came out, I didn't have much interest in seeing it because so often sequels aren't very good. Once again, I was wrong.Since the plot of the first movie was, klutz who learns to be spectacular, the writers had a choice between trying to recreate that, as some writers do (either by introducing a new klutz character or by somehow reducing the star), but this movie takes the more intelligent approach of continuing the character arc. Po is still a goofy panda, but he is also a fantastic fighter who along with his fellow animals is immediately shown in impressive, exciting action.The animation is terrific, with humorous fights and foreboding enemy strongholds. The bad guy is appropriately nasty and quick, and the movie tosses in quick, never soggy moments of emotion.I will be less hesitant to watch the next film in the series.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Still as good and as fresh as the first one,","Kung Fu Panda 2 is a great movie,and is still as fresh and as good as the first one was,the storyline was great and all the characters were still as good and as funny as ever,but you really gotta give it to Jack Black as Master Po the star of the movie and the life of the whole thing,it wouldn't be the same without him.Master Po and the Furious five embark on an amazing adventure to fight an old enemy of kung fu with a new weapon,but when Po's dad tells him that he is adopted he gets curious of how things were before his duck father found him,but this old enemy knows the truth.-DILLON HARRIS",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Proper Sequel,"One thing that DreamWorks does well (with the exception of Shrek the Third) is sequels. They prove time and time again that they are very legit company in many cases, does better then its animated counterparts. Kung Fu Panda 2 is no exception as it seems the franchise is well at hand. After the incredible year of 2010 for DreamWorks after the cultural success of How to Train Your Dragon, and ending a great franchise (Shrek) they follow that year up with this. The movie's strengths are found within the story, not that its unique, but the secret ingredient found within. The secret ingredient is heart. Its not totally comedic as one would expect, but in the middle they tweak the film's tone with heart and emotion. This is what a proper sequel should do, taking the story and making it more then what we'd expect. Is this film a rehash from the last? Well, not really it offers new elements, especially to Po's character. The other characters are still they're same likable selves. In this however they really showcase the relationship growing between Po and Tigress which is the most unique and pleasurable relationship. The next thing is the villain voiced by Gary Oldman. He is the most interesting and menacing out of the villains so far. And that's hard to make a peacock menacing, and they did it like pros. Now the negative I have is what I said before, with the story not being unique and refreshing, but that's a slight error as the film makes up with heart. So a very small negativity. As a whole this film is one of DreamWorks' best. Now to grade. Animation: A Voice Acting: A- Story: C+ Music: B+ Characters: A+ Overall: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Entertaining sequel,"Well, Po is already a hero now, nevertheless, he has his moments of weakness and his frailties which still need to be overcome before he can teach his new enemy the lesson of his life.

A synergistic blend of Zen & Zeal. DreamWorks SKG has done it again!,"What can be better than watching Kung Fu Panda 2? Watching it in 3D, of course! The 'awesomeness' of the movie pops right out (pardon the pun).With the involvement of so many voice talents, including the triple J's (Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan), Van Damme 'The Muscle From Brussel', Charlie's Angel Lucy Liu and legendary actor Dustin Hoffman, it is no wonder that the entire animated film scores wonderfully BIG on the family 'fun' scale. I could hear kids' laughter resonating throughout the theater the entire time (adults too).I think DreamWorks Animation is fast establishing itself as THE leader in developing novel materials that explore new grounds, which will ultimately attract new audiences around the globe (from the Hollywood perspective).Hopefully, for the next installation, acclaimed director Lee Ang can be roped in to inject more 'pow wow' spin to the entire Kung Fu Panda franchise and boost it to even greater heights.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Still a lot of fun,"I can't think of anything I enjoy in the first movie that did not also show up here. All characters have distinct personalities which shine in every movement and speech pattern, the kung fu fights are still very entertaining to watch, both the soundtrack and the voice acting are still on point. Animators still favor having a lot of action happening at once in both foreground and background, so every shot feels alive and complete, and there's a small but meaningful amount of relationships being developed and furthered throughout the story.I don't particularly feel like complaining about anything here... This is a movie I can see myself re-watching whenever I want a laugh or just want to enjoy a kung fu flick with a lot of genuine passion behind it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly Excellent,"I was quite surprised to watch this film and discover that it was full of hidden jewels. There was some very interesting ""camera work"" as well as various nice montages though out the film. There was also a very nice mix of different styles of animation. The paper cut out puppet segments of the film were wonderful.That being said, my favorite part of the film was the relationship between the lead character and his father. For an animated film they truly tugged on the heart strings. I must also add that the subtle acting in the faces of the characters was incredibly well done by the animators.You should definitely check out this film if you're even the least bit curious.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome but not as much as the first part.,"When I watched the first movie it immediately became one of my favorite so I was both excited as well as afraid of watching the second part cause it could have spoiled the original one for me. Thanks to dreamworks it didn't and i laughed my heart out watching it.If I count the good things about the movie the list never ends it has excellent cast, amazing action, awesome humor,some real cute and emotional part, not to mention the best 3D effects i have ever seen(you will never realize that the movie is played on a 2-D screen) but the real gem was the rich comic style animation that is used to depicts the past.Having said all that I will still have to say that I liked the first movie more for the story line and character builds because I define how good a movie is not by how much I liked the first time but by whether this movie is forcing me to watch it again or not. may be it is my personal bias towards the character build because I like batman begins more than the dark knight but I always wanted a bit stronger story and some element of surprise which the movie denied right in the beginning. all in all its a movie not to be missed by any animation lover in fact this movie will force some non animation fans to start liking it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Kaboom of Doom,"With the success of Kung Fu Panda Dream Works finally managed to surpass Pixar with it's heavily detailed and achingly beautiful animation.3 years later it's sequel picked up from where it's predecessor left us in a small tiny village in the Republic of China no wait,China wasn't republic then it was still under the Imperial rule.Never mind history,Part 2 begins with the Villain Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) embarking upon a mission to take over China,as the story progresses Lord Shen's and our Hero Po (Jack Black) paths intertwine as prophesized by his soothsayer.Po discover's his past while in pursuit to stop Lord Shen from destroying Kung Fu and taking over all of China.I particularly found Lord Shen a bit tamer than Tai Lung from the first part.Lord Shen when compared to Tai Lung cannot do awesome Kung Fu or does he emit the same evil as Tai Lung does.Though Tai Lung had a lot less of dialog than Lord Shen i prefer Tai Lung over Lord Shen as Villain for his super powers and imposing character.The heart of the story remains the same with Po overcoming odds to see out any challenge to the peace and tranquility of his village.Underneath the silly gags and Laugh Out Loud moments there is an underlying message in the movie.""Your Past doesn't matter,it is what you choose to become"" Po chose to become the Dragon Warrior and he finally finds ""Inner peace"" and come to terms with his past in the movie.Audiences often ignore the message a movie tries to convey to it's viewers,all they want from a motion picture is to be entertained the whole 2 hours.Even the first Kung Fu Panda had a beautiful message,which urges one to go out and achieve their dreams despite the many obstacles that confront them.Kung Fu Panda 2 has a lot more ""Kung Fu"" in it.It's fast paced action and equally fast editing leaves you bedazzled with you wanting more of it.I personally feel the animation got better than the previous Dream Works production's,it had the same detail and shades of their hit animation picture 'How to train your Dragon'.However i felt the sequel was less comical than the prequel.Part one was a laugh riot with every passing scene,also part two had it's moments but not in the same volume as part one.Another comparison between the two being the movie's climax.Part one wins hands down with an epic sorts of fight sequence laced with humor over part two's slow ending with a hint of a possible 3rd movie in the making (i learnt today that Kung Fu Panda is a 6 part franchise,can you imagine the fun that awaits us?).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I always thought sequels are not better than the original. I guess I was wrong !,"Sequels never usually measure up to the standards of their predecessors. However, Kung Fu Panda 2 is an exception, not only is as good as the first film, it's even better. This is what I would call a perfect film, from the beginning to the end. A strong factor of the film is that they have continued the story instead of rehashing it. For example, Po is still likable but has developed in his Kung Fu, while the Five and Shifu have grown to respect and care about Po and not just making fun of him. There is an introduction of new likable characters such as the wise soothsayer or the humorous Master Croc(voiced by martial arts icon Jean Claude Van Damme). In the first film I felt the villain (Tai Lung) was cool but Garry Oldman's Lord Shen is quite the opposite. He has the right balance of malice and humor that in my opinion puts him on the same levels of animated villains such as Scar, Shere Khan or Gaston. The animation and action were both superb while Hans Zimmer and John Powell combined to make one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. Overall, Kung Fu Panda 2 is not only an animated masterpiece but is also one of my favorite films of all time.Kung Fu Panda 2 has the right balance of humor, drama, action, suspense and warmth that make it what I consider to be a perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
On Par with the original,"This is a sequel that I can't tell is either better or worse than the original.

The animation is great, and unlike other Dreamworks films, it includes quite a bit of 2D animation in it that really looks good. The voices once again are good, Jack Black gives it his all, and the rest of the cast is good, and they let Jackie Chan have more than one line!

Kung Fu Writing! Just for pun kicks!,"I Want Pandy!!! So I decided to get my kicks with a ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" viewing. I was aware that it was a sequel and there is always a ""more of the same"" element to sequels. However, I was pandily surprised that ""Kung Fun Panda 2"" played at more being a prequel than a sequel. Dragon Warrior Po (awesomely voiced again by Jack Black) is now on a mission to defend Kung Fu & China with his mates ""The Furious Five"" against an evil peacock called NBC, I mean Shen. However, within the fighting pandamonium there is also a subplot in the movie of Po trying to search his past and figure out who he really is and where he is from. The two plot lines interconnect in ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" not just to provide narrative depth to the movie, but to present how one's upbringing is so relevant to one's survival & also character. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" looks beautiful on screen, and besides the latest computer graphic animation design included in the movie there is also ""old school"" simple animation inserted to differentiate the time periods. Director Jennifer Yuh did a yeoman's job or should I say yuhwoman's job by incorporating noble Chinese culture into the narrative, as a love letter to China. However, Yuh did get carried away with too many explosion sequences that for the most part bombed. Nevertheless, it is the comedic protagonist Po that makes the Kung Fu Panda movies work. Po still demonstrates that his love for the culinary arts is still his favorite thang! This Panda still loves to munch it down. I just hope we don't see an offshoot of his dietary habits in a Part 3 called ""Kung Poo Panda"". Besides Black, Angelina Jolie also nailed it once again with her lipwork as Tigress, 20% of The Furious Five. Gary Oldman playing a villain never gets old, and he does some badass vocal work as Shen the Peacock. Dustin Hoffman just gets in a scene or two this time around voicing Master Shifu, but when Hoffman speaks you better listen ""He's talking here!!"". ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" does not hit on all cylinders, but it is no ancient Chinese secret that it is quite entertaining, mostly due to its Black comedy! **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Probably better than it's predecessor,"This is probably the tenth time I'm watching this film until I finally decided to describe my thoughts on it, this franchise was one of the main ones who shaped my childhood the most, when i was young I definitely remembered it mostly for the epic fight scenes, which there are plentiful of and are top notch and contain loads of fun. But watching it as an adult is an entirely different experience,the message about embracing your past and accepting it is heartwarming and fantastic, and is delivered exponentially that I got shivers through my whole body, I love that they expanded on the emotional field so much without taking a fraction of what this movie is for children, and the darker and gloomier theme definitely suits it.The movie also does everyrhing a sequel needs, it shows character development, didn't revolutionize to much and expanded on the plot and the universe of the film.In particular po's and tigress's relationship is genuinely beautiful throughout the franchise, the combination of a warm and joyful panda combined with Tigress's composure and warrior personality genuinely provide wonderful moments together when they begin embracing the other's emotional compartments. And their relationship is a blessing to the franchise. Also the music is top notch like you would expect from 2 top notch composers.This franchise(and in particular this movie) has a very special place within my heart and I will love it forever, I feel so lucky to be born at the same time as the golden age of cinema.10/10 will forever remain as one of the greatest sequels to any movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Kung Fu Panda 2 - 4 Stars,"I like Po's commitment and enthusiasm. He has gone from mopping floors and serving plates at a noodle bistro to being declared as China's ultimate protector, The Dragon Warrior. In this worthy sequel, the call is clear for The Dragon Warrior's skills as China is faced with a new threat. With a joyful spirit and an active appetite, it is of great news that Po is ready for another adventure. Foes should be fearful. Once they hear the first echo of a rumbling stomach, they should start running away.A new villain rises as Lord Shen, a depraved peacock, plots to end kung fu and take control of China. He has created a special mechanism that shoots fiery balls of fire and metal. So in short, he has made a very powerful cannon. Lord Shen comes off as a more dangerous villain than the one in the first installment because he is accompanied by a vast army of wolves. The structure of the animal kingdom here is interesting in a way that a peacock is able to command these wolves without ending up as breakfast. I guess this is okay, since it would be harder to imagine an evil wolf in charge of a legion of peacocks.Anyway, while Lord Shen is busy constructing ammo for his weapons, Po is advised by Master Shifu to learn inner peace. But Po is distracted by involuntary flashes from his past, making him wonder about his true origins. Only now does Po really think about how he, a panda, could be fathered by Mr. Ping, a goose. Such questions bother our hero, but those will have to wait; Lord Shen and his wolves need to be stopped.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/kung-fu-panda-2/",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda 2 is an excellent continuation of this animated univers,"My daughter and I recently enjoyed watching Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) on Peacock. The storyline unfolds as Po discovers he was adopted, prompting him to embark on a quest to find his parents and unravel the mystery behind their disappearance. Despite everyone believing he's the last Panda on Earth, Po uncovers a plot that could jeopardize the world and reveal the truth.Directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson (Kung Fu Panda 3), the film features the voices of Jack Black (School of Rock), Angelina Jolie (Mr. And Mrs. Smith), Jackie Chan (Rush Hour), Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie), Seth Rogen (Knocked-up), Gary Oldman (Bram Stoker's Dracula), and Lucy Liu (Kill Bill).The movie, rightfully known for its impressive animation and stellar voice actors, continues to showcase an awesome universe with lovable animals. The adoption storyline adds a fun and mysterious adventure, delivering valuable lessons on love. The entire premise captivated me from beginning to end, with the flashback animation style being particularly impressive. The radish sequence never fails to make me smile, and the action scenes, especially the final battle, are a highlight.In conclusion, Kung Fu Panda 2 is an excellent continuation of this animated universe. I'd score it an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than the first? Possibly so!,"Of course it's a rare thing for sequels to be better than the original, especially for animated movies. It's hard to say if this movie is truly a better one than its original predecessor but it at least is on some fronts.Looking back at it, the first ""Kung Fu Panda"" movie was really one that set up its characters. This movie wastes absolutely no time on that and gets right into the action. Quite literally and it never really ever stops or slows down and I mean this as a positive thing. This is a real action flick, that is filled with some spectacular looking fight scenes, that are well animated and choreographed.And compared to the first, this movie has also vastly improved visually. You could tell the the animation techniques had been improved over the years (the first movie was released in 2008) and this no longer looks like an in-between movie for Dreamworks, which was perhaps still a bit the case for the first movie.But it has not improved just visually but it seems that it's more matured as well. And with that I mean its story, characters and comedy. It has very little childish humor and characters in it and it seems that they focused more on the older audience as well this time. It's not simply just a kids movie but it's a great adventure- and action filled movie, which the whole family can enjoy together.This are most of the things that make this an even better and more enjoyable movie to watch than the first one was already. But there are also some things that are less great about it.The story unfortunately really isn't that special. I personally feel it could had done with one or two more little side-plots. It could had made things more interesting, since it now mostly is being a very straightforward movie, that follows mainly one main plot line, which was a bit of a simplistic one to begin with.Also the main villain was a bit lacking. He just never came across as all that threatening, despite the fact that he got voiced by Gary Oldman. Or perhaps it's simply just because a peacock of course doesn't look all that powerful or threatening. No, I definitely still preferred the villain out of the first movie (the snow leopard Tai Lung), who was simply awesome in it.Oh and I still don't understand why such minor characters had to be voiced by such big stars. It really doesn't matter or impresses much that Dustin Hoffman's, Angelina Jolie's, Jackie Chan's, Seth Rogen's and Lucy Liu's voices are in this movie, since they hardly have any lines at all and their characters might as well just had been voiced by a couple of unknowns and not much would had been all that different about it. But oh well, at least the movie is consistent with this, since this also was probably still the biggest complaint about the first movie, in which mostly the same characters and actors appear.So in some ways it's better than the first and in others it's worse. But overall it is a more than welcome sequel that more than serves its purpose and is watchable and suitable for basically all ages.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Long Ago I Rated an 8,"This review hints at spoilers but doesn't deliver details. If you are on the fence just stop reading this review and watch part 1 & 2. I can't truly give this movie praise without at least hinting at spoilers that made the movies meaningful to me. It was so good that scrolling through my old ratings, I had to update this minor slight and write a review. For an animated sequel movie this movie is virtually peerless in quality story telling. It is actually better and more emotionally packed than the others. With an emotional punch climax really paying true homage to East Asian philosophies that champion balance, truth, and harmony with self. It been years since I have seen this movie and I often think of the beauty of the finale. Even though it was a family movie I was genuinely in fear for the protagonist near the end and understood the antagonist as real hurt soul. And I would not trust any reviewer that has liked other cgi animated movies and rated this one below a 6 or 7. It is better than the original and it can bring a tear to your eye in the climax. It was so good that story in part 3 should have be relegated to a few episodes of the TV series. It might not have been the best financial move but as an artistic property probably the best move.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Japanese visuals meet Hollywood!,"The visuals were so good that it reminded me of some of the most beautiful Japanese movies (The Girl Who Lept Through Time, Totoro, etc.) this movie is that GOOD!! And this movie merges those visuals with the traditional Hollywood feel good factor. :-)..................Hope you have already read the official story line. Don't worry if the story seems a little cheesy, you will love it when you see it. I think its not even the story that matters much. Everything is done so stylishly, its like a Matrix movie in Panda style. Each scene individually is a treat to watch.They have avoided most of the clichés, and places where you feel that you are going to see one, it surprises you with a simple and elegant twist, which almost always left me grinning or laughing.Is this movie recommended? YES, VERY. Whatever age you are, it will make you happy. :-)........... But do remember to see it in the highest resolution you possibly can, else you may miss out on a lot of this movie's beauty.Cheers!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Awesomeness, back with a Bang!!","Watched this movie in 3D with my friends and had a great experience. The 3D effects are fantastic along with the movie. The storyline is awesome and has furthered my experience of watching this movie.I have watched many animated movie this year such as Rio and Rango but this takes the cake. Fun and enjoyment for the whole family, Guaranteed!!!Fantastic animation along with a great storyline makes this movie one of the best animated movies I have watched along with Toy Story 3, Wall-E, Up to name a few which, I would watch over an over again.I would rate this movie 10/10 just for the enjoyment of watching a movie.I would recommend everybody to watch this movie at least twice.

One of the best kid's movies this year,"I thought the first Kung Fu Panda was really cute and it likened to the first Shrek - this one was even better. The storyline was darker and it was definitely more violent than the first (maybe a little too much for little ones) but I really enjoyed it and laughed out loud and cried more than once. There were just enough clever one-liners for it to be cute without overdoing it, and there was just enough meat to the plot to interest kids and adults without it being boring. I also think Po was less Jack Black as a talking panda and more of a character on his own. I went to see this at the el cheapo theater one day in the middle of the week and it was the perfect way to spend a hot summer afternoon.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Soundtrack,"This movie was greatly film and a good sequel. From 1 hour and half short length time, the animation, plot,art, scores and character development just better than I expect that gave me a teary eyes in the end and show us meaning of family and love. The soundtrack composed by John Powell and Hans Zimmer made it extraordinary and best thing I've heard. Show us behind the music of Chinese instrument that made it...godly. I'd prefer this than the 1st movie, it gave me a lot of feels and relate to me at some point and the villain is very unique I love it, and thing that made the character a-bit mature, especially Po in this film. They were few laughs. After I get out of the cinema, it had me good vibes around me, it inspired me, it was a really good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) - Get Ready to Feel the 'Awesome-Tacular' Thunder....Again!,"I was one of the many fans of the first 'Kung Fu Panda' movie. It was an entertaining piece of animation, and the action was quite enjoyable for an entire family. Now, DreamWorks Animation has brought us ""Kung Fu Panda 2"". The sequel now brings some action-packed fight scenes, and some exciting new characters. The film brings us back to the tale of the Dragon Warrior, Po, portrayed by Jack Black, who has spent the rest of his life as the Dragon Warrior, learning the sacred teachings of Master Shifu, and fighting crime with the Furious Five (Tigress, Viper, Monkey, Crane, Mantis). Now, a villainous peacock named Emperor Shen, voiced by Gary Oldman, has been planning revenge to the land of China, and has created a deadly weapon that could destroy China, and the existence of kung-fu. But while Po and the Furious Five must team up to defeat Shen, Po faces problems of his own, by trying to understand his origin, who he really is, where did he really come from, who were his real parents, and how did he live with a long-necked goose for a father. Then we have our movie, and it's awesome! From start to finish, this movie is entertaining as hell. The voice talent is just super, since the ensemble from the previous film has returned, such as Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, and Jackie Chan. Now, there's Gary Oldman, who's one of the most perfect actors to play villains in the history of cinema. He resembles the previous villain, Tai Lung, perfectly. You really love to hate this guy, and he delivers the role in such a powerful way. The animation is gorgeous, the humor is hilarious, and the heart of this movie made me cry of joy. Also, the fight scenes are both exciting and family-friendly, and we also receive some interesting character development on Po's character, and the movie perfectly reveals his origin. But, the ending of the movie will make audiences go ""wow"". But it mostly means that a ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" may be in session. Fun characters, great storyline, terrific animation, and incredible fight scenes. What a family-friendly piece of entertainment. Go check it out with your kids, they will love it, and so will you. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"", in my review, ""family-friendly action, funny and moving"".",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Impressive martial arts, consistent gags - a worthy successor.","The first Kung Fu Panda made audiences go blind from over-exposure to pure awesomeness (and attractiveness) so this sequel was always destined to fall short of the massive benchmark set, the question was just by how much. Well, thankfully, not by much at all. With Po (voiced by Jack Black) now the Dragon Warrior and having to save the art of kung fu from the wretched Lord Shen (Gary Oldman – excellently sinister), the uber-impressive martial arts sequences are back in full force. Throw in consistent gags, iridescent animation as good as any Pixar outing (aided by the subtle 3D) and superb voice work by all involved – including Dustin Hoffmann as the wise Shifu, Angelina Jolie as the fierce Tigress, Seth Rogen as the cheeky Mantis and, in a stroke of casting genius, Jean-Claude Van Damme as the chop socky expert Master Croc – and you have a highly worthy successor that will please boys and girls of all ages. Bring on KFP3! Skadoosh.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Animated Action: Second and Third Dimension Pleasantry,"Jack Black is at his best when embodying an unlikely kung fu fighting Panda named Po. With more action and even better visuals than the original, Kung Fu Panda 2 is successful at being a memorable and entertaining sequel. Behind the scenes, Direcor Jennifer Yuh creates the visuals of the film by pairing unique 2D story telling animation with traditional contemporary 3D distinguishing between various elements of the film's story. The story builds off of the first film very well continuing the growth of Po as the Dragon Warrior. Questions not explored in the original are delved into uncovering where Po came from. Because lets face it Mr. Ping (James Hong, ""Mulan"") isn't exactly a panda and is only Po's adopted father. Even so, Mr. Ping acts as a very good loving father and is aided by Po's newfound glory with the growth of his noodle shop's popularity. Po does not see his adopted father as much because of Po's new responsibilities and search for his real parents. A new power crazy antagonist by the name of Lord Shen (Gary Oldman, ""The Dark Knight"") joins the series threatening the extinction of kung fu forever with the creation of a new weapon. With the help of the furious five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie, ""The Tourist""), Monkey (Jackie Chan, ""The Karate Kid""), Mantis (Seth Rogen, ""Paul""), Viper (Lucy Liu, ""Kill Bill: Volume 1), and Crane (David Cross, ""Megamind""), Po must save kung fu and China. But where would these six be without Dustin Hoffman reprising his role as the wise Master Shifu providing Po with a new challenge to find and master inner peace.The film is all about the visual choices of 2D and 3D animation contrasting flashbacks from Po's present creating colorful, visually pleasant film. This is necessary when showcasing the significant increase in action over the original film. This is rightfully so because this is a film about animals showing off their kung fu fighting skills creating an action movie for kids. Also, the voice actors in this franchise could not have been chosen better. Jack Black is in his element masked by a big cuddly panda backed by the writers holding back the urge to overuse the famous phrase ""Skadoosh"" skillfully waiting for the most epic moment in the film.A weak story comes with sequel territory; therefore, it almost goes without saying that ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" has its plot flaws. However, this does not hurt the film as much as it holds the film back from being great. Instead it has to settle for a good solid predictable flick. In the end the story is not the selling point of the movie and acts as a setup for the third installment of the series leaving the audience with an open ending.Entertaining blockbuster animation at its best placing Jack Black back into his comfort zone as a voice actor within a spectacle of action and color. Perfect timing with the completion of the ""Toy Story"" franchise leaving room for ""Kung Fu Panda"" to grow into something great.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Po is Back,"In this animated sequel, we rejoin Po (Jack Black) and the Furious Five in the routine rescue of a small village being stripped of any metal in their possession. While success appeared a forgone conclusion, something Po observes on an opponent leaves him dumbstruck and sends him flashing back to his childhood. Outraged by his combat failure, the Five and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) inform him that he is not to join them in their duties.Elsewhere, we learn that the party behind the plundering intends to use the metal for raw material in a weapon; a weapon that ""stops kung fu"". Upon hearing that it was a panda that nearly thwarted the effort, he's noticeably unnerved. The reason being that a soothsayer forcibly assisting him long ago told him that a panda would be his undoing. Meanwhile, Po has returned home to his father to unravel the mystery.I don't know if I was expecting a second film after the first one, and it would stand up on it's own without one, but I enjoyed this sequel immensely. The origin story, the identity struggle, the final confrontation and most of the intervening events are highly entertaining. A worthy follow-up.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu...' is a return to awesomeness,"Jack Black returns as the voice of mighty martial-arts panda Po in 'Kung Fu Panda 2', the sequel to that 2008 animated gem. After establishing himself as the Dragon Warrior by vanquishing the evil Tai Lung and retrieving the Dragon Scroll in the earlier film, the new adventure involves Po's search for his identity, and his quest for inner peace. He's pitted against an evil peacock named Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman) who killed his parents when he was a baby, and who is now threatening to conquer China using a fiery canon that will all but end the ancient art of kung fu. Naturally Po's accomplices in this showdown against Lord Shen are the members of the Furious Five, and much of the fun and inventiveness of this film comes from the teamwork between them. Po himself is the star of the show, and those who enjoyed the earlier film will be happy to know there are still plenty of jokes about Po being fat, lazy and constantly hungry. In fact, the very first time we see him in this film, he's accepted a challenge to stuff 40 buns in his mouth. The action scenes are bigger and better than the last time, and the animation itself is exceptional in terms of textures and lighting. Flashback sequences unfold in rich, comic-book style, and a climatic sequence in which Po dodges deadly canon-balls is the most visually arresting set-piece you've seen in an animation film recently. But 'Kung Fu Panda 2' is also a film with heart. There are touching scenes between Po and his adoptive father, and an important message in the end: that inner peace can be attained only by confronting the past, then letting go of it. A very worthy sequel to the first film, 'Kung Fu Panda 2' is a treat for animation lovers. I'm going with three-and-a-half out of five for this return to awesomeness!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
SKADOOSH,"Movies like these need more recognition!!A perfect sequel to the original that was released in 2008. The return of Jack Black reprising his role as Po. Also the return of the Furious 5 which played a bigger role on this rollercoaster than the first! Angelina Jolie has pushed her character foward with her friendship with Po redeeming herself as a whole.Lord Shen, the antagonist played by Oscar Winner Gary Oldman makes a great performance voicing the menacing peacock.This focuses on the conflict of the past as Shen and Po have dark history.As the moral message of the movie, its all about forgiving the past and accepting the present, giving chance for change to occur in others instead of fighting over something that cannot be changed.John Powell and Hans Zimmer have nailed the soundtrack as expected making personal favourites (Zen Ball Master, Po Finds the Truth). Action Sequences made it all so satisfying as the fighting matched with the orchestea drums and beats.Wish that the side characters got more lines as they felt very left out. Regocognition for James Hong, Lucy Liu, David Cross, Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan and Dustin Hoffman)Humour wasn't as good as before but Jack Black's presence made up for it. Tone of red and black ressembled around Shen, surrounded by heated metal gave that strong theme of death making him as more intimidating.Effort of the designers exploring China themselves to get inspiration of buildings and landscape was worth the time, made all the locations the characters visited feel like its a real place.Key Quotes came in strong!""The only thing that matters, is who you choose to be now""
""Anything is possible, when you have inner peace""
""Happiness must be taken, and I will take mine""
""You think knowing will heal you? Fill some crater in your soul?""WORTH THE WATCH.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
How Sequels should be done!!!,"Let me start by saying that while i enjoyed the first Kung Fu Panda (7/10), i cant say its a classic or a masterpiece.Having said that i was expecting the second part to be a way to milk the cow and make as much money as possible. I was totally wrong!The second one manages to keep the quality and in my opinion even improves compared to the first one. Kudos to Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger for delivering a good script.Gary Oldman shows how important the voice actor can be. He gives the villain so much charisma.That cant be said for the rest of the cast... while Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman deliver solid performances, the rest of the cast seems to put in no effort at all and it feels like they are just doing it for the money. On the other hand the producing company seems only to hire them to put some big names on the poster.Anyway this was a really good movie and even though its not a masterpiece, it entertained me enough to make me want to see the third part of the series.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good sequel.,"Really enjoyable film. The animation of this film was an upgrade over the first part. Great action in this one too. This film also has a message what I thought to be really wonderful and mature which elevated this film even further. Was honestly expecting to be disappointed since sequels usually turn out to be bad, but that's not the case here. Initially I thought it was going to be boring with so many unnecessary characters like the wolves and all but then the film really starts to pick up and gets down to the actual story. Overall Kung Fu Panda 2 is quite a lot of fun and a very entertaining movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of my favorite animated movies,"Everything about this movie is excellent. It beats out an already great first film. Better villain, better story, and a great origin story for our main character. The same excellent voice acting from the first film is here with some new excellent voices, especially Gary Oldman as Shen. An excellent movie that I will always have a soft spot for.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
That Was Pretty Hardcore!,"""Your story may not have a happy beginning, but that doesn't make you who you are. It is the rest of your story, who you choose to be."" KFP2 is a combination of human spirituality and a brilliant touch of humor; which is very hard to come by. The story maybe not as original as the first movie but more enthusiastic and entertaining; and above all, the animation are flawless with lots of scintillating Kung Fu action.Here I was watching Kung Fu Panda 2 for the Intermittently-forgotten-TH time at my 26th B'day, right there I got the mood to write something about it. Though I didn't write it instantly as I was through some critic that gave me an emoticon face like :@ as none of them were 100% satisfied with that particular movie. However that didn't lessen my interest instead makes me feel like ""step aside Sire's, I am in a mood."" For the recent 3D-ish spectators, I won't mind stating that I was not lucky enough to watch it on a giant IMAX 3D screen.With an amazing voice crew (including Jack Black as the fluffy panda Po, Angelina Jolie playing the adverse Tigress, Dustin Hoffman as the one smart master Shifu, Gary Oldman this time as the evil Shen and chunky Jackie Chan as the best Monkey around) under the best visual team of DreamWorks studio, this film fires on nearly every cylinder. KFP2 is a visualization of complex hypothetical touch through a fun-flown story. Talking about the hypothetical-term here firstly comes to the mind; is a face of a goat 'The Soothsayer'. It was visible that the future teller Soothsayer enriched the humor revealing his clever appearance like telling lord Shen, ""If you continue on your current path...you will find yourself...at the bottom of the stairs."" or in another conversation like, ""Lord Shen: One panda lives. That does not make you right. The Soothsayer: You're right. Being right makes me right.""Again simply remember master Shifus inner peace. The concept of Inner Peace was presumably created along with Kung Fu by Master Oogway centuries ago. Through meditation, the power of Inner Peace was shown when Oogway's senses were heightened immeasurably. When PO introduced to that spiritual inner peace concept by his master Shifu, what was his instant answer! ""PO: So that's it? I just need inner peace? My innards(Showing his bowl) are already super, super peaceful. So all I need to do is just get this thing going. Inner peace?"" Isn't that super humorous? Anything but the movie was never boring for a moment, because of the comic presence of that panda. Po was cool as usual with his awesomeness of the delivery of quotes like ""I'm not freaking out, I'm freaking in!"" Before Po sets out for Gongmen City with the Furious Five, Shifu's last words to him are, ""Anything is possible when you have Inner Peace.""The fat fluffy panda touched my soul when after much pain and suffering through the encounters with Lord Shen and his own repressed memories, he finds his inner peace in the remains of the village where he was born. By coming to terms with his inner conflict, Po achieves Inner Peace, signified by Po performing his masters final teaching apparently comes in the form of catching a rain drop and redirecting it into the ground without breaking it (Which was an eye comforting visual masterpiece).Most of the conversation between PO and the violent peacock Shen were amusing which makes it different from the first part of the sequel ""Po: Scars heal.Lord Shen: No, they don't. Wounds heal.Po: Oh, right. What do scars do? Fade?""In summary Kung Fu Panda 2 is vigorously fast developed story which includes life lessons and lots of Chinese cultural references with plenty of adorable vibrant animated characters. Before watching it I was confused when many renowned critics hailed KFP2 as a financial disappointment, despite earning more than $660 million worldwide. Yes, it underperformed in the US, grossing a lesser millions, but the film was hardly a mild disappointment. Usually I don't wait for a sequel, but after the film's awesomeness, I can't help but long for at least one more adventure with Po and the gang.After watching some hundreds of IMDb top ranked movies I wrote my first ever review not for FORREST GUMP, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GODFATHER, THE LORD OF THE RINGS or THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, considering the ensuing realization of having an Animation-Geek in myself; even not for the WALLE, TOY STORY or HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON. I choose Kung Fu Panda 2, which was released some three years back.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An epic & heartwarming sequel that is more superior than the original,"After being a fan of the first film, I went to see this in theaters with my brother back at 2011, hoping that it would not disappoint me. Turns out, during the summer of that year, it didn't disappoint me and has been one of my favorite movies that managed to be a lot more superior than the original.Everything is great and it has the same things that made the first so compelling. The characters are as likable as ever. Po is still his hungry self, but he becomes more serious throughout the rest of the movie. While Mantis, Monkey, Crane, and Viper get little to no screen time, Tigress gets some character development in this movie and his interactions with Po is beyond terrific. Master Shifu, whose relationship with Po became the heart of the first film, is a bit underused, but it's great to see him in the film's climax (I'll get to that in a moment).The new characters are great. Lord Shen may be a bit too similar to Tai Lung, but I think he's a cool villain and is easily one of the best. He kicks some butt with his cannons and his connection to Po and that he felt unloved by his parents explains the reason why he's been forcing his wolves to make them in the first place. His motives are great and Gary Oldman's creepy voice work explains; not to mention he has a great sense of humor. His henchman, the Wolf Boss, is great and his menacing appearance was so intense. Master Ox, Master Croc, and Master Rhino aren't given much to, but it's great to see them in action. The Soothsayer, the fortune telling goat, reminds me a lot of Rafiki from The Lion King, but the way she explains Lord Shen's reasons for murdering his panda family is good and while having a sense of humor, there's a creepy atmospheric feel about her.The voice acting is great and it's awesome to Jack Black, Gary Oldman, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross, and Seth Rogen return along with some new ones. The action is great and the script is smart and strong much like the original film. The dialog is also sharp and witty at the same time.The animation is great. The character designs are as solid as ever with realistic emotions and the texture of their fur is fabulous. The visuals are the strongest point in the animation. The Jade Palace and the Valley of Peace is beautiful and so is Gongmen City and Lord Shen's palace.The best part, however, would have to go to the story. It's as emotional as the first and while it has bits of elements from that film, it continues the story and adds Po's back-story, which made me felt sorry for him it would leave you teary-eyed. It has a nice moral about having the rest of your story and that life goes on forever.Overall, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a solid sequel with complex themes and a mature story line. With the anticipation for the third film coming in two more years, I will never stop watching this and the original film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Prepare for the return of awesomeness,"Po is now living his dream as The Dragon Warrior, protecting the Valley of Peace alongside his friends and fellow kung fu masters, The Furious Five. But Po's new life of awesomeness is threatened by the emergence of a formidable villain, who plans to use a secret, unstoppable weapon to conquer China and destroy kung fu. Po must look to his past and uncover the secrets of his mysterious origins; only then will he be able to unlock the strength he needs to succeed. -- (C) DreamworksKUNG FU PANDA 2 is an example of a sequel that surpasses it's predecessor. Instead of repeating the plot of the first film, the creative minds behind this sequel made the rightful decision to continue expanding Po's emotional story, in this case meaning that we finally find out Po's origin story. By doing this, KUNG FU PANDA 2 feels much more emotionally involving than the first, and it just goes to show you that Dreamworks Animation have matured in the past few years, although PUSS IN BOOTS looks like it'll bring the studio back a few steps.With that being said, the film does suffer from having too many things going on at once, as if afraid that it'll bore the kids in the audience. The film moves at an lightening speed and, before you know it, the credits are rolling right in front of you. Part of this is due to the film's amazing narrative economy. For example, in the first few minutes, we have already learned the villain's origin story told in a fairytale kind of way with Michelle Yeoh as the narrator, à la THE MUMMY: TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR. I just wished the film took its time in certain parts because the film could have certainly been better if we had time to breathe.As with most sequels, everything is bigger in KUNG FU PANDA 2. This includes the action sequences, which are amazing, stunning, and wildly imaginative, all enhanced by the 3D technology and the gorgeous cinematography. The 3D also provides amazing depth in almost every scene and moments of pop out gimmicks. With a bigger scope and the ability of animators to manipulate everything on screen, the extra dimension is certainly worth the extra cost. Hans Zimmer's score is terrific as usual, continuing the theme from the first film.I also liked the villain a lot, the peacock Shen, voiced by the great Gary Oldman. The character is fleshed out more than your usual 2D villain, and he was pretty bad ass. Jack Black continues to prove that he's a great voice actor and provides the charm of the film with the lovable Po. His relationship with Angelina Jolie's Tigress is explored further in here as well, and it'll be interesting to see where they'll end up in the next sequel. I also liked the addition of Michelle Yeoh, who's pretty much great in everything she's in.The wicked fast pace doesn't ruin the film, but slowing it down could have made it better. While not an amazing sequel, KUNG FU PANDA 2 is still better than the first film. With a great visual sense of wonder, funny jokes, and fantastic action sequences, this is an entertaining and emotionally involving sequel that branches out the story from the first film. In 2D or 3D, do yourself a favor and just go watch it. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Sequel With Heart,"To be honest, I've always like the sequel to every single Dreamworks movie that had a sequel more than the original. For example, as much as I loved Shrek, I loved Shrek 2 more. I hated Madagascar but found Madagascar 2 pretty enjoyable to watch. And it's no exception that I actually liked Kung Fu Panda 2 more than Kung Fu Panda (which I thought that although it was good, it was a tad bit overrated).Kung Fu Panda 2 talks about Po (Jack Black) teaming up with the Furious Five to defeat their new enemy, a peacock by the name of Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), who created a weapon that could destroy kung fu and the whole of China. The problem now is ""how can kung fu stop something that stops kung fu?"" That and Po has some daddy issues.But after watching Kung Fu Panda 2, I realised what makes a sequel so great. Just like Toy Story 2, they never made their characters go to level zero again and learn everything from the start. Po can kick butt right from the beginning of the movie. Like he is a total pro which is very cool since a lot of movies tend to make their main character who the main character was in the first film. Instead, they move on to the next level and answer some unanswered questions in the first film or bring up some new questions for the viewers to ponder over. And, this is by far my favourite sequel out of all the Dreamworks movie in terms of a sequel (I still liked Shrek 2 more). It was a vast improvement of the original in terms of heart, story and visuals.Po is still as likable as ever. Jack Black did a surprisingly fantastic job at the dramatic scenes. I actually forgave him for that horrid movie that my friend dragged me to watch ""Gulliver's Travel"". I mean, that movie was just terrible! But I learnt that Black is a pretty good actor if given the right script. I enjoyed his presence. He made Po so funny and energetic but so vulnerable at the same time.Gary Oldman as Lord Shen was as good as I predicted it to be. That man is fantastic in everything he does, that's all I need to say. I found Shen to be a very interesting villain. He has his sad backstory and you feel for him. You don't root for him but he's basically a Tai Lung from the first movie. He's a three-dimensional character and I was appreciate a villain that's 3 dimensional Beside Tigress, the Furious Five didn't have much lines but really loved their team dynamic in this film. Team Furious Five and Po! And Shifu and Mr Ping are as awesome as they are in the previous movie I loved the Tai Lung/Shifu backstory. That was the reason why Shifu was my favourite character in the whole Kung Fu Panda series (even though he made a very brief appearance in this movie). However, though it made me feel for both characters, I never felt the urge to cry. Heart-wrenching as it was, it never pushed your emotions any further. KFP 2 is different. When you find out what happened to Po (though the story was, admittedly, not original), you can't help but feel your heart being punched a thousand times and your tears are just threatening to fall down (and that's not good since I was watching it in 3D, which was superb and I would get on that later on). On the last note on the story's heart, loved Po and Mr Ping's relationship.Visually, it was.... stunning. I mean, it's Dreamworks. Although they've got a bad record of making terrible movies (which I didn't think were THAT bad), their animation has always been very impressive. And they just keep improving with every single new film. Kung Fu Panda 2 is no exception. 3D: It wasn't dark and it was effective. I recommend 3D but it'll be fine if you don't watch it in 3D too.Take note, though, that the humour in this movie was not as good as the humour in the first. Mostly because they replaced the humour with heart. Fortunately, this movie is well-balanced out between the humour and the emotional point of the story. And not one part funny and then sad and then funny again.Now here's a very interesting part to this film: The climax was just... wow. You would expect some big bad explosions with Po fighting off thousands of evil bad guys. But, no. The climax was nothing like that (though he does fight off hundreds of evil bad guys in the film for those who really want to see that happening). The climax was surprisingly.... a character moment. They never tried to do anything big (okay, to a certain extent, i guess it was pretty ""big""). The climax was really all about Po and what he had learnt. And it was really really satisfying. I was just sitting there going, ""Wow.... I LOVE this movie"" And it really proves to me that this movie never tried the ""bigger is better"" ploy. The climax was basically what the whole movie was about: The main character and the emotions that he was struggling with and I really respect the filmmakers for such a wise decision.And I am really looking forward to the 3rd movie!

Prepare for the return of awesomeness,"I liked the first movie Kung Fu Panda (2008) which was one of DreamWorks's best movies, with its great voice acting, well-done 3D animation, fun action, and likable characters; with the sequel you hope it is as good or better than the first movie, and after watching it, you can say that it is a great sequel that expands on the world it built in the first movie and dives more into the main character's backstory. The sequel Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) is as good if not better than the first movie, with great character development of the main character, fun action, great 3D animation, a threatening villain, and great voice acting; this movie makes the main character Po more interesting with where he came from, and makes the backstory connects to the villain in some great way that is investing to watch.Jack Black is once again great as the character Po, with him getting a very interesting backstory that connects to the main villain that he is learning throughout the movie, and having character development when it comes to accepting it and finding inner peace; he was funny, interesting, and cool to watch now used to being in the Dragon Warrior role but also learning new things. The group the Furious Five once Tigress, Monkey, Viper, Crane, and Mantis played great again by Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross, and Seth Rogen going on the journey with Po to stop the villain, with there being lots of scenes where they work great together as a team in lots of big action sequences; there are also great moments between Po and Tigress with many interactions between them as friends. Lastly, you have some nice appearances of Shifu again voiced by Dustin Hoffman, telling Po about inner peace and how he can you use it to his advantage and just overall how to keep being the Dragon Warrior.The villain Shen voiced great by Gary Oldman was an intimidating but funny villain that has an interesting backstory to him on why he is trying to take over China, and he has some kind of connection to Po's backstory and where he came from, making a great hero villain dynamic between them when they are both in the same scene interacting off each other. The action sequences are fun, fast paced, and cool to watch with the great 3D animation that gets you invested in what is happening and great visuals, along with the many details on the characters and the pretty looking backgrounds/locations; though the movie is very funny to watch, the movie has quite a few emotional/heartfelt moments that are well-done and can make you tear up when watching.The sequel Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) was a worthy second movie to the first, making this movie good if not better than the first movie, because of the great voice acting, well-done character development, a great villain, fun action sequences, nice looking 3D animation, and an interesting way to flesh out the Po character by giving him an interesting backstory; if you liked the first Kung Fu Panda (2008), then you will have a great time with this sequel. Lastly, DreamWorks made a great sequel to an already great first movie, which leads to the third movie; I am going to remember this movie and want to watch it repeatedly like the first.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesomeness,"This sequel is absolutely phenomenal, building on the foundation of the first film while deepening both the story and character development. Po returns better trained and more skilled, yet still true to himself - a goofy, laid-back panda who avoids exerting himself unless truly necessary. What makes this installment stand out is its exploration of Po's internal conflict and emotional growth. Beneath his cheerful exterior, Po struggles with unresolved feelings about his past and his identity, showcasing a vulnerability he tries hard to hide.The dynamic between Po and Tigress also evolves beautifully. There's a palpable bond between them that hints at mutual respect and burgeoning affection. Tigress, typically stoic and fierce, shows a gentler side when it comes to Po, and it's heartwarming to see their connection develop throughout the movie.The internal journey Po faces - reconciling his past while striving to find his ""inner peace"" - adds a meaningful emotional layer to the film. His quest for understanding and acceptance elevates the narrative beyond simple action. This conflict mirrors the broader theme of balance between strength and serenity, a lesson Po learns and demonstrates masterfully.The final battle was breathtaking in both action and symbolism. Po's ability to deflect Shen's cannon fire with grace and peace encapsulates the essence of his growth. However, I feel that the climax could have leaned more into its serious undertones. The comedic elements, while entertaining, slightly undermined the gravity of the moment. Imagine Po closing his eyes, fully immersed in his newfound inner peace, showing us that spiritual awakening in a solemn and focused way - it would have been the perfect capstone to his journey.Still, the blend of humor, action, and emotion works wonderfully. Kung Fu Panda 2 successfully balances comedy with a more mature narrative, making it not just a great sequel but one that stands on its own as a thoughtful story about growth, forgiveness, and self-acceptance.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was indeed the return of awesomeness!,"""Return of the Awesomeness."" It was indeed the return of the awesomeness. First Kung Fu Panda was really damn good. They had good characters, good story and of course good humor. So, what do you expect in the sequel of the film? It really lived to it's tag line though it didn't lived my expectations because it went BEYOND. The story follows the dragon warrior - Po and the furious five; Tigress, Viper, Crane, Mantis and Monkey in their journey trying to save Kung Fu from the evil Lord Shen - who invented a new weapon that could end Kung Fu. The evil lord returned in making his plan into a reality with the help of this new weapon to end kung fu and conquer China after being banished by his father. Then later, Po realizes that the evil lord may or may have not done something in his missing childhood memories and he began to question himself 'Who is he?' I don't wanna spoil so better watch it. Kudos to the whole team behind this movie. I loved how they put a very good sense of humor. Plus, the comedic timing of everyone was great! And you can see that the characters really matured especially Po. Casting of the voices in the new characters were great too. And the I liked the fact that in some scenes you can't feel it 3D - unless you want it 3D the whole time and regretting it later for the soring of your eyes. They really did a good job on the effects, animations and colors were freaking great! it's 10 over 10 movie for me :)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A fanda the Panda,"You know how tough it can be to follow up a truly well-done movie, especially an animated one. I think Kung Fu Panda 2 surpasses the original, and it's because it introduces some heretofore unseen layers of Po while combining some contrasting animation styles. It's expertly directed by Jennifer Yuh and features the returning voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, and others.In this installment, the Dragon Warrior panda Po (Black) is now teamed with the Furious Five, defending the town from evil doers. Exposition tells us of the banished son of the old king and queen, peacocks, who became prideful and menacing, and now he's back to avenge his parents' treatment of him and to take over China - and, by extension, the world. This son, Shen (Gary Oldman) plans to do this by using fireworks as weapons to usher out the era of kung fu. Meanwhile, Po comes to realize that he is not the natural son of his father, the goose (James Hong). Don't ask why this is news.During flashbacks, we get to see what tiny snippets of Po's childhood emerge in his subconscious. He was placed by his mother in a pot of radishes and found by Mr. Ping (Hong). But why was he left there? What happened to his parents? Does Shen hold some of the answers? Probably. For - not a spoiler - it has been foretold that Shen will be defeated by a black-and-white warrior, by the local soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh). Shen knows this, Po does not.So much to like about this movie. In those flashbacks, Yuh uses an entirely different style of animation, mostly black and white, to underline the intensity of the scenes. It's reminiscent of the O-Ren Ishii's flashback scenes in Kill Bill, come to think of it. Dazzling and detailed, these scenes are emotional and provocative. A little more than you'd expect from a kids' film, but trust me when I say that the scenes are well done and by no means dwell on violence. They're tense, but not truly intense.Po himself takes on a role exuding more confidence and leadership. He's not just a bumbling panda this time around. He is a little quicker, a little smarter, although just as unwieldy and ungainly. He lends the team both clear vision and witty repartee. Although he's just as big as ever, he's become more agile and more thoughtful, more inclined to listen to Master Shifu (Hoffman) and Tigress (Jolie) than before. This makes the action scenes - and there are some terrific ones - honestly compelling.It's nice to see everyone resuming their old roles, even if actors like David Cross, Jackie Chan, and Lucy Liu get short shrift (someone has to). It's Po's story. Importantly, I never felt as if this was an example of stunt casting, as each actor seems to be fitting for his or her role.Be warned, though - the movie, like most animated films, does have its hankie moments. Here, they come at the very end, and they are as beautiful and touching as the rest of the film is charming and invigorating. The denouement offers a fitting coda for this masterful film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The legend of awesomeness continues.,"I've seen 'Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011)' many times over the years, and each time I've felt differently about it. For some reason, I've never been all that enthusiastic about it... until today. It's great. While it isn't as strong as its predecessor (very little is), it's a really entertaining and well-rounded experience that's every bit as funny, exciting and emotionally affecting as you'd hope. That last point is actually the flick's most unexpected - and arguably successful - element; I don't think anyone would think a sequel to a film about a silly, kung fu fighting panda would include a devastating backstory involving pseudo genocide and an abandoned baby that genuinely gives your tear ducts something to do. The emotional journey that Po goes on is really satisfying, not to mention surprisingly mature, and it drives the whole narrative in a way that makes every scene seem entirely necessary. The characters are given just the right amount of attention and come out as complete individuals because of it, their arcs feeding into the central themes in increasingly fulfilling ways. The prophecy-paranoid villain, in particular, is a fantastic foil to the go-with-the-flow hero, and the fact that every action he takes to avoid his fate only further cements its inevitability is really powerful. It helps that he's played by the amazing Gary Oldman, who goes full tilt and delivers an entertaining performance that's equally as frightening as it is scene-chewing. The other voice work is all great, of course, but Oldman stands out as the highlight, followed closely by the perfectly cast Jack Black. On top of all its story success, the picture is just an absolute blast filled with expertly crafted action scenes. It's really well paced, and is also proprely funny on more than one occasion. The colourful visuals are beautiful and the iconic score is as transcendent as ever. Ultimately, this is a brilliant sequel that's well crafted in every area. It isn't as good as the first one, but it's a still joy throughout. It's a delight.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesomeness times two.,"Dreamworks is at it again! ""Kung Fu Panda"" was one heck of a big hit and when news of a sequel came up, I was fairly excited. Most of the same cast is back and are thrown into an adventure unlike any other. Get ready to feel the thunder because this is Kung Fu Panda 2.Po the panda is now officially the new Dragon Warrior and is currently living the dream. However, a new threat bigger than Tai Lung has emerged and threatens not only the existence of kung fu, but also all of China. That threat is Lord Shen, a deadly albino peacock (Gary Oldman) who leads an army of wolves and gorillas, has possession of a weapon the world has never seen, and shares a mysterious and traumatic link to our hero's past. Po and the Furious Five (Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane, and Viper) must find a way to stop the evil Lord Shen from taking over China once and for all with all the skill and awesomeness they have.It's great to see the old gang come back like Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Lui, etc. Likewise, we have an all new group of actors coming into the fray: Gary Oldman (Lord Shen), Michelle Yeoh (Soothsayer), Jean-Claude Van Damme (Master Croc), etc. There's a lot more action going on and it's pretty intense. The jokes are still a load of fun, guaranteed to make you laugh at least a few times. The story is actually more complex and a little darker than what we're used to from these kinds of movies, with emotions from some the characters being conveyed quite well.Lord Shen has become one of my favorite movie villains of all time, being fairly complex and having a deadly combination of both brawn and brain. Being an albino peacock makes him seem like an unlikely threat, which helps to hide his sinister nature. What makes even more great is his connection with Po, which is something that is sure to shake things up a little bit and raise the stakes for our heroes.I would have liked to see characters like Master Croc have a bigger role in the plot, but there's nothing I can do. Overall, this is one of those sequels that surpasses the originals. Wonderfully done and I look forward to more sequels. Check it out. Skidoosh!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of best films i have ever watched,"This film i find genuinely brilliant, it has amazing action, comedy and a suprisingly deep plot. This film is all about Po and his past. His tragic past is slowly uncovered until the big reveal moment where he re lives what happend. This sceane i find so incredible it always brings a tear to my eye. The film suddenly becomes very serious and i love it. As an adult the film is completly different compared to as a kid. Understanding the evil that shen has done similar to many other dictators. The film also references the industrial reveloution in china which is very intresting.Overall amazing film for literally anyone young or old. My favourite film by far.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Although it is an animated film by Americans,but it is one of the best animated films ""in China"".","As a China native, I like the ip of Kung Fu Panda very much. Among the four films, Kung Fu Panda 2 impressed me the most. In China, Kung Fu Panda 2 also got a good evaluation. On Douban, a China website similar to imdb, Kung Fu Panda 2 got a very high score of 8.1.Whether it is the opening shadow play or the use of Chinese painting in the story, the film is very wonderful. Music is also amazing. It's really full of praise.In Kung Fu Panda 2, other cultures are no longer simply appropriated by Americans-Just like Disney often adapts stories from other cultures, but it is just a simple misappropriation of other cultures. Kung Fu Panda 2 really understood the ideology of China culture, and made many China people agree with this film. Po's avoidance of the past suggests that he is not as clumsy as he seems,but deliberately uses eating and drinking to cover up his fear of the past. At this point, he and Shen have the same effect, and both live in the shadow of the past. It's really full of praise and Po are so similar, but so opposite. They are mirrors of each other. They are destined enemies. As occidentals knows, Yin and Yang. It's just that Po finally found peace in his heart. These are basically not specifically expressed in lines, but run through the plot for the audience to experience. China culture pays attention to returning to the original, and it pays attention to being rigid without desire and being soft. So When Po recalled the past and calmed his heart, Po achieved the unity of heaven and man. Although Kung Fu Panda 2's story is relatively simple, they know how to rely on music, and the picture also expresses the artistic conception of the story, not just telling the story for no reason. The team that produced Kung Fu Panda 2 understood China culture and knew how to use it. That's why Kung Fu Panda 2 won such a high evaluation in China. Therefore, after watching Kung Fu Panda 2, many people in China will get such a high evaluation for such a touching, dark but warm film.I know why some people don't like Kung Fu Panda 2. They think they know a lot about China culture, but in fact they don't understand China culture at all and don't want to care about China culture. They just want to see an family fun story in China's skin. So when a movie full of real China culture appears, they hate it. Because They can't understand the ideology conveyed in the film.Some people don't want dark content in animation (they are not good for children to watch, although dark plot is necessary for the story). They only hope that Po can use cartoon funny ways to solve the enemy.As for these comments, I just want to say that they neither understand China culture nor have any aesthetics.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A strong point of this film is that it's not all about Po and his stomach, we get to some touching stories about Po's past and other masters of Kung Fu .

Dreamworks is on fire!,"Kung Fu Panda 2 is just as awesome as the more recent Dreamworks masterpieces like Megamind and How to Train Your Dragon, and like Madagascar 2, it by far surpasses the original.With less focus on slapstick, and more on the story, the characters and the animation, Dreamworks is on a roll. The action sequences had superb animation. They weaved 2D animation in with the 3D when exploring the past; and the especially significant scenes had a great ""epic"" feeling about them, which was perfectly complemented by the brilliant comic timing and witty humor. And the movie was surprisingly touching at times, which was possible this time perhaps because the story involved Po's past and so the events of the movie had a much greater emotional impact on him. It also had a star studded cast, so the voice acting was excellent - especially Gary Oldman's, who played the villain.I can't believe I was actually debating on whether to go watch this in the theater. I was especially shocked to hear some people actually cried watching it, and that caught my interest. It was a two-and-a-half-hours well spent, and they showed us Baby Po!

What can I say...they were Kung fu fighting,"Awesome film, not only dose it build of the first film but adds new prospective to pos story. Won't spoil much but has a very mennising and has a well built cherecter. The fact that they ballence so many different feelings on a few cherecters is remarkable. The story isn't only the thing worth watching for, the action is some of the best I've seen in all animation. The red esthetic every time villans are on screen adds so much more tension then it eould of had. The movie doesn't baby the audience either, it is a dark story about losing what you love and revenge. I also don't feel like anybody in the movie has plot armor, every scene I feel like the cherecters could meet their end.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The return of Awesomeness INDEED!,"WOW. Thats the only word i uttered during my KUNG FU PANDA 2 experience, Im confident that you will be the same. The visuals are unparallelled, the story is as touching as Toy Story 3 and the main character every bit as lovable as he was in his first outing. Jack Black returns to the role I'm sure will be what he will always be remembered for, Po the Panda. The all star voice cast is by the far the highlight, with everyone involved being given the chance to have a bit more fun with their respective characters. The story, to which i wont go into too much detail, follows Po on his journey for inner peace, and to take down evil Peacock, LORD SHEN. Comedy ensues, as does (quite surprisingly) a whole lot of heart and the best animated fight scenes to date. Loved everything about this movie. Highly recommended. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic,"Jack Black returns as the Kung Fu master, voiced by Po, in the sequel to the popular animated film. Po is now a recognized warrior and local hero, alongside Tigress and Angelina Jolie. He must save China from a new enemy, the evil peacock Lord Shen. Po also faces a personal demon, the mystery of his birth as the son of a local restaurateur, a goose named Mr Ping. The film is enjoyable, but may not appeal to the younger audience due to the lack of adult sophistication. Despite this, it is a great-looking animation and a nice entertainment, targeting a younger audience without the extra level of adult sophistication. Kung Fu Panda 2 is essentially gentle, similar to the last film, and may appeal to audiences who are tired of wiseacre quasi-adult material in family animations. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is an elegant and engaging sequel to the popular animated film. The story is more involving than the original, and the animation is boundless. The 3-D technology adds an extra layer of excitement, making it a more ambitious extension of the original. One of the new elements is the explanation of how Mr. Ping, a goose, could be the biological father of Po, a panda. This explanation is based on new developments in the kingdom, rather than a retread of the original film. The sequel is a testament to the power of 3-D technology in storytelling. In the sequel to Dragon Warrior, Po leads the Furious Five, including Tigress, Mantis, Monkey, Viper, and Crane. Tigress is the most formidable, while Mantis remains enigma. The kingdom faces potential conquest and rule by the evil peacock Lord Shen, who has designed a new weapon to scour the land for scrap iron. Shen, wielding sharp feathers, is a wicked foe. The mystery of Po's parentage is explained by Lord Shen's paranoia after a soothsayer warns him to beware of pandas, revealing their destinies are deeply linked. The film explores the complexities of power dynamics and the complexities of human relationships. DreamWorks' Kung Fu Panda 3 is a thrilling film that competes with Pixar. The animation is superior to typical 3-D animated features, but the distortion caused by 3-D effects can be unfavorable. The story features a humorous character named Po, with Jack Black's voicing adding more personality than expected. Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson broadens the animation to include more styles than traditional cartoon animals, and the imaginary sequences involving Po's history are beautiful. Voice-over work is now a crucial part of an actor's repertory, with Dustin Hoffman excelling as a guru named Shifu. As he grows older, Hoffman masters the timing and inflection of a smart stand-up comic, making his voice-over work a gift.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Phenomenal sequel,This is indeed the best animated sequel ever. The thing I like about in this and Shrek 2 is that it expands the universe and changing the location. Lord Shen is the most darkest and greatest villain dreamworks ever made. Po's backstory is oh my god that scene is in S tier. The soundtrack by Zimmer and John Powell my god they were absolute perfection. The final battle will always remain my favourite scene. I absolute love the darker and emotional tone. The things I kinda wished is that Shen's backstory should have been more detailed about how his parents gave him like sort of lack of attention thus making him believe that they didn't loved him and Master Ox and Croc should have gotten more screentime. Overall this movie will always be my favourite sequels ever.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda 2,"Kung Fu Panda 2 is the second film in the Kung Fu Panda franchise. It is about where Po came from and what happened to the other pandas. It also brings more of the concept of inner peace, of which is something everyone should strive for. That's kinda an extension of the first one, of which the first film is about believing in yourself that you can do something, then this one inner peace is believing you can achieve it.I prefer the villain in this one as he has more of a personal connection to Po (as Tai Wan did have more of a connection to Master Shifu than Po, though Chen has more of one to Po). Po is clearly the character the series is most about and it seems better if the villain has more of a personal connection with him than another Kung Fu fighter.Overall I do find it as good as the first.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty Good Movie,"Rating: 7.8
Overall, a pretty good sequel as the film has a lot of the same charm as the first one and builds on some of the roots planted for Po's journey, but the movie does not feel as unique because its story construction is a little too close to its predecessor.Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale is very good as they once again take a simple plot and make the most out of it, going above and beyond with more vibrant visuals and grand fighting scenes; the direction on a microscale is good as it feels like a continuation of where the last film left off, with its comedy and Po still trying to find himself; direction of actors is good as it felt like most of the performances picked up where they left off last time, and the new performances were executed well; the storytelling is still pretty formulaic for a children's movie (borderline copying the same template as last time)), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Great from Jack Black (Carries off where he left off last time as it still feels like they wrote this character for Jack Black), Good from Dustin Hoffman (Carries off where he left off last time as he still has very good chemistry with Jack Black, but his talent is used a lot less this time around), Good from Gary Oldman (Feels like Gary Oldman is using his experience as a villain to carry out his role (especially his work from 'Léon: The Professional')), Very Good from James Hong (Continues where he left off as he gives the character a lot of life and helps show the father-son dynamic between Mr. Ping and Po, and it once again felt like the character was written for him), Pretty Good from Angelina Jolie (Carries off where she left off as she still is given the biggest role out of the Furious Five, and does a good job at not only being distant towards Po but having a connection with him as well), Pretty Good to Good from Michelle Yeoh (Basically just plays herself but has good chemistry with both Jack Black and Gary Oldman), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Once again, everyone plays their role well, but it just feels like a lot of their talent is underutilized (especially the remaining members of the Furious Five))), Pretty Good to Good Story (The concept is good as it uses the sequel template well to show Po continuing his journey and having to confront new conflicts/doubt in his life, and the movie continues its uses of ancient Chinese culture/wuxia; the plot structure is laid out almost identically to the first, but this is fine as it is still not overcomplicated because there is one simple conflict and they use the short runtime to resolve this effectively; the flow between sequences is good as the movie does not waste any time with its short runtime; character writing is pretty good as it continues to portray Po as someone who is multifaceted and needs to block out doubt to find inner-peace, but the villain writing is not as strong as he felt kinda forced and generic), Good Screenplay (The dialogue is once again written for children to enjoy more than adults, but they still try to push the limit in what they can say; the humor is pretty good as it's quirky and playful (with many moments that adults can enjoy); the symbolism is still prevalent as the movie is a giant message for finding inner-peace with past traumas; the foreshadowing is pretty standard for a children's movie), Good Score (Continues a lot of the same themes as the last movie, and it is still used well throughout the movie; still does a good job at incorporating ancient Chinese themes), Good to Very Good Editing (Really shines in the scenes where they mix animation styles as well as the fighting scenes; a good amount of the cuts felt seamless), Good Sound, Great Animation (Builds on the previous film as many of the action sequences feel more vibrant and grand, while still having the same charm as the first movie), , , , , , Pacing is very good for its short runtime as every scene feels intended and the right length, Climax is executed well as it shows off the film's great animation as well as Po obtaining the message of the movie, Tone is pretty similar to the first movie as it shares a lot of tones with other children's animated/Dreamworks films (while still having tones that echoed wuxia and ancient China), It feels like they tried to make the same movie again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A joyful, glorious animated adventure . . . especially in 2D.","""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a joyful, glorious animated adventure, fast moving, quick-witted, and a lot more fun then I had expected. The animation is crisp and beautiful - more-so in lovely 2D - and clearly shows the advances of the art form. Here is a movie that isn't simply a clone stamp of the original but actually expands on its story and its characters to create something really special.The previous film simply dealt with the cheerfully goofy panda hero Po (voice of Jack Black), discovering his destiny though the art of Kung Fu and being groomed to become The Dragon Master. That adventure was fun, but not exactly deep. It was an odd mixture of Chinese folklore and western 21st century sensibilities. It was jarring, but now that I have gotten use to that odd union, the sequel is a little easier to swallow.The story this time is a little heavier and far better. Po, as the movie opens, has begun to wonder about his past especially since his father Mr. Ping is a goose (voiced by James Hong). Po decides that there may be some need-to-know information. The answer comes from a problem that is looming over the land, an army led by an evil knife-throwing peacock named Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman) who possesses a new element called gunpowder and intends to use it to dominate all of China and wipe out the art of Kung Fu. Shen knows the secrets of Po's past and our furry hero determines to uncover the truth.So, Po amasses his Kung Fu fighting force, The Furious Five, which includes Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie), Mantis (voiced by Seth Rogan), Viper (voiced by Lucy Liu), Monkey (voiced by Jackie Chan) and Crane (voiced by David Cross). The joy of the characters in this sequel is that they are given more screen time and a little more depth, especially Tigress who is a fearsome warrior and may, in some future sequel, win Po's heart. I also loved the presence once again of Po's master, the red panda Shifu, voiced beautifully by Dustin Hoffman. Shifu has much less screen time in this sequel, but his brief scenes are really touching.What is special about ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is that it doesn't just repeat the formula of the original but takes its characters onto a much larger canvas. Po's search for his real parentage is deep and quite moving, told in flashbacks using some really beautiful hand-drawn animation. That story is connected to the main plot with Shen, who is a wonderful movie villain. Here is an evil white peacock with an erudite manner and an evil presence. We might be inclined to laugh at the possibility of an evil peacock but, in the world of this movie, it works.The action scenes are breathtaking. When the characters fly through the air, there is a sense of depth and balance and weight. The action scenes, unlike so many these days, are fast-paced without ever becoming just a series of confusingly edited shots. We understand where the characters are in relation to one another and we know what is at stake. The animators really seem to have thought out these scenes and figured out how to make them special, not routine.There are moments in the film of startling originality especially a great comic moment when Po must sneak through town to the tower that houses Shen's army. He uses one of those parade dragon costumes to get himself and his Furious Five past the guards. When he needs to speak to someone with information, Po has the dragon simply drag them inside the costume by gobbling them up. When he must fight an enemy guard without being detected, the dragon gobbles him up, and the costume drops him out the other end. There are at least two dozen moments like that, my favorite being a scene in which the portly Po faces his arch nemesis: a flight of stairs.Seeing the movie is 2D was a breath of fresh air. The 3D process tends to get in the way, making the scenes look muddy and dark. Watching the movie without the intrusion, I was able to focus on the beauty of the animation. There are wonderful textures on the surfaces and on the characters. When we get a close-up of Po's fur, it is finely detailed so that we can see the individual hairs. More than that, the faces are wonderfully expressive, not just in eyes that open and close, but in pure emotion.Some may think that I am overpraising this film, but I can only report how I felt. I settled into my seat and kind of knew what I was getting. Having seen the original, with its vision of China completely populated by various types of animals, I was ready for this one. It does what great sequels do, it moves past its original concept and broadens the horizons of its story possibilities. It offers new sights to see and new characters to behold. I enjoyed this movie, much more than I expected.",,Anonymous,Animation
Animations are violent!,"If I had kids I would not let them watch most of the cartoons or animation movies. It has been said a lot that these kind of movies or even cartoons on TV on Saturday are teaching kids to be violent and be more of troublemakers. This is why kids bully other kids. This is why we have terrorists. Sorry, whoever wants to say whatever about this. I would keep my kids away. When they are not old enough to know not to do what a movie shows, then they should not be watching. Everything is an example to kids when they are young.Why do they follow their parents when they are young?, because they are the examples. I got out of watching these things when I was around 8.",,Anonymous,Animation
Po fights for all of China...,"Oddly enough I never really got around to watch the ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies before years after they were initially released, and that was because I am not really much of a fan of Jack Black.But after I finally got around to watching the first ""Kung Fu Panda"", then I did indeed decide to sit down to watch parts 2 and 3.The storyline in ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" was actually quite entertaining, and there was a good amount of comedy in the animated movie as well, just as in the other two movies in the franchise.""Kung Fu Panda 2"" has some very great art style to the animation, and it does have somewhat of a unique Asian touch to it, which adds to the believability to it.There are some very colorful characters in ""Kung Fu Panda 2"", and here I am not just referring to the color choices for the characters. The various characters in this animated movie have lots of quirks and unique character traits, which make them quite memorable.It is, of course, very important for an animated movie to have good voice acting, and ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" does indeed have that. But not only does it have good voice acting, but it has a very impressive ensemble of voice actors on the list, which includes Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Gary Oldman, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, James Hong, Michelle Yeoh and Jean-Claude Van Damme to mention but a few.""Kung Fu Panda 2"" turned out to be rather enjoyable and entertaining, and I was more than genuinely entertained by the overall movie. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a movie that is suitable for viewing by both adults and children alike.",,Anonymous,Animation
Shame shame shame,"What a disappointment, I was looking forward to this, the original being one of my favorite animations. This sequel however suffers from having no soul and no comedy. Everything uttered from po's mouth seems contrived and predictable.the action scenes, although filled with complicated fight scenes and gorgeous colors, lack the poetry and comedy of the original. There is no way of connecting with po in this film, it doesn't seem like he is on a journey you can relate too and the villain, though voiced well, is incomparable to the villain of the first movie.For me its just big disappointment, and its score on IMDb is ridiculous.",,Anonymous,Animation
"A Rollicking, Ravishing & Riveting Second Chapter That Lives Up To Its Hype.","Making excellent use of all the ingredients that made its predecessor an instant classic, the follow- up chapter to Kung Fu Panda is another rollicking, ravishing & riveting adventure that lives up to its hype, adds more depth & flesh to the arcs of all reprising characters, further expands the world we dived into in the first film, and is a worthy sequel that even surpasses the original in few aspects.The story of Kung Fu Panda 2 presents Po now living his fulfilled dream, serving as the Dragon Warrior, & protecting the valley with his fellow kung fu warriors whom he once idolised. His latest adventure begins when Lord Shen returns from exile with a fearsome new weapon & has plans of conquering all of China, following which Po & his friends attempt to stop him before he could destroy the entire kung fu tradition.Directed by Jennifer Yuh in what is her directional debut, the film begins on a promising note with a prologue that quickly briefs us through the villain's background & how all of it is connected to Po's very own past, after which it dives into the present and sets the stage relatively quick, just like the previous feature. For a first attempt, Yuh's direction is highly commendable for she exhibits a very firm grip on all aspects.The writing staff does an equally impressive job with the script by further evolving the characters' arcs, brilliantly balancing the elements of comedy, drama & action in one tightly-structured story & putting up a better sketch of the Chinese culture. The computer animation is lively, zestful & more complex than before, thanks to its energetic camera-work, rich colour tones & apt lighting that give its images a vivacious look n feel.Editing is carried out amazingly well for its 90 minutes of narrative is expertly paced yet there are a couple of moments it could've done without. The flashback sequences are brought to life with care and a few of those segments are genuinely touching. Hans Zimmer & John Powell contribute with a familiar yet improved score. And Jack Black plus the rest of the reprising cast deliver exactly what was expected from them while the new additions are no slouch in their given roles.On an overall scale, Kung Fu Panda 2 heads into a slightly darker territory but it never discards the effervescent wit, unbridled passion & unadulterated quality of the original in doing so. Packing in just as much fun, madness & awesomeness as the first film, exquisitely steered under Yuh's direction, and marking another creative high for DreamWorks Animation, Kung Fu Panda 2 is another triumph of its genre that's highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying from the first frame to the last. Definitely recommended.",,Anonymous,Animation
Wrong Video/Broken Kung Fu Panda 2 File,"It seems that the video labeled Kung Fu Panda 2 on BoxMovies is actually playing Mission Impossible instead. This could be due to an error in file labeling or uploading on the platform. The movie files might have been mixed up, so when you select Kung Fu Panda 2, it mistakenly loads Mission Impossible instead. This could be a technical issue or a mistake made during the content update. You might want to report it to the platform's support team so they can correct the video file.

An Irresistible Action Comedy Adventure,"One of our KIDS FIRST! youth film critics reviewed this, 14-year-old Gabriella Chu from New York. She loved it and thought that kids, ages 8 and up would as well. View her videotaped review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZmOZ4FaCY4Or read her written review: The Kung Fu Panda is back with more adventure! This movie is an irresistible action comedy that's pure fun. In case you have not watched the first Kung Fu Panda before, the protagonist Po, is a panda who transforms from noodle shop employee to kung fu master joining the Furious Seven (a group of heroes who fight villains.) In this sequel, Po finds himself conflicted with his past. He starts to question where he has come from, and why his father is a goose instead of the panda. He also has to defeat evil Lord Shen, a peacock who plans to use a secret weapon to conquer China and destroy kung fu. Will Po be able to defeat Lord Shen even when conflicted with this past? You will have to watch this movie for yourself!Watching this movie in 3D felt so life-like, especially the action scenes. There are so many action sequences and they all are very intense. My favorite sequence is the one where Po finds his inner peace because the movie is in slow motion and incorporates scenes of his past as well as scenes from Master Shifu's technique of inner peace. The slow motion emphasized Po's technique, and made the scene much more interesting. I also thought the humorous voice of Po, Jack Black, is perfect for his role as a lively and entertaining panda. The movie also has inspiring messages such as: look to the future instead of the past, and discover who you are. However, I did not think this movie was as good as the first one. I did not find the story as touching and upbeat. I also didn't find the voices of the characters recognizable, except for Po and the Tigress's voice. In addition, the colors of the movie were not very vibrant. They did not fit the comical mood of the movie so much.Overall though, I think this is a great animated family comedy. I would recommend it to children ages 8 and up because younger kids might not be able to follow the storyline. You should definitely go see this if you are into adventure!Reviewed by Gabriella Chu, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic",,Anonymous,Animation
Mark your calendars: Coming May 2014 Kung Fu Panda 3,"I went in knowing that the first KFP could not be topped. The newness of the concept, the opening fantasy sequence, the Tai Lung escape scene, the clumsy humor of Po, I could go on...no beating it or duplicating it. The sequel doesn't beat it. But it's still very good. And for very different reasons from those that made the original was so awesome. In KFP2 the Furious Five have grown, moved on. They've improved their kung fu. They work as a unit, with a new leader, Po the Dragon Warrior, whom they've fully accepted. The banter between the team is raised to a new level. The rocky relationship between Tigress and Po is replaced by friendship. The action scenes where they're all fighting together are...something not seen in the first movie, actually. The story is excellent, centering on Po's search for his real parents. It's a little bit more intense than the first, with a lot more weapons used than last time. It's just more of an action movie. There were a lot of kids there when I saw it(ages 6-12 I'd guess) and I heard a lot of comments during and after the movie. Universal approval. There will be another in this series. Hopefully we'll see more of Shifu, who only shows up at the beginning and end of '2.'",,Anonymous,Animation
Po and Co Return To Save Kung Fu,"Jennifer Yuh's sequel is just as charming and funny as the first one. It does feel a bit too 'American' but fun nonetheless. Po returns with his gang, this time to rescue Kung Fu. However, in his quest, he is confronted by a secret from his past. Most of the splendid characters from the first movie, including Shifu (voiced superbly by Dustin Hoffman), are back. The lively characters are given hilarious lines (with adult humour) which certainly makes this entertaining for adults and children.The animation is quite detailed and colourful. The motions still give away the 'CGI-ness' but that doesn't stand in the way of enjoying it. The handdrawn flashback sequences were great. The story is stronger and deeper than in the first film and it does echo a lot of historical events such as the fading away of Kung Fu after the introduction of weapons (such as guns and cannons). It is also darker than its prequel as themes of revenge, war, death and forgiveness are developed into the story but at the same time, 'Kung Fu Panda 2' manages to stay suitable enough for children. Moreover, there are some cool action sequences that are amusing to watch.But, I still haven't figured out how they managed to chain Viper. Overall, 'Kung Fu Panda 2' is an exception to the statement that sequels don't live up to the first film. 'Am curious about how the third movie will go as near the end, there's an indicator. I just hope the makers keep up with the brilliance of its predecessors.",,Anonymous,Animation
Visually stunning!,"Oh, it's so on. After a less than spectacular beginning to animation and still having the occasional misstep, Dreamworks has put themselves in direct competition with Pixar. While Fox Animation Studios continues to be unsuccessful in their attempts, and with Blue Sky Studios being even worse (they insist on hanging onto the irksome Ice Age franchise), Dreamworks animation has put itself on pace to being nearly as good as Pixar.Kung Fu Panda 2 is just the latest in a string of great movies from this production studio. With Jack Black leading the cast as Po, the Kung Fu Panda, it was going to be, at the very least, entertaining. It's also proof that a writing ""team,"" as it were, can do a great job. Most cartoons do this with great success. Primary writers Aibel and Berger are also responsible for the Alvin And The Chipmunks stories, so perhaps it's even better they have consultants in the matter.The character development was top notch. They could have chosen, as plenty do, to keep things status quo, but instead, we area treated to a progression of the characters, and even a look at things to come, should there be another sequel. The characters were likable, as in the first. It allowed for an attachment, and therefore an investment in them, particularly Po, his father, and Master Shifu. They also did a good job in making the villain, Lord Shen, loathsome.Jack Black had much to do with the success of Po. His Shtick can become tiresome in live action movies, but in Kung Fu Panda 2 he brings Po to life. He gives Po a connection with the audience that few main characters in movies do.The rest of the cast is magnificent as well. Dustin Hoffman didn't have the same screen-time as in the first, but he has a good voice that puts Master Shifu in the spotlight when he's on screen. David Cross and Seth Rogen and also have talent voicing characters. Gary Oldman lends his villainy voice. He is rapidly gaining experience in voicing, now even doing video games.Director Jennifer Yuh has nearly 2 decades of animation experience in everything from TV to feature films. Her work in Kung Fu Panda 2 is meritorious. She worked on Kung Fu Panda as well, winning awards for storyboarding. I'm not sure how involved Guillermo Del Toro was, but I'd bet he had at least a small amount of input.I don't watch 3-D movies much anymore, but the 3-D in Kung Fu Panda 2 is supposed to be the best so far. Either way, it's a superb movie and a sequel that can arguable be better than the first.Visually stunning in 3D, strong cast and a good story about Po finding his true identity. More action than the previous one.",,Anonymous,Animation
for kids and adults,"I took the kids to Kung Fu Panda 2 during the holidays and they loved it. We are not fans of 3D but I would have to say the water droplets looked amazing! the kids loved the storyline and both of them found it easy to follow and funny (one is 5, and the other is 9). Both of them came out of the movie and raved, and surprisingly i found it (almost) as enjoyable as they did!Quote of the movie would have to be from Mantis; ""I never had daddy issues but thats probably because mum ate his head off before I was born""...Well I thought it was funny!!Maree - Penrith professionals",,Anonymous,Animation
