A two-sided piece of art,"This film isn't for all people. That's to say about a lot of movies in general of course, but this one in particular brings up a big clashing point between critics; What do we want to see in our movies? What is more important, to portray a fictional setting for the sake of giving people a mind blowing visual experience or to amuse and amaze them with clever plot twists and intelligent dialogs?First lets analyze what exactly this film is made of. Basically, the whole thing is just one epic fighting scene after another. Most noticeably is the camera work and the visual effects. Every shot seems like it was intended to be a work of art. The colors, the characters, the costumes, the backgrounds... every little detail has been given so much attention. During the big fights you'll also instantly notice the unique editing. There are a lot of ""time slowdowns"" throughout the battles which show what exactly is happening. Fatal wounds that slowly leak blood spatters in the air, decapitated heads traveling in slow-motion across the screen... it's all there.The story on the other hand isn't very complicated, in the sense that the whole movie could probably be described in a sentence or two. The dialogs are simple and most often talk about moral values like freedom and honor. If you would look at the script, it would probably look like another movie that has nothing more to offer then idealistic visions of how life should be.Reviewers of this title seem to be split up in two groups. They either love it with passion calling it an epic movie of the 21th century, or hate it even more and throw it off like a piece of garbage consisting of mindless action and silly clich√© phrases. I feel reluctant to take a position in this argument. Normally it's tolerable to weigh out both sides of this matter to result in a fair judgment about a movie. Not in this one. On the one hand the visual are surely among the best to be witnessed in a movie. Every detail, every background, every special effect set to the scenes are so mindblowingly stunning. On the other hand the plot and dialogs are of the most simplistic and quite frankly dumb kind. ""I fight for freedom! I'd rather die in honor then live in shame!"" Sounds familiar?Of course it could be debated that this movie was never intended in the first place to have a unique plot that makes your head spin. But from an objective point of view it's still lacking in this department, so it should be noted.Now that's fine and all, but does that all make of the film? Is it worth watching or what? I think it is. For me the good outweighs the bad by miles. From the second the movie started it grabbed me and didn't let go. Every battle, every scene of the movie had me at the tip of my chair. Everything from the strong acting to the wondrous visuals to the war-shouts of the soldiers was just so stunning... it was truly a wonderful experience.I did not one single moment felt like the movie lacked anything. But I could imagine why other people did.So here's the deal.If you are easily impressed by beautiful landscapes, wonderful camera-work and editing and powerful acting then go see this. Right. Now. You'll be missing out if you don't. There is so much to see, so much power in the way this comic is translated to the big screen... It'll leave you in awe.However, you are looking for a good story, clever plot twists, some innovating to the world of the movies then skip this. 300 contains nothing of this, nor does it wants to give you this.I enjoyed this movie so much, but I know there will be people that will pass of as rubbish, and that's understandable. Just be sure to make up your mind about what you want to see when you go to the theater yourself instead of being drawn into bias by the tons of reviews this site has to offer.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"Forget the Naysayers, 300 Delivers!","300(2007)Review: 300 has been given lots of criticism. People like to view in the political way. That is not the way. Here's my take.300 is an entertaining movie. This is all about the action and it's Spartans. The movie takes about the first 30 minutes to give us plot development before the Spartans take it to the battlefield.The action is the key. The slow motion action is what really delivers. This is like a ballet of blood done so nicely. The action needless to say is satisfying. We are given lots of campy dialog and some good humor here and there that works. Gerard Butler is wonderful. He embodies the great king. Becomes him.Now, on to the politics, 300 has it's own politics, but it was also based on a comic book written back in 1998. How can this be a pro-Bush statement? This is just like another Frank Miller picture, Sin City. The point is to make the comic book come to life. 300 was written by Frank Miller almost a decade ago and you think this is right-wing propaganda?Listen to me. Take a deep breath and lighten up. Okay?One last thing, this movie is NOT a history lesson. This is based on a graphic novel, similar to a movie made back in 1962, and is inspired by the battle in 480 B.C. This is not racist either.The Last Word: 300 delivers what is was sent out to do. Action. Entertainment. Skin. Ignore the naysayers and enjoy. Excellent popcorn fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
A great movie!,"It seems that everyone who hated this movie must have written a review, so I thought I'd throw in my two cents to even things up a bit. First, if you assume every movie is made simply to uppercut some sort of ideology into the audience's chest, then yes, it does seem very racist, xenophobic, and the like. However, this film is based on a freakin' comic book! The Spartans were some of the most skilled, nastiest, nationalistic fighters out there, and certainly had reason to be more driven and nationalistic than Persia's, which was not an army of individuals fighting for their land and families. Should they have been portrayed differently simply to satisfy the current political climate? Are you mad? The cheesy one-liners are also evidence that this movie IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK. The exaggerated characters is further evidence that this movie IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK. This is not a historical movie, it is a movie which seeks to put a rockstar, no-holds-barred spin on a particular historical event. It isn't attempting to be accurate, or balanced, or anything of the sort, and it SHOULDN'T, because that isn't it's purpose. It shouldn't be obligated to do anything of the sort. It's ENTERTAINMENT. Nothing more. And it's damn good entertainment, in my opinion.Every scene is beautifully crafted. I found the slowdown to be stylistic and much of the dialogue, which is apparently cheesy and fascist to everyone else, to be at least somewhat inspiring, and certainly engaging. These Spartans were trained their entire lives to be warriors, their entire culture is built around success in battle, and you don't expect them to be quite skilled, much more so than a slave army, and quite patriotic? Also, this movie was from the point of view of the Spartans. How would this army have appeared to the Spartans? Wouldn't their stories now be over-exaggerated, over-simplified, almost legendary? There isn't a great amount of character development because this movie is about a battle, ONE battle, THE battle for the continuance of the Western world, and yes, IF the Spartans had been simply overwhelmed from the start, and if their Athenian allies hadn't completely CRUSHED the much larger Persian navy at sea, the West simply could not have existed in any similar manner as it has. And yes, the Western world is guilty of arrogance, overextending it's boundaries to the point of imperialism, however, it has given our world a plethora of all-too-important philosophical ideals that are simply irreplaceable if we want to live in a free society.I realize I spent a great deal of my time being critical of other reviews, so I would like to take the time to apologize for perhaps wasting the time of someone who was simply searching for a detailed point of view on the film. I can assure you that the film is action-packed. The scenes are absolutely beautiful, every one of them. The film is gory, but artistically gory, if that makes any sense. You'll know what I mean. The story is simple, direct, and inspiring. The acting is excellent. The movie, overall, was a tremendous experience. I give it a 9.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Chills!,"After I saw the teaser for 300 I knew I HAD to see this movie! From then on I avoided all other previews, reviews, etc. as not to influence my expectations of the movie. I then went into the theater on opening night with no knowledge of the plot... only that it had something to do with Greeks and Frank Miller! Ignorance is bliss! I was absolutely blown away. I'm a 26 yr old female who generally doesn't watch violent films... but I found the battle scenes so well done and breath taking. I had chills and goosebumps virtually the entire film. I'm with many other reviewers, who felt like they had to contain themselves from shouting ""yeah!"" at times. Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought the whole movie was very sexy and passionate, whether it was the sex scene, a battle scene, or Leonidis addressing his men.I think it is a shame that so many people are condemning this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, or it's ""racism"", etc. People are reading far too into this movie. Whatever happened to enjoying a movie simply because it is entertaining and pleasing to to the eye? Don't people watch movies anymore to escape from the daily grind of life? I know I'm not as well spoken as many who have posted here. I just think this was a fantastic movie. I didn't go see it to learn anything! I just wanted to be entertained! And boy was I!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
The Evolution of Epic Battles,"After gaving us some of the greatest epic movies in the last 50 years,it was clear that filmmakers needed to take them to the next level.But how can you make a new movie,for the audience to like,without recycling old material?Answer:You improve what old filmmakers couldn't:Graphics.Ben Hur,Braveheart,Gladiator,Spartacus and perhaps even Troy are only some of the epic movies that gave the audience so big thrills that they cannot be repeated. Almost every epic movie that will be made today,no matter how good the story will be or how faithful will be to reality,is bound to repeat itself.We got examples from Alexander and Kingdom of Heaven.300 doesn't apply to this category.Besides it takes the epic to the next level.And more are like to follow.Just like in the Lord of the Rings,much CGI was used here.The result? This movie was a pleasure for the eye.All the camera work and graphics exceeded my expectations. I thought they were comparable,if not better,to the LOTR,go see for yourselves.I could write something about the plot or the actors's outstanding performances(especially Gerard Butler's..you see,being Greek-Italian,I wanted the best from the actors..Butler gave it. The anger in his eyes,the fury in his voice and the violence in his actions really reminded an ancient Greek king),but I won't ruin it for you. You must see it to understand how great this movie is.But always remember that this is a movie that is based on a graphic novel and is by no means a faithful depiction of what really happened in Thermopylae in 480 B.C. All those who will pay the ticket to see this movie,must be prepared not for a historic movie,but for a stylish battle movie.This movie,together with the LOTR,is the entrance to the 21st century's new epic movies.Kudos to Zack Snyder,who came from nowhere and has,already from Dawn of the Dead,proved that he is a brilliant and capable director. We will surely see more of him in the upcoming years.So,you read my Comment?Aren't you curious?What are you waiting for?Run to the nearest cinema,see this piece of art and when you are finished don't forget to come to IMDb to vote. This movie is destined to be at least in the top 100.C'mon people!Hail for 300,the Evolution of Epic Battles!",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"Awesome, breath-taking film.","I somehow missed the hype on this one, and the trailer really didn't excite me, but I got a chance to see an advance screening and the other reviewer here who said ""It blew me away"" hit the nail right on the head.I generally hate going to the cinema - preferring to wait until the DVD or HD-DVD are available because I'm fed up of shoddy prints, poor sound systems, ignorant members of the public with their ringing phones, late arrivals, noisy popcorn etc. My home system is so much better. But not for this movie! It needs to be seen on the big screen (preferably an Imax - I'm hoping to catch it a second time on IMAX) with a good sound system. The images are consistently breath-taking, the sound is staggeringly good and note-perfect throughout, and Gerard Butler is barely recognisable as the guy from ""Dear Frankie"" (a great, under-rated movie) and ""Phantom of the Opera"".Highly recommended. I've given it a 9, and I don't think I've given a movie that high a score for over a year (and I average about 6 movies a week). This makes ""Gladiator"" look like a cheap kid's cartoon.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Beautifully crafted film but just too ""hollywood""...","Yes, I know the fan boys (which I consider myself a member) will howl but I thought this film fell far short of what it could have been.What I loved: Cinematography, fx, camera direction was incredible. This film was lovingly crafted and shot. I felt like I was not watching the actual battle but living someone's dream they had while listening to the narrator tell of these exploits. What I thought was very average: The dialog was groaningly bad at times but since it was comic book (excuuuuuuse me, graphic novel, ahem) dialog I could get around it. The ninja-like Persian Immortals were cheesy but I could understand since they were supposed to be from the east and this is a soldier's point of view we are hearing. What I thought was awful: David Wenham as Dilios (the narrator) was awful when on screen although not so bad when narrating, he used the ""I'm a tough guy raspy voice"" and just sounded like a skinny Australian using a tough guy raspy voice.The historic inaccuracies are legion; Leonides tells his son the strength of the Spartans was the phalanx and then they spent all of 10 minutes actually using the tactic. The one edged swords were a Hollywood contrivance and the Spartans going into battle without their bronze cuirass' would just not have happened (and if a soldier was telling the story to an army he would have expounded on how the superior armor and technology made the Spartan's invincible but for being outnumbered 1000s to 1) Also the roughness of the workmanship of the helms and shields would not have been accepted in the militant society that Sparta was.But by far the craziest and most grievous error was Leonides expounding on a ""free Greece"" and how all men should be free. The Spartans were some of the most vicious slavers in the history of man; they literally kept thousands of slaves! They used their slaves as assassination practice targets for their young soldiers among other practices. This is like making a movie about the American Civil War, having no black people in the plantation scenes and then Robert E Lee standing up and giving an abolitionist speech at Appomattox. This glossing over of history was just a terrible disservice to the thousands of innocent human beings who were killed and oppressed by the Spartans.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Stupendous movie making!!  A masterpiece!!!,"'300' is a totally riveting masterpiece of film making. Zack Snyder, inspired by the graphic novel, has brought a 2487 year-old news story to life with people you really care about who are faced with choices between compromise and war that are all too familiar today.The breath-taking CGI images are flawlessly integrated with the live action. All the actors are excellent in their roles, and Butler IS Leonidas.The sound design is excellent. The score was recorded by the London Phil with a full chorus and is beautiful to listen to, but is very reminiscent of 'Gladiator' which detracts from the otherwise total originality of the film.This movie integrates the potentials of film-making and story-telling in a wonderful new way that is the best of both entertainment and artistic achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
meh,"It's almost as if the writer and director made a challenge to themselves to see how many clich√©s they could fit in and scenes and plot devices they could carbon copy from braveheart, hero, lord of the rings, the patriot, gladiator, mortal combat and god knows how many other epic movies. It also loses points for including lines like ""freedom isn't free"" and having too many comparisons to the war on terror (with a pro war message).The characters show one-dimensionality that is usually reserved for romantic comedies. The good guys are white. the bad guys are brown. Holocaust deniers have a better grip on historic events. It is a shoe in if the Oscars ever add the category ""most homoerotic"".stylistically though, it was the bomb-digga.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Standing ovation at the Berlinale Film Festival,"I was one of the 1700 lucky viewers to get a ticket to the world premiere of 300. Zack Snyder has done a great job adapting the work of Frank Miller to the movie format! I've never experienced a screening that had to be interrupted because of spontaneous applause by the crowd! The special effects are quite good. The colors are hard to describe. Don't expect the b/w colored style as in Sin City. The colors are soft / Grey / well antique. As a viewer you have the impression of being in the middle of the battles. Well it's maybe not a truthful interpretation of the historical facts, and the same applies to the interpretation of Frank Millers novel. But the story worked for me. Lena Headey (as Queen Gorgo) was in my opinion the best actor/actress in this movie, she really fits 100%.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Always catching the coat-tails of...,"...Wonderful productions, I wonder how much I've been influenced by exposure to the various thumbs of armchair critics. However, there can be little influence from naysayers about this film because I am a true fan of the sword and sandal classics.In retrospect, one wouldn't be surprised that the entire film was shot on green-screen sets, but it was so masterfully (or at least distractedly) done that you don't think about the dramatic skies and wheat fields as piped in. In fact, the entire cg aspect was transparent, which even the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings series had not managed to do completely.The stylization of the effects, such as the radiant glow, deepened shadows, and slow motion sequences, seemed to emphasize the movie's illustrated roots, and though sometimes I found myself wishing I could see clearer, I always found deep satisfaction and immersion in the storyline. I think without the effects the plot would have required more elaboration, and turning a piece of art into another 'Gladiator' look-alike.This movie is going on my keeper list, as I found it very comforting to watch, inspiring, and I will never tire of looking at (finally) scantily clad men, especially Gerard. The kingly figure of Leonidas, cloaked in red as is his Spartiate warriors, reminds me of the warrior class and king from George Nader's sci-fi book 'Chrome'. Romantically idealized, the simplistic portrayal of virtue and honor are purely portrayed by a directly stylized hero.Of course, the villain was just as idealized, and therein is the complaint. Nobody likes a baddie without explanation, and perhaps the studio thought that being a Persian god was explanation enough. I would have enjoyed a much more developed Xerxes, but Ru Paul did a great job on the part. Just kidding. Rodrigo Santoro was superb, as big and evil as the comic portrays, and he does a good job overwhelming the much smaller king of Spartans.The acting was good, and the script solid enough, all in all earning a rating of an 8, but as promised, tanned and bearded men with valor earns it a 10. We need more movies like this.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"Visceral, violent and visually stunning to the point where the lack of much else doesn't really matter","In the year 480 BC, King Xerxes of Persia set in motion his enormous slave empire to crush the small group of independent Greek states ¬ñ the only stronghold of freedom still remaining in the then known world. As the countless armies of Xerxes approaches, King Leonidas petitions the ruling council to meet the army with whatever men can be found. With the council unwilling to release soldiers until after the religious festival, Leonidas sets out with his 300 strong personal army to meet Xerxes' men at a narrow pass knowing they must hold off the approach for as long as they can until the army arrives¬ñ even if it means their deaths.Although I am surprised to see this film so highly rated on IMDb, I can understand why it is so because it does deliver a powerful experience, almost powerful enough to carry it through its lack of real depth or substance. You can see the selling point on the DVD cover or the poster because it is in these places where any film visually has to sell itself. With 300 though this selling continues across the entire film because, holding close to the graphic novel roots, the visual design is the all here. The plot is simple and, although there is a little bit of politicing back home, the film is all about the stand of the 300 against countless others. In this regard it is visceral, violent and visually stunning. The mix of effects with live action brings the action to live and is as suitably overblown as the legend.Snyder's direction matches the effects and he wallows in every macho swing of the sword, doing really well to capture the action in a way that is engaging and clear. The lack of substance was a bit of a problem but to be honest the film does sweep you along in the moment of the battle and mostly this is all you care about. The cast don't really have characters so much as presence and mostly they deliver in this area. Butler is strong in the lead and he convinces in the role of Leonidas. Headley and West have the harder job back home to provide some interest in the politics behind the battle ¬ñ they do well enough (particularly The Wire's West, but I'm biased) but the script does rather leave them to their own devices. The rest of the cast are appropriately muscular and heroic and fit in with what the script is trying to do.Overall this is an effective but superficial film. The design and the look is the all but fortunately it delivers in this regard really well. The performances, the script and everything else falls into line in supporting the graphic novel feel of the film and, although I would like to say I favour substance over style, it is hard not to like when the style is this well done.",,Anonymous,Action
"Intensity, flair and passion. This is film is a beast.","The best way 300 can be described in a single sentence is 'The Lord of The Rings' filmed in the style of 'The Matrix.' It is a fantasy of epic proportions.Reading some of the comments other users have left, many cite the film as being ""pretentious"", ""offensive"" and ""badly directed"", though I believe these people are wildly mislead.The direction of the film is fantastic, capturing every essence of the brutally artistic vision of Frank Miller's comic. The fight scenes in particular are simply brilliant, full of adrenaline and beautifully filmed.The cast, with a refreshing absence of Americans features not a single poor performance. Gerard Butler, the protagonist, has a particularly strong performance, belting out some quite fantastic one-liners, ""We're in for one wild night."" Some criticise the film for its portrayal of the Persians and the beasts used thereof, such as a Rhino and an Elephant, neither of which look anything like the real thing. What one has to remember is this film is seen through the eyes of the Spartans and not having seen these animals before, would have been incredibly frightening, the same with the representation of the Persians. Call it artistic license. And as for historical accuracy, this film does not even pretend to be so, this can be testified for by the lack of real information by the narrator. It is after all based on a comic-book.Overall this film is easily one of the best fantasy epics of the last decade, if not THE best. It is difficult to fault to be honest, but I do feel that there is not enough background about some of the other more prominent of the 300, but that hardly detracts from the overall sheer brilliance of the film.Absolute brilliance - 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"visually elegant, but reads like a memo from the pentagon","I, personally, love the story of the 300 Spartans, it's really hard not to, so I was biased from the start. On one hand I want to point out the historical discrepancies and reference books and other films, you know: what they could have done better, changed, where they didn't need to fudge on history. But its unreasonable to judge a film about comic book visuals and video game violence based upon its historical relevance. That said it's not a bad movie. You get what you're looking for, amazing visuals, great landscapes, endless battles, homoeroticism, cheesy one-liners in the tradition of Die Hard. (I thought maybe they used up all the one-liners in the trailer, but was I wrong, there is a whole cache of them lined up for the audience.)If all you're searching for is an engaging, mind numbing, gore filled two hours, this will surely do the trick. But if you're a sucker for a good story or solid acting you find this film a bit disappointing. The story of the 300 Spartans is spruced up a bit to be slightly more relevant for the modern, post 9/11 American audience. There are lots of politically induced soliloquies about freedom not being free and dying for your country. (Not that I'm attempting to pan the basic ideal here, that's another discussion entirely, but I think I might have heard these lines somewhere before¬Ö) There is also an overwhelming sense of the propagation of the east/west binary. The east, obviously being the Persian army, is portrayed as enslaving barbarians, exotic, an object of observation and curiosity, to be pondered but not participated in. This is a point of historical departure that feels phony and deliberate. Truly at this point in time there is a sort of binary, but the Spartans are portrayed with American values and the Persians with no values but the hope of becoming gods in their own right. A concept that really has no place being perpetuated at any time. I'm not saying don't see this, or trying to condone censorship, but merely pointing out that this is a symptom of America's post 9/11 terror hysteria. The film is fun, and incredibly well shot. But the plot is problematic, at best, and is the kind fake ""independent"" film that Hollywood is beginning to churn out at a rapid pace to consume the growing video game/comic book demographic of film-goers that Tarantino has bred to believe that good films contain breasts and unrealistic amounts of blood. (not that it's always bad, I still love Oldboy and there is nothing there but senseless, gratuitous violence, it's just poorly done in 300)",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Despite Several Flaws A Very Memorable Movie,"Hearing that 300 is based upon a "" graphic novel "" which is a pseudo intellectual phrase used to describe a comic book I didn't go out of my way to watch this because the present Hollywood movie making factory spends too much time and money bringing these type of stories to the screen . Also I was very unimpressed with director Zack Snyder's previous film the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD which is a pale imitation of a superior movie . Sometimes prejudice can get in the way of judging a film of its own merits because 300 is one of the more memorable movie moments from last year and one that seems unforgivably ignored at the more prestigious film award ceremoniesBeing based upon a comic book you could say in all honesty that the visuals mirror those of a graphic novel , but I would claim it goes far , far beyond that and say it's like watching a painting come to life . The battle scenes are entirely different from those seen in LORD OF THE RINGS or KINGDOM OF HEAVEN but are no less impressive and some of the battle sequences , most notably the ones featuring the immortals are terrifying . Did I say this film is like a painting come to life ? In some sequences it looks like a nightmare come to life and this stylish formalist type of cinema will send a chill down your spine . This is cinema strictly for adults onlyFans of ancient history and classical studies will find a lot to criticise because it's not an accurate depiction of ancient Greece but you should always make the legend according to John Ford . Unfortunately by concentrating on the visuals there's other aspects lacking . The Spartans don't really come across as real characters from ancient times , more of a crowd of wise cracking macho cyphers and let's be honest here , with the exception of voice over the dialogue is rather poor . It often reminded me of something present day Scottish folk hero John Smeaton might say : "" Dinnae come tae Sparta , we'll set aboot ya up here ""But despite these very noticeable flaws this is a truly memorable movie down to the jaw dropping visuals and it's the visuals the film will be rightly remembered for . It's a pity that the Oscar voters have ignored 300 because certainly make up , cinematography , editing and possibly best supporting actor for Andrew Tiernan as Ephialtes should have been nominated at least and this film will be highly regarded in years to come",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Somewhat entertaining folkloric celebration of the ongoing war against tyranny featuring animated Greek statues,"The 300 is an entertaining CGI and live action bloodbath with a lot of good messages which are, unfortunately couched in an endless stream of clich√©s. The script is, however, its weakest point, and is actually somewhat superfluous.What you will take away from this film is really up to you. If you choose to be offended by ancient Spartan morality because it runs against your contemporary concerns, that's your choice. If you choose to see this as patriotic or nationalistic glorification of the military and organized, sanctioned murder - well perhaps that says more about you than it does about this film. If you choose to see it as an example of the potential of people who believe in themselves and in the value of their own lives because of a sense of freedom or a delusion of freedom, is, again, your choice. If you believe that bringing up embarrassing moments in a culture's heritage or telling a story from only one side (i.e. the side we know about) is unfair, well, then you should avoid history and stick with fantasy.Interpret as you wish - the basics of this story - including the motives of Leonides and others - are true to the history that has been passed down. It should be no surprise that racism, nationalism, homophobia and other unfortunate and irrational cultural notions have a deep lineage in human heritage. To argue that films should not attempt to depict these things would be to deny their existence - and would do nothing to fight against them.The 300 recounts a piece of ancient Greek history, as retold (and greatly embellished) by thousands of generations of Europeans - most recently Frank Miller in a graphic novel. I do not wish to take anything away from this story. It really is a great one. Three hundred Spartans and Arcadians really did take on several hundred thousand Persians from Xerxes armies in 480 BC at Thermopylae. And they really did scare the hell out of the Persians. Of course, most of the details depicted in this version of the story (and there have been many films about this battle before),are made up.The film succeeds in making visible the main points - both metaphorical and philosophical, that must be taken away from the mythic story of the defense of Thermopylae. The Spartan level of defiance, commitment to the value of their lives over and above their lives themselves, Greek views of Xerxes and the Persians (source of much folklore) and the tremendous debt Sparta accrued from the rest of Greece.The excellent visuals - which include exaggerated deformities, African animals trussed up to appear as demonic monsters, and a variety of other bent truths - really bring home the mythic quality of the story (this is incidentally characteristic of Miller's art as well),and well suggest how many of the Greeks actually viewed the wonders of Xerxes vast host.The acting is good for what it is - a simple, very violent and graphic tale. The directing is OK, but the detailed, beautifully choreographed fight scenes (which take up about half of the screen time) use the same mixture of greatly detailed slow motion cuts and fast-paced close-in chaos that has become a Hollywood war film clich√© in recent times. Although I have criticized the script as the worst element of this film, speaking is really only important in about 15 total minutes within the film. It is worth listening to every scene with Xerxes in it, the conversations between Leonides and Laerthes and Leonides and his captain, and Gorgo's speech in the senate chamber. Otherwise, the soundscape is mostly worthwhile only for the audio components of the battle. The musical component of the soundtrack is mostly good, but occasionally utilizes an inappropriate and frankly silly hard rock instrumentation.Bottom line - if you enjoy action films featuring graphic violence and a lot of ripped guys dancing with swords, spears and shields, this is the film for you. If you want to get a general sense of the battle of Thermopylae, this is a good choice (however, don't think of it as a substitute for reading you textbook on ancient Greece).

Thrilling blood-fest,"The 480 BC Battle of Thermopylae is the stuff of military legend when, in popular lore, a mere 300 Spartans commanded by King Leonidas held off a Persian force led by Xerxes the Great that Herodotus claimed as 2.6 million. In truth, the Spartans were backed by a mixed force of almost 7,000, while there are enormous variations in modern estimates of the multi-ethnic Persian army, but somewhere between 100,000-200,000 seems realistic. Whatever the actual figures, the odds against the Spartans were terrible, death was inevitable, and their honour secure.The story was first told on film in 1962 when director Rudolph Mat√© went to Greece and shot a worthy, but conventional and surprisingly leaden, version entitled ""The 300 Spartans"", starring American Richard Egan as King Leonidas and the British David Farrar as Xerxes. ""300"" takes the same basic narrative and presents it in an utterly different style in a blood-fest when ""The Wild Bunch"" meets ""Kill Bill"" and the visuals are like nothing except ""Sin City"". This time the director is Zack Snyder, known for his music videos, and the location is a studio set in Montreal with green backgrounds later filled by superb computer-generated graphics and the whole storybook style is based on the graphic novel by co-producer Frank Miller. Both versions use the legendary exchange: ""When we attack today, our arrows will blot out the sun!"" ""Good; then we will fight in the shade."" But only ""300"" has such fun lines as: ""Spartans! Enjoy your breakfast, for tonight we dine in Hell!""Ever since its first public showing at the Berlin Film Festival, most critics have mauled ""300"" and it presents an easy target for those wanting something more cerebral: there is virtually no plot or characterisation, the script is sparse and bland, much of the acting is exaggerated and over-loud, when it is not homo-erotic it is oddly camp, and the whole thing is stereotypical when it is not outright xenophobic and politically incorrect. And yet, as entertainment, it has much to offer: the sepia-tinged visuals are absolutely stunning and the fight sequences viscerally exciting. I was fortunate enough to see it in IMAX and I regularly felt blood-splattered and exhausted and quite ready to leap into the action.There are no big names in the cast list which helps the sense of history but does not raise the thespian talent quotient. Gerard Butler plays King Leonidas with a Scottish accent, while the Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro is a version of Xerxes bejewelled with ethnic metalwork. Most of the warriors are literally larger than life: the actors playing the Spartans reveal most of their bodies with digitally-enhanced muscles, while on Xerxes' side characters include a huge hunchback, a giant emissary and a claw-armed executioner as well the metal-masked Immortals. This is before we get on to an enormous raging rhino and bedecked elephants. Truly this is a battle with a circus-like cast. The love interest comes from the feisty wife of Leonidas, Queen Gorgo, portrayed by the alluring British actress Lena Headey. There is even a scene in a rippling corn field borrowed from ""Gladiator"".At the end of the day, what makes the movie are the thrilling fight sequences with encounters in which the film is slowed down and then speeded up to give a video-game quality that is unlike anything you have previously seen on the big screen. Whem a sword slashes or a spear lungs or an arrow whistles, you really feel and hear it. At times, it is as if a picture by Hieronymus Bosch had come to life.",,Anonymous,Action
"If they made 300 so everyone would like it, I wouldn't love it like i do.","If you love romantic comedies, and Broadway musicals you will hate this movie. If you're prone to imagining homosexuality everywhere, this movie will worsen your condition. If you hold 2,500 year old grudges, also..not likey. I'm also glad you will hate this movie because I probably hate what you like, and if they made this movie so you would like it too, I wouldn't love 300 as much as i do. If you love movies that take you to a world filled with fantasy and unbelievable action you will put this in your top movie list as soon as you see it. The plot is simple but it's also one of the oldest and most compelling events in Western civilization, and yes, it did save the world for reason, logic and freedom of thought which sadly, are being abandoned today. Leonidas is a real hero, exaggerated perfectly as all historic and religious events always are. I cheer Gerard Butler's Leonidas but I'm also cheering the real Leonidas and the 300. This lends a significance to the movie that most other films can't claim. The dialogue is simple-often paraphrasing of actual comments made almost 2500 years ago, come on, do we really need or want English literature here? This movie is SPARTAN in its SIMPLICITY, like great minimalist art. All art forms evolve by incorporating or blending other mediums. Zach Snyder and Frank Miller have most successfully melded two of my favorite mediums, comic books/illustration and film. This film is an evolution in the notion of what a film can be-an illustrators vision made 3-D and contained in a 2 hour time-span. With a compelling and historically relevant story to boot! Simply amazing. An evolution in art.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Brutal and Spectacular!,"I have to say that this for me has so far been the biggest shock movie of the year, after seeing the trailer to 300, it looked like such a pathetic excuse for computer animation. But my friends wanted to see it tonite and I figured why not? I couldn't believe my eyes and how excellent this movie was, I mean, visually it was actually stunning as well as the battle sequences were beyond crazy! So far, I would say that 300 is the best movie I have seen in the theater so far this year. It was so exciting to watch, every scene had one shock after the other and the battle sequences were so amazing to see, how the Spartans defended themselves, they were absolutely awesome!It's based on the Spartans, their lives and how they came to be what the legend that they are to this day. When they are threatened by the Persians that they will be turned into slaves, the Spartans decide to defend themselves along side with their king. Going against incredible odds of only 300 Spartans to thousands and thousands of Persians and horrible monsters, they pull together and become the strongest team of all! But the Persian ""lord"" will not give up until he claims victory over the team that is beating them down like they're nothing.It had great dark drama around a light humor that would give you a breathe of fresh air. The scene with the king looking up to see all the arrows coming towards him is one of the most amazing and unique scenes I have ever seen in cinema. I would Definitely recommend this movie for anyone to see, it is an incredible movie with intense battle sequences, terrific acting, beautiful settings, and a great story. I guarantee you will not be let down.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Action
If the rating keeps on going like this then i think 300 would take over GODFATHER in the top 250 list,"This movie is really amazing guys and do believe me. i am sure this would be in the top 250 list as no 1. In the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC an alliance of Greek city-states fought the invading Persian army in the mountain pass of Thermopylae. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Persian King Xerxes lead a Army of well over 100,000 (Persian king Xerxes before war has about 170,000 army) men to Greece and was confronted by 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians and other Slave soldiers. Xerxes waited for 10 days for King Leonidas to surrender or withdraw left with no options he moved. The battle lasted for about 3 days and after which all 300 Spartans were killed. The Spartan defeat was not the one expected as a local shepherd named Ephialtes defected to the Persians and informed Xerxes of a separate path through Thermopylae, which the Persians could use to outflank the Greeks. This movie should rock out!! Can't I give it more than a 10? I was among the non-press people who got to see a pre-screening of this film in Los Angeles and it is unlike anything I've ever seen on film before. Stunning, awesome, amazing, incredible - the superlatives continue to flow as I think about the impact of this film. First, visually it is eye-popping and the kudos heaped on Zack Snyder are well-deserved. It is very artistic with a unique look but it is never cartoonish. This is a breakout film for Zack, and should also be for Gerard Butler as King Leonidas, catapulting him into the higher echelons of Hollywood royalty. Admittedly, I've been a fan of Butler's for more than a couple of years now, but when this film was first announced I wasn't so sure it was ""my cuppa tea"". Then I saw the footage at Comic Con last summer and became excited. But even that didn't prepare me to be so blown away as I was by the film in its entirety. Butler's Leonidas dominates, and gives us a very multi-dimensional king whose love for his country, his soldiers, his son, his Queen and his freedom is enormous and the driving force in all he does. Lena Heady's Queen Gorgo is one of the best kick-ass parts for an actress I've seen in a long time. She is a perfectly matched complement and full and equal partner to her king. More than once I found myself cheering out loud for her. She makes sacrifices on the home front, to gain support for her husband's battlefield pursuits, that are just as heart wrenching as those her King makes. The other Spartans, David Wenham's Dilios the storyteller, Vincent Regan's Captain, Michael Fassbender's Stelios, all contribute important dimensions in illustrating what makes these men such an elite fighting force. There are many battle scenes, but they never drag on endlessly. Each is compact and efficient, and there are even moments of humor scattered among the severed heads and limbs. The violence is very stylized, reminiscent of V for Vendetta, and didn't make me turn away. The soundtrack is fantastic, with loud, heavy metal during battle scenes and more in the background at other moments. There are some lines in this film that should become oft repeated classics - ""This...is...SPARTA!!"" is only one of those. March 9 cannot come soon enough for me, because I can't wait to see this on the IMAX screen. This is a NOT TO BE MISSED film for men, women, Frank Miller fans, Star Wars fans, LOTR fans (but not children - it definitely earned its R rating). To those who fault the historical inaccuracies, neither Zack Snyder nor Frank Miller ever intended this to be a documentary on Greek or Spartan history. It is a fantasy story based on an event that really happened, call it ""History Meets Middle Earth"" intended to entertain, not educate. I hope it can be viewed from that perspective by others, and maybe it will inspire some who see ""300"" to study the truth behind the fantasy.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"""Spartan! Come back with your shield, or on it.""","The key of Zack Zinder's epic style of film was to take the action event and turn it into a mythology¬Ö He wanted to get to the essence of the Spartans, and to show us the story of a handful of soldiers willing to risk all for a larger western concept of freedom and liberty""300"" is an interpretation of a complex historical event, the collision of cultures that continues to this day¬Ö Spartan warriors and Persian soldiers were probably the most extreme cultures of that momentThey were interesting elements of truth in Zinder's movie: The Spartans were not like the Athenians¬Ö They lived under more barbaric rules¬Ö Every Spartan was a soldier¬Ö They fight as a specialized unit (""That's the source of our strength!""). Once they get this right group of iron, brass and muscles they become almost undefeatable (""Today no Spartans die!"").If you're a Spartan citizen you're a soldier (""Spartans! What is your profession?""), you're a pure warrior struggling for justice and for what you believe is true¬Ö The Spartans remain a mystery to everybody¬Ö They were, probably, unique¬Ö Till the day of the clash, they have never met an adversary who could offer them what they call 'a beautiful death.' They only were hoping with all the massive army gathered against them, there might be one down there who's up to the task (""Spartans! Ready your breakfast and eat hearty... For tonight, we dine in hell!"").Both the Spartans and Samurai warriors were comparably fierce and passionate (""No prisoners! No mercy!"")... They were raging soldiers (""Give them nothing but take from them everything!"")¬Ö But at the same time they had an absolute code of honor on the essence of being a Spartan¬Ö And it's cruel, very cruel¬Ö When a boy was born, he was inspected¬Ö If he's been sick or deformed, the child is murdered¬Ö From the time he could stand, he was taught not to retreat, never to surrender¬Ö He was taught that death on the battlefield in service to Sparta was the greatest glory he could achieve in his life¬Ö At the age of seven, all the boys were taken away from their mothers and plunged into a world of violence, turning them into growing men, ultimate warriors the world has ever knownKing Leonidas (Gerard Butler) was a legendary hero, somebody special¬Ö His name was the descendant of lions¬Ö He was very powerful, very thoughtful and perhaps in the film far more human than he is even in the graphic novel... Leonidas was a practical man whose life is matched by a straight road to one gleaming moment in destiny and that day, he couldn't meekly swallow the insult of Sparta's submission to the world of Xerxes¬Ö ""This is Sparta!,"" as he shouted to Xerxes' emissary, affirming that there is no softness, no place for weakness, and only the hard and strong may call themselves SpartansWhat I loved about Leonidas was his needs, in his moment of indecision, of a back-up, maybe a second opinion, some assurance of his wife Queen Gorgo¬Ö So we see him, both times, looking to his wifeQueen Gorgo (Lena Headey) was a great character not only in the film but in history¬Ö She was sexy and beautiful and above all tough and aggressive¬Ö There was intensity, elegance and ability in her¬Ö Also a kind of femininity in her nobility... There's only one moment when she loses it at the end and it was not a breakdownWe know lot of Queen Gorgo thanks to Herodotus, the father of the history, who chooses to write about her which clearly demonstrate she was significant¬Ö Spartan women were special anyway, they were incredibly beautiful and Sparta was the land of beautiful women¬Ö They were beautiful because they were physically fit, because they were allowed to exercise¬Ö They were not repressed and were considered incredibly potent¬Ö Gorgo could speak among men because as she affirmed it before the Persian emissary: ""Only Spartan women give birth to real men!""Gorgo's one love scene with Leonidas and the dialogue beforehand, was powerful: ""It is not a question of what a Spartan citizen SHOULD do nor a husband, nor a king.

"Woh, mama mia what a movie!!!","I have been waiting for a long time to see a good movie and this time has come at last because 300 isn't just a good move it is out breathing, outstanding and everything i can say is little. Firstly I believed that it was just an ordinary Hollywood movie and just like many others It would be good just to pass your time. But I was wrong, because this movie has everything, an excellent story based on the comic 300,fantastic images that travels you in an other world in ancient times, very good cast and a very good music full of emotions.First of all I want to say that when you see the movie it is just like you read the comic, that means the director and the design art group tried to transfer every little detail of the comic to the big screen, and they did it successfully! Secondly I must say that the cast was very good chosen, for example Gerard Butler fits perfectly to the role of the ancient Greek Spartan king whose first priority in his life is to defend his country (Even though I believe Spartan's have perfect bodies I am not so sure if Leonidas had such good ventricular as Gerard Butler has :) ).His personality shows the elements which indeed Spartans have ,braveness patience and pride. On the other hand the whole image was fantastic , especially the scene with the ships which crash on the rocks made me feel that I was in reality in the specific environment. I really pull over my hat to the 3D graphics art team which did an very fascinating work.Additionally I would like to say that this movie made me feel proud because I am Greek and shown the image of the Greek soldier, which puts his country above anything and would give the last drop of his blood to save it from the intruders. Of coarse this movie doesn't has a historical prescience but it is based in a true fact that 300 brave man fight against the most powerful army on the ancient world, the Persian. The thing which I admire to Frank Myler is that before he starts writing his comic he first has visited Sparta and Thermopyles (Hot Gate) to be inspired .Also Myler was very well informed about the Greek history and he included many historical facts, for example the Spartans indeed they thrown or their children in specific hole in the mound if they had a genetic problem. Moreover I think Frank Miller inspired the story about the young Leonida who killed the beast and return to his home from a story of an ancient Sparta boy. This boy was thrown also in a hole in the mount because it was lame but also very clever and very lucky because survived from his fall on the rocks. After that he noticed a fox who was passing around and came into the hole, he followed her and he found a passage to get out of the hole. After he has return to his hometown he was accepted because of his courage to fight for survivor. I really admire Frank Myler because he combined the true facts with his imagination without making a comic with no sense and with historical imprecision. Not only he respected the ancient Greek spirit but also he made an art work which hymns our ancestor and we should make him a statue for that.I have read somewhere that this film was made just to promote the war between east and west world! And at this point i totally disagree because if the most powerful nation of this planet wants to start a war it will do it without hesitating and without asking .Come on let's forget all about the conspiracy hidden behind the movie and just concern about the movie it's self.After all it is a combination of history and a myth but the result is marvelous.For example why should i criticize god of war (or god of war II) which is an excellent game and is inspired from the Greek mythology but it isn't based in true historical facts?As an conclusion I would suggest you to go and watch that movie and you will have a great time and you will adore it as I did. Have a good time!",10.0,Anonymous,Action

"The ultimate, raw fanboy-fodder","The experience of watching ""300"" is much like unravelling a candy box of action goodies, glazed in pure testosterone. Certainly fanboys will hungrily lap it up ¬ñ and although it is neither a very nutritious nor lasting meal, it'll give you a high of cheap thrills and gore galore for a solid and surprisingly swift 2 hours of runtime. I got to see the film at a preview in Paris and the demographic make-up of the theatre was some 98% men, 1.9% their girlfriends ¬ñ and me.Storywise, ""300"" does not throw the net wide: it narrowly zooms in on the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. as led by Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his 300 elite soldiers against 1 million Persians led by Persian God-King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Much has been sacrificed to pursue this sliced-down-to-the-bare-essentials trajectory, but the story is diluted by the dutiful formula ingredients of father-son relations, talkative politics and amour. These are all pitiful story lines woven together by the core battle ¬ñ what we really wish to see. However, I will concede that they are highly necessary in the film in providing relief in between the epic attacks.There is always a crux with primarily visual-driven films, and in ""300"" this problem is reality. Forget the actual events at Thermopylae ¬ñ this is trivial to the story the film wishes to tell ¬ñ the problem is that it lacks authenticity visually and dramatically. Owing to the narrow cleft by the beach in which all of the battle takes place, dramatic scenery is sparse by nature (unlike, for example, LOTR where landscape alone provided visual stimuli). To compensate for this, post-production has gone absolutely overboard with a throbbing CGI-overdose to fit Frank Miller's graphic novel format ¬ñ even the sky is so √ºber-stylized with sepia-tinted shades and shadowy contrasts that the cumulative effect is special effects gaping, swallowing and ultimately drowning ""300"". In the end, there is only a tiny shred of reality left, so distant that you need binoculars to make it out, and this is expected to ground the whole spectacle. Needless to say, this proves a wholly impossible task for director Zack Snyder.When you couple this visual fantasy with antique, readily-molded speech dialogue, there is regrettably even less authenticity left. Everything feels unbelievably staged, from Lena Headley's impossibly rehearsed counsel to her husband to Gerard Butler's rallying tagline cries. It should however be noted that nearly all of the the cast perform well in their respective parts. Headley in fact finds a surprisingly firm footing in a character that is largely at the mercy of an underwritten nature. The damsel in distress? The tough-chick? The aloof queen? A concerned mother? A loving wife? She locates them all and merges them together in the character of Queen Gorgo. Gerard Butler manages to weave together good screams, nice abs, a fair authoritative presence and not much else into a performance. The most huh-eliciting actor's presence is by far David Wenham who may look amazingly good, but provides silly narration that is altogether incongruous to the steaming macho vibe of the rest of the film. Most of the time he sounds like a hobbled little magician, selling trinkets in the bazaar. The rest are something of one-dimensional goons, but the eerie, puzzling performance by Rodrigo Santoro deserves credit, resonating with Lawrence of Arabia undertones but blown so far out of proportion the whole affair becomes a theatric affair.In spite of the aforementioned problems, ""300"" basically achieves what it set out to do. It is, in effect, an extended version of its adrenaline-pumping trailer, fit for fanboy worship and art-house cinema mockery. You have to admire the blatantly homo-erotic parade of well-oiled six packs, the dramatic symmetry in the epic battle visuals and the goose-bumps inducing scope of the spectacle. One of my favourite parts of The Lord of the Rings trilogy was the massive attack of the oliphants on Gondor, and ""300"" offers similar but even more OTT extracts with Persian invaders, who bear an eerie resemblance to the south Mordor recruits from the saga.7.5 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Action
They gave their last breath to defend it!,"This movie is a great and almost perfect conversion of Frank Miller's comic book. You should keep in mind that this movie is neither a documentary nor a historical disquisition about the battle of thermopylae. It's just a bloody ACTION MOVIE with lots of special effects. The battles are visually stunning, grandiose staged, well-choreographed and breath-taking. You can admire the fights in slow- and fast motion and with good background sounds. Gerard Butler's (Leonidas) performance was incredible, nobody fits better in the role of Leonidas! Of course there are not many dialogues in which he's involved but then, at last, when he screams ""THIS IS WHERE WE HOLD'EM. THIS IS WHERE WE FIGHT AND THIS IS WHERE THEY DIE!"" you will know why he's the perfect Leonidas. This movie is also full of symbols: The arrow's will blot out the sun, armies cause the earth to tremble, soldiers are moving like gazelles...In my opinion this is movie is pure entertainment and the new benchmark of bloody action movies.

Computer-Effects Extravaganza Better Than I Expected,"300 Once again, not having high expectations turned a movie into a pleasant surprise.

I've seen a number of films with a lot more action than in here. When they did have it, unlike a lot of other films, the carnage didn't go on and on. It lasted a few minutes at most and broke for a lull.The only aspect I thought was sub-par was some of the dialog, which sounded juvenile in spots. That and, at least for me, I found myself unable to get involved with any of the characters.

"one of the most elaborate, yet shallow exercises in 21st century epic style you'll see this year","300 comes way of Frank Miller, the ultra-famed comic book artist and author (behind the neo-noir Sin City), and Zack Snyder, who brought us the remake of Dawn of the Dead (not a shame nor not a necessity from the original), and it's what movie audiences probably salivate for when it comes to action epics from a time period dozens of centuries ago. But because it's Frank Miller, and he's never one to skimp on being garish, gory and a tad shallow with his take on certain topics, be they 40s pulp-fiction clich√©s or Batman or a Spartan battle like here, it's the farthest thing from naturalism. Snyder knows this, and decides to go for broke, albeit extremely faithful to the source material (and I say this having not read this graphic novel but having read other Miller works), and it becomes another case of a comic-book getting pumped up like some kind of wild cinematic toy, in this case probably with steroids. But to say that it pretty much becomes style over substance would be too easy, because the problems that come up in the film are not just in the substance, but also in what starts to hit the viewer over the head. Not that there aren't a good many memorable, bloody and exciting images that could only come from the f***ed up mind of Miller, but there is still the all-too basic qualities to the substance too.I know I shouldn't make too much of an issue with something like substance in a film that supposes right away what its audience is: men, more than women (although I wouldn't count them out as fans entirely) into seeing men be MEN, warriors out for the kind of glory that comes with legends. The basic legend for the battle of 300 is that there were about 300 Spartans, led by Leonidas (Gerald Butler), who was the ambitious king who decided to take on the king of Persia, who claimed to be a God, instead of submitting Sparta to the rule of the Persian empire, and with it going through extremely brawny moves to not stop till the last Spartan laid to rest. More or less that, anyway, as Miller throws in certain, or make that extreme, 'peculiarities' with both sides. The Spartans, for example, consult an oracle, who is some girl that contorts around like she's in an emo music video, and there's a deformed hunchback-outcast, who turns on the Spartans and tries to bandwagon with the mega-pierced, sexual-maniacal 'heathens' that are seen as the Persians. The Persians, by the way, may not have the greatest/most blood-thirsty of warriors, but they do have ninjas with masks, and a rhino, a deformed-barbaric homunculus, and a few ""clumsy"" elephants. Plus, that king/God, who's ultimate shame is that he's proved by his own people to not be a God, I guess, by Leonidas's last throw of a spear.So, as one might gather, there is a lot of 'things' going on in 300, though as far as stuff with historical pertinence, not so much. There's a fairly predictable and straightforward sub-plot with Leonidas's wife (Lena Heady) back in Sparta having to put up with a traitor in her midsts, though one she succumbs to partially. But for the most part, we're submerged into characters who redefine what it means to be 'one-dimensional', and while the acting is never actually all that bad, even from the usually barking Butler, the words Miller gives them don't do much to make it sound anything more than, well, a comic-book. Which is OK in bits and pieces, until the feeling of being practically detached from reality wears thin, including getting inundated with narration, lifted by Snyder likely from all those narration boxes one sees all the time (and somehow seemed to work better in Sin City) and during some of the BIGGEST dramatic action sequences. It may sound like the substance is a bit too much to bear and that I, as part of the audience, took it all too seriously. This is not exactly the case, really, as the storytelling in and of itself is fairly strong and worthwhile to tell- it's just that not taking it seriously makes it enjoyable in the shallowest ways possible.This is sort of amped up to 11 by how Snyder puts all of this together technically. It's another stepping stone for the world of combining CGI and live-action, where blood and body parts and heads roll off in a disgustingly enthralling way, and where environments are almost TOO dark &/or lush. There are actually very great images as well, unexpected ones, like when we see some of these walking abstractions of violence and mayhem from the Persians, or some kind of goat-man during the Persian's strange orgy scene. Even the battle scenes, sometimes, are worthy of the best parts of Braveheart and Gladiator. Yet sometimes there is too much, as with the narration, of pushing the boundaries with the style- slow-motion, for example, gets about 3/4 of the attention for all of the battle &/or anything remotely action related in the film, and Snyder's tactic with his DP and editor is to speed up for a moment, then slow down, speed up, slow down, over and over during a battle scene. It comes very close to completely abusing the usage of 32fps in action, for no good reason no less.All this aside, I'm still glad I saw 300, at least the one time on a gigantic IMAX screen where the contorted camera angles, machismo-rousing moments, and the epic sweep of a production done in such a weird way made it a fun, gory trip.

impressive,"seen this movie 2 days ago and went to see it again yesterday. I was so impressed the first time i saw it. I love these kind of movies, brains on zero and just enjoy the spectacle. i go to the movies to be entertained, not to cry or think. this was a great entertaining movie, the action scenes were great, the heroism was great. it reminded me somewhat (not in terms of story) of The Matrix and Gladiator, unrealistic heroism with spectacular fights and special effects. It was also amazing how time flies when your in the theater watching this movie, i thought it was going for about an hour but when i looked at my phone it was almost 1 hour and 45 minutes going. A must see for all people that like heroism, gore and spectacle.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Wonderfully visceral and testosterone¬ñfuelled experience,"Before, during and after watching this movie I realize this movie was made with just one purpose - to entertain. No social messages, no character study. Just plain fun. Well, maybe not so plain, but sure as hell lots of fun.I have not read the book; hence I am not in a position to judge how true the movie stays to the book - in look or in feel. Watching the movie in itself is such a wonderfully visceral and testosterone¬ñfuelled experience that it stands for itself apart from the book.In essence, Snyder has taken the elemental attraction from what was Blade's Blood-Bath or Matrix' Security Shoot-out and made an entire movie out of it. Over-done? Heck no. Exhausting? Heck Yeah!The movie depicts the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C of 300 Spartans that held the Persian Army of thousands for three days (giving Greece enough time to raise their own army for defense) before falling, but told in Frank Miller's heavily-exaggerated and violently Politically Incorrect style. Gerard Butler plays the bearded, screaming Spartan King.The exaggerations of Spartans into Herculean warriors and of Persians (and their army) into grotesque mutant abominations are as much a part of fictionalized and stylized story-telling as are the fantastic beauty-enhanced visuals. From the expansive use of Slow-motion (most of the movie was shot at high-speeds between 50-150fps vs a norm of 24fps) and painting the movie in shades of only three colors (Black to White, Yellow to Brown, Red) to the extensively choreographed battle moves and formations ¬ñ this movie does not have a single frame that does not look like an art-still. And as a story-teller, Snyder (or Miller?) spins his tales large but roots it firmly within the world realized in the movie with a dramatic voice-over by David Wenham (much like his Faramir of the LOTR trilogy). And the movie has some amazing dialogues - as dramatic and exaggerated as everything else within the movie. (Xerxes: Cruel Leonidas demanded that you stand. I require only that you kneel.) Snyder has set a new bench-mark for stylized visuals with this movie ¬ñ something that tends to be set too often now-a-days. But upping the ante can only bring better things to us as viewers. 300 is exactly what it set out to be. Looking for historical facts, trying to tie it down to current events or expecting deeper meaning within this fun-fest is being fool-hardy.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Ignore the morons dragging the rating down,"A legitimate review that brings a movie rating down is fair, but to rate it 1 star is to suggest it is one of the worst movies folks have seen. Fine, you didnt like it, you didn't like the glorification of a race of people in history or their alleged practices. It's a story, the dialogue and cinematics are extremely good, especially for it's time. Can people not give honest ratings these days? I give this a 10 because it is literally one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have watched it 5 times now and -still- enjoy it thoroughly. It seems infathomable to me that so many people can genuinely say it is aming the worst movies they have ever seen without believing that there is some agenda to drag the rating down in a disingenuous way. The rating graph clearly illustrates the lies of these folks. For there to be a bell curve around 8 and a spike at 1 makes no sense. I wish there was a way to filter out the '1' votes on imdb to identify a more realistic rating on movies and filter out the folks that don't vote genuinely.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"A pleasure for the eye, but not for the heart","As I entered the theater, I was expecting a film that would definitely have a unique and innovating idea to the usual films that are related to this genre. But by innovating, I meant in an aspect of a filmmakers holistic perspective: from the way the screenplay is written, to the way the idea is shown in a new graphic model. 300 did a marvelous job with the second, but it failed with the first (which is undeniably the most important step on any film-making). As you see the story unfold, you are taken into a world that somewhat wants to express an idea of honor, courage and glory, but you don't sense that within the characters. Yes, a certain passion is seen and greatly heard, but the connection and attachment of the actors with the audience is just not at the level of the artistic work that was put behind this film. In other words, what you see is more of a collage of beautiful scenarios and effects, but you just can't get a hold of the transcendental emotion of a human struggle and journey for a purpose. By the time you reach the end of the film, it seems to get stronger, but then, it is just too late to gain a true meaning of the plot.It's not an evolution of film-making, but it is definitely, a first step to something greater. Do see it, but don't expect to come out of the theater with a story that would keep you talking, cause it won't.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
300 is a masterpiece ignore the inferior trolls,"Anyone who thinks this is a 1/10 film is delusional and most likely brain dead, absolute morons.

Absolute must see masterpiece.Even Jeremy Jahns probably the #1 YouTube movie reviewer give this his highest grade of Awesomtacular.Also who cares if it's not historically accurate, it's a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
THIS IS... A GUILTY PLEASURE,"300 is an absurdly silly film. That being said, it's one that really wants us to take it seriously, but to me at least, it fails to get me properly committed to the film's characters and paper-thin story-line. But hey, at least this movie is stylish. So very, very stylish.Persians are trying to invade Sparta. Gerard Butler, king of Sparta, doesn't want this to happen. He gets together 300 fierce Spartan warriors to battle the invading Persians. That's your plot. There's few movies I can think of that are actually easier to follow; Memento or Mulholland Drive this ain't. There's a sub-plot involving Butler's wife doing stuff back in the city, but it's a side-story that feels tacked on. One of my biggest issues with the film is the way this added sub-plot frequently kills the pacing of the film, with the cutting between it and the main story never really feeling seamless. Maybe such unnecessary scenes could have been cut, and instead we could've got a bit more character development for the Spartan warriors. So we actually, you know, cared about them as they became attacked by more and more Persian forces as the movie went on.Some would argue that the movie really doesn't need a plot because the style and action scenes in this movie are very impressive, but I think a compelling narrative and fleshed out characters would've helped make this movie more than just a decent guilty pleasure. I don't always like to compare movies, but I feel 300 does often try really hard to be Gladiator, so I might bounce back and forth a little between the two. Gladiator's actually one of my favourite movies of all time, and would probably even earn a spot in my top 25 favourite films. Like 300, it has thrilling action and a great sense of spectacle (it should be noted though that it is a bigger film than 300- it feels more like a traditional Hollywood epic), but it also had narrative elements that I thought were actually quite strong. I actually cared about Russel Crowe's Maximus (a great performance from Crowe, by the way), and I wanted him to get his revenge on the corrupt piece of work that was Commodus, played extremely well by Joaquin Phoenix. The film gave us a protagonist we wanted to root for, and an antagonist that we really wanted to see brought to justice, and therefore we become invested in the film, and this allows the inevitable final showdown between the two to be extremely intense. Add in a bunch of memorable side characters, notably those played by Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, and Djimon Hounsou, and you have a movie that's elevated from being just another brainless action-packed revenge film to something that I believe is a near-masterpiece.Gerard Butler's King Leonidas is... slightly harder to care about. He's a fairly flat, slightly arrogant character- look at the way he just ignores his kid in the scene where he leaves for battle. Gerard Butler's no Russel Crowe either, and maybe a better actor could have injected some more likability into the character. And sure, Phoenix did ham it up in Gladiator, but his character was still believable in the film's context. In 300, we get a completely ridiculous central villain who is so over the top it becomes impossible to take him seriously. At all. He is one of the least menacing villains I've ever seen. Almost every thing about him makes me laugh- his theatrical poses, his slow motion yelling, his ""bling,"" his painted-on eye-brows, and his voice, which is about 3 octaves lower than you'd think it would be by just looking at him. Why's he so tall as well? Seriously, this is one of the silliest villains I can recall in any movie I've ever seen.The rest of the characters are disappointing too- Lena Headey plays the queen as a cold, boring woman, rocking the same facial expression throughout the entire movie. Dominic West is underused here too; he just kind of lurks around making creepy advances towards Headey's character. A few of the 300 Spartans get some character development too, but it's all pretty limited.I guess I'm being too negative here. There are things about this movie I like, so I'll just finish off the rest of the negatives first. The narration is forced, mostly unnecessary, and goofy as hell. The movie has some humour, but I often can't work out what's intentionally funny and what's unintentionally funny. The slow motion usually works, but sometimes feels gratuitous.But sometimes this movie can get pretty cool/fun. You can say what you want about the acting, the script, and the lack of truly compelling characters, but Zack Snyder really does inject this film with a whole lot of visual flair. Without the unique style, this film would be almost worthless, and it's the film's main saving grace. It really does look like a comic book in motion, maybe not to the extent of Sin City (a much better film in my opinion), but close. Also, the actions scenes are awesome, and there's quite a lot of them after the first half hour or so. Slow motion, blood spraying, limbs flying everywhere, Persian bodies piling up- it's a spectacle of carnage, and may well have to be seen to be believed. If you go into this film hoping to see a number of awesome, large-scale action sequences, you won't be disappointed. When this movie shows fight scenes, it commits. Those slow motion long shots that show the Spartans advancing towards the Persian forces, dispatching them as they continue to walk, are pretty awe-inspiring. Also, the ending to this movie I'll admit is pretty good. It's meant to have a fairly profound impact on its audience, I think, and it didn't shake me to my core or anything, but it worked. It was a pretty strong ending to the film I guess.So, final verdict? This movie's a bit of a mixed bag, with strong action scenes and direction, but unremarkable story-telling, characters, and acting. How much you enjoy this movie will probably come down to how much you enjoy its unique visual style, and that is honestly completely subjective. So give it a watch, and even if it's a movie you hate, at least it'll be good for a laugh. I mean seriously, the ""TRAITOR! TRAITOR!"" scene is Monty Python-esque. So does 300 work as an action movie? Definitely. Does it work as anything more than that? Not really, which is why I can't enjoy it as much as Gladiator, or, to a lesser extent, Braveheart. It's kind of on the same level as Troy: dopey, silly, and shamelessly promoting style over substance. But hey, that's not always a terrible thing, right?",6.0,Anonymous,Action
"Zack Synder's first film, its well done and Synder can direct any movie","""300,"" I learn, reflects the book almost panel-by-panel. They lean so heavily on CGI that many shots are entirely computer-created. Why did I like the first, and dislike the second? Perhaps because of the subject matter, always a good place to start. ""Sin City,"" directed by Robert Rodriguez and Miller, is film noir, my favorite genre, taken to the extreme. ""300,"" directed by Zack Snyder, is ancient carnage,taken beyond the extreme. ""Sin City"" has vividly- conceived characters and stylized dialogue. ""300"" has one-dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud. The movie involves a legendary last stand by 300 death-obsessed Spartans against a teeming horde of Persians. So brave and strong are the Spartans that they skewer, eviscerate, behead and otherwise inconvenience tens of thousands of Persians before finally falling to the weight of overwhelming numbers. The lesson is that the Spartans are free, and the Persians are slaves, although the Spartan idea of freedom is not appetizing.All true enough. But my deepest objection to the movie is that it is so blood-soaked. When dialogue arrives to interrupt the carnage, it's like the seventh-inning stretch. In slow motion, blood and body parts spraying through the air, the movie shows dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands, of horrible deaths. This can get depressing.In old movies, ancient Greeks were usually sort of noble. Now they have become lager louts. They celebrate a fascist ideal. They assume a bloodthirsty audience, or one suffering from attention deficit (how many disembowelings do you have to see to get the idea?). They have no grace and wisdom in their speech. But you're unlikely to care, for such is the nature of myth and epic that characterisation and language exist only to serve the story. For all their bravery and bluster, Spartan deaths or injuries pluck no heartstrings - we neither know these men nor care about their fate. For all Butler's verbal anguish and warrior dexterity, he and his 300 are cartoon characters, simple archetypes of ancient epic, spitting vitriol and wielding weapons but ill-equipped to connect to those watching them on screen. The result is that the conclusion of this, one of the greatest stories ever told, is sadly fumbled.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Great entertainment!,"The Battle of Thermopylae is probably one of the most famous battles in ancient history, as it is often used as a prime example that the size of an army does not decide a battle. The reason for this lays in the fact that in Thermopylae, a small army of roughly 7000 Greek soldiers managed to defend themselves against the biggest army of its time, the Persians, which counted in its ranks more than 2,500,000 soldiers. While this is the main reason behind its importance, the battle has reached mythical status because it was also an example of courage, as when the battle seemed lost, most of the Greek soldiers retreated with the exception of 300 Spartans, who decided to put a tremendous last stand against their enemy. Their courage not only inspired 700 Thespians to join them, but also has inspired many notable works of art, most recently the 1962 movie ""The 300 Spartans"" and Frank Miller's 1998 comic book ""300"". Now, Miller's graphic novel is the basis of a new movie about Thermopylae: Zack Snyder's ""300"".""300"" can be summarized as the tale of the Battle of Thermopylae, as narrated by a Spartan soldier named Dilios (David Wenham) to his fellow Spartans. The story begins with a brief recounting of King Leonidas' (Gerard Butler) youth, and the events that made him the courageous leader he was. Years later, as a Spartan King, he receives the news that King Xerxes of Persia (Rodrigo Santoro) is on his way to Europe, and gives the chance to Sparta to join him in his quest for conquering the world. Prefering to keep his people free instead of paying tribute to Xerxes, Leonidas refuses, and prepares himself to defend his people. However, the Spartan council has been bought by Xerxes, and refuses to allow Leonidas to go to battle with the full Spartan army. Knowing that this will be his people's doom, Leonidas decides to take with him only 300 of his best soldiers and goes to battle the enormous Asian army alone.Adapted by Kurt Johnstad, Michael Gordon and Snyder himself, the movie is almost a word for word translation of Frank Miller's graphic novel, which as well was mainly based on Herodotus' writings on the subject. However, this doesn't mean that Miller's work (and the movie) is an accurate history lesson, as Miller's art takes enormous artistic liberties with the story, making the Battle of Thermopylae more mythic than realistic. While this of course may bother purists, it truly works in the context of the story (being after all the narration of a soldier), as an exaltation of the achievements of a country's army that of course demonizes its enemies. More an action film than a drama about war, the movie delivers good entertainment as the simple plot unfolds nicely despite some severe lack of character development.The film's highlight is definitely the visual look that director Zack Snyder uses for his movie. Using the same digital technique than Robert Rodriguez used for ""Sin City"" (another of Frank Miller's comic books), Snyder brings Miller's graphic art to life with an extremely faithful care for details, almost putting every frame of the comic book to screen. This highly stylized visual look not only extends to digital backgrounds and special effects, Snyder's movie uses slow motion, great choreographs and a superb art direction to create an operatic narration that, just like in Miller's comic book, accentuates the mythic traits of the story, showing Spartans as super-soldiers and the Persian army as a hellish array of monsters. While completely inaccurate historically, it fits the story Snyder is trying to tell, although this extreme care for the style often makes him forget to care for the substance.Now, ""300"" is without a doubt a great technical achievement and visually, a wonderful film to watch, but it has some major problems deep inside, with the performances by the cast being the top of the iceberg. While Gerard Butler has received a lot of criticism as King Leonidas, he is truly one of the best in the film, and does a really good job with what he has to work. The best in the film is David Wenham, who truly adds a lot of mood and atmosphere to the movie with his narration. Sadly, not everyone in the cast was up to the challenge, and one wonders if they were chosen for the part thanks to their physical looks instead of acting talent. Lena Headey, Michael Fassbender and Tom Wisdom are really the main offenders, who make some of the worse parts of the script look even worst with their poor delivery.Personally, I think that the movie's most serious problem is the lack of characterization in the story, as Miller's simplification of the Battle made most of the characters look two dimensional at best. While it is true that Miller remained true to Herodotus and that some lines came straight from his work, it's hard to stop noticing how silly some dialogs are. True, it's an action film, but a little more of care while developing the script would had been enormously beneficial. Another problem of the film is definitely Snyder's complete focus on the visual aspect of his movie. Don't get me wrong, I know that a movie like ""300"" isn't supposed to be a powerful drama, however, Snyder's visuals tend to get pretty overwhelming, with an excessive use of slow motion that while effective at first, soon becomes a tiring gimmick.While I do consider ""300"" to be a flawed film, I must say that it's pointless to judge it in terms of historical accuracy because it never attempts to be accurate and dwells more in the realms of myth. Many have criticized this aspect (as well as Miller's obvious political subtexts) without noticing that ""300"" is not here to illustrate, but to provide good entertainment, and despite all its problems, it achieves that purpose against all odds. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Action
The movie is exactly what it promised to be.,"This movie never promised to be the ultimate and definite historical movie about the Battle of Thermopylae. the movie instead promised to be a visual spectacle with big effects and spectacular action sequences. The movie promised to be simple entertainment and entertaining it was.It's like how entertainment should be; simple and deliciously over-the-top. ""300"" is of course a movie that deliciously goes over-the-top with its images and overall style. The Frank Miller graphic novel gets translated very well to the big screen in terms of its style and atmosphere. The entire movie is greatly comic book looking, with its backgrounds, characters and action. Just like the other Frank Miller graphic novel turned movie ""Sin City"", the entire movie was shot in a studio, with the use of blue- and green-screen, to give the movie an authentic, unusual but beautiful and spectacular looking visual style.Its style and characters make sure that you won't ever take this movie serious, unless you of course really believe that the Persian army used big over-sized misshapen, mutant looking creatures, Xerses really had such a deep voice and all of the battles happened in slow-motion. If you have a hard time coping with this comic book style and way of storytelling and interpretation of history, don't watch this movie and stick to historical books instead. But if you're simply interested in good quality action and entertainment, this is the perfect overblown blockbuster movie for you.The story is simple and its basically about the Spartans standing their ground, attack-wave after attack-wave. The story trows in some more plot lines, involving King Leonidas' wife Queen Gorgo, who tries to convince the council to send more military support to save her husband, who knows he's going to meet a certain death. The diversity between those two main plot lines of attack and mostly talking and corruption work out well. Had the movie only been purely action it would had become tiresome after a while, I am sure. Also especially since the action is mostly of the same. Every attack-wave they encounter more dangerous, better skilled and often also more ugly looking enemies. Like a computer game, in which you advance one level-up, after you've beaten the enemy.But yes, it's also a missed opportunity that they didn't stick to the true story, since it's far more interesting and in my opinion also more heroic as the story portrayed in this movie. But it's of course also more complex and because of that also possibly less entertaining. I've always been greatly interested and fascinated by the story of the battle of Thermopylae, so I've wouldn't minded some more accuracy but I can understand and appreciate the approach of this movie and its story of the famous battle. Still sort of too bad that they decided to go with a voice over that tells what happens on screen and what the emotions and atmosphere was. The images themselves should be powerful and perfect enough to tell all of this.Everything in the movie is just basically very black & white and doesn't get complicated. Meaning that the good guys are all extremely good and they look like perfect creatures, with perfect biceps and white teeth and the villains are extremely evil and look like monsters, also complete with bad teeth.Definitely true that the best parts were already in the trailer but the movie still has plenty of visual surprises and spectacular action in it. The idea and sight of 300 Spartans facing an over a million man large Persian army is both impressive as spectacular. The best parts are definitely the action sequences, that show the bravery of the Spartans and their fighting skills and tactics, against the poorly organized and trained Persian army.The acting by the way was definitely better than expected. From a movie like this you just don't expect grand performances. Gerard Butler was great as the roaring and heroic King Leonidas and David Wenham and Vincent Regan play some good supporting roles. Of course the dialog isn't much special but this again perfectly suits the comic book style of film-making.I don't think that is a movie that will ever grow into becoming a classic and therefor I feel that it's also slightly exaggerated that the movie is actually in the IMDb top250. Nevertheless it's a movie that shall always remain perfectly entertaining to watch.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"Based off of the Graphic Novelist's Frank Miller's adaption of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC, where few stood against many.","I am very appreciative of the Director's involvement. The age of the Director matters because it directs the biggest number of movie-goers, the 30 and under category. And the perspective of Snyder really gives the good kick in this film. An excellent soundtrack, the graphics are simply amazing, and the scenes an sequences couldn't be better. The film the 300 is about one of the greatest examples of heroism. This battle was literally a loss for the Persians, from casualty ratio. but of the 300, they die, but of the million Persians the Spartans take 20,000. This adaption of the action packed Frank Miller elaborates on the battle skill and strength of the Spartans, though vastly out numbered. Its the Greatest warriors the world ever new versus the many basic soldiers. Talent versus population.Frank Miller's influence has made it so much fantasy is added into the film. The monstrouscharacters of the Persians, or mutants add a very detailed and imaginative scenes throughout the film.Facing insurmountable odds, their valor and sacrifice inspire all of Greece to unite against their Persian enemy, drawing a line in the sand for democracy. The film brings Miller's acclaimed graphic novel to life by combining live action with virtual backgrounds that capture his distinct vision of this ancient historic tale.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Frank Miller should be proud!!!,"Every few years, a movie comes along and changes the way we see films!!! Star Wars, The Matrix, The LOTR Trilogy, Sin City etc. And 300 is one of those movies!! Never has a film been so visually stunning that sometimes you can't help but stop watching the actors just to examine the incredible backgrounds that seem to come to life!! One of my favorite scenes would have to be the oracle scene where a Spartan woman dances to see the future for Sparta!! It's an erotic and beautiful scene with amazing lighting and effects that are top notch!!! The plot for 300 is simple and straight forward, The Persian leader Xerxes plans to control the nation of Sparta, but Sparta being the brave and cocky nation, the King of Sparta wages war with only 300 Spartans to defend his nation. Of course, after being told the odd are against him by his own people, the King still leads his men to what he believes is a battle of freedom. The performances in this film are strong, the best being Gerald Butler as King Leonidas, every line he delivers with just right amount of passion and leadership that is needed for a king!! Also Lena Headey is great as the Queen of Sparta as is Dominic West as Theron and David Wenham as Dilios!!! Not to mention, Vincent Regan as the Captain who gives a heart-breaking performance at the tragic event of his son's death!! The action in this film is also major highlight!!! This is where the movie score really sets the tone for the movie as it never stops feeling epic!! You can tell that every fight was well choreographed and the slow-mo effects really help by showing the brutality of the violence, which is pretty gory!!! Heads fly off left and right, and limps are cut off like butter, but hey, THIS IS A WAR MOVIE!!! So to all the squeamish, this isn't the movie for you. But the best part of this film for me were the finally 20 minutes of the film, it's intense and emotional that you will changed by the end of the film!! But it also gives the audience the moral of never to stop fighting, no matter how impossible your odds may seem!!! 300 is an inspirational, action-packed, well-acted, and visually ground-breaking film!!! Like Frank Miller's other comic book adaption, Sin City, 300 sets the bare for how films should look and feel!! After the mediocrity that was Ghost Rider, 300 is the first great film I've seen so far this year, and hopefully not the last!! It's a film all can enjoy, even women, who will probably enjoy all the half naked men running around. My advice is to go see 300, if the acting and action aren't up to your standards, then just watch this amazing setting and effects, which alone will leave you breathless!!! My only little problem with the movie is the appearance of Xerxes, The Persian King!!! I don't know, but it seemed he looked more like a drag queen than a ruler!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Visually Stunning...not an epic however,"To Sum this movie up, it was indeed an excellent film.The visual features of this film were landmark and astounding. The acting was overall convincing, especially from those actors portraying Persians.The Fight Scenes were the most artistically choreographed battle scenes I have ever seen. The were astounding to say the least.The story itself has been told over and over again. Few stood against many for what they believed in and died as all people should, for something greater than themselves.However, due to that story, the movie was handicapped. That story could not provide a wide enough scope for this film. The scope of this film is only on that story, and some other minor and insignificant and under-developed sub-plots.Because of that handicap, this movie will never be quite as good as Braveheart, Gangs of New York, Saving Private Ryan, and other epics like those films.Still...extremely well done film by all involved. I highly recommend anyone to see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

the most enjoyable unintentionally funny movie I've seen in a long time,"Of all the ways to film the story of the three hundred Spartans who faced off against thousands of Persians at Thermopylae in 480 B.C., I guess the only way it should be told is in an exaggerated, bloody, thunderous battle epic style with severed limbs flying through the air and rivers of blood pouring over a battlefield. Another, much better medieval epic that took this approach was Mel Gibson's Oscar-winner ""Braveheart"" in 1994. But whereas ""Braveheart"" did this in an artistic style, ""300"" does it to the point where even the high-intensity bloody battle sequences do not become harrowing or heart-pounding, but rather a little silly.This is one of the most outlandishly over-exaggerated movies I've seen in a long time. It's so pompous and over the top, perhaps because it was based too much on the Frank Miller graphic novel that merely used the true story of Leonidas the 300 Spartans as inspiration. In the end, I did enjoy the movie, but not in the way that I believe the filmmakers wanted me to. I found the movie to be unintentionally funny because of the way it exacerbates with the clich√©s of his genre, but it is truly one of the most entertaining unintentionally funny movies that I've seen in a long time.Visually, ""300"" is a real treat. It's hilariously over-pumped lighting and CGI effects give it a real video-gamey appearance. The movie also puts this together with dialogue is that is absurdly corny such as Gerard Butler screaming ""This is Sparta!"" before kicking a Persian messenger, who falls in super-slow motion down into a pit. That's another thing I might as well poke fun at. Looking at ""300"", I oftentimes wonder if perhaps the director, Zack Snyder had made the movie and then realized that it was an hour too short and the only way to make it reach the intended length was to convert half the movie not only into slow motion, but *really slow motion. There's a scene where the Persians are riding toward Sparta and it takes about ten seconds for a horse to complete his stride. This scene, coupled with the corny narration, really stirs a generous chuckle from the audience.Also exaggerated are the battle sequences and the way the Spartans not only fight against Persians, but giants, men with giant blades for arms, and mutant men who look and sound more like the Urak-hai from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Persian king, Xerxes is comically portrayed by Rodrigo Santoro, who is graphically enlarged to the point where disbelief cannot be suspended and he is clad in so much glitter makeup and his voice run through a base amplifier so much that one cannot help but laugh at him instead of fearing or condemning him like they would have the real Xerxes.One might assume from the way I've been poking fun at ""300"" in my review that it was too cornball for my taste. But no, again, I had fun with the movie. I enjoyed it and there were some truly powerful moments, but the movie was just so exacerbated and over the top, maybe too much for its own good, that one cannot help but laugh and make jokes at it. And besides, maybe this movie will inspire good soldiers, for the Spartans were brilliant and powerful warriors and from what I saw in ""300"", all you need to be a Spartan, is have a six-pack, wear lots of baby oil on your skin, and be able to scream at the top of your lungs. Potentially, according to this film, half the people I know could be Spartans. Isn't that something?",7.0,Anonymous,Action
It grows on you,"From the time he could stand, he was baptized in a fire of Combat...From the time you start watching this movie you know you're in for a thrill. The storyline of isn't that complicated. Three hundred spartan soldiers go up against the might of the Persian empire. The dialog is simplistic and cool. Visually 300 is stunning. It will not only stand the test of time but it will get better with time. It is an instant classic and has all the ingredients a great movie needs.Politics? Who cares? This is a movie that gets your adrenaline going. I know this sounds sexist but if you're a real man you'll love this movie. It has the ""true"" macho quality that few movies manage to achieve. There are lines from it that pop into your head in everyday life when you see or hear certain things. Like ""The Matrix"", it creeps into your mind and lives there. It touches on the basic, primal human values and emotions but there is absolutely no sentimentality here. As the line goes: ""Theres no room for softness. Not in Sparta. Only the hard and strong may call themselves Spartans. Only the hard. Only the strong.""Go see this movie",10.0,Anonymous,Action
One-Eyed Reporter,"The title refers to ""the good friend"" character who gives a memorial speech at the end, presenting the legacy that grows to fantastic proportions on its way to us as narrator whose words are from another planet. Presumably you as a viewer will make the association I did the with the demigods of Olympus, so artificial and childlike are the notions this narrator presents. They are so simple and extreme, these notions of how the world is abstracted through one eye..It allows us to take a very few indicators and suppose a world. Deliberate deprivation of young boys is supposed to somehow instill valor. Flying blood droplets is supposed to somehow validate combat expertise. Tactical stubbornness leading to defeat is somehow celebrated, I suppose, coming very close to the 72 virgins bit. Yes, indeed, sometimes this slipped for me into the opposite of what it was intended to purify. The elixir of admiration for the west snapped to Zoroastrian soma more often than not.That's because the history is that the Persians (the Achaemenids were actually Medes, more like Afghans are today) were the great world-builders of the era, creating less a totalitarian state than a federation of free states that flourished by trade not terror. And the Spartans were the thugs, the warlords who oppressed and terrorized their neighbors, building a state based on pillaged wealth. Even the Nazi association is reversed, the Medes were the Aryans, the Spartans essentially African, and no longer extant in today's Greece.(Later, the Alexandran Macedonians, the Greeks of today, destroyed the by then corrupt and fragile Persian empire and all its great libraries and histories, torturing the collected scientists to death, in what has to have been the greatest and most brutal setbacks of civilization ever.)So the resonances with today keep oscillating in a strange and stimulating dance between the intended admiration of these thugs we are meant to feel as the west, and those of Islam. But that ""struggle"" is over issues as remote from this as swimsuits are from locomotives. Let's even say vinyl padded speedos.As a movie, the thing is oddly uneven. It's tied together by a consistent score, mixed of heavy metal and aeolian voices. And it does have a story, actually two; though simple, they span the thing and stitch pieces together. But there are distinct visual styles here, too many to integrate. I felt actually as if I were defending myself from some of them as they came at me just as the different components of the Persian army attacked the 300 hooting bodybuilders.Its inevitable I suppose, when the computer work is so massive it has to be parsed out to creative teams distributed all over the world, and they have nothing better to go on than a comic book. I will admit that some of the these teams gave me great satisfaction, some of them in the actual battle scenes where the speed-shifts worked to emphasize the mapping of comic panels into reality. This, if you follow such things, was developed by Peter Weir in ""Gallipoli,"" starring a then new Mel Gibson. Mel then sorta borrowed them for his own battle epic, including the early scene where he lops off a head. Here we emphasize the flying bodies, body parts and blood which quite literally become architectural. In fact there are three distinct architectural structures here made of bodies, and many others large and small made of living men.For me the center of the thing is the early scene where the oracle is consulted. Three bits of background.¬ó when I see this plot device early in a movie, someone with a vision (or dream or hallucination) I tend to see the rest of the movie as what's in that vision. In other words here, when this girl reports what she sees in the future, the report is the movie that follows, and that we see through her eyes. It works for me because then I can ascribe the limits of the vision I see to the character I know shaped it.¬ó one of my most valued movie experiences is a very early short film. Shucks I see my comment on it here at IMDb is deleted. (If anyone saved it, please send it to me.) Its a dancer with flowing garments that sail with her in space. Over this has been hand painted color that overlaps the boundaries of the fabric, the first spatial artificial effect in film. Its transporting, this century-old image. Its copied in many ways here with the oracle's appearance. She's a drugged young beauty, and they use this as an excuse to have her dance, with smoke, hair, skin and fabric tendrils weaving space, sex, sense, vision. The designers of this scene were used nowhere else that I could tell. Its an extraordinary bit of art.¬ó There's something inherently cinematic about redheads. All filmmakers know this. Its in many how-to shortcut books. But like other fundamentals, no matter how hackneyed it gets, it can still be effective. In a film of actors whose hair has been blacked to seem Greek (and elsewhere skin darkened to seem ""Persian""), they find an Irish girl to play the oracle. I guess she's pretty; it's hard to tell because she's less a person than the provider of hair and a nipple in a complex assembly, but there you have the redhead, first seen doing a Gilda hair introduction.I saw this in a theater with a friend and despite dangerous political twinges we got swept up in it, together with the people in the auditorium. I think there's an analogy between the brotherhood of the men we see, and the implied brotherhood of the people in the audience. It brought us closer through vision.

artistic view of history...,"I think this is really a great movie. Not because it has spectacular acting or some mind-breaking stories. This is adaptation of the comic book called ""300"" from Frank Miller who wrote the comic inspired by the story from movie ""The 300 Spartans"". Movie ""300"" is created exactly page by page and frame by frame like the comic book.

Spartans and Ancient Hellines: The Bravest Soldiers of all times!,"I am a big fan of Frank Millers job, and of course i think that ""300"" is one of his best books ever. The movie is based in the fact that 300 Spartan Soldiers with 600 Soldiers of Thespia (todays Fthiotida)were stood in a small passage, against the mightiest (in numbers) army of ancient times. In the movie (and the comic book) the 600 thespians are not included nobody knows why... I think that who ever want to watch the movie, knowing and feeling, what is really the story about, should definitely read the great best seller book ""Gates of Fire"" by Steven Pressfield. At last Hollywood discovered that the Ancient Greeks not only were the mightiest and most trained soldiers ever, but they kept Europe safe from Dynasty and slavery. It is the first movie that really shows how the ancient Greeks fought, killing with tactics and with no mercy. A critical detail about the man to man sword fights, between Persians and Greeks, is that the Spartan soldiers were ""dressed"" with an armory full of copper and the Persians were dressed with armories of wood or leathers, so they were easily splattered by the well trained swordsmen of Sparta... Anyhow we should give our congratulations to the makers and actors of ""300"" for ""teleporting"" us to the bravest and most crucial battle of all times!",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Snyder's most stylish film,"300 is a historical epic by way of a comic book movie and the results are highly entertaining. A hyper masculine fantasy that somehow manages to be homoerotic as well as homophobic with enough style and endlessly quotable dialogue to make up for that and a thinly sketched plot.Gerard Butler is a big reason for why any of this works. He knows exactly what the film needs from its leading man so he brings plenty of charm and most importantly shouts all the best lines in a way that makes them even cooler. It's highly likely none of the best lines of this film would work if he wasn't bellowing them out.Zack Snyder's next level fidelity to the source works wonders for this film. Recreating the frames in striking slow motion that works with rather than against the film, especially in its action. Tyler Bates' score is a mix of things that wouldn't feel out of place in something like Gladiator and heavy metal flourishes that turn the battles into a hyper stylised music video.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Is this the ultimate litmus test for latent homosexuality in the misguided soul of every heterosexual female-worshipping man-b***h or what?!,"What's hilarious is how incredibly dumb this movie is. What's even more hilarious is how glorified it is by it's legion of fans despite how brilliantly it's stupidity flashes through the overwrought attempts to hide it under all the paint-on tan, gay-stripper posturing and contorting, and orgasmic orgiastic all-male battle cries and fight scenes.Maybe that's the attraction. The movie was obviously made for idiots, gay men, liberated house wives, and the heterosexual man-b***hes who mindlessly serve them. Wow. If ever their was a cinematic phenomena for how pathetic the human race has become (or perhaps always was) then the success of 300 is proof of just that.If you liked seeing Sylvester Stallone in Rambo, half-naked, covered in sweat and mud, and blowing away communists like a five year-old lost in his own fantasy world shooting invisible bad guys then imagine that, dumbed down and visually amped up a hundred times and you've got 300.The noble(sarcasm), admirable(sarcasm) and sympathetic(sarcasm) Greek nation of Sparta who enjoy murdering their physically imperfect babies so readily it would make Adolf Hitler green with envy, and yet who still worship and are under the rule of a group of old deformed leprous wise-men who live on top of a mountain molesting underage girls they have put into a stupor with some sort of primitive date-rape drug (it seems like its okay to be born a physically imperfect Spartan as long as you're a pervert), are put in the dubiously honorable disposition by their hot-headed king when (after getting permission from his queen to act all psycho like the little mama's boy man-b***h that he actually is) he kicks some Persian messenger into a bottomless well and thus declares war on Persia before anyone else - the nation that is relegated to a military footnote by this decision between King psycho man-b***h and the cowardly wife-Queen hiding behind him - or the corrupt senate that has somehow turned against its own nation (gee I wonder why) despite its collectively physically perfect attributes - can bat a lash, say a word against it or hose their warhorse-of-a-king down to stop him from slitting all their wrists.This movie has to be a joke. It can't be expecting anybody with half a brain to take this premise as seriously as it seems to take itself.Are we supposed to be sympathizing with, relating to or finding these Spartan characters interesting in any way? The only thing they're fighting for is their already corrupt nation which seems rife with hypocrisy, stupidity, hatred and social turmoil to begin with which the military characters, the king and his 300 soldiers, that dominate the story seem either oblivious or indifferent to. So what exactly are they defending? A nation of baby killers who worship deformed leprous pedophiles while pretending to be a proud and noble culture? Ha! Don't make me laugh! Actually too late!And don't tell me about the battle scenes.I don't care what the history books say (history is filled with lies told by authoritative liars endorsed by weak-minded people dumb enough to accept it as truth) but there is no way 300 soldiers could withstand an oncoming crowd made up of thousands upon thousands of people, in this case full grown men armed and hostile, no matter what battle strategy was used. It's just physically impossible. If 3 people were standing in front of an entrance to an alley and 10 people rushed them there is no way they could prevent at least some of them from getting through. You'd have to be a f***ing idiot to believe otherwise.Of course the filmmakers would have you believe that the Persians weren't smart enough to rush the 300 Spartans all at once (I think the modern term for it is a ""stampede"" and is usually the result of mindlessly panicking cattle) with their tens of thousands of soldiers so instead of realistic battle scenes we get an hour and a half of endless shots of the Spartans hacking away at Persian soldiers who for some reason are all mysteriously separated by dozens of feet of space as if relentlessly swarming the Spartans and thus crushing and overcoming them with the sheer size and weight of their numbers never occurred to them.Wow. Talk about stupid and unrealistic. And supposedly using a battle strategy attributed to the mindless panicking of cattle was not obvious enough for the Persians, an insurmountable army that was already sweeping through the land conquering everything it came across.If you want to know how dangerously gullible, stupid and pathetic people have become in the Microsoft age then the success of this moronic feat of CGI overkill made by one of the most glorified film-making hacks out there, Zack Snyder, possibly Uwe Boll's illegitimate brother, is overwhelming proof that if you make something shiny, polished and pretty enough it doesn't have to work at all in any other way to get sold on the open market to the idiot masses.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

2 ways of seeing this movie,"This film has a dual nature: it's a bad historical movie and a good action one. It's the story of 300 Spartans that defied 600.000 Persians, but the 5000 Greeks (mainly arcadians) that fought there too are not even mentioned. That's why it's a bad historical movie (one reason from 300 others), but it's not the only reason. The fights have rhythm, the choreography is good, it's fun to watch. Yes, the film is racist: the good guys fight for peace and freedom (now where have we heard that before?) and the bad guys come from the Middle East and have suffered genetic modifications. If they put a mustache on Xerxes, I could swear he was Saddam or Osama.Do you know what is a bad historical movie and a good action movie all in one? A propaganda film.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Nice try.,"First, let me say that 300 was a good movie.However, it wasn't a *great* movie.Our print was grainy (I'm told a hazard of shooting Super 35), and the line between the set and the green-screen effects was painfully obvious. Periodically switching between ancient-inspired music and loud thrash guitar was annoying and distracting.Flaws in the green-screening aside, the visual design was stunning, there are no two ways about it. Several scenes were not merely inspired by Miller's work, they clearly took extra pains to *duplicate* Miller's art in a moving medium--a daunting task under any circumstances and several times pulled off with staggering precision. The violence--and there's a lot of that, too--is softened a bit by its game-like rendering. The performances were good, and Gerard Butler was magnificently intense as Leonidas.But.And let's be absolutely clear about this.The very last thing that Sparta would have gone to war for was 'freedom'. If you know the slightest history of that era, you know that. And when Snyder and Johnstad and Gordon decided to replace the graphic novel's central theme of 'duty' with 'freedom', they took a movie that I could've easily given an 8 or 9 to, to one that I can in good conscience give no more than a 6.Dispensing with heavy Spartan armor to emulate the classical Hellenic 'heroic nude' style is one thing: it's stylistic, and is in keeping with the look of the era as passed down by the great sculptor Phidias (a young contemporary of the actual events at Thermopylae, though certainly not there himself) and his even greater successor, Praxiteles.Dispensing with the entire reason the original 300 (and allies) died is another matter entirely: it's revisionism, nothing more. Sparta was emphatically not a state built on freedom, and had even less interest in preserving their great rival Athens' democracy (with whom Sparta promptly went to war once Persia's invasion was finally repulsed and the Greek peninsula was safe).Worse, it's the sort of revisionism that weakens the whole story from beginning to end, and reduces what could've been a great movie to a merely good movie.6/10, and I think it'll look better on your TV than it did on the big screen.

Its a diseased piece of work but it tickles the lizard brain something fierce with its strongman chic. SIN CITY had the same frighteningly empty, sterile charm. Both are illuminating in the worst ways.Its a treat to see movies completely lay it out like 300 does, to stop pussy footing around & admit they're down with the sickness. It doesn't matter if its not intended as a political primer or a history lesson, that kind of defence betrays profound ignorance of how completely this communal dream-time called the movies subconsciously shapes us.

In addition, I found the entire dialog to be non-original as if it was copy pasted from a bunch of other movies.I thought the first half an hour of the movie was very decent, it was thereafter that the dialog became extremely repetitive and corny. For instance, Leonidas giving the same speech over and over again in front of his army. Some things didn't even make any sense, as at one point he says something and an hour later he retracts it.Battle scenes take almost 90% of the movie. I love the battle scenes but after seeing an hour of that I grew tired, to be honest I was bored. I want to see 2 hours of fighting I order a UFC pay per view, when I watch a movie I want a decent plot and turn of events.Loud and deafening, my friends and I all came out of the movie with headaches, and I'm used to loud sounds and noises. Leonidas especially grows louder and louder by the end, to the point you just don't want to hear him again.I have no idea what's the purpose of all the ugly faces and lepers in the movie, or the Hunchback of NotreDamme for that matter.I must say I was disappointed greatly, and do not recommend this movie at all unless you're a guy under 18.In the end, I must say I can't believe anyone can get offended by this movie, I have read reviews of people from both Greek and Persian backgrounds, and this movie is so ridiculous that can only offend a child. 5 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Not a film for the cancel culture,"I decided to watch this film after visiting Thermopoli and actually feeling the sense of history in the surrounding countryside. To see and stand on the mound where the Persian army shot dead those 300 plus a few more with the 40000 arrows was emotionally inspiring.The film itself glorified, quite rightly these soldiers whose lives were completely focussed on defending their culture. Gerard Butler was a magnificent Leonidas, brooding, tough and immensely loyal to those who have put their lives under his command. The moody and dark dramatic graphics added depth and atmosphere. I loved it.All those who are whining about the films brutality cannot ever comprehend the actual horrific reality of war. Yes these 300 did hold back a 70,000 strong army for 3 days. Yes there was stabbing and maiming and blood, gore and death. No they ultimately did not win but that was not in question. These men willingly gave their lives for a few days respite for the Athenians but more than that they gave hope.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Speedos, pustules, and buckets of blood. It's called a Graphic Novel. We used to call them Comic Books","Initially Zack Snyder's 300, based like Rodriguez's violent, ugly, macho Sin City on a Frank Miller graphic novel, certainly has a distinctively derivative look. That is to say, it captures perhaps better than anyone before (despite so many movies made from comic books) the Frank Frazetta comic illustrator style. It's a kind of adolescent boy's dream world, austere, romantic, angular (like all comic book images (but doesn't that come from Forties Hollywood?), in dread of the ultimate teenage ugliness, acne (evidenced in gross skin eruptions) and full of perfect, acne-free super males dressed in Speedos and capes to show off their excessively defined abs and pecs. Miller's and Snyder's Spartans go into battle against the Persians at Thermopolae wearing almost nothing but their buffed-up muscles, which are the one thing the movie is ultimately about. This is a bit ironic, since they are very into using their round shields effectively. You'd think they'd consider some armor, but that would cut off our view of the abs and pecs. They wear helmets, but those are mainly an S/M style statement.The Persians, in stark contrast this season, are very wrapped up, sort of like desert Arabs, and their leaders are very into elaborate, peculiar, one-of-a-kind piercings (quite the rage among exotic movie bad guys these days). They also seem a perverse outgrowth of the Spartan's rejection of all abnormalities, which the Persian's use of legendary horned beasts and elephants and deformed human giants, are a contrasting embrace of. Notably, a grotesque hunchback on the Spartan side isn't allowed to fight and goes over to the Persians, where he's welcomed by the giant metro-sexual Persian leader Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), who wears not only piercings and chains but lipstick, fingernail polish, and painted-on eyebrows. But the Spartans too have a crew of elders they go to for advice, whose faces and bodies are covered with pustules. (They're a teenager's nightmare of old age.) The imagination here oscillates between idealized male (and very rarely female) perfection and disgust at everything and everyone else.The thinking behind this movie doesn't seem consistent. If the Persians are gay, how come it's the Spartans who go around in bulging Speedos? Whether you're gay or straight, you wouldn't really want to be on either side. And after a while despite or perhaps because of the highly stylized way the battle sequences are cranked out with slow-mo starts and stops and pauses for spurting blood, the color-drained images of the uniformly buff male bodies and Frazetta landscapes, which seem made of brush-strokes rather than dirt and stone, start to seen monotonous and repetitive. Surely any viewer who's seen Kurosawa's samurai battles, or more recently Clint Eastwood's realistic Iwo Jima footage, is likely to find this movie lacking in real action interest. It would be interesting to see an attempt to recreate the battle from history books instead of a picture book for adolescent grownups. As an antidote to this glorification of fake heroism, go and see Bruno Dumont's Flanders when it comes out in the US.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
OK for a comic book made into a movie,"This movie held my interest ... the acting was solid and dialogue interesting. The variety of different accents of the actors became distracting; it was hard to understand how the Spartans, living in one small city could have so many different accents! Also distracting were the cinematographic effects. I got tired of the slow motion, the sepia toned frames, the red toned frames, etc. Also distracting in this movie was the number of mutant humans. The battle scenes were quite interesting, but historically VERY inaccurate and most likely impossible as well. I also took great exception to Xerxes (the name of a real king) being represented as very different than the real person was. Also of note was the large numbers of Persians the movie had portrayed by Black persons; Persia is now Iran and there are very few Black Iranians! The whole movie struck me like a comic book brought to life - so if you are in the mood for a completely untrue, totally fantasy, completely impossible plot and you don't mind lots of mutants, strange lighting and colors, and ultra fake backgrounds, you will enjoy this movie! It does move quickly and the actors hold your attention.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

Good but not great,"No Spoilers The Digital Cinematography and the wardrobes were spectacular. The Persians and the various fighters were so well done and the spartan cloaks really got your arm chair general blood going. Everything else was just 'pretty good'. The problem with this movie is that it simply came a little too late. So many aspects of the film had already been beat to death. The lamenting sound of a woman singing in some foreign language during scenes of sorrow or death. The slow motion action sequences (however the first clash between persian and Greek was awesome). The woman walking through the wheatfield scenes reminded you too much of gladiator. The speeches are pretty good but when he finally says ""This is Sparta!!!!"" you cant help but laugh a little bit. The characters really weren't developed well either as i didn't really care whether the spartans lived or died (of course you knew going into it that they would die) but i didn't really care about their sacrifices either. I understand that this is not a completely faithful interpretation of the event and i had no problem with that. It is a different take from what we have discovered to have happened, yet the different story itself was rather weak. Then again its based off of a comic and although i am not a comic reader i think its safe to say that it lacks the depths of novel turned movies. The glorification of and dehumanization of one or both sides unfortunately often makes for a pretty boring storyline without much emotion. As dramatic and straightforward as the battle of thermopylae was, i believe they could have done much better in evincing emotions from the viewer as well. However, as an action movie, there is so much that the girl behind me wouldn't shutup about how she was going to be sick. Its a good movie to watch because the fight scenes are pretty good and the colors are fantastic but i left wanting more of a story.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Can't match the marketing campaign.,"And I don't just mean the posters and previews. I extend that campaign to include the amazing reviews that it can't possibly have garnered on it's own.

If I went in there expecting it to suck I would have been pleasantly surprised. It's not the ""evolution of film-making"" or whatever they're saying.

Absolutely the best venal movie since Birth Of A Nation,"What can you say about 300, a movie that is one long and woozy love letter to the ancient, war loving Spartans? That pictures infanticide and extreme child abuse as an admirable form of social engineering? Where the light skinned and English accented heroes slaughter vast numbers of their dark and stupid foes? Where to be a woman is to proudly bear sons for the Fatherland and stand by your man as he swaggers off to suicidal carnage? Where to be old, sick, malformed or effeminate is to be evil? That proudly wears its fascistic heart on its national socialist sleeve? Well, what you could say is that it is one fantastically entertaining movie!300 tells the story of the three hundred Spartans who held off the entire Persian army at Thermopylae. Sparta runs afoul of the Persians by refusing to submit to their rule. Treachery rears its ugly head and good King Leonidas is forbidden to use the Spartan legions to lay waste to the enemy. He sets out with three hundred doughy volunteers to hold the eastern horde off long enough for the Spartan senate to come to their senses. The eventual fate of Leonidas and his comrades is one of the most famous stories of ancient times and 300 more than does it justice.There are no real stars in 300 though Gerard Butler has a star-making role as Leonidas. He handles spear, beefcake poses and faux-Shakespearian dialog with equal aplomb. Lena Headey is very good as Queen Gorgo but can't rise above the fact that she is a chick hanging out in a boy's club. Her role is primarily to look decorative and stoic in equal measures. Beyond these two and perhaps Dominic West as a dodgy member of the Spartan senate or Rodrigo Santoro as the ten foot tall and supremely swishy Xerxes, there isn't a member of the cast well known or forceful enough to stand out from the rest. Everyone involved delivers fine performances but the fact is their roles are subservient to the design, emotionality and heedless energy of the piece.300 is another movie made on a virtual set. That is, with the exception of the actors, most of what you see isn't real, it's computer animated. While perhaps not as amazing as the similarly filmed Sin City or Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, 300's surreal copper and sepia-toned fever dream of ancient Greece is an achievement in its own right.300 is being damned and praised by all sides of the political spectrum. The fact is 300 could be used as a motivational tool for just about any group in need of a testosterone fix. It's guaranteed to get your guys on their feet and ready to rumple. Make no mistake though, there have been few truly excellent movies made with such dodgy sentiments since Birth of a Nation. Judged solely on the merits of it's politics 300 brings certain words to mind, ""venal"" and ""pestilent"" being the most polite. Judged as adventurous entertainment however, 300 has few equals.It would be easy to dissect 300 and lambaste its lack of historical veracity. After all the historical Spartans were sort of a bronze age Hell's Angels and were roundly hated by their long suffering neighbors. As to their vaunted militarism, even the effete Athenians were able to kick the tar out of them from time to time. This is all beside the point. 300 was not made for rational discussion. This is a movie made to bypass the frontal lobe and stir the Cro-Magnon id. It is supposed to get its audience frothing at the mouth. This 300 does with such dexterity and malevolent ingenuity as to render it an instant classic of its kind.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"300 is all guts, all glory, and mercilessly violent. Yea, that sounds exactly like the battle it was portraying","Shooting an entire movie using a green screen had been done before, but was perfected by Robert Rodriguez and his crew with Sin City, one of the most stylish films in cinema history. Same strategy for bringing a Frank Miller comic into the big screen was brought into shooting 300. Shooting virtually the entire film using the latest in green screen technology, audiences around the world are able to see yet another one of Miller's highly acclaimed works on the big screen. But, unlike Sin City, 300 seems to be inconsistent in its slick, raw style. Yet underneath the few moments of questionable imagery lie plenty of substance, great acting, fantastic directing, and a really powerful and nicely woven story. Boldly being able to go where previous epic movies just weren't able to go, 300 is another successful Frank Miller comic book adaptation that is sure to please fans and bring in some new ones as well.We have a very straightforward story here: in 480 B.C. Sparta is in grave danger, and their king, King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), isn't about to give up the kingdom without a fight. Defying all odds, he and his really small army of just 300 men take on the most vicious army human history at the time had ever witnessed. To be even more specific, 300 is basically a glorified look at the Battle of Thermopylae. While they all knew how it was going to end, their impact on the impending conflict amassed into a level that not even they could predict. Written by Frank Miller (and painted by his ex-wife Lynn Varley, who also provides the colors in this movie), 300 is not an adaptation but more like a translation (Something Rodruiguez claimed he was doing with Sin City), since it pretty much takes everything from the comic book and transforms it to film.Frank Miller time and time again has proved that he can make a good story, but it is up to others to be able to display this quality storytelling to others in another format. For the most part it succeeds, but then at other times, it doesn't. Zack Snyder deserves the most credit in making this an entertaining film. He plays with the speed of the story and hands it to us in a very stylish manner. The movie goes slow-motion, Matrix-slow even, and then on another instance goes insanely fast. Even better is that he does not hide the fights by zooming in on everyone, there is plenty of room on the screen to see all the carnage, and the well-choreographed fights. There were some epic battles in the graphic novel, and Snyder perfectly transcends it to the screen.The acting is superb as well. Gerard Butler, the main actor, resembles a scarier, more fearful-looking Russel Crowe from Gladiator. The standout star in 300 though is not him but instead his wife, played magnificently by Lena Headey. She proves to be more than just a pretty face involved in a sex scene as her acting stands out amongst the men, just like the queen's personality standing out amongst a nation of males. There is no instance of overacting or under acting, everyone else did a respectable job.300 is gritty, raw, and isn't afraid to throw body parts and limbs at you. It is not as violent or sadistic as Sin City, but it still can make you look away from the screen in disgust. The blood and guts however is not Sin City-style, but resembling more like Kill Bill Vol. 1's final epic showdown. Most of 300's humor comes from the mere disposing and treatment of bodies that lie all over the place, while the rest of the little bit of comic relief in 300 derives from quick and witty one-liners that occur from time to time. It is indeed action-packed, but does have its hint of sentimentality, especially involving the relationship between the king and queen.Where 300 fails is not the writing, the pacing, the acting, or the content. Instead, it's the green screen usage. It is extremely hard to live up to what Sin City pulled off, but 300 still could have been better visually. The fights were great, but when the action slows down it then becomes rather obvious that a green screen was involved. With Sin City, it was like looking into a living, breathing comic book, and you were totally swept in it. 300 on the other hand has its moments in which the green screen usage overwhelms the scene, best examples includes the characters looking into the background, the scenery. With a green screen, you can only use so much of it before it starts looking a bit fake and/or out of place. Snyder's one flaw comes here, when the viewer is forced to look into the surroundings. Rodriguez had a perfect balance between the subjects and the scenery; Snyder did not. The only other flaw, and it's a minor one, is the treatment of Xerxes; supposed to be menacing, instead comes off as laughable with the make-up and the voice that obviously does not match the actor.Bottom Line: 300 is a good film, and is indeed epic, but do not expect it to sweep you away and change cinema for years to come. Sin City set the bar much too high with green screen usage, and even though 300 is action-packed and is heavy with content; its visual imagery just wasn't consistent enough to really awe anyone. Instead, the awes come from the queen, the fights, and well, the fights. While it is nowhere near as bloody and mind-numbingly violent as Sin City, it still is a film that will attract more men than women, even if there are hundreds of buff men revealing almost all their assets. Flawed, but violently fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

It is adrenaline, testosterone pumping from beginning to end.Gerrad Butler's King Leonidas makes Russell Crowe's Maximus look like a choir boy in comparison! Butler spits out every single line and you buy it all along with his men. David Wenham's narration gives weight to the already heavy images.

If you didn't show up to work on this gig with a 6-pack, ripped chest and bulging shoulders and biceps, you might as well stayed home. This was a graphic novel brought to life in every sense. There is the blood spattering, the extended fighting, the preening, everything that you read a graphic novel for and enjoy is there, now, with motion. Everything is predictable about the film (of course for those that have read the novel) but the uninformed will not be surprised much by the story, but the absolute joy that is in the violence is what gets you amped up.The music by Tyler Bates leads the charge.

"""This is Sparta!""","Zack Snyder's epic spectacle about the Battle of Thermopylae in the fifth century BC, when the Spartan king Leonidas tried to stop the Persian army with three hundred soldiers, does not pretend to historical credibility, but is an adaptation of the comic book of the same name by Frank Miller. The film mimics the comic-book visuals, with an interesting use of colors and contrasts, spectacularly directed fight scenes, and the amount of ""monsters"", violence and gore that surpasses most of the slasher horrors I've seen. The criteria by which films receive R rating are quite puritanical and conservative, and in most cases, the reasons for this rating are ridiculous to me, but with the explicitness of violence and to some extent sex, ""300"" definitely deserves it. But although it has an epic atmosphere and is visually breathtaking, overall it is not particularly strong or impressive. I saw it about a decade ago, and now while watching it again I remembered almost nothing. The story and dialogues occasionally step in unconvincing and even a comic exaggeration, and I think it is too morbid for a story it tells. As a fan of horror and all kinds of twisted movies, it was somewhat suitable for me, but I don't recommend it to a faint-hearted audience and by no means for children.7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Excellent Superficially, but Unfortunately without Depth","The film is a jarring inconsistency of some of the most well chirographed fight scene ever yet filmed, some completely over the top fantasy creaturish humans (in a supposedly historical setting), some flinchingly bad dialog, and really embarrassingly comic book scenes and caricatures.I loved this film, and I hated the guys who screwed it up. This film had truly great potential with a far deeper plot than Braveheart, greater scope and even greater armies than Lord of the Rings.But things were just wrong, the consummating moment for the hero of the story was cut short like it had begun and was instantly edited to the end for no apparent reason. The Introduction to the hero looked like a scene for Jungle Book, it actually had a Wolf with glowing eyes. Much of the dialog looked like it was taken off the back of a patriotic serial box and then just Greekified and repeated with no apparent rhythm, and almost comically the soundtrack seemed to try to beef up every really bad section of dialog with really grand music.This film could have been great instead it's only good; but giving honor to whom it is due. It has what is probably a three minute sword fight complete with about twenty kills done from one camera angle. In terms of filming, it is a triumph like nothing I've ever seen; and in terms of viewing, you've got to see it! So many things in there are still that good that I totally recommend it.

Testosteronicus Maximus Anno Domini,"In about 480 B.C., the actual Battle of Thermopylae was fought in the narrow pass of the same name, which inspired many persons to come after, from military strategists to artisans. In our time, one such person, provocative graphic novelist Frank Miller, was also inspired by the tale, and has in turn inspired director Zack Snyder to produce what must be hailed as two parts art, one part history, and a full seven parts wild, unbridled anarchy.The classic historical event is played out with a good measure of drama; as King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his force of 300 of the legendary Spartan army join with the rest of the Greek forces to hold the pass from the vast forces of Persia, his queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) fights her own battle on the home front, attempting to sanction reinforcements for her noble husband. Both heroes face incredible odds. Butler's Leonidas was not done justice by the film's trailers, which painted a bloodthirsty maniac--the actual portrayal shows a wise and cunning leader, as capable of understanding and forgiveness as he is patriotic and defiant to the enemies of honor and decency who rise against Greece. This of course makes for a fascinating character. Additionally interesting are the characters of the veteran Captain (Vincent Regan), proud to rise to the challenge alongside his son, and Queen Gorgo, willing to do anything to uphold the ideals of her husband, and of all Sparta. There are, of course, wild liberties taken with the account--although debauchery indeed ruled in Persia, and animals may have been larger, they were perhaps not so heavily armored, and King Xerxes, while intimidating, was not twenty feet tall. But, hey, it's art, right? It's a sure thing all of this takes a back seat to the stunning visuals, and the tremendous carnage of the battle scenes. Unless your clan views evisceration as a virtue, consider leaving the kiddies at home. Prepare yourself for a wild ride, with, mind you, the HINT of a history lesson.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

Another problem I have is King Leonidas's (Gerald Butler) occasional sarky comments which don't always fit with the film.Any issues I have with 300 are only minor and don't take away from this film being an epic masterpiece.

It was about time...,"It is apparent that Frank Miller's work, finally got the credit it deserves, now in the 2000s, instead of the poor translations to the screen , in the past decades. So after ""Sin City"", here come ""300"", to blow your mind away.Never mind, ""Troy"", that chick flick, that took the savagest epic poem ever written, to transform it into a Pitt/Bana/Bloom gawk. If you ask my opinion, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", had more in common with ""The Odyssey"", than ""Troy"" had with ""The Iliad""...Never mind, ""Alexander"", that took the story of one of the greatest strategists of all time and his journey, to transform it into a quite perverse parallel to G.W.'s ""fight to civilize""...Here, is a movie, based on a graphic novel, that teaches history lessons, better than anyone else ever did.Thanks to the pen of Frank Miller, the artistry of Zack Snyder, and the vision of them both, this here is a lesson as to how to treat an epic tale. The work that was done here, is amazing. Production design, flawless. The CGI, near perfection and speaking of which, I don't know if the film was shot on location, it would have the same impact as it did now. As, for the actors? Butler IS Leonidas. He simply IS. He exists. You believe him. Everyone else, played their part in perfection and stood by their character, as best as they could.The music of the film, is a mixture of heavy guitars, orchestra and vocals and although it reminds of some other scores, (the rejected score of ""Troy"", work of Basil Poledouris, and perhaps ""Gladiator"") it stands as great as the 300 Spartans themselves.Being Greek, this is the only film in recent memory that makes me being proud of my ancestors and our history. It's an ode to freedom and valor. Values that are forgotten in most of the world today although western civilization keeps referring to them constantly. It's also a reminder that when guns were invented, ""balls"" disappeared...I watched the teaser trailer, once every day since its release. The anticipation couldn't reach a higher level and as is usual in a situation like this, you are always disappointed. Not THIS time. (If you exclude the Spartans' ""HOO-HA"", that is...) I'm not sure i can go to the cinema as many times as I'd like, to enjoy this masterpiece.A big ""Hail"" to Miller, to Snyder, to Butler. I believe, that if I write anything else, I will only diminish the film's value....You know what? Just... go see the film. And if you already have, see it again.I would also like to comment on other peoples um... comments..How it stirs your primal instincts, it true, it does that.How it takes the history and gives it a turn (not always for the best) that is bigger than life, true too. It's a movie. It is supposed to do that.How the Persians were all deformed, mutated, and so on, and Xerxes himself a bit effeminate, ""so they must die"", in this ""Racist"" movie? Not so much. Don't forget they are the BAD GUYS of the film. Do you suppose that if Sauron and his legion of Orcs, were as good-looking as the Elves themselves, LOTR would have the same impact? Countless are the examples in that. STAR WARS, has the deformed Emperor and deformed Darth Vader. In BRAVEHEART, the true villain is Robert the Bruce's father, and he is a leper. The heir to England's throne is gay. In CONAN THE BARBARIAN, Thalsa Doom is a Snake. You want more? It's a movie and bad guys in movies look worse than good guys in movies.Also a comment for the people who parallel this work to G.W's propaganda tools... That was ""Alexander"". As for this film, you are forgetting something crucial, that probably is genetically imprinted on US citizens DNA to forget... The Spartans were DEFENDING their land. Not INVADING somebody else's. So any talk made for freedom, is used in the very accurate and pure form. Not as a manipulative tool for US troops, dudes... US troops, don't defend...And in any case, IT'S ONLY A MOVIE.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
History x Fantasy,"Snyder's epic brilliantly avoids critiques of historical accuracy by meshing fantasy and history together.Following the 300 Spartan soldiers of the ancient battle of Thermopylae, focus lies heavily on the action sequences, shot reminiscent of the panels of the graphic novel they were lifted from. Superbly choreographed to a degree of superhuman skill, violence justifiably plays a key role in plot, whilst well balanced with dashes of democracy shown in an aligned arc to give the story context.Acting is great across the board, with many well-known faces showing up, and without a potentially poor attempt to portray Greek accents.Key events are by and large historically accurate, an accuracy which is held until the likes of the Immortals arrive. From thenceforth fantasy takes rule, providing the excitement from battle to battle. Even then, famous quotes and people are portrayed providing an excellent mix. And as the narration follows the words of someone inspiring soldiers at the next battle, the creative licensing of history is justifiable even more.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Epic has a new name.,"I just came back from the theater and I'm going back at 8:00. This is the most brutally, stunningly beautiful movie to hit theaters in a very very long time, if ever when you consider how it was made. It is pure madness, I could never believe that a movie was going to match my thoughts of ""amazing"" so closely. It exceeded my wildest expectations,and I was very hyped up about this too. The whole movie has a vibe and a style that is unmatched.

"Quite a laugh really. Take it with a pinch of salt, relax and enjoy","Whether you like, enjoy, rate or simply hate 300 depends almost entirely on what you expect. Don't expect history. Apart from the fact that the hero is the Spartan king Leonidas, fetchingly portrayed by a muscle-bound Scotsman in skimpy shorts and a cape, and the film portrays - very loosely - the historical battle of Thermopylae when a tiny Grecian force held a far larger Persian force at bay, this is more fiction than fact. For example, and quite crucially: a lot is made of 'freedom' in 300, that no Spartans will bow to the Persians etc blah, blah. 21st century demotic thought at its finest, paper-thin and millimetre deep. And fair enough: banging the drum about 'freedom' and 'liberty' always goes down well in the freedom and liberty-loving West which values freedom and liberty so much, it is prepared to sacrifice whole nations in the quest to introduce democracy to the world. The speech given by Leonidas's queen to the senate could have been written in the White House four years ago when it desperately tried to justify it invasion of Iraq. More pertinently for Hollywood, of course, a liberal use of the word freedom lends a spurious philosophical glamour to any dross they care to churn out. But inconveniently, Sparta had nothing to do with freedom: only one in five of the inhabitants of Sparta were free men. The rest, or most of them, were Helots, slaves who at a certain time of the year could be killed by any Spartan with impunity. So much for 'freedom'. But as I say, if you are looking for fact, don't bother with 300. If you expect a literary script, again the only sensible advice is to avoid 300. It you are averse to the graphic portrayal of gore, although gore redeemed by being so highly stylised that it is largely unreal, don't bother. If, on the other hand, you are quite entertained by slasher movies, sword and sorcery and all things Tolkienian (does the word exist?), give 300 whirl. Oddly enough I don't like slasher movies, sword and sorcery or all things Tolkienian at all, but as a piece of superior bubblgegum movie-making and movie-watching 300 somehow hits the spot. It is, it has to be said, complete and utter cobblers (and that is not an obscene word, dear American friends). But what I like is that it has no pretensions whatsoever. None at all. It follows in the tradition of Sin City, another film based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, and its scenes (I read) follow the graphic panels of the novel virtually seamlessly. And that is the key to it. 300, like Sin City, is the graphic novel in movie form. Naturally, simply because it is a 'comic' doesn't mean it need not have literary quality but nor does it mean that it should have one either. The dialogue is almost of the 'Me Tarzan, you Jane' school of writing with one or two lines of cod philosophy. But neither is there a necessity that it should have a great script, and to criticise 300 because it doesn't have one misses the point entirely as does taking the film seriously on any intellectual level whatsoever. This is film-making, for goodness sake, money-making, entertainment. Viewed with that in mind and 300 can be forgiven quite a lot. So if it is way, way, way over the top, from the CGI-enhanced muscles of the Spartans and Xerxes, all metal piercing, eyeshadow and chains who is surely a gay icon somewhere to the quite impossible battle scenes, all of whom were so obviously generated on the latest Apple Macs, who cares. Was it a failing of P T Barnum's extravangazas that the elephants couldn't recite Shelley? 300 is way, way, way over the top and unashamedly proudly over the top, almost like the best drag act you have ever seen. As a piece of film-making 300 is not original - Sin City was merely because it got in there first - but in an odd sort of way it is still satisfying. So it doesn't matter that Leonidas sounds as though he is from Paisley in Scotland, or that Xerxes seems to have just arrived from a rich man's fetish party, or that The Immortals, the Persian king's fearsome bodyguard are superbly ridiculous. Who cares. 300 is an outright romp and none the worse for that. Elsewhere you will read, as always that this is either the best film ever made or so bad the director should have been jailed. It's neither. If you agree to it on its own terms, it is rather good. Shakespeare it ain't, but then anyone who has seen Titus Andronicus will know that sometimes Shakespeare wasn't, either.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
I wasn't a big fan. I couldn't take it seriously.,"I thought the film looked pretty. Real pretty. It had the look of a video game. The look of the film is what makes it good in my book. However, other than that, there isn't much else. The film has pretty good acting and a pretty cool story based on the legend of the 300 Spartans versus the Persians. However, the cheesiness of the whole thing got in the way and the film just doesn't really recover from it. The crazy images and the over the top logic just made me almost pee my pants in the theater. It is a hilarious movie. I couldn't stop laughing. It was great. There were closeups of people grunting and growling in some of the weirdest ways. A lot of the characters acted so goofy that it was impossible for me to take them seriously. All of the warriors had six packs and eight packs, even the wicked thin dudes. The two parts that made me laugh the hardest were when the guy is pushed down the conveniently located endless pit, and when Xerxes appeared for the first time or as i like to call him, The Human Chandelier. He had so many ridiculous looking rings in his face that i could barely look at him without cracking up! And his voice!!! He sounded like a robot!!! He was weird looking. And then when that guy appeared with the buzz saws for arms, i just couldn't take it anymore. It was too ridiculous to be good. If you want to see a film that ensures nonstop laughter, I highly recommend 300.",,Anonymous,Action

Excellent Film. We Need More Like it.,"I recently watched this film again (in 2022). I had seen it when it came out and purchased the DVD the day it was released. I remember loving it, but would it hold up after a decade or so? Yes indeed. This movie is amazing. The critics panned it when it came out as visual candy for the simple-minded. But I couldn't disagree more. The film's take on the ancient world is filled with barbaric scenes, but I think it also has a heart that is far better than the usual progressive cynicism we tend to get from most of Hollywood.This is an aspirational film, a movie that reminds us to fight for what we believe in. And as for any historical liberties, I would place 300 in the category of ""Historical Inspiration."" Obviously, you shouldn't be using 300 to write school papers about the Battle of Thermopylae. But I do hope that folks would see films like this one and be sparked to learn more.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
I love it!,"The movie ""300"" has been debated since its release. While some may find the movie entertaining, others argue that it is far from historically accurate. For instance, the movie portrays the battle of Thermopylae as a one-on-one fight rather than a coordinated effort by the Phalanx, which was a crucial aspect of the Spartans' success. The movie also depicts the Persians as flamboyant and grossly exaggerated instead of portraying them accurately.Moreover, the movie glorifies the Spartans, who, in reality, were slave-owning gym enthusiasts and not as heroic as they are portrayed in the movie. In fact, the Greeks, who fought alongside the Spartans, are often overlooked in the movie.While the movie may have shortcomings, it brings attention to the Battle of Thermopylae and the ancient Greek civilization. It is important, however, to remember that the movie is not a historically accurate representation of the events that took place.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Fantastic,"We are watching this film yet again, and loving every minute of it. I saw this in 2006 in a Greek cinema with young Greeks roaring their approval, proud of their heritage. That alone made the experience heart-thumping.I know it is not historically correct, some of the costuming is highly stylised, and more than likely not wholly correct, but don't care. For me it is visually stunning, unutterably beautiful. It is a wonderful assault on the senses, lending empathy with heroic struggle, but above all it is the imagery which stays with you.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
300 is not a 10/10 perfect movie!,"Why did 23 000 people vote a 10 for this movie??As an art form, filmaking deserves better, this is not a perfect movie..Don't get me wrong, as a well done action movie it has high energy and is fast-paced. There are some visually pleasing breakthroughs in film making present such as the use of slow motion and the light filters that give it the surreal appearance of a video game..As a candidate for a perfect 10/10 movie 300 fails immediately because it has a complete disregard for subtlety and modesty, and it communicates only the simple language of our lower animal nature.. This being one of the main reasons I enjoyed it so much! :D But film making as an art form deserves better, and in this case a more well-rounded glimpse into the human psyche for starters.What more can you expect from an action movie? Entertainment is their primary purpose.. Well, Gladiator contained solid character development, a historically accurate storyline as well as a soulful theme opposed to simple cold, hard action.Personally, the following flaws disrupted my viewing pleasure: --the slow-mo editing at times being poorly done --the acting at times --the lack of story and character developmentEven when evaluated as a well done action movie it is far from perfect..

It's new, fresh and based on real facts that you can look up. Leonidas and his men actually did exist, they weren't exactly 300, more likely 1000 and killed over 20000 Persians. See this movie for the visual effects, not for the scenario or historical facts.

"I Loved, but I understand","This has to be one of my favorite movies. I am a historical nerd and I know (probably better than most) the inaccuracies of this movie. The phalanx was wrong, the Spartan's wore armor, the Persian Immortals were not zombie-oid. It is highly unlikely that there were elephants, and impossible for there to be rhinos. Xerses didn't believe he was a god, however he was the semi-divine servant of God, etc. etc. However this movie as a whole blew me away. I understood when I saw this movie that it was not meant to be die hard historical accurate (though I am happy they didn't put big S on their shields as I saw some moron do), it was not meant to be fascist racism (though I can understand sort of how you got that idea from). This movie was above all a movie of glory and self sacrifice. It also gave a very good detail about everyday life in Lakonia (except for the Ephors bit). People have given arguments that there are some over macho lines in this movie. And I say, ya but that's how they talked. The Spartan's invented the form of speech referred to as laconic, meaning to give short pointed, often aggressive, responses. The fight in the shade, birth to real men, Persians come and get them, those were all really said by the Spartans. For inaccuracies yes I can understand how it may annoy some people, but this was not about making a documentary on the battle. This movie was about making a legend. It is told in Dilios view to embellish. It was trying to make 300 a version of Greek Mythology, as powerful as the exploits of Herakles. Calling this movie racist is the equivalent of calling The Ten Commandments anti-Egyptian, they just happen to be the enemy of the story, as the Persians are now. Should this movie have come out during a war in Iraq, I will admit probably not. However I'm not here to grade the movie on the politics of the time, but the quality of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
A Moving Epic!,"I rally liked 300. I should have seen this film when it came out in theaters. Almost 2 years later that I finally got the chance to see it. There is no need to describe the plot unless you did not pay attention in your history class. It's about 300 Spartan soldiers led by King Leonidas taking on King Xerxes and his 100,000 soldiers. It is no mystery what happens to the Spartans. I liked this move very much. The style of filming is much different than I am used to seeing. The tone is dark and there is basically war scenes with little romance along the side. The story is moving because the 300 men died for their country, died to stop the Persians from invading Sparta and having their loved ones used as slaves. The acting is great. I don't expect much out of Gerard Butler but he did awesome in this movie. This film is very gory and blood is seen many times so if you don't like blood, beware. I rate this movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
A striking visual feast and stunning audio experience...,"No, I wasn't expecting ""depth"" to the characters nor was I expecting to see a documentary about the famous battle at Thermopylae--and perhaps that's why I can happily state that I was caught up in the frenzy and excitement and visual splendor of 300 from the opening scene to the touching ending.King Leonidas (brilliant performance by GERARD BUTLER), is the Spartan King who must send his brave warriors to fight the huge Persian army. Butler is certainly not one-dimensional in the role, which is what would have happened in the hands of a less talented actor. He found many facets that humanize this ferocious King with an appetite for battle and he makes the most of his every moment on screen. The eye is drawn to him like a magnet, even in group scenes where his commanding presence dominates the action or the talk. Snyder certainly lucked out in finding exactly the right man for the role. In many close-ups he reminds me of the classic screen star ROBERT TAYLOR (think ""Ivanhoe"").And others around him are fine too. LEONA HEADEY makes an interesting, spirited Spartan Queen, with a beautiful face and a lovely commanding presence of her own. She's especially good in her scenes with the conniving DOMINIC WEST, as the two argue over sending a larger army against the Persian hordes. Their final confrontation is a shocker.Visually, the film is an artistic achievement that makes stunning use of the CGI and blending it with the studio shots in a way that resembles murals and famous works of art. This is one aspect of the film that is easily guaranteed to earn Oscar nominations in technical categories.Butler's command of the screen is more evident here than in any other film to date, including his work in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. No doubt this will be an iconic role for him.Only drawback, at least in the theater I attended, is the sound mix of music and dialog could have been improved to the point where the spoken words are not drowned out by the relentless (but fascinating) background score, which tends to milk every melodramatic moment to the max.The battle scenes are well staged and I never found the use of slow motion distracting or inappropriate. Snyder has done a fantastic job.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Simply Put....WOW,"I have been waiting for this film for some time now, and i was so hyped up for this movie that when the trailers started rolling, i feared that i would be let down, but in actual fact...i wasn't at all.Having watched Troy, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven and bits of Alexander the battle scenes, yes they are impressive, but they are short and appeared to lack a certain edge to it, enter 300 due to this being shot in blue screen Zack Snyder had the freedom to create pretty much anything he wants, and he did, and it certainly paid off.Also with the films mentioned above, there appeared to be such a long time between battles that i sometimes felt bored (less with the exception of Gladiator) but with Alexander, it was like 3 hours long and dragged like it was a 5 hour film, this film didn't, although when it veered away from the battles, i was so pumped up from them that i was on the edge of my seat wanting more of what was just on the screen.i do hope though that they don't make too many movies like this, as it would take the effect away and just make it an average film, which i hope is what people don't want.there is talk about this film being Butlers Big Break, i do hope it does to him what Layer Cake did for Daniele Craig..i was walking down the road hoping someone would confront me just so i could kick them in the chest and say THIS IS SPARTA!!!!

"Russell Crowe and ""Gladiator"" - move over!!!","In my opinion the most recent movies of this kind don't live up to expectations. 2004's epics ""Alexander"" and ""Troy"", and 2005's ""Kingdom of Heaven"", were all serviceable but fell short of being great films. In the recently released epic ""300"", that trend came to a screeching halt. This movie is unlike anything I have ever seen. Although the scenery is obviously computer generated, it is simply breathtaking. Some fans may argue that it looks like a Playstation game, but that only makes it that much more unique and enjoyable . The acting, cinematography, the music, the wardrobe, etc., were all done with precision and style unsurpassed by even ""Lord of the Rings""! Although the battle scenes are more violent than anything I have ever seen on film, they are highly stylized and graceful, as in an opera setting, sometimes shown in slow motion. This technique, however, does not hamper the special effects at all. Gerard Butler, who plays King Leonidas, commands the screen with the same presence that has made an international superstar of Russell Crowe, a fellow actor who also excels in captivating audiences with his awareness on stage. Butler's performance as Leonidas is reminiscent of the aforementioned's role as Maximus, in the also superb epic ""Gladiator"". Although I do recall Butler's exceptional performance as the phantom in 2004's ""Phantom of the Opera"", nothing would have prepared me for his role as King Leonidas, which has surely catapulted him into the upper echelon of first rate actors in this era. He has to be considered an early odds on favorite to receive a Best Actor Oscar in next years Academy Awards. King Leonidas, the Greek leader and general of a group of soldiers called Spartans, takes on a Persian army of thousands(who want to rule the world)in an effort to remain free as men and as a Country. His dignity, swagger, perilous conviction, and unmatched skill make him a formidable foe for any army. The problem however, is that his army consists of only 300 men, thus the title ""300"". Although they are grossly outnumbered, these Spartans are highly skilled in the art of killing and quite vicious by nature. Take no prisoners and have no mercy is their pledge. Lena Heady, who stars as Leonidas's wife, Queen Gorgo, is quite convincing as a strong willed woman, who will stand by her King to the end, under any circumstances. David Wenham as Dilios, Dominic West as Theron, and Vincent Regan as Captain, are all stunning as fellow Spartans. Rodrigo Santoro, relatively unknown, is striking as Persian King Xerxes, a giant among men. Some patrons of the genre may be put off by the presence of mythical beasts and unworldly creatures included in the film, but that is partly what sets this movie apart from all others. Unlike ""Lord of the Rings"", it is based on a true event, but like the comic book that it is adapted from, it is reinvented from the the vivid imaginations of Frank Miller(the comic book's author), and Zack Snyder(the director). With ""300"", along with 2004's ""Dawn of the Dead"", Mr. Snyder has become a director not to be taken lightly. Anyone who doesn't like ""300"" doesn't like movies. My only problem with ""300"" is the running time, at only 117 minutes, it should have been closer to 3 hours in length. After all, it is an epic.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

So how can we be concerned for the good guys or care about the pending outcome of the ferocious battle?! The reason I'm giving the film 4 stars is down to the technicalities of the film making, the movie is certainly beautiful to watch and the green screen is extremely well done (very much like Sin City) The battle scenes of which there are many are also impressive and deserves recognition, but other than that I can't take much else positive from the movie. The storytelling was poorly done, the direction was OK at best, acting was adequate and so on.

Many writers wish their books were adapted likewise,"First, 300 is based on a comic book by Frank Miller (Robocop 2), inspired in the battle of Thermopylae. So don't even bother seeing it, if comic book violence, action over character, style over substance, fantasy over realism is your thing. Second, this movie captures the very essence of the comic book, frame by frame and word by word. Sounds familiar? Maybe because Robert Rodriguez already did it in 2005's Sin City, based on a comic book by, guess who? Frank Miller. Other comic book artist in the vein of Miller have seen their work butchered on the screen. Example is Allan Moore, whose comic books have spawned a bunch of mediocre movies (V for Vendetta, From Hell, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen). But Frank comic books are perfect for the screen. The stylish frames are the perfect storyboard. The characters over the top, the wardrobe iconic and visually arresting. Of course, Spartans didn't go to war wearing tongs and red capes, but the symbolism of it, godlike bodies almost nude, tells you about the characters more than any words. The same with the mangled, ugly bad guys, visually altered to give maximum impact. His words are simplistic, but piercing, and like the medium, macho as hell (""Spartan, come back with your shield, or on it.""), that's why you can do a script by simply copy/paste-ing exactly what you read in the comic book. It's the perfect blueprint for an action movie. Snyder knew all this and took every artistic license possible to do this movie like a comic book. He used tricks done by Rodriguez before, only that Rodriguez relying on star power distracted me from the stories in Sin City, also Sin City's pace was not enough to savour each story: Sin City tells 3 stories from 3 books as long as 300 in the same space of time. A lot of people will look at this movie looking for other entertainment tricks used more in regular films. This is looking back. The great thing about 300 is that freshens up the tired sword-and-sandal genre. It's a very welcome update and one of the best films of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Spectacular,"300 ‚Äì CATCH IT (A) 300 is a trend setter which not only introduced a new technology but took the gore and violence to next level. I saw 300 when it was released in bits and pieces but now finally got the chance to watch the complete movie from start to finish. Well I've to say I was blown away it was indeed something spectacular and even after 6 years still no one has done anything like it. Even though Spartacus TV show does have managed to capture the essence in its budget. Gerard butler, Michael Fassbender, Lena Heady, Tom Wisdom, Dominic West and Rodrigo Santoro did a fantastic job. The main hero of the movie was defiantly Zack Zynder & graphic designers. They created a new world for us just like Star Wars, Jurassic Park or Avatar. Now I simply cannot wait for 300: Battle of Artemisia with Sullivan Stapleton, Evan Green and Rodrigo Santoro reprising as Xerxes.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

Movie Review: 300,"You will not enjoy this. 300 the movie that is. If you hate battles, bloodshed, nudity, gore, and especially if you are of Persian ancestry, I urge you to stay away from the movie. This is no enmity to get into.But if you are willing to walk into the theatre with unclouded eyes, then by all means buy that ticket, sit really tight and enjoy the visually stunning film.""300"" is the adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel and directed by the talented Zack Snyder.The story is about an ancient battle that took place in Thermopylae where King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans warrior battled in glory and honour.Their enemy is an invading army led by the self-proclaimed ""King of Kings"", Xerxes. His army is as numerous as it is insurmountable.Courage is an understatement for the Spartans.By impression to be all violent and gore, the movie is actually elemental in humanity and beauty. It is story telling of enormous captivity, trilling and emotional. This film is highly graphic with its amount of details in every scene. CGI aside, notice the colours that were used to paint every mood. Admire the camera angles that dynamically transform the idea on screen. Do grasp tightly for the tension is compelling.Greed, deceit, betrayal¬Ö Arrogance, imprudence, valiant¬Ö Slavery, mystic, lust and moreHumanity is raw, beastly and loving.Think not towards that this film as brainless fighting, making blood spills and amputations its entertainment. Think towards an idea of mythology, fantasy, the ethos of graphic novels being skillfully crafted by its makers. This film is not for the weak but for the brave.Notice the minimal descriptive leads of the ""300"" story in this writing. The concept of ""300"" is simple, but the execution is perfection. And much saved for your viewing pleasure, if you dare.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
300 Chip'N'Dales,"Now, there are 11 male models playing football (or soccer) for team Italy, so why not get some 300 roaring Chip'N'Dales and cast them for pretentious peace of art with excellent Hollywood marketing. Exactly, it sells. Every 4th grader will p*ss boiling water just to see how 300 brave men kicked zillions of Asian a** (no offence here, but that's what my history book was saying back in early 90s). Yeah, tons of blood, funny freak show all around the place, some gay with a funny voice (no offence again) called Xerox, or whatever. Lame try to make it epic, lame dialogues, lame plot. Actors did they job. They kicked each other's a**. History was swallowed. Spartans were portrayed as some sick drugged bastards. So were Persians. Ill imagination. That's the only thing I can say. If these are the new standards, well, thanks but no thanks. Positive point - some places were so stupid it made them funny.Some were quick enough to label this movie ""epic"". No way.

Pretentious Claptrap,"I downloaded this film to my DVR recently knowing nothing about it except that it was claimed to be an adventure movie centering on the Greek's defeat at the hands of the Persians at the battle of Thermopylae. Or so I thought.Having grown up on the sword and sandal movies of the 1950s and 1960s I figured it could be an enjoyable 120 minutes or so of entertaining adventure.As the film unrolled it seemed awfully familiar. Baby born, stands around in snow, fights someone in a courtyard, defeats a beast up in the mountains. Why did I think I had seen this before? Penny drops, so to speak. ""Meet the Spartans.""I honestly had no idea at all that ""Meet the Spartans"" was a send-up, tribute (mockery?) of ""300."" I had never heard of ""300"" in any form, movie or comic book, before watching it, though I can see now that it provides ample material for lampooning.Having seen them both I can now recommend that one stick with ""Meet the Spartans."" Its humor may be sophomoric, and even that's giving it the benefit of the doubt, but at least it is entertaining and provides some good belly laughs along the way. ""300"" on the other hand is one of the most pretentious, god-awful pieces of claptrap that I've seen in many years.The actors look like a combination of escapees from a gay porn video combined with Brooklyn hipsters. The whole slow motion thing gets old very quickly. Some reviews I scanned mentioned people being upset at the ""politics"" of the film. Unless you're a reincarnated Spartan upset at how your city is portrayed I can't see how ""politics"" even enters into it. It would be like complaining about the ""politics"" in an Ed Wood opus (speaking of something else that's more entertaining).Do yourself a favor and give this a wide berth.",,Anonymous,Action
"""300"" - Zack Snyder delivers!","And so does Scottish born actor - Gerard Butler as King Leonidis.
Who can forget his full throated: ""This is Sparta!"" In his deep voice.I've also seen the first version, from the 50's (and there have been a few since) of the glorious Spartans who held up a million man Greek army led by
the cruel King Xerxes, and pay the ultimate price, while the cowardly
politicians scheme and squabble. Nothing seems to change.Biggest difference between the 50's version and this, the latest, is the semi-cartoon colored scenes, with many slow-mo moves during fights. (Zack also employed this technique in 2019's Wonder Woman.) Unbelievable beasts and disformed creatures abound.Bottom line? IF you like non-stop action and a topless Lena Headey
(Sparta's Queen Gorga) - then this movie is for you, and never forget Gerald Butler; IMO, he made the movie. Worth a watch. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Zack Snyder's brilliant vision,"It's 480 BC and the Greek city states are faced with a massive invading Persian army. The Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and a force of 300 men march to the Hot Gates at Thermopylae to face King Xerxes and his army. The cliff narrows to a small opening to negate Xerxes' numerical advantage. They would hold the pass until they are betrayed.This is all about director Zack Snyder's vision to adapt this Frank Miller graphic novel. It is a cinematic full screen representation of a comic book. He's taken the beauty and essence of a 2-dimensional artform onto the big screen. He has taken the successful 'Sin City' style to the next level.The story is fairly basic. It's a lot of machismo and lots of abs. Gerard Butler holds the movie together in a thankless job in this visual vortex. The dialog can be very stilted, but it fits the story well.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Okay but not great,"The hype will kill this film far more effectively than it's quality. It can't live up to it. Is it a bad film? No. Is it a great film? No. It's a good one with some big problems. The first is the script, which is TOO close to Frank Miller to work. You notice how shonky the plotting is, how laughable the dialogue is the moment it is read out aloud. Or in Butler's case, shouted at the top of his lungs. There are no characters, just poses. No-one to root for, no-one to boo. So you're left with the action and the look of the film.The action is pretty good at first but not quite the great you hope for from the trailer. It's like everything is geared so closely to looking like the comic book that they forgot that means a lot of slowed-down or static shots that get a bit boring. Even more boring is the look of the film. Every shot in the film is washed out and rusty and that gets tired very, very fast. Apart from blood red in the battles that's all you get and you really long for something different just to break it up. It's the most boring use of colour in years. Taken with the animating out of many of the actor's features to touch them up to look more like cartoons it just blands everything out. Even when the singing goat turns up in Xerxes tent it looks a bit ordinary and samey.So, some good battles but it never flies because everything looks the same and you don't care about anything or anyone that happens. On the Arnie scale, with Terminator being the tops, Total Recall being great, T3 being okay, Raw Deal being weak and Red Sonja being the pits, I'd give this a T3.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Setting the bar,"300 came out of nowhere and captivated many at the time of its release . Catching everyone who stood in its path off guard and making a significant dent in cinematography. Gerard butler plays his best role in my opinion as the king Leonidas. With is army of 299 soldiers looking to defeat the hundred thousand plus army of Persians, they do it in style with badass slow motion style matrix . If you have not seen the movie 300 I suggest you get on the bandwagon . If you're a huge fan watch the sequel but the original is much better . I give this a solid 8 out of 10 stars . It's a cinema masterpiece from beginning to end . Never a dull moment in the runtime . This movie is up there on the list of my favorite action movies and the only new age action movie to come close to this is John wick . Michael fassbender is also very good in the movie as well .",8.0,Anonymous,Action

I was also surprised that so many people think this movie isn't accurate. Are you seriously trying to tell me that the Spartans weren't really betrayed by Gollum's brother in real life? Are you really trying to say, that in real life, the Persian army was comprised of men and not demons? The Persians didn't really have a goat smoking a hookah in their tent? And come on, the Spartans didn't really consult a floating naked chick before going to war? Xerxes wasn't really a Goa'uld? I find that hard to believe.... Obviously, this movie was totally realistic. It's like they took a time machine & actually filmed the real battle....",7.0,Anonymous,Action

No epic film but uncompromising fighting!,"I saw the movie at the Berlinale Film Festival! I was very eager to see it, as I loved Sin City (the movie), loved the trailer (of course the one with Nine Inch Nails's song as soundtrack!), and was pretty impressed by the epic graphic novel. But could the movie really be as fast, strong and straightforward as expected?With regard to Troy or Gladiator, I would actually just compare the fighting scenes. They are absolutely gripping! The dynamic between slow motion, angle change and frame-dropping is amazing! Most of the blood seemed to be CGI, but that fits in perfectly with all the other CGI. For example, all the background images should be CGI as well, since the same technique (or at least a very similar one) was used as for Sin City. But whereas Sin City was very dark and almost had no need for any background at all, it is crucial for 300!Unfortunately, I can't really say if 300's backgrounds are too comicesque flat or if it is too obvious, that because of the technique the sets couldn't be as huge and realistic as in Troy or Gladiator; perhaps it could also be the lack of different 'sets' or just the adapted story itself... but somehow, I wouldn't call 300 an epic film. An epic film should be of breadth, depth, change and straight narration, in both visually and literary.Also, as far as I noticed, the movie, in contradistinction to the trailer, contains no songs from Nine Inch Nails. However, the soundtrack wasn't too conventional, too, but a love theme is something you probably wouldn't think of too much after reading the graphic novel. Well, Leonidas in the movie is definitely not quite as self-righteous as he is in the novel.To sum it up: The pace is rather stumbling, not really smooth nor fast as it seemed in the trailer, and the script is not as straightforward nor stubborn as the original novel... but at least, 300 definitely contains strong, uncompromising fighting scenes!",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Magnificent, graceful and extremely bloody.","Overall it was magnificent, graceful and extremely bloody. I have to say, some of the best flesh penetrating effects I've seen. The puncturing of the flesh, the spearing of bodies, it was very realistic. Of course someone needed to tell the effects guys to put some blood on the blades of the swords of the Spartans during the bloodiest of scenes. It was amusing to see them slaughter Persian after Persian and have clean swords after piercing and slicing thru flesh. The film was highly detailed in costumes, props and wounds. Images up close were clear as crystal, yet the background was always soft, blurred and colorful. A few scenes where we see the main character of King Leonidas standing overlooking the ocean, or the battleground before him, we'd just see his back, but it looked as if we were seeing the rear of SUPERMAN. I guess it was the dark black hair and the red cape, but it was symbolic in the fact that Leonidas was in fact a ""Superman"" to his troops and in the eyes of the enemy. The scene of young Leonidas and the wolf was just one the coolest and most snarling beast vs man confrontations I've seen on the big screen. Overall, the film was non-stop action and it seemed almost too short. I was as thirsty for 20 more minutes as the Spartans were thirsty for 20 more Persians to conquer. Larry Fong and his 3 camera side by side Cinematography made the fight scenes flawless and so much more fun to watch. The dark overtones mixed with rich color really brought out the comic book feel that Frank Miller intended when he drew it, but to see it on the big screen was a real treat. It's will be well worth the money to see this again on the big screen and I cant wait to be blown away catching it on IMAX too.",,Anonymous,Action
"Brilliant, loved it!","This film style and story telling I personally love, the story of the three hundred is both true and a legend steeped in mythos . This film perfectly captures story telling of an event that though based in history is told in a way that is intentionally over the top through a narrator being one of the characters from the events of the story. The film style of Zack Synder taken from the illustrations of Frank Miller is absent of any modern tokenism or allegory its just a fantastic tale with great set pieces and lighting. Gerald Butler, though Scottish does appear to pull off the both the appearance and character of King Leonidas with great presence in my opinion. As for people complaining about the truth of the story or portrayal of the Persians, I personally don't care the story is not a documentary it is a piece of theatre hammed up to entertain those who wish to listen, just as stories were told in the past.

Art on a wide canvas,"300 is not an historical film, as we understand and define it. It is, for the lack of a better definition, a super-realistic (as in beyond surreal) vision over an historical fact that is in no small way vital to our western identity and culture. Like an art photograph, or a portrait, it attempts to distil the emotions and broad canvas of a time and place. And in it succeeds far beyond what I thought possible from an adaptation of Frank Miller's comic book (or, if you wish, graphic novel). I am a lover of history, and have studied for quite a while ancient Greece, and, as a personal favorite, the Battle of the Thermopylae. Anyone that approaches 300 on hopes of historical accuracy will be sorely disappointed, as almost nothing fits. But one who approaches it from that angle does so in utter ignorance, against all that has been written, promised and otherwise mentioned about it. I must have seen this movie, on my computer, more times than any other movie that I can remember, and always with the pleasure of immersion not on a different time and place, but on a gripping story well told, where 21st century technology meets old campfire story telling. As for Iranians or others feeling offended by it¬Ö any old story is bound to leave someone offended, if offense is what you constantly seek in this world.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

Not for men only,"So far, I've seen this movie twice on IMAX -- two days in a row. I looked around and I definitely felt outnumbered! I was one of a handful of women in the theater. I think the two men sitting near me couldn't figure me out and why I was there alone on Friday afternoon. I told them, hey I'm a Gerry Butler fan and the movie is full of half naked men, what's not to like? I have been waiting for this movie for two years, and it is Zack Snyder's masterpiece! It is simply visually stunning. I just wanted the experience to wash over me. Every frame was like a beautiful oil painting. The violence didn't bother me. I'm not one to seek out slasher films (or zombie films, but I did enjoy Zack's Dawn of the Dead), but I like Gladiator and films like it. It's like Debbie Snyder characterized it -- a ballet of death. It's all so over the top and beautiful that it's nothing like the horror of a war movie like Saving Private Ryan. The severed limbs and decapitations -- Seems strange to say, but it's weirdly beautiful. You just sit there with your mouth open in admiration at the way Zack filmed this. I love, love, love his filming technique for the battle sequences. So many films -- think Gladiator here -- just make it a choppy viewpoint of a man in the battle maelstrom. You're sharing in the confusion of the battle participants and you have no idea how the battle is going -- it's just all chaos. THIS movie was not like that. I loved how the alternating speed up, slow mo had you appreciating each movement. It wasn't just a crowd of guys banging around.I couldn't help thinking about the words of some of the negative reviews. So I asked myself, is this dialog cheesy and trite? I didn't have that reaction -- I just ate it all up. It's like nothing you've ever seen before, and I don't really expect an action movie to have the deepest plot. Some people said the plot was too thin, but really, what else would have been added to have MORE? I think more background would have dragged down the story and the impact of it all. It's tight, concise and packs the punch promised in the trailer. Does Gerry's journey have less Gravitas than Crowe's Maximus? Maybe Crowe had more to work with for an emotional body blow to the audience, but I still enjoyed the ride Zack took me on. Contrast this to drivel like Fantastic Four. If you're going to do a comic book movie, do the damn thing RIGHT! And that's just what Zack did. Even the ending credits were beautiful graphic art. You gotta love a movie that credits ""Transexual Asian"" numbers 1, 2 and three! lol!Gerry Butler was absolutely amazing! He had the mantle of a king always, and it was totally believable that those men would follow him to their death. I have to thank Zack for that moonlit shot and the love scene. That was probably mostly for us women, and we thank you most sincerely!! Very tastefully done. I feel like most R rated films that have love scenes are all about giving eye candy to the men in the audience, but I felt like you gave all genders a little gift there.All the actors were great, and having seen Lena Headey in much lighter fare before, I was quite impressed with her regal performance here. Rodrigo Santoro was so different than most of his previous movies. Loved his menacing presence. Michael Fassbender as Stelios really stood out for me as well. He got some of the best lines of the film, ""We will fight in the shade"", etc. but his wicked grin looking forward to his beautiful death is something I won't soon forget.I've been a Gerry Butler fan for years, but now I am a die-hard Zack Snyder fan. I can't wait to see his upcoming films. He has the eye of a true artist.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
""" The   Irresistible  force  . . . . . against the Immovable object ""","The story of the three hundred Spartans is not the oldest legend originating from Greece, but it is the most famous. Although, Hollywood already had one version in 1962, it's but a shadow of, "" 300 "". Seeing the original and then watching this update, viewers will immediately see the difference. The first is candy coated and offered to entertain audiences holding a box of popcorn. This movie with it's spectacular visual panorama, violent action scenes and overall dramatic effects, will cause you to hold your breath. Gerard Butler, is impressive as King Leonidas. Dominic West as Theron and Vincent Regan as the Captain. Rodrigo Santoro is Xerxes, in modern gang attire and jewelry. This film may have originated in comic pages, but it explodes on the silver screen as iconic art. This version is sure to inspire some to visit the site of the heroic last stand, but may also inspire others to delve into the history books. On that note, there are minor historical mistakes, such as the Spartan king demeaning the Atheans as boy-lovers (which law allowed) but in fact, it was Spartan culture which habitually practice pederasty. Another literary goof, was the use of War-rhinos, elephants and mutants. One in particular which bothered me was the Greek traitor 'Ephialtes' as having been deformed. No historical reference to that. The idea of single Spartan fathers training their sons individually goes against traditional schooling in military academies. One last criticism. The Spartans claimed they fought for freedom and stated the Persian king was a tyrant. Any history book on Sparta, will illuminate the fact, Sparta used Helots as Slaves. Nevertheless, if you don't mind, these and a few other inaccuracies, the film will astonish you with its movie magic and I predict, will imprint itself as a Classic. *****",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Stylized, adrenaline-filled awesomeness","Given that this was made so soon after Sin City, one cannot deny the possibility that a reason for making it was the popularity and widespread success of the aforementioned film. Both are based on comics of Frank Miller's... both are bloody, and packed with adrenaline and style. However, regardless of what may or may not have been in the minds of the producers, this movie is entertaining and fulfilling. Whilst not as well-rounded and perfectly executed as Sin City, it has plenty of action, cool shots and intensity to go around. I have not read the original comic book, so I cannot comment on how well this tells the story that Miller(*not* the historians; don't make the mistake of confusing this film for an actual account of events!) intended, but I can say that it pulls off the comic book feel pretty darn well. The visuals are simply stunning, and the movie is filled, just about to the very brink, with gorgeous designs and camera-work that amazes. The many boxes of text found in most comic books are translated to the medium of film with a narrator, and it works remarkably well. I was worried early on that the narrator would remain for all of the film... but I found it to not only mesh with the visuals but improve the overall experience. The music is part orchestrated score, and all fits exceptionally well. The pacing was flawless. The acting I found to be masterful for just about every part. The dialog varies, but the majority is good. The grandiose speeches and the serious tone of them is lightened pleasantly through occasional wit. The battles are massive, bad-ass and often quite bloody(though there was less gore than I had expected... but I didn't mind). I would guess that big parts of the audience are comprised of people coming mainly for the battles, and I would say that most will leave the theater satisfied. The sequences of fighting are long, stylized, well-choreographed and wickedly cool. I found the rest of the movie to be interesting and engaging, and I wouldn't say that the fights are too long. One thing I really liked, and that got the movie and Frank Miller my respect, was the way the Spartan women were depicted: Strong, passionate and as full of courage and fortitude as the men. Whether or not this is historically accurate, I don't know, but that Miller and the movie would depict women that way is something I can only support and encourage. The movie was not perfect, however; some shots were less spectacular than they could or should have been, and the last battle was perhaps a little disappointing. Still, this is a movie that I urge anyone who enjoys action, macho-ism and comic book style to watch. I strongly recommend this to any fan of comic books and any man into action. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"History, comic book style!","It was obvious after the success of Sin City that we were going to see more of Frank Miller's graphic novels adapted for the screen, and someone was obviously impressed enough with Zack Snyder's visuals on the dire Dawn of the Dead remake to give him the directing reigns. I have to say, I'm not the biggest fan of period epics; but I knew that wouldn't be a problem going into this film as Frank Miller obviously has a very over the top style, and as soon as I heard that it's ""very gory"", I was sold. I have to say that this film is not as great as Sin City; the visuals aren't as good, the film isn't handled as well and the central plot thread isn't as interesting as Sin City's three narratives; but 300 is still a spectacular piece of cinema. The film focuses on the war between the Spartans and the Persians in 480 B.C. A group of 300 Spartans, lead by the fearless King Leonidas, moves in on the advancing Persian army. The warriors are massively outnumbered, but thanks to their impregnable strategy; the few manage to out fight the many for a short time.I haven't read Frank Miller's graphic novel, but I'm guessing that certain sequences were based on it pretty much frame for frame. While this is good in some ways as it allows Snyder to capture the comic book style, in other ways it's very bad as some shots look completely out of place, and make it seem like Snyder doesn't really know what he's doing. There's no problem with post-production, however, as the cinematography is excellent and the way that the fight scenes are shot is good in that it allows them to be completely brutal, while never becoming completely exploitative. I read in British newspaper 'The Sun' that 300 is 'the bloodiest movie in history', which of course isn't the case. There is a lot bloodshed, but it never really FEELS like there's a lot of bloodshed as the atmosphere is completely other-worldly. The way that Snyder uses his actors is good as the impressive Spartans add to the overall look of the film. The two central performances - those coming from Gerard Butler and the beautiful Lena Headey are both impressive, while the largely British support cast impress in their roles. Overall, this isn't a brilliant film as there are a lot of niggles; but it has it's moments, and during the fight scenes (which, thankfully, take up a large proportion of the film), you won't care about 300's shortfalls.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Made for the Big Screen,"I kick myself frequently for missing Frank Miller's Sin City on the big screen. I wish they would bring films like that back occasionally.Well, I wasn't going to miss this one and I am glad I didn't. It was a beautiful and impressive film. It was no Sin City, but it was an enjoyable way to spend two hours on a Saturday morning.One is tempted to start reading something into the film. Maybe an allegory about freedom fighters sacrificing their lives against an imperialist machine with their coalition of the bought and paid for and impressive and fearsome weapons, but I will not get drawn into that. I will say that the story of the Spartans at Thermopylae was as exciting as the story of William Wallace in Braveheart.The scenes with the Oracle were stunning and sensuous and one wants to see more of Kelly Craig. The dialog was typical Hoo Rah and seriously detracted from my enjoyment. I really didn't think the blood and gore was anything you wouldn't find in a video game rated M.

Having the feel of the epic ""Braveheart"" (but not excelling to the greatness of that modern day classic), I did enjoy the film for what it was. Of course they will be some tools who use the film to promote a given agenda, be it liberal or conservative. (but such is the case with any film touching on the subject of war of any kind). Try to ignore those conversations as both sides are looking too deeply in a movie this shallow. Perhaps the film would have been better if they played it a little more straight and nixed the elements that bring the film into the fantasy realm, however Gerarld Butler pretty much nailed the role of King Leonidas (grossly glaring inaccuracies aside) and Director Zack Snyder, who's already accomplished the impossible by making a horror remake that was not only watchable, but able to stand on it's own merits, has another winning film to add to his short but not insubstantial resume.My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Action
blown completely away,"After much breathless anticipation ""300"" finally arrived at my tiny town's theater. My best friend and I went to see it and we were completely blown away. I'd been waiting for it since the very first preview because I am a huge Gerard Butler fan, and I was in no way let down. Most movies like this don't live up to the hype, but this did. Aside from the moving performances and the spectacular effects and filming, the story itself is an amazing one. Never giving up in the face of adversity; risking your life for something you believe in; protecting the innocent. I can't wait to see what Frank comes up with next!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Gird Your Loins, Men!","It's amazing to me that ""300"" is being taken seriously enough to stir up so much controversy. Some say it's homoerotic, others that it's homophobic. Some say it's an indictment of the Bush Administration's attitudes about war, others that it's a right-wing, pro-war diatribe. Iranians are apparently offended by the portrayal of Persians in the film. There are at least three reasons that all of these people need to chill out about this movie: 1.) It's based on a graphic novel, and when was the last time we expected subtlety, realism or political correctness from a graphic novel? 2.) Since it's a virtual recreation of a previously existing graphic novel, the blame for its offensiveness should rest on Frank Miller, not the film. 3.) The movie isn't nearly intelligent enough or important enough to be offended by.""300"" is one long, witless, sustained shout of a movie. Sadly, the filmmakers take their purpose very seriously, so this has none of the knowing humour or kitsch value of ""Sin City,"" the 2005 masterpiece that also recreated a Frank Miller world on the big screen. The creators of ""300"" seem to think they have an important story to tell, and they tell it with deadly earnestness. Therefore, every single line of dialogue, every gesture, every sound effect, is pitched at the same over-emphatic level, with the results being a poundingly monotonous movie.After all the talk of the striking visual style, ""300"" ended up not being stylized enough for my taste. ""Sin City"" truly created a whole other world on screen; realism was not only ignored -- it was completely shunned. In ""300,"" the artists try to create a realistic universe for their characters to move and fight in, so what we basically get in the end is an imitation of films like ""Gladiator"" and ""Troy,"" with even less brains.Not surprisingly, the movie is at its best when it's fighting. There are a couple of dazzling sequences, like the one in which our feisty band of Spartans sends a horde of Persians hurtling over a cliff; or a montage that shows an extended series of battles including charging rhinos and elephants. But any time it slows down for plot exposition or scenes of dialogue, you might as well hit snooze, because you're not going to miss anything important. None of the actors really makes much impression, though they probably deserve credit for even doing as well as they do, considering they had nothing but blue screens to interact with. Gerard Butler is o.k. as King Leonidas, but his mush-mouthed line delivery was a constant distraction. Rodrigo Santoro gets stuck with a humiliating role as Xerxes, king of the Persians. The costume designer bedecks him in jewels and piercings, and the sound team give him an electronically fake voice that sounds ridiculous coming from such a fruit loop of a character. But no matter. The only thing you really notice about any of the actors are their sculpted abs and pecs, which are on constant and prominent display. Indeed, by the end of the film, I was identifying the characters by their torsos rather than by any distinguishing personality traits, since there aren't any.I was in the mood for a film like ""300"" and wanted desperately to like it, but it wore me down. Now I know how those Persians must have felt.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Action
A Movie Beyond Words...For Once...,"Speechless. That's all I can say. I saw a free previewing at Fort Bliss in Texas, and all I can say is...I'm speechless. Lol. The acting was beyond anything. Maybe it was the concept of the movie that makes me fell this, but either way, the acting is what really makes the movie. Everyone know this. I've been in love with Gerard Butler and his acting since Dracula 2000. He has a knack for playing these kinds of roles. Lena Heady, who I'm not too familiar with, played a queen worth a thousand words. Lol, and one you can't but forget to mention, David Wenham. Now THAT'S a versatile man. From his comedic rules like that in Van Helsing, to the authoritative role in Crocidile Hunter, he now plays in one of the bloodiest movies ever. Even now, I can't think of what to say about this movie without ruining for those who have yet to see it. Let's put it this way. A story within a story, with fluid movement, sharp colors that don't clash...oh, and definitely NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER 17. I mean Jesus man. Why would you bring a child to a movie that's rated R like that? I love the power behind the Spartan world. It's a really great movie, unlike any other that I've seen. As a matter of fact, I'm going four more times for sure. If you liked Troy, you've gotta see this!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Kind of disappointing.,"OK, I know that everyone thinks that this movie what just the greatest thing ever, and I can see why-- it was engaging and visually superb. And I can appreciate all of that.But honestly, I have to say that it didn't really pull me in at any point. With Sin City, the experience was so engrossing that I felt a connection with each of the characters, and I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen for a minute. I just didn't have that feeling here.For whatever reason, I just couldn't get into it. Part of it I think has to do with the original material. The story of Themopoli is really a very simple one, which I suppose doesn't lend itself to character development.Either way, the film is worth seeing for the visuals alone. And the acting was well above average. Enough people seemed to love it, so definitely give it a shot.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
"A Beautiful, Cinematographical Masterpiece","Forget Braveheart. Forget Troy. Forget Gladiator. These films do not hold a candle to the amazing piece of artwork that is 300. Frank Miller with Robert Rodriguez delivered a breakthrough film with Sin City. Miller amazes us once a gain with Zak Snyder with 300, the epic story of Sparta and it's king Leonidas at the battle of Thermopylae. The Battle of Thermopylae is a well known tale, and Miller takes away nothing from historical accuracy (save for the part of the Athenians actions by sea against the Persians) of Spartan life. Gerard Butler's performance is one to be modeled by; his emotional performance as the fearless, and battle-tested leader of the mighty Spartan nation transcends even the scenes in which he is not present. The bond of brotherhood and passion for his fellow man is affluent in this film and every person in the theater will feel that bond in their own bones. What makes 300 standout is that each scene brings a very unique look, from the rustling of the wheat grains while the sun pierces the cloud-covered sky, to Snyder's amazing ability to use human skin as a palate of contrast to the colors around it. Snyder, it seems, never uses the same camera angle twice, and the combination of color and shading makes for an absolute beautiful vision. Much thought had also been put into the music, and sound effects chosen by the director. Powerful choirs set the tone for pre-battle, and the orchestra sings the hearts out of these Spartans. An Epic film, 300 is not. It doesn't even come close. It exceeds ""epic"". ""Stratospheric"" would be better fitting for Zak Snyder and Frank Miller's 300. People will be talking about this film for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Fake Spartans and Fake Persians Fight In CGI,"Zack Snyder's '300' seems to have received mixed opposing responses. There are those that praise it to the point of calling it one of the greatest epics and those that have labelled it as trash. Anyway, let's start with the good point. Most noticeable would be the dazzling visuals. The emphasis on the colour contrast is a tad overdone but the editing and execution of the battle sequences are amazing. However, the use of slow motion is overdone and needs to be toned down. The art direction and makeup department deserve special mention. The cinematography is excellent. The use of CGI is very apparent especially when in motion. Storywise, the writing is pretty simple. It's pretty much the typical epic war story, nothing outstanding. Of course there are historical inaccuracies. Of the cast, Dominic West and Lena Headey are terrific. Gerard Butler and David Wenham are passable.While it is 'pretty' to look at, there isn't much that the viewer takes away from '300' long after the closing credits have rolled because it doesn't have anything new to offer or anything that makes it especially stand out.",,Anonymous,Action
Quite simply and awe-inspiring tale of glory and sacrifice!,"This is a truly magnificent example of quality film making that is great on the eye but even better on the heart. You have no doubt already read about the splendid production values of this film, so i will not bore you with anymore technical jargon. Suffice to say it is breathtaking.The true genius lies in the casting and performance of the cast. To a man (and lady) they are all superb, from the dedication needed to develop their tremendous physiques, to the way they convince the audience of their true love for Sparta.Gerard Butler steals the show as the King Leonidas, a passionate leader that could even inspire me to follow him into war and ultimately death! Although not strictly an accurate account of history, the story never actually claims to be a truthful reenactment, it glorifies the sacrifice and love that a group of 300 men have for their country but more importantly their leader.See this movie with a big group of guys for the best experience, and beware the desire to leave the theater and go straight to the gym or the bar for a fight!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
The anti-epic for the hard rock generation,"From the moment I heard that 300 was based on a Frank Miller graphic novel, I was hooked. I absolutely adored every minute of Frank Miller's Sin City, and liked it even more after I read all 7 graphic novels. So despite not reading the 300 graphic novel, I was still very hooked on the idea, and heavily anticipated the movie. And I was not all that disappointed with the final result.300 is a heavily stylized version of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. To stop the advancing Persian army hellbent on ruling the Greek nation of Sparta, King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) brings 299 of his best men to fight against them. Despite having no real permission from Sparta's elders, Leonidas goes into battle anyway, as his wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), attempts to bargain and get more men to fight alongside him.Despite being epic in its scale, 300 feels like anything but. Everything is so stylized and completely otherworldly that anyone hoping to come and get a history lesson or something in vein of Troy or Alexander is sadly looking in the wrong place. It is more of an anti-epic, and is significantly shorter than any film like those mentioned.All of the scenes are played out in obvious CGI, allowing the scenery to take on a whole life of its own. Much like Sin City before it, everything looks real enough, but clearly looks to be computer animated. It brings a certain element of the graphic novel to life, and allows it to feel more original and not so comparative to those other ancient Greek-style epics. The colours used in the scenes, the backgrounds and on the characters themselves also look very graphic novel-esquire, and all add to how stylish and unique the film looks, particularly scenes that take place at night-time or just after a huge battle.Speaking of battles, all of them are well choreographed and brought to life on screen. Slow motion sequences are frequently put to work here, and they only help to add to how amazingly choreographed and orchestrated the battle scenes are. Just watching these men fight so valiantly is an experience on its own. It is almost like it is a form of dance, coming to life right before our eyes. A dance of course, that is saturated in blood. It flows heavily and fluently throughout the picture, from the days of Leonidas youthful training, and well into every battle. It becomes so red when it flows in certain scenes that it almost turns black as it flies in the wind. Despite it being gratuitous in many areas, it was nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be. This may be as a result of it being all CGI-created (which makes for more blood flying through the air than landing on the ground), but it may just be that my appetite for graphic violence is more than should be expected.Without ruining anything, some of the creatures and monsters that show up during some of these battles are also very cool looking in their uniqueness. They show mere glimpses of them in the trailers, but when they show up on screen, they feel like they are almost completely different in the way they look and act.Another interesting aspect of the film is the use of music. In some scenes, the music pounds in epic opera tones, really stretching for how the film looks as opposed to how it plays out. It works very well, and allows it to feel more at home with the more contemporary epics. But unlike those epics, it blends right into the hard rock that plays throughout the majority of the battle scenes. It pounds and smashes almost at the same speed and veracity as these Spartans and Persians are battling. It is definitely something I was expecting from the trailers, but not something I expected to work so well during these scenes of hyper violence.Butler does a great job carrying the film. He has an obvious presence from the moment he enters the film, and he just hands on with a great amount of strength throughout. Listening to him blare out Miller's poetic writing only continues to perpetuate how different the film is from other historical epics. David Wenham, Vincent Regan and the rest of the actors playing Spartan soldiers hold up to him greatly, and really do a good job at it (bringing in a lot of humour along with Butler throughout the film). Headey surprised me in how much intensity she brings to her role. She is strong-willed from the start and acts like she is almost a soldier herself. Dominic West and Rodrigo Santoro are okay in their roles, but they do not get nearly enough time to really sink their teeth into their roles.If there is anything wrong with the film, it is in just how much style is brought into the film. It looks great when it starts, but watching almost every scene in slow motion becomes a little dull after awhile. Thankfully, many of these scenes are all different in how they are conveyed, but it still does not make up for just how much slow motion is used. I also think that it was slow in certain areas, but really quick in others. It felt like it could have been trimmed down a bit more than it already was, and could have been a whole lot faster paced as a result. It also lacks the spark that made Sin City such a beautiful film, but is more than a worthy successor.While it has a few issues, 300 is the first great film of 2007 and no doubt, will have an impact on its viewers. It is a bloody good time, and has just enough uniqueness to set it apart from other epic-style films.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Excellent Film,"I have been waiting for an Epic from ancient history that was true to form for the longest time. The Movie ""Troy"" changed the story of the Iliad and made it useless for teaching (eg., Agamemnon has to get home to his wife to be murdered and set up the cycles for many tragedies). How could Wolfgang Peterson change a text that was the chief piece of Western literature for 1000 years? ""Alexander"" was just a mess, and showed a tortured confused soul, rather than a person the ancient world admired.The 300 at least gave me a story that I recognized. It is in line with Herodotus and with Stephen Pressfield's recent wonderful book, ""Gates of Fire.""The people who are hung up on the politics are making at least a partial error in transposing todays values on the past. For the Ancients Freedom was not the same as it is for us today. For them the state of freedom was not being a slave, which would have been their condition under Xerxes.Moen Laube (Come get them).",10.0,Anonymous,Action
an advancement or a regression?  You decide,"I guess it's true that everything old is eventually new again.In the early days of movie-making - thanks primarily to budgetary restraints and the logistical problems raised by having to work with primitive sound equipment - directors rarely ventured outdoors to film even their most epic-type adventures. Instead, they were forced to do their filming mainly on a soundstage, shooting their actors in front of a painted backdrop or - when it became available - a more technologically advanced ""blue screen,"" which allowed them to add an array of previously impossible special effects to the picture as well. Then, in the 1950's and 1960's, facing stiff competition from a burgeoning new medium known as television, filmmakers turned to ""on-location"" shooting as a means of both increasing the realism of their pictures and drawing people back to the theaters. This was seen as a great leap forward for the movies both as an art form and as a business.Now, in 2007, Hollywood would appear to have come full circle with ""300,"" a rousing sword-and-sandal epic that has been filmed entirely in a studio, using only CGI effects to recreate its ancient Mediterranean setting. Ironically, this is being hailed as a great ""innovation"" by the very youngsters who would be yelling ""That looks so fake"" at all the similar themed movies from the 1930's and 1940's. Go figure.If ""300"" has the look and feel of a comic book or video game, that is clearly no accident, for it comes from the highly acclaimed graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. The story is based on the Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in 480 B.C. between the Persians, with a fighting force estimated at between 60,000 to 300,000 soldiers, and the Spartans, with a force of a mere 300 (plus around 700 Thespian volunteers). The Spartans, trained from childhood to be professional fighters, ended up losing the battle but not before inflicting heavy losses on the Persian army and becoming a symbol and a source of inspiration for all those unafraid to march into battle despite tremendous odds against them.If it weren't for its unique look, there wouldn't be much to distinguish ""300"" from a hundred other action films. The characters are wafer-thin and stereotypical, and the movie evinces a kind of xenophobia that is more than a trifle disconcerting in a world in which relations between the East and West are none too friendly in the first place. All the Spartans, including their leader, King Leonidas, are light-skinned, noble warriors, while the Persians are dark-skinned, ignoble barbarians, whose general, King Xerxes, comes across as a lisping, mincing, make-up-wearing drag queen. The dialogue and narration, provided by Kurt Johnstad, Michael Gordon, and director Zack Snyder, is invariably cheesy, corny and insufferably self-important, while the actors Gerald Butler, Rodrigo Santoro and Lena Headey pretty much fade into the obscurity of the computer-generated background.But trying to evaluate ""300"" apart from its visuals would be as meaningless as judging ""Jurassic Park"" without its dinosaurs. For the look of the picture is what ""300"" is clearly all about, and on that level, the movie succeeds spectacularly. The sepia-toned images of roiling land- and sky-scapes, massing armies, and storm-tossed oceans are indeed something to behold and give the film an otherworldly quality that goes a long way towards mitigating the weaknesses in the acting and writing. Even the ultra-violent, blood-soaked battle scenes, though a trifle redundant after awhile, take on a legendary quality thanks to the unreal aura of the scene.""300"" is an interesting enough experience as a one-time thing, but I hope it doesn't signal a long term trend in movie-making. Personally, I rather like the great outdoors.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Actually BETTER than I expected.,"I went into this movie expecting a good thrill. I got like 7 helpings of not good, but kick-@ss thrills. It was amazing. The fight scenes are perfect, but you don't feel like you're just watching people getting killed in violent ways like most other big battle movies, you feel like you're watching a big moving painting and a dance combined into one. Sounds weird, looks amazing. The little sub-plot(s) aren't the main focus, but they certainly kept my attention. The Queen really seemed like a smart and powerful woman and played the part perfectly. The Spartans are all played excellently as well. The pacing is interesting, as it jumps around a bit, but you are almost never lost. I've heard people saying this movie promotes gayness and racism, or ties into the Iraq war, I saw none of it. I could just as easily say that star wars is anti-Christian because of the force. It's just a big story, somebody's imagination on screen, it doesn't have to tie into todays world.Overall, It was amazing. Very much deserving a 10(.99999)",10.0,Anonymous,Action

There are some complaints about some Persian figures, but i don't think that the purpose of Snyder was to insult the Iran people, just to center on the Spartans who were the protagonists of the film...besides, the Greek Efialtes, was by far the ugliest character of the film.. The film is great, and if someone sees it as a fact without any symbolisms , he will enjoy it. At the end, is a film for braveness and courage, things that are missing completely these days.....

Oddly uninvolving,"I find Zack Snyder's 300 a bit of a puzzle: I think I admired a lot of it, and I didn't dislike any of it, but it really didn't move me much one way or the other.There's a lot to recommend this movie for. The performances are believable, the visuals are spectacular, and the battle scenes are convincing. Gruesome? I guess, though in a rather stylized way that seems to drain the life out of the whole venture (as opposed to the violence in, say, PAN'S LABYRINTH, which at times made me cringe).Odd, then, that this film that has radically polarized its audience somehow left me as indifferent as it did. I didn't dislike it at all (it's much better than GLADIATOR, for instance), and I found its style intriguing, I just can't say it was enough to get me too worked up.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Not a bad film, just not the masterpiece it promised","300 was one of my personal most anticipated films of this year. That being said, of course it was a letdown for me. However, it manages to raise above the mediocre line as far as films are concerned.It's weaknesses were bad dialogue, which was overly dramatic and came off sounding silly, and it's length. It dragged in many places and could've done better without going into the needless details it did.The film's high point was it's beauty. The whole movie was beautiful, even the terrifying immortals and Xerxes' concubines, as well at the battlefield, were all beautiful in their horror. It has an amazing atmosphere and style not found in many movies. As far as acting, I hand it to Gerard Butler, who gives his best in everything, and David Wenham and Rodrigo Santoro who impressed me.However, the main issue of the film is that it never knows to which audience it caters to. Is it to the Miller fans, and graphic novel enthusiasts? Or is it to the teenagers leftover from Sin City, who love gore and sex, but would be bored by a simple historic film? Or even to the adults who enjoyed other epic movies? It never quite makes up it's mind about this. It tries to be edgy and trendy, and even at times to be shocking, and fails at this, it all seems a little silly and out of place. It fails at the very thing that makes other graphic novel and comic movies succeed.I rated it a 7. If you like historical pieces, war movies, stories of bravery, are a hardcore Miller fan, or are just looking for a good movie to see, try this one out. However, don't get your hopes for masterpiece up too high.",,Anonymous,Action
Very good History/military/horror movie...,"A good movie. Certainly not one for the squeamish. Even I, and avid horror movie guy, was tempted to turn my head a couple of times. This is by far the bloodiest, most violent movie I've ever seen. There are some flaws in the story (Read Herodotus' ""The Histories"" book seven to get the real story) but, overall, the story has some solid historical truths. As a ancient history teacher, I believe this is an appropriate movie to watch. Unfortunately, my students are too young to watch it. If you value things like honor, duty, and others you will find this to be a very heroic story. I like trying to take movies and applying to the present.

Welll made but i'm disappointed,"I feel like a Spartan facing the hordes of fans who will run me over after I dare criticize this movie...The 300 is a very well made movie - no doubt about it - but, as a cinematographic work, it suffers from sticking too much to its origin as a graphic novel. Graphic novels are a special form of expression, with impressive graphics and short texts, but the reader knows he's looking at a graphic novel and suspends his/her disbelief to follow the story. Movies on the other hand, are expected to look and feel realistic. The 300 is somewhere between the two, a comic book with photographic images but not an epic movie like Gladiator.The preview contains 80% of the best scenes of the movie and, furthermore, it does not prepare the viewer for the look and atmosphere of the movie. The CGI is too oppressive, it is ""too much"" and it crushes the performance of the actors and ends up looking phony. The characters are ""flat"", they miss personality (besides Leonidas), they each have one personality trait and that's all we see.The character of Xerses is laughable (but it's not the director's fault, the character comes straight from the graphic novel)and most of the villains look as real as any bad guy from a Batman book. The Spartans are noble and all but once you start looking closely, they start looking unreal and cartoonish. Leonidas' wife is major eye-candy though, and she sticks out like the only realistic character in the whole movie. Also, the dancing oracle is wonderful to look at but if you observe the image too closely, the filming technique used becomes obvious and it ruins the feeling.In short, this movie is an excellent ""moving graphics-graphic novel"" but don't go in looking for Lauwrence of Arabia, you'll be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

A visual art movie with the bonus of action/adventure,"If the idea of Spartans battling an overwhelming Persian army in 480 BC sounds interesting to you - then I think you'll enjoy this movie. I enjoyed the movie immensely and as an action/adventure film it met the requirement of increasing my adrenalin level.I was hoping for something that was good as or better than the 1964 film ""Zulu"". I was disappointed in that respect. There is something very primal about holding off an overwhelming enemy while ensconced in one's ""fortress"". I think the 1971 film ""Straw Dogs"" struck that primitive part of the psyche. A more recent film (of a lower caliber) that played on this aspect of the human psyche was ""Starship Troopers"" - where thousands of giant grasshopper-like aliens attacked a military base. But, this is me saying that ""300"" wasn't the film I was hoping for ¬ñ which of course is essentially irrelevant.It seems evident to me that director Zach Snyder was not reaching for the ""Zulu"" genre. This was a movie designed to create a visual artistic atmosphere based on Frank Miller's graphic novel. In that respect, in my opinion ¬ñ Zach Snyder was extremely successful. The acting was very good and enhanced the overall impact of the visual art.To summarize my opinion: Story/plot: good, Acting: very good, Action/excitement: good, Cinematography: excellentI'll follow my entertainment oriented comments with a little social commentary. I was somewhat interested in what types of non-artistic related reactions the ""300"" would evoke. I guess I wasn't entirely surprised to see an extremely harsh review of the film by the New York City weekly tabloid ""The Village Voice"":""On first glance, the terms couldn't be clearer: macho white guys vs. effeminate Orientals. Yet aside from the fact that Spartans come across as pinched, pinheaded gym bunnies, it's their flesh the movie worships. Not since Beau Travail has a phalanx of meatheads received such insistent ogling. As for the threat to peace, freedom, and democracy, that filthy Persian orgy looks way more fun than sitting around watching Spartans mope while their angry children slap each other around. At once homophobic and homoerotic, 300 is finally, and hilariously, just hysterical.""In this film, the Spartans (and their culture) are good and the Persians are the bad.

A must see!!!!!,"I just saw this film expecting it to have many historical inaccuracies like Alexander or Troy.However,I was pleasantly surprised that the story followed the true events very closely,with small exceptions like the spartan council that was shown as a bunch of monsters,Ephialtes that was shown to come from Sparta(he was actually local from the Thermopylae area) and all the monsters that the persian army was carrying .Still small details like those are not important compared to how greatly the true story of the Battle of Thermopylae(=Hot Gates) was given on the big screen.King Leonidas was put to flesh exceptionally by Gerard Butler,for whoever has seen the real statue of Leonidas at the town of Sparta you see that he looks exactly the same!Same clothes,same shield,same helmet,same spear.The battle itself looked exactly as one must have imagined it while reading about it in historical books.The phalanx and how it worked,the perfect fighting skills of the Spartans,the way they used the narrow passage.Amazing scenes with the Persian arrows covering the sun and the Spartans saying ""then we'll fight in the shadow"".700 Thespians (Arcadians) indeed went to help but they were amateurs as Leonidas mentions so they left before the final battle.The Spartans of course were extremely trained,they were training for battle their whole life. The special effects and the music of the film fitted extremely well to the scenes and I never had to think of it during,it just fitted.The colors were kind of extreme sometimes but perfectly served in order to show the intensity of the facts.I also loved that they used the original phrases that were mentioned from that time,like ""come and get them"",""come with your shield or on it"",""then we'll fight in the shadow"" and the inscription from the real grave of the 300 at Thermopylae. The ending was exactly like I hoped it to be,it showed exactly that Leonidas was not just a proud psycho who wanted to die for glory,but knew that the sacrifice of himself and the 300 would inspire the rest of Greece to come together and fight for their freedom against the invading Persians. It would also delay Xerxi's army,therefore giving enough time to the rest of Greece to prepare for the big battle of Plateai and the Ship-battle of Salamina where Xerxi's army was completely defeated. At last,I would like to mention that this film is talking only about what happened at that time.Of course everyone is free to compare it with modern events but in my opinion it's blasphemy to compare the glorious sacrifice of 300 ancient Greeks for their land and freedom to the War for oil,power and money that the Americans are making around the world.If any comparison could be made then the Persians of that time would be the Americans of today.The Greeks fought against a huge army that invaded their land,threatening their freedom.Therefore,only people that have been invaded by nowadays' biggest militaristic powers and have fought in their land to defend it against them can truly sympathize with it. Congratulations to Franck Miller and Zack Snyder for making an amazing movie without lying on the true facts.May more film-makers get inspired and show the world how real heroes put their lives above any personal ambition.How their sacrifice led to the freedom of Greece after which the Golden era of Perikles came and gave the term ""democracy"" to the world.PS:to Iranian friends,you are right to complain that the film is overreacting with the monsters and the evil look of the persian army.However,at that time the invaders and therefore ""bad guys"" were the persians that had a huge army trying to bring free Greece under their rule.But that was at that time.The future movies to be made about our time will probably be showing the Americans and the other militaristic powers of today as monsters because now they are the ones invading other countries and trying to rule the world.So please don't take it personally,it's just a movie based on a historical event.",,Anonymous,Action
The Strongest European Army ever against a million of Asian Invaders,I'm no fan of video games or comics but this movie is something else. Something out of the ordinary. Something that only a true soldier and patriot can feel and understand. A movie that proves that when people fight united to protect their land they can be a MILLION times stronger than usual. It is a true modern classic that will just blow you away. The movie is incredibly perfect in every way. A must see film for every type of cinema fan. A film that shows the strength and power of the human kind throughout history. Don't look at this film as just another comic to cinema film.

It;s not a documentary,"Very good movie! I find people wondering if the story is true, accurate and so on. It's only a film! What I keep?

What I do not keep? The ultimate piercing of Persians. Well actually the story of 300 Spartians is a fact. Also is the most important fact of the history of Sparta of all times.

"simple, loud, gory - and maybe important nonetheless","Not much subtlety here. I thought the references to ""modern"" concepts and polities was a bit obvious- but you know what? This movie is aimed at young men and you have to be a bit obvious (two-by-four across the head?) to get through to most of them so I can't really fault the approach. You have to know your audience and use the most appropriate avenue. It still works for what I think it was intended to be. In the current age of non-heroes, relativism and selfishness, the story of self-sacrifice is still very powerful and perhaps even more needed.Visually great, even if it was stylized to the point of distraction. Mostly special effects shots. Makes Gladiator look like a history PhD thesis for accuracy (and it wasn't). So what?Gorier than it need to be (""sets a new standard"" which the next film will have to exceed. Ugh.) and anybody that takes an 6 year old to this film should be smacked. Sex, almost-rape, nudity, decapitations, mutilations, etc. Everything you don't want kids to see unless you are... well nevermind no need to be rude. Not as actually disturbing as something like Pulp Fiction or Sin City, maybe because of the setting and context for the violence.The culmination? It was a major conflict between east and west in the ancient world with real impact. Something like this did happen and it is worthy of attention. If it gets young adults to realize that maybe the modern world with our western culture and all the (implied) benefits thereof hasn't sprung from nowhere well then GREAT, and overlook the technical inaccuracies. Not that the Spartans were role models, really. Probably won't be viewed in such a light by most however, perhaps it will intrigue some just enough. And maybe that's just wishful thinking of a middle-aged history buff who likes to think we enjoy a better existence and live in a better world thanks to western culture and ideals (compared to what most of the alternatives would have been). Feel free to disagree, I know many will. And hopefully this film will irritate you silly. Good.It is likely to become a cult classic and have a following for awhile either way.

Must see movie of 2007,"This movie was riveting and inspiring.... The audience broke out in applause twice during the movie. Leonidas was a very charming and transformational leader. The Spartans trusted their ""King"" and believed in their right for freedom and liberty. The cinematography was breathtaking. The set didn't not look ""modernized"" at all but set the mood for time travel back into the past. All in all, it is the characters that draw you into the story line. You begin to empathize for the Spartans and stand behind them in the fight to maintain their freedom.

300 is Evocative and Beautifully Raw!,"This movie is gorgeous to behold! There is bloodshed, but that is unavoidable in a tale that pits 300 Spartans protecting their right to live as free men against a massive army of invading Persians.The bloodletting is not so much extreme as it is relevant and poetic and stylized. Zach Snyder has portrayed this battle - which includes skewered limbs and decapitations - with an artistic grace that removes the 'cringe' factor. The spattering blood is not overdone. It is relevant and understandable. It is elemental.I am a woman and I drank this movie in. 300 strips away all the nonsense that we are sometimes subjected to in story telling and gets to the basics. There is no foolish fluff in this movie. It is raw! Every word, move, action, look and sound is relevant. The soundtrack blends flawlessly. There is nothing to distract you from the pure beauty of the visuals and the unprocessed emotion portrayed. 300 is about strength and honor and courage and even love. I know¬Öthe twenty something males do not want to hear that but it is true. 'My queen, my wife, my love¬Ö' Remember the line.It's as though in preparing their bodies¬Östripping down to raw muscle¬Öthe actors stripped down to raw emotion. Every character is an unfettered archetype. King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) is all a king should be. Power, authority, responsibility, and honor pulse around him and are reflected in his blazing eyes in a way I have never seen before. I did not see Gerard Butler on the screen. I saw King Leonidas and Gerard's portrayal of him was complete and flawless and ferocious. It was compelling enough that I wanted to follow him into battle. Stelios (Michael Fassbender) is the epitome of a strong young man, full of confidence and eager to do his kings will as honorably as he can. Michael was riveting on the big screen. The Captain (Vincent Regan) exhibited such raw emotion as to make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. Theron (Dominic West) made my skin crawl with his seedy smile and dishonorable intentions.The fighting sequences are astounding. I don't recall drawing a breath during the sequence that involved Stelios and Astinos (Tom Wisdom). It was amazing and the cycle involving King Leonidas surging through a throng of Persians was magnificent in its choreography and flow. It was flawless¬Öthe perfect ballet.In 300, Zach Snyder has presented a movie devoid of extraneous and distracting garbage. There is a purity in the visuals, a purity to the soundtrack and a purity to the acting and dialogue that absorbs you, sucks you in and leaves you feeling the two hours where but a moment. To say this movie is cinematic falls flat. Visually, 300 is stunning - a moving piece of art. My biggest disappointment¬Öit ended. This is the first movie in all my 36 years that I will go to the theaters to see again.As far as a message in this movie¬ÖI have to agree with Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro)¬ÖThe message is 'Go Buy A Ticket!' and loose yourself for a short time in a beautiful, evocative, refreshingly raw movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Action

WOW!  What a movie!,"I too, like many others, had doubts as to whether I would like this movie. Truthfully, I don't think I would have gone to the theater to see it if my sons (29 and 30) hadn't asked me to go and see it together. Well, thank you sons for inviting me! This movie was spellbinding from beginning to end. The presentation, passion, and action were all brilliant. The saga of the 300 Spartans has always intrigued me as a military veteran and it was portrayed with such masterful skill that it really put the hook in me. Just get comfortable and open up your mind for some really good entertainment. Make sure you go when the theater is at least half full. It is neat to hear the audience outbursts! There is a fair amount of equally rationed violence (of course), nudity, ugliness, passion and an abundance of nonchalant behavior by the Spartan warriors in the face of imminent death. After the movie, as we stood outside and talked for awhile in the parking lot, a huge group of people were cheering Spartan battle cries at the top of their lungs over and over. The movie is ""larger than life"" and very enjoyable.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Gladiator on Steroids!!!!!!!!!!,"What a great piece of cinematic history this movie is - ground breaking CGI, music and a fantastic rendition of Frank Miller's comic books! Miller meant his comics to be more contemporary and a little ""tongue-in-cheek"" I believe. It is not meant to be a true historical re-telling or a documentary of this heroic tale. It is what it is - a ""kick-ass"" version that is heavy on mood and violence with nice little dollops of humor on occasions! If you approach it as for what it is, you will thoroughly enjoy the experience! The acting was superb - Gladiator on Steroids - Leonidas beautifully played by Baker and Henly as a sexy but hard-nosed Queen. The supporting cast, even the Persians, were great too and Xerxes was painfully exquisite as a rather tall and ""pin-cushioned"" king! My only critique is with regard to the Immortals - I understand what Miller was doing but to me they sort of looked like grown-up ""Teenage Ninja Turtles!"" They really did! However, that aside, this is a great movie and one worth seeing many times - my next trip will be to an IMAX theatre - now that should be something!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Of course it excels most in the technical categories and I really hope it gets some Oscar nominations in categories like cinematography, art direction, special effects and much more. Because it really deserves it. I doubt I will see a better film in theaters all year. I haven't been so amazed by a movie in the theaters since United 93 and I haven't had so much in the theater sine Borat or maybe even King Kong. This is an experience.Hmm... the plot well there isn't much but Snyder does as much as he can with it. The movie is basically about 300 Spartans ( Led by Leonidas.) who take on a million or so Persians in order to maintain their land. There is also another story taking place back in Sparta where King Leonidas's wife is fighting a war of her own. This war does not have swords or blood though. She is fighting a war of words against the senate in order to send more warriors to help the 300. In both stories betrayal is a theme. And that's all I can really tell you with out giving some surpirsing moments away.This is a super violent, super sexy movie which is highly enjoyable ( the whole theater was applauding.) but well made as well.

Not a frame wasted,"I recently was able to attend an advance screening of ""300"", and I have to say, while my expectations were high, this film easily exceeded them. I won't go into the fight scenes, because they are almost indescribable. I will say that even though the battle scenes are violent, they are truly beautiful. Also, to say this is ""loosely"" based on Frank Miller/ Lynn Varley's graphic novel is to do a disservice to the screenwriters, who faithfully adapted the story, and Director Zack Snyder, who matched many of the shots directly from the book. I can't stress enough how much fun, and how gorgeous this movie was. Visually, there is not a frame wasted. Even the end title sequence is fun to watch. While the acting is melodramatic, it certainly doesn't hurt the movie, and when they deliver the lines that come directly from the graphic novel, you can only cheer. I can't wait this again.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
not been this disappointed in a long time,"OK, i should state from the outset that i have been waiting to see 300 for several months, the trailers looked awesome, i think its fair to say i had high expectations. The reality unfortunately has left me a little empty. First the plus points: 1. Gerard Butler is superb, brooding, sensitive, authoritative, menacing remarkably all at the same time, his is the only standout performance in the movie.2: Visually this is arguably one of the most consistent cgi movies ever made, beautiful scenery, brutal battle scenes, absolutely stunning.Im sorry to say that is where it ends. The dialogue at times is cringe-worthy. The first 30 minutes had me wriggling in my seat because i was fighting to stop myself leaving. The effort to establish characters was rushed to the point where we only felt connected Leonidas and all the other cast were met with indifference.Now my final complaint and for me it ruined the whole experience, the almost constant, intrusive and downright childish narration. If there is an Oscar for someone stating the bloody obvious it should go to the character who was forced to speak over several key moments with completely banal comments. Example, when Leonidas leaves for battle he sees his queen for the last time, we can see how they feel we appreciate how they feel, we know Leonidas loves her we know he is ever going to see her again the actors manage to convey this to the audience through their expressions and minimal dialogue. OK, fine, then we get some pillock talking over the top telling us how Leonidas felt like we haven't just experienced it. I got the impression the director did not either trust the audience to be intelligent enough to pick up on the subtleties or he didn't think the actors could convey any emotion without dialogue to accompany it.I know the narration is in the past tense from the one survivor of the battle but it is supposed to fill in gaps and move the story on, not give us a running commentary.I know it does not sound much but seriously it damn near ruined the whole thing for me.Butler, and the outstanding fight scenes, by that i include the queens political fight back home, are the only things that persuaded me to stay put.In fact how about remaking the whole thing with just music, turn it down when butler speaks then turn it back up again. Problem solved.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
"Tonight, we dine in HELL!","I just returned from a midnight screening and all I can say is wow, the movie industry has managed to create something bold, original, weird and at the same time extremely enjoyable. After Lord of the Rings, we were tired of seeing massive battles that used CGI to create armies containing hundreds of thousands of troops, and after Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven, Braveheart, etc.... I was a bit tired of the historical period-piece films.300 has managed to rejuvenate this genre. Snyder (director) was not afraid to mold his movie into the image of the graphic novel it is based on. The skies glow vivid colors, and the clouds seem to almost touch you in the theater. The use of slow-motion, even in non-battle sequences, made certain segments so much more impacted. One thing I will commend them for is not over-using the slow-motion, and keeping the camera controlled (no shaky/Blair Witch Project here, you can clearly see the battle scenes).The story moves relatively quickly into the main plot line: the 300 Spartans making a stand against the might of the ""million man"" Persian army (although the trailer claimed a million, in the movie Leonidas only comments that the Persians ""claim their army is in the millions""). Once it begins, it grabs you and doesn't let go.The Spartans are unarmored, wear heroic red cloaks and look like the fiercest SOB's you will ever see. The fighting direction was very effective, and the use of blood splatter made the fight scenes unique (although I could complain none of the blood ever made it to the floor and stained the ground, partly due to it being 100% CGI).However, past the blood and historical inaccuracies, the only thing that truly bothered me was the freaks/monsters. A mutant who is locked in chains and then ""unleashed"" on the Spartans, a hunchback who follows around the Spartan army, a Rhino strapped with war ""garments"" and war elephants resembling those of Lord of the Rings. I understand these are stylistic devices from the graphic novel but they could have toned it down a little bit. I loved the look of the immortals, but the rest of the Persian Army generally looked like crappy Middle-Eastern militia fighters, against the gleaming, flowing red capes of the Spartans.This movie made we want to grab a spear and head in the Phalanx formation. If you like action, fighting, a bit of nudity (and for those girls, 300 sculpted and muscular Spartans), this movie is for you. Forget guns: This is SPARTA!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
It's horrible and great at the same time.,"This film does not accommodate the thinkers of the crowd, nor is it one for the historians. ""300"", in all essence, is a man-movie through and through, not just for the alpha mentality of its battle-hardened Spartan men, but also in every other aspect from politics to the context of its sex scenes to the very simplistic, defiant and angry dialog. If there were ever a film that could define Rosie Odonnell's most ill perceived personal hell, this is it. However, it is not without a woman's scorn or influence. In a nutshell, 300 will leave you disgruntled if you demand political correctness, sexual equality, historical accuracy or believability from your movie experiences.What this movie brings to the table is quite simple: barbaric mutiny displayed in epic proportions. It is full of psychological scare-tactics warriors would use to instill fear in their enemies, from massive walls built with corpses to a messenger that carries with him the crowned skulls of once defiant Kings. Couple that with the visuals and camera work that is nothing short of impressive and awe-inspiring and you'll have many reasons to like this movie.That said, there are things about this film that will ruin it for you, in my opinion, and will prevent it from making the all-time lists of top movies made for men. There are a few instances where CGI is overdone to the point of cheesy. There are occasions where actors are forced to step out of character to accommodate a dialog that is surprisingly uncharacteristic of the roles they are playing, and it's very noticeable. There's also one scene that the movie had invested time to build up to, intended to be serious and inspiring, but when the scene finally comes the main actor seems to be on the verge of laughing about something that happened on the set, like a botched take.However, even though there are just a couple of over-the-top acting moments and a few, very weak, two or three line castings, I cannot blame the acting at all. In fact, there's not only some good acting to be found in this film, but some of the most emotionally impactive acting can be found when there is no dialog at all: Testimony to the fact that it's just a horrible script meshed with several careless director oversights.On a side note, using industrial-type music in the score, even though it's used sparingly, doesn't exactly help the movie either. Once this film becomes dated, it's going to be much worse.Overall, you should go into this movie expecting nothing more than a lot of grim eye candy, valiant chest-beating and twisted concepts that would make Vlad the Impaler proud.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

Historical Epic as Auto Commercial,"As pure an example of de-evolution as you're likely to see on screen this year, 300 takes the grand tradition of Hollywood historical epics and reduces it to the level of a TV commercial.The filmmakers have reduced one of the seminal tales of western civilization to a bunch of stale catchphrases and lovingly photographed, slow-motion violence. Philosophically, this is a good movie for those who found the ""Star Wars"" movies to be too subtle. Virtually everyone who opposes our noble heroes is portrayed as, quite literally, an inhuman monster, while visually, the only tricks the director and editor seem to have brought to the table are (a) color everything bronze and (b) the old slow-fast-slow routine, a digital effect that was thoroughly played at least five years ago.Add in some endless fields of softly swaying wheat, and all that was missing was for the latest Dodge SUV to come sweeping majestically around the mountains.",,Anonymous,Action

An epic film well executed.,"The story is presented as a narration of a series of events exaggerated to the extreme of hyperbole, to make the blood of the warriors who will fight for freedom boil, a story whose merit lies with Frank Miller as the creator of the original work. This results in a tremendous action film.The pace is well handled, condensing the entire story in the best way, with some slower moments that do not harm immersion in this tale. The performances are suitable in most cases, contributing to said immersion.The major problem with this film is its abundant use of CGI and computer-generated backgrounds, which at times is too noticeable, to the point of taking you out of the narrative. Nevertheless, considering that probably 80% of what we see on screen is CGI, the film manages it well and serves an impressive cinematography, very much in line with the comic it adapts. Another aspect that caused me some displeasure was the excessive grain in the image. Do not misunderstand me; personally, I love that aspect in movies, but in this instance, it was simply too much, especially intrusive in close-ups.As small details to add, there is Snyder's classic use of slow-motion, which in this case, I find excellently executed. On the other hand, I found it amusing the use of CGI to add abs to the characters; it was simply too obvious in some scenes.Having said that, it seems to me a great film and one of the director's best along with Dawn of the Dead.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Graphic Novels and Their Effects,"It's absurd how many people are forgetting that 300 is based on a graphic novel, a comic book. One of the major parts of a comic book is to glorify the hero and discredit the villains. All Frank Miller did was write a comic book that told a story in a legendary way. Yes he built the Spartans up to be some kind of super human army, and yes he portrayed the Persian as vile scum trying to take over the world, but that is exactly the kind of story telling audiences of graphic novels are looking for. If anyone knew anything about the film and the novel, they would know its not supposed to be accurate. Its supposed to be a legend, and legends aren't always the truth. It was also written from the Spartan point of view. From that view point, the Persians were the enemy and they wouldn't have been seen as great people. They would have been seen as terrible even though it was not the truth. Its like when you're a kid and you don't like someone else on the play ground because they beat you at a game. They could be an amazing kid, but you will only see them as bad because you are opposing each other.As for the criticism over the colors and lighting of the movie, they were trying to keep the graph novel feel of Frank Miller. The dramatic slow motion and speeding up had a very graphic novel feel. It was an amazing depiction of the graphic novel in movie form.",,Anonymous,Action

I enjoyed this movie less than Sin City, just because I thought the acting was not the greatest, while in Sin City it played a big role. The music really kicks in with the action.

Unleashing a Massive Load of Testosterone in a Fancifully Gory Version of a Real-Life Battle,"In 480 B.C., the Battle of Thermopylae was a precursor of the more familiar Battle of the Alamo in 1836. Both were examples of how a small battalion of men was able to fend off a much larger army by a combination of resourcefulness, fortitude and sheer will. However, the scale of Thermopylae was far more dramatic as 300 Spartans under King Leonidas held at bay for three days over a quarter million Persians under Xerxes the Great. Directed with technical flourish by Zack Snyder, this visually elaborate 2007 action film is a fictionalized retelling of that momentous event as it was vividly envisioned in Frank Miller's 1999 graphic novel. Similar to the 2005 adaptation of Miller's ""Sin City"", a constant parade of striking, often gory images is what drives the momentum of the screenplay co-written by Snyder, Kurt Johnstad and Michael P. Gordon. However, unlike that story and more similarly, Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"", a coherent narrative flow and a more involving sense of character development are lacking to a significant degree.The net result is a stylish piece of juvenile pop entertainment but hardly more substantive than a typical Italian sword-and-sandal picture from the early 1960's. Things start promisingly as we are presented with a cursory overview of Leonidas' fate as King of Sparta when he is separated from his mother at age seven to undergo the rigorous training necessary to have the courage and bloodlust of a true leader. The problem is that Snyder keeps painting the story's mythological aspects with broader and broader brushstrokes. Dialogue takes on a contemporary, almost comical tone that makes it difficult to take seriously the gravity of the events depicted. The battle scenes, especially an overindulgent use of slow motion, are equally outlandish with the gore so exaggerated and figures so grotesque (like the Uber-Immortal) that it makes it difficult to understand or even care about the motivations behind the characters' actions. Everything is larger than life and so lacking in detail and nuance that all the actors can do is accommodate the over-stylized treatment.The pumped-up, half-clothed bodies match up well with the comic book sensibilities on display here, chief among them Gerard Butler, who is ideally cast as Leonidas. It's not a complex role, but even with his distinctively Scottish brogue, he has no problem showcasing the nobility, stubbornness and mocking cockiness necessary to be leading such an audaciously fatalistic military strategy. Made up like a bejeweled NY-glam boy, Rodrigo Santoro seems less than a match for the commanding Leonidas as the seemingly omnipotent, seven-foot Xerxes. Better is Lena Headey as the Spartan queen Gorgo, whose devotion to Leonidas goes unabated in home front scenes, where she has to fend off the advances of the dastardly Theron while begging the state council to send more troops. The rest of the cast really doesn't register much beyond the epic film stereotypes they are playing, including David Wenham's obligatory turn as the narrator Dilios. It takes a certain artistry to provide grace and power to a story mythologized from a real event, but it appears most of the filmmakers' efforts lie on the surface.The two-disc 2007 DVD package should make fans palpitate with glee. Disc One has the best extra - the constantly informative commentary track from Snyder with periodic contributions from Johnstad and director of photography Larry Fong. There is no doubt Snyder did a lot of research, and he is extremely forthcoming with the behind-the-scenes details, which in this case, is very helpful. Disc Two contains a lot of small extras, the most prominent being the mostly intriguing 24-minute ""300 Spartans: Fact or Fiction?"", in which Miller, Snyder and historians discuss the painstaking detail as well as the liberties taken with this interpretation of the actual battle. Another historically oriented short and a brief making-of featurette are also included, as well as a quick short on the translation of the blue-screen images. Miller is interviewed separately in one fifteen-minute piece, and there is a multi-chapter Web production diary, which seems to be a more common feature on DVD sets these days.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

John wick : 480BC,"This movie has the same 'problem' as John wick, which isn't really a ad thing, that it is constant action with no plot. I didn't care for any of the characters as there was no development so the emotional scenes fell flat. The narrator was a bit annoying, they should show not tell, which works so much better in movies. None of this really matters though as the movie is soooo outrageous gory and fun! The movie is so stylised and the action flows so well. Any frame of the movie could be used as a poster, besides some awkward looking cgi shots. It was just enjoyable, I didn't need to pay any attention to what was actually happening. It also has some epic one liners which I will definitely reference and have been without even seeing or before I even knew the movie. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Action

Could be a successful propaganda,"I feel exactly the same as many people about this movie (i.e kind of fascist values, melting defense of the race and civilization, body glorification, and hate over decadent and perverse eastern peoples), but I am wondering about the intent: was it made to condemn that fascism or to glorify it? I preferred to choose the second option, while kind of liking the movie anyway. It is well shot, not too bloody, and much better than epic movies like ""the lord of the rings"". Sex scenes are very exciting and beautiful, as well as the oracle's scene. I also fear that this version of the Battle of Thermopylae will be kept in the mind of main people to be historical. We do know that Xerxes was not evil and Leonidas was not good. The reality of both aechemenid Persia and Sparta is more complex. Anyway, we must also remind that the story of the Battle of Thermopylae had been written in ancient times to be a glorification to Sparta and Greece, as a propaganda against new enemies and towards a unification of the geek cities. We knew the same with the war of Troy, the battle of Marathon, all Egyptian stories, even the bible's stories were mainly made for strategic and political goals. So, it would not be fool to think that this movie nowadays could be used as a propaganda against Iran and/or an alliance of Turkey with Asian states.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Mindless mix of nudity and gore,"This is one of the worst period-action-war movies I have ever seen.The director seems to think that all it takes to make a period-action movie is to employ state-of-the-art technology and make it all wild.The movie is set in a permanent painting like scenery which makes you think that the movie just came live out of a Middle Ages painting.The movie goes on in a monotone with adrenaline pumped high throughout. There is no build-up of story, just war-mongering. The characters look all artificial with their fake ribs and metallic bodies.It seems the director has taken the Greek dictum of 'male body being perfect' too much to the heart. There is unnecessary nudity (both male and female). A little less ugly characters would also have done.The worst thing is, there is no line drawn between history and mythology. Greek priests and the Persians are shown as mythological demons. The movie 'Troy' is also set more than two-thousand years ago, but still it is clearly a historical movie and not a mythological one. You cannot make such distinction in 300.I was particularly disgusted by the portrayal of Persians. They are shown as the ugliest creatures, straight out from Hell! And for Pete's sake! Persians were and are white in skin-color! Why on earth, did the director decide to let black men play for them! The movie is low on emotions. You never feel loss on the death of a character. The story simply fails to build up due to the bad direction.300 has got nothing in common with movies like Gladiator, Braveheart, Troy etc.Only if you want to see a mindless mix of stupidity, nudity and gore then this movie is fit for you.",4.0,Anonymous,Action
Unbelievable!!!,"Today 300 premiered worldwide in Greece (even though some Greek theaters arranged some screenings on 7th of March near midnight). What can anyone really say after seeing this spectacular movie? It's all about your entertainment really!!! Don't expect to see a documentary or all the historical facts. It's purely for what it meant to be. A Hollywood movie based on Frank Millers' comic, which itself was based on the story of Leonidas and his 300 men that fought against Xerxis and his vast army(to say things in plain English). I'm not going to bore you with details and so, just to say that the movie is a milestone for the film industry considering the whole package, acting(Butler is absolutely mad(!), really into his role, photography is breathtaking making you to hit the button (if there was any) and to make any shot your favorite wallpaper and finally directing is beyond any fantasy. Some may try to compare it with Sin City and the Lord of The Rings. Well, as years go by the sure thing is that films that depend on technology will outdo the older ones. This is the case and for that, the comparison would be unfair and subjective. Don't get mad or disappointed. Maybe Sin City 3 will outdo 300 as well(well Sin City 2 may find things difficult, don't really know, just a thought). To summarize, one of the best movies I have ever seen, even though I can't get out of my mind the fact that there was only one external shot, a real test for your eyes and your mind!!! If I would see it again?Definitely!!! By the way I expect a serious DVD packaging and of course an Extended Version!!!Yes we wants it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Victory ! (DVD),"This story was introduced to me by Frank Miller's graphic novel. This creator has a real talent for telling stories about virtuous heroes and in addition is blessed with amazing style that is incredibly enhanced by his wife colorist, Lynn Varley. I remember I collected the comics in Strasbourg (1999) and was absolutely speechless with the art and colors: it really looks like Hellenic art with brown, yellow tones.Now, comes the movie and I was sure it kicks ass as well because the director had delivered a perfect adaptation with ""Watchmen"". This guy really understand what is an adaptation: this isn't about retelling a story, nor adding personal comments about it. As he said in the making-of, there's no place for filter and Miller has been every day on the set because they kept opening and browsing the comics to analyze every frame of it.Fom the opening credits, it's a pleasure to see that Miller's work has been moved 100% on the screen: the colors, the pencils, the wardrobe, everything thing you saw on a panel is alive! Amazing! The cast was unknown so far for me but they are great: Leana Headey is impressive: her formidable charisma helps a strong willed queen and comforting wife. Gerald Butler is terrific as he reminds me of Pacino!Now, we can talk about the story: I remember that there was a huge debate with some readers complaining about Miller's depicting Athenians as boy lovers. This sentence has been kept in the movie and don't make such a fuss. On the opposite, the movie is now seen as a clash of civilization: the west, holder of liberty against the east, decadent and pervert. Well, I got Greek friends who didn't find accurate the Xerces army portrayal. Personally, this story is about courage and bravery and the price to keep liberty, whatever or whoever the threat comes from. In addition, it's great to see that women has naturally a role to play whereas sometimes they are totally forgotten (see ""The winds that shakes the barleys"" or ""Angels and Demons"").",10.0,Anonymous,Action

There is nothing else like it,"Zack Snyder's biggest flaw is that he makes movies with mature subject matters but with an infantile sensibility.In this movie for instance, there is undergoing theme of honour and freedom. Yet, any time we get a glimpse of the Spartan way of life, it goes precisely against those concepts. The Spartan sons are sent to be soldiers at an early age. There does not seem to be a lot of freedom involved.In the same vein, Leonidas is not really honourable. He kills peaceful ambassadors in cold blood, including his escort. He has contempt for his superiors, lies to his equals, and when his allies arrive, he promptly denigrates them. Except for the scene with Ephialtes where he shows humanity and compassion, Leonidas is an all-round jerk with a superiority complex.At one point, someone mentions in passing that Leonidas should be jailed when returning home, and it is hard not to agree. However, this is where the Snyder touch comes into play. The villain says that, you're not supposed to agree. The movie celebrates Leonidas and his anti-social behaviour. The movie presents a society that looks like a fascistic wet-dream and proceeds to extol it. No joke, or irony, or parodic message. It is straightforward. It present this rigid warrior society and proceeds to evoke freedom and honour every chance it gets. Nevertheless, it never really understands the dichotomy it presents. It does not get the antithesis, and misses the contradiction. The fact that sub-text is a thing is foreign to this film.You could drive the same analysis for the homo-eroticism of the film. It is painfully macho and anti-gay. With a schoolyard bully kind of energy. At the same time, it is sub textually, unabashedly gay. Through dialogue, it says being gay is bad, but visually: here, have a look at these shirtless buff dudes. Almost everyone is gay, or wants to be gay. I can't figure out if the characters are ashamed and embarrassed by the gayness or are so overtly gay and liberated about it that it does not need to be acknowledged. Like, it is understood that they are all gay, no need to mention it. It is obvious.The plot and the dialogue are, on the surface, awful. In addition, the movie's dialogue and the visual storytelling are at odds. Yet, and it might a hidden virtuoso talent of Snyder's, in a way none of it matters. The movie is not built narratively but visually and in that aspect, it works. It is a movie made to be watched and admired. It looks good and it is masterful in how it shows action scene and combat. In that regard, Synder knows what he is doing. The trick of course is that he relies heavily on the source material, but it is an actual example of a successful adaptation.It does not matter what the movie is about, what matter is how it looks. It just happens that it looks unique and rather amazing.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Perfect Payback movie,"The first few minutes of the film were slow, but necessarily slow, as you were given background information you needed on Sparta to know why these people were the people they were. But once it kicked into the actual story it was awesome.The action was solid, the acting was excellent except that someone needs to explain to Gerard Butler that louder doesn't always mean more powerful. But then again this is a ""comic book"" movie with a ""larger than life"" feel to it. This is quite a contradiction of a film in that it is both grotesque and beautiful. It is gory and shows the raw brutality of the life and war even more forcefully by showing the beauty of it as well. This combined with the dry, deadpan humor and testosterone dripping banter between the men throughout, provided the necessary moments for the audience to take a deep breath between the horrors.I saw it on a regular screen, but it screams to be on IMAX.

Perfect for what it was.,"There are times when a film starring virtually unknown actors electrifies the screen and the audience. This is one of those times. From beginning to end, I was riveted to my seat. I predict that a few years from now, when some people say, ""They don't make 'em like that anymore,"" they'll be referring to ""300"" and movies like it.Now, a ""critical"" comment on certain ""critics."" There are a lot of naysayers who complain about historical inaccuracies in the film. My question to them is ""Why?"" This movie is about a real historical event and many of the roles were of real people who participated. But everyone going into this movie KNEW (or should have known) that it was based on a ""graphic novel."" Some such novels are referred to as ""faction"" - a mixture of fact and fiction. So I went into the theater expecting nothing more than a good tale of action and adventure. And, I got what I was looking for. Critics looking for a factual retelling of events should rent or buy the History Channel special, ""Last Stand of the 300."" But if you do, buy some ""No-Doz"" tablets to stay awake ... something no one needed to take for this film.Final note. If you're wondering why I only rated it 9 out of 10, here's why. I was totally immersed in the action when a film-goer 2 seats behind me started laughing and said, ""Oh, God - a smallpox vaccination."" My eyes were immediately drawn to the bare upper left arm of a Spartan soldier who was talking to Leonidas and, sure enough, there was a big-as-life circular smallpox vaccination scar on his arm. It did take some enjoyment away from the film as I confess to spending some of my time looking for other flubs (Rolex watches, etc.). Didn't see any.

Shallow,"In every generation, there's usually a film that explores new grounds. Way back in the 60s, Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" changed the film medium and, theoretically, paved way for the MTV visuals. Lucas's ""Star Wars"" continued this by launching the Force of endless possibilities on visual sci-fi effects. In the 90s, Wachowski Brothers' ""The Matrix"" was the ""it"" movie--philosophically and visually brilliant. Fast forward to this decade--after Peter Jackson wowed us with his epic trilogy, almost every blockbuster attempts to have the gargantuan spectacle of ""The Lord of the Rngs"". Watching the theater trailer of Snyder's adaptation of Frank Miller's ""300"", some people thought that this movie will break new grounds in cinematic history. Unfortunately, ""300"" might have to settle under the shadow of ""The Lord of the Rings"" (that is without even mentioning the presence of Faramir, the gollum look-alike character, oliphaunts, trolls, and millions of Middle-earth-like warriors marching on in Sparta).While being visually stunning, the cinematography of this movie just wants to be noticed. Every picture or every scene in the movie seems to want to say, ""Hey! This shot is epic!"" True, almost every scene in the movie can stand as part of a series of beautifully composed paintings--add some perfect abdominal muscles and hard feminine nipples to boot--you have a full-scale work of art. Yes, it's an adaptation of a graphic novel--and, unfortunately, it seems to be merely a graphic novel in motion, if not a video segment in a very complicated PC or virtual reality game.The overused slow/fast motion technique can be effective if used sparingly yet appropriately. Ironically, the perfectly composed scenes just drag the viewer from one scene to the next, expecting more beauty, more mythical images, that in the end, it's just exhausting to the wide-eyed viewer. The movie makes no apologies for its raunchy, sexually arousing scenes which fittingly juxtapose the ultra-violent bloody war segments. Sex and violence in the Greek times, as depicted in different mythology stories, can be understandable if interpreted with consideration to their cultural richness. What fascinates and repulses me at the same time is how this film has taken those two aspects and made them modern--way TOO modern that sex and violence in ""300"" can leave the audience desensitized.The script and its execution by many of the mediocre actors here are not even worthy to be given a criticism.The one important thing missing in this film can be summed up by one word: depth.Movies can be picture perfect, but there is more to the cinematic language than its flawlessly composed and enhanced visuals--the movie, ideally, must tell a story which paves way to understanding our human nature, psyche, and soul--if not, it poses more questions on human morality, aesthetics, and beliefs.""300"" flexes exceedingly perfect muscles that are mostly found below the head.

In a word, it's ridiculous.You hardly see a ""free man"" (Spartan that is) die, they are cracking jokes while slaughtering their enemies.This fiesta of violence is underlined by a macho sounding narrator repeating words like ""freedom"", ""bravery"" etc.I'm certainly not opposed to violent movies, but this senseless display of violence probably for the purpose to dehumanize Asians appalls me.If the message of this movie weren't so dangerous, I would call it a ""Baywath of violence"" with all its slow-motion scenes of cut off arms, legs and heads.I have rarely seen such a huge piece of bullshit in a movie!",1.0,Anonymous,Action

Sensational Epic,"In fact, 'Epic' would be an understatement. To put it simply, 300 is a revolution in modern cinema, bringing back the classic 'epics' of old (Spartacus for example) and refining it to the point of perfection. No movie that I've seen has come close to the sheer power and ferocity that encompasses 300, coupled together with the fascinating story of the might of the Spartans against the incomparable number of Persians.Visually, well, it's just mind-blowing. Reminiscent of Sin City and Gladiator, the direction and color offers a unique and awe-inspiring feel and energy to the movie. The CGI is just fantastic, portraying some truly frightening beasts and unsettling warriors. The battle scenes make The Two Towers battle scene look like a bunch of drunken hooligans at the bar, but then again, 300 did not hold back on the onslaught of blood and gore, no complaints there.The only possible negativity I could see in the movie is that maybe the excessive violence won't suit some, but the fact is, the genre it's in, the comic it's based on and the story that ensues, you'd have to be crazy to think it isn't apt. 300 is a classic of our time and a milestone in cinematic history.

Good movie with some overlaps,"OK, let's face it, this is not a masterpiece and it is not the best war movie ever. 300 throughout the movie keeps you seated with a palm full of popcorns and your eyes starring at the screen. The movie starts off really well, with an introduction to the harsh spartan way of life and the entering of a Spartan boy to the ""Agogi"". This completely historically accurate. Studying Greek history and being Greek-athenian my self i can tell you this. I would like to inform people who rushed to judge this movie as over exagerrating and a hyperbole that they should take a closer look at Greek history. the cast throughout the story performs well, with really solid acting, the type of actign required for war movies (do not expect super acting though, the film is revolving around Leonidas personality more than the rest). The film has great soundtracks with tasty tones which make you want to listen to them over and over again, (especially the Bulgarian music towards the end of the music). One of the disadvantes of the movie would probably be the the background which is used in the movie with the yellowish,cloudy,dark mood which is unreal. Although some of the effects used during the battle are smart and give an eery mood to the viewers.Overall this is a good movie, with great sequence, mostly historically accurate, but is trying too hard to make things impressive. Don't judge it that hard.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Short and Powerful,"I had very high expectations for this film, and I must say that it has exceeded far beyond my expectation.Although some may consider the story too simplistic, it is nonetheless so powerful that the simplicity can almost be overlooked; we should consider that the story is a based on a tiny portion of the tales about Spartan wars. The storyline may not be perfect, and perhaps even a bit melodramatic, but its flaws are excusable as are adapted from a comic.The cinema-graphics were just amazing, probably the best and most artistic battle scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Anyone who's a graphic junkie should definitely see this film on the big screen.Also, for those who protest that the Persians were wrongfully portrayed in this film, please realize that this is a comic-adaptation of a film, and that most people probably do recognize the fantasy in it. I doubt anyone really believed that the Persian king was some eye-liner-wearing tall freak with jewellery all over his face who sits on a 6-foot golden throne carried by people....or that he really has those mask-wearing, ninja-wannabe death soldiers. So please stop making a big deal out of it.All in all, this is the most entertaining film of the year so far, and we should just appreciate its beautiful choreography, its fantastic graphics, and the powerful performances that Butler and his fellow actors gave us.If you're going to spend $$ to feast the eyes on the silver screen, spend it on this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"Action and entertainment are 10/10, content and script are 0/10","When I watched the trailer 0f 300, I was shocked and thought that it would be an unusual, unconventional and in a good way weird movie. In fact, yes, 300 is very different from many epic movies, but only in terms of action and a few shots. Almost the whole movie consists of perpetual action scenes which is great. To me, this is a very important step for action cinema. Alexander the Great, Troy, Kingdom of Heaven, Gladiator, there are much more action in 300 than all these movies. However, the problem that makes 300 very very disappointing is the script. There are some bizarre details firstly. For instance, blood of Persians spills in pitch-black. I think that may be, Zack Snyder had not wanted to make the movie censored or the movie tries to mention that Persians are evil by nature! It is clearly seen that the color of blood of the Persians in the movie is black! Whatever the reason, it looks annoying. In addition, the visual effects, especially blood effects would have been realistic, but in some parts, the movie looks like a computer game, visual effects are shockingly superficial and I cannot see any reason for it. Why? How could they release the movie like that? Spartans slaughter Persians while they are half dead, lying on the ground, screams, begging. While they laugh, a Persian dies. In another scene, they shout no mercy, but when a Spartan is killed, that alters matters, we see some tragic moments, the father crocks up and the narrator talks poetically. It is extremely clear that Snyder discriminates against the other side. Also it causes that we cannot like Spartans. Personally, I hated them at times and especially Stelios. The Spartans get angry unduly that is OK, but it seems that they slaughter Persians with great pleasure, not because they have to do that. By the way, Persians do nothing like killing or raping the public. I confess that I could not feel any compassion or feel sorry for any Spartan, instead thought the opposite at times, after all those that happen. Another issue, Xerxes has a huge army, but The Spartans give them hell without any real effort or pain. The script writers would have overcome this big absurdity by thinking a little bit! For example, I have a solution. Because of his extreme arrogance, Xerxes does not send all his army. He releases small groups to kill The Spartans, so the three hundred men rout them every time. Then... Something like that. The immortals. I won't ask the question, what does a mortal immortal mean? However, let's suppose that Xerxes might call his elite warriors as the immortals because of his haughtiness. Although, they look very interesting and also crawly, when they begin to fight, we see that they are pretty weak and passive. In the fifth minute of the war, they call help. In fact, all the Persians in the movie are like that. They are represented as very weak, untalented and silly warriors. According to the movie, they do not know exactly how to fight, one Spartan gets on the war area and kills approximately ten Persians at the same time! 300 is a very entertaining movie and very stylish. Some characters are very interesting; The Immortals, Xerxes, the monsters, animals. I watched the war scenes tons of times, each time enjoyed, especially the battle with the immortals, it is great, the arrow moments, the first clash at the hot gates etc. but the rest is too hard to bear at.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Great Movie,"This was absolutely one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Action, drama, great FX, and a fantastic story. It is of course a fictionalized acct of the Battle of Thermopylae. But the basic premise combined with great FX and backgrounds are truly moving.If you are looking for historical facts, then this movie is not for you. If you are looking for a great time at the theaters then I would seriously recommend checking this movie out.For the protesters of any and everything in the world, all I have to say is get over it. Stop taking yourself so seriously. You must be some of the most miserable people in the world.The characters were developed a bit weakly now that I think about it, but I was already familiar with the history of this battle, so I was able to overlook it.As to any major grips, the only one I can come up with was that with all of the blood flying around, it is amazing that it never ended up on the Spartans.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

What a movie should be!,"This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Every single performance was superb! Gerard Butler's portrayal was both intimidating and intense yet loving and compassionate as the Spartan king. Lena Headey was such a strong woman to balance off of Butler's character. She was the perfect match to stay home and ""hold the fort"" so to speak. Each person was amazing in this movie.

Brilliant!,"In the past few years epic sagas was a bit in the background and disappointing. From Alexander to Troy to Kingdom of heaven. All done by renowned directors and huge budgets.Here the line of sagas takes a turn for the good. Different from the other epic movies of late, the director, Zack Snyder is a new-comer to epics and film direction in general, with only popular movies like Dawn of the Dead under his directing belt. This is an absolute directing masterpiece and shot beautifully. The colours focused on are of passionate and sexual nature (Crimson Red and bright yellow) which contributes to the atmosphere of the movie immensely.The storyline is brilliant and the focus points of the history is well explained and interpreted.The acting parts are brilliantly portrayed and, in my opinion, a lot can be expected from Gerard Butler in the near future.This film is good entertainment all round. Fun to watch. Interesting to see how they interpret the Battle of Thermopylae and something to talk about afterwards.A must see for any filmfanatic!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Surprisingly good,"My wife and I watched this with a cynical eye, fully expecting a video game writ large. While there was an element of that we were both surprised how involved we became in the story and action. My wife said(after the first battle) ""Its going to get tedious now!"" But she was hooked from beginning to end as the director cleverly sidestepped that trap. The film looks superb and the acting is pretty good. Butler as the king makes up for the lacklustre performance in Phantom of the Opera and is convincingly macho. I understand the cast spent a while beefing up for their half-naked roles.It is occasionally quite erotic in scenes involving Butler and the beautiful Headley (as well as homo-erotic). The battle sequences are beautifully staged and while bloody, are not gratuitously gory. Kudos to all involved in this. I am watching ""The 300 Spartans (1962)"" on TV this afternoon. I saw it as a kid and thought it was great. It will be fascinating to see the treatments side by side almost 50 years apart!!",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Life as a comic book king...,"When you see a Warner Brothers film, 99% of the time, you know how you feel about the film within about 20 seconds. Warner Brothers just about always change the logo's colour design depending on the film. 20 seconds into 300, I was ecstatic. The logo, in front of the dirty, cloudy sky looked beautiful. 20 seconds later, an old man stands holding a baby. He looks like the kind of guy who should be playing Moses. A gravely (yet distinct) voice begins talking about Spartan rituals. Basically, you have to be a really hard bastard from the point you're born. Or you're thrown from a cliff. As a baby.Suddenly, the camera drops about 30 feet and you see the ground below the cliff is littered with skulls. Very small skulls. This really is a film that isn't afraid to cause controversy. From this point in, we follow the growing up of future King of Sparta, Leonidas. Not once does the film drop its pace. Whether beating the living shite out of another warrior trainee or fighting a wolf, this film knows how to keep you on the edge.Just when you think the film really can't get much cooler, it starts introducing characters that will not only stay with you until the end of the film, but as long as you remain a lover of ultra-violence. Other than King Leonidas, you have Queen Gorgol, his wife. Very wise and happens to be the only speaking female character within the film. Dilios; the narrator is very passionate about fighting. Other than narrating, he does very little for the first half of the film but has a crucial role towards the end. Ephialtes; This deformed Spartan outcast is a hunchback and an example of what inspires 'beautiful disgust' which I'll come onto in a moment. King Xerxes; In short, he's the baddie but he considers himself to be more of a deity than a king and tries to use his powers to tempt people.Throughout the film, just about all the background is CG'd in. I'm not a massive fan of CG but like Sin City, 300 makes perfect use of it. The backgrounds are never anything short of astounding and throughout, I found myself wondering whether I should admire the action or the background. Similarly, because the film plays about with mythology a lot, there are some great horrendous beasts in 300. But unlike films such as Harry Potter or Pirates of the Caribbean 2, 300 manages to create these great horrific creatures, but still make them seem absolutely beautiful to watch. There is not a moment in this film that is dull or ugly. Everything looks perfect.Finally...the fighting. What can one say? It's a huge let down... ... Just kidding. The violence in this is absolutely spectacular. Remember thinking Kill Bill was crazy? Then this is the film for you! The action is immense. Perfectly rehearsed and choreographed violence, mixed with great acting to make it seem as if it's unexpected make the action scenes in this film some of the best ever! The editing takes a very unorthodox style that works uniquely. As King Leonidas runs through battle the action has been slowed down to basically make everything seem really cool. Then suddenly, as an opponent comes into view, the action speeds up really fast. Rather than draw back, slice, blood splatter, carry on running...it's all a case of running, death, running, death, running, death. A 45 second steadicam shot following a soldier suddenly becomes a 3 minute blend of hyper violence and gore. Throughout this film, very little real fake blood was used. It's mostly all CG'd in. It creates an effect similar to that in Sin City: the blood is obviously fake but looks remarkably pretty. In comparison to the obese amount of death, the amount of CG'd blood is just about right. The editors weren't generous. Nobody said ""This will be the goriest film ever"". They made it the most violent, but not the goriest. And for that reason, it seems 300 stands above other films that seem to attract teen audiences because of the obscene amounts of violence. 300 retains it's dignity, because it has no problem mixing fact with fiction, mixing depth with stupidity, and mixing fun with utter drama....Screw it, if you're reading this review, you don't really care about any of this.

300 - 294 = 6 Well earned stars,"More arrows than Robin Hood. More slushy sword slashing than Kill Bill. And more underrated than expected of the critics who balanced it firmly on the halfway mark. It may not live up to Snyder's most recent graphic novel adaptation but it's a should-be-3D action epic that kicks with an extra 'This is Sparta!' Unlike the diplomatic and looming dilemma his Watchmen adaptation cast over the film like a suffocating tyrant of grim news of nuclear war, 300 takes the less radical and more hands on approach to their strenuous problem of how to save Sparta from the impending threat of Persian destruction.Gerard (Butler) and his small squadron of loyal and ridiculously muscular soldiers embark to act before their advantage of leaving the village for the safety of women and children gets the better of them. It doesn't delve too much into the political side of the war (not sure about whether the graphic novel did) especially when there are throats to be cut in ferocious but terrific style.The backdrop to the massacres while being so blatantly beautiful not to be CGI, it's a rare sepia-esquire fa√ßade showing the times they are fighting in, such as the lesser impressive beige colours in Gladiator or the T.V. series of Rome. However, ironically the heavy handed use of CGI can often make the film feel overcooked and lacking humane substance to such an inhumane film (not that I was expecting lengthy sessions of mourning for their slaughter or many layers of depth under the visuals).Definitely a visual treat, particularly the slow-mo scene which terrifically isn't like anything on screen ever seen in a film, in spite of slow moving murder being a common screen spectacle.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Blood,"This is just an awesome film. It combines the feel of a video game with the realism of cinematography and the fascination of ancient history. Gerard Butler is outstanding as King Leonidas of Sparta, a warrior, a husband, a poet, and a king.The bloody action is incredible, with heads chopped off, arrows and spears piercing every organ of the body, and all the majesty and paraphernalia of ancient warfare, including elephants and a rhino and monsters and a hunchback traitor and shields massed together in the phalanx formation. The well-known story of the decisive heroism of the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae in Central Greece in 480 B.C. against the invading Persian hordes of Xerxes is explored in detail.The male bodies are well-developed, as Spartans should be. Their attitudes toward warfare and freedom are also full of definition. War is seen as a chance for glory and beauty, even in death. And, the death of the 300 Spartans offered Athens the time to prepare for the naval battle of Salamis during the following month, which forced Xerxes to retreat back to Asia.Warfare in this film is shown to be an artistic exercise, in many respects. And, Homer would have been proud to endorse this film, which combines many of Homer's themes of warfare as found in the Iliad. Finally, perhaps freedom is not ""free,"" but rather simply the consequence of sacrificial heroism in the face of almost overwhelming odds, a feast of patriotism, warrior skills, and death.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

300 against millions¬Ö I like these odds!,"First and foremost, ""300"" sadly is one of them films for which all the highlights already featured in the trailer. All of Gerard Butler's aggressive speeches (""Madness? This...is...Sparta!"" or ""Spartans, tonight we dine in hell!""), and all the Spartans' monstrous opponents simply aren't exciting anymore, since theaters have been playing the trailer since December 2006 already. Sure there are other encouragement speeches and other, less extravagant enemies to battle, but it's all pretty tame compared with what the trailer promised us. This is rather unacceptable for a hugely promoted epic blockbuster like ""300"". Cinematic events like this should be a non-stop series of excitement, spectacle and they should feature so much action it couldn't possibly fit in one trailer. Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"", for example, was a film that featured a constant level of adrenalin-rushing footage, and the trailer only served as an appetizer. Other than that, ""300"" is a pretty remarkable and visually impressive movie that'll certainly appeal to all fans of savage macho-behavior and slow-motion dismemberment sequences. Hollywood recently discovered a new prodigy and they're already exploiting all of his works. The unique style and giant success of Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" immediately resulted in a screenplay-adaptation of the man's other graphic novel ""300"", which revolves on the historical battle of Thermopylae, where a small army of 300 Spartan warriors defended their land and heritage against literally millions of Persian soldiers under the command of the greedy and self-declared demigod Xerxes. The Spartan king Leonidas encourages his troops, who were all raised as relentless fighting-machines, never to surrender and to give their lives for Sparta. Even though is a thoroughly unfair battle, Leonidas and his men nonetheless manage to seriously deplete Xerxes' armies. I don't suppose Frank Miller's outrageous depiction of this battle counts as an accurate history lesson ¬ñ unless the Persians really did recruit mutated monsters and giants as soldiers ¬ñ but it's a vivid image of ancient barbaric warfare. Fans of shiny biceps, muscled torsos and really loud yelling will have the time of their lives and they certainly don't have to bother about the racist portrayal of literally every country that isn't Greek. Exactly like in ""Sin City"", the actors simply had to pretend to fight in front of blue screens and the decors as well as the scenery only got added afterwards. It seems like this is becoming a new trend in cinema, because it increases the idea of watching a comic book that comes to life. It's not very realistic or convincing, but it offers the special effects team a wonderful change to experiment with surreal and grotesque tableaux and optical illusions. ""300"" is pure testosterone-driven entertainment, you just know to look for intelligent dialogs in this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Spectacular Movie,"Usually, a movie is good because it has a good story line and good acting. This movie adds another dimension - art. Although 300 is a spectacular movie on the first point alone, the art aspect is so absolutely amazing that it has to be mentioned.1. Plot/Acting - the plot of this movie is not unique. 300 against many. But, 300 takes that storyline and makes it its own. You get unique character development, plot twists, and unique battle sequences. That being said, it is a movie about war. There are a lot of battle scenes. The movie is not overly bloody and violent to the point where it becomes grotesque or distracting, like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but there is plenty of blood and violence. The acting is good. There were never any parts of the movie where the acting was lacking or the bad acting was distracting. The acting was convincing and led into the great character development.2. Art - Chances are, you've seen a trailer or pictures from this movie. The art design and rendering is absolutely amazing. The whole movie is a piece of art. It's like 1 billion carefully created painted masterpieces made into movie film. Every scene is amazing. There is some cgi, but it is done really well and it does not dominate the film like you see nowadays. The creatures/mutants are great. The colors play a good role in this movie. The Spartans have dark red cloaks and it just looks really cool on the back ground of the battle scenes and the sunsets. Sparta and the Greek buildings are done really well.I also want to address some of the negative comments that have been left about this movie. When I got home from the movie theater, I immediately checked IMDb to see what rank this movie got. For the first time in my life, I could not imagine anyone not giving a movie a 10. I was surprised to see that it was only about 8.5. I checked the negative comments to see what the people who didn't like it were saying. Once I read the comments (they all hit the same couple of topics), it all became clear. There are a few main issues that people have with this movie.The first is the alleged gay bashing. There are I think two references to gay people. They are both derogatory. They are both made in the context of something like, ""I'm glad we have solid soldiers on the field and not those gay philosophers from Athens."" First of all, without ever addressing whether that is appropriate to say or not, this is a statement made by a general and a king from Sparta, probably the most testosterone driven society in history. Secondly, if you were going into battle, who would you rather have at your side? A gay philosopher or a Spartan? I'm not saying that being gay makes you weaker, but empirically, gay people are more effeminate than straights.There were also a few related comments about sexism. There are a few moments where the politicians make comments about how the queen should stay out of the political affairs because she is a woman. First of all, it is believable that that is how politics was run back then. Some cultures still believe that. Is there anyone out there that can say that it is a coincidence that in the last 200 years, all of the US presidents have been men? Imagine how it was almost 3000 years ago in villages and tribes. It is no more offensive to depict women as having no say in politics 3000 years ago, as it is to make a movie about slavery 200 years ago. That's just the way it was. No one is saying that is the way it should be now, but they are just depicting the way it was. Secondly, The queen is given a very powerful role. The king respects and loves her and seeks her advice and listens to her as do the other politicians. This was the dumbest argument I saw.The next argument is that this movie depicts Iranians in a derogatory light. This is absolutely ridiculous. It's a movie about one side against the other. The Persian army was huge and to make the movie more interesting, they created strange creatures/soldiers from the opposing army and there were myths about the sorcery of the Persians. I cannot imagine one person walking out of 300 thinking, ""Man, I sure do hate Iranians more now."" It's just as ridiculous as saying that the movie the Ten Commandments paints present day Egyptians in a bad light. Everyone knows that Arabs had a great culture back then and that they invented a lot of things. Baseless argument.The next argument is that this movie is not historically accurate. This is also a stupid argument for one reason: it's a movie. If there were a disclaimer in the beginning saying, ""This film is meant to educate you about actual events,"" then the whining might be better understood. But, 300 takes something that happened a long time ago and puts a unique spin on it and adds a few interesting characters and plot lines to create a 2 hour feature film - just like Tombstone, Braveheart, and Ten Commandments. Who cares if things actually happened the way they are depicted in the movie? I can't imagine anyone expecting this movie to accurately depict history.The next argument is that this movie is politically based and represents America's war on terror against Arabs. They were really digging from the bottom of the barrel to make this argument. No one thought that about Alexander, so why do they think that about this movie? It's ridiculous.Overall, this is a spectacular movie. I can't wait for the behind the scenes footage.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
I really loved this movie!!!,One of the best movies that I have ever seen! And I really know movies since I have seen over 10000 and I know what I am talking about. First thing is the acting. This movie has an all star cast. The actor who played King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) is an absolutely wonderful actor. He will go on to be famous. The camera work was just as good as the acting also. A lot of the movie is CG but you can hardly tell and it doesn't take away from the movie watching experience.

I am half Greek but one would say that living in Greece would make you biased against the film, Greeks today do not live up to the past standards. However, the film made me feel very proud and was a pleasant change to the usual Athenian democracy and philosophy which is always mentioned throughout Greek history. Excellent battle scenes, superb actors/actresses and fitting music. The colouring was also extremely suiting and gave a perfect impression of the world in those days compared to the scenes from other movies such as Troy etc. I couldn't have asked for anything more:-)The only thing I was a little disappointed with was the love scenes, the filming of them seemed a little funny...Apart from this I could not fault the film for anything else.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Gory Glory Glorification,"300 (2006) *1/2'300' has earned itself a fairly hefty reputation among the movie going masses as a very good film. I can see why so many people enjoy it. It is action packed, satisfying to blood lust, and it's the kind of rah-rah film that the masses love. And not to step on the toes of the public and insinuate that stupidity and ignorance are beyond common expectations, but I have to wonder seriously about the depth of the mass public's sense of morality.300, based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, follows the Battle of Thermopylae (the hot gate) through King Leonidas (Gerard Butler). We begin at his birth, where the narrator cheerfully describes that had he not been in good birth condition he would have been tossed among the carcasses of other less than perfect children. The massive army of Persians come to Sparta and tell them that they must kneel to their deity Xerces or be destroyed. Of course, Leonidas kills the messenger and declares war. On being denied permission to go to war by the freakish oracles (who are as we are told traitors to Sparta) Leonidas puts together an army of three-hundred and there is our movie.My problem with 300 is not its constant graphic violence. My problem is not with the films near relentless pretentiousness. Nor is my problem with the constant stupidity of 300. My problem is the unique combination of these elements which 300 creates into a complete glorification of violence with a dash of racism and a hint of fascism.The film's visual style and flair allow for some beautiful imagery and astonishing sights. There is no arguing that arduous labor went into creating 300 for the big screen. Zak Snyder shows that he is a good director (His remake of Dawn of the Dead was a very good film, especially considering its material and what it had to live up to). That the film is well made does little to save it from itself in the end. The dialogue is incredibly poorly written, with more cheese than a mouse could stomach. It's pretentious to the point of preposterousness, and preposterous to the point of pretentiousness. When the characters aren't talking about the glory of slaughtering, a narrator does it for them.300 is essentially nothing more than a feature length portrait of sado-masochistic macho porn on a multi-million dollar budget. It's an offensive film that revels in its violence not to disgust us by it, but to enthrall us with it. Its violence is so stylistic that it can hardly be described as offensive, but it is in how the story feeds off it like the life blood that bacterium suck from a host. The heroes of the movie, all extremely buff white men (since apparently ancient Spartans had ready access to anabolic steroids) go around slaughtering then reminiscing about how great it was to slaughter their enemy, all of whom are either Arabs or freaks, save for one white traitor.300 defenders will surely attempt to draw parallels with other violent epics such as Braveheart, a film that dealt with essentially the same theme. My response to those defenders would be that films like Braveheart never glorified its violence but repulsed in it - violence was a consequence of the plot, instead of plot as a consequence of violence. It also never separated its characters by race or grace.300 is so well made that its rather unfortunate it hasn't the legs to tread water in its sea of moral repugnance.1.5/4",,Anonymous,Action
Overrated,"This movie has lots of historical errors which might incur unjust prejudice.For example, the social structure of Sparta was based upon slaves. It's hilarious to watch them babbling about freedom.Persia was far from barbaric or demonic. Actually, Persia was much more advanced than Sparta. And it was Greece which assaulted & provoked, in the first place.But that was not what bothered me most. It's based upon a comic book, after all.It was the dull plot and awkward narratives that annoyed me.Yes, the action scene is stylish and beautiful. But that's all. Actually, the action sequences even get a bit repetitive. I expect more than that from a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
What about Pericles?,"This movie is about a great story, effectively told and acted. Gerard Butler is impressive as Leonides and the special effects add to the drama associated with one of the great moments in military history. What the Spartans did was remarkable, their sacrifice profound and their legacy not forgotten. Bravo for this movie, an outstanding cinematic accomplishment.The Battle of Thermopylae is one of the major events in European history and the victory of the Greeks over the Persians was a truly momentous event, not only for Greece but for world history. The movie is about heroism, determination, and sacrifice. Ancient Greece is associated with the glory of Athen, with its Parthenon, and great political and cultural leaders, such as Pericles, but Sparta had its moments too and this movie is about one of those moments.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Visual Spectacle,"'300' uses amazing visual effects to make you think it's a meaningful and poignant film. But rather, its heavy stylized action covers up its lack of emotional resonance. It is what it is, a visual spectacle. It won't change the way films are made, and it's not the best film of the last decade. What could have been a modern epic is hurt by poor direction and choppy editing. Staged and intentionally over-the-top, '300' is captivating yet underwhelming.When the Persian Empire threatens the Greek state of Sparta, King Leonidas defies law and order when he leads 300 of his bravest men against the mammoth Persian army of one million. Though in the face of unwinnable odds, Leonidas and his men stand strong in the face of death, refusing to admit defeat and give up hope. They fight with dignity and die with honor, while Leonidas' own decision to lead his kingdom to war divides his homeland. And through the actions of these few fearless soldiers, an entire kingdom will be inspired to rise up and fight for what they believe is right.If '300' succeeds at one thing, it will surely hypnotize you with its stunning landscapes and visual effects. Filmed entirely on green screens, it allowed filmmakers to create a unique and magical world with oracles, hunchbacks, ravenous wolves, unworldly creatures, and breathtaking cinematography. No doubt, it's the film's true stroke of genius. Yet above all else, what '300' promised us above all else were unforgettable and mesmerizing battle scenes. And despite all the visualization the film provides audiences with, the war sequences fall short. While there's enough blood and detached limbs to satisfy most, the over-stylized, slow-motion capture is problematic. It prevents you from seeing much in the way of fighting at all, when a short clip is stretched out for what seems to be an eternity. Entertaining to watch? Yes. But when 'Return of the King' and its mind blowing battles keep coming to mind, we all know who wins that match-up.'300' strives for epic status, but with a script and direction that's riddled with problems, you can see how '300' falls short of greatness. With a script that's better at giving us prepared one-liners than a story with depth, director Zack Snyder (2004's 'Dawn of the Dead') struggles when he attempts to make '300' a film with relevant political undertones. In between battle sequences, which are numbered to begin with, the dialogue and dramatic elements drag. And so we're left with a very choppy film. Gerard Butler does a fine job in the role of King Leonidas, whose body alone looks like a god. Rodrigo Santoro, who plays Xerxes, the self-proclaimed god and leader of the Persian empire, gives an interesting yet impressive performance. Though for the most part, the majority of the cast consists of B-level actors. The slim script and story doesn't require much from their part, and they seemingly take a backseat to the film's eye sex.While '300' is no masterpiece, it's a film worth experiencing in theaters if only for its visual assault. A TV screen just won't do it justice. It's a classic example of style over substance, and in this case, style is all '300' has going for it. But it's just enough, even when the film lacks in almost every other department. '300' succeeds mostly at what it sets out to do, and will probably cause many to tap into their inner alpha male. Your eyes are certainly in for a treat, just be sure to check your brain at the door.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Visual masterpiece,"If you go for story an historical accuracy then you will be disappointed, if you see for pure epic battle. It WILL NOT DISAPPOINT",10.0,Anonymous,Action
A Visually Violent Fantastic Film!,"Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, ""300"" concerns the 480 B.C. Battle of Thermopylae, where the King of Sparta led his army against the advancing Persians; the battle is said to have inspired all of Greece to band together against the Persians, and helped usher in the world's first democracy.Visually, the movie is obviously one of the greatest in movie history, in the vein of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. The action scenes are very well done with the camera-work and has decent special effects. One very good visualized scene is of a woman doing this ritual with smoke and see-through clothes. I got to say, it was pretty very beautiful and mesmerizing.Even better is the storytelling. The story and script of the film is fantastic! The acting by Gerard Butler and Lena Headey are very good. This is actually my first epic film I've ever seen. I still want to watch others like Gladiator, King Arthur, Kingdom of Heaven, Troy, Alexander, and so on. I was pleasantly surprised that the film was very good, one of the year's best so far!I got to admit that the beginning starts off a bit slow. All the action the trailer promises are seen later in the film but you'll get used to it. I thought this was already overrated before seeing this movie but it's not. One thing I was annoyed by were the constant creatures getting larger scene after scene, like a snowball effect. One small creature gets killed and then there are two slightly bigger creatures and then so on and so on.At the end of the film, I wanted to applaud but I didn't want to cause disturbance, especially this one guy who clapped every one or two scenes as people laugh at him. This is an amazing film to watch. Of course the breathtaking CGI and camera-work would worth your ticket to see this movie but the great storytelling is just a great deal!",7.0,Anonymous,Action
PURE gold!,"This is a movie for the century. I was amazed when i saw this, i mean i was expecting a pretty good film. But once i left the movie theater, i was astonished, by the cinematography, and acting in this film! I have always been a fan of frank millers creations: sin city comics and movie, and 300 comics and the movie! Sin City was one of the best films i have ever seen on a decade, so i knew from the start of 300 that i would enjoy it. I mean Gerard Butler is the perfect actor for the King, King Leonidas! The action in the film was awesome. ! know this sounds cheesy but, come on there should have been more blood. But to me that doesn't really change my opinion. So i recommend this film for everyone, you will not be disappointed at all, you will be amazed! Take it from me...this film is PURE gold!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Didn't like the 300?,"Neither did I after my first viewing. I had just come of watching This Film is Not Yet Rated on DVD, and I was a bit jaded for gratuitous violence.300 is a fairly decent film I've decided. What it lacks in the quiet dramatic passion seen in Heston-style historical films, it makes up for in visual acuity and battle sequences which speak volumes. You become aware quite quickly what it means to be Spartan, and when that is taken in the context of a world in which 'Conqueror' is more than a WOW handle, it soon becomes apparent that violence is also far more than an ingredient which the MPAA rarely chastises with NC-17 ratings. It is the 300. It is Sparta. And that makes it relevant, not gratuitous. Which is why I realized the 300 isn't the mediocre film it is being made out to be by people like myself.I advise whomever reads this to do as I did not: Go watch 300, but check your preconceived notions at the door.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
300,"This was a phenomenal movie from beginning to end. I truly loved everything about it, the graphics, the backdrop, the clothing, the actors and actresses, of course. I am a big movie fanatic, book reader and writer. I have written and published a few books and also one screenplay so far and working on the second one. The experience I felt watching ""300"" is what I want reviewers to feel as they are watching my movies. God gives each of us gifts and everyone who shared in this experience of 300, I must say, is talented. This creation was carefully orchestrated, from the Kings childhood to his death. I was moved to the fullest. I cried, laughed, I felt sorrow and pain but I was also overwhelmed with the courage displayed by the King, Queen and soldiers who fought to their death. This had a very spiritual impact on me. I don't know if that was in the plan of the director but God's plans are never altered. When people see this film, they will leave knowing the power of God and how He equips one not only on the battlefield, but in life period. Kings will be put into difficult situations but they must stand, and fight for something, lest they will fall. That goes for Queens as well. They have to be strong and stand firm on what they believe. We are virtuous beings and God created us equally but we must stand and let Him be ruler over our destiny or else, the enemy will defeat us and our purpose here. ""300"" was one of the best movies of the year for me, thus far and I plan for my first movie ""3 Men I Chose to Love"" to impact society in such a way as this, that one will truly know the power of God once they've watched the blessings unfold through our work.www.alycecthompsonbooksinc.com www.myspace.com/alycecthompson",10.0,Anonymous,Action
A different point of view of that story.,"This movie is beautiful, has incredible visual effects, a not really complicated plot and really fantastic battle scenes, if someone loses it's head, it'll show exactly the head falling from the body and hitting the ground like a soccer ball. ""If you want blood, you're welcome to join us"", said Leonidas in the movie, and it's quite like that.People mostly describe it as a spectacle of blood and action, with really fantastic visual effects and a lot of clich√©s as dialogues. I don't think this movie is quite like that. You can really tell the whole story of the movie in 3 lines if you wanted, yet, this movie is not so empty as they say. It's not because it's very simple and plain, that it's meaningless.I think, this movie has a message and it's something very deep.When the Persian empire comes to Greece with it's huge wealth and military power, threatening the Greeks with annihilation or submission, most people will just get afraid and think of a way of escaping from being destroyed by becoming subordinate of the Persians, even through for the Persian empire, being subordinate means becoming a slave. Even through their leader is nothing short of a tyrant, people will not only abdicate of their freedoms for their lives, but they'll try to benefit from that greater wealth and become corrupt.That's what everyone does, not only in this movie, but everywhere. The easier choice always prevails. It's easy to just stay and do nothing, it's easy to be corrupt, it's the easy path, becoming an ally of the Persian empire.That's reality, that's what happens everywhere, all the time. The easier choice is leaving all that's right and becoming corrupt for the sake of your own greed. Yet, in this movie, someone, knowing it's impossible to win, will fight to the death to preserve what they believe it's right, even if it's a war of 300 against a million. There's examples of that in the movie, the Ephors, Theron, the council and others versus the queen, Leonidas and the three-hundred soldiers.The entire world around you becomes corrupt, a great power it's about to take over everything, meaning it's the end of your lifestyle how you are used, so you'll just low your head and accept it? Or you'll stand with the few who won't accept that even if it cost you very much?What's the ""glory"" they keep talking about? It's just a matter of pride? Or it means that glory, it's defending what you believe, to the end, even if you die for it?This point of view it's different from everything I've read about this movie and it made me think a lot about things I've been doing recently in my life and what other people having been doing too.This movie it's not empty at all.And people should be careful about not becoming biased by critics opinion and so-called experts when watching this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

"A poor mans Braveheart, lord of the rings or gladiator.","quite simple....this film is a Braveheart, Gladiator and Lord of the rings rip off.. those films (all brilliant epics) all had amazing battle type scenes and also had a lot of emotional attachment to make you care about the characters.300 Has great fight scenes also but has zero emotional attachment, its like a video game as many have said, great to look at but you end feeling empty.Its entertaining but isn't a classic.on the positive side i thought Gerrard Butler was brilliant, possibly a future James bond.Also the guy who from lord of the rings is good as well, probably the most likable character...problem is with epics you really need them to be 3 hours so you can develop the characters and create an emotional attachment with the viewers.Overall watch braveheart, gladiator or lord of the rings again instead",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Awesome entertainment,"This movie blew me away but I warn you - it's not for everyone. The violence is glorified and bloody and the machismo is over the top. But I liked it -as a former US Marine I identified with the military culture and warrior bravado ¬ñ it was fun and made me cheer. Very few movies make you want to shout out loud these days. . All the homophobes who are critical of the movies portrayal of the Spartans need to grow up. The women were no less toned and attractive so what's the big deal? First off, it's a movie and doesn't claim to be an accurate history lesson. Second, the whole purpose of the movie is to entertain and visually please with photography, images, costumes, etc. On that level, this movie succeeds wildly. All this movie inspired me to do after watching its scantily clad actors was to go work out. Being in my upper 30's and married I realize a body like that takes a lot of work and should be appreciated.This is a niche or genre movie that lovers of fine artsy films will probably hate. The plot is...well, there really is no plot. The acting is over the top and the images are enhanced. If you like artful, choreographed violence, stunning photography and visual images, and movies that glorify the warrior culture ¬ñ you're in for a real treat. I look forward to the DVD with features and maybe even a directors cut. My biggest regret was having to watch this movie on a small 19"" screen with a mono-speaker. This movie has huge presence and I hope IMAX brings it back for a second or repeated screenings.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

It's always refreshing to see the film medium pushed to its limits as in Sin City, The Matrix and other groundbreaking movies. It's encouraging for movie-goers to know that a director is feeling for every boundary to give them the best a story can offer as was done with 300.The Cinematography was flawless, some scenes literally took my breath away. The Direction was tight with all the seams invisible unlike other epics. The cast; Brilliant, a new God has been found in Gerard Butler and I gladly worship. The script was impressive and faultless, Who came up with those lines?? The intensity of this film is breathless, it just doesn't let up. The artistry is something extraordinary.

Neither as Great nor As Awful as i could have anticipated,"I have been keenly awaiting this movie since i first saw the trailer for it a few months back. I thought wow it's truly amazing what they can do with cgi and it also looks pretty cool i'll definitely check that out.I went to 300 tonight trying not to keep my hopes up as i could easily be disappointed but what i saw neither amazed me or disappointed me. The special effects are second to none and are truly what carry this film they are breathtaking. The use of rock music really gets your pulse running and is very effective during battle scenes as with the breathtaking slow motion sequences. Although, if i had not seen the trailer for this movie beforehand i would have been much more absorbed in the awe of the special effects. After a while, while still loving it i had seen it all. Still quite amazing though. The acting i would not go so far to say excellent but it held up well and Gerard Butler as King Leonidas was very good at holding such a powerful role.At parts i did find myself thinking "" why did they put that in?"" "" or is that really necessary?"" but not being a fan of the comic i can't really be one to pass judgement. Ultimately this movie has all the factors to assure it's box office success : Violence,great action scenes, very good music and of course female nudity. These key factors will appeal to all teenage boys who will make the box office success of 300 soar. I thought this movie was very good, not amazing,not a masterpiece but still very good.Take it from me if your my age you will really enjoy this, I'm fifteen.Verdict- 7/10 Very enjoyable and some amazing moments make 300 a very good war movie but it does seem to be lacking a killer factor. It's problem was that it was rushed slightly and didn't leave enough time for any real feeling or emotion to set in. Despite that i thought it was very good but unfortunately it doesn't live up to masterpieces in this genre such as gladiator,etc. this is pretty much a throw away epic enjoyable but not extremely rememberable.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Rich & Exhausting...,"Sometimes it does wonders when you enter a theater with mixed expectations. More so when you don't know much about the Greeks, not that I care much about history.Well first things first. This will go down as one of the best visual treats one would ever experience on a silver screen. The frequent ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" every now on then in the crowd, goes on to prove that everyone was engaged throughout the runtime of the enterprise. The fight sequences are enthralling and anyone who is interested in the craft of movie making would understand that the crew, on as well as behind the screen shed that extra drop of sweat to get exactly what they aspired.With a war movie involving kings and queens, comparisons to past giants like The Gladiator and Braveheart is inevitable. But make no mistake, 300 is as much a thoroughly enjoyable piece of art as any of its predecessors.Do yourself a favor, watch 300 on a Sunday afternoon even if it means overlooking your backlog of errands that you have been pushing off to this particular weekend for ages now.

300 an excellent film no doubt.,"Best film of the year, No Doubt. If you haven't seen this film yet go out and see it. Its a complete cinematic adventure that you will never forget. The cinematography and score in this Sparta era film gives it an absolute mythical quality that you can only get from the intense battle sequences and the bad ass visual effects of the green screen. Yes most of the film is animated, what isn't these days, but the breath taking scenes of slow motion and enormous weapon filled structure of the film tales you back to were there was no animation. This is just entertainment at its best. This is what we go to the movies for. When I first saw previews for this movie I knew that I absolutely had to see it, and I think that's how most people felt. The uniqueness of the film could be seen just from the previews and it was known from the start as a sure thing.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"""300"" Brings Old World to New Light","The thunderous sound you hear is not the film's booming soundtrack. It is the sound of 300 Spartan soldiers marching forward to do or die for their country. This inspiring image is just a small sample of the visual feast that director Zack Snyder presents in ""300."" The film, based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, details the battle of Thermopylae in which 300 Spartans warriors stood against over 100,000 soldiers of the Persian army. Snyder's vision is brought to life by the talented cast led by Gerard Butler. The cast does not merely bring out the viciousness of the soldiers but the nobleness and dignity of fighting for and defending one's country.The country of Sparta is protected by the most skilled and trained warriors of the ancient world. When the self proclaimed god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) leads his Persian army to conquer the world, he wants Sparta to submit an offering as a symbol of allegiance. Valuing the importance that they are a free nation, King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) leads 300 of his best soldiers to battle against Xerxes' massive army. With the odds tremendously stacked against Sparta, the soldiers fearlessly fight against Xerxes' tyranny for their home and country.Snyder has a wonderful gift of storytelling. He gives the audience all they can handle and does not hold anything back to show the gore or ferocity of the battles. By capturing many of the battle moments in slow motion, Snyder gives the audience the full strength of each kill, each swing of the sword, and each throw of the spear. Another strong point of Snyder's direction is his choice of a dark colored background for much of the film's settings. This assists with setting the mood and tone of an early time in human history and furthers the ominous task at hand for the Spartans. After showing the tremendous battles, Snyder lets the audience catch their breath by reminding us there is a side plot on the homeland. However, when that story comes back into play, the audience is caught off guard as that plot is practically forgotten. In this one weak spot, Snyder would have served well to integrate the two plots better rather than going 90% battle and switching to 10% story.Gerard Butler is great as King Leonidas. He is not simply a barbaric, warrior-king. Instead, Butler presents him as loving, thoughtful, and patriotic. He shows the complexity of Leonidas when wrestles with the decision of fighting an impossible situation. Although Leonidas is a skilled warrior, he does not go to war simply because he wants to fight. He fights because he is protecting his country from a force that is threatening his land and his people. In battle, Butler shows the other side of Leonidas: ferocious, cunning, and merciless. Butler attacks his enemies with such fervor that there is little wonder why his men follow him. He instills in his men a pride that he feels of himself and Sparta that they are willing to die for their country and their leader. He does not need to say much to motivate his men as his actions are more forceful. Rodrigo Santoro really brings out the arrogance and ego in Xerxes. As Xerxes, he portrays the conviction that he is a god that it is almost believable that Santoro thinks this of himself. Santoro accomplishes this in the way he carries himself and the words he chooses to describe his actions. He feels he is kind and benevolent and it would be wise to surrender than battle a god. As Queen Gorgo, Lena Headey does not simply sit at home worrying when her husband will return. Headey is just as headstrong as her husband and her convictions are just as tough. What she lacks in physicality, she more than makes up for with his shrewdness and intelligence. The film is also backed by a great supporting cast including Dominic West, David Wenham, and Andrew Tiernan. Whether narrator, soldier, or villain, each actor leaves an impact with their limited role on the screen.Pure and simple, ""300"" is a sumptuous visual feast. Director Snyder throws in everything that an audience could possibly handle and leaves them wanting more. The writing trio of Snyder, Kurt Johnstad, and Michael Gordon supply a very straightforward script. They stick mainly to the battle sequences and do not rely on unnecessary clich√©s of motivational speeches. ""300"" is backed by an incredible cast who bring the fantastic old world to new light. By the film's end, the booming you hear will not be the soldiers marching but of your own heart pounding.GRADE:A-",9.0,Anonymous,Action

Great action film.,"With all the advertisement and hype of 300, I felt obliged to go to one of the very first screenings in my local area. I only expected a through-and-through action film, but after watching 300, I realized it was a whole lot more.Based on the historical battle at Thermopylae, 300 follows the story of King Leonidas and his group of Spartans (clearly 300 of them), as they hold back wave after wave of Persian soldiers (in the millions).The story may be simple, but what the 3 writers brought out of it (Zack Snyder, Kurt Johnstad, and Michael Gordon), and of course, Frank Miller is exceptional. The themes aren't so subtle, but for a movie like this, they cannot be. Ideas of Spartan teamwork and glory resonate throughout the entire two hours. The dialogue is sharp, smart, and will be quoted for quite some time. One of the lines that I felt stood out was one of God-King Xerxes, who says: ""Cruel Leonidas required you to stand. I only require that you kneel."" The dialogue would have been nothing without a troupe of good actors, and 300 does not fail in this department. Notable performances include David Wenham, Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes, and of course, Gerard Butler as King Leonidas. The characters they portray are powerful and charismatic - the passions they excite are appropriately over-the-top. At times though, I felt that Gerard Butler could have said things better than he did, as with these kind of films, there is a fine line between being melodramatic and overdoing it.For most people who see the movie, it would be because of the striking visuals. It is without a doubt that this film delivers in that respect. Although the state-of-the-art CGI is well on show, what I felt was most awe-inspiring was the direction and cinematography. Quite simply, it was beautiful.The costumes and props were vibrant and fitting. The CGI polish improved it five-fold.Zack Snyder has come from no where to being up there with the likes of Peter Jackson and ""Lord of the Rings"" and many of Steven Spielberg's movies. I cannot tell you any single shot that caught my eye, only because it would detract you from many of the other great ones. But rest assured, you will admire at least one of them in 300.I must comment on the action sequences since people will want to know what they are like. 300 arguably has some of the best new age action sequences since ""The Matrix"". It does use a lot of slow motion techniques like the Wachowski Brothers classic, but unlike other movies, it does it with (ahem) style. If it is only for the action sequences that you go to see 300 for, then you will be satisfied.A definite must-see that hovers between being a cult hit or blockbuster classic. 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Over hyped,"To me, the biggest disappointment is when you want to like something because everybody else likes it and then you catch yourself trying something for the sake of suggestion to the sub cons rather than being honest with yourself and say that you're just disappointed.I seen this movie in two parts, one half one day and the rest the next day after and my thoughts on the movie is although I respect the Spartans for what they were about and what they fought for and also kicking much Persian tail, the story just didn't capture my heart.Perhaps I'm too used to see Kirk Douglas or some other old timer play such movies but the story and attitudes are well, when you see one, you see them all.One big negative for me is that despite all of Xerxes nasty creatures and killers, they proved no match for 300 Spartans and that's bad because I wanted to see rhino or a crazy freaky ghoul warrior maul at least one Spartan. The biggest negative however was that the whole movie was too CGI'd for me, and a movie that's supposed to be bloody wasn't bloody but digitalized so it was utter crap.I'm glad I didn't actually spend money on this in the theater or by rental.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

"300 is a visual spectacle, Intelligently employing the full potential of computer graphics, combined with a powerful story","Based on the graphic novel by master Frank Miller and directed with passion by Zack Snyder (who debuted in the cinema with the great Dawn of the Dead), 300 is a vibrant work and with a breathtaking visual, although it has some problems in its script. However, the plot here is what matters least. The filmmaker's intention - successful, by the way - is to convey to the viewer the Spartans' way of life, where war is the only honorable way of life. Snyder accomplishes this by delivering an aesthetically mesmerizing film that infects the viewer with his extraordinary fury.300 is a visual spectacle. Although it was designed to be enjoyed through the eyes, the brain should not be left aside during the two hours of projection. Director Zack Snyder's second feature is aesthetically perfect, a visual dazzle, with the advantage of having brain mass attached. Yes, because despite being based on a comic book, this one in turn is inspired by a historical fact, the Battle of Thermopylae, narrated by the Greek Herotod and which would have happened around 480 BC, that is, 300 combines the comic book appearance of Sin City with the care of Troy and Gladiator's technical predicament.Like Sin City - also an adaptation of Miller's work -, each frame of 300 is ripped from the pages of the comics and converted into a moving image by the hands of director Zack Snyder, who had already impressed everyone with his version of Dawn of the Dead (2004). Traces and watercolors faithful and beautifully emulated. Fans of the comic could not be more pleased - the transformation in the hands of the excited Snyder is practically literal, something that is only possible because Miller, who wrote and illustrated the original work, thinks the comics very differently from other professionals in the field. While a master like Will Eisner gave his panels an almost theatrical perspective, Miller became famous for looking at the work as if it were an immense feature-length storyboard. It becomes easier than for a talented guy like Snyder - who masters style resources - to load that base material and make it live in other media in such a competent way. It's fun, dizzying, with mind-blowing shots and lots of action. Furthermore, it is logical, understandable, and any absurdity presented - and be prepared, there are many of them - makes sense within the proposed context.Snyder is extremely faithful to the brutality, ferocity and aggressiveness that characterizes Frank Miller's graphic novel, using a bold and extremely stylized look for this, with explosive colors (red and gold reign throughout the film) and testosterone level at heights. Here, Snyder would begin to exercise the style that would make him so hated and / or loved: the constant use of slow motion, grandiloquent visuals, and a certain fetish in exploring the naked bodies of the actors (something that would only repeat itself in the same way in the misunderstood Sucker Punch - Surreal World). In 300, soldiers shout, hurt, maim, and see the glory in it. Snyder highlights this through his camera, always meticulous in showing the bloodiest details, where his slow motion, for many a gratuitous and unnecessary artifice, displays every drop of blood that is spilled on the floor. More than that, Snyder makes a point of highlighting the very weapons used by soldiers to achieve victory - and these ""weapons"" are not restricted to spears, swords and shields.With hyper-stylized, brutal and bloody scenes of struggle, ""300"" has a clear admiration for the belligerent momentum of the Spartans and for their motto that there is no place for weakness, so be prepared for glory - in war. Zack Snyder wanted to make a film that was exactly like Miller's HQ "", which means allowing himself to play with history and its characters. However, he himself proposes a parallel of"" 300 ""with contemporary US history. To cite 9/11 and the George W. Bush administration's consecutive ""war on terror"", the director has already stated in interviews from the time of the film's release, that ""there are strong arguments to see Bush in Xerxes"" and says the film ""evidently takes on Sparta's point of view."" It can be said that the beauty of its shape is inversely proportional to the message of its content, which with its breathtaking look seeks to sell the public a bitterly warlike and spiteful content. The film tries to legitimize all the violence that has been committed by the American government, which fights, wars, invades and kills, always in the name of supposed freedom, it is not at all difficult to identify the messages encrypted in 300.But obviously, Snyder seeks to bring unexpected reactions to the viewer, an objective that is not restricted to the use of extreme violence. Take, for example, the figure of Xerxes, played by the Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro: tall, with a cavernous voice, with a gold-plated body that is also covered with piercings and chains, eyelashes and eyebrows impeccably well outlined, the image of Xerxes causes a fascinating strangeness from the first moment of its appearance, in counterpoint to the excitement (at least for women and some of the men) that the sculptural bodies of the soldiers provoked. With his provocative images (whether of violence or of sex), Snyder creates a kind of connection between the film and its audience, who certainly reacted in some way to everything that is shown. It is impossible to pass unscathed. The director challenges the senses and goes beyond the limit of common sense to a traditional construction of narrative, all in favor of the uniqueness of the experience. And when we remember Leonidas' iconic cry (""This is Sparta!""), We notice that Snyder, in one way or another, has achieved his goal.The result is a mind-boggling ballet of stylized violence, attitude and design. It is impossible not to be dazzled by the plasticity achieved by Snyder in scenes such as the oracle wrapped in smoke, that of the Persians being thrown on the cliff or the last plane involving Leonidas. These moments, however, are not well planned and masterfully executed only in visual terms. You never saw battles like the ones in 300. The moments when Snyder accompanies one or two warriors in the fight, speeding up and slowing down the scene, are just fantastic. I vibrated as few times as I had before, ecstatic with the technique of the filmmaker, who managed to find beauty - at least aesthetics - in violence. Each scene pulsates with contagious vigor, extracting as much of the film's will as possible to throw the viewer's testosterone levels up. It makes you want to scream in the cinema with Leonidas. They are monumental battles that make the violent Apocalypto an afternoon at the playground, blood by the liters, heads cut in profusion, beautiful props and accessories, in addition to camera movements tailored to video game fans. All of this transforms an epic battle that took place almost 2,500 years ago into an entertainment tailored to the layer of the population that consumes the most cinema on the planet: the teenager.Each phrase spit out in the cinema - many of them transcribed directly from the work of the Greek historian Herodotus - shakes the cinema with a maleness that has not been seen on the big screen for decades. In fact, the effect of 300 on the public can only be compared to what must have been that of the great epics of the past. And the revolution promised by this ""neo-epic"" does not stop there. Intelligently employing the full potential of computer graphics, combined with a powerful story - one of the most celebrated battles of all time -, filmmaker and producers achieved a disturbing visual and narrative grandeur. Everything there is thought to provoke an almost primitive emotional response in the public - from the naked bodies (the sex scene between Leonidas and Gorgo is as credible and sensual as few!) To the excellent ""medieval heavy metal"" of Tyler Bates (Slither) on the trail sound, going through an energetic visual feast complete with slow, accelerated cameras, dramatic pauses and frantic editing.However, because it is about a single battle, the plot hardly develops. 300 is just a series of scenes about the Spartans defending themselves against the Persians, nothing more. Still, Snyder's show of strength and sacrifice never tires, because the next scene always manages to be even more fascinating than the previous one. Meanwhile, the characters also don't get better treatment, remaining as stereotypes. But, just as the quality of the particular scenes overcomes the lack of movement of the plot, the neglect in relation to the characters is forgiven when it is realized that the story is not about one, two or three people, but about a people. And, at the end of the film, the viewer knows these people (or, at least, Snyder's view of them) very well.300 is cinema made for the masses, and there is no doubt about it. However, it is a finished product, with great care and care, evidently superior to the mediocrity established in Hollywood. Almost an author's film, just not entirely due to the millionaire proportions it assumed. Still, it works both for those looking for carefree fun and for those looking for something more worked out and intellectually intriguing. It will not change anyone's life or the way of seeing or making movies, but it certainly serves as good entertainment for those in the process.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

The spirit of the spartan army to the audience,"In 480 BC, there was a major battle between Sparta and Persia. Sparta led by King Leonidas with his 300 troops to fight the Persians led by King Xerxes who wanted to control the territory of Greece.A masterpiece of art from Zack Snyder that has a dark, brutal, cruel and bloody impression. The atmosphere in the film is made with a dark tone that adds a sense of brutality to this film. Built with heavy, booming narration and voice, the film makes the heart beat faster. Have a nice war choreo with a model of war formations and epic swordplay action. All of that is combined with slow motion movements that add to the fierce impression. This film is also combined with a distinctive musical score so that the nuances of darkness in war are so pronounced. Overall, the film is good.Gerard Butler's performance as Leonidas gives strength in this film.

king Leonidas,"300 is something you just can't ignore when you're a guy who loves great action films. The time of the act (450 BC) maybe be ancient but it sure gives you more than solid fighting scenes throughout the movie.There's one thing that makes this one very special. The fact that almost the whole movie was shot entirely using blue-screens and green-screens is quite remarkable. But for me personally, King Leonidas played by Gerard Butler stole the show. This is truly a great character played by a great actor. Leonidas is just the kind of leader anybody wants to have in their crew. He is fearless, confident and always totally in control of the situation. His well-known quotes are like installed in your brain after seeing the movie.This is absolutely great stuff and you do not wanna miss that, right?!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Story about morality and regression,"When I first time saw this film I thought this was truly boring pointless film expect the beautiful artistic visuals. The only reason it occurred to my mind to watch the film again was the homo erotic pictures of half-naked masculine bodies. And to be honest my basic knowledge about spartan people is limited to it s warrior-culture which magnified the masculinity even to the point of homoerotism.Of course every nation under serious external or internal thread appears often to us ""civilized"" individuals as fascists society full of exaggerated collectivism and eroticised violence. As I know the story is based on a comic book and surely NOT based on the real history, as many noble descendants of the ""glorious and civilized Persian empire"" have pointed out several times here. It is a tale told by Innocent mind of an ancient soldier who believed in higher order and values of his nation...those happen to be something like freedom from external oppression and tyranny, which are considered to be justification for most ""just wars"". Emphasizing the contrast between the real warriors for liberty and the slave soldiers might appear to someone as western propaganda, because it emphasizes the favorite story of western people about their common cultural origins derived from the well known ancient nationalist racist misogynist and rather egalitarian Greek culture. But there might be also rather artistic reasons for this kind of propaganda -it s a part of the psychology of extreme conflict and regression.In Lord of The rings there is used the same kind of moral dualism when depicting the fight between the good and the evil -on the other hand there are the elves who live harmony within the nature and then there are the Saruman and Sauron who are corrupted from the lust of power.I recommend this movie for people who enjoy comics, simplicity,violence, patriotism and a quite handsome men. Persians and other honorable people should watch something more sophisticated in which real heroes are imperialists and in which the real history is told.",,Anonymous,Action
"A movie made for teenage boys, so it'll do really well on IMDb","But, hell, while it's far from perfect, I'll admit that it's a lot of fun. Put it into the guilty pleasure category if you will. It goes for the title of violentest movie ever, and I think it succeeds. Much of the movie consists of the Spartan warriors hacking away at Persian fodder, with limbs flying everywhere, with an occasional head thrown in for good measure (I was slightly disappointed that there were no entrails to be found). Sick as hell, yeah, but I think most of us have a little part of our brain left over from our uncivilized ancestry. Honestly, outside of the action sequences, the film is fairly worthless. The dialogue is overwrought and often embarrassing, with a heck of a lot of narration telling us about what it's like to be a Spartan. The exposition is lame (except for maybe the prologue ¬ñ the part with the wolf was kind of cool). The trip to Thermopylae is dull, even when we find a tree with a hundred corpses impaled upon it. And, during the battle, whenever they show us what's happening in Sparta, I was always like, ""Who the *expletive deleted* gives a *expletive deleted*! Get back to the endless slaughter!"" The movie would have worked a hundred times better if it had just been 90 minutes of straight battle, with the only pauses being the tense, dark nights between them. So, really, the movie isn't all that great. But, hell, I have to give it my recommendation. Any movie that features a decapitated head spiraling through the air in slow motion has to be worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
One of the best comic book adaptations to date...,"300 probably won't win any awards for depth, but it's a very strong, entertaining film. Whatever criteria you use to separate the genre Action Films from The Rest, use it, because you won't be deriving something incredibly meaningful, deep, or layered from 300. It reinforces the ideas of responsibility, honor, courage, in a very old-fashioned and perhaps anachronistic method which may have you in fits of either indignation or triumph... depending how highly you crave a movie that mythologizes a historical event into a pitched battle between good and evil.Leonidas and his 300 Spartans combat the oncoming hordes of Persians who have been turned into, well, flesh-eating mutants. Actually there is a mix of barbarian, exotic cultures represented as weirdly painted, antler-donning lemmings that wilt under the mighty defence of the Spartans, but their inclusion is welcome. It serves to highlight that 300 is historical fiction as traditionally was done by the Greeks - truths intertwined with dramatic license, a method necessitated by the limited media available to ancient Greeks.The Spartans go to war in very little armor. If this bothers you, don't be alarmed. You're not gay because you're watching underwear model physiques fighting. There are many more sports done by men that are a million times gayer. What is very pleasant however about the fighting is that the cuts are very few and far between, the editing preserves the integrity of the continuous fight, and it slows down so we can watch in glee as spears rend flesh, or shields smash jaws. To a hardcore action film fan, this is very important. You don't want your fight scenes edited by ADD-afflicted crackheads.There's just enough sex to remind you what the demographic is, which I think is 18 to 36 year old males. The green screens, surprisingly don't interrupt the believability of the picture and don't stunt the excitement of the fighting.The one thing that I do enjoy VERY much and is why I gave this movie such a high rating is that the film was adapted for the screen. Unlike Sin City, which comes from the same writer/director team if I'm not mistaken, 300 does not follow the comic word for word. Even though 300 the comic, with its mute protagonist and straightforward, undramatized historical perspective would be perfect just for that kind of film... the movie adds just enough dramatic license to make things interesting for people who've read Frank Miller's work, over and over and over. A good adaptation in its own right - one of the best to hit the screens yet.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Style v Substance,"Have you ever heard of a little argument called, ""Style vs. Substance?"" If you haven't, I'm afraid I cannot help you. You must stop reading now. No, seriously, of course you know the debate. In a visual world, what holds more relevance, the way something looks or what is ultimately being said? When related to film, some would argue that style can and should exist without the burden of having to show meaning, that a provocative, effective aesthetic can stand alone. Others would argue that beauty is only skin deep and that without meaning or attention placed on other areas of focus, one is left with an empty experience. In this review, this argument will be applied to Zack Snyder's 300, a film that is drawing mass hordes of people to the theatre to feast upon its blood soaked violence, based on the Frank Miller (SIN CITY) graphic novel. Included amidst these masses are my roommate, Trevor Adams, and myself. Trevor will argue for style and I will argue for substance. Trevor has a background in animation and special effects and carries with him a childhood love for comic books and video games. All of these influences lent weight to his enjoyment of 300. If you're a regular reader and you know me at all, you know that I am most satisfied by well- strung words that are given even more meaning by appropriate and innovate visuals. Trevor and I are two people with often similar views that left the theatre entirely polarized. Whereas he saw art, I saw a failed attempt.TREVOR: Truthfully, I'm not so much a fan of blue/green-screen film-making. If the recent STAR WARS films are examples of using this technology to create an entire feature, why would I be interested at all in seeing this 300 film? 300 Spartans acting in front of a screen that would later be replaced by computer graphics just didn't appeal to me as a concept. I blame the trailer for convincing me of otherwise. In its 2 minutes, I knew that this was going to become an important art film that would have to fight to assert its value. The frames are painted in a way that they create an astoundingly beautiful, living comic book. I've treated myself to reading a number of comics in the last few weeks and although the stories and dialogue make my eyes roll in a way that sometimes gets me dizzy, the drawings, color and composition keep me heavily interested and eagerly turning to the next page. 300 is no different. A single film frame can be worth a thousand words of script. The fight sequences are so strikingly rendered, I found myself at points begging for the director to slow down so I could absorb more of each and every frame ¬Ö and in fact, at times, that was exactly what he did. My appreciation of this film lies not within the 300 naked Spartans or the violence they promote that brought on the comic book geeks and raving macho WWE crowd, but rather within the frames of perfection that I was given. I was so filled with love for what my eyes were witnessing, the style became the substance of this film.JOE: It's not that I cannot applaud 300 for its innovation and effort. The framing at times approaches a higher level of art and the tonality and quality of the film are engrossing, despite the obvious GLADIATOR influence. What GLADIATOR had that 300 does not is depth, a more personal sense of urgency and purpose. Spartan King Leonides fights with passion and love for his empire but his almost entirely faceless army fights blindly alongside him. 300 spends little time establishing itself historically and even less time developing its cast past their drone status so what you are left with is a bunch of boys in battle. It is violence for its own sake and its energy is not enough to overlook the banalities of their dialogue or the ridiculous fashion in which that dialogue is delivered. Even the look wears thin. As one fight leads to another with little to no other development taking place in between, the cheaper elements of the design unveil themselves. Gimmicky monsters appear to attempt new levels of excitement and the skimpy outfits and painted-on abs of the Spartans draw attention to the film's thinly veiled intentions. 300 is nothing more than a stylized masturbatory fantasy of violence, blood and misogyny. In other words, it is pure Frank Miller.TREVOR: The story is simple in 300. It doesn't try to hide itself under any complicated military strategies, nor does it weave in any intricate politics within the Spartan government. Zack Snyder simply connects the simple dots of Frank Miller's story and then beautifully paints his colors within and around those lines. It's not that I couldn't go on and on about the elements that bothered me in this film (i.e. the Golem-like ogre character; the horribly- acted Xerxes; or the simple fact that this was based on a Frank Miller comic book), but I'd rather take the same approach I did in exiting the cinema: Focus on what I loved. No film is perfect, but there can be perfect moments. This film had about 300 of them.JOE: There are certainly a select group of film and graphic geeks, like Trevor, who will see this film with the sole purpose of devouring its visual extravagance. It is their art and I do not begrudge them of it. As far as I am concerned though, when a filmmaker spends all of his focus on one element of style and allows for so many other formal aspects to just get by on their own, you are left with a hollow shell. 300 is beautiful but beauty fades fast when there is nothing underneath.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

Pure sense of Masculinity,"300 which keeps me glued even for the thousandth time I see it (thats paraphrase). Though I feel Violence as the most immature way of dealing with conflict in the present day, I wonder how Zack Snyder created wholesome testosterone cum adrenaline gush through the male audience. It is a miraculous cinematography which is never seen before nor foreseen. Firstly, looking at the directorial aspect of the film, the first thing is to look at the dressing attire of the actors. Though sparsely dressed, it is very eye-catchy. The introduction showing the boy to warrior transformation where the boy takes a stride on the wolf, which is overtly shown as a big beast rather than an animal; the boy being beaten and trained to show no mercy puts adequate conditioning to the viewer's brain on how to perceive the mindset of the Greek warriors seen in the battlefield. The intricate thinking of the director revels throughout the film. There is a shot where the ground trembles while the king and the General were speaking. The general says: ""Earthquake"", the king replies,"" No Captain Battle formations"" tells the audience of the huge count of opponents the Greek warriors are going to face. Creating expectation is what the audience expect. Talking about the cinematography, one scene needs special mention. Right after the start of battle, the king cruises through the enemies in a single stroke killing them as he passes through. The whole shot is a single recording where the time slows down just before each kill to escalate the intensity of the king's skill in the war. It's a combined magic created by camera as well as editing. The portrayal of the king Leonidus as a pillar of strength is perfected. Though he's a king and a great warrior, he never loses his composure even when there is a heated argument.In conclusion, I'd say that film-making is all about provoking emotions and making the audience forget time and space..",10.0,Anonymous,Action
How Western Civilization was born,"I give it 10/10 not because of special effects or action or anything like that. It was really refreshing to see AT LAST a Hollywood movie in which OUR GUYS were not the EVIL ones while the other guys were not the only good, the enlightened, and the oppressed by us. It has become a tradition that everything related to our own Western Civilization is questioned and disavowed by the left-dominated world of politics and show-business. (I bet it wasn't the intention of the creators, but never mind.) What those critics fail to recognize is that IT IS ONLY THE QUALITY OF OUR CIVILIZATION TO QUESTION ITSELF. There were too many fanatically critic movies already, example being the very bad Kingdom of Heaven in which all Muslims are - of course! - so civilized - everyone to a man! The Christians - on the contrary (again: of course). As for the Thermopile battle: we owe everything to those brave men (and to many others: philosophers, rulers, law-makers, ...). We would not have the science if not the Greek's concept of truth; nor the private property if not the Roman law; nor the human rights, the abolition of slavery, the emancipation of women if not the Chrisitan concept of human being and human dignity.

Frank Miller/Zack Snyder,"I think this was the first interpretation of Frank Miller's work that I ever enjoyed translated onto the big screen. I wasn't a fan of The Spirit, nor Sin City and so on. Zack Snyder absolutely nailed this. The visual landscapes and imagery were outlandishly awesome and tantalizing, especially on the big screen.The only disappointment with this movie has been the follow up decisions from both Snyder and Butler. Watchmen was a disappointment, not because it was bad, but I just think Snyder should have lent his talents elsewhere as there was no crossover appeal no matter how hard they tried to push otherwise. Butler, on the other hand is playing completely demoralizing roles. I know he wants to be an actor but why is he choosing rom coms?Anyways, back to my original point, the smartest thing to do is to pair Snyder and Butler together again, with Miller's work.

Don't go for the dialog,"This movie is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen. Seeing it on an Imax screen certainly heightened this effect. I'm also pretty sure that almost every line from the graphic novel has been included in the film; the part of the movie already penned by Miller and Varly is exceptional. A difference between this movie and Sin City is that the stories adapted to make Sin City into a movie were chopped down a bit, as there was a surplus of material already written. For 300, the material had to be beefed up by adding a political aspect to the film and fleshing out the character of Sparta's queen. This new material is very clich√© and usually accompanied by an obnoxious score that's meant to highlight the emotional content of the current monologue. That said, I hope no one goes to this movie for the dialog. The reason to go and see 300 is to see glorious and bloody battles, beautifully shot and portrayed.

Glorious and epic comic book adaptation.,"From the makers of 'Sin City' comes Spartan battle epic 300, a lush extraordinary tale of the battle of Thermopylae. Based loosely on facts but with a liberal dash of fantasy thrown in for good measure, after all it is a comic book adaptation from the pen of Frank Miller; it is a tour de force. What this film lacks in substance it way makes up for in how it looks, the colours, the textures and the style. Gerard Butler is utterly convincing as king Leonidas leading his 300 super-warriors in to battle clad in nothing but sandals, blood red capes and leather thongs. The story is that he and his men held off a million of the Persian army, fact states about 200,000 but a million makes for a much better film. And it is in the films exaggerations that it shines, it never pretends to be exact or real, even the blood (and there is lots of it) flies around like its straight out of a computer game, disappearing before its even hit the ground. The action pieces use slow motion and a kind of bullet time to speed up and slow down the mighty soldiers actions and give every spear throw and sword swing real weight. Anyone moaning about accuracy doesn't get the whole premise that this is a movie there to entertain; if you want cold hard facts then may I point you in the way of the discovery channel. There are war rhinos, ogres with sword hands and a crazy eight-foot berserker all of which despite not actually being there are present here to full effect. There is a small storyline that runs through the film but really it is all about the action, piles of bodies, skies black with arrows, strange phantom elite ninja types and the muscle bound Spartans themselves, the last time I saw that many six packs was in the booze isle at Asda. The music adds to the atmosphere by being at times all high pitched like a dreamy choir before juxtaposing into heavy metal for some of the more rigorous fights. Sure its going to get comparisons to 'Gladiator' and 'Troy' but when you see the Persian fleet at sea its pure Wolfgang Peterson but it also comes across as a modern day epic, a 'Spartacus' or 'Ben Hur' for the video gamers and the matrix generation. It has it flaws and it has its brilliant moments that have your jaw literally on the floor. But in the end it's a bloodthirsty no-brainer that is a feast for the eyes and an exercise in what cinema is capable of with a little bit of imagination. Lots of the scenes, the final shot in particularly, are reminiscent of the kind of lavish oil paintings that hang in galleries around the world depicting these momentous battles. It is not a history lesson but nether the less it's a rip roaring ride through a war that built a legend. Far fetched and far outreaching anything else you'll see for a while it is well worth fighting to see this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
raping the history,"I haven't seen the movie yet but I read the story & saw the trailer... I don't know whether the story is true or not, but what I know is that Persian (Iranian) people have never been like what was shown in the movie (both their faces and their manners). To me (and other persians) this movie is a great insultation to our people, our history and our old civilization... I think no nation would bear an offensive insultation like this... I don't know whether our politicians would protest officially or could do something about the movie, but me and my compatriots will show our great protestation against the movie and people who made it.

This is CAKE TOWN!,"Story: Not much to say. It's the classic story of the 300 Spartans, retold in the style of the Frank Miller graphic novel. It's perfectly adequate to showcase the awesome fights and visuals. Nothing earth shaking here, but it gets the job done. CActing: Gerard Butler is one of those truly great actors that disappears into a role to the point where you sometimes don't recognize that he's the same actor from movie to movie. He is great in this movie and deserves the lead role. David Wenham and Stephen McHattie are also really good in their roles. Overall, acting gets and A.Direction: Zach Snyder is very quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. This one isn't as good as Watchmen but it's still very, very good. A friend of mine didn't like the movie, describing it as being ""very, very gay."" She was using gay to mean that it showcased lots of very pretty, muscular men acting as masculine as possible, not gay as in a generic insult from the 90's. Now, as a man who identifies himself as being a 2 on Kinsey's scale of sexuality, I don't see this as being a bad thing. Besides, there have been quite a few movies lately in which the only positive thing going for them would be lots of hot women in skimpy, skin tight outfits, so I see the pendulum swinging the other way as a positive. BVisuals: What can I say about the visuals beyond that they're truly awesome? This movie has some of the best sword play I've ever seen. The switches from slow motion to regular speed create an epic effect of showcasing just how fast these guys are moving but also allowing us to see the details of their movement. AOverall: This movie is lots of fun. It's not realistic at all and doesn't try to be. See it, unless you're a history major who would be offended at how historically inaccurate it is.

Visceral and Awesome,"The best thing about ""300"" is not the jaw-dropping visuals, not the muscle-toned heroes or the gorgeous women, nor is it the story. The best part about ""300"" is its visceral enjoyment factor. You gotta love a movie where the characters don't just kick ass and take names, they thoroughly enjoy doing it.The film is about the Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) who takes 300 of his best soldiers to hold off the Persian advance. Meanwhile, back at home, his beautiful wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Heady) is getting ready to appeal to the Council of Elders for sending more soldiers to assist Leonidas. But to that end, she has to get them to listen to her instead of Theron (Dominic West), the slimy Elder who wants the position of king for himself.The first thing one notices about ""300"" is its visuals. They're spectacular. It's like a painting come to life. The people look like a mix between real and computer generated, but the effect works. The film is highly enjoyable on regular DVD, but it's even better in HD. In his late-written review of the film, Roger Ebert criticized the film for having all the Spartan soldiers be perfectly toned musclemen. He's missing the point. This is a highly stylized film, and having them look like that adds to the visceral enjoyment of the film.The acting is solid, although unspectacular. Gerard Butler got his big break here as Leonidas. Butler is great as the warrior-king, and knows exactly how to play the character. The film is over-the-top in a very stylized sort of way, and Butler fits right in. It helps that he can scream some of the famous lines in the film, ones that are already going down in history. As his wife, Lena Heady is equal to him. She may be a female, but she's no meek housewife (as one Persian finds out the hard way). One immediately gets the sense that if she could, she'd be fighting right beside her husband. Dominic West is perfectly slimy as the traitorous Theron. Imagine the villainous alter-ego of Mark Wahlberg, and this is who you get. David Wenham is also good as the Dilios, who is also the narrator. He has an interesting voice, and it is used to great effect. Rodrigo Santoro is perfect as the androgynous, but no less menacing Xerxes.Zack Snyder has a clear knack for visuals. Even if the story was dull, which it's not, it would still be worth watching just to see the visuals. His trademark technique of slowing an image down then immediately speeding it up is used very effectively here, and while he keeps the film over-the-top, he never goes overboard.This is a very violent film, almost cheerfully so. A story like this needs to have blood, guts, and brutal finishing movies to have its effect. Thank God the studios realized this and allowed it to have an R rating. The film would have been ruined had it been neutered to anything less. It's a shame to think about how many films have been rendered inert from diluting the violence.Historical accuracy was not a concern to Frank Miller (the author of the comic book which the film is based on) nor the filmmakers except where it suits the story. The film portrays Spartan culture very well, probably because it suits the story. The training of boys into men is very true, and the Spartans were ruled by a council of Elders (although since the council was made up of men who became too old to fight, West is too young to play the character, but never mind). Also, Spartan women were given a lot of freedom, and the portrayal of Queen Gorgo is reasonably accurate. More importantly, the film's version of how Spartans viewed military endeavors was also very true. The quotes ""they were taught that to die in battle was the greatest glory a Spartan man could ever achieve"" and ""Come back with your shield, or on it"" are very true of Sparta. The Persians don't fare as well, though. The actual number of Persians who fought at the Battle of Thermopylae is debated, and there certainly weren't any of the bizarre creatures that Frank Miller dreamed up. Not that this is a bad thing...""300"" has everything an action movie should have. You want action? You got it. You want visceral enjoyment? It's here. Blood, guts, naked women and hot sex? Yup.In short, ""300"" is a thoroughly enjoyable and unapologetically violent film that every guy will love.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Pass the Cranberry Sauce.,"Overbearing, overwrought, over-exaggerated mess in the film-making tradition of ""Sin City"" and ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" as the focus is the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. where 300 Spartans tried to defend their empire against the Persians. Gerard Butler leads the titled group and David Wenham serves as one of his top soldiers in the charnel house vomitorium of violence and basic exploitation tactics that wore thin way back in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The acting is sophomoric, the direction is confusing and unclear and the screenplay could have been penned better by middle school students. Sickening movie tries to engross with action that honestly is mundane and boring. Based on Frank Miller's ho-hum graphic novel.

This... Is... Well you know the rest...,"I can't claim to be familiar with the comic book, but even without so then ""300"" turned out to be a rather enjoyable movie. Nor can I claim to have been overly familiar with the story about these brave Spartans who stood seriously outnumbered against formidable foes.It is no secret that it is the abundance of action that makes this movie good and makes it a memorable movie. The action combined with the, and lets be bluntly honest here, excessive usage of slow motion sequences. It looks good, but the second time you watch the movie the slow motion starts to wear thin.The story is set in ancient Greece, where 300 heroic Spartan warriors set out to fend off the invading Persian army consisting of well over 100,000 soldiers. The Spartans are lead by King Leonidas, a man whose courage equals his skills in combat.As I mentioned earlier, ""300"" is fueled by the sheer amounts of impressive action sequences. And it should be said that the choreography and camera-work during these action sequences is nothing short of spectacular. It is a visual display of pure warfare by the clash of steel. The storyline actually falls in second after the action sequences in my opinion.The visual department also deserve a great amount of credit for their contribution to making ""300"" an entertaining and very watchable movie. The effects are spectacular, and often makes it feel like the audience is right there on the chaotic battlegrounds.Also the props and wardrobe department really pulled their weight in this movie. There were so many nice details in the costumes, armors, weaponry, etc. It really helped to bring the movie to life and added a believable element to the movie.There is an impressive ensemble of talents on the cast list in ""300"". And the people on the cast list were doing good jobs in their individual respective roles. And the characters in the story were richly detailed and nicely fleshed out in the movie.""300"" is definitely a movie that you should check out if you enjoy action movies that are set with a historical theme. If you enjoy action movies then you will certainly not be disappointed with director Zack Snyder's 2006 movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

"A Visually Stunning, Action-Packed Epic of Heroism","Zack Snyder's 300 is a visually captivating and adrenaline-pumping cinematic experience that redefines the action genre. Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, the film tells the story of King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans, who face off against the vast Persian Empire in a legendary stand at the Battle of Thermopylae. What could have been a simple war epic is elevated by Snyder's masterful direction, stylized visuals, and an intense, emotional portrayal of heroism and sacrifice.The film's greatest strength lies in its breathtaking visuals. Snyder's use of a highly stylized color palette, slow-motion action sequences, and stark contrasts between light and shadow create an unforgettable visual experience that immerses the viewer in the brutality and grandeur of ancient warfare. The vivid, almost surreal imagery gives 300 a distinct, graphic novel-like quality, making every battle scene feel like a living, breathing piece of art.Gerard Butler's portrayal of King Leonidas is nothing short of legendary. With his commanding presence and fierce dedication to his people, Butler brings a level of intensity and passion to the role that is both captivating and inspiring. His performance drives the film's emotional core, as Leonidas is not just a warrior, but a symbol of honor, loyalty, and the unyielding will to fight against impossible odds. The supporting cast, including Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo and Michael Fassbender as Stelios, also deliver strong performances, each contributing to the larger-than-life narrative with conviction and grit.The action sequences in 300 are some of the most thrilling and stylish in modern cinema. The film's choreography is nothing short of spectacular, with every clash of swords and shield perfectly timed and framed for maximum impact. The Spartans' disciplined battle tactics, their ferocity in the face of overwhelming odds, and the use of slow-motion to emphasize key moments create an exhilarating experience that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.Despite its emphasis on action, 300 is also a story about courage, leadership, and sacrifice. The film's portrayal of Leonidas and his soldiers' unwavering commitment to their cause resonates on a deeper level, showing that heroism isn't defined by numbers, but by the strength of one's spirit and the willingness to fight for something greater than oneself. The film's dialogue is often dramatic, but it serves to amplify the sense of honor and duty that drives the characters forward.While 300 may not offer a historically accurate depiction of the Battle of Thermopylae, it's a film that thrives on its stylized, epic storytelling rather than strict adherence to historical facts. Its larger-than-life portrayal of heroism, honor, and sacrifice makes it an unforgettable cinematic experience that celebrates the spirit of warriors throughout history.Ultimately, 300 is a thrilling, visually spectacular epic that stands as one of the most memorable action films of the 21st century. With its stunning visuals, intense action, and powerful performances, it's a film that captures the imagination and leaves an enduring mark on its audience.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

100% Mantertainment,"300 is an adrenaline fueled fantasy classic! I cannot recommend this film enough to those of you looking for some hard-hitting eye candy and no-holds-barred battle action. I gotta admit I was totally blown away by the visuals in this. For a film shot entirely on a green screen, it's breathtaking. There were a few sequences that felt a bit too ""two dimensional"" for me but I truly believe 300 is a revolutionary film. There's really only been a handful of films out there that have been shot entirely green screen before and this is without a doubt one of the best in my opinion. I figure we'll be seeing more and more just like this as time goes on. Hopefully they learn to utilize the technology in a way that opens the environments up a bit more. Don't take this as whining or anything but the film occasionally felt claustrophobic.The acting in 300 was fantastically over-the-top and why the hell shouldn't it be?!! This is war baby! We get all manner of grunts, screams, roars, hissing and whispering. Without a doubt, Gerard Butler takes the cake for being the baddest bad ass from Bangor to Bangladesh! His intensity could melt a Hyundai! The second runner up for coolest mother-trucker would definitely go to Rodrigo Santoro's terrifyingly creepy turn as transvestite-ish warrior king, Xerxes.Folks, I won't bog the review down by nitpicking the he-man dialog or gay-bashing hypocrisy of the Spartans¬Öplain and simple¬Öthis is mantertainment.

A beautiful and solid epic that delivers on action and spectacle.,"A few days ago I bought the blu-ray of 300 and naturally I wanted to revisit the film that was a favourite of mine since I have seen it in the cinema. Well, younger me clearly loved it a whole lot more than older me. Read here what the thoughts of younger me were:""300"" is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen! This story based on the graphic novel is simply wonderful. The visuals are stunning. The music is great. The acting is superb. The drama is more than excellent. The action is epic. It is difficult to describe the feeling you get when you see this movie. When you look at the screen you know some things can't happen. But the way it is edited and filmed gives the impression that it is all real. ""300"" never gets boring! I never wanted this movie to end. It is a movie you can watch over and over again and enjoy every minute of it. This is a movie that should be playing in the theaters all the time. (Are you still here? Go rent or buy the movie already!).While I admire younger me's enthusiasm, older me is a little more reserved. For one thing 300 does lose strength after several viewings. It is therefore not a movie you can watch over and over again without getting bored. Perhaps it is the fact that we are spoiled even more spectacle wise and that we gotten used to bigger and better. Although I have to say that some of the visuals still hold up and look mesmerizing. Especially in HD. But to be honest it is not exactly the spectacle that I am critical of. For what it offers it's solid to grand. It's more the non action scenes that pop out more than before. Of course it is understandable that the surprise factor of many of those plot related moments is diminished. However I do distinctly remember being more involved and immersed with the main characters and the odds they had to go against. A lot of the dramatic scenes now were lacking intensity. And I think it is because the films misses some memorable dialogue and stronger dynamics. Apart from the iconic quotes:""This is Sparta!"", ""Tonight we dine in hell."", ""A thousand nations of the Persian empire will descend upon you. Our arrows will blot out the sun! Reply from Stelios: Then we will fight in the shade.""The excellent cast hide the fact they don't have that much to say or to express. Instead of showing us we are told by narrator Dilios (played by David Wenham) what the emotions are and where our sympathies should lie. Highly effective the first few times. But now after having watched the film a couple of times the cracks are beginning to show. Is this is a bad thing? No, I don't think so. Although I had wished that 300 had a little more to offer next to the action and nice visuals. Still if you haven't seen this film yet then you will have a blast since the first time watching is splendid fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

"Folks, it's entertainment, not a documentary","What buffoon seriously believes ""300"" represents real history, or real people? It's astounding that there are people so mind-numbingly dense as to feel the need to spout ill-conceived, poorly researched, knee-jerk reactions about how the movie misrepresents Persians.Understand this, people: Yes, it misrepresents them. Also understand this: It's a movie. It's fantasy. Get over it.Yeah, the ""Persians"" in the film come out looking pretty bad, I'll certainly give you that. Consider that the British often appear equally poorly in movies about the U.S. Revolutionary War. And the French come out looking bad in movies about Algerian independence, and so on and so on. I'm certain Americans come out looking pretty horrific in plenty of films. But accept that it just happens, and unless a film purports to be a documentary, it's not worth getting steamed about -- or feeling the need to come up with ""reactions"".Indeed, ""300"" is so laden with the unreal and imaginary that I can't believe people think it represents actual historical Persians. Seriously: who could possibly confuse ""300"" with actual history? Here's some help for the confused: What army ever fielded legions of horribly disfigured mutants? Or was led by a nine-foot bald colossus who spoke in deafening Surround Sound? Answer: only an imaginary one.What's wrong with the people who take real offense when the movie is so wholly a comic-book-style fantasy? I will clarify one accurately depicted concept in the movie, however: the Greeks' determination to not live as ""slaves"" doesn't refer to slavery, as such. Instead, it means they refuse to submit to a foreign power. Thus, the reference to Xerxes' army being comprised of slaves was true, according to the Greeks' point of view: the Persian army was comprised largely of conquered peoples. For example, the Medes were the first foes the Greeks fought at Thermopylae, and were the most recently conquered by the Persians.One need only read any amount of actual history to know the difference; I suggest the complainers start doing just that. And then relax.Finally, to the unfortunate buffoon who posits that ""Persia started civilization"": That's only about as true as the statement ""Columbus discovered America."" Who do you think the Seleucids were trading with along the Silk Road?

Amazing!,"The first film directed by Zack Snyder that I watch was ""300"", a film based on Frank Miller and Lynn Varley's, which is one of the comic books written by Miller ""Sin City"" and this film is a perfect example of what Zack Snyder can do with graphic novel films.The plot revolves around King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), who leads 300 Spartans into battle against the Persian ""god-King"" Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his invading army of more than 300,000 soldiers. As the battle rages, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband.Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing 300 within the genre of historical fantasy.The story stays true to the comic book and the script is also written by Zack Snyder and two other writers. The film is just amazing in every aspect for what this film is and it is cool. Gerard Butler proved that he was the perfect choice for Leonidas and it shows throughout his whole performance.David Wenham played Dilios and he does a good job in his performance and it was an amazing performance that he pulled off and I have seen him in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson. Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo in this film, she is amazing and she is fantastic in that kiss scene with Gerard Butler and she was really cool.The visuals and action sequences are amazingly well-done and death plays an important part in this feature film. It is spectacular and amazing. This movie stays true to it's source material and I cannot say more about this movie.Tyler Bates' musical score was amazing and fantastic to hear in the film and his musical score for Watchmen (which I reviewed on IMDb and appears on my Top 10 Comic Book list and Top 10 Overrated Movies list) is just great and spectacular.Overall, I love 300 and the film is just incredibly well-done and Zack Snyder and Company did a really good job in staying true to it's source material.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Action

The most macho film ever made,"Loads of people are talking about 300 right now. Having grossed over $70 million, it's already an instant smash and needless to say, I'm sure most of you good people reading this will have seen it already and made your minds up, so my review isn't going to sway your opinion one way or the other. For those who haven't captured it yet however, ignore all that talk about beautiful cinematography, crimson spattered violence and latent homo-eroticism, because what 300 more than any other film has done in the past decade or so, is play up a blood and thunder triumph as the most testosterone laden frenzy you will ever see.Yes folks, once upon a time the likes of Predator were considered tough guy movies revelling in their own machismo. Not any more. Now, thanks to Frank Miller, Zack Snyder, Gerard Butler and a bunch of buff and ripped Americans pretending to be Greeks, there is nothing more manly than 300. Not boxing, not fighting, not driving sports cars, not making love to a woman, just this. And thats all you really need to know. The likes of King Leonidas, Vincent Regan's Captain and David Wenham's Dilios are not so much characters as they are brute force driven to such an extent that it almost feels like a parody; they show no fear, slaughter their enemies with reckless abandon, long only for warrior's deaths and when crouching under their shields as a thousand arrows rain down from the heavens, they laugh with derision at their foe's pathetic humanity.As such, it would be easy to suggest that 300's audience will most likely be 14-28 year old males but in all honesty, its difficult to imagine anyone not liking this movie. The battle scenes are energetic crowd pleasing spectacles, even if Snyder overuses the slow motion a tad and with its pantheon of armoured beasts, mutant warriors with swords for fists and Persian elites who resemble the Uruk Hai more than men, the visual appeal cannot be underpinned. As these creatures suggest, 300 isn't the most historically accurate movie ever made but its certainly a lot more enjoyable to watch than the majority of historical epics I could name.In short then, a highly enjoyable piece of fiction that purists will be pleased to find mirrors the source material quite accurately. With its collection of oddball warriors, CGI blood and a soundtrack comprised of heavy metal guitar riffs, it may date badly and ten years from now be laughable, but right now its an absolute blast. Snyder may be a white, middle class geek with a camera, but having made this and the white-hot Dawn of the Dead remake, he sure knows how to deliver the goods on screen. And as for all that talk of homo-erotic subtexts, I fail to see what they're getting at.

good,"The film has good graphic effects and the action is very dynamic. I don't like the idea of monsters and other fictional creatures being involved in the film because it's exaggerated. The story is inspired from a historical legend which is quite exciting and it deserves to be exploited. Sudden actions of the characters are well played and the editing is very cool. I think they used chroma key because the image is too good and sensible to be filmed on real environment.( only Riddley Scott is that good at extraordinary images in real environment). Not too bad, not too good but too commercial... Didn't like very much the film ""Dawn of the Dead"" made by the same director. Fortunatly this is better!",8.0,Anonymous,Action
300 ......great movie in a long time,"great sound effects !!!!!!!!!great visual effects !!!!!!!!great story !!!!!!!!!great music score !!!!!!!!!!!!great costumes !!!!!!!!!!!great battles !! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!great combination (Miller & Snyder) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The only thing that was not great was the traitor Efialtis ....what else do you want in a movie !!!!!!!!!!!!Anyway my opinion on the movie is that Frank Miller did a good job giving all the glory to the 300 because they were the ones that made the difference in the Thermopyles,we all know that they had help from other armies but just imagine how long the movie had been if he had showed all the other armies and all the other facts to make the movie historically accurate !!!!!And last of all it's based on a graphic novel,must not forget that when we share are opinions .",10.0,Anonymous,Action
The Best Action Movie I've Seen in..... ever?,"A truly fantastic film if you like fantasy violence in all its Technicolour arterial red. The set piece fights must be the best in cinematic history.And what a joy to see the spear being used so well as a main infantry weapon of war, rather than the usual Hollywood reliance on fancy swords. The spear was the weapon that conquered the known world back in those days, and this film shows you why. I stand in awe of the fight choreographers.As a big fan of the more historically accurate ""300 Spartans"", ""300"" is one hell of a film that must be seen to be believed, and then seen again.

Captivating and breathtaking!,"I went to see it in the cinema due to all the hype around this film. And I can say I did not make a mistake in deciding to watch this film.Right from the first minute, the film is already very intense. The strong emotion of non-submission and the determination to fight until the last breath is vividly portrayed in every minute. Gerard Butler's heroic shouts are already enough to get my adrenaline pumping.Few films can capture my complete attention right from the start and maintain it to the end. The stylish action certainly captures my attention. The special effects in the film are stunning. In very few other films can you see such brutal and yet stylish manoeuvres. The graphic scenes of soldiers being beheaded, and limbs flying around like confetti strips adds to the enormous tension.Some say that the plot is thin. I do not agree on this. The plot is simple, as it is about the 300 soldiers' fight to defend their country until the end. However it is not a thin plot. It contains so much emotion, and highlights the humankind's determination to survive and persevere.I seldom give a 10, and I think this film deserves it.",,Anonymous,Action
Okayish if you like stomach muscles!,"Never have i been so excited by a trailer for a movie. I must have watched it 20 or 30 times in the run up to this movie. I counted the days until it was released. And after having watched it last night i find myself a little disappointed.Its a classic example of brilliant trailer editing. Good music skillfully edited with the best scenes from the movie.I just had my hopes pinned on this movie being different from all the previous letdowns because the trailer was so damn good. Once again I was wrong.Its not that the movie is bad (I enjoyed it) its just that it wasn't the nerve jangling experience (likr the trailer) I had expected it to be. I had seen all the best bits already so there was no surprises. And the best bits as i just called them looked ridiculous in the context of the movie.I read the frank miller comic a few years back (not my favourite) and thought it would make a great film. It probably would have. Why the director felt the need to fill it will elephants, giants, mutants, rhinos and bare-chested he-men i'll never know. To me the sole single story arc of a small number of men using battle tactics to slow down a larger enemy should be enough for a brilliant war film anyway.It almost seems that the ""true"" story did not have enough for the scriptwriters/directors to make a full length modern music video with and so they added a menagerie of baddies (including grenade clowns).To cut a long review short I enjoyed this movie, but nowhere near as much as I should have done. I wanted so much more after watching the trailer. I consider myself a little let down.One friend of mine was lucky enough to see it at an IMAX cinema and he said ""I've never seen a movie with more nerve jangling moments and my girlfriend cried for the last ten minutes.""Clearly his girlfriend was closer to the truth than him as she, in the last ten minutes she actually realised what twelve quid could have bought instead of this bastardised, cinematic, gay friendly, bruckheimer, cock adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
300,"It really aggravates me to see others accuse a movie of being a blatant form of propaganda, when it obviously isn't.Movies are made... and meant to entertain, and hearing that 300 is a stale movie with brittle characters and I guess what some have called a ""fascist"" message, and then there are the ones that say the way Persians are portrayed in the movie is offensive.These are people who obviously don't respect movies as the art they are. Calling a movie, ""fascist"" and exploiting the tag line of a movie just to force their own opinions on everyone else. Furthermore, in a movie... there has to be a protagonist and an antagonist, its how things have always been and always will be. In this instance, Sparta are the good guys, and the Persians are the bad guys... OF COURSE THE GOOD GUYS... are going to be made up and the BAD GUYS are going to look like beasts, its not racist, and it definitely shouldn't be thought as such. Thats like someone making a Beowulf movie and some ethnic group getting offended because they feel Grendal(besides being a monster) portrays their race incorrectly.We all know, before 300 was a hit in the box office, it was Frank Miller's graphic novel, however not all of us know before that was the movie. ""The 300 Spartans"" and yes, it was made in a different time... but I urge anyone to watch and dare them to say... its racist... or fascist, it'd be entertaining to see.I loved the newest 300, its visuals.. its story and its characters, and I was glad to see it in theaters.Thanks.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"Beyond Blood and Guts: ""300"" Fights in a Dreamscape","Imagine sitting by the fire and listening to the village elder tell of how 300 Spartan gladiators held off a million Persian invaders. Well, you don't have to. ""300"" is a campfire tale come to screen and mythologized to epic proportions.The film is an adaptation of a graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller, whom viewers might recognize as the novelist of ""Sin City."" ""300"" isn't as richly textured as ""Sin City."" It's focused more on the build up to war as opposed to the character clashes that brought an equal level of violence to ""Sin City."" But ""300"" has a very similar look and soundtrack, and more importantly, its narrative shares the same dark poetic qualities (I hesitate to use poetry, lest I conjure maladroit comparisons to Virgil or Homer) as those of the three ""Sin City"" story lines.These poetic qualities are absolutely vital because ""300"" holds no pretense to realism; it's much closer to an opera (without arias) than the dramatic naturalism found in recent films, such as last week's ""Zodiac."" There are more than a few occasions early in the film when its gross characterizations of the Persian army could've been rather offensive. The film casts audacious black men as Persian emissaries, draping them in robes and chains that might've been ripped from racist cartoon characterizations of ""African heathens"" or ""ragheads."" The Persian king, Xerxes, is the pagan devil himself, decked in odd facial piercings, eyeliner, and beads that make him effeminate even as the bass notes in his voice are artificially enhanced to seemingly erupt from the most masculine bowels of the earth.Yet because of the visual and lyrical poetic qualities, it's clear the film depicts an alternate plane of reality of the kind encountered during bizarre dreams half remembered come morning. In fact, the production notes suggest the film seems more like a dream dreamt by the narrator the night after the battle, preserving the events' emotional truths and employing facts not as objective truths, but as symbols that texture the emotion. This suggestion, to me, seems the most accurate way to view the film. And I think it counters those who'd find social metaphorical or allegorical statements supporting racism or the pros and cons of Bush's Gulf War efforts (which might otherwise be appropriate if the film were more literal).It also helps that the dream emerges as its own independent reality. Fine performances from the leads are indispensable to this end, particularly those of Gerard Butler as the king, Lena Headey as the queen, and the narration of David Wenham (of ""Lord of the Rings"" acclaim) as one of the king's best friends and fellow soldiers.There's also a distinct look and feel to the film that facilitates its independent reality. The lighting has odd and portentous contrasts. Distinct detail in the special effects carves edges into a misshapen human monster's tooth and chisels contours into the Spartan warriors' six-packs. A gritty soundtrack that fuses acid guitar rock with orchestral themes melds with the narrator's Australian accent to lend a course sense of order to the action, a Croc Dundee-like Outback fusion of simplicity and toughness. In short, the film is otherworldly.Was it a great film? No. But an enjoyable film that's remarkably consistent with ""Sin City"" and will likely be an influence on other films later this decade? Yes. And it certainly makes Russell Crowe's ""Gladiator"" seem, well, un-poetic by comparison.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"""Hey, you, what is your profession?""","First of all I must start saying this is NOT a Historic movie but an Inspired in History Epic movie! It is, as we all shall know, an adaptation of a Frank Miller's graphic novel inspired in the Greek legend of the 300 men who fought until death, under King Leonidas' orders, against thousands of Persians. So, as the movie is an adaptation of a graphic novel based on courage and bravery it acts like that, meaning by other words, it's just an epic movie that illustrates bravery, courage and glory. That's nothing else. It's inspired in historic happenings, but it doesn't follow them faithfully, it's not its intention/purpose.If we see the film by this point of view, we will find it pretty good, in spite of not being the best epic movie I've ever seen¬Ö In fact, I think there are a great number of epic movies, based in history, that are better than this one. I can remember BREAVEHEART¬Ö In my opinion was better than this 300¬Ö Anyway, 300 is definitely a good quality epic movie.On the other hand, what annoyed me the most ‚Äì and it has nothing to do with the movie ‚Äì was some comments, here on IMDb, saying this movie is Fascist, based on propaganda, racist, that terrorists and Hitler would appreciate it¬Ö OH MY GOD! From WHERE came out these people who keep saying such silly crap?!Let me just ask you something:Is it a violent movie that praises violence, rage, and hate? YES, it is.Is it a movie that discriminates the strong people from the weak, suggesting that the weaker and the disable ones should die to let the strong live? YES, it is.Is it a movie that proposes us to fight for a cause and die, if necessary, to defend it? YES, it is.Is it a movie that worships war instead of peace, ignoring the loss of 300 lives, just to claim an ideal of glory and pride? YES, it is.It's ALL TRUE! but HEY you BLIND people just LOOK into HISTORY and search for yourselves:if in the Ancient Sparta the children were not educated and military trained like the movie describes;if they didn't kill the weakest and disable ones to just maintain the stronger in order to create the best soldiers;If they weren't trained in the worst possible conditions and weren't ready to die for their land!These men were just professional soldiers, born and trained to do just one thing in their lives: fight! They had no other professions like blacksmith, farmer, pastor ‚Äì like one scene of the movie clearly portrays! No, they were warriors, just that!This film is just portraying realistically the ancient Sparta nation, so all those comparisons are absolutely absurd and without any sense. We can't look to the Ancient world with the same moral standards of our modern societies. We can't say this film is fascist just because it portrays a social behaviour (truth at that time) that nowadays we consider absolutely barbaric and salvage! The History is like that, we cannot change it! If we want to do something with historic sense we must be faithful to it, and not change it just because nowadays it's morally incorrect!About the terrorist propaganda¬Ö another one that makes me laugh! This ""western world"" in going out crazy about the terrorist issue! If this film was shot just 15 years ago nobody would say it has a terrorist message! You all are PARANOID with terrorism! Just because it shows us glory becoming from death and suffering, just because it praises the death for a cause, it's terrorist propaganda! So did BREAVEHEART, and nobody said it had a terrorist message!Other people say it's propaganda to the US army, because it shows us a gigantic force (Persians) crushing a small group of rebellions (the Spartans), and those would be the ""terrorists"" crushed by the military power of the bigger force¬Ö What they forgot is that either in History as in the movie, that Persian gigantic force (the invaders, just like the US army!) was defeated by the Greeks (the defenders of their land) ‚Äì not those 300, but the complete army ‚Äì so even here the comparisons are absolutely ridiculous!Now, back to the movie, after all is what really matters! I just loved the characterization, especially of the Persians! The King Xerxes (played by Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro) and the Persian Immortals are simply fantastic! They may not be faithful to real history but they are amazing! As I said in the beginning the characterization mixes the ""real"" world with a world of fantasy and mysticism used in the graphic novels¬Ö I think the movie was improved by this type of characterization and fantasy.Definitely, not a brilliant, but a pretty good epic movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Action
117 minutes of  pure testosterone,"I saw this movie in Imax the day after the Holland release, after being kicked out of the cinema on the day of the release. Why was I kicked out? Well... apparently they wanted to keep the 4 rows in the back empty, and didn't tell us that until the whole cinema, apart from the front row's were full... So we could either sit in front... or leave and get our money back... no one wanted to leave... they called the police, so eventually everybody in the back 4 rows left or went to front row.AND THIS IS NOT A MOVIE TO SEE IN FRONT ROW No ladies and gentleman, this is a movie, so incredibly amazing. You should see this in all it's glory, on the 5 row from behind, where I sat the next day when I saw it.The movie starts kind of slow, with a person telling how King Leonidas became king of the Spartans. And after that the action basically starts... and doesn't end until the movie is over. Apart from some tiny story parts in between.But the action itself is so amazing... It blows you off of your seat. You want to go in a killing frenzy yourself... you start screaming KILL KILL KILL throughout the whole movie, until someone punches you and you are quite again... It is... 117 minutes of pure testosteroneThe fighting choreography is done great. And the fighting combines all sorts of things you might have seen in other movies in a way it feels completely new. Slowmotion, Video starting to play faster, things like that.About the visuals: They are stunning. Apart from some downsides (The rocks Leonidas climbed on weren't convincing, i think they build those by hand to be honest, instead of CG) But the overall visuals were so coolAlso the blood they did. I read about how they do it before. And in fact it is not 3d blood, but 2d. They did that to let the movie keep the feel of the comic... and it just looks.... so..

It is indeed one of the greatest movies I have EVER seen.The people who are complaining about it not being historically correct just have to shut up. What is the point about that really?

I can honestly say that I have never seen any fight scenes like the ones in this movie. I think the cinematography from this film could forever change the way movies are filmed and edited. The only thing that could possibly be considered anywhere near bad about the movie is that this was based on the graphic novel and not what really happened. So you will have the people accepting this as truth and that is dumb, but in reality, they are dumb for accepting a movie as truth.

The mutants ruin this otherwise excellent film,"I have been expecting this movie for a long time and at first it was announced for the autumn of 2007. I couldn't wait that long and i'm glad I didn't have to. I felt thrills down my spine for at least half of the movie and some parts were really moving, breathtaking and monumental. Frank Miller is brilliant in some ways but has a few obsessions that he should, in my opinion, get rid of. I would have appreciated a lot more a pure historical film done in this manner, because the film making and the battle scenes are absolutely brilliantly done. My favorite history/drama movie is The Gladiator. If 300 had the seriousness and the deepness of that movie, it would have been the best history/drama movie ever made. If it weren't for the monsters and mutants, it would have truly been a masterpiece... I am looking forward to seeing other graphic novels by Miller get screened because they have that darkness that is somewhat unique. I loved Sin City, but some scenes involving Mickey Rourke, Benicio del Toro and the Yellor Bastard ruin the splendid scenes done by Bruce Willis or Josh Hartnett.

Interesting.,"While exiting the cinema I noticed several people saying such things as ""...best film ever"" and ""...epic..."", alternatively I also heard ""...appalling..."" etc.Firstly, I do not think this is even remotely close to being called 'the best film ever', but neither is it a -bad- film. People are complaining that it is historically inaccurate. Well, yes, there are inaccuracies but really, most forms of entertainment require a suspension of belief. Overall, I've heard it isn't -that- inaccurate anyway.Moving on, I think the film fulfils what it intends to do perfectly. I.e. be a faithful adaption from the comic 300, being memorable, but overall enjoyable. This is a typical blockbuster, not big on brains, but more on brawn.However, there are things that are new and refreshing so that it's not the same-old same-old. The new digitalised background I think is beautiful, you can create some truly stunning scenery from it. Some people say it appears detached and unrealistic, but it's supposed to be like that to keep that comic book feel. They could easily have made it more realistic.Next, the character development is minimal on all sides, which is slightly disappointing. The Spartans are glorified as a wonderful race, (although I think that ironic since they used to kill deformed children and mentally handicapped) the Persians are demonised and made to appear consistently deformed also to make killing them seem fair.I think the character of Ephialtes is designed deliberately so he can be easily hated, which I dislike.Overall, this film may have been over-hyped, but I think its a decent and faithful adaption of a comic book, and a decent enough blockbuster. It doesn't make you think, but the effects and choreography mean that you don't have to.NeonBlue.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

"Visually Impressive, but nationalistic?","I loved this movie 300, i found it visually impressive. At first i was confused to why the Persians and Spartans looked so exaggerated, i then realized that it was for artistic interpretation of characters, many need to remember that this is based off of a graphic novel so to give it an effect all the characters look comic bookish (example sin city) once I came to this conclusion i was very satisfied. I don't think the Persians were portrayed in the right light though i some what doubt that the Persians would brutalize women and children. In fact ancient Persia was the most tolerant and peaceful of all the empires at one time, a very civilized people. But what people forget is that that in this movie The Persians came to conquer Sparta and Greece, and the Spartans had always been militaristic and tough. Once again the Persians came to conquer, so naturally they defend their lands like any people even today would do despite the best intentions of the opponent. So really i feel this movie suffered only minor inaccuracies and even they were few. And another thing, the reason why the Persians may look so tall is because the Greeks were not very tall, and this film is coming from a Greek soldiers point of view, hence all the monstrous looks to some characters, to an ancient Greek I'm sure a six foot man would obviously appear to be a giant (Artisitic Interpretion).My problem with this film is that the Spartans sound just like those over patriotic television commercials we see here in America ""freedom isn't free"" was the impression i got this film and i felt very disturbed of the possible intentions of this film, maybe it was just a coincidence.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Alternates between boring and very interesting,"When a massive army of Persians threatens to attack Sparta its noble King throws himself and a small army of 300 into the fray, hoping to withstand the attacks or at least delay it long enough for the city to defend itself. Outnumbered by far he decides to seek his defense in a narrow mountain pass to make sure the difference in number of warriors can't be exploited by the attackers. This is the story of that battle and what happened just before and after.Based on a graphic novel the one thing that makes this film different from other films based around the same stories, tales, factual legends is the fact that it is made so that it looks half like a normal film, half like a series of drawn pictures. It also uses a lot of stop - motion sequences, slowing down the sequences of shots to an almost full stop and then picks up to full speed again, effectively accentuating the middle of the scene.This trickery works out -very- well. The film is a work of art to watch. The choice of coloring feels radiant yet chilly, and dangerous as the actual battle fray. Choice of music is done well too - really adding to the film.Still, there's a negative end to it all. The film stretches itself too long every now and then. Wild action sequences alternate with slow sequences and in effect I find this film to be pretty boring. Had they chosen to make it about 20 minutes shorter it might have been really good.7 out of 10 brave Spartans",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Inspiring for its Uniqueness,"I must start off by saying it was rather different from what I was expecting. I've seen many movies with the same positive and negative features.The positive features included the filming techniques, music and acting. The filming techniques were excellent, picking good camera angles and focusing was as best as could be hoped for. The positioning of the camera for certain angles during fight scenes made the action very spectacular. The music was very appropriate at each scene. The theme music was very dramatic, setting the mood within the audience. The acting was great, Gerard Butler was very inspiring, throughout the whole movie he wanted to achieve glory at every instant This tendency reflected the glory of Sparta well. I must commend the fighting scenes as well, they just made me want to applaud the Spartan's success for the warriors who after years of hardship to become so powerful and dominating.Before you think I have no idea where the information of the movie came from, which is the graphic novel, I believe some historical and realistic facts should have been included.The negative features did not wreck the film but they could have been prevented in my belief. Firstly, the story line was to narrow. It seems that the director tried to put a lot of the action into the 2 hours. Although the director set the context at the start, he needed to make the audience more compassionate for Sparta. This could have been done by showing them gaining a victory a moral victory during the First Persian War, portraying them as the protectors of good. Secondly, I believe the director was a bit too grotesque with his selection of certain mutant characters. Each time one of these characters appeared the audience laughed. I don't believe the director was attempting to achieve this and should have been more realistic in character selection. Finally, the story could have been more lengthy. I acknowledge the fact that the movie was portraying the greatest resistance in history, but the greatest movies are that of which the life surrounding the movie of the ""good guys / hometown"" becomes greater and more peaceful through hardship. This may seem harsh, but I did not say this was damming to the movie's excellence. The story line was still acceptable.Overall, I would give this film 7 out of 10 (on the basis movies like Return of the King are 9.5). It's an awe inspiring film, which captivated the audience through its wondrous filmography and stunning battle scenes. The drama the director incorporated was excellent. There was minor criticism which in my belief made the film more unique.For all those war and/or history genre fans, this is one movie you can't miss with it's heart rushing drama and inspiring battle scenes.And yes, I used the word inspiring a lot, only because the film is just that.By C Macdonald of Australia",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Completely blew me away,"I didn't know what to expect from this film. I've always loved the Athen/spartan time period, and was afraid they might ruin the history of the vent with a sub-par movie. I was wrong, fortunately.The movie stays true to history as far as the battle went. (some historical inaccuracies were there, like Spartans were gay for example, and only had sex with females to have a son. Also, women could not leave the homes. Scenes in Sparta shows women walking around town.) Despite that, the movie was excellent. Character development, music, and of course the Battles. This might be the best battle scenes I have ever seen in my life.Very entertaining movie, Just don't bring the kids.

Popcorn all the way; Perhaps a speculative production?,"Weren't the trailers amazing? This was what I was hoping for from 'Gladiator' - fun. Sorry, I meant to say FUN (and elephants in armour)! This is as close as anybody's going to get to a return to the beautiful heyday of eighties actioners.There's sex, and you get to see a (gasp!) nipple or two. What happened to movie sex? Pansied away by nay-sayers, moralistic bigots and religious zealots, 300 shows that it's still okay for a film aimed at the 18-30 male demographic to have sex, violence and sweaty men. Oh, and some more violence. And a bit just then. And another slo-mo, flying camera massacre...Towards the end, excitement starts to wane as you realise you've already seen arms, legs and heads chopped off (all very prettily of-course). Forgivable in a movie that means for you to say ""Hey, i've seen so much gore i'm numb to it now - Wow, the film-maker's must've meant for me to feel this way"", but a little more like overkill in this film. Whilst I was in this fugue, I considered something else that had been bugging me.This film wriggles. Wriggles all over the place - allow me to explain. The digital process that pretty much all of the shots have gone through has affected the movie as a whole (IMHO), in a bad way. Imagine a filter over every scene that tries to mask/blend the combination of VFX and live-action. Now imagine that that filter is digital, and can behave in any way the producers like. To try to replicate the effect of 'coarse' film stock, giving the film a grittier feel, blocks of colour in the background have a constant live (I prefer the term 'wriggling') pixel effect that draws your eye away from the foreground. Per the title of this comment, I imagine it might have something to do with the massive saleability of a digitally produced film in the new HD formats - with any luck, this will look amazing on a smaller Hi-Def screen.Technicalities aside, 300 is exactly what it looks like. A film about sweaty, washboard bellied men fighting heroically. The film-makers don't care about historical accuracy, appropriate languages, or political correctness in this film, and neither do I. The handsome men fight and die. The beautiful women have sex. The deformed outcast... well, you'll see.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
crap,"i already knew it was not worth seeing - but being a fan of ancient history i had to. and i am not at all a fanatic who wants to see everything accurate. BUT: the Persians are decadent ""asian hordes"", are faceless or even monsters. the traitor ""ephialtes"" is ugly, so even the biggest idiot can see the difference to the attractive muscular Spartans. how good that it's so easy to spot the evil! i can only say the visual message of this movie is deeply racist and fascist. and there is no other message. no plot, nothing. the action sequences are well performed but i personally could have done without the PC-game aesthetic. in the end it was boring. what a waste",1.0,Anonymous,Action
I Love this move!!!,"Not since Lord of the Rings movies, have I seen a movie this good. I have seen this movie 3 times since it was released 5 days ago, and every time I have enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Gerard Butler does one of the most believable acting jobs I have seen in a long time, he truly brought the character of King Leonidas alive. The scenery in this movie is captivating, and the soundtrack is great. I love the way Zack Snyder brought this story together and brought the pages of Frank Millers graphic novel to life. This is what movies are about, this is proof that it pays off to do something different. Thisis why I love movies!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
gotta see it,"First of all, this movie is a new level in epics. Lots of blood, lots of unforgettable quotes. Forget about the story (which is typical to me) but all the fighting scenes and filming techniques are amazing. It's a thrilling movie. I've seen it only once but i could watch it 10 times without getting bored. I'd like to give an A+ to Gerard Butler for his marvelous acting. I believe this movie will definitely get at least 2 Oscars this year maybe more and it deserves it. For a long time i haven't seen such a movie makes you excited during the show.

A work of art based on a work of art based on a work of art...,"This was a truly stunning movie and it exceeded my expectations. Every moment was a visual treat, and my jaw literally dropped several times. It really was clear to see that it's origin was graphic novel, as I could appreciate the composition and coloring of most every shot.I want to talk about art. I'ts really clear by reading some of the other reviews that some people simply don't get it. I have read reviews criticizing the ab brigade, and the ""cartoony"" feel. Um... my advice is to plug this into Google:Leonidas at Thermopylae, Jacques-Louis David (1814)I am sure that any artsy type will be pleased to agree that David did ""cartoony"" paintings. They called them ""neo classical"" paintings, though, and they were all the rage to portray Greek events about 200 years ago....Its clear to me that Frank Miller was highly influenced by David's depictions of ancient greeks in his neo-classical paintings, and the movie, in turn, translated this influence to the screen. When *I* watched it, I had a nagging feeling I was watching a neo classical painting come to life - I was aware that the color corrections and shadows were intended to invoke this feeling.Back in the 80's someone did a music video of a painting come to life - paintings have different shadows than real life and they had to paint the people in this kind of an exaggerated shadow in order to get real people to resemble painted ones. The end result was amazing - everyone ""oooh'd"" over it. So they do the same thing in this movie but it seems not many got that its supposed to invoke the feeling of a neo classical painting, its not ""bad color correction"" lol! Oh DOH! Hey, MAYBE they did that on purpose.Complaints about caricatures and simple dialogue are just silly. It's a graphic novel! How much dialogue and depth do you think they can fit in a graphic novel? Its not like you can fit a 4 page dialogue in one of those squares. Graphic novels by necessity are more art and less story.And complaints about racism? Again, I direct you to our famous dead artist, Jaques Louis David, who spent a lot of time painting white greeks. It is just how it was done back then - and even before then. Da Vinci painted a white Jesus in one of the most famous paintings of all time. Do you think they intended any insult to people of our time? As for Persians being portrayed as bad guys...were they not at that battle? Were they not trying to take over Greece? To greeks, they *were* the bad guys. That's how ""conquering"" works. If you are the ""conqueree"" the ""conquerer"" is the bad guy. To other cultures, Xerxes was a hero - but this story is not from the perspective of one of those other cultures. I don't get how this is an insult? Is it not historical fact that persia tried to take over Greece?Silly for people to get all offended over something like this. Its obvious the movie was based on a graphic novel - not real life. The novel was based on an ancient and famous battle. This is a Greek heroic story and it was undoubtedly a conscious choice on Miller's part to execute it in the same neo classical style used over a hundred years ago to portray Greek heroic events. This is actually ""fitting"" and quite brilliant from an artistic standpoint.Most of the complaints I see - lack of clothes, abs, color correction, rascism - are made by people who have clearly never seen neo classical art, don't understand the concept of ""influenced by"", and cannot appreciate or understand what Miller did and how he did it. *All* these things are marks of a certain ""style"" for portraying Greek stories which was used 200 years ago - and what you see on the screen is a faithful reproduction of a graphic novel which used a lot of that style.This movie IS a work of art. I appreciate it's origins and influence and am literally in awe of it. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because it's true, I didn't really care for the characters. I am not sure if thats wholly a flaw of the movie though...I might have been too busy picking my jaw up off the floor.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
This movie trades epic points for cool points,"This movie is stylish but it is not classic nor epic. It trades its epic qualities for more modern cooler themes...such as rock music during the fight scenes.This is more of a ""last samurai"" than a ""gladiator"".This movie is a 7 (or maybe maybe 8) out of 10 and certainly is no where near the top 150 films of all time.I found many of the lines to be overly cheesy and this detracted from the realism of the film. I would much rather believe that this battle actually happened than it was just some absurd story plucked from a comic book. Though obviously you cannot expect great dialogue if it is based on a graphic novel.Definitely good entertainment but certainly not one of the best of all time and Im sure in a years time the average mark will have dropped to the 7ish range",7.0,Anonymous,Action
If you're in for a good time...this is the movie to see!,"Went to see this and was amazed. The look is gorgeous, the action is Kick*ss, the acting good. You laugh, you cheer, you cry. A must see in the theater because the visuals are so jaw dropping. Snyder was absolutely faithful to the graphic novel. I usually don't bother to comment, but because of some of the reviews that are coming from people who haven't even seen the movie, I felt I had to. My husband is Iranian, and loved this movie. The depiction of the Persians was so over the top with the monsters that he just couldn't take offense because it had no relation to reality. He said he just enjoyed the action and the ride. There is a internet campaign in Iran against the movie, and they have been told to post reviews all over the internet, though they haven't even seen it. There was an article about it on CNN. Let's just post honest reviews with no political agenda. It's a good movie, just go and enjoy it for what it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Acting is the number one casualty in this battle!,"Magnificently filmed, form wins hands down over content in ""300"" and proves that while you can pour bucks into creating the look of a graphic novel, sticking to the same style of writing only causes a knock-on effect that results in acting that at best is cardboard-cutout, at worst (and mainly) excruciatingly campy. The very unfortunate, painful voice over only underlines it all. Personally I had to block out everything but the visuals and the real hero of the film is the Cinematographer, the Hair, Makeup and Art Department. Gerrard Butler's intense gaze holds it somewhat together, but even then one is more impressed by his massive pectorals than his mostly hidden, massive talent. Once again, Hollywood has created a nice-looking, high production-value D-movie. Perhaps if, following in the footsteps of ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""Apocalypto"", the producers and director had chosen to have everyone speak in ancient Greek, it might have been bearable, but in English, one can only cringe and bear it whenever one of the actors has to utter a line. The superbly gifted Rodrigo Santoro, as Xerxes, is especially ludicrous. Buried within his makeup, the fact that you can't recognize him becomes a plus: at least he might live to act another day.",,Anonymous,Action
A Cartoonist and Violent Remake,"When the ambitious King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) of Persia invades Greece with his huge army to extend his vast slave empire, the brave Ling Leonidas (Gerard Butler) brings his personal body guard army composed of three hundred warriors to defend the passage of Thermopylae, the only way by land to reach Greece. Using courage and the great battle skill of his men, he defends Thermopylae until a treacherous Greek citizen tells King Xerxes a secret goat passage leading to the back of Leonidas's army. Meanwhile, his wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headley) of Sparta tries to convince the council to send the Spartan army to fight against the Persians.The epic ""The 300 Spartans"" is a great tale of courage, heroism and idealism. This remake is more cartoonist and violent, with monsters and giants as if it were a video game. The Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro is unrecognizable in the role of the King Xerxes. I usually do not like remakes, but this one gives a different approach to the heroic King Leonidas and the three hundred Spartans that defended their country in 480 BC. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""300""",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Great looking and enjoyable, but nothing special.","I must admit I went into the film with very high expectations, and having seen it's average rating on this site I thought it was gonna be great. Wrong! The film no doubt looks fantastic but that was it, the dialogue was awful, mainly just shouting and snarling, and probably lifted directly from the comics. Also the director's insistence on putting most of the fighting in slow-mo just to re-emphasise the effects and show us again and again tiny beads of blood spattering, frustrated me.I appreciate that this is based on Miller's graphic novel and this could explain it's over-emphasis on its looks. However, Sin City is also a beautiful looking film, where it differs is having a better story, director, dialogue and actors.No chance is this film worthy of its current 8+ rating, it is very entertaining though and I'd go with a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Honor and Respect,"Director and Writer Zack Snyder's ""300"" is visually stunning and inspired storytelling. Snyder along with co-writers Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon tell the legendary story of the Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans held off the Persian army of up to perhaps 1 million soldiers for 3 days at a beach passage. The Spartans all died to a man. The resonance of their courageous action may have inspired the formation of the Greek Republic. The movie is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller. Snyder's ""300"" derives its look from Miller's comic book. ""300"" also has the distinction of being filmed entirely in front of a green screen. Consequently, ""300"" has an intentionally stylized look in tone and atmosphere. What are surprising is the touching pathos, and the effective performances amidst the dramatic hyperbole. Snyder's ""300"" is by no means a study in subtle; however, leads Gerard Butler and Lena Headey are amazing in the display of the unsaid.""300"" got me in an opening training scene with King Leonidas (Butler) and his young son. Leonidas tells his son the lesson is ""Respect and honor."" That is the context for ""300"". When the Persian Emissary questions Leonidas's wife's presence in their meeting, Queen Gorgo (Headey) says, ""Spartan women give birth to real men."" The Spartan code is never surrender. So when the Persian King Xerxes demands Sparta's submission the answer is obvious, and the course of action mandated. Leonidas enrolls 300 of his best warriors to battle the overwhelming Persian army. Gorgo says to Leonidas , ""Come back with your shield, or on it¬Ö"" Leonidas loves Gorgo more than life, and that too goes unsaid. ""300"" is about honor, respect, and love. The movie is visually stunning and the fight scenes are spectacular. There is an amazing panoramic shot of Leonidas (Butler) dispatching a dozen Persian soldiers with shield and spear as he runs across the screen. ""300"" is blood and gore executed with great style and skill.I was fortunate to see a screening of the movie, and listen to Visual Effects Supervisor Chris Watts. Chris talked about the look of the movie and the challenges of bringing to life the ambitious goals of the movie given his resources. All the actors in ""300"" look totally ripped. Someone asked Chris if he digitally enhanced anyone's physique. Chris said that the actors trained rigorously for 8 weeks, and that there were ""no digital abs"". The Spartans in ""300"" do look awesome. And the actors captured the Spartan warrior spirit and nobility. Gerard Bulter gives a breakthrough performance as Leonidas, King of Sparta. Butler is a powerful and commanding presence that is larger than life, as dictated by the story. He also effectively tempers this with a subtle introspection and an underlying compassion. Lena Headey is an unexpected delight. As Queen Gorgo she leverages her beauty and strength, and is as compelling and driving force as Leonidas. Headey gives an understated hero's performance. The supporting cast is excellent. David Wenham is strong as Spartan Dilios, also the story's narrator. Vincent Regan embodies a father's pride and torment as the Captain. Rodrigo Santoro fittingly provides a larger than life arrogance as Xerxes.Zack Snyder's ""300"" is inspired movie making, and just plain fun to watch. Gerard Butler and Lena Headey give star-making performances. Unfortunately, ""300"" does not lend itself easily to a sequel, given the nature of the story. However, anything is possible in Hollywood. Consequently, Zack Snyder has distinguished himself as a talented director of vision and passion. Keep an eye out for Snyder's next project.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
A movie that should serve as an important exclamation point for the MPAA,"I'm not going to write an elongated review of the movie. There are already a number of excellent and well thought out reviews that I agree with completely. What I do want to write is a brief comment on what I believe this movie should mean to the industry as a whole.I will preface this with saying that I'm a one movie a week kind of person...meaning that I'm at the theatre once a week. Movies I miss are rented at our local rental joint.The movie industry is celebrating a 2006 with increased profits over the disappointing 2005. Apparently, this is because they have been waging a war over movie downloads and winning, causing people by the hundreds to abandon their bit torrent sessions and flock back to the movie theatre.Here's my point to the MPAA: If you want more people to go out to the theatre, ensure that the product that you are presenting makes full use of what a theatre can offer. If people can be happy with the quality of a downloaded product, what does that say about the movie in the first place? 300 is the second movie I have watched this year that gets it (The other is Children of Men). This is a movie that absolutely MUST be experienced in a theatre with high quality picture and sound. I see no way in which this could possibly be enjoyed in a format of any less fidelity. The visual effects and choreography are absolutely stunning, with a soundtrack that perfectly matches up with what you are witnessing on screen. Fears of an excessively violent movie were mitigated by presentation - comparisons I've read of a ballet are absolutely spot on. I only gave the movie an 9 out of 10 because I didn't enjoy the acting as much as others, but it is perfectly suitable for a movie that is a presentation of a graphic novel.In short, if you view this movie in any format less than what the original filmmakers intended, you will miss out on what makes it such an enjoyable film.If I'm sitting at MPAA headquarters, I would be deeply thinking about how to evolve the industry to take advantage of the technology available in movie theatres today and create a truly visceral experience that is worth the price of admission.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

"""300"" Presents a Glorious, Action-Packed, Stunning Slice of Greek History","At first sight the splish-springing blood and hyper-gory violence in 300 may seem cartoon-like and excessive to some. But this is only because the film is based on a graphic novel. Thus, it is indeed appropriate for the graphic-novel turned feature film scheme.This film is one you can literally call a ""picture."" The Larry Fong's cinematography in this absolutely movie stunning. Everything from the ebullient field's to the soldier's pewter-gray shield's to the rustic golden sun rays which occasionally shine through this hardened film give the film a uniquely polished look. It' as if Frank Miller himself painted each frame.The actor's own appearance will stun you as well. All the lead actors spent rigorous months to make their bodies look as though they were chiseled by Greek sculpters. The women are of course beautiful and breathtaking as well (though I don't think the female leads spent as much time in the weight room as these actor-turned-body-builders did.) At the start of the film, the characters did not seem believable. Gerard Butler and the modern, colloquial verbiage seemed out of place for a period piece. But as the movie progressed, the acting and the speech seemed more believable. When he Butler's Leonidas proclaims to the Persian messenger ""THIS IS SPARTA!"" you can't imagine him saying it any differently, such is the power and conviction of his voice.The film is very accurate historically as well being quite realistic irrespective of the fantastic artwork and special effects. Besides a gnarled monster or two and the strange absence of food or water supplies for the soldiers in between battles, everyone and everything looks believable, and most importantly all the key plot points check out on the historian's checklist. These particular war-obsessed ancient Greeks really did ""discard"" many weak-looking male babies and all disfigured ones. It really did happen as like the citizen-type selection process in Antz (at birth, the male baby ants in that film were either given spears or hammer's, signifying them for either the soldier or the worker-ant life).I found it inspiring, and I immediately thought of the soldiers who choose to enlist (and sometimes fight) in our army. Without them (and the laws that banished the draft), many would have to join up and fight against their will. The few and the proud these mighty Spartans are, indubitably.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Seeing lord of the rings and king Kong and a few other movies where the savages are all ""native"", nonwhite people didn't bother me as much as this movie did. These savages were from a nameless land, in a fantasy world. But to actually call the savages Chinese, Indians, blacks, Persians, the deformed, the homosexual is taking it to a new level. Empathy I think the greatest single human emotion. How would white people like it if they were constantly portrayed as dumb monster to be slaughtered by the hundreds and thousands. Repeatedly in movie after movie after movie. Does this make any sense? Yes this might be a ridiculous film with no connection with reality of the human world but so where Hitler's speeches about his races superiority. Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should.

"""300 Has Bad-Ass Written All Over It""","Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, ""300"" centres on the 300 Spartans that defended their freedom with their lives against an army of thousands.What can one say about ""300"" that hasn't already been said? One simply has to watch the trailer to know exactly what they are getting themselves into when they go to see ""300"", a visually stunning film that piles the bodies high and blood splatter higher. Without a well known cast and a director that only has one film under his belt it would take something impressive to attract people. The ""300"" trailer did just this, as hype of the film spread like wildfire throughout the internet and months before it's release was being hailed as the next big thing in cinema. Well, the film has finally arrived and it's safe to say that you can add it to the list along with: ""The Matrix"", ""Star Wars"", ""LOTR"" and ""Citizen Kane"" as films that have changed the way we look at cinema.""300"" opens with a back-story to a normal starting life of a Spartan, if the baby is born too small or too weak, it's literally tossed off a cliff. Taught to fight as early as he can walk, the Spartan must learn to be tough and leave no room for weakness. Every Spartan must go through a test, in the film's case it was against a wolf. This has been done for years and you get the sense that these guys are serious.""300"" is the second film based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller. ""Sin City"" generated the same amount of hype across the globe and has its own unique visual style. If ""Sin City"" was the first step into the next generation of film, then ""300"" is a giant leap. Its beautiful colours are enough to draw an audience regardless of the films quality. Lucky for us it's not just its visual style that makes the film good. Shot entirely on green screen, Snyder is able to create a world full of muscular Spartans, ugly monsters and violent battle scenes, creatively and effectively. The tans/yellows of the battle ground provide a great backdrop for the red coated Spartans. Boy, does that red ever jump out at you too.Knowing the history of Spartans, the film is not totally accurate, but it gets the basics down. These warriors were born to be fighters and nothing else. The filmmakers intended to not be historically accurate in order to give an entertaining film, and it works like a charm. This is something ""Troy"" and ""Alexander"" suffered from greatly. Hearing the story that only 300 men defended themselves against thousands upon thousands could raise a few eyebrows. That's until you see these warriors and their lifestyles. They don't have normal professions back home. They're not blacksmiths or carpenters, as one character says, they're warriors, that's their profession. These men were meant to fight and the actors look spot on.Gerard Butler, whom I only recognize from the Tomb Raider sequel, embodies what a Spartan is. Here's a guy who made me believe he was an actual Spartan. He has just the right amount of honours and leadership to command the army and the film; he does so with ease. Hidden behind a beard and his helmet for most of the film, Butler pulls off a great performance of a man who is not afraid to be on the front lines in battle. It's an honest performance that could take some by surprise, if you think the film is only about yelling Sparta every couple of seconds, you're only half right.Snyder is quickly becoming a favourite of mine. Here is a young guy with obvious talent, who took on two difficult films that had an audience before the film was released. Creating a worthy remake with ""Dawn of the Dead"", Snyder tackled this project head on. Working on digital only enhances the creativity this guy can bring to a project. Only time will tell if he can solidify himself in the business with his next undertaking of ""The Watchmen"".Much like Miller's other work, ""300"" is a brutal film that doesn't let up with its content. The film tells you point blank that it's going to be bloody violent and it actually keeps its promise. Only once or twice does it slow down for some dialogue, to let the viewer settle down after watching an onslaught of violence. The violence is stylized, mixing fast and slow motion left right and centre. The blood is CGI and legs, heads and arms do fly off at every corner. But the violence is stylized so much, that in the end the gore factor doesn't seem like a lot. You know you're watching gory images, but it doesn't send chills down your spine, instead you simply think, ""That was cool"". The entire film plays out like a wet dream to every movie aficionado, video game player, comic book reader (sorry graphic novel reader) out there. It's a shame that Alan Moore hasn't had as good a time at the movies as Frank Miller has, graphic novel adaptations need visionary directors.I totally recommend ""300"", for anyone looking for a visionary film and who's not afraid of violence on the screen. It's a roller-coaster ride that only ends when the screen turns black. The final moments of the film gave me goose bumps and there are too many beautiful scenes to name one as my favourite. ""300"" earns its R rating; it's a hard nose slobber-knocker. The body count is in the thousands and the blood is in the gallons. For a fully enjoyable experience, one should see this on IMAX. If you really want to know what ""300"" is like, it's basically the trailer, extended past two hours.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Visually stunning, completely shallow but solid entertainment!","'300' is one of the most famous underdog stories (next to Rocky) ever told, recounting the Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans held off the entire Persian Empire.First off, let's just put things into perspective. This film is based on the graphic novel, which itself was based on the film 'The 300 Spartans' which was then based on the event. In other words, 300 is very much removed from historical accuracy and should not be approached if thats what you're expecting.Told from the perspective of Dilios, a Spartan soldier/messenger, the film is given the freedom to embellish and exaggerate as much as possible. Therefore, as the battles go on, each one is more and more OTT featuring everything from chained-mutant-giants to bomb-throwing magicians. In fact, you get the feeling that the film is constantly trying to out-do the last set-piece. As a result, the pace rarely lets up until the last 20 minutes or so where political aspects take over.On a technical level, the film is a masterpiece and a real assault on the senses. From the booming opening logos, to the epic-choral soundtrack, the film sets out to impress. And it does. Just about every shot in 300 could be framed and put up on your wall, it looks that good. The film is a series of iconic images that range from a tree covered in dead bodies to fleets of Persian ships being smashed in a storm.Finally, while most of the dialogue is pretty dodgy and there is very little depth to 300, the film is carried well by Gerard Butler as King Leonidas who's performance convinces as a man who you wouldn't wanna cross, but would follow to certain death.There are plenty of flaws to 300, but I think it comes down to what you expect from a film that was quite clearly advertised as a visual spectacle more than anything.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
An excellent movie,"A movie made perfection out of all other action movies. Story of bravest men ever walked the earth and Leonidas' role taken by Gerard was excellently played. I don't think you can ask more in a movie than 300. A pure ingenious perfection, although it hit some sensitive spots of some countries where the Persian Empire ruled over 2000 years ago. Yet you can never complain about the ungoing action and the passion of the battle's importance to King Leonidas and his great words of leadership makes you feel as if you're in the movie yourself and your led by Leonidas to make a last stand. You also cant complain about the racism of the people whom are descendants of Persian Empire, this movie was nearly word for word made from the Graphic Novel 300 by Frank Miller.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"Visually stunning, artistically lacking","A fan of the earlier film adaptation of Frank Miller's work, Sin City, I held rather optimistic expectations for the highly-touted bloodbath ""300."" As nearly anyone who's seen it will attest, 300 is a stupendously stunning visual accomplishment. The visual effects, color themes, sets and most props and costumes blended seamlessly to create an awe-inspiring spectacle of war portrayed candidly.But my accolades cease here.Beyond its gritty, ultra-violent visual appeal, 300 leaves much to be desired in nearly every other relevant category. Chiefly, its portrayal of the Battle of Thermopylae does not hold true with many historical facts of the real battle. Leonidas fights alongside a larger, albeit less skilled, horde of Arcadians in the film, when in actuality King Leonidas rallied his Spartans alongside hundreds of very capable Mantineans, Thebans, Phocians, Corinthians and Phlians, just to name a few.Secondly, the thematic element which attempted to establish identity with the viewer, that of ""patriotism"" and ""freedom at all costs,"" defeats itself and leaves a hollow void, severely detracting from the film's emotional appeal. I reason thusly: the writer goes to great pains to illustrate the disciplined, war-driven Spartan way of life: that of constant training for battle and absolutely no room for emotion; a culture utterly devoted to the study of warfare and the art of killing. According to 300, Spartans live to kill, and for no other reason (this ""fact"" is further reinforced by the scene where Leonidas and his detachment encounters the Arcadians for the first time).Yet contrast this thematic element to the aforementioned theme of raging patriotism and the rallying cry of a free people to resist tyranny and subjugation at all costs, and we're left with all the emotionally moving effect of a paralyzed dog trying to chase a dead cat. Why should I feel sympathetic to the freedom and independence of a nation that prides itself *solely* on the destruction of others? I paraphrase Leonidas' rallying cry to his troops, and the moral underpinning of 300: ""Let's fight and die for our right to fight and die!"" Theme aside, 300 suffers from almost total lack of character development or compelling developments to the plot. The audience breaks from the incessant, gratuitous, utterly unrealistic portrayal of spraying blood only to witness a thin subplot involving Leonidas' wife and a treacherous member of the Spartan senate. All else barely qualifies as mere story-building or plain filler. The audience does not leave the theater with any meaningful understanding of actual tradition or culture from ancient Greece, yet leaves quite reassured that all ancient Persians were incompetent, foolhardy and inhuman.Summarily, 300 offers quite a scrumptious treat for those expecting 117 minutes of brutal human slaughter captured in Matrix-like slow-mo camera style drenched in copious amounts of computer-generated blood. But to those who enjoy depth, historical accuracy, plot variation and emotional prowess in their films, 300 will certainly not impress you.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

Absolutely Mesmerizing,"If nothing else, this film is visually stunning. Any frame of this film could be individually captured, enlarged and hung in an art gallery. Luckily the film, for its own sake, has much more to offer. '300' is an absolute success, one of the few films I have seen recently worth every cent of the ticket price. The film offers a solid plot executed with near flawless cinematography, expert narration and the sort of action that could make Jean Claude Van Damme blush with shame.Very few films could successfully weave such a condensed amount of action into a wholly compelling storyline and still remain consistent and fresh, and even fewer films can maintain so many violent and gory images while still maintaining such an empathetic and human element. Almost any person should be able to enjoy this movie for one reason or another, be it the already acclaimed cinematography, the compelling storyline, the incredible acting, or just the visual enticement of brightly colored moving pictures flashing upon the screen. '300' is a smashing success.If you only see one movie this year, you probably don't get out of the house much. If you want to see an incredible movie, go see '300'.

Outstanding!,"300 had a lot of hype surrounding it. I felt trailers for it were out a lot earlier than most films, everyone was talking about it and it is easy to see why!This film is outstanding. It makes films like Troy, Alexander and all others in the genre look amateur. Visually stunning, 300 has some of the best looking CGI I have seen in a long time.The acting is also top notch, you can't envisage anyone else playing Butler's role as the main character, King Leonidas.The battle scenes in the film are fantastic. They are not like the ones from films such as Troy and Braveheart for instance, where it is just a mass brawl and everyone is just killing everyone else. In 300 the fight scenes are slowed down so that you get the chance to see what each person is doing!You leave the cinema feeling as if, this time, it was worth the paying the money to go see it and want to pay more to see it again!Overall Miller and Snyder have created a work of art, which I for one, will Definitely be going to see again, Bravo, 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Prepare for Glory,"300 is an epic movie along the lines of Braveheart, Gladiator, or even any of the Lord of the Rings films¬Ö except on steroids. It offers what Sin City (also written by Frank Miller) offered: blood, broads, and battle.Don't go in expecting a historically accurate depiction of the events that transpired at the Battle of Thermopylae lead by King Leonidis. This is a history movie for action buffs.Set around 480 B.C., 300 tells the tale of King Leonidis' (Gerard Butler) fight against an entire Persian army (lead by King Xerxes, played by Rodrigo Santoro). This isn't an ordinary battle¬Ö it's 300 Spartans against thousands of Persians. With his faithful Captain (Vincent Regan), the strong Dilios (David Wenham), and the sometimes arrogant Stelios (Michael Fassbender), it is evident that this is no ordinary army. The Spartans are a breed of mankind born to be warriors. They've been trained since the day they learned to walk to be ruthless and fierce soldiers.I'm sure everyone already knows that it's a big war movie of sorts, but why are they going to war? The conflict begins when a Persian messenger is sent to speak with Leonidis and the beautiful Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey). He offers them peace through means of submission to the Persian king. ""Earth and water."" This doesn't settle well with Leonidis as he handles the situation¬Ö accordingly.Leonidis wishes to put Sparta at war with the Persians, but it doesn't settle well with the Spartan council, mainly Theron (Dominic West) who has an agenda of his own. Against the wishes of the council, Leonidis ventures out with 300 of Sparta's best men to confront the Persians. While they're away, the Queen faces conflict with Theron and the council, wishing to send reinforcements to aid the 300.The film is visually arresting - kudos to Zack Snyder (fingers crossed for Watchmen). Astounding effects and gorgeous scenery (all CGI) make for some of the most breathtaking images in modern cinema. The slightly saturated look of the film is very welcome. The soundtrack was quite impressive, amazing choral selections as well as brutal percussion fit the mood of each scene (however, isn't the ""Moaning Woman"" a bit overdone?). The acting was fine for this type of movie, certainly not Academy worthy, but not detracting from the experience.But you don't see the film for the acting. You see it for the action, and it's top notch. Brutal at times, yet very flowing, almost like a dance. There was one particular sequence which I found supremely badass in which the Captain's son and Stelios do this awesome thing back to back, playing off each other and kicking butt along the way. Very very cool.The Queen's subplot adds some political intrigue, but really offers nothing needed to the overall narrative of the film. My only gripe with the film would have to be that it wasn't long enough, falling short of two hours. But that's really minute.300 brings new meaning to the word ""epic."" The grandeur of the film makes for one enjoyable ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Issue the Army with flip flops!,"So, the 300 are away, and what have they got on their feet? Bloody sandals! And they go to face an army of thousands, with a spear, a rusty shield, and those bloody flip flops!So my question to the Government? Why not issue our armed forces with an old pair of flip flops. They'd be well hard then, like Russel in Gladiator or Kirk in Spartacus. And they'd be able to fight on the beach without having to stop to empty their boots!And while we're at it at stop all those silly marches (SAS) over the Brecon Beacons with a sixty pound back pack, the 300 marched hundreds of miles, and then slaughtered thousands of the enemy, not a back pack in sight. No food, no water, no donkeys with supplies. Proper hard fighting men. The only sustenence seen was an apple, and guess who had it? The King of course!Great film,enjoyed it immensely.

This movie is really a mans movie but i think women might enjoy it as well. It definitely deserved the R Rating, but I think that it was definitely one of the best movies i have seen in a long time.

Time wast,"After seeing it's trailers, I thought that at last I found a good epic to watch. But this waiting has been ended with a disappointment. All the story is built up on a heroic & unbelievable butcher born, supernatural, AOHUUUU screaming guys. After 45 minutes later, these guys started to make me wish to see the film's end. At least I thought so... I hardly understand the reason of so much pumping to the muscles during all the film. I was wishing to hear poetic, good sentences as before in TROY, but this one can not catch it's emotion and no charisma in the characters. I never read and saw it's comics/books, but if the original source is kept as itself in the movie, this is a very very big time waste for the readers, too. After Ghost Rider, again, this one could not give me the feeling I was waiting for. I don't know, you may like it if you like to see the violence. Try & see...",6.0,Anonymous,Action
300: A tale about men with too many muscles who yell a lot and fight in slow motion,"I don't get it...Why do so many people like this incredibly stupid and boring film? Is all the ""wooting"" and praise because of the visuals? Yeah, the movie was shot against a blue screen and had a year of post-production work done to it, but what about the production design itself? To me, the actual style of the film was lackluster. Everything was a muddy brown color, and the shadows were too dark.The movie wasn't a complete waste, hence my rating. There were a couple of good visuals in the film, particularly with the 1/2 naked woman moving in slow motion through, what seemed like, water. But other than that, and a few nice punches and kicks, I saw nothing particularly special about 300. Even the fight scenes were annoying with their gratuitous use of slow motion before and after every hit.If you want to see a good visual film that also has a story, I highly recommend Sin City.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"...with chopped limbs, spilled blood, and a total disregard for realism, by God it's a story well told.","Review: 300 - Directed by Zack Snyder Rated R for graphic battle sequences throughout, some sexuality and nudity.In the world of graphic novels, few are as revered or critically acclaimed as Frank Miller and Lynn Varley's 300. Epic, beautiful, and brutal, it's 88 pages of pure machismo drenched in blood and sweat and presented in the larger than life boldness of sickly earth-tones and deep crimson. Where it counts, director Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead remake) translates this unique look to his big screen adaptation of Frank Miller's masterpiece. However, as is often the case with comic to movie attempts, some things work best only on paper.In 300, Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) leads (surprise) 300 of his finest warriors into battle against the vast Persian armies of King Xerxes. Outnumbered beyond reason, Leonidas chooses to make his stand at the 'Hot Gates', a twisted mountain path facing the sea where the vastness of the Persian army will be of no use. Meanwhile, on the home front, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) struggles with the corrupt and complacent Greek senate to send reinforcements to aid in the King's battle.What I enjoyed so greatly about Frank Miller's 300 graphic novel was the relentless pacing of the story. Fairly short by graphic novel standards, there was nary a page that went by without stunning imagery of violent combat. The focus was placed firmly on the heroism and intractability of Leonidas and his men, with brief flashbacks filling in the less important buildup to the battle. But although the battle sequences in the 300 film were an almost frame-per-frame copy of the graphic novel, the movie as a whole takes on a different feel than its source.Quite unlike the fierce compactness of the novel, more than a few parts of Snyder's 300 felt like unwarranted filler. Don't get me wrong, the primary focus is still on Spartan bravery in gloriously gory clashes, but the added story of Queen Gorgo and Theron seemed tacked on. Breaking up the pace of the action, these scenes do little but increase 300's runtime.Although much of the acting in 300 involved little else then looking beefy and being able to recite your lines whilst shouting, Gerard Butler and crew do an admirable job humanizing the godlike Spartan warriors. Likewise, Rodrigo Santoro's portrayal of King Xerxes is, at the very least, unsettling.Overly dramatic and unnecessarily deep at times, 300 is still the story of one of the most epic battles in human history. And with chopped limbs, spilled blood, and a total disregard for realism, by God it's a story well told. With ear-shatteringly powerful sound effects and dazzling visual flair, 300 is guaranteed to blow you to the back of your seat. This is one movie that you will not soon forget.Rating: 4.5 / 5",9.0,Anonymous,Action

Comic-book fantasy garbage,"I registered an account here just to tell everyone how much this movie sucks.I read some criticisms before seeing it, and they mainly consisted of comments like ""it's too violent"" or ""no character development"".I didn't really care about either of these things, I just wanted to see some awesome military battles. Unfortunately, 300 offers virtually no information on the fascinating strategics of this battle.The thing that really killed it for me was the use of bad CG and fantasy characters. Elephants were shown three times their real size, and freakish comic book fantasy characters turned up for no reason.This battle really happened. There's no reason to embellish it with Lord of the Rings crap. This movie will be forgotten very soon.",,Anonymous,Action
Holy Crap! (in a good way),"I went in with high expectations considering who was in on this (Frank Miller of Sin City and Comic Book fame). That usually results in me leaving upset at having wasted time and money on some piece of crap. Not in this case! Visually I haven't seen a movie this sweet looking since the first Matrix. The difference; where Matrix was subtle with its green colors inside the matrix and other less than obvious effects to keep us guessing, 300 is just beautiful to watch, look at, and very in your face! There is one GLARING flaw in the cinematography though. Despite the obvious amount of time, money, and effort that was spent making this production appear a certain way they at some point decided to save money on the blood effects. It is so obviously a crude c.g.i. effect that is very poorly done and acts nothing at all what I would think blood would act like. And believe me, there are buckets of blood spewn in this epic. There was also little to no character development. We pretty much get a few minutes of intro into the situation before we start into the ""We are Spartans and bow to no man"" scenario. The movie could have EASILY benefited from another half hour of screen time in which they introduced and developed some of the characters in more detail. While the movie is in the same vein as Braveheart or Gladiator you just don't care as much for the actors as you would in those movies. Other than the action side there is a chance to develop some political issues as the empire faces impending war. They are torn between whether or not to support the 300 without provocation, or even whether or not to do so at all. Yet this side is hardly delved into despite it being a very big part of the situation. The fact they spent just a bit of time on this side of the story aggravated me as this explained in more detail what was going on than the fights did. Expect some creative license to be taken in this movie. Despite the fact they claim it is based on actual events there are some unbelievable characters, actions, situations. While this is a bit of a negative when someone bases something on reality the movie never comes off as being anything more than a good story, and is even presented as such. Because of this I am not sure if this is a valid complaint but something that stuck with me none the less.Despite these MINOR issues this was one of the few times I was more than happy to spend $4 for a soda and sit amongst a bunch of strangers (not to mention my brother's driving). This movie was just plain f'ing great and I am going to buy the DVD the second it hits shelves. Spend the few bucks and go see it if you are into these types of movies. Hell...check it out even if you aren't, you won't be disappointed!",8.0,Anonymous,Action
A Graphically Stunning War Movie,"This might be lost in a sea of opinions but I'll write it anyway.I went to see this movie without knowing anything about it (""It's about a war,"" my friend summarized for me) or reading the graphic novel beforehand and came out positive I had gotten my money's worth...until I came here.As an amateur photographer and would-be graphic designer, yeah, I was pretty impressed and in complete shock and awe the entire way through. But I assume most people agree that the stylization was unlike anything ever before seen or completely hated it.As for the plot that many have told me either didn't exist or was completely lousy, I disagree with both. The plot existed, though weak at times during the battle scenes, and was compelling enough for a movie about war. In fact, I think there are some lessons to be had here: the noble king willing to die for his principles and only asks what he gives in return (complete devotion to the cause), the queen, hovering between oppression and freedom, who, despite her missteps, attempts to protect the man she loves and follow her own moral compass, and the masses though ignorant and open to deception but sometimes still capable of learning the truth. Nothing new but definitely things worth repeating. To those who think I'm reaching too far, they're not reaching far enough (or even too far those allegory-of-the-war-in-Iraq-sayers) or are being too critical to see the obvious.Those who believe this is a ripoff of LotR, Braveheart, etc., I encourage you to read the Bible or at least research its impact on the entire literary world (as I'm not a religious person and would never ask an irreligious person to read the Bible in its entirety). All of those 'original' movies and books you hold so dear to your heart take metaphors, allegories, and even their entire plots from the Bible itself. The Bible does cover nearly every topic or story you can possibly think of from your standard miracles to incest and fathers murdering their own daughters and reduces all those 'compelling' and 'interesting' plots to a few simple verses or short chapters.This is a war movie, complete with battle scenes of unnecessary goriness, that covers the same morals and principles of any other movie promoting freedom and self-sacrifice to get it. This one's just so much prettier to look at.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
'This is... Incredible!',"I recently saw '300' in my local cinema and was blown away by it. I heard a lot of different opinions of the film so i went with an open mind and i really enjoyed it. This film i believe comes close to the greatness of such high class historical movies like 'Braveheart' and 'Gladiator'. The violence, the language, the way its shot are all key aspects into why this movie is so great, not only that its 90% historically accurate which is more than what other movies like this can say. I felt the true spirit of the Spartans and the shear will to fight for their country was shown brilliantly throughout the film and made you want to shout out and cheer when they are slaughtering all those Persians. Also i thought that Gerald Butler was incredible as King Leonidas as i have to say i did doubt him playing such a ruthless leader as the last character i saw him play was the Phantom from 'Phantom of the Opera', yet he certainly carried this character of well. I think that Zack Synder did a wonderful job at directing and i hope he carries on making great movies like this and the 'Dawn of the Dead' remake.Overall if you like epic movies then this is the one for you or if you liked the way 'Sin City' was shot then i would recommend this for you, saying that i would pretty much recommend it to anyone as this could be one of the best films of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"Very Artistic, amazing!","I found this to be an extraordinary film. Extremely artistic, something to leave me feeling inspired and ""wow-ed"". I've read people complaining about the movie being awful and I disagree. There are plenty of movies with a better storyline or better actors, but I don't think that was the whole idea of 300. I believe this movie is the key to movie makers to expand their horizons and take that extra step to make a film that blows you away. The CGI was awesome, not necessarily realistic at all times, but it will leave you breathless and staring. I think it was about time that a movie has taken advantage of the technology we are plenty capable of in this generation. Do not come to see this movie expecting the usual sappy or war movie. This movie has a feel between the Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Gladiator, but don't let that fool you. It has elements from the 3 movies, but it is a movie that stands alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"If I could give it a zero, I would","This is without doubt, one of the worst films I have ever seen. Sure, I've seen dreadful TV movies with bad scripts and bad acting. I don't have to sit through them to know that anything starring Rob Schenider or made by the Wayans brothers is more than likely completely without merit, but let's put this in perspective. None of those wretched films cost as much as 300 did. They don't aspire to be as epic, and they aren't bloated with such self importance as 300.I saw 300 when it was the Surprise Film at the Dublin International Film Festival, and while it was welcomed by applause from a substantial pocket of eager fans, to say it was a successful selection would be a gross overstatement.Several people walked out, and while many people will attest to being impressed by it, or overhearing favourable comments afterwards, the only comments I heard from people shuffling incredulously out into the night were negative. If it wasn't for the fact that I was waiting for the credits to find out who played the queen - I recognised Lena Headey but just couldn't place her - I would have walked out myself.Given that I saw the film completely unconditioned by trailers or pre-publicity material, I was able to judge it completely objectively. A dreadful, convoluted opening sequence that did nothing to engage me as an unprepared viewer, tells of young Leonidas and his rites of passage. By the time Leonidas grows to be king, I was already alienated, and an embarrassingly grave voice-over did nothing except attempt to level some sort of gravitas on a script that was already floundering in its' own self-importance, and failing to connect with the viewer.300 is being hailed all across the internet as a triumph, as a masterpiece, as a giant leap for film-making. It's not. It's badly written and badly made. It's crippled with clich√©d elements that pander to the target audience of adolescent males: gratuitous female nudity, incessant violence and woefully anachronistic chugging Emo guitars on the soundtrack. Elsewhere, the relentless carnage is complemented by the now-obligatory cod choral accompaniment as epitomised by the scores for Gladiator or The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tied to these overblown and now-overused musical themes, there are moments in this film that verge dangerously close to parody.Leonidas and his army of 300 elite men go off to defend Sparta against a barrage of increasingly insurmountable odds, but since the film-makers seem more concerned with showing off how impressive their CGI goody bag is, they fail in the opening twenty or thirty minutes to give the audience anything to generate any empathy with Leonidas or his men. It's as if an entire reel is missing. As a result, you feel nothing for their plight.To suggest, as others have, that 300 is a film that must be seen by any fan of Star Wars or Lord of the Rings is simply ludicrous. Yes, respect is due for the advancements in technology that have allowed 300 to be made in the manner in which it was done, but there is no substitute for narrative, or for decent dialogue. And the much-hyped Leonidas battle cries that are already so beloved of the internet community will soon become as hackneyed and as embarrassing as their predecessors, e.g. the cringeworthy ""Freedom!"" of Braveheart.Excretia.",1.0,Anonymous,Action

This has certainly left and good taste in my mouth. Even the end was very fitting and believable which is a real treat. Casting of mostly B rated or unknowns made this an uncompromising film in respects to who lives or dies, which is what you really want unlike ""the last Samurai"" where Tom Cruise is one of the only survivors of a epic battle. In closing this is a must for the lads but maybe the ladies might want the night out, that is unless they want to give the fellows tips on how to get into shape like almost everyone on cast.

"True to the original, entertaining and visually stunning","Frank Miller made a comic book. It took an actual event -- a suicidal stand of 300 Spartan warriors under the command of king Leonidas against a vast armies of Persian god-king Xerxes -- and transformed it into exaggerated heroic legend. It added cool remarks, cool view angles, cool action sequences, and readers loved it.This movie is that comic book transformed almost frame-by-frame onto the film; the only change is the addition of a secondary storyline about the king's wife's desperate attempt to get some reinforcements for him.These events are more than 2000 years old; the people portrayed in there have nothing to do with today Arabians (after all, the ""losers"" were worshiping their KING as god, not Allah, for god's sake!), nor with ""the West"" (those ""winners"" were disposing of weaker children without mercy, after all!). So it's not US against THEM, it's not U.S. against Muslims, and anyone trying to see that parallel in the movie is a stupid warmonger.The transformation of the comic onto film was superbly done: Same colors, same visually stunning angles. It's much better than Troy, it's much better than Gladiator (in terms of the visual appeal of the fight scenes); the edit cleverly uses ""temporal jerkiness"" (wow, I wanna trademark on this expression! :-) ) , i.e. slowing and speeding one continuous shot so that you see each kill in slow motion and the ""dance"" between kills in fast-motion; the CGI of 2006/7 allowed the film makers to create absolutely unbelievable battle sequences that are jaw-dropping.The secondary storyline seemed to me to be heavily cut; I'd say prolonging some of the scenes of that storyline with a bit more solid background for them (i.e., adding more of ""before"" and ""after"" for the scenes) would be good and I think that the extended version will add formidable amount of time to this storyline, as it seemed too brief. It's similar to Gladiator (the Extended version of which I greatly recommend), where in the original cut, certain acts didn't really seem rational, but the extended cut added plenty of ""evidence"" that justified them.To sum it up, if you're looking for a historical action, you won't be disappointed. And if you are paranoid and see anti-Whatever-ism in everything, being it The Passion of the Christ or Black Hawk Down, give this movie a break - it's over 2000 years past the events depicted and we do have a brain.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Pulp-Mythology at its Finest,"A brilliant, old-fashioned sword-and-sandal epic that in unashamedly embracing its graphic novel origins, seems to evoke the spirit of Steve Reeves' spaghetti-mythology of the 1950s and '60s. Of course, the production values are far superior to anything Pietro Francisci et al were every able to conjure, and there's considerably more blood and guts flying, but in essence, and despite the blanket use of CGI and a multi-million dollar ad campaign, '300' successfully evokes a kind of Saturday matin√©e innocence that is refreshing.Everything is painted with a very broad brush that relishes in high-camp and scenery-chewing theatrics. The good guys, led by Butler's Leonidas, are all images of stoic pride and honor; the bad guys, in the form of Xerxes and Theron, are all devilishly cruel and inhuman monsters. There's no moral ambiguity. No subtlety. Just a thrilling, testosterone fueled, popcorn action movie, the likes of which we really haven't seen since Ray Harryhausen put down his modeling tools.An excellent movie that manages to rise above the accusation of style-over-substance by being built upon the foundation of a solidly structured narrative and, through Zack Snyder, a clear and singular artistic vision that is backed up with genuine talent. All the performances manage to strike a very difficult balance ¬ñ being suitably over-the-top while retaining enough humanity to never really descend in to tedious caricature. My only gripe about the entire movie is that editor William Hoy seems out of his depth at times, particularly in the battles, seemingly unable to wrangle things in to coherent scenes. But it is a minor flaw in what is a genuinely fun and exhilarating movie that, given the sheer number of instantly iconic images, is sure to become something of a minor-classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

At one or 2 points in the movie the lead character reminded me of Sylvester Stallone when he shouted Something (no, not ""Yo, Adrian!""). In fact, this would have been a good vehicle for Stallone when he was in his prime.I give this movie ""7"" stars which makes it only one star shy of a MUST SEE movie which in my opinion is 8-9-or 10.

Noteworthy aesthetics beg to compensate for everything else,"Thrillingly visceral although noticeably repetitious, this fictionalization details some of the more rock-star moments which occurred during Greece's legendary Battle of Thermopylae. With acute precision, director Zack Snyder brings comic Frank Miller's dark adaptation of this epic war to the screen with a stunning vibrancy and attention to detail that rivals any artistic endeavorers to capture the heat of primitive battle prior. In these sequences of bloody beauty, all but the most estrogen-laden souls should marvel at the technical superiority and arresting direction caught up into capturing heated moments of blood-lust, distinguishing the creatively ambitious battle movie from similar, less splashy fare.Against longer living aspirations, the insistence on elevating all fighting to such artistic excess simply overwhelms the majority of the movie's plot-forwarding and character-developing instincts, almost making dialog seem superfluous when viewed in succession. Clearly we have a movie here that wishes to balance the dramatic significance these Spartans faced on those fateful days with an accessibility and wow factor just dying to appeal to the young male demographic. The fights remain vibrantly captivating throughout, though retrospect seems to undermine any emotional substance lingering due to the inordinate amount of adolescent pandering found during these artistically excessive sword fights. Likewise, much of the screenplay absolutely pales in comparison to any on-screen fighting, often clumsily filling in silences with repetitious, empty narrative reiterations on notions of pride, warrior spirit, respect, and any other empty sentiment tacked on to give the eye candy a little more supposed relevance.Still, anyone with a pulse should at least remain mildly engaged throughout the hyper-kinetic, ultra-stylish battle scenes, at least during the first few attacks while the presentation remains fresh. The film tends to devolve further and further into some monster-based fantasy as we go along, but anyone coming into 300 expecting a serious piece of factual storytelling should have already realized they are in the wrong theater. Everyone else, have fun!",6.0,Anonymous,Action

It's here to move you, make you feel, take you along for a ride and that is exactly what it did for me.People go on and on about how it's not telling the truth, but the thing is that kids will watch and become interested. People will google ""Sparta"", and want to know the real history, so how can you blame a movie for bringing back a piece of history that people probably never knew existed? In my eyes this movie was a work of art. The storyline was great, and it was visually appealing. So I give this movie a 10 because in all honesty I'm going to go and watch it again tomorrow. It made me cry, and in the theater i shouted yes when someone (who will not be named) got stabbed. It made me a part of the movie and I absolutely loved it.So to everyone out there, go and see it!! Go and watch this epic film, and forget that it's not historically correct...If i can, I'm sure so can you. Take a break from the real world and enjoy a film. It's not national geographic.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Comic book on the big screen,"The comic book generation invades another film genre - this time, the historical epic. I had a fairly good time with '300'; I loved the super-charged fight scenes, enjoyed the painterly backdrops, and thought the royal couple (Butler and Headey) were superb. This could, and should, have been a classic.The problem here is Frank Miller. Filmmakers seem to worship every pixel of his graphic novels, which is fine, but, translating those words and images to the big screen puts them under greater scrutiny. Do they pass muster? Yes and no. The visuals are punchy and dramatic; many scenes have jaw-dropping lighting and colour. The Spartans look great.But this is as much a historical film as Lord of the Rings, the obvious inspiration for many of the freaks, monsters and downright fantastical elements on display here. Was the battle of Thermopylae not impressive enough without introducing fantasy? Of course it was. It was the greatest last stand in history. Those embellishments are silly, and rob the movie of any depth it might have had. Miller's freak show might have worked on the page, but I groaned every time a Persian ""orc"" warrior, a Quasimodo, or a nine foot tall god-king appeared on screen.And Miller's dialogue is embarrassing. These are some of the corniest exchanges of the year. The mantra seems to be: if it works in a comic, it must work on screen. Compare this script to Braveheart's, Spartacus's or, better still, Zulu's (an infinitely better film about a last stand) and '300' is instantly juvenile.Whatever Snyder would have you believe, '300' is a movie directed by a comic book, filtered through a video game. If it weren't for Butler and Headey, this would be an utterly lifeless experience. Come on, filmmakers, if you have to film a comic, adapt it, give it some depth. Don't just let an artist's imagination run rampant.Overall verdict: fun but daft.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Frank Miller Has Done It Again!,"This is truly a work of art, the acting, the direction, the story, everything is put in place just right. Gerard Butler stars as Sparta King Leonidas. Spartans were supposedly the strongest soldiers in the world (Descended from Hercules himself) .He is put in a very difficult situation when Persian messengers come and tell them that they have to surrender or be enslaved and die. King Leonidas consults the Oracle about going to war but the Oracle forbids it. Leonidas plans to go to war anyway and gathers a 300 strong army captained by, well captain lol. Leonidas, Captain and the army travel north to the hot gates. Along the way they are joined by the Arcadions, who want to help the Spartans. When they arrive at the hot gates they see the Persian army in all of its glory (Commanded by ""God King"" Xerxes) and the battle ensues. I won't go any further than that as i will probably spoil it for you. 10/10. He done it with Sin City and Frank Miller has done it again. One more thing to say... Madness! THIS IS SPARTA!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Worth the money,"I just saw this in theaters 3 hours ago. I was looking forward to it, and it paid off. It's a good movie to see in theaters. I cannot be very sure about the historical accuracy (I forgot the details of the Battle f Thermopylae) but I am pretty sure this is not bent towards accuracy, but towards entertainment. That said, it is indeed good entertainment. The battle scenes are not a random amalgamation of blood and gore, and the rest of the scenes are pretty meaningful.If I were to compare it to something like Gladiator, I would say that 300 has more of the ""cool"" factor, if you will. It is made to make you go ""wow"", whereas Gladiator is made to be more intricate.Overall, it is worth the money. If the trailer caught your eye, go for it! You will probably not be disappointed. But If you are a history keener, maybe try saving the 10$.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Amazing,"It was a fantastic adaptation which really pulled you into the plight of the Spartan army fighting against overwhelming odds.I found the acting very high quality, i feel that not having the mega stars in this film really helped on this score as each character could be taken on his or her merits without the stereotyping which normal goes with having big stars in a film.Artistic license was taken in regards as to the historical elements of certain aspects, but this is a fantasy from the comic book so on that score i feel they did a very good job putting together a thoroughly enjoyable action movie.The feel of the film was very much like watching a moving comic with the shots which were used and the subtle colours used in the film really made it stand out in an artistic way.Another excellent comic book adaptation, lets have some more like this please.",,Anonymous,Action
A must see!,"Ever since I first seen the trailer in theaters for the first time, I knew it was going to be a great movie but had no idea what was in store. I was lucky enough to score tickets to an advanced showing and was absolutely blown away. This film has to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.Everything about this movie from visuals to acting to F/X were absolutely amazing. It's hard to describe how good the movie was but it's like Braveheart, Gladiator and Lord Of The Rings all rolled into one action packed movie.I for one will be seeing this movie again in theaters several more times. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10. It's very rare a movie comes around that I give a perfect score but if any movie deserves it, it's this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Pretty darn cool!,"This movie has awesome fighting and scenery. Some of the dialog was semi-campy but still acceptable.The coloring and shading used in the film are so surreal. There is so much detail to examine in every scene that you'll need to watch the movie several times to take it all in.The fight scenes are pretty visual, with exaggerated blood spurts as people are hacked up and their limbs go flying. The slow motion technique used for the fight scenes were awesome. This movie has some of the coolest fighting sequencing I have ever scene. Sort of reminded me of the game killer instinct where you could load up a combo attack. There were several scenes were multiple Spartans fought together in very cool corriographed routines. One in particular with two Spartans was very symbiotic when you could obviously tell that they relied on each other to stay alive on the battle filed while hacking their enemy to pieces. I just wish there could have been more of these scenes in the movie.Just remember that this movie is based on a graphic novel.

You Americans make me wanna cry!,"I love IMDb. I really do but i must say that i have never felt so betrayed by the database's user comments as those of the movie 300. However, this is not quite true. I did not see this movie because you told me it was great. I saw it because my friend said it was the worst piece of craps he had ever seen and when I saw it, it turned out to be one of the greatest comedy of all time instead of that sentimental war drama it tragically is supposed to be. When I heard that the Iranian government had complains on the movie for insulting the Persians i just thought of them as fundamentalists who doesn't know about freedom of speech. Then i realize that they are not portrayed as bad humans. They are portrayed as disgusting animals! Disgusting creatures high on uranium looking like something from the bad guys in The lord of the rings. I just wanna tell you guys in the U.S that in Sweden this is considered a comedy and if that is what it is supposed to be.

awesome,"the one thing that people aren't talking about with this movie is that the way it began and was able to suck us right in. i was worried that the movie was going to start slow and i was going to be disappointed. this was not the case at all as the storyteller explains to the viewer the history of spartan men and the process of becoming boys to men. the graphics were unbelievable as everyone is writing and i thought that this movie being shot the way it was with that sin city high contrast feel to it was the only way it could have shot. its hard to imagine this movie not being dark, cloudy etc. Xerxes is great, the queen is great and Gerard was out of this world. hard to imagine he played the phantom of the opera, it seemed he was made for this role. awesome job and a lot of people have been waiting for this movie for a long time. well worth the wait!! go see it in the theatres!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Action

The warriors are bare chested and while silly in reality, it meshes beautifully with the stylized graphic novel world this movie is based on.

300,"Back in 2006 I used to play this movie, which I still have on DVD, at least once a week, maybe even more on my back then 5.1 which was on full blast. I cannot describe the spectacle I had everytime...it was very memorable. And now it works as a nostalgia boost.I see the flaws now, sure, but I love those flaws. It respects the comic to the most minute detail. Snyder practically used it as a storyboard. The slow-mo, the visual style, the music, the sound design, the acting, the action, it all fits and it's perfect for this kind of movie. If anything was more elevated, it will all crumble.And it also is a great motivator that survives the test of time.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Visually Stunning and enjoyable overall,"The film tells the story of 300 warriors from Sparta who battle thousands in order to protect their land and honour. From early on in this film the imagery and graphics are of the highest order, helping not only to enhance the battle scenes but also to add more blood, guts and all round gore to the film. Indeed, this is the main, but not the only, reason most people would see this film. The CGI is very well done and is laden on thick so the action, once the fighting starts, comes fast and frequent. The battle scenes are well choreographed and, while sometimes over the top, are often more enjoyable for it. Gerard Butler seems to relish his role and portrays the leader of the Spartans well. The other Spartans clearly enjoy their roles of being oiled up, shouting and generally letting off as much aggression and adrenalin as possible. The narration over the top of the film ensures you know what is happening (though its not hard to follow) and does add an atmosphere that sits quite well with the movie. It's not just the men that have fun, but also the leading lady - Lena Headey plays the Queen of Sparta superbly and it is a shame her character and sub plot is not developed more as she handles the role more than capably portraying an strong, yet understanding Queen. There are certain aspects of the film that do seem quite far fetched and at times laughable though. The plot lines and what's going to happen are startlingly obvious and so easy to work out that you want to shout it out, but then again having seen the trailers you're probably not coming along for a deep and meaningful film. Finally it has to be said that this film also probably contains the campest characters in recent cinema history - not least of all the leader of the enemy - Xerxes. An 8 foot tall showoff who wears more gold than you could shake a stick at and strikes the most shocking of poses! But this just all adds to the fun of the ride that is 300. Go and see it for the visual effects and the excitement the fight scenes offer as long as you leave any scruples and expectations of anything other than a popcorn eating visceral film at the till!!",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Deeply Artistic with Important Themes,"This film was filled with amazing visuals with acute attention to detail. Many wonderful themes were explored, including respect, honor, strength, courage, and wisdom. It transmits something of the indomitable spirit.

Good,"My friend and I went to see this movie and well I have to say I am quite impressed by the special effects and the style of the photography.The fight scenes were made to be impressive and they were cool, my friend liked the movie but didn't like the ending where the 300 Spartans died. A lot of people have had mixed reviews on this movie but personally I thought it was good, it was entertaining and my friend and I have a blast making fun of some of the characters in the movie.All in all, if you like bloody, gory, violent movies this is the one for you to watch (although it becomes a bit slow at times) it's still good to watch.

The only real flaw in this movie is that it follows Frank Miller's story TOO closely,"It would have been better to have made different, grander, artistic choices in several places in this very impressive movie. As it is, it's as if someone had challenged the director to animate Frank Miller's graphic novel, and the director decided to make his overwhelming skill and ability indisputable by doing just that, almost as if by sheer magic.For example, Gerard Butler, who in my opinion turns in a perfect performance as King Leonidas, in several places is indistinguishable with the comic's image, an image which, though arresting, I would have bet my next child was pure fantasy and impossible to find in the flesh. I was so wrong, I'm a little rattled. But why deny the fear that must have been his last emotion before setting out for the Hot Gates? Forget the comic book, his real courage would have been his overcoming that fear for the greater good.And Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo positively exudes passion and loyalty, and sensuality too. It's hard to believe anyone other than a King would try to be her match. But what woman truly thinks her husband's glorious death is preferable to his presence, no matter what the stakes?No, someone should have challenged Zack Snyder to base his movie on the novel, but to improve it anyway he thought fit. This movie could have been so much more, and I feel the loss. Still, as it is, it's going to be impossible for any male, at least, to forget. I knew the story before, and it's more complicated than shown here, but where the ancient narratives are sketchy, Miller and Snyder have filled in beautiful scenarios that evoke what the reality must have been. That took real love for the event and the people who lived it in real life.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
not good at all,"The only good thing in this movie is made by the effects which are very nice.But the rest is just garbage.It has no sense for real history or for reality...Xerxes is entirely wrong portrayed..he looks like Dalhsim from Street Fighter for God's sake...and the mutants they used in battle..pathetic.not to mention the giant rhino...The Persian empire was one of the greatest there was and in this movie it was shown very altered from real life history...the casting for the spartan was probably made by walking into every gym and work out place...and they had no armor..AAAAUUUUUUUU PATHETIC.There were some other things but i'll leave it at that..Overall this is a movie for ""Lord of the rings"" fans and for those that have no sense or desire to see a realistic historical movie and just buy the ticket for the slow motion scenes.",,Anonymous,Action

"Romping, empty-headed fun","Based on the Frank Miller (he of Sin City fame) graphic novel of the same name, 300 is set in ancient Greece. An army of 300 Spartans battled with a million-trillion-bajiillion Persian hoards long enough to save their modest city of Sparta from being pillaged. A cast of no-names, led by Glaswegian gladiator Gerard Butler, carry the film through the bloody battles, but it is the gory details of the film's visceral visuals that take centre stage. With lashings of baby oil, a whole vogue catalogue full of face piercings and not a single chest hair in sight, historians will bicker about both the film's blatant inaccuracies and apparent protofascist mentality. The truth is, it is neither of those things. It is a great big dumb action-adventure story, with a very annoying voice-over narrative, and lots of sweaty men in loin-cloths hitting each other (and occasionally shouting HAA-OOOHH!). None of 300 is meant to be taken seriously, as made apparent by the blatant lack of any substance to be found in the film. It is certainly true that, once the battles stop, the film stops too.

"Is It a ""Gay""movie?","I saw ""300"" at the Berlinale on Thursday night with no cast in the cinema... and... yeah, it's kind of great.First of all: Sorry about my bad English, but i want to express my impressions for you: ""300"" is really great entertainment. Not less and also not more. The Pictures are awesome, sometimes they look like art, not a ""hollywoodmovie"". The Fightings are well acted, choreographed and really well shot (The slow motions are awesome!). The cast is also great, i had so much fun to see ""300"". At three times during the Movie, the audience applauded and i think only 2 of the 500 people left the cinema.But I'm a little confused - is ""300"" a little bit a gay-movie? Not the Story (ok Xerxes... i'll eat my hat if he isn't gay-inspired) - but the posing of the cast! Often they stand there and had nothing to do, as to shows their muscles and poses for us.

historical lies,"To: Warner Bros. Picture Company.Cc:Zack Snyder (director) .http://www.petitiononline.com/wpci96c/Dear Warner Bros. Picture Company,This letter is in concern of making the movie, 300 by your company, which, according to all historical documents, is fraudulent and distorted, and its broadcast guarantees the violation of undeniable international legal rights.It is a proved scholarly fact that the Persian Empire in 480 B.C was the most magnificent and civilized empire. Established by the Cyrus the great, the writer of the first human right declaration, Persians ruled over significant portions of Greater Iran, the east modern Afghanistan and beyond into central Asia; in the north and west all of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), the upper Balkans peninsula (Thrace), and most of the Black Sea coastal regions; in the west and southwest the territories of modern Iraq, northern Saudi-Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt and as far west as portions of Libya. Having twenty nations under control, encompassing approximately 7.5 million square kilometers, unquestionably the Achaemenid Empire was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.Based on the Zoroastrian doctrine, it was the strong emphasis on honesty and integrity that gave the ancient Persians credibility to rule the world, even in the eyes of the people belonging to the conquered nations (Herodotus, mid 5th century B.C). Truth for the sake of truth, was the universal motto and the very core of the Persian culture that was followed not only by the great kings, but even the ordinary Persians made it a point to adhere to this code of conduct.We did not expect Warner Bros. Picture company, as one of the world's largest producers of film and television entertainment to ignore the proved obvious historical facts, and damage its own reputation by showing the Persian army at the battle of Thermopylae as some monstrous savages, and thus create an atmosphere of public mistrust in its content, and hurt the national pride of the millions of Persians while doing so.While announcing our disgust at such a heresy, we demand an immediate historical review and quick apology from the responsible people.Sincerely,",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Just for a little bit....I was a Spartan.,"Yes there are historical inaccuracies in this movie. Like any good war story some facts must be embellished, some of the events skewed all in an effort to draw the listener in and FEEL what happened in that battle.

Wait for another special to be done by the History Channel....or, go and enjoy this sensory feast of art. . Think comic book come to life and you've got this movie spot on. Even if you aren't a fan of comics it is well worth the price of admission for the speeches King Leonidas gives his men.

Though, there are bits that are not historically accurate, no skin off my nose. But those scenes add to the film, making it stronger. To me, what i felt like when i was watching this film, i was living a Conan book. Conan being pure fiction not withstanding. Its a very violent film, but what did you expect concerning this subject?

A Fresh Perspective,"One of the greatest challenges facing filmmakers in our time is how to offer a fresh perspective with every subsequent film. How does one go about doing something that appears different, and novel? This is exactly what Zack Snyder achieves with 300. He manages to re-tell an old story, with done-to-death plot elements, and special effects that are on par with other 'war' movies, to stand out from the crowd like a pretty girl. 300, simply put, is a sight for sore eyes.Gerard Butler does a terrific job as king and leader, and there isn't a single moment in the film in which you feel otherwise (maybe except when his abs are in more focus!). And, his 300 men do not disappoint in giving the impression that they really were the 300 Spartans, and it would be really unwise to make them angry.The villains in this case (the Persians) are not only vast in number (which is nothing new), but they are over the top as well. So you have a mix of Alexander and Lord of the Rings, but with a greater reality.The cinematography and editing deserves special mention too, and the movie shows how different elements of film-making, when put together in new and creative ways, almost always manages to do the trick - create a breath of fresh air.And how!",,Anonymous,Action
Great trailers do not a great movie make.....,"WARNING: CONTAINS ONE SPOILER BELOW!! Although forty is the same age as King Leonidas in this film, it also puts me outside what they call ""the target demographic"", and I guess my age has a lot to do with my lower-than-average rating.I have seen too many great films to be overly impressed by films like this (and Troy) which have a stupendous amount of available back story and sizeable budgets yet still manage to fluff their lines. Yes, the film is stunning. Yes, it is faithful to the graphic novel (if not historical fact) while still applying enough of it's own ideas (including one truly memorable scene that was almost worth the overpriced IMAX admission on it's own) Yes, the male leads mostly hold their own (especially Leonidas's captain, who, funnily enough, I think played a similar character; to equally good effect, in Troy)And the script is generally okay (at it's best when lifting direct from the graphic novel - at it's worst resembles something written by a violent youth offender who has yet to lose his virginity) But the flaws had too much of an impact on this viewer's pleasure to be ignored. Though the Iranian government has probably been overly sensitive in their condemnation of the film (perhaps only the Iranian hippies and punks should be truly angered)the Persians (and every other baddie in the film) are depicted as irredeemable b*******; alternating only between the immoral states of cowardice, vindictiveness, hubris and hedonism. Why, the filmmakers even tag some of the baddies with freaky faces, lest we start to feel any sympathy towards them. Oh yes and there is a rape scene as well. It happens to the principal actress and would I suppose have been mildly emotionally involving - if only she could act. Mind you, she's better than the lone Spartan baddie, who appears to think he's in a completely different film. I can't abide films that won't trust me to make up my own mind about the bad guys. Even Troy was not so simplistic on this level. Also, would it have been too much trouble to ask actors, playing people that all COME FROM THE SAME REGION to try to keep their accents consistent? Perhaps if they had spent as much time acting as working out, this flaw wouldn't have been so prominent. Then again they could have just CGI'd the accents as they so obviously did (another flaw) with some of the actor's six-packs. But these are the minor points. Far more injurious to my enjoyment were the three ludicrous scenes which produced howling unintentional laughs from myself and other members of the packed audience. I won't describe them all, or in detail here. But a spoiler is necessary for even the outline of one scene.S-P-O-I-L-E-R Suffice to say that when you are taken out of a film by the realization that the protagonist and antagonist are positioned, with the taller of the two behind and with his hands on the shoulder of the other during an exchange of unintentionally camp dialogue; it is hard to take things seriously from that point on. The people who were at the test screening of this film should never, ever be invited to see films for free again! And as for the antagonist,; what is the point of endowing Xeres with certain impressive CGI enhancements if not allowing him to use those attributes on the battlefield? He would certainly have made a more formidable and engrossing foe than the characterless drones who offered themselves up for slaughter. This is where the producers and directors highlight their most obvious flaw: a lack of imagination and risk to take this film beyond the good-very good, and into the realm of great. At time of writing it has already dropped out of the top 250. Give it a couple more years, as the novelty of the visuals and SAS recruitment style bravado wear off in say, a way that the storyline of the original Matrix won't, and it won't even be in the top 1000.Before I forget: Extra kudos to the CGI team for editing out the shouty Leonidas's spittle AND to the crew operating the targeted wind machine that charmed all those shy female nipples out of hiding:-)",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Stop throwing those bloody spears,"Well, well, this seems to have got the hackles up. Let's face it, it's not Citizen Caine, but nor is it Howard the Duck. It's a pretty decent slab of visually stunning untaxing entertainment which spreads the pathos a little too thickly. It seems most people leaving their opinion here would have preferred an Ibsenesque piece involving two characters emoting round a kitchen table while grappling with some contrived character arc and displaying 21st-century sensibilities.Spartans were not people who believed in multi-culturalism, neither did they adopt sophisticated and nuanced philosophies, I doubt they had much time for self-reflection and in the small time frame of history dealt with in the movie, those that went into battle had little opportunity to evolve their persona. They simply went from being alive to being dead (preferably on their shields). Of course, militaristic, brutal and slave-owning Spartans banging on endlessly about freedom grates somewhat, but they were determined their city state would remain free from outside interference at least.Athenians were a more thoughtful breed but then they probably wouldn't have lasted three days at Thermopylae. The original source material from Herodotus - and indeed the comic book by Frank Miller - is pretty threadbare in terms of story and the characters involved, so to crowbar personality nuances, plot devices and complex relationships into this simple and eternal story would be ludicrous and tiresome. Herodotus was also a Greek propagandist so to expect a fair depiction of Persians from Hollywood is perhaps naive. To claim the film has some kind of neo con agenda in this era of clashing civilisations is disingenuous and frankly gives the film an importance it doesn't deserve.300 of course deals with unfashionable ideals - heroism, duty, sacrifice - and in a selfish and cynical age these often jar, and while historical epics are often portentous (Kingdom of Heaven), a rambling mess (Alexander) or just dull (Troy), this movie at least never takes itself too seriously - unlike many who have watched. It's a bloody, brutal pantomime and at a mere couple of hours (short for this genre) fairly rattled along.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Perfection,"This movie was absolutely amazing. The battle scenes are the best I've ever seen. it is faced paced and every scene is like a piece of art work.The casting was perfect! Gerry Butler was a true leader for the Spartan army and played the role beautifully. David Whenham was wonderful as the story teller, and Lena Heady was beautiful and graceful in every scene she was in. And all the supporting cast really made the intensity of the story all the more wonderful.Each frame of this movie was truly awesome; I don't have any other way to put it. THIS MOVIE IS Definitely WORTH THE BIG SCREEN!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Wow..what a ride!,"I am not as familiar with this Frank Miller graphic novel as I was Sin City..but I think I enjoyed this movie a great deal more. Stunningly beautiful to look at, with silvers and sepias as the hyper-highlighted tones. Well acted, brilliantly directed..NOT FOR CHILDREN. Period. Violence abounds in this one and there are scenes of nudity and simulated sex. I was appalled to see several parents there with kids from 2-10 in the theatre. I don't envy them the sleepless nights comforting their nightmare plagued kids.Honestly this movie left me feeling like I had sat through a really remarkable stage play. The way it shot in front of green screens gave it a unique feel.Go see it! you shouldn't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Paths of glory,"Today, a war film has to be an anti-war film, in order to avoid any criticisms. ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is the perfect example of this kind of anti-war movie (a genre magisterially inaugurated in 1957 by Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"") : the atrocity and absurdity of the war is denounced everywhere, the battles are very realistic and barely bearable, the historical context is so exact that you have the feeling to watch a documentary, and the movie is a humanist one, where it doesn't matter who you fight with, you always fight men. ""300"" is not an anti-war movie, it's a war movie, and it's the absolute opposite of Eastwood last movie. The war is glorified for its beauty and its goals : it's needed because it's the only way to protect freedom and liberty from mysticism and tyranny. The battle sequences are grandiose and aesthetically filmed with beautiful slow motions. The historical context is just a pretext to tell a story that belongs to an ancient age, and doesn't have any reality or realism. The movie is so Manichean, that the enemy, the ""Persans"", are not human at all, they're beasts from the darkness, monsters from hell, demoniac figures that stand for evil, whereas the Spartans are perfect and fearless blond heroes, from the mythological world. Some might call it fascist, some might find this approach stupid and childish: and in a way, they're partly right, but on the other hand, I never saw a so epic, fun and grandiose movie since... since, heu, since I can't even remember when.480 BC, Leonidas refuses to make a gift to Xerces, the god emperor of Persia, the leader of the most impressive and powerful army of the world. In the name of liberty, reason and freedom, he kills all the Persian's men send by Xerxes in Spartes, and goes for war against the powerful Persian army with a fearless spartan army of 300 men, in order to convince the all Greece to fallow his example (Athens, this nation of ""philosophs and young boy's lovers"" have already stand up against Xerxes...). And then they fight, kill, and died in the fury of the battle, shouting definitive sentences like ""Spartans, tonight we dine in hell"" and laughing in front of the face of death. And, well, that's about it for the story. But does anyone need a real story if in the gigantic and impressive battle scenes are introduced well enough ? Simple stories make great tales, and that's what's the movie's all about : this is just a myth. Of course, it's simple, violent and Manichean, but, for we're in a mythical world, it's nor racist nor a propaganda movie. The all movie is nothing less than than a speech from Dilos to the Grecs, and is nothing objective and realistic. That's clear in the movie : Dilos tells us the great tale of Leonidas and the 300 Spartans, in his own, subjective and partial point of view : he doesn't tell History, he tells a story. And in his vision, the Persans are all bad and monsters. This is not the reality of the Termopyle battle : this is the Spartan's point of view on it and they exaggerated to transform it in a legend : all we have here is the legend. And this movie has absolutely nothing to see with our contemporary world or with our reality. It's just a dream, a bloody, violent, graphic, dream for little boys, who dream to be a Spartan soldier and to fight the evil Persian army. There's no message here, no morality to find, no American propaganda, and certainly no political point of view : this is just a children's dream.In fact, all this elements already (including this vision of the Persian empire) were in the wonderful 1998 comic-book by Frank Miller, except for the sub plot with Leonidas' wife (but the all morality of this sequences fits very well the Miller's universe, with its strong women an its rotten politicians). Like ""Sin City"", the movie totally looks like the comics, from its tone to its colors and photography. The method is also the same : the genre of the peplum, like the ""film noir"" for ""Sin City"", is push to its paroxysm. But it adds to ""Sin City"", which was a little too static, movement, action, and a great sens of epic. The first battle scene is absolutely amazing : it's a sort of peplumesk remake of the ""Old Boy"" scene, where you see the hero fighting endlessly against ten opponents in a video game traveling. Only that in ""300"", you see Leonidas fighting against hundreds, and you also watch the others Spartans fighting in the same sequence. I think I never saw something that impressive in a movie.Zack Snyder really becomes one of the most promising American director with this movie. And if his style isn't perfect yet (some of the scenes still reminds me of an perfume advertising, like the oracle one), ""300"" is a great movie, important both for the war movie and the epic genre, as well as for the history of comic books adaptations (the use of the slow motions, which recreates the drawings of the comics in motion, and fits the rhythm of a comic-book reading is unseen and totally original). The only thing to determine is how much does the genius of this movie really belongs to Snyder, for if ""300"" is great, Frank Miller is also responsible of it. And Snyder's first movie, ""Dawn of the dead"", was a Romero's remake. So, I impatiently wait for Znyder's own projects to see if he's really a talented artist. And if I'm pretty sure his future adaptation of ""Watchmen"" will be good (even if I'm convinced than only someone like Kubrick could have done it the masterpiece it's meant to be), it won't answer this question.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
In defense of the negative press,"I will start by addressing the negative reviews on this film. I'm sure you've heard by now, how upset Iranians are over the portrayal of Persians in the film. I won't be able to convince them otherwise, their minds have been made up, but if what they say about it turns you off of the movie, or you are of Iranian background, etc....PLEASE read this then make up your mind; First off, the MOVIE is based on a GRAPHIC NOVEL/COMIC BOOK. It is not based on actual historical fact. I don't know much about the actual battle, but I know that this movie doesn't adhere to much fact, I mean if you've seen the commercials, I doubt the Persians actually had giant zombie-like mutant soldiers to unleash. That alone should show you that the film is not done as real life. Like all comic books or war movies, there are at least two enemies. Generally speaking, one is focused as the good guys, the other as the villains. 95% of the time this is done because the film is shown from the point of view of one side. If there was an opposite version of 300 showing the Persians side, I'm sure the Persians wouldn't have an ounce of complaint of them vilifying the Spartans. How many times has this happened before? Saving Private Ryan? practically every war movie showing the side of the Allies, shows the Germans as bad guys. Now that's just the point of view from the allied soldiers. But the German army was just fighting for their country, the only true villains were Hitler, The SS, and the Nazis. Braveheart showed the English as cruel tyrants, every single man, woman, and child. But that doesn't mean they actually were. So keep all these things in mind when watching 300. Remember, it isn't a FACTUAL movie. (Also take into account how many comic books in the 40's showed superheroes kicking hell out of the 'evil' German soldiers.)Now onto the good stuff; There are outstanding movies in every genre, and this is probably the greatest film in it's genre of epic war films. It stands alone due to its unique qualities, the comic book edge allows for things that haven't been done in battle movies of the same sort, the sound of the film is probably the best ever made for a movie. Every sound has an effect, it penetrates through you, whether it be the Spartan's war cry, Leonidas' giving one of his many welcome speeches, to something as simple as sticking a spear in the ground. You feel it. I have seen this movie twice already, and most likely a third by the time you are reading this. Let me say that I NEVER go see a movie more than once in the theater, no matter how much I am looking forward to it. the only other films I've gone to see more than once was Star wars Episode I, which I saw 4 times...when I was 12. Which is tied with Star Wars: A New Hope when it was re-released, I think I was about 10 for that one.This has already become my favorite war movie. I am sure many will agree with me, and few won't. But if you haven't seen it yet, I can't tell you not to build it up in your mind so you'd be disappointed, simply because you can't be disappointed! If you think it looks good from the commercial, it is 300x better (no pun intended).",,Anonymous,Action
"Spectacularly, audaciously, outrageously silly!","Apart from acres of beautifully toned male flesh, comic-book blood and guts and a graphic novel sheen I didn't really know what to expect from 300.The dialogue is at best cheesy and at worst cringe-inducing. The characterisation is adolescent. The sex scene is incredibly unsexy. Realism is never given a look-in. As history it is hysterical. But, still, I enjoyed it.The production design is wonderful, the colours and effects (mostly) are impressive. The costumes are fabulous, those 'Spartan' torsos are glorious, a joy to behold. The fantastical, monstrous, madness of the 'Persians' beggars belief.Sprinkled with laugh-out-loud moments where you just can't believe the film-makers thought they could get away with yet another ludicrous spectacle. 300 is a lot of fun.Absolute tosh of course, you'll wince at most of the dialogue, you'll laugh at the audacity of it all, you'll drool over the 'Spartan' hunks in trunks, you'll love (or hate) the look of it but give it a go, just make sure you leave your serious head at home!",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Fighting with panache and not much else.,"I usually try and give immediate feedback where possible and as I have just finished watching the film, I think it's safe to say that I got exactly what I expected. In the same way that the film skirts any reasonable attempts at attention to detail, both in fact and picture, I will therefore not spend any time dressing up the experience for you.This does have Sin City and Gladiator all over it, but fails to live up to either, if I'm honest. It doesn't portray it's characters well enough for you to care about them. You don't care so much as what happens to them, but those with a taste for violence will be entertained by how it happens to them.This is a pretty film, dogged only by it's determination to entertain rather than inform. It could do both, but chooses not to. Nonetheless, entertaining it most certainly is. I sat through the whole thing and didn't yawn once. The fighting does get a bit repetitive after a while. After you've seen one nasty Persian knocked off a horse or get gutted by a spear, you've pretty much had the ride. Still, the ride is good enough, at least, to make you hop on a couple more times.As I said, this is really all about fighting, and doing it with style. I was reminded of Troy on occasion, but the biggest nod goes to Gladiator, helplessly hoping to emulate something that, in my opinion, can't be faulted. The use of grayscale and reds is something that all Miller designed movies will no doubt be judged on in the future, but personally, after this and Sin City, I have seen enough of these already.A no-brainer, truly, with delusions of grandeur, much like the Spartans themselves. Could do better.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Glorious and wonderful masterpiece,"As an avid Lord of the Rings, Pulp Fiction and Departed fan (I know, a bit of a geek) I must say that seeing 300 in theaters gave me the best feeling I have ever experienced in my history at the cinema. The concept of an 'army' of 300 men plus allies being able to do what it is that they did is unbelievable...until you see it for yourself.With no 'big names' this movie, in it's entirety, centers around itself and its characters and its own story lines and visual effects, opposed to many films nowadays that seem to revolve around the actors they lasso into playing the roles.Every moment depicted is breathtakingly perfect, the cinematography unbelievably fascinating as well as the battle scenes that embody the Frank Miller-esquire manner of fighting, making the deaths almost comical and quite drawn out.There is nothing about this film that I would change, given the opportunity, and for this I award 300 with a 10/10, because I just can't rate it any higher.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
A Great Popcorn Movie,"Many people have put up an argument that this is one of the best films to come out of 2007 so far. Now here's where I have to raise a hand and disagree. This was a good film, yes, with inspiring visuals and breathtaking action sequences. However, when it all boils down, this film wasn't really about changing the way you see a movie. It didn't really, how do you say, affect me as I came out of the theatre. My friend, however, couldn't shut up about it, and sighted it as one of the ""greatest films he had ever seen"". Now, not to be rude, but that's a horrible overstatement.My rating, Eight out of Ten, is not rating it based on its quality as an Oscar-worthy film: rather, on its quality compared to most Hollywood films. This is not the greatest film of all time, nor will it ever *be* the greatest film of all time. It is merely a great excuse to go to the theatre, and I promise you, it is worth your money. But, just keep one thing in mind: do not walk into that theatre expecting an emotionally deep film that will run through your head, changing your point of view on mature matters. Rather, expect a great, entertaining time at the movies: one that will stick with you as a fun action film.Eight out of Ten stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Lots of racist crap,"Some beautiful graphical work. The performances by the main actors were pretty good (though the accents were inconsistent and often unconvincingly modern-sounding). That's the best I can say about it.The story is stupid and simplistic. ""Enemy comes along. A few good men take on the evil dudes in their large numbers. Let's admire the good men forever for their bravery and courage. Let's rally to their support...yada yada yada""Characters are predictable and obvious - either plain good or bad. At least with Sin City, it felt like some interesting ideas and new ground was being covered.Anyone who is an enemy is perverted and licentious in some way, particularly the opposing race (yeah, b/c we're all that simple). It portrays war and genocide as cool. It dresses most of the baddies up in non-western costumes.The annoying thing is that the majority of the audience I was sitting with were impressionable, young boys. Yep, exactly the kind of minds that we want exposed to this stupid, racist crap. (And, not surprisingly, the highest ratings for this movie come from kids under 18.)Many people claim 300 is only a movie. If it's only a movie, I would love to see another similar movie made, but with the characterisation reversed for the races. Let's have a huge number of caucasians portrayed as pathetic, bad, immoral, disloyal, licentious, weak and stupid. Let's have a small number of Persians/Asians/Arabs portrayed as strong, heroic, courageous, loyal, self-sacrificing, intelligent and honourable. And let's have this small clan easily massacre the pathetic white people, piling their bodies in a way that's reminiscent of the holocaust.Then see the reaction of the same large group of (mostly caucasian) movie-goers who claim 300 is fantastic, and just a movie, and shouldn't be taken so seriously. Whether they admit it or not, many caucasians would despise and be upset by seeing the way the characters that ""represent"" them are portrayed and they would feel the simplistic, hateful racism that is inherent in such portrayals.This is not a movie for those who respect different cultures or value intelligent ideas.",1.0,Anonymous,Action
Unique.  Awesome.,"300 lives up to its hype, a must-see for movie lovers -- and see it in a theater, don't wait for DVD. I went with friends, and we all agreed to go again. Once is not enough. To all involved, especially Zach Snyder and Gerard Butler, you have given your audience one wild experience. Having read mixed professional critical reviews, we were prepared for disappointment, though audience reviews were mostly good to raves. We side with the ravers. If you can do so, see it at an IMAX theater. It is a groundbreaking, starmaking film, a visceral immersion in a living painting of an ancient time. As to historical accuracy, this is art and myth, a tale within a tale as told by a storyteller to rally his people to what he deeply believes to be a noble cause. In that vein, 300, to paraphrase Picasso, lies to tell the truth.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

One hell of a movie,"Gods and God, Heroes, Legends, Fables, Mentors - even Movie Stars. Figures we look up to, that inspire us. External, made in our own image, or just something that we latch onto. We escape from ourselves for a moment, become more like them. With comic-book heroes we explore broad brush-stroke ideas of heroism, romance. Cinema has been used throughout its history to raise morale or for more overt politics. Comic-book adaptations span many genres from Batman stories to examinations of existentialism (Ghost World) or reinventing neo-noir (Sin City). Based on a comic based on a film based on ancient history, 300 explodes onto screens with stark adult images of bare-chested warriors and overtly sexual Oracles. It sweeps us into a world of fantasy, but with intense bloody violence like Tarantino movies, and ""Freedom"" battle-cries reminiscent of Braveheart. It tells of 300 heroic, highly trained warriors that pitch themselves against an army numbering one million. If they die, they don't die in vain. They will inspire. They will stand for liberty. They will be the catalyst for ultimate victory and the establishment of a far-reaching moral order.King Leonidas of Ancient Sparta receives an emissary from the Persian Empire. Earth and Water, if you please, the Spartans are told, else we'll kick you to a kingdom near you where you don't wanna go. Leonidas responds to this bit of diplomacy by unceremoniously kicking emissary and entourage down a big pit.Before Leonidas can whop these aliens from Asia for being so damn cheeky, he has to ask the Oracle, a beautiful, writhing, naked young blossom being letched over by particularly ugly, deformed mystics (called Ephors - think Orcs with sex drives). Xerxes, the Persian ruler, knows well the oracles will tell Leonidas to back off as there's a religious festival due, which they do. Guessing the cunning plan, but unable to go directly against holy Ephors, Leonidas ""goes for a walk"" - together with his personal bodyguard of 300 crack soldiers.Leonidas' wife, Queen Gorgo, stays behind. Although women can open their mouths at formal events, she's still regarded as pretty second class by the all male politicians. Gorgo shows she's a Sparta woman through and through. Brave, intelligent, willing to sacrifice herself as forcefully as any male warrior, she gives a speech that would out-Maggie Thatcher. And unlike most women leaders, she's sexy and feminine.Leonidas' men, helped by woosey Athenians, acquit themselves in a manner that to put CGIs to shame (if they weren't so awesome). Like Mel Gibson in Braveheart, he has learnt to shout words like 'freedom' and 'democracy' until his men go into a hypnotic rage of murderous joy. And he has his wife to thank for it. What's a king to do, faced with the choice between religious law and a threat to his country? She tells him to ask, ""What should a free man do?"" Gorgo made no mistake in taking his mind off the 18-year old slut down the temple.""A new age has come, an age of freedom!"" echoes through the film. ""We rescue a world from mysticism and tyranny."" But although historians are already arguing over the historical accuracy or lack of it, it seems palpable that much was invented or changed to make the story, visuals, and moral imperatives 'more cool' than they ever were in ancient times. The shred of historicity seems a mere device to assist suspension of disbelief. Landscapes have the menacing simplicity of Sin City. Unlike Sin City, they are more seamlessly lifelike, yet still retain an air of fantasy. It's almost like Lord of the Rings for grown-ups.Acting is gritty throughout. Special effects could send you into Exorcist mode if you've just had lunch. Cinematography is consistently atmospheric. It feels like a two-hour descent into Mordor that makes Gladiator look gay. But if this movie can effectively get your rocks off, no review is entirely complete without acknowledging the political upheavals even as it is released.""Hollywood declares war on Iranians,"" read a headline in Iran's independent Ayende-No newspaper. A Persian journalist (born of Iranian parents in Greece) wrote, ""There has been no agenda on the part of the original novelist, movie director, cast and crew to promote an anti-Iranian agenda. The movie however (no matter how sincerely it was intended as entertainment), is nevertheless purveying messages; messages most certainly unintended by Miller or the film producers."" Which is probably a bit closer to the truth. But is that wrong?Decent Americans, at the time of the movie's release, are going through a period of schism and intense self-doubt over their increasing losses in Iraq. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the war, the families and friends of those who have lost men and women there need sources of succour and belief in themselves. The film provides heroic stereotypes who die for their beliefs and find ways of justifying or coming to terms with the accompanying grief. In 300, reverence for race, religion and sexual preferences are given short shrift. If the movie claimed to represent history and the peoples in it accurately, it would be offensive to common sense. But it does not. It is, feels like, and looks like, a comic-strip simplification and glorification of a battle. It will make much of its target audience feel good about itself. As propaganda, it is no worse, or rather far less harmful, than the propaganda churned out on a smaller scale by many Islamic countries for internal consumption. I did not find the depiction of Persians at all belittling. They look as glorious in their majesty and technical achievements as the Spartans look ferocious. The main audiences understand it is light entertainment, however baffling it may be to eastern minds (just as Manga can be baffling or even offensive to Western minds).300 is, at a pinch, not a beacon of political correctness, but it is one hell of a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
A Nutshell Review: 300,"The trailers which have whetted the appetites of fanboys everywhere have now given way to the premiere of the movie. Fanboys, the wait is over! 300 hits our shores this week, and to action buffs, this is the moment that we're waiting for! Pure, unadulterated, violent action, true to the visuals of Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name, based on an imaginative retelling of the ancient Battle of Thermopylae, where King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and 300 of his Spartan warriors defended their land against the invading Persian army, led by the self proclaimed god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro).One of the appealing factors of this classic tale is that size does not matter, so long as you've got the right techniques. It's a classic David versus Goliath, only that David is better trained, and has more grit, honour, courage to stand up for what he believes in, and to defend all that he loves. It's akin to telling the bullies not to go too far, or face the wrath and fury of those pushed to a corner. The Spartans embody the positive traits of men who are proud warriors, led by someone whom you'll always prefer to go to war with, a leader who leads, rather than a leader like Xerxes who directs.In recent times, ever since Peter Jackson unleashed his epic battles from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, we've a number of movies that hopped on the bandwagon, from Troy to Alexander, all wanting to revisit the clashing of the swords amongst gladiators. But instead of something that rings familiar (just how many fights can you sit through before they look all the same?), director Zack Snyder managed to craft very distinct looking fights, and the action choreography is something to behold, exclaiming the point that when the Spartans fight as one keen unit, they are a force to be reckoned with. You can't wait for the Spartans to use their shield-spear-sword combo, and you're rewarded soon enough. Kudos of course to the stunt team and fight choreographers in designing different battle set pieces for each incoming wave of the Persian army, and I like the bit with the oriental looking Invincibles.It's not all pure action, dismembered body parts and CGI splattering of blood. The action does take a breather once in a while to content with the usual rotting of Greek politics with Lena Headey's Queen Gorgo trying to drum up support for more Spartan warriors to join her husband in the defence of the land. As usual, the expected back stabbing, dirty politicking strokes rear its ugly head, and there are scenes that probably will get you seething. Somehow, the wise councillors always get portrayed as old buffoons, and this one is no different, especially in a scene where they act like dumb sheep.However, given that this is a well known tale, the inevitable is just waiting to happen, and somehow, I felt that it tapered off towards the end, in a rather anti-climatic manner, after raising your adrenaline each time with successive battles that seem to top the previous. I thought at certain points you could draw upon references from other contemporary movies. Certain plot points and shots somehow reminded me of Zhang Yimou's Hero, with its rousing army war cries and the liberal use of arrows. Not only that, Lord of the Rings was tapped upon again, in giving us a Gollum-looking like ""creature"" used in a similar mould. And Braveheart too comes to mind.But those aside, I would say this has all the ingredients for box office success. Sex and violence sells, and I'm pleased that this movie survived the censors unscathed, with an M18 rating. If the Oracle brings to mind the jolly matronly like lady in the Matrix movies, this movie will attempt to shake off that memory with a writhing nymph like seer.I do not know how anyone can boo at this movie, unless of course you're not an action movie lover. Sit back, relax and watch the spectacle unfold up close as if you're battling side by side with the Spartans. It doesn't get any better than that.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

The only way. The way of Virtue, just like the one Hercules chose to walk.In Greece we have a word for it... ""dobrosini"". Can't be translated exactly in English but ""directness"" is the meaning...

"A stylistic triumph, but somewhat lacking","I was interested in seeing 300. After seeing it, did I like it? Sort of. Starting with the good things, it is visually, technically and stylistically amazing with wonderful costumes and sets. The battle sequences are superbly shot and quite realistic, and the music and acting(the protagonist played by Gerard Butler is very charismatic) are decent, as is the direction. Plus there are some compelling parts in the story, and the script has its moments. However, 300 is not very well paced, in fact for me it was quite slow and pedestrian in places, while there are one two many clich√©s and stereotypes, one or two them I agree bordered on offensive.

Beautilful combination of art and emotion.,"For those of you who are bashing 300 for its unrealistic action and brute violence have completely missed the underlying subject of this movie. I will however, admit that i think that some of this movie's brilliance was accidental. But whatever the reason for its brilliance, it was, indeed, brilliant.What would compel 300 men too engage in a war against millions in which there is no possible hope for victory? Would any of us be willing to have the courage to do that? In a country were we are constantly bombarded with how evil we are, Im guessing it would be a hard thing for many of us too understand why 300 men would willingly die without question for their homeland.So how do you portray men willing to do this to an audience that does not relate?? You give them mystical bright red capes, giant shields and unlimited stamina. You make them uncompromisingly brave. You make them god like in the art of war. You do all of this to create a feeling of iron clad immortality. This movie was mystical, artistic, emotional and to be quite frank beautiful. This movie wasn't about the men with the ""total gym abs"" it was about what they represented, a mystical, immortal feat in history. A feat that will never be forgotten. But there are enough holes in the history of this battle to create a imaginative shroud of make believe story telling.

Just a step away from greatness.,"When I first saw previews for this movie, I got a very strong ""looks too cool to be good"" feeling. I love comic-based films and was hoping to be as pleasantly surprised with 300 as I was with V for Vendetta. This film delivers on so many levels, but for me, falls just short of greatness.It is visually stunning, and I don't just mean artistically - ladies, the men in this film rate a solid 10 (hot, hot, hot). I also loved Lena Heady as Queen Gorgo. I actually cheered out loud for her - this is a great modern female character. The chemistry between her and Gerard Butler was riveting and, in my opinion, carried the film. I enjoyed the pithy dialog and can't wait to replay a few scenes on DVD.On the flip side, the opening of the film was a dud. The scenes of Leonidas growing up could have been cut. I understand they're trying to explain the Spartan warrior culture, but it just didn't launch me into the story. Although the violence in the film is stylized, I still had to turn away now and then. I was also annoyed by the narration - it was frivolous and distracting. I thought the acting in the film teetered between brilliance and melodrama, but my husband described it simply as ""cheesy.""Overall, I liked it, but I think they made some mistakes which kept the film from reaching its potential. It felt like a pulled punch - it lacked the impact I was expecting.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Hogwash.,"Big bang special effects, black lighting blue and green screens, buffed up actors, no style as far as widescreen is concerned, no good at making an impression on anyone but numb skulled audience members (of which there are obviously many of) to a certain degree. Shall I keep on going? Supposedly based on true events, fictionalized for novel purpose, and blown over the top and out the old proverbial dumper for theaters, this film was a D.O.A. from the second the company logo played. It has all the intensity of a dog taking a bowel movement. Halfway through the film I was sitting in the theater asking myself, 'just what exactly is this about again?' and then it hit me how horrendous the filmmakers visions were.It was just that which made this film so bad, clashing visions. And you can see it in the trailers and promotional material for this film. On one hand, you have actors working out their damned hardest to get into lean shape, and make their characters stand out, but of course falling into the age old Hollywood Blockbuster curse, they are eclipsed by the way they look and no one even cares about where they have been or where they are going. There is no depth, there is only look, and looks. Poor actors, such as Gerard Butler, Dominic West, and David Wenham, giving it their all, and for what? So people can take a look at their chests, muscles, and rear ends. They give the film nothing more. No spunk, no attitude. Nothing. And that's just the start. All the special effects that it took to make the film also fall futile. There is really nothing impressive about the ultra super imposed grainy look given to battle sequences, the MTV fast-slow quick camera movement that has become clich√© in the last few years of bad movies, and the horrible use of music throughout the film. All it does is show that too many people had one too many hands in this film, that they all crashed and this film burned because of it. What I'm getting at is that this film is a poor man's 'Gladiator' with sped up camera changes, blaring guitar music that is supposed to 'elevate' the tension of the fight scenes (it doesn't) and actors supposed to look mighty and tough, but only look like homo-erotic male strippers. All this drawn together, too much 'creativity'(if that's what one would call it, I wouldn't though) strung together on God knows what, and mashed into a digital garbage can, this is what you get.There is nothing about 300 that is remotely moving. It has the depth of a bathtub, the feel of sand paper, the sound of grinding in your ears, the look of a comic book that was left outside in the rain for a few years, run over by a tow truck carrying the film crew to the studio to work on another film to redeem themselves from making this piece of stench, and then left on the shelf, you get the point.I could go on, but why bother? If you haven't gotten the point by now, you won't. Watch it at your own risk, and try not to use(loose) too many brain cells.This film is Hogwash.",1.0,Anonymous,Action
See it for what it IS.,"I was reading some comments on this movie, and I was not surprised to see all the Iranians and Muslims in general being upset. Venting their frustrations over a movie based on a comic book, is not surprising. This movie was not made as a documentary for the History channel, or as reference for history students. It was a movie, based on a graphic novel, from one of todays best. The acting, and the dialog could have been better, but overall, as a visual experience, it was pretty good. As far as the historical fact are concerned that some people are talking about, and crying like little children, let me say this. Though this movie doesn't portray the events accurately, the Persian empire WAS an empire constantly looking to expand AND take over other countries. This is how they became so big. They ALWAYS had their eyes on the Mediterranean coast because it was the ""Prime Realestate"" of the time. I mean they lived in deserts. The Mediterranean was like paradise for them. One problem though. They never made it through. They tried many times, but their efforts always came to a bloody end, the moment they reached Greece. The movie (though loosely) is based on only one of those battles. Their navy got obliterated in many occasions, as did their armies. This is a Movie. As such, and as the countless movies made based on battles, you will see exaggerations. Personally, I would have preferred the movie to be longer, allowing for some better character development, maybe even a bit darker without the ""tacky"" humorous one liners. And for all you people thinking it should portray your culture in a better way, let me say this. YOU should make your culture look better. Not a movie.Thank you for your time..",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Nice Action Film,"300 (2006)** 1/2 (out of 4)This adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel about three-hundred Spartan fighters who team up to do battle against the much larger Persians. King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) leads the Spartans as they fight to free themselves, their children and the future of their people. This film is basically a remake of the 1962 film THE 300 SPARTANS, which is probably unknown to many of the people who made this Zack Synder film a monstrous hit when it was first released. It's really pointless to compare the two films because both are going for something else so labeling this a ""remake"" might be unfair. With that said, I can certainly understand why many people would love this movie but to me there just wasn't enough of a connection to where I'd say I had a good time watching it. I'll admit that the battle scenes are full of great action and one can be impressed with their visual style but that's about all this movie was to me. Nothing but pure visual masturbating and after a while I need something more than just nice images. None of the characters are people we can care for. Why should we care for them? Because the movie tells you they're the good guys. There isn't a single character here that goes through any sort of development and even worse is that the majority of what we're looking out is just some sort of CGI creation so it's even harder to feel anything for them. Roger Ebert notes in his review a good point as it seems the bodies of the actors are all CGI so that they all feature a six pack. Is there a particular reason why the filmmakers thought all three-hundred of these men would have the same body style? I'm sure fans would say that the look is done on purpose and perhaps it was but it's just another example of why I personally couldn't connect to them. Yes, the effects are terrific but again, I just need something more than that. The performances are also fairly hard to judge because they don't have too much to work with and you also have to wonder how much is them and how much is a computer. I'm sure much of this sounds rather harsh and I'm sure it's fair to say that people aren't coming to a movie like this for a story, acting or any type of character development. That's fine but to me there's only so much a visually impressive film can do and that's what makes this a film worth viewing once but while you're going through it it's just hard to care for anything you're seeing.",,Anonymous,Action
"Visually beautiful, wonderfully acted film.","This film is a visual feast for the eyes. Gerard Butler is superb as King Leonidas. The courage of the characters, their strength, and their message gave the film its integrity. The choreographed fight scenes and the special effects were a pleasure to watch -- due to the ""artistic"" vision of Zach Snyder. These graphic scenes did not have the disturbing factor that most war movies carry with them, because they had a heightened sense of visual artistry, making reality, fantasy, which cleverly softened the effect of the violence. The art direction and lighting were impeccable. I did not expect this film to be so beautiful. It is haunting. A film you will not soon forget. Zack Snyder did a wonderful job.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"""Give them nothing! But take from them everything! ""","It seems there are only two or three movie releases each year that get me excited. 300 just happened to be one of those movies. Overall, while I enjoyed 300, it wasn't quite the movie I had hoped for. Part of the reason could be that I had over-hyped it in my mind to the point where no movie could live up to that lofty of an expectation. However, with a rating of 7/10, it should be obvious that there was plenty here for me to enjoy.To begin, the ""look"" of the film is phenomenal. The stylized visuals perfectly suit 300's graphic novel origins. The action scenes are breathtaking. There is enough slicing and dicing to make any action fan happy. Finally, I found the acting surprisingly good. Gerard Butler may get most of the notice, but most everyone gave a convincing and solid performance. I was especially impressed with Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo. She just seemed so real and natural.But where 300 falters, in my opinion, is in its extremes. Director Zack Snyder walks a fine line between these extremes and, for the most part, does so successfully. However, moments when historical accuracy bubble to the surface tend to put a drag on the film. Conversely, scenes and images that take 300 into the realm of fantasy and take it too far from its historical roots become all but absurd. It may be a small complaint to some, but this keeps me from rating 300 any higher.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

"Awesome, but completely over-hyped.","I just came home from seeing this visually stunning, but somewhat flawed film. I have been hearing so much about this movie, that it pretty much made me sick. Not in any forum could I avoid the buzz about ""300"". First I was hyped myself, but then people started stating that it's the best thing that they've ever seen, so I was expecting a masterpiece of modern cinema. How foolish of me. At the end of the film, I honestly wanted to scream ""That's it!?!?!"". There was one forum in particular that over-hyped the movie for me. However, I shouldn't reveal the name of this forum. Don't ask why, I have my reasons.So, about the film. While I was kind of disappointed with the film, on the way home I started remembering some scenes from it and slowly realized how awesome it actually was. It wasn't the great film I was expecting in the beginning, but overall, it's extremely entertaining, solidly acted out. It does contain numerous clich√©s, but then again, how could it not? I have nothing bad to say about the visual part of the film. It's just amazing to say the very least. However, I felt that the film was just lacking it's own special style. Half of the film reminded me of ""Gladiator"" or ""The Lord Of The Rings"". But still, this was just a minor put off.It's also heavily annoying how people tend to rate the film for it's historical accuracy(?). This is very unnecessary as this film is pure entertainment and must be viewed as such. This is definitely one of the year's best blockbusters, probably a contender for the best visual effects Oscar. If you want amazing visuals, cool battle scenes and more amazing visuals, go see this film.

Positively sinful.,"Absolutely remarkable movie! I can call it nothing else but simply sinful for the eye. This was due to the excellent graphics and skilled design in filming this movie. And also due to the amazing acting done and the beautiful characters developed in this story. I couldn't peel my eyes away if you asked me to. I am personally a sucker for epic movies. The ones that make your heart race, your eyes tear up, your fingers clench around the arm rests. The movies that make your hands fly upon your eyes because you can't bring yourself to watch it out of sheer fear, but you still leave a gap in between your fingers cause you just gotta watch it. And 300 did exactly this for me.The Spartan culture was captivating and not of the norm. The actors were full of talent and raw emotion. And when he yelled, I could feel it. Every fight scene is breathtaking for the action lover. The Spartan's skill in battle is so fluid and captivating. AMAZING! I don't want to spoil the plot line, so I won't say much more. But no matter if you love action movies or chick flicks, this is one of those movies that you just can't leave behind. And the visuals will stick with you long after this amazing 2 hours.

Not as racist as I was expecting.,"Having read articles about how racist the film was against Persians, I was hesitant to see the movie. When I did go with a friend from out of town, I was not only stunned by the cinematography, but I was surprised to find that it didn't seem that racist at all. While it wasn't 100% historically accurate, it worked as a movie. I don't think many people really expect historical fiction films to be all that accurate these days, so that seems like a moot point to me. I will agree that the Persians are not shown in a great light, but it's also a film glorifying the 300 Spartans... like any film that has an unlikely victor, the enemy is made very unlikeable (I know that Ancient Persia was very civilized though it is true that Xerxes was more brutal than his predecessors). Whether that means that people who like the movie are racist is something very different. I know I'm not (my best friend is half-Iranian and my parents used to live in Iran). Perhaps because I haven't heard a single person actually interpret the film to justify racism other than people arguing against it for being racist in the first place, I don't find it to be a compelling point.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
it's tragic this movie was made at all,"This movie was garbage. It overdoes everything. Everyone overacts and there's way too much slow-mo.First of all, every scene in the movie, whether a simple conversation or an epic battle scene, ends in shouting. There is one emotion in the movie: anger. The protagonist, King Leonidas, shouts at his wife, a messenger, the Oracle, and every other character he has a conversation with. Next time try to create some 3-dimensional characters that experience more than one emotion.When I first saw the preview I noticed that the whole thing was in slow motion, but I just figured that they only took those scenes to use for it. But halfway through the movie I realized that about two-thirds of the movie up to that point was in slow-mo (the ratio remained fairly constant up to the end of the film). Every swing of a sword, thrust of a spear, and block of a shield was slowed to a fraction of real time. At first it was kind of entertaining, but it got pretty old pretty fast.Finally, there was absolutely no script in this movie. I understand that the dialog is supposed to be some sort of an old-school type lingo or whatever, but it still has to be interesting. Basically, there was no substance to the script. It completely relied on the slow-mo dance-o-gore performed by the ""actors"" in front of a green screen. Don't get me wrong, I usually love a good gore-fest with a sprinkling of unnecessary female frontal nudity, my favorite movie is Starship Troopers, but those are the only redeeming qualities the film possesses. However, there's still got to be some sort of a script, whether the acting is there or not.Oh yeah, and the whole movie is narrated.",3.0,Anonymous,Action

While he is assisted by an awesome supporting cast including Lena Headley as Queen Gorgo and Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes - it is upon Mr. Butler's broad shoulders that the success of the 300 rests. Well done! It's too bad there isn't room for a sequel.

Fantastic visuals and stunning battle sequences,"300 is based on history and deals with the Battle of Thermopylae which took place in 480 B.C. During this battle the King of Sparta led an army of 300 against over 100,000 Persians led by Xerxes. It was a battle that was said to have inspired all of Greece to band together against the Persians and defeat them. Enough with the history lesson. Lets talk about the movie shall we.The story comes from the graphic novel by Frank Miller (Sin City fame) and is filled with violence and fueled by testosterone. Gerard Butler plays the King of Sparta and leads 300 of his best into battle against the Persians whose overwhelming odds were stopped for three days and probably more if not for a betrayal which led to the death of all 300 Spartans, including King Leonidas himself. There is no real spoiler here because everybody knows how it turned out, after all it is based on history.The story is not as memorable as the visuals and battle sequences though which show limbs being hacked off and blood spraying. Most of the violence is done by computer graphics though, so it is not too horrific. It is the action and gore which kept me glued to my seat the whole entire 2 hour run. It also proves that an R rated movie can still raked in the millions as this movie has done for the past two weeks.The film is not great, but it was entertaining and kept your interest.

Pass the Popcorn! review,"Zack Snyder is probably one of the most divisive contemporary directors, with almost all of his movies completely polarizing the audience ‚Äì and his 2007 box office smash '300‚Ä≤ is no exception. I first saw this movie ‚Äì based on the Frank Miller comic book of the same name ‚Äì upon its theatrical release, when I was still a lad, and I quite enjoyed it (as an early teen, who wouldn't?). Fast forward 7 years, I decided to watch it again, to refresh my memory in preparation for the unnecessary sequel ‚Äì 300: Rise of an Empire. This time I wasn't as satisfied as when I first saw it. Actually, I thought it to be mindless and silly and I'm less enthusiastic about the sequel than ever.'300‚Ä≤ loosely portrays the Battle of Thermopylae during which the Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler), aided by 300 of his finest soldiers, stood against the mighty Persian empire, ruled by the self proclaimed god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) ‚Äì and that's pretty much the whole movie. Of course, there are some scenes depicting the Spartan way of life, and a subplot concerning Leonidas' wife, queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), trying to influence the Spartan council to send more soldiers to aid Leonidas, in spite of corrupted councilman Theron's (Dominic West) intentions too keep the army at bay, but all of this is utterly overshadowed by the movie's action sequences.With its thin plot and extreme historical inaccuracy, it wouldn't be an overstatement to call '300‚Ä≤ a style-over-substance movie. Not that that is necessary a problem, but some people (including myself) may find the movie to be bland if they want something more from a movie, instead of excessive violence nearly all the time, and in return get senseless scenes and poorly developed characters (one of the more prominent characters, played by Vincent Regan, is only called and credited as Captain, and his only character traits are that he has a son, and is a captain). As for the movie's style, '300‚Ä≤ is most famous for its unrestricted use of slow motion, which, to be honest, does look impressive when used correctly. However, more often than not, slow motion is used incorrectly and in certain scenes is simply unnecessary. Due to this incorrect use of slow motion, quite a few scenes in the movie look like excerpts from some music video, which isn't a good thing.'300‚Ä≤ definitely isn't a horrible movie. Like I said, some action sequences look truly impressive (which should be more than enough for action movie fanatics) and the movie does have the charm of a mindless popcorn flick. In fact, I think '300‚Ä≤ could have been more enjoyable and better if it had been somewhat less serious than it actually was. Without that little special something, '300‚Ä≤, in spite of its cool looking action scenes, some memorable quotes and characters, doesn't really stand the test of repeated viewings, at least not in my case.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Action

This movie is actually a original and Gladiator is the rip off.The book 300 came out in print in 1999 one year prior to the release of Gladiator(2000), making it the non-original movie in this case, even though 300 was made after it, but it is all from the book, it doesn't sway from the story much at all.All in all this movie was amazing and everyone should see it. The plot in this movie is great and the fight scenes are stupendous. The CGI are so real it looks like it is not CGI at all.Very well done, and props to Zack Snyder and Kurt Johnstad for making such a marvelous movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Bloody Awful,"300 Spartan men in underwear and capes go against a Persian army of tens of thousands and manage to cut off a lot of Persian body parts. The computer-generated imagery looks cold, gray, and depressing in this bloody recreation of the events of 480 BC, based on Miller's graphic novel. Unlike ""Sin City,"" another Miller work that was successfully transferred to the screen by Miller himself, this one fails miserably under the overwrought direction of Snyder. The acting consists of little more than flexed muscles and gnashed teeth. Snyder's obsession with slow motion is maddening. Without slow motion, used in every other scene for no apparent reason, the movie would only last about 42 minutes.",1.0,Anonymous,Action
"This was solid, but not perfect, and not as bad as some want you to think","First off, this movie is loosely based on a graphic novel that was loosely based on oral history. This movie is not meant to be realistic. It is not meant to be much more than entertaining and absolutely beautiful to look at. That it was. To those that complain about lack of plot, there was plot, the battle, and subplot, the council's deciding to supply more men for the battle. Admittedly, these were relatively simple, but this movie wasn't supposed to have an intricate plot. The writing was spotty at points, but the acting more than made up for it. Sometimes it was over the top, but it was sincere, and being that it was supposed to be an oral tale, the whole thing was EXAGGERATED. That is the point. Elephants and rhinos tower over men. Deformities cover the entire body of a man. This movie was not made to be an accurate retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae. That said, it was highly entertaining and very well made. It is solidly the first ""all-blue-screen"" movie I've seen that I have truly liked. Know about a movie before you see it, so you don't complain about it on reviews, please.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Wonderful wonderful,"I've heard of Sin City but have not seen it. But after seeing this, I'll try my best to get a copy of Sin City. What a breath-taking movie 300 is. This is what a movie is supposed to be -- it should move you, entertain and suck you in for the whole 90 minutes or more you are in the cinema. Never mind if its historically incorrect. Movies are never meant to represent real life. For real life, go read the news -- which are at times even stranger than fiction! I was totally bowled over by the visuals, the sound and the actors. The grainy and out of worldly color of the movie, helped in placating the faint hearted, to the scenes of decapitations, limbs flying off in different directions. The soundtrack was most apt. The rock music weaved seamlessly into the ancient setting of the movie quite magically. I've seen movies where they tried to weave modern music into period drama movies and the results were most horrible it made you cringe (one movie that comes to mind is the utter waste-of-time, inappropriate and highly embarrassing Keith Ledger vehicle, A Knight's Tale). The transformation of the actors in this movie is quite amazing. After watching Gerard Butler in Phantom of the Opera last weekend, his appearance in this movie reflected how hard he must have worked to transform it-- his buffed up body (even his nose looked totally buffed up -- like a boxer's nose) made him barely recognizable as the actor who had sung his way through the whole musical. Watch out for Stephen McHattie, the underrated blonde actor who once acted as James Dean in a telemovie, a goatish looking loyalist who helps the queen gain access to the Council. David Wenham (who was the gentle yet brave Faramir in the Lord of the Rings trilogy) is the storyteller here. Pretty boy (i.e. drop-dead gorgeous) Rodrigo Santoro is transformed into the gigantic and totally corrupt Xerxes (plus body piercings, khol lined eyes, and painted eyebrows -- who looks suspiciously like Kumar, a comedian who's a household name in Singapore). What can I say?? I love this movie. Good job! Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Orgasmic,"300 is a plethora of awesomeness. Awesomeness that only magnificent testosterone-driven battle scenes can deliver. And deliver they did! Oh, how the blood and limbs fly! I'm not a sadistic violence-loving fan of Hostel or anything, but while watching 300 I was constantly bloodthirsty for more. More of that awesome regular-mo/slow-mo Persian ass-kicking that Gerard Butler proved to be great at. Every battle scene was a superb montage of blood and guts, interlaced with Persians falling off cliffs and Butler and company shouting chilling battle chants.300's cinematography was dazzling, although much of this was more post-production work than camera work. Nonetheless, Sparta, wilderness, and the ""Hot Gates"" are all mesmerizing to look at: think a talented artist's depiction combined with realistic CGI to create surreal dreamscapes of an epic scale.Undoubtedly, this film's selling point is its monumental action sequences, but I have to credit the acting of both Gerard Butler and Lena Headey, here, too. Butler, who I haven't really noticed before, is now at the forefront of my favorite actors. He's intense, serious, and unflinchingly awesome as King Leonidas. If I was ever to go into battle, I'd be happy to have him there. His character's wife, played by Lena Headey, was also terrific. Women tend to take the backseat in movies like this, but she played her character with strength and conviction, allowing her to shine in several of her scenes.I was drooling for most of this movie. It was just so utterly amazing in a number of ways, especially, again, in its battle scenes. I'm confident that this movie will be received well for years to come, that it will age like fine wine. Red wine, if you catch my drift...",10.0,Anonymous,Action

"Not Historically Accurate, but who cares?","Okay, so 300 isn't going to win any awards for historical accuracy, or even for stellar writing or acting. It's a movie meant to show how a handful of Spartans marched to the Hot Gates and made a bloody mess out of the Persian army.And if that's all the filmmakers had done, it would have been a grand action/war movie. It's interesting visually, the fight choreography, while not revolutionary, was entertaining, and the pacing of the movie was fast enough to keep my butt from ever getting numb.But noooooooooooooooooo. They had to try to inject some idiotic story in there about freedom and free men and free men fighting for freedom. Oh, and there's some throw away back story that takes place back in Sparta involving politics and the Queen, and blah, blah, blah.THAT stuff was boring. Mind numbingly so. The previews promised me blood and guts and that's all I wanted to see and all of this politics crap is like lettuce on a burger - a feeble attempt to inject some wholesomeness into a completely, irredeemably unhealthy bundle of fun. I didn't give a rat's rear about the queen, about the politicking she and her Abraham Lincoln-looking ally had to engage in, or any of that and if they'd cut it out wholesale they might have stuffed in another fight scene or two.It's worth seeing on the big screen but might be a more enjoyable experience on DVD since you would be able to skip all those stupid, talking bits.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Action
A testosterone fuelled dark fantasy epic,"300 is one of those great action films that doesn't ask much of the viewer and simply rewards them with great fight cinematography.The director has been able to turn ancient Greek history into a overplayed and fictional dark fantasy, reminiscent of the ""Conan the Barbarian"" fantasy films. Here, the Persians have supernatural monsters and dinosaurs in their ranks as well. Not exactly period accurate.It certainly gives the teenage boys everything they're after: an orgy of male camaraderie, salacious female nudity, blood, violence, death, horror, gore, and video-game CGI. Of course, there has to be over-the-top comic book scenes and highly memorable quotes and unlikely dialogue that can easily be turned into memes. To wash it all down, there's also period correct... heavy metal music?This is something you're either going to love or hate - probably depending on how old and mature you are. There's not much to the story other than some common, if two-dimensional, tropes of good and evil.You're watching this for some spectacular cinematography, and don't get me wrong, it's great. I'm sure it inspired a number of video and games and other films with the art style. Much like John Wick films, however, the cinematography is all it has to recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
A Story of Victory and Triumph,"Sometimes I wonder what critics are looking for when they watch a movie, most people could care less about cinematography or color highlights. People nowadays want a good story or good plot they can follow and most of all they want something they can feel is real and gives them an energy about life. This story of defying the odds against treachery and narcissism was very appealing, very empowering and very uplifting. We live in a world that worries so much about violence, but violence in this film is necessary to the degree that these men held back nothing to save the lands and families. I read the history of the battle and was even more intrigued how the twists and turns of the characters were made to give it that extra humph. Please don't rely on the critics for this one.

For Technical Achievement And Promoting Myth,"Why are people up in arms about...a comic book? I laugh at the ones who take this movie as anything less than visceral entertainment. The saying goes b ""if the myth is more entertaining than facts, print the myth"" And so Persians are up in arms about historical accuracy,I actually saw this flick on the Persian New Year and started laughing about the timing of the screening.The movie is a pure cartoon. If Gerard Butler isn't screaming his lines, he's fighting in ramp speed. The myth is too good to not tell in this fashion. I would also say, you are dealing with Frank Miller. In the same vain as ""Sin City"" the colors seems so surreal fake it's impossible not to just go along for the ride.It is a comic book. Repeat 100 times.That said, the performances are very theatrical and staged. At some points so cornball I doubt Butler will look back with fondness. Lena Heady, who plays Queen Gorgo, is very good. With stoic pride she takes one for the team.Overall, again, it is a comic book and should be enjoyed as such. Not a serious take at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Although I did enjoy seeing the lack of armor on the men, save for the helmets and shields, and the six- and twelve-packs being paraded around! The movie is about courage in the face of overwhelming odds. Both the characters of King Leonidas and Queen Gorgo were admirable and appealing.

Hyper-stylised ancient battles in a gem of action cinema,"Many critics have criticised this movie, because it's not ""historically accurate"". They're missing the point. 300 is NOT supposed to represent the ancient Battle of Thermopylae ‚Äì instead, it's supposed to represent the 5-part comic book, released by SIN CITY creator Frank Miller in 1998. I've read the comic, and I'm delighted to say that 300 is utterly faithful to the storyline depicted therein, which is basically the historical story with added fantastical touches and plenty of coolness.I'm a huge, huge fan of ancient warfare so I came to see this film with great expectations. All of them were fulfilled. 300 is a testosterone-packed movie with plenty to recommend it. 90% of the film was shot with green-screen backgrounds, so that the majority of backdrops and locations in the film are computer generated. They look fantastic; far from realistic, but beautiful all the same.While the story of the film ‚Äì fighting, corruption, betrayal ad infinitum ‚Äì is simplistic and the scenes taking place at the royal court very much par for the course, where this movie really excels is in the battle scenes. The fights are plentiful and superbly staged. Nowhere else have I got a better idea of what it was like fighting on the front line than I have by watching this film. Hyper-stylised by director Zack Snyder (who previously directed the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake), the various battles are full of originality and very gruesome ‚Äì just the way we like them. CGI blood splatters across the screen, limbs fly in slow motion through the air, and every male viewer will be whooping with delight.The cast members are pretty good. Gerard Butler and co. might not look or sound like ancient Greeks, but they seem to be born fighters and their perfectly-sculpted bodies give the movie an added dimension that recalls the look of the old sword and sandal movies of the '50s and '60s. Butler nabs all of the best lines and enjoys some wonderful shouty bits ‚Äì ""This is Sparta!"" etc., all stirring stuff. Vincent Regan is very good as his loyal, emotional captain and David Wenham (LORD OF THE RINGS) reminds us that his presence in fantastic epics is a given. The rest of the cast is also decent, whether it's Rodrigo Santoro's creepy Persian king Xerxes or Lena Headey's headstrong queen.And so back to the battles, which take up roughly half of the movie's running time. We get Spartans battling Persians, as well as assorted creatures like elephants and a rhinoceros. The ninja-clad Immortals prove to be entertaining opponents and the movie benefits from plenty of grimness, like the wall of bodies built up by the heroes. My favourite scene by far is where Leonidas battles the massive giant, who seems to be as immortal as he is. The central theme of the movie concentrates on what it means to be a hero and the inevitable conclusion is moving while at the same time fittingly heroic. All in all, this is a wonderful battle film that works on many levels and is sure to go down as a minor classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
For Sparta and for your own mood!!!,"I might be mistaken but I think this movie is intended to be cool. And boy was it cool! A friend of mine recommended this movie to lift the spirits of my boyfriend, who had a bit of an off-day then. I decided to watch it with him and be a supportive girlfriend but I never thought I'd actually enjoy it as I thought it was one of these 100% testosterone movies that are just full of battle screams and clashing swords. My expectations turned out not to be entirely wrong. I just discovered I really love that!Also, I realised that it's not just dumb violence. I thought the way the Spartans, though fewer in numbers, fought 'as one' compared to the very eccentric and individualist Persians were very inspiring as a group. It also makes you understand why dying in battle is often considered an honour. There are few female characters in the movie; actually only one I can think of but she is strong and respectable. The way Leonidas's wife handles the situation really makes you sympathise with her. It was weirdly refreshing, an almost exclusively male cast. Don't ask me why... Maybe because you know there won't be any mushy I-don't-know-which-guy-to-pick love stories attached.Of course there are all these cool one-liners like: ""I hope you had good breakfast, cause tonight we dine in Heeel!"" and ""Freedom isn't free at all.

"A Visually Stunning, Beautifully Written Bloodbath.","I found 300 to be startling in its graphic portrayal of a battle of 300 against thousands. While it was reminiscent of both Helm's Deep and the battle on Pelennor Plains, it still retained a feeling all its own. Some critics have compared this work against Jackson's, but I don't think that's appropriate. This film stood alone and stood without assistance. I don't see any reason to make the comparison.This was a brilliant work of cinematic art...it was a visually stunning, beautifully written bloodbath.If you like loads of brilliant action, good writing, beautiful acting, and lots of gore, you not only could do worse than 300, but you probably already have, and loved it.But beneath all that, the timing for this movie seems political. Here, you have 300 Spartans standing against hundreds of thousands of terrifying invaders led by Xerxes who believes himself a God, while the Spartan senate refuses to send in the Spartan army to assist these brave warriors in their stand to defend all of Sparta. This clearly parallels the current Congressional position wherein they refuse to send in more troops or allocate appropriate funding to assist our soldiers already in the field.I think this is the most compelling draw this work has for American audiences, today. I also admire the marketing of this work, as a fine example of marketing genius.300 is a must see.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Explosive to the Extreme!!!,"Only the hard and strong can be called Spartan. 300 is a film that brings forth the same intensity and passion to film-making that the Spartan warriors they portray bring to the battlefield. Visually stunning frame-by-frame with sword clashing, bone crushing audio that creates the same impact to the film.The Spartans are beasts. A whole army of 300 bloodthirsty soldiers... an 8-pack of abs seems to be a mere requirement. King Leonidas is so fierce and hardcore, he makes Achilles and dare I say Maximus look like Ben and Jerry.With each fleet that King Leonidas and his army of 300 Spartans must endure, comes new surprises and new challenges that keep the audience wondering if or how they will survive. The fights are unsparingly brutal and innovative, beautifully shot. And the scenes aren't just blood, sweat and gore. Although you get all that and more, the fun is also in witnessing the different tactics the 300 use to outsmart and overpower the Persian Army. One thing that sets the 300 battle scenes from Troy, Gladiator, or Braveheart are the wide assortment of creatures they are forced to do battles with. I guarantee you will not find a goat playing a sitar in any other movie but this. I will say no more.Even the love scene is shot so intimately and passionately with the same intensity as the battle scenes. (By the way, on a side note, isn't funny how an audience giggles when there's a naked man, and goes dead silent when it's a naked woman?) Anyway...The Queen is just as powerful as the warrior king. She has the challenge of gaining the support of the rest of Greece to join in her husband's fight against the Persian Army. She's so likable and respectable, you have her back the whole way through.So far the Frank Miller series is 2 for 2! This is a film not to be missed.

Totally Unethical movie picture,"According to all historical documents, this movie is fraudulent and distorted, and its broadcast guarantees the violation of undeniable international legal rights.It is a proved scholarly fact that the Persian Empire in 480 B.C was the most magnificent and civilized empire. Established by the Cyrus the great, the writer of the first human right declaration, Persians ruled over significant portions of Greater Iran, the east modern Afghanistan and beyond into central Asia; in the north and west all of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), the upper Balkans peninsula (Thrace), and most of the Black Sea coastal regions; in the west and southwest the territories of modern Iraq, northern Saudi-Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt and as far west as portions of Libya. Having twenty nations under control, encompassing approximately 7.5 million square kilometers, unquestionably the Achaemenid Empire was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.Based on the Zoroastrian doctrine, it was the strong emphasis on honesty and integrity that gave the ancient Persians credibility to rule the world, even in the eyes of the people belonging to the conquered nations (Herodotus, mid 5th century B.C). Truth for the sake of truth, was the universal motto and the very core of the Persian culture that was followed not only by the great kings, but even the ordinary Persians made it a point to adhere to this code of conduct.I must add that the simple most obvious details that they could take care of in the movie, the clothing and their appearance of ancient Persians are totally counterfeit. Persians did not pierce their bodies. They were the first nation to introduce clothes that fit the body, invention of sleeves and trousers. They had very fare skin, long dark hair and green or light brown eyes as is still seen on the walls of Persepolis and paintings from that time. These are neglected because they knew that this appearance would give them a very warm, kind and humanitarian look.",1.0,Anonymous,Action
A Rootin' Tootin' Heroic movie!,"You may have noted that the movie ""300!"" is clobbering all competitors at the box office, seen varying reviews, and wondered if it was worth it. In a word, absolutely!The plot is true, and well-known. In the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC an alliance of Greek city-states fought the invading Persian army in the mountain pass of Thermopylae. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Persian King Xerxes led an Army of well over 300,000 men to Greece and was confronted by King Leonidas of Sparta and 300 Spartans (plus some Athenians). He offers them terms/promises/bribes to stand aside and join his empire, and they choose to fight, knowing they will all die, while the folks back home debate about whether to send reinforcements..Thar's the bare bones of it, but doesn't cover the truly glorious film that is 300! The photography, enhanced by computer graphics, is shockingly beautiful. The dialogue and acting is terrific. Gerrad Butler's King Leonidas makes Russell Crowe's Maximus (Gladiator) look like a choir boy in comparison. Can't see how you could do better short of Richard Burton. There is an excellent extensive female part, and it would be a mistake to think of this as just a ""guy's' movie"". There is even some definite humor. My wife loved it. You WILL be drawn in and emotionally involved. Quite a few audiences seem to applaud at the end. They should.You may have heard this is violent. Well,sort of. It is a genuine epic with many fight scenes. The film editor never uses the same camera angle twice, and the combination of color and shading makes for an absolute beautiful vision. Much thought had also been put into the music, and sound effects chosen by the director. But there really is little blood and no spilled innards, though there are antiseptic severed limbs and heads.You may have heard that this is a ""political'"" movie, and it is true the the Iranians are not fond of it. I didn't see it that way. Greece WAS the foundation of Democracy and Western Civilization, and the invading army WAS Persian.

This is not to lessen the role of women for Queen Gorgo is a complete and compelling character that complements her husband near perfectly. Certainly not a politically correct film because the film clearly defines the basic differences between the sexes. One is not better than the other, just different.

"Poor camera-work, bad editing and a dire script... but somehow fun.","300 is a film littered with poor camera-work, bad editing and has the unfortunate luck of being lumbered with a dire script. The only redeeming features are its stunning visuals, which do manage to set it apart from its Hollywood contemporaries. 300 is a film that has apparently been heralded as an epic of battle like proportions (which it is not), it is visually though as exciting and pioneering as the cult-classics ""Tron"", ""Back to the Future II"" and even ""Willow"" and this is because upon release it has showed some sort of visual cinematic progress, yet it is likely that this is also the reason it will be a cult film in many years to come. Subsequently Zack Snyder's utilisation of some slow motion, CGI and irrelevant narrative cutaways turn probably an hours worth of film footage into two - and it shows.300 attempts to build credibility on the ideals of loyalty and honour, but it is no ""Gladiator"". The fight scenes are poorly choreographed (the fast pace editing only illustrates this further) and the tight use of camera-shots fail to transpire on anything less than a very large television¬Ö I did feel that this type of camera work in the battle/fight scenes was only employed to gloss over the poor choreography. I also felt that the lack of establishing shots prior to battle scenes failed to give any sense isolation among the Spartans or any feeling of companionship, the explanation of loyalty and camaraderie has only be left to the poor script. Snyder has tried too hard to stylise the fighting and battle scenes and although it looks good, it serves no real narrative purpose apart from a few moments, the most note worthy being the decapitation of the young Spartan and the scarring of Xerxes.Finally, the only gratification for 300 is for those that were fortunate to see it at the cinema or who have a 46inch HDTV, but if you're really after good visuals then buy an X-Box and indulge yourself in the cut-scenes of Halo 3 because that is that is where the films real competition lies, in a video game!",6.0,Anonymous,Action

They are all hypocrites and have no logic. Ignore them and see this movie - it is sure to entertain you.Gerald Butler does a fantastic job as the king of the Spartans - bringing him to life - as does many of the other actors. Zack Snyder did a great job directing this movie and bringing all of the elements into your lap. This is a great flick. I loved the graphic nature of it - so well done with CGI filling in many places and you would never know it. What a ride! 10 out of 10.-LDPS: I just saw Pathfinder before this and felt nothing for any of the characters as they failed to bring them to life. Pathfinder is definitely well made, and from the director's commentary, achieved everything he was going for ... except making you care about the characters._______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Well nice movie but...,"I remember when i first heard about the movie 300. I instantly thought that it was based on Steven Pressfields ""Gates of Fire"", by far the best book i ever read. And woooow was i excited and anxious to watch this movie. I remember when i finished reading this book how i thought that ""Gates of Fire"" as a movie would own Braveheart. But than i found out that this movie is an adaptation of Frank Millers novel, and well i thought it can't be much different right? Well i was wrong. The historical mistakes aren't the problem, the reality mistakes are. I mean Persians portrayed as LOTR type creatures is simply wrong. This transformed this historical event into total fantasy. Besides this the movie was good, nice drama, nice score and great action. So the movie is is good, but it should have been one of the greatest.Well i guess people who never read ""Gates of Fire"" won't understand what i'm talking about, but for us, fans of Pressfields masterpiece this makes sense.There's nothing left for now but to wait and hope that one day somebody will make a movie based on ""Gates of Fire"". Until then we have 300.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
A wonderful story,"I've gotten a little tired of hearing some of the same complaints about '300' over and over. I don't think people have really thought this through. I personally thought it was a wonderful adventure full of everything I wanted to see at the theater. I'm a fan of all sorts of movies and I could tell from the previews that this was not one that was going to make me think, that's what movies like 'Children of Men' are there for. This movie was made to entertain and certainly pulled it off. It was exactly the kind of story that the old Greek fathers would tell their sons about their descendents; emphasizing every triumph, making the enemy look worse and worse, creating the idea of 'heroes' in the minds of all Greeks. I noticed that a lot of people were angry at the fact that the movie stressed patriotism so much. Now, if you look at it from the context of out current situation in the Middle East, yes, I can see that you may consider this kind of a subliminal message. But if you ever read 'The Iliad' or 'The Odyssey' you'd know that heroism, patriotism, and death on the battle field were some of the most honored and glorified things in Greek culture. This movie wasn't made to make people think ""Hmm, maybe I should fight in Iraq,"" or ""Hey, what are my morals?"" It was made to make people say ""That was awesome, I'm going back to see it again.""",8.0,Anonymous,Action
There's a lot of hate...and a lot more love. I loved it,"This movie was just a great piece of work hands down. Everyone who had seen this movie before me had told me countless good things about this movie so I decided to give it a shot and was not let down at all. The battle scenes were intense..the love scenes served their purpose, and well during the movie you got a brief laugh or two before it got back to the superb action that this movie delivers. The only reason people would hate this movie is because of gore...and if there were some factual errors. I loved it even though there was a bit more gore than I usually see. The movie was over all wonderful and I am glad that I gave this movie a chance.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
A visual spectacle! A graphic adapation! A male movie!,"There are probably 300 reasons why you should watch 300. Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, it is loosely based on the Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans fought against the Persians. The odds are against them: A million to 300. Yet the strength, courage, determination and intelligence of the Spartans proved that in war, it isn't always about numbers.300 will appeal to many. Comic fans should be blown away by the stylish cinematic visual effects, seen previously in Sin City. It stays true to the novel, matched picture by picture. A background of desaturated with high contrast tones of red, visuals filmed almost completely on blue screen, gave a surreal yet bloody look. Look out for a sensual scene between King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and Queen (Lena Headey), a combination of cartoon-meets-sex.Its 'epicness' has been compared to the likes of Troy and Lord of the Ring. While perhaps so in magnitude and special effects, it could have been lacking in terms of the story element and a slightly weak screenplay.People may also find 300 reasons to hate it. The female audience may find 300 to be a violent exhibition with mutilated body parts and chopped hairs. Like a period Saw or Hostel, it may be seen as a display of 'meal market', sadistic and overly-exaggerated.Before you dismiss it as being unbelievable, the battle did take place in 400 BC with 300 Spartans and 700 Thespian volunteers. The 300 warriors were in fact made up of 150 pairs of 'male-lovers', the king believing that they would fight harder for survival with their loved ones right beside them. This aspect was hinted throughout the film, from a pair of 'male-friends', the androgynous Persian King, and the queen's sacrifice towards the end.The female's role in the movie was really quite minimal, especially when the film is marred by the queen's lack of acting classes. It can be said as a 'male movie'√¢¬Ä"" which will appeal from the young teenager who loves comic fares and the older men who craves for action, blood, and aggression.In fact, this movie will inspire me to hit the gym harder right now for that 8 pec abs. This is SPARTA!300 - A visual spectacle! A graphic adapation! A male movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Beautiful and savage,"The battle of Thermopylae was one of the most significant of the ancient world, giving definition to the notion of Greek strength. It was a tale that was retold to emphasise the bravery of the 300 Spartan warriors. The film does the job of retelling the battle beautifully, and conveying its importance.Each shot is beautiful and watching the film is like looking at a succession of film posters. The battle scenes were gruesomely beautiful, but more importantly very well edited, so that the narrative of the battle was easy to follow.The film clearly owes a lot to recent cinema milestones, the use of the rhino and elephants and the appearance of the Persians, came straight from Lord of the Rings, and the slow motion shots follow clearly from The Matrix.The film was also very funny at moments, where it intended to be. I wasn't sure why there were subtitles - perhaps people felt that the English accents would be hard to understand, but I thought everyone enunciated very well.The film had the unremitting ferocity of The Passion of the Christ, and did not set out to question the morality of the protagonists, but such concerns are probably best left to documentary makers. 300 has dramatic impact and stunning imagery, it deserves to be counted as a masterpiece of film-making.",,Anonymous,Action
A very entertaining movie.,This movie is almost purely an entertainment piece. It really does not have much of a plot and what it does have its very simple and straight forward. The acting is done well from most of the actors. Some of the side actors were guilty of over acting in a variety of scenes which was upsetting. The visuals were pretty to look at and the battle scenes done well and intense. Its not the most historically accuarate movie but its still good.This movie is about the king of Sparta who is told that the persians are coming to take over Greece. He tries to bring the spartan army to go battle the persians but the council does not let him. So he takes 300 body guards with him to guard a pass that the persians have to cross through. Its a very narrow path between two cliffs so the thousands of thousands of persians really don't have the advantage against the highly trained spartans.This movie was really good but a few points were somewhat disappointing. Like the fact it was not historically accuarte and the side actors who were not so good other then that pretty good movie.,7.0,Anonymous,Action
Stylised history,"OK, firstly, as a historian I recognized the various inaccuracies in the movie. However since I am also a comic book nerd I was more than willing to move beyond them and see what they did to a great graphic novel which is artistically based on the Battle of Thermopylae. For this to work, they would really have to do something different. And they have. The atmosphere that they have created for this film is nothing short of breathtaking. It's not the actors nor the effects, nor the camera work, nor the soundtrack but all of it coming together to make a feeling that is incredibly involving. 300 is a movie that has done for history what Sin City did for Film Noir. It doesn't take it past a point of no return, but it takes elements of a genre and mixes them with a magic ingredient- Frank Miller's mind.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
An Insane Experience,"Basically just Gladiator if it took steroids. The visuals are really, really impressive, as is the score and production design. The film really immersed me in this era. The actual story is a bit bare-boned, and none of the emotional moments particularly work, but lets be honest - no one watches this film for the emotional moments. We come for the action, which is just as gory as you'd expect it to be, and worked really well for me on the whole. It helps that the blood is so striking due to the dark and clearly digitally altered colour palette. The ending overstayed its welcome a fair bit, and by the final ten minutes the slow-mo felt really tiresome and I just kind of wanted it to end a bit earlier. But overall, I did enjoy this absolutely bonkers film, and fans of gory action and slow-mo will definitely enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"War movie of high quality, with memorable scenes!!!","I enjoyed a lot this movie...it had both adventure and unpredictability...The actors, beginning with Gerard Butler and Lena Headey, played their roles in a splendid manner...I also enjoyed the main concept of this film: fighting and dying with honor to protect the freedom of one and of its people, and also trying to do the impossible...I remember also a historical event , when the Ruler of 15 century of Valachia, Vlad Dracula the Impaler managed in a night attack to destroy an Ottoman army of 1million men, with troupes of 30 times lower...But there it was all about strategy...A main flaw in this movie that bothered me was the lack of strategy...I mean , the Spartan army managed to kill a lot of Persian troupes, but it didn't had a plan so as to guarantee the victory...Beside this and some scenes that weren't as logical as i expected, this movie was great.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
It's good! (Sorry. A lot of shouting in this movie),"Typically I detest the kind of over-stylized action favored by Hollywood post-'The Matrix', but Zack Snyder's '300' looks like Frank Miller's graphic novel in motion, and all of its many (many) exaggerations ultimately serve it well.The cast isn't given much to do save for look buff and scream, but Gerard Butler is fiercely charismatic as the warrior king Leonidas, and David Wenham gives as standout performance as his chronicler and fellow warrior, Dilios. Narrating the movie, Wenham adds a nice bit of wry panache to a film that otherwise takes itself very seriously despite its over the top style.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

STORY telling at it's COMIC BOOK finest!,"I really am tired of people complaining about both the historical accuracy and homo-eroticism. For the people that don't know, put down your trashy romance novels and expand your library! It's a STORY to be told around a campfire kind of like how Christian's used to tell stories of giant horned men (vikings) raping and pillaging the world. They never wore horns it was used in STORY telling to make them more menacing and thus causing more fear in the listening audience. And for those of you who think the movie was homo-erotic quit trying to make the world more like your, homophobic, self. It's not cool. Now that I'm past that, the movie is about 90% pure to the book and a spectacular film to watch. It's about time people started recognizing Frank Miller, and giving him the credit he is long overdue.

Gloriously over the top but I liked it!,"I have to start off by saying that this movie will never be described as subtle.It smashes you over the head like a sledgehammer.I had read pretty mixed reviews but like every other movie I have ever seen,I decided to make up my own mind.I was pretty impressed.Just about everything in '300' is over the top.The acting,the use of slow motion,the battle scenes,everything.But the thing is that it works.It will not be everyones cup of tea but it will appeal to a lot of people.I have to say that the thing that impressed me most was the overall look of the film.It looks fabulous from beginning to end.It isn't in the same league as 'Gladiator' which I have heard it compared to,but it is a fine piece of work.Just be prepared to have your senses bashed!!I think that I ended up viewing this movie as a kind of live action comic book.It IS historically inaccurate,you DO have to suspend belief at times.But I think the whole point of this movie is for it to entertain.Each scene was like turning over a page in a comic and I really do think that many people would enjoy it more if they looked at it this way.You can't take it too seriously but I still maintain that the film definitely works in the context of good looking entertainment.It is as camp as a row of tents,way over the top and a macho overdose.Ultimately though,as a piece of comic book action,it IS a film worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
300,"300 is based on the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. The film takes place in 5th century B.C. and is about the battle of Thermopylae in which 300 Spartan soldiers lead by King Leonidas fought Xerxes and the Persian army. The film shows us several of the battles until one side finally won. The film uses real actors, but was filmed in front of a blank screen and then the background was made digitally and many of what you end up seeing is digital including some of the animals in the movie, the background as I already mentioned and right down to the gore from the battle scenes. Having really liked the film Sin City which was based on graphic novels by Frank Miller and was also a film he co-directed I was waiting in a lot of anticipation for 300. Overall, I was fairly impressed, but I did have a few problems with the film that would have otherwise probably lead me to give it a higher rating. I will start off with my few negatives about the film. First of all the dialogue in the film was not very good. There is not a lot of conversations in this film seeing as most of it is battles, but when the characters did talk their vocabulary consisted of lines that you would only find in a non very well written comic book. I realize comic books or graphic novels aren't known for having great dialogue and conversations, but having also read the Sin City graphic novels I felt that they often had very good conversations and in the stories that required narration I thought it worked quite well. Maybe I'm being a little hard on the film for this seeing as it does take place in the 5th century and a film about battles isn't supposed to sound like a Shakespeare play, so maybe I should cut it a little bit of slack, but still I thought the characters could have talked a little better and said things that would not later be considered something that would later turn into some sort of catchphrase for wrestling or something in the same vain. The only other complaint I had about the film was the pacing. At times the film moved really well and I was really getting into it which was great, but there were a few scenes that kind of dragged on for me and had they been edited or arranged a little differently I thought it could have had a bigger impact on me and would have drawn me closer into the film. Those being my only flaws of the film I will get to the positives of it. I will start by saying that the way they digitally made this film makes it look gorgeous and I really liked the style of the film that was really enhanced by this look. Except for a few scenes the movie moved fairly well and at one point I was surprised the movie was already done by the time it was over. Also for a movie that relied heavily on stylized battle scenes for the most of it's running time the film did manage to entertain for most of that time whereas in other films it could have become tiresome and tedious. For being a great looking and action packed and entertaining film I will recommend 300, but don't go in looking for anything remotely historically accurate or to be blown away by acting and dialogue because you won't find that here. On the other hand what you may find may just be what you are looking for in a movie anyways.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Excellent film.,"Reguardless of some comments this is in fact an excellent film I first saw with my girlfriend who enjoyed it as much as I showing appeal to both genders. However as this is being trounced on grounds of historical inaccuracy I ask did you honestly go to see a film where trailers clearly show nine feet tall physically deformed naked warriors in chains to have its historical facts down to the letter. This film was based on a fictional piece written about a non fictional battle and was never intended to truly portray the actual happenings of the Battle Of Thermopylae. It was intended to entertain, not to educate. As for a political undertone, it may well but at the same time this film could have easily portrayed the Persians in an excellent light as was truly the case and the 300 Spartans each as war hungry monsters who cast defective children from the cliff-tops and in either case its not as though by watching this film you are inciting a war by doing so. Your spending your hours wage to watch two hours of an excellent movie.If you haven't had the chance to watch this film yet I would definitely put it on your list of things to do in life.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
This movie ROCKS,"This movie is so great I can't believe my ears. You will enjoy it I promise. I was the only person who saw it at home in my house but if there had been other people with me they would have enjoyed it too. It is so great that even people in hospitals will like it.The letter ""E"" is the most commonly-used letter in the English language (which many other countries have learned how to speak) and this movie is called 300. This title is a quite rubbish because if you think about it it's just a number and doesn't have any actual words in it but if you can look past that you will find this movie is awesome.It is set millions of years ago (which is in the past) in a land called ""Greece"" where a mad racist king rules his little town called Sparta. He goes crazy one morning when a black man arrives in town and starts making trouble. He runs away with 300 of his soldiers and along the way he meets a big team of metal robots and starts a fight with them which goes on for hours. These robots have scary faces and they brought monsters with them too.One thing that is rubbish in this film is that nobody says why the racists want to fight the robots. I think all the people who made this movie forgot to put that bit in, but it's okay because I made up my own story in my head to explain it and you can do that too.",,Anonymous,Action

Are you.... are you kidding me?,"I'm appalled how many people gave this movie a ""10"". Has the entire community completely forgotten all the criteria that makes up a good film? Perhaps after several years of exposure to painfully awful titles movie goers have lost all sense of a reference point as to what defines a good movie. Maybe I need to remind some of you.This isn't MTV, and this isn't a music video. You need far more than pretty visuals and a soundtrack to award a movie a ""10"". You need more than to be simply entertained to award a movie a ""10"". I hope after coming to your senses a lot of you revisit the scores you awarded this movie.Why the movie didn't deserve a ""1"": 1. Aesthetically, this movie was brilliant. Spotless. I can recall very few movies that were put together so well visually. From the fight sequences to the angles chosen, I was impressed with almost every decision that was made.2. It had its moments. There were a handful of choice scenes that actually affected the story in a meaningful way. Namely the opening sequence showing the training of a Spartan.3. It was under 2 hours.Why this movie didn't deserve a ""10"": 1. I don't care if the movie wasn't intended to be historically accurate, the dialogue should stick to a given time period. The dialogue in 300 had no regard for a given time period; sometimes it seemed like we were in the middle ages, sometimes it seemed we were in the present day.2. The plot failed to develop, and was utterly transparent. You could basically guess within 5 minutes of being introduced to a character exactly what his or her role was in the story. There was absolutely no character development. Movies from the bottom 100 of the IMDb have more character development than 300.3. Far too many parts of the movie were overdone. The Oracle sequence was a good example of this. It was basically a tasteless excuse to show some nudity and visual effects.4. The acting was spotty at best. Gerald Butler's performance was good, everyone else needed some better direction.In conclusion, if you don't care at all about story, dialogue, and acting, but have eyes with which to watch the screen, you'll love this movie.If you like war epics, but care little about their veracity, you'll probably enjoy this movie.If you didn't agree with this review, you most likely rated this movie a ""10"". I give it a 6/10 for being fun to watch, aesthetically accomplished, but overall severely flawed.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
HEY Frank! Hey Warner! What is news!,"Upon seeing the previews of this movie, it immediately becomes apparent that apart from the actual names used in it, the entire depiction of this battle is based upon fantasy. Nowhere among the historical data that remains of the time of Xerxes and ancient Persian empires, do we come across any reference that shows those kings and soldiers as monsters with body-piercing, armors, facial features and demonic behavior that seem to have sprung out from the dungeons of hell. The inaccurate and derogatory depiction of ancient Persians that according to all historical data conducted warfare with mastery and dignity, and looked nothing like science-fictional monsters, is a depiction of how movie studios and authors sacrifice historical accuracy for would-be profits.The author Frank Miller and Warner Brothers Studios should understand that distorting historical data is unethical, and so is feeding ignorance to viewers and readers. Fantasy-like characters should not have names that are based on actual historical figures. Xerxes was one of the many revered and respected rulers of an ancient civilization the vestiges of which last to this day and are acknowledged by historians of all nations. He did not look like a creature out of a frightening bedtime story. Neither did his soldiers.",1.0,Anonymous,Action
Perfect,"I love this movie! Watched it yesterday, and I want to see it again! I know a lot about the real battle of Thermopylae, but I don't Care: ""Oh my god, they did not have elephants"" and that many people say that this is racism. Well I think not! Why is it racism? You may answer ""Because it's only black messengers getting killed"" That is stupid, if you went to war, wouldn't you use slaves instead of your own people to do the work? I have read that several Iranians said that the Persians did not have Slaves, well think again because Persia had a lot of slaves from their Conquered provinces. But that doesn't make them evil, even Sparta had Slaves called Helots... The movie, and the event is important, because if the Greeks hadn't won The war our society would have been very different. But i must credit the Persians because they are said to be ""The real Brains in antiquity"". That is somewhat correct because they invented a Lot of stuff. Many famous poets and philosophers too.Script 10/10 perfect Sound & Music 10/10 Love the music!!!!!

300... a DELIGHT To The EYE,"I mean WHAT a film. The cinematography for one is stone dead perfect. The lighting effects and general direction is bang on and makes the film a non-stop adrenaline filled film.Another thing I liked is the film never tried to make any one Spartan look like a hero. Yes we had King Leionidas but for every shot of him throwing a spear through the eyes of Persian, we saw a parallel shot of say Captain or Dilios cutting a mans face down the centre to which a pool of blood erupted. In life the Spartans were always about the man by your side and this film pulled that point across to absolute perfection.I also liked the banter between Stelios and Captains son. It lightened the mood of the movie and reminded me of the banter between Gimli and Legolas in LotR. Whats more their friendly banter made the death of Captains Son for myself that little harder to watch.The action and fights were awesome, with blood, decapitations, merciless warriors truly lighting the screen up. I loved how the directors made Xerxes so much taller, as if to make us think Xerxes was that little bit mightier which made the eventual downfall of so many Persians all the more sweeter to watch.The constant narration by Dilios was again perfect, he came in and spoke when needed and the writing was sublime.I want to give it a 10 but that 0.0000000001 is because I wanted the movie to go on for hour's on end. They could have made this movie 5, 10, 24 hours long and not one person would want to leave that cinema before the movie finished.and whats with the fat dude with two blades for hands.

Rocking Frank Miller-Adaption,"The new Snyder-Movie is an astonishing piece of modern cine-art. There are so many perspectives, fast camera moves and a quite extraordinary montage-technique, which give the movie such an exceptional appearance! The movie is a comic-adaption from Frank Miller and visualizes this issue perfectly! As well as the last Frank Miller-Adaption ""Sin City"" ""300"" convinces with its special visual effects, which highlight the specific character of a comic. Thus it is quite irrelevant, if it sometimes does not stick to the historical background. This issue was criticized by the press at the first preview at the Berlinale.

CGI Battle Scenes Star--But No Shivers for the Story or Characters,"Because of the breakthroughs in CGI, there has been a surge of epic films set in the ancient world such as Troy, Gladiator, and Kingdom of Heaven. This trend is very similar to the time when Cinemascope made its debut in the 1950's with movies also set in the ancient world such as The Egyptian, Spartacus, Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments. Now ""300"", based on comic book legend Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name, has entered the list of action movies set in ancient times, and the very short list of feature films that exclusively uses CGI. If amazing battle scenes with blood-running spectacle is what you enjoy, 300 is for you. In many ways, 300 puts you in the middle of every battle, a bit like computer and video games put the user the into the middle of the action of a situation. At times, the movie felt like a computer game in a movie theater. The CGI battle scenes are the star of the show, and worth the price of admission if no-holds-barred sword-fighting is what allows the warrior within to feel some momentary gratification.However, complex thematic story-telling is not what this movie is about. The characters are more caricatured icons than real people. Leonidas as the King of the Spartans is the warrior-king who is, well, a warrior-king, nothing more, nothing less. He acts as the devoted savior of his people with the selfless agenda of a demigod. The kind of person you wish would run for president of the United States, but can't because no such person exists. His wife is equally as iconic, feminine but strong-willed to defend her husband's resolve. Have people like this ever existed? And when these icons are not spearing their enemies, they are making speeches about how great it is to spear their enemies.A couple of moments had potential for interesting story development. Two supporting characters, a hunchback who is refused by Leonidas, and Theron, a member of the Spartan council who is not as grateful for Leonidas' battle campaign, divert the story a little from its predictable track. Unfortunately, these characters' stories, their motives, and their destinies have little development, and it was frustrating that more unpredictable situations did not occur. As much as I did enjoy the spectacle, I found I didn't much care about the characters. It's not that they were as blood-thirsty as their enemies, but there was little to about them that made me feel that these characters had enough flaws to feel like they were real people.The portrayal of Xerxes was over the top, even for a baddie. He is not just arrogant and hedonistic. He is also a sloth, watching as his people die for his vanity. And when he sustains a superficial flesh wound, he reacts like the teacher's pet that got punched in the nose for his insults. Did the Persians real pick this guy as their leader? (Even Darth Vader had proved himself as a warrior.) The portrayal of the Persian warriors are also caricatured as unskilled amateurs. The Persian troops have about the same fighting skill as your average first-round combatants in a video or computer game. They die at the first swipe. Each Spartan cuts down about 50-60 Persian combatants per battle! And when they are not getting their clocks cleaned by the Spartans, the Persians are engaging in hedonistic sex with deranged and deformed concubines. (I can understand why people of Persian ancestry have become offended by this movie.)I compare this film to Excalibur. Both have iconic characters with bigger-than-life themes based on mythic stories. Both are set in ancient times with an emphasis on battle and warriors where the good guys and the bad guys are clearly defined. But Excalibur had more heart and more mystery. We know Arthur is doomed in Excalibur as everyone knows the story of Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table. However, the way in which the tragedy unfolds and how the characters deal with their destiny is what makes the journey worth taking. Even Arthur has moments of vanity when he first meets and battles Sir Lancelot. Mordred is evil but he cunning and intelligent, not just vane and slothful. And its hard to beat the portrayal of Merlin. In 300, I never felt that I was close enough to the characters to find I felt or for that matter understood what the characters were up against. And with each successive wave of battles, I found it a bit less compelling than it should have been.When the last remaining warriors of the Knights of the Round Table go to fight their last battle against Mordred, even though I know what's coming, I always get shivers up my spine, even after 25 years. The knights riding through the lush countryside making their last tragic stand, knowing the outcome will not be in their favor, with their pennants that represent their code of honor flowing behind them in the wind, is what knighthood is all about. When the Spartans made their last stand, I was intrigued, but not moved. No shivers.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
"300 (Zack Snyder, 2006) ***","I wasn't really expecting to enjoy this epic/comic-strip adaptation but I was quite pleasantly surprised and even impressed by it (watching it on the big screen decidedly helped); while clearly superior to the more straightforward telling of the legendary battle in the Hollywood spectacular THE 300 SPARTANS (1962), it's also certainly the closest approximation to a graphic novel that cinema has come up with so far (the desaturated color scheme really puts one in the ambiance). The unexpectedly full-blooded acting (especially lead Gerard Butler) also managed to breathe life into stock characters often forced to mouth propagandist slogans (though the Spartans' battle cry, making them sound more like an American football team, is corny)! The battle sequences are among the fiercest ever depicted, even if the gimmicky editing distracts from their ultimate impact. Where the film tends to falter is in the unnecessary grotesquerie on display ¬ñ the lecherous Spartan leper priests, the conniving hunchback, the campily made-up Persian king and his ogre warriors, etc.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
please,"Went to the see the movie and thought it was great. Not 10/10 maybe 9/10 To those out there ranting it wasn't historically accurate please.... the movie was based on a comic...... if you want to blame someone for historical rape then blame Frank Miller. History is usually recorded and altered by the dominant powers of the time so you never get a true accurate record of what really happened Go see the movie for what it is.... entertainment. Never in the movie will you see ""based on true events"" ,it has 50ft tall elephants in it!!! All in all it was beautifully shot and mixed live action with CGI The only gripe i had was that there wasn't enough depth to the Spartans Only four characters were highlighted out of 300.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Worth watching but poor acting and directing foil what could have been a classic war movie,"Clearly, this film is not for everyone. The film looks utterly fantastic, but the reality is, this is a failed attempt at a breakthrough film. The battle scenes are magnificent; in fact I can't remember seeing a more interesting film about ancient war. Now before the fan boys pile on, ask yourself honestly about the poor acting, horrible directing and quite possibility the worst voice over ever heard in a movie and why it really put a damper on the party for some. I know people will disagree and say that it was supposed to be over the top and that is fine, but I think even less dialogue would have improved this film. Everything was drilled home in 50 point block letters and subtlety was completely abandoned. People in the Imax I saw this film with were eating up the endless catchphrases. Well, that's showbiz... I guess.As a comic book movie, this was mission accomplished. Great villains, amazing action sequences that stylistically were like a dance and really, really bloody battles make this an action film for fans of the genre. And these elements reach right in and pull this movie out of the fire. And while I was not bothered by the no-name cast, the direction of these actors was bordering on criminal behavior. The over use of slow motion and not mixing up the technique really marred the overall product that was provided to the viewer. It really started to seem like a music video. Don't get me wrong, there were some amazing movie moments in this film, but the eye rolling at the ham fisted words really detracted from the movie as an overall piece of art it could have been. If Zack Snyder is really going to direct Alan Moore's the Watchmen, he needs to go and look up the words subtle and substance before he utters ""action"" even the first time during filming.Much has been said about if Synder was trying to slip a conservative message into the film and a lot of things could be read or misread from this. Believe me, he wasn't that smooth. In my opinion it was a not so subtle way of portraying the hawk-like nature of the Spartan culture is ultimately what was being conveyed and not a slipped jab to eastern Asian culture as some have implied. But take what you will from the ""they ask you to stand and I ask you kneel"" remarks of Xerxes. That is the rhetoric of rulers and warriors and it's not always pretty. A lot of items in this film can have modern day parallels drawn. But ultimately it is just a movie. Relax. Followers of Islam should relax, Islam didn't even exist during this time.I guess for me personally, the worst part about this film is how much potential was wasted. This is an amazing legend that could have really been translated into something we would remember for a long time, had some actor directing skill and improved dialogue, this could have been a masterpiece. I love and hate this film at the same time.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
A movie about bad asses. That'really about it. I get that many are digging for this film.,"Alright, I watched '300' with a high medium expectation. This was not a great movie for sure. I don't know in which part other people are finding to praise about.To begin with, I have a problem with a script. As many might know, the story is loosely based on a historical event that 300 Spartan soldiers fought against Persian armies till death. Sounds like an interesting story but I felt quite bored with the story telling in this film. There is no twist, no suspense, no tension between characters. This film has one and only goal which is to show audiences how Spartans fought their asses off against seemingly endless Persians.Alright so I think the story sucks. Obviously, this is supposed to be an action movie. Then, does this film provide spectacular fighting scenes? Yeah, sort of but it's not that impressive. Haven't we seen all these in 'Gladiator' and 'Lord of the rings I II III'? I really got bored after watching some blood and every part of body flying around. Oh boy, I haven't seen that much blood in a film. If you are a gore movie fan, you might like this movie. ;)Although there was not much room for acting in this full of fighting movie, the convincing performance of Spartan king was probably the only thing that I liked about this film.I can see so much potential for this story to be successful but the director failed to put all the necessary ingredients together.I can understand that a lot of guys will be sucking for '300' because this is quite a macho story. But please don't use big words like 'groundbreaking' or 'breathtaking' for this mediocre film. I mean. Seriously. If you like it, just say why you like it. Don't talk like you know something.It's painful for me to see this film in TOP 250.",1.0,Anonymous,Action

A brilliant adaptation of Frank Miller's comic books,"The austere design and sepia cinematography of this movie is beautiful. It is a brilliant adaptation of Frank Miller's comics, staying true to the visual and literary simplicity of the comic form.The dialogues are clich√©s and chauvinistic, at times riddled with contradictions and rampant war propaganda. But suffice it to say one should watch the movie for its sheer entertainment value, as this movie is based on a fictitious comic book. Frank Miller loves gore, stylised violence and awkward sensibility, and all of these elements are well conveyed in the movie version of '300'.300 is a pure adrenaline rush of awesome visual and hyperkinetic violence. A respectful and remarkable tribute to Frank Miller.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
300 = Awesome,"This movie is awesome action movie. I did not want to see this movie, my sister wanted to so I went with her. I expected to take a nap during the film. Boy, was I wrong. The action scenes are awesome, the acting is really good, and the dialogue is spot on for this movie. IT IS NOT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE and it's not supposed to be. I also love all the buff guys with hot UK accents. Gerard Butler hits his part out of the park. The Spartans are ancient Greek Klingons, and are totally bad ass. I don't understand all of the controversy surrounding this film. Persian are going to be darker than Greeks so they are portrayed as darker than Greeks. I also really liked the fact they had a strong woman (not 21 year old) but a woman. Queen Gorgo was played with intelligence, loyalty and passion. She is not a part of the set like most other woman portrayed during this time period. She is the Princess Leia of the movie. I hope more producers and studio heads look to this. It is visually stunning and 100 times better than TROY.",,Anonymous,Action

Well crafted,"You shouldn't go to this movie expecting a great historical telling of the Battle of Thermopylae, and I think most who make it to the theatre pretty much know what they are in for. And that is simply a stunning recreation of Frank Millers graphic, testosterone fueled vision of what it might have been like to be a Spartan at the time, facing those insurmountable odds yet willing to lay it all out for your family, your nation, your world.I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I knew it would be entertaining, action packed, and full of great visuals much like Miller's stunning Sin City. What I wasn't prepared for was the solid acting. Characters were real and dimensional, and well played by all.We spent the extra few dollars and caught the IMAX version, which was well worth it. Surprised to see almost as many women at the showing as men, and judging by the comments as the credits rolled, this movie will appeal to the ladies as much as the guys. The strong portrayal of Queen Gorgo, by Lena Headey, is one of the reasons. And I'm sure the leather loin clothes on the guys, and all the bare pectoral real estate, might be another.The violence is brutal, yet fantastical in typical comic book fashion. I found movies like Braveheart, or The Departed, to be much gorier. 300 is not a family movie by any stretch, yet it is neither a blood soaked slash and gash picture. It is more jagged and raw, within that logical, rigid Spartan ideal, which fits in perfectly with the visual and thematic tones director Zack Snyder went for with this picture.I would watch this movie again, and probably enjoy it just as much.Guys, don't be afraid to take the ladies to this one. Trade her for a chick flick and you'll both be glad you did.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"Wow, I gotta start working out...","I remember I almost fell out of my chair when I first saw the preview for 300, although it's taken me over a year since I bought the DVD to get around to watching it. Maybe because the bad reviews started trickling in. It's an adaptation of a graphic novel that I haven't read, but I'm told that that novel portrays a sort of heightened reality like what Leonidas describes as he is faced with seemingly insurmountable danger. The movie retains that level of hyper- reality and achieves a truly unique look and experience, but it may put off viewers interested in seeing something about the real story that the film is based on.Of course, the true story of a hugely inferior band of Spartans holding out against the Persian army is so clouded in myth and legend that by now it's impossible to say for sure what really happened, but we can probably assume that a good majority of what happens in this movie didn't happen.My knowledge of ancient Greek history is pretty limited, to say the least, but I was sort of expecting that the movie would tell something about what happened at the Battle of Thermopylae, where the courageous Spartans took their stand. Instead, it's sort of a bloated comic-book movie the sometimes doesn't seem to know whether it wants to emulate Troy, Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter. There's a hunchback, there's magic, there are fully grown mountain dwarfs, a healthy dose of Hollywood/comic book machismo, and lots of spraying blood that reminded me of Tarantino's spectacularly disappointing Sin City. At least here it's not green.In the movie's defense, it is definitely an astonishing visual achievement. It's true that the entire film is digital and you are never able to forget that, but it is definitely beautiful. The problem with digital backgrounds is that, apparently, they still haven't been able to make them look really realistic, especially battle scenes. I'm pretty sure they're making video games these days that look this good.Half of the reason I wanted to see the movie was because of the tough talk in defiance of so- called authority, I always love that. Have you seen those ""Caution: This is Sparta"" signs? HILARIOUS. Anyway, there are a lot of classic moments and memorable lines in the movie (""There's no reason we can't be civil, is there?""), but after a while I found the over-the-top bravado a little cloying and just a little too, ah, over-the-top. There is no sense of realism, but then again the movie never tries for it. It is, basically, a romanticized and dramatized telling of a historical battle, just like what Braveheart is. But this movie is romanticized and dramatized in completely different ways. Ultimately, I think the result is better off intended for a slightly younger audience.The performances in the film are wonderful, sometimes even astonishing. Gerard Butler as Leonidas is one of the most intense performances I've seen in a movie in some years, reminding me for some reason of the unbelievable level of intensity that Tom Cruise brought to Mission Impossible III. I noticed some IMDb user make the bizarre claim that Xerxes, played by Rodrigo Santoro, looked gay. Yes, Xerxes is quite a spectacle to behold, but effeminate? PLEASE. The only thing remotely effeminate about him were his eyebrows, but other than that he had the otherworldly presence that a living god should have. And besides, I have to say that I wonder about anyone who could hear his voice and think androgyny!300 was a slight disappointment to me, but it definitely succeeds in what it sets out to do. It's a wild ride from start to finish and it never lets up, but I can't deny that there are some definite cheese moments, even for a film like this. It promises basically 100 minutes of exactly what you see in that almost weirdly impressive theatrical trailer, and if you can handle that for a couple hours, you're in for a treat.Terrible date movie, though...",7.0,Anonymous,Action
I can not be swayed....,"Running a video store, I see a lot of movies.Being a total nerd, and lacking a social life, I pride myself on my knowledge of movies, actors, and general things of the like.I have my favorite movies, and movies that I think are ""The best movie ever."" Well, since I have a lot of time to sit and think about stuff, and since one of my far off dreams is to be a movie critic, I had come to the conclusion that...even though these are my ""favorite"" movies, and the ""best"" movies ever made...all of them have some sort of flaw. There are plot holes, there is filler where it's not needed, movies drag on, and sometimes acting lacks.This is normal, it's going to happen...in every movie. At least that's how I felt until roughly 2:15a.m.(Prepare for corny movie ass kissing) I went to see the midnight showing of 300. I could almost end it at that and leaving you guessing as to if the movie contradicts my prior reservations on all movies, even the best of my favorites.Basically, I went into it having only seen previews, obviously. EVERYONE wants to see this movie based on the previews...in showing how the movie was shot as far as lens filters, and the fact that Frank Miller wrote the graphic novel and directed. Frank Miller also did Sin City, and so people know it's going to be awesome just from that. Although, even though Sin City is one of the coolest movies ever....it follows the guidelines of: Plot holes, Bad Acting, and a general lack of what it needed to actually be a GREAT movie.Basically, everyone expects that 300 is going to be awesome. Oooh, random chaotic violence and a lot of unheeded gore and bloodshed. That was my assumption at least. And, strange enough, I like movies like that. I'm not a typical girl in that sense.Getting the point and steering away from droning: In going over it in my head, over and over, pretty much all night (consider my lack of a social life), I can not think of a single thing I did not like about this movie.The story was there, the plot was full. Those are the key things.It didn't take it's time to get to the point of the movie by adding agonizing explanation. It explained enough to where you understand what's going on, and what's going to happen. It got to the exciting part of the movie very quickly, and stayed exciting throughout. Oh, and it was definitely the most violent and gruesome movie to ever be put out for public viewing.Acting? Yeah, there was the presumption that there would be bad actors. There was one: Rodrigo Santora played self assumed God Xerxes...and his acting was MISERABLE...and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. His acting was made to be OBVIOUSLY terrible...and it fits for the character...Xerxes. He was a man, a mortal who decided himself to be a God of men and therefore immortal. He's meant not to be taken seriously, and therein made to do a bad ""acting"" job for the movie...and therefore the acting was AMAZING on all ends.The cinematography is just completely unbelievable. You think you can tell from the previews? No way dude. It will blow your mind. This movie could have sucked on all ends but still been tolerable to watch based on the way it was filmed alone. (much like Sin City) And finally...one thing that I can't stand, and it's really not because I'm a girl...it's not, is when there's a lot of random pointless nudity in a movie that is basically only there to draw guys in to see the movie. This movie had it's fair share of nudity, but all of it in good taste and not enough to base the movie's appeal around it. As a matter of fact, I would find this movie more UNappealing for a guy because of how much male exposure there is. No, not full frontal, but my god...if every single one of the 300 did not have a full and solid ripped 8-10 pack. Again, I'm not a typical girl in most senses, but had the movie been terrible...I could have tolerated it based on that alone.Ending this rant: 300 has most assuredly become the best movie I have ever seen. No, you can not sway me on that. It was perfect. Every aspect. No plot holes, no filler, no real bad acting, and it was appealing to all senses. You leave the movie feeling more powerful...standing an inch or two taller...and it will provide good conversation for a long time to come. Go see it. Go see it twice, it deserves your hard earned dollar.As for me, the Imax is my next destination to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

"""300"" insulting on so many levels","300 was the first movie of 2007 for me. 2007 was/is going to be the year of quality over quantity. I'm tired of running out to see seemingly good movies based upon good trailers, just to find out that the movie was not worth the money spent. I was going to wait until this summer before going to the theater, but Saturday night rolled around and I had nothing to do, so against my better judgment, I went to see 300.I looked up the start time online to find out that ""300"" started at 10:05. I went to the theater and saw ""300"" on the marquee. I purchased a ticket for ""300"", and it read clearly on the ticket, ""300"". I went to the screen which also had a marquee that read, ""300"". I sat down through 30 minutes of commercials and previews before the movie started, and the title read, ""300"". So, I'm sure I did watch the movie ""300"", but by the end of the movie all I was sure of is that I got ripped off.As highly touted as this movie was, as much money as it raked in, this movie was a bomb. I felt like I sat through two hours of Greek propaganda. I wanted to see the movie because I figured it would be similar to ""Troy"", ""Lord of the Rings"", or ""Kingdom of Heaven"" with the fighting. In other words, two very good and well equipped armies battling it out until one is overcome by the other. Umm, how wrong I was. It was more like a bad martial arts film with spears and swords. You know the kung fu movie where the hero is surrounded by his dozens of opponents, and they all attack one at a time, until the hero kicks or punches them all out without much effort. You know that type of movie? Yeah, well ""300"" was like that.I don't think I've ever seen a more inept army, or were we to believe that the Spartan band was just that good? The Spartans were not just heros, they were superheros. With little more than a cape and a pair of leather Speedos, they were able to fend off the biggest army they ever faced. I don't even think they wore a cup. They didn't have one wasted motion. Every strike was fatal, every block was well timed, and they never suffered one loss until late into the movie. When I say they didn't suffer one loss, I mean not a loss of blood, not a loss of sweat, not a loss of nerves, not a loss of a weapon. As many spears that were chucked, they somehow regenerated them. Heck, they didn't even lose breath in this movie. Even if the Persian army was the biggest waste of flesh to hold a sword, the shear numbers would have caused exhaustion in any humans, but the Spartans fought droves of Persians without getting tired. Battle after battle, the Spartans came out with glossier skin than the fight before. To have so much exposed skin, I would think that they may suffer an abrasion or two on the rocks... they didn't even get that.Eventually you come to realize that the Persian army consisted of the armies of every conquered nation in the known world with the exception of Sparta, in other words Greece, or in other words Europe. Amongst the Persian army you saw Black faces, Asian faces, Indian faces, Persian faces, and even monsters from origins unknown. Sparta was the first nation of Europe to be attacked, and Sparta/Europe was the only nation to withstand the onslaught of Persia. The Persian army, with the skills, talent, strength, and minds of so many other nations-- fought so pathetically, that they may as well not have been wielding swords. The Spartans were so graceful, skilled, strong, and every other admirable characteristic you can think of, that you got the idea that they could have done just as well with a rubberband and paper clips. Translation: white = strength, honor, grace, etc.; non-white = weak, stupid, shameful, etc. I can see why the Iranians were upset with this movie.""300"" was a gross exaggeration of a real event. The battle in ""Lord of the Rings"" was much more realistic. At least there was some give in ""Lord of the Rings"", there were some losses, and there were even some signs of peril. ""300"" leads you to believe that a bunch of 3/4 naked Ambercrombie & Fitch models with capes on were able to take on untold thousands of Persian soldiers to protect their beloved Sparta. Yeah, that's even less believable than the U.S. having won the Vietnam War.If you are looking for blood, violence, sex, and nudity, then this movie is perfect for you. If you are looking for content, depth, or even just historical accuracy, then stay far away from this movie. This movie was empty, it didn't provoke the mind or the heart. The characters are all one dimensional and it looks like the entire movie was done in front of a blue screen. This movie is not only an insult to one's intelligence, it is an insult to all non-whites.",1.0,Anonymous,Action
"Intense, Passionate, Magnificent","I saw 300 last night. What an absolutely awesome movie. Overall, it was incredible. The movie is based on Frank Miller's graphic novel about the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C.Historical accuracies are scattered throughout the movie. From the moment we see them examining the child king and determining if he meets their standards or he would be thrown over a cliff onto a mound of lost souls to the training and fighting style of the Spartan soldier.Zack Snyder directed the movie and he must have been divinely inspired. The movie is that magnificent. The use of narration to tell the story, along with the actual scenes made the realism more clear. You truly believe this was how the battle developed and how King Leonidas ruled.Speaking of King Leonidas, the casting for this character was perfect. Gerald Butler was King Leonidas. Right down to the most minute detail. From the braid that hung from the back of his head, to his stoic glare, to his commanding presence among his men. I do not believe any other man could have done a better job.All of the casting seemed to fit the characters very well. Each actor melded with their character and made us believe they were Spartans, Persians, and man made gods.While the movie does portray a brutal battle, I don't believe there was any gratuitous violence. The images of men fighting with all their heart, body, and soul to protect what they truly believe in - Sparta - transcends the actual acts of intense violence. The images may linger, but so will the depth of passion they invoked.The Spartans weren't without their sense of humor. The occasional remark made by King Leonidas only made him more human. I found his method of negotiation amusing and just.I love a good movie soundtrack, and 300 didn't disappoint. The scenes and music together pulled you into the moment, suspending your belief, engulfing your senses, making you forget for a while that you're sitting in a movie theater with dozens of other people.Give yourself a treat. Go see 300. Hurry before it finishes its run in the theater. It's a must for the big screen. Lose yourself in Greek history.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Leonidas for President!,"""300"" is a fast, fun, exhilarating, inspirational movie. It's sexy and sick, graphically violent, and a feast of heavily weighted political and religious symbols.Gerard Butler is stunning to look at -- his body is bulked up and sculpted, and he is completely believable as an ancient Spartan king who happens to have a Scottish accent. In turns Butler looks determined -- when in battle -- loving -- toward his wife -- and amused -- when confronting Xerxes of the excessively tweezed eyebrows.Yes, the movie is violent -- its name, ""300,"" is made to look as if written in splattering blood, after all. But the bad guys are really, really bad, the good guys are preeeetty good, and the fate of Western Civilization hangs in the balance, so the violence is meant to be in service to a larger, worthy cause.""300""'s actors performed before green screens, not on three-dimensional sets. The sets were added by computer. Some say that this process results in a fake-looking movie that doesn't engage the emotions. My emotions were so engaged I cried twice.I had fun at this movie. So much fun I wish I could give it a ten. Instead, I'm tempting to give it a seven.For all it has going for it, the movie never rises above its comic book roots.Women? The movie makes a couple of flamboyant gestures toward women: Queen Gorgo gets to say ""Only Spartan women give birth to real men,"" but the movie, in two scenes, panders to the worst in the worst male imagination. There are two scenes where women are violated on camera. It's made clear that there are little boys in Sparta, as well as men, but the movie doesn't say enough about how Spartan women got to be the truly exceptional women they were.Plutarch reported that the men of Sparta always obeyed their wives. Spartan women married later than other women, in order to ensure healthy births. They could own property, wore clothing that allowed them freedom of movement, and could have more than one husband.Why, then, does ""300,"" while depicting Spartan men heroically, depict a Spartan girl not so much as swatting away an ephor who abuses her, never mind the ugly fate the film hands its best female character? The movie's dismissal of women is just part of how it refuses to be a full film, rather than just a comic book. That's why it's not a ten.And then there is the political subtext.Look, you'd have to be Rip van Winkle not to get the political subtext here, intended or not.The Greek wars against Persians have long been depicted as an essential battle between Western freedom, democracy, and reason and Eastern tyranny, despotism, slavery, submission, and obscurantism. Leonidas and Xerxes faced off long before the birth of Christ, Mohammed, or Osama bin Laden, but they were laying down the foundation of epochal narratives, narratives we still use to define our lives.Again, whether intended or not, various features of ""300"" will be read as part of this millenia-old battle between West and East. Examples: Xerxes and his minions are festooned with chains. The chains echo slavery, the presumed condition against which the Greeks were fighting, and which they repeatedly name as their enemy. Slavery is associated with submission, and submission is the English word for ""Islam."" Xerxes' troops wear turbans and face veils that are similar to costumes donned by the Taliban today.Persia is the ancient word for what is today Iran.Xerxes entertains himself with belly dancers, associated with Muslim countries.The ephors are made out to be Politically Correct traitors and equivocators, sort of like creepy old college profs.Etc.You may not read the film that way, Frank Miller and/or Zack Snyder may not have intended any of the film's imagery that way, but that's how many viewers will read it.Whatever.""300"" is beautiful to look at, and it's a good time.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Great movie and exactly what it claims to be,"I do not think this is a spoiler but, shock of shocks, this movie is not intended to educate viewers as to the reality of Ancient Greece, Persia, the real Xerxes, real Spartans, real battle outfits and tactics or darn near anything else. The list of historical inaccuracies are legion (to coin the phrase) but the big point that critics and others seem to miss is that this movie is not intended to be a historical documentary. If you wish to see this movie for its historical value and commentary, you should really reconsider your approach to movies. Seriously.What this movie is a movie adaption of a comic book (aka graphic novel). That is what it wants to be and, as far as I am concerned, what it achieves in spades. I felt like I was reading a comic book. There was minimal character development and background because you do not need such. This is the Queen. She is married to the King. Nuff Said. No need for an exposition on her upbringing or heritage or motivations or anything else. She is the Queen, now on with the story.I have read reviews where people try to equate parts of this movie with the Irag situation or with many other modern day events but, again, they are missing the point. This is not a movie intended to an allegory for modern time or to comment on society. It is a COMIC BOOK movie. It is meant for the toughest purpose of all (in my opinion), to entertain. To make you relax, thrill and enjoy the story, scenes and images for a time. To throw other thoughts away and, for a time, become part of the fictional Sparta facing a fictional Horde. No lessons, no deep morals, just relax and enjoy the ride.When you do that, you will love this movie. There are tons of inaccuracies and tons of politically incorrect ideas in the movie but why are you looking for such in a COMIC BOOK movie? My 15 year old son loved it and says it is his favorite movie. Maybe partly because of the semi-naked women (who are not important to the movie but will surely draw more teen boys) but because it was simple and fun. You want history and knowledge, avoid this movie. You want to relax, enjoy a good story and just have fun, do not miss this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"A highly stylised, very violent epic ...","I saw this in the cinema on Tuesday, as you guessed, cause of hype. You couldn't turn a corner without seeing the poster on some bus passing by, and with the trailers being shown nearly every ad break on the telly together with the fact that there was nothing else showing that interested me, I decided to buy a ticket and I didn't regret it.King Leonidas is born to fight, and feels it's his destiny to lead 300 Spartans to battle with the Persians - cue the gruesome bloody fights as the 300 men fight for their country, regardless of being so small in number when compared to their enemies.The extensive use of CG(which is amazingly done, like the sequences with arrows shooting through the air) and slow-mo shots ads to the comic-book and stylised feel of the film, seeing as it's based on a graphic novel I've not read but who also wrote Sin City which I also saw nearly 2 years ago and enjoyed.There are some shocks along the way as certain characters do the unexpected things. You really get into it when watching, fully behind the King's army, hoping for victory. Gerard Way gives a great performance as the main character Leonidas, and the supporting actors also hold their own.OK, it does look like an 18-rated high-end violent next generation video game, and may seem like a very masculine film, with the war cries and very toned soldiers, but this film has a deeper message than any superficial stuff - it's quite inspiring in a way, to think that these men, against all odds risked their lives for freedom.Overall, it does contain some funny lines that are shouted by it's main character(""Tonight, we dine in hell!"") but this is good, being a visual feast and not completely daft.",,Anonymous,Action
A truly visual masterpiece that disrupts the epic genre,"Zack Snyder is becoming one of the most interesting American directors for the originality and aesthetic nature of his work.Here, the author of the remake 'Dawn of the Dead', presents us a beautiful graphic spectacle, a truly visual masterpiece that narrates the story of Spartan king Leonidas facing Xerxes, the Persian emperor, and his vast army.Applauses to the emergence of a different and very developed style, loyal to Frank Miller's comic book, with memorable scenes of combat and a ferocious Gerard Butler, in a instant cult phenomenon action movie that disrupts the epic genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Amazing,"How can I put this simply? Oh, I know. The best movie ever.300 does not have a dull moment the entire film. Just when you think it couldn't get better, it steps its game up more.Lots of historical movies are hard to follow, require a full history lesson before you watch it and drags out their battle scenes, which of course have already lost you in the confusion of it all. 300 does none of any of that. I could fully understand what was going on and I never once took my eyes off the fighting.It's safe to say that I can watch this movie three hundred times and still think it's just as awesome as the first time I watched it. Everything about it was great. It didn't have too much or too little of anything.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Had everything but lacked soul..,"I was dying to see this movie from the time I heard of it especially since I'm a big fan of the R-rated gory battle movies and loved Sincity.The fact that there are no names in this movie hardly seemed important and wasn't in the end.The premise of this movie had limitless potential for the stylised bloodshed and swordplay that I love so much, the real battle was much less one sided (a thousand at a height against 1,00,000) but I was happy to learn that the movies would be taking liberties with history in order to make a more entertaining film.And entertaining it was.........It excelled in almost every field the visuals were brilliant (albeit very heavy on CG and the digital effects could be jarring for some) and every scene felt like a painting, the film had a similar comic book feel that Sincity had and similar film effects had a lot to do with it.The action scenes were brilliant albeit historically inaccurate, they were as brutal and gory as can be and I loved it. The action was well choreographed and it was great fun seeing a bunch of super warriors annihilate all sorts of stuff that was thrown at them. (Being Indian I found it hard to believe how the Greeks tackled elephants when ironically 300 elephants of Poruses army wiped out most of Alexanders if it wasn't for the storm that drove the elephants mad Alexander would have lost his entire army of 75000).The acting was good with the movie always remaining true to its comic book heritage with lots of short simple and effective dialogues peppered across the film and THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ANY COMIC THE NARRATOR.The story was interesting and as with almost all history the stories that are remembered the most and the longest are the ones involving some tragedy or mishap (obviously the ultimate victor writes history but again the events that are remembered are the tragedies for either of the sides). People love the underdog here too a handful of great warriors taking on a massive army endears to the heart.The background score was decent and added to the movie.Technically the movie was near perfect with excellent direction and digital cinematography the way the comic book feel is created is brilliant.The short length of the movie ensured that you never lost interest for even a moment and enjoyed throughout the film.So why the low rating?!! Like I said the movie lacked a soul...The comic book dialogues were perfect for Sincity which was always about the comic but this movie involves an intense epic battle and the absolute lack of any stirring dialogue does more good than bad, scenes involving patriotism were absolutely lost, THOSE THAT ARE LESS EMOTIONAL ABOUT BATTLE MOVIES AND PATRIOTISM WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS AS MUCH AS ME THOUGH.I loved the sheer amount of bloodshed but the lack of spirit that I was talking about surfaces here too though with the sheer number of deaths taking precedence over the intense personal fights between two great warriors that are shown in most movies involving epic battles.Im a person who fantasizes about dying for my country and gets easily stirred by battle and very emotional in those involving patriotism and the underdog,(i seriously believe that I may have been a warrior and freedon fighter in my past life) even then this movie failed to strike a chord in me (I'm one who gets emotional even in movies like Troy or Arthur which was supposed to be less intense than say a Braveheart).Maybe I set my expectations to high or wanted something from this movie that it was never supposed to have but a movie that seems tailor-made for me yet failed to stir me seems like a serious issue (save for patriotism and victory of the underdog I like my movie as simple as possible I like my fights gory, lots of murder (zombie flicks), my comedy crass and the women nude). So even though it was impossible for me not to like this movie it seriously fell below my expectations.The common critic always favour movies that have drama and going by the hype surrounding it I seriously felt this movie would have loads of spirit.The ending too was lack-lustre and could have been done much better especially considering the preceding comic book like story and action.In either case this movie is a much watch movie with just about enough to please the festival crowd and those who use the word cinema instead of movies.-s absolute lack of soul,lacklustre ending, fell below expectations.+/-s comic book feel (loved it Sincity though).+s superb technically, good acting, great action scenes with lots of blood and gore, hot chicks,short and sweet,very interesting story, suitable for all audiences.total 7/10 (ignoring the fact that it fell way below expectations lacklustre ending will be an issue even for people with different tastes and is a major factor in the lower rating).",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Beautiful, Gory just lacking in soul","I am a big fan of the epic genre, when Ridley Scott gave life back into a long believed dead genre with Gladiator all those years ago I was very excited. Due to the financial and Oscar success loads more of those flicks were made. We had Troy, Kingdom of Heaven and Alexander. However out of those three only one of which I found any good, that surprisingly is the critically mauled Troy. Kingdom of Heaven and Alexander were overlong dull pieces of work that took themselves way too seriously. Now you see the faults I listed there, they've basically took those faults, corrected them, added loads more gore and loads more cheesy dialogue and that is pretty much what 300 is. Now that makes it out to be a bad movie, but 300 really isn't a bad movie. You see, what it lacks in heart and soul it more than makes up for in sheer bloodlust and sheer coolness. This is a movie that never even comes close to taking itself seriously, in fact when limbs and heads aren't being cut off you usually find this movie has a good sense of humour. My personal favourite scene involves King Leonidas calmly eating an apple during the battle. Its a small moment but its also a fairly funny moment as well. However, this is not to say that 300 is without its faults. With a clear focus on entertainment rather than being a good movie the faults become very clear. Matters aren't helped either by the fact that the beginning, while looking gorgeous verges on boring.Lets talk about the action then, as that's what 300 is truly about and when the action does eventually kick in 300 becomes one of the best movies in a long while. Most epic movies fights look beautiful, but none of their beauty comes close to the beauty of this movie. While all the backgrounds and a lot of other things are special effects that doesn't prevent them from looking both startlingly real and being beautiful. Its clearly taken ideas from Sin City (apart from the story which was also done by Frank Miller), and these ideas pay off much better in this movie in terms of visual treats. The actual action itself is pretty violent and pretty intense, but it also has a strange beauty to it all. No matter how many heads you see cut off it never affects you, in fact seeing the blood splash across the battleground is all part of the sheer enjoyment. This isn't a movie for the faint of heart and if you're not a big fan of violence its probably best to avoid this movie.Next thing I will mention is the performances. Now I suppose most of them are pretty average, clunky dialogue just adding to already clunky characters. However amongst some of the dull mannequins of characters there are a few that do stand out. Most noticeable is Gerad Butler as King Leonidas. Butler has had his fair share of pretty rubbish roles, Tomb Raider 2 and Phantom of the Opera are two of many of the bad movies he's featured in. But here he seems perfectly at home, sure he's not likely to win Oscars like Russel Crowe did for Gladiator, but he does a damn good job and makes his character both likable and also semi-believable. The other two performances of not have to be Lena Headey as Leonidas' wife having her own problems back in Sparta, and David Wenham as Dilios.Now then I have to mention the faults I suppose. Unfortunately the are many. The beginning as I have mentioned is a huge fault, and in my eyes the thing that nearly made this movies rating a bit lower. You see despite the beauty of it all, and the good narration, not a lot really happens, and it seems more of a dull way to set up what is to follow than anything else. It was in the beginning that my disappointment kicked in, and admittedly 20mins into the movie I thought I was in for a bitter disappointment. Thankfully it grew on me to the extent I adored the movie by the end. The other moan has to be that apart from the general battle and the fact that Spartans are really hard, there's not much else on display here. The side story in Sparta feels more put together at the last minute than anything else and it never really gels with the rest of the movie. Still 300 is an exhilarating piece of cinema, that while never living up to expectations manages to thrill in its run time.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

A revolution in film making!,"First off, do not, I repeat, do NOT listen or read the comments by these stupid simple minded liberals. All they can do is bitch and moan about the historical inaccuracy, the fighting, the alleged political propaganda, and the lack of plot. Rest assured, these people are the dumbest people on the planet. I didn't see them complaining when Michael Moore's vomitous mess came out years ago. Anyways, this movie was probably the most brilliant movie ever made. Of course it was historically inaccurate but it was supposed to depict the main idea of what happened between Greece and Persia. The acting by the guy who played Leonidas and the one who went to tell the story afterward was in short, amazing. I can't say anything about the graphics, slow motion, and the music because I was absolutely stunned when I saw it for the first time, and have been stunned every time I've seen it since. The word ""revolutionary"" doesn't even begin to describe it. This is a must see for anybody who is a true fan of movies. I'm not saying this is the best movie ever made but I have never seen a movie like that.

Well want to know something critics? Shove it up your a$$, people aren't going to see this movie to experience the most dramatic film ever that will truly leave an everlasting impression on you. There going to see 300 Spartan bada$$es kick the $hit out of a crapload of Persians. And yes, the plot isn't the most developed or the best. But want to know something, I was damn well entertained and I am sure almost every one else was too.

300,"300 never claims to be historically accurate Snyder and Miller have loosely based this movie about the legendary battle.The movie has the visual effects of Sin City but instead of Sin City's black and white with some colour 300 has a very dark feel about it and is in colour though it is clearly computer generated.The Choreography of the fight scenes is excellent and the Spartans fight with great technique and as Snyder said they have been changed so they are historically incorrect to look cool they most certainly do.Each spartan is incredibly well built with no exceptions there is a ripped six pack every where in their army. 300 makes Troy look like a girl scrap and rivals gladiator for its excellent fight scenes, though it is portraying our heroes in a different way they almost push being a hero to the extreme unlike Maximus who is an excellent fighter but does not so much enjoy the killing he does whereas the Spartans love it.I think that its safe to say the Spartans are nothing more than a group of Bad Ass Mother F****rs who can fight like no others and are ready to show it off at any given opportunity, it looks as if their having as much fun as us the audience.The only thing i think 300 lacks in is the emotional power of gladiator, when we should feel sad in 300 its quite hard as we're still recovering from the scenes of mass violence, where as gladiator hits hard with emotional power, however i still feel 300 is a good movie and worth watching and am looking forward to what Snyder has in store next.",,Anonymous,Action
300,"This makes a good history movie if it was real. The movie is 'alright' movie, you watch it because of its fighting, other than that, nothing seem good as the story is straight forward. You know what Frank miller's comics are like, they have graphic violence and sex, not so much on language. The director even made the deaths so detailed, example like when the head was sliced off, you can see what is inside of it. The style of the violence is slow-motion, until you are tired of them fighting in slow-motion but for the first time, you will stare in awe at how the director made the violence slow, slash. The soldiers are cruel, have no feelings, kill those who get in their way, is spartan soldiers like this? No feelings but filled with justice, they just slash and slash without thinking. Do spartan soldiers always like to die for their country? All senseless violence and madness!If you want good story plot, this one does not fit but if you want to watch bloody violence, slice and slash or like war movies, this movie fit your glory...happen that I like its style of violence, I rate 7 out 10, if not 6 out of 10.

About peoples bullcrap,"I will keep this short and sweet I saw 300 tonight and i have to say it was amazing the visuals were stunning it is that good that it looks better than real life. The acting was good i really enjoyed it, the performances were great from all the spartan actors. Gerard butler is a f***n gun his roars and speeches were crazy no body else would fit the part i don't think. The violence please I've spoken to people and they said this had no violence prior to me seeing it and there is enough blood it might not be the bloodiest movie but there's plenty to go round. Now for those who think that this is propaganda against the Persians from the US and for those who think that the movie depicts the Persians as some demonic creatures LET ME GET THIS THROUGH TO PEOPLE Xerxes was the ruler of Persia HIS ARMY WAS A MIXTURE OF 100 NATIONS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. So because he ruled these other nations i guess that those armies become apart of the Persian army. Now if your eyes work you can see Persians in the film and im quite sure that the narration tells you that these other soldiers are from other nations because Xerxes was their ruler. This bull crap of people saying its not accurate and this makes Persians look like barbarians and blah blah seriously back then how many different types of soldiers were barbarians or had barbarian tendencies. I still think people use this as ammunition to feed their twisted minds that the US brought this out as mere propaganda. That having been said im not exactly backing the US up im just giving my point of view WATCH THE MOVIE IT IS AN AWESOME FILM I WAS TOTALLY JACKED UP AFTER THIS AND MAKE YOUR OWN MIND UP ALL THE CRAP I HAVE READ IN PAPERS AND ON THE NET MAKE ME SICK SOMETIMES.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Disappointing,"The fighting was brilliant; the green screen completely suited to this graphic novel adaptation. But I still feel let down by this film. It felt like it was trying to be epic like Gladiator, but also true visually to the graphic novel. And, personally, I don't think you can do both. Although the visuals were stunning and detailed, they were done in a way that focused on the individuals rather than the landscape - which is fine, but this film is long and felt like it should be epic, and so all the lack of attention to the surroundings makes it hard to concentrate for this length of time. The story itself is OK, but it doesn't feel like Sparta is really under threat. This film should have been a lot better than it was, or should have been a lot shorter.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Most fun you'll have this year,"As a young boy, Frank Miller watched the 1962 film ""The 300 Spartans"" and was inspired in the story about 300 Spartans fighting against an army of Persians in The Battle of Thermopylae. As history tells us, 300 Greek soldiers lead by Spartan King Leonidas took on an army 20 times their number and held off the encroaching army long enough so that Greece was able to amass an army that fought off the encroaching Persians in 480 B.C.Miller then took the historical event and gruesome outcome as his muse to pen 300 in 1998 with collaborator and wife Lynn Varley. It was a graphic novel resembling Sin City that pulled no punches and had the pages soaked with blood and carnage.Years later, writer/director Zack Snyder who was coming off the wildly fun and successful Dawn of the Dead (2004) adapted a screenplay based on Miller's mini-series of novels on the battle and churned it into adrenaline pumping glory with the film simply titled 300.The story for the film is simple in structure. 300 soldiers stand ground in a mountain pass against hordes of Persians. The result was blood, decapitations, blood, dismemberments, blood, gore and just a little more blood thrown in for good measure.Sure, there is some backstory that never claims to be historically accurate. We are introduced in the beginning to the Spartan culture where their young children are taken from their families and taught to fight and become tolerant to pain and to the land (all of which are true). It is not long before we are introduced to King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) whose love for their country comes a close second to the love they have for each other.But when a Persian messenger brings word of an army of over 7,000 which will destroy the Greek towns and culture unless they are given land and water, Leonidas stands firm and declares war on the trespassing army. Well, sort of. First, Leonidas tries to get approval from the five Ephors who were Spartas high officials. They refuse Leonidas' suggestion of war (even though there is no history to support their nay vote), but Leonidas still amasses 300 of his personal guards to stand firm in the mountains to protect the women and children that remained behind.So while away at war, Queen Gorgo tries to convince the council to send the entire Greek army to her husbands side in aide of his efforts. Her attempts would prove futile, but what the hell do we care? As bellowed by Leonidas, ""We're in for one wild night."". 300 does not disappoint.If you've seen the trailers or the television spots, you know that violence is the call to order in 300 and Zach Snyder (God Bless Him!) fought off studio pressure to make the film PG-13 and went straight for the heart of the R-rating. We watch as the Spartans repel hundreds and hundreds of Persians led by baddie Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) who is a cross between something on Stargate and Boy George. Their opposing armies leave enough CG blood splatter on the screen to titillate the warrior in all of us.300 is all about the violence, and Zach Snyder does a fantastic job of mixing just the right amount of blood, sweat and tears (all to a rocking score) with scantly clad buffed hunks to keep both genders of the date smiling with delight. There is enough spear chucking, arrow shooting and bone crunching for two or three movies. And when Leonidas stands on the battlefield of fallen Persians and eats an apple while making a speech about being civilized, it is a scene that will resonate long after the drive back home.There is so many good things about 300 that I don't know where to start. The way it was filmed in fast and slow motion video game style, the color scheme which is just dull enough to give a feel of rust, the acting lead by Butler who does a fantastic job of pulling off a role where he needs to be sensitive, intelligent, valiant, suicidal and at times, even humorous.The only thing that bothered me was the inordinate amount of Braveheart type rousing speeches that were shouted in our face before each new onslaught. There is only so much ""Give them nothing! But take from them everything!"" and ""Spartans! Enjoy your breakfast, for tonight we dine in Hell!"" before a ""We Spartans have descended from Hercules himself. Taught never to retreat, never to surrender. Taught that death in the battlefield is the greatest glory he could achieve in his life. Spartans: the finest soldiers the world has ever known"" before even the most engrossed of viewers begin to roll their eyes.But aside from this small drawback, 300 proved to be what I hoped it would when I started to see clips and trailers. It is a rocking ride and so far, the most fun you are going to have at the movies this year.www.robertsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Can you count how many heads are lopped off?,"Normally, I would not elect to watch a movie like this. But as circumstances would have it, I ended up seeing this film and I cannot say I am disappointed. I really did not know what to expect which I suppose helped me enjoy it more. I generally don't go for violence and blood. If you can stand it though, you might just want to see it. It is more comical than disturbing.This film is an over-the-top fantasy war drama 'epic' taking place centuries in the past. Don't rate it for historical accuracy or you will be sorely disappointed. Don't look for great acting. If you need a 'story', please avoid. It is pure eye candy rendered by quality CGI and bigger than life characters. Well-choreographed fight scenes that slow down from time-to-time¬Ö and are not so cluttered that you cannot figure out what is going on and follow the action.I must admit a guilty pleasure at the sight of a big bad guy's head taking leave of his body in slow motion. There are quite a number of heads lopped off, I counted four before I lost track. All in all, this was about the action and the over-the-top characters¬Ö the story was just an excuse. Still I could not take my eyes away from it, and I believe I could even sit through it once more should circumstances have it. I was not bored, and I enjoyed the two kings especially.The Spartan king Leonidas with his strong voice and steadfast determination was an interesting character to watch. I liked him. His enemy, king Xerxes, was the real star of the show to me even though you see little of him. He had an even more resonating voice (as if that were possible) and what must be a computer enhanced screen presence. With his bizarre adornments and self-absorption he is an over-the-top sight to be seen. You just won't get it unless you watch the film.Those self-proclaimed intellectuals who berate this movie because it IS stupid and pointless just don't know how to have fun. I expect adult females will not be disappointed with the myriad of half-naked idealized men in action. Few adolescent males would object to the overt violence and blood. This movie is not for everyone. But, this 40-something, educated straight male was entertained far beyond expectation and I am giving it a 7/10 (much to my amazement).P.S.

First great non pre packaged new action movie I have seen in a while.,"I have forever been a fan of mindless action movies it seems. When I go into a movie theater to catch the latest action film, I do so without the expectation of elaborate plot twists, historical accuracy, or even spectacular special effects. I pay for that movie ticket expecting cheap thrills, though I'll pleasantly welcome anything better.Now, 300 is one fantastic action film that delivered on cheap thrills without being cheap at all. There was enough sex, violence, explosions, shouting, and blood for this film to compete with any of my favorite action films but 300 has done it best. Never, while watching, did I think there was too much of any of it.Most action movies lately tend to cut to about 20 different camera angles during action sequences to give the illusion of intense action. Movies like Troy and Batman Begins fool me into believing a punch landed hard or sword struck true. Each battle shot in 300 was pulled back enough to not only see a single Spartan hacking limbs from single Persian, but I could also see clearly the battle going on behind, in front, and in the foreground and background of the Spartan. There was so much action shown in each frame, I doubt I would have been disappointed in any of the other sides of the big screen I missed. 300 also did not make me cringe in anticipation of the horribly-clich√©d one-liners most action heroes of late spew out.Not only would I recommend any people I know to go see 300, I would ask to go see it again and again with them.

"300: Old Story, New effects.","300: Old Story, New effects.While most movies about the classical period have the epic feel of a long bedtime story, Zack Snyder's 300 broke from the flock with its much shorter length and its cool special effects. Arguably, that was the whole movie.King Leonidas, played by Gerard Butler, leads his Spartan elite corps of 300 against Xerxes' Persian hordes- fighting for freedom, reason, civility, and the like. Obviously the Spartan warrior culture hardly stands for those concepts by today's standards, but for them, it was something to die for. A modern day equivalent of Leonidas' plight might take place in a courtroom in the form of an ""Erin Brockovich"" versus ""some corporation"".The film, however, doesn't really focus on the didactic potential of the story. But instead showcases the grind of ancient combat, souped up by effects we may more closely associate with the Matrix series.Personally, I dumped those thoughts out of my mind, as well as obvious similarities to Gladiator (partially because of certain scenes, partly because I think Butler totally looks like Russell Crowe) and found the movie overall very enjoyable.I analyzed it to death afterward, and it went something like this: The film was obviously unreal. I mean I don't doubt that the 300 Spartans must have been a clever and disciplined bunch, but Xerxes couldn't care more with his melange of immortals, Mongoloid mercenaries, elephants, and such. It was a modern adaptation, for a modern audience, done through modern cultural vision goggles- it can't possibly be real.So what, then, it's about the special effects; the shock of gore and the psycho-emotional thrill ride (it was Frank Miller's idea, so expect Sin City elements), isn't it? If so, is it all bad? Doesn't this idea encapsulate all modern media? If we were to take the spunk out of it all- action without effects, comedy without laugh track, drama without constant music- would it stand on its own? Would we be interested without the hype of glamour and gloss? Reality blows, obviously, and story-telling is an art that requires those psycho-emotional thrill rides.This is a depressing thought but I'm sure most of you will continue to enjoy media's special effects, I know I will. I enjoyed 300, albeit it lacks the aftertaste of other better movies. The silly analysis of modern media came later, which isn't very important.Upon second thought, this movie is actually a cash cow. Whenever a movie lacks original plot, didactic plot in favour of special effects, the cash cow possibility kicks in. To compound that, I know I've mentioned that the film can't possibly be real, here's one more reason why (pay attention ladies and 10% of you men): Those buff Spartans are all half naked! Please refer to your Classics professor about whether or not Spartans wore breast plates and shin pads like the rest of those classical soldiers. As if that wasn't enough, I don't know what you all use for shaving purposes but I find it dubious that the Greeks of old had such luxuries(so they were fit, cleanly shaved, and half naked, whew).For what it's worth, 300 is a good cash cow.-G.G.",,Anonymous,Action
"A 300 for Effects, a 3 for Story","This visual spectacle based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller is diverting as it beautiful. The film tells the story of King Leonidas and the 300 other Spartans who fought in the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. against over a million blood thirsty warriors. Gerard Butler best known for his lead portrayal in The Phantom of the Opera and his villainous turn in Dracula 2000 plays the headstrong king. Butler who has become a steady pretty face in Hollywood takes the action hero role to a new level.With memorable one liners, Butler reinvents the clich√© hero like Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jean Claude Van Damme have in the past.. With poor dramatic moments, the role doesn't demand a well equipped character actor but abs, muscles, and strong facial features. The acting revelation if you could even call it, comes from ""King Leonidas'"" supportive wife, ""Queen Lorgo"" played exquisitely by the breakout star of the year, Lena Headey. She sizzles the screen with more than her looks but with striking pain-stricken ability to scene steal as if it were a crime. Her Queen is one of the stronger supportive wife turns to hit the screen in our new century.Dominic West who is one of the stronger supporting actors working today plays cowardly villain role reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's ""Commodus"" in Gladiator. As brief as the role is, it leaves sour taste and gut wrenching imprints on the viewer post-film. The rest of the cast do what their roles demand but nothing out of the ordinary.Visual effects, sound, and powerful cinematography are the brighter parts of the film. You can't help but admire the fascinating choice to shoot this film as a Michelangelo portrait with beautiful scenery and outstanding results. Engaging as the film is don't look for character depth or emotional connections as this is a watch and go picture. Be entertained as you can.Grade: **¬Ω/****",6.0,Anonymous,Action

See for the visuals alone!,"Zack Snyder is a director with a lot of potential. This was his second film after the Dawn Of The Dead remake but since this he has moved on to direct Watchmen and Sucker Punch, both with great visual effects that wow audiences, and he is working on the Christopher Nolan produced Superman reboot Man Of Steel as we speak. 300 was his first effort with the comic book visuals. It has been done before with a previous Frank Miller comic book adaptation in Sin City, but here we have it on a different scale entirely. Here we witness epic battles as if they were a moving comic book.300 is about the war at Thermopylae in 480 B.C., which was fought between the Spartans and the Persians. The Persian army has begun to take over Greece and requests that King Leonidas of the Spartan's (Butler) joins in his new empire. Leonidas however realises that this would mean slavery for his women and children and this he can't accept, so he declares war on the Persian Empire which consists of one hundred thousand warriors. Due to Leonidas' disrespect, the King of Persia marches to take Sparta but Leonidas recruits 300 Spartan men, plus 700 Thespian soldiers, and blockades them in a narrow valley which will mean numbers mean nothing. For three days the Spartans hold off the barbaric attacks from the Persians, whilst back in his homeland his wife comes under attack by other Spartans who aim to take over Leonidas' thrown. It is a fairly simple plot as all it really sets up is a lot of battle sequences, and I tell you now this is the plus side about this movie.The film does have a story but it doesn't ever go off on tangents nor have many sub-plots. There is little character development or back story and very minimal realistic dialogue. (Some of the dialogue is good it just sounds very preachy). The film isn't about the lack of key elements I have described above; it is all about the epic battle scenes and the togetherness of the Spartan army that will fight till the death.It does simply consist of battle after battle. The short talky scenes in the middle are a little dull and you only ever want to see the fight scenes, and when they happen you are not disappointed. We see slow motion shots of decapitations, spears landing in chests, blood splattering over the floor in a comic book fashion. It is such a different take on a battle film. The colours are stunning, the reds and yellows really bring a different visual film. It is worth a watch for the visuals alone. You shouldn't be put off by the content of the film. The epic battle films are not my favourite genre, but if you put up with that for the sake of the brilliant visuals of this film you may change your mind.The acting is also top notch. All actors take on their roles brilliantly and I actually believed that they were in fact Spartan warriors and not the actual actor. Butler is lost in the role and we actually see the Spartan he is betraying. That may be because he is hiding being a bushy beard and a rippling six pack though. The only time he becomes recognisable is when he shouts his epic line, 'this is Sparta', which we have all come to know him for since the release of this film. All the other actors are also great in their roles and we also get a very good Michael Fassbender in a side role. Little did he know back then what brilliance awaited him.The film is a good watch. You will be confused and lost by much of it, like when the Persian leader is fully pierced, or at the Quasimodo look a like's cameo, but you will be completely enthralled by the battles. I know little about the history of this moment, but as far as I'm concerned I have seen what I wanted to know. The visuals are breath taking, the direction and acting brilliant, the camera work ace. See it for those reasons and you can forget about the lack of anything else it really has.3.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Visually breathtaking if glaringly flawed,"At a first, objective glance, I find it incredibly easy to dismiss this film. It suffers from everything from genre clich√©s ¬ñ so yeah, the wailing woman soundtrack worked well on Gladiator but that doesn't mean it has to be used in every historical epic made ¬ñ to a screenplay emptier than the dark pit into which the Spartans cast their enemies; and with such an excessive use of slow-motion photography, one wonders just how short the film would actually be had the entire thing been played at normal speed. Despite this, at the same time, I found 300 to be nothing short of a groundbreaking achievement. And if one looks a little further outside of the box at this film, one will see that there is much more than meets the eye.Despite its obviously out-of-the-box nature, I can't convince myself to ignore some glaringly problematic flaws the film suffers from. While its action scenes keep the blood pumping and the adrenaline flowing, I must admit that during most of the scenes in which killing of some kind was not depicted, I found myself indifferent and bored. The filmmakers attempted to interweave a subliminal political/social message into the film ¬ñ some dribble about glory and freedom ¬ñ which came across as forced, ridiculous and underplayed. Also, I found the utter lack of any characterization to be an irritating distraction. The previous Frank Miller adaptation, Sin City, was populated by caricatures. This time around, 300 is populated by nothing less than cardboard cut-outs; characters so utterly devoid of any traits or characteristics or anything interesting whatsoever about them that it's beyond the level of stereotypes. The acting too was mostly problematic, with Gerard Butler delivering a borderline-irritating performance, shouting and screaming for dramatic effect alone without even an ounce of conviction or sincerity in his words. The rest of the actors seem to be practically sleepwalking through the entire show. The film almost ¬ñ but not quite ¬ñ makes up for these glaring flaws with its incredible achievements in other fields, but I really feel that these problems drag it down and could have easily been fixed to create a truly compelling work. But alas, no film is perfect.Unsurprisingly, probably one of the most noticeable aspects of the film's screenplay is its exaggerated, unbelievable, outrageous and sometimes downright ridiculous over-the-top nature. But since Snyder and Miller so cleverly book ended the film with a subjective storyteller, effectively they give themselves total freedom to spin the tale what which way they please. If you think about it, this really gives them the artistic license to include the over-exaggerations, the glorifying, and the outrageousness: monstrous creature-men, terrifying mutants, giant god-kings, over-sized elephants and other creatures, and so on. Actually, I quite liked this aspect, as it added a totally original spin to the classic, historic tale. Indeed, had 300 been a regular sword-and-sandals historical epic, I doubt it would really have anything new or interesting to add to the genre. By in actual fact crafting what can most easily be described as a fantasy film, Snyder and Miller portray the genre in a fresh, new, imaginative way as never has been seen before.I am not a big supporter of the digital revolution. I think that movies like George Lucas' Star Wars prequels and to a lesser extent most any other significant action film from the past few years overuse and abuse the CGI tool to the point of excessiveness, and it all just comes across as terribly, unimpressive laziness. The two major flaws of over-using CGI is that it isn't well developed enough to carry an entire movie realistically and convincingly, and the other is that it really comes across as lazy and negligent ¬ñ Lucas' Star Wars prequels in particular are living proof of everything that is bad about CGI. But in 2005, Robert Rodriguez treaded new ground in the CGI territory, and with 300 now Zack Snyder takes the CGI tool to entirely revolutionary levels. Instead of using CGI to replace reality, Snyder uses it to create imagery that is otherwise utterly impossible to create in a practical manner. By doing this, I can truly and honestly say that Snyder has crafted a groundbreaking film that uses CGI not as a tool but as an art form.And I don't say this lightly whatsoever. Indeed, this total freedom Snyder has given himself by filming on blue screen sets allows him to craft what may be one of the most visually creative, unique and utterly astoundingly beautiful films of all time. I'm not exaggerating when I say that every single shot of this film is a heart stopping, breathtakingly gorgeous work of art; a renaissance masterpiece of the modern age. The sepia tones, the golden gleam, the striking dark shadows, the contrasts, the vibrancy¬Ö this film is simply put, visually astounding.In all, notwithstanding the ridiculous plot and story elements, painfully flat characters and boring, pointless talky scenes, 300 is a totally unique, brilliantly creative and an arrestingly visual masterpiece: With the most creative and breathtakingly artistic use of CGI imagery in any movie, 300 may just pave the path to a new, entirely visually liberated style of film-making. And if one views the film as a fantasy piece as opposed to a historical epic, one realizes that it's all in fun and just an entertaining, wildly crazy ride. Still, some flaws are too glaring to forgive, and had the film sharpened itself in terms of characters and story, it would have been far better than it actually is.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Straight-forward, stylized action that truly delivers","There aren't many action movie like '300'. In here, we follow the legendary battle between 300 spartan warriors, lead by King Leonidas, against the invading forces of thousands from the Persian Empire lead by Xerxes.By now, this almost mythological story has been more than debunked (there were thousands of spartans in that battle, not just the three hundred) but, unlike what many people seem to believe, the film is actually based on a comic book and not in the actual historical facts (the comic itself was only loosely based on reality). This is mostly a fantasy-action, and trying to dismiss it for its historical inaccuracy is just stupid.The movie itself is one of the strongest actioners I've seen. From what I've seen from the director, Zack Snyder ('Dawn of the Dead' remake and 'Watchmen'), I'm quite happy that he directed this; he is not the kind to shy away from the intense violence such a battle would create. The fantastic visuals of the film (a trademark of Snyder; even his dreadful 'Sucker Punch' had good visuals despite all its flaws) and the stylized way the narrative and battle choreography are done are brilliant; it brings a quasi-psychopathic satisfaction seeing the 300 fight and kill their enemies.Another high point is that the movie has something akin to a brain, despite all the violence. The dialogues between Leonidas and the Persians (the messenger at the beginning, and Xerxes later on) are very interesting and intelligently done, serving to further convey how prideful/arrogant both groups are. The political side story involving Leonidas' wife's discussions with the city/state council, trying to get the rest of Sparta to join the fight against the Persians, is also unexpectedly good.For the most part, the casting was very well done. The spartans truly look their part, a race of strong and prideful warriors; Gerard Butler, in special, has a very strong presence that truly makes him suitable to play the part as their leader. Lena Headey, who plays his wife, is beautiful to look at and the way she plays her character she not only looks worthy of a queen, but of the queen of a warrior nation.Maybe the only thing I didn't like was the casting of Rodrigo Santoro. As a fellow Brazilian, I knew him mostly from his work on soap operas: always being the pretty boy who is just there to make women swoon in a clich√©d romance subplot. The fact he had to be digitally modified in order to make himself appear threatening (not just his height, but even his voice too) shows how much he was ideal for this role. Why not cast someone who was already menacing?",9.0,Anonymous,Action
The best comic adaptation I ever seen,"One thing is the historical event, and other is the interpretation of this history to a graphic novel and then to a picture, some people say the picture is just a remake of the 1962's 300 Spartans, but is not. The picture is totally enjoyable, is a great experience for all who enjoy comic books.Look at the graphic novel by Frank Miller (Sin City), just take a few minutes to view how the graphic novel, and the movie match almost perfectly, the novel seems to be the movie story board.As in sin city movie the photography is made to match the graphic stile of the comic book. the colors in this movie are equal to the novel, Leonidas character, is almost the same in both. all in this movie is perfectly made, there's no mediocrity.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Great war movie... except for all that stuff about the war,"300 is a great film. It is exciting, well produced, includes great and believable acting, great story, enough blood and guts to satisfy anyone....BUT (there's always a but) its references to today really take away from the story and all of its great elements. Hearing ""freedom isn't free"" come out of the mouth of a Spartan is just NOT believable. Or what about freeing the world of tyranny? George Bush, you're thinking? No. Another Spartan soldier in 300. Or of course the enemy fighting for their god - ring a bell? I won't even get into the female character's role in a pre-feminist setting but with some obviously post-feminism ideals.In the end, I still came out of 300 feeling like it was a good film. But I also felt like I had just seen some subliminal propaganda at the same time. Which is something really unfortunate. Rather than making a timeless war film, it turned into ""Iraq War & Terrorism -Except They're Persians Now.""",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Well executed,"I tend to like flicks that cover historical events so I thought I would give '300' a go. Before dealing with the plot, I must say that the featured scenery is first class. There is something special about the scenery that makes it sort of magic, as though there was some sort of mysterious magic filter processing the video content.I do not feel that I am in a position to press charges against any of the actors due to poor performances. Gerard Butler does his job great indeed acting as King Leonidas. What I do feel though is, that the flick unfolds a bit too fast to the point where the Spartan army finds itself at war with the Persians. At any rate, the violent scenes of the war are well executed and I found the balance to be decent between art and war.In conclusion, I give '300' a solid 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
An original. Well-aged.,"This movie ages well.When I first saw this movie mid 2000, I did not really like it too much:
""I've seen it all""
""Just another action flick, trying to boast and exaggerate""But a few years later: Nothing can compare.This movie just does it right.Everything is unique.There are so many memes derived from it. Why? To make fun of it?No. But because it is perfectly depicted. And it is just the go-to for exactly this moment or mood that you want to deliver.So how does 300 achieve that?The acting is top notch. Production design and costumes are top notch.Even that I know, that Gerard Butler plays Leonidas: I do not see it. Regardless how often I watch this movie.It is just Leonidas.And the story?Actual historical background - but with a twist to it: You are listening to a story. Told by the remaining of the 300.You could even say ""polanskiesque"": Not a happy ending, but a hopeful one.A true legend.An original.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Great looking movie that succeeds simply with coolness,"What a strange and at the same time fascinating movie... I never was a fan of movies without any sense, movies that just want to be ""cool"". And so I expected the worst from 300. But I was somewhat surprised when I saw it. First you must know: if you are someone, who hates movies with stupid plots really hard, then you won't like 300. But if you are someone, who also gives such movies a chance, you should watch it. 300 has no story with surprising twists, dramatic highlights or something like that. 300 is simply a comic-style-war-movie. But unlike similar works like ""King Arthur"" oder ""Troy"", which somehow failed because they were stupid and had no style, 300 manages to be incredibly cool in dialogs and visual appearance. In fact, this is the only movie that wins by looking great, and nothing else.I can understand, that many people don't like the movie, but if you give the art of how it appears a chance, you may like it.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

A Stunning Visual Feast.,"I have actually been to Thermpolaye, when I went on a Classical Tour in the mid 1990s. The setting of the battlefield in the 300 looked nothing like the terrain that I saw, but it makes for a better picture I guess. I've been waiting for this film on DVD ..I wanted to see it on cinema, but time wasn't on my side.Well, finally watched it, thoroughly enjoyed it. Its the rumours that circulated around the film, ""its homo-erotic"" or ""its racist""... Maybe I missed something, but I didn't really see that aspect of it. Yes there's nudity and the uglier features of Spartan Society are actually laid bare. The Spartans were very, very religious and that really should've been explored more.Anyway, the film, a visual feast, for those who like battle scenes. The slow motion scenes were truly effective and the mixture of animation and reality was brilliant. It added to the mystique of the times. If I was to cast my eyes on disappointment, it would be the historic inaccuracies and the geographical betrayal. Cold winters and cloudy weather....Were talking Greece here!!! Its hot and the Countryside, especially around Thermopolaye, is hilly and arrid. Olive trees and bushells. The water was calm and battles spanning from the time of Antiquity to the Mediavel era were campaigns that took place in the summertime. Anyhow...A visual feast, I was impressed with Gerard Butler's Leonidas, when he calls to his men, eat hearty this morning, for by the night we shall be dining in hell...unfortunately, he should've said..with the gods!!! David Wenham, as Pelios, commanding performance, excellent narration and a mixture of his previous character in Van Helsing was a nice touch!!! Anyway, definitely a ""must view""...Just for the Battles and the mysticism. The biggest contradiction of all, ws that Spartan society was not only religious, it was extremely conservative, when hearing Leonidas talk of freedom, justice and reason...I did think, ""hang on a minute""!! Because it was the Spartans under Lysander that beat Athenians in the Pelyopinesian Wars..and destroyed a society that actually strived for those virtues. Anyway...Enjoy the film.",,Anonymous,Action
"This movie is a masterpiece that often gets downplayed because of how stylish, artistic and well done it is...people look for holes that aren't there","300 (2006) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows the rise of the Persian Empire as they have unified Northern Africa, Persia and much of the Middle East. They are now prepared to ask Sparta to give up their land and rule willingly and join the Persians. Sparta doesn't wish to be ruled but their profits have been paid off to tell the king not to go to war, so he wont. The king and 300 of his closest friends, go out to meet the Persians and see what happens.This movie is directed by Zach Snyder (Watchmen) and stars Gerard Butler (Law Abiding Citizen), Michael Fassbender (Shame), Lena Headey (Game of Thrones), Vincent Regan (Troy) and Dominic West (The Chicago).The storyline and narration for this movie is magnificent. The cinematography, use of colors and makeup, film angles and the way film is sped up and slowed down is absolutely brilliant and very artistic (in a Sin City kind of way). The cast is perfectly selected and you can tell a lot of work went into the look and feel of the characters. The mixture of muscle versus creature was so fun as was the comradery between characters. This movie was awesome from beginning to end.Overall this movie is a masterpiece that often gets downplayed because of how stylish, artistic and well done it is...people look for holes that aren't there. I would score this an easy 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Nice,"Hmm, very weird movie. It was a friend of mine who first told me about this title. Right after he told me I went to IMDb to read some reviews. They all clearly state that you don't have to go to the theater to see it if you like story lines in a movie. Well, as I like the plot of a movie more than brainless hash and slash action, I didn't like going to this movie at all.But yeah, the problem with friends is they convince you all the time. We were going to see this movie to go out right after it. So there we sat. After the credits our opinions were very different. I thought they should've given more attention to the story, my friends said they did. Well, what do I have to do now? I decided to watch it again.Then, yesterday, I watched the movie again. Now not prejudiced. I have to say, it seemed a lot better to me this time. The storyline isn't that bad at all, and the action is just fantastic. Every screenshot of the movie looks like if you can make a poster out of it. Wow.These two totally different experiences of the movie make it hard to give this movie a vote. The second time I watched it it simply seemed better to me. When I use my second experience I would give it an 8/10, for the first time watching I would give it a 6/10.(+ great action) (+ very nice edited, every screenshot looks like a poster) (+ you really get a manly ""spartan"" feeling) (- the storyline still could've been better)I'll vote 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Based on both historical fact and Frank Miller's graphic novel, ""300"" brings alive the legendary 300 Sparta soldiers.Gerard Butler is truly powerful as King Leonidas, the leader who takes the men off to battle despite the disapproval of council. The battle scenes are extraordinary and unlike anything we have seen on film before. The hand to hand combat is breathless at times and the creatures of Xerxes army are quite the colorful lot, as his Xerxes himself (played flamingly by Rodrigo Santoro).The weakness of the film comes from the lack of dramatic energy within the boundaries of Sparta.

Visually Stunning,"Having just finished watching this film, I can only describe it as a work of art. Some could describe this as a slash and blood special effects story, true the dialogue is simple and melodramatic.

This is not a film as gus495 said in his comments for those who want complicated plots and twists; it is a film for those who want strong leaders showing as much courage as those they command.Don't get me wrong, many movies today try to bring the same feeling. Troy is one that springs to mind immediately, while this shows Brad Pitt's body off, it feels like a fashion show with the whole film designed around a single actor or two.300 goes beyond Hollywood's usual trip and shows that films special effects can be used as a work of art with as much impact a painting, bringing to life the feel and grit of battle.If you want an experience above the norm, I would watch this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Machismo at an apex.,"wow. just wow. with all movies, I try my best to be as balanced in my judgment as possible. I always look for the best features in movies as well as the worst drawbacks, while still noticing the little things. as I write this review of 300, I fail to think of anything negative to say about this film. there have been very few cases where I have found myself nigh-speechless because of the greatness of a movie, and this was one of them. seriously, I cannot express how much I love this film. I almost never say this after seeing a movie for the first time, but this is one of the best films I've ever seen.300 is an adaptation of the superb graphic novel from Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. if you've read it, then you realize that the visuals are some of the most unique and well done one could hope to see in the medium and the story is well written and engrossing. for those who haven't, nothing has prepared you for this (to borrow the tag-line from the Mortal Kombat movie). in the film, the writers Kurt Johnstad, Michael Gordon, and Zack Snyder (who also directed the film) copies wonderfully the lines from the novel, with some extra depth added to it for cinematic purposes. Snyder's direction is pretty much flawless here. to be totally honest, the only other movie i'm sure i've seen with his direction was the fantastic remake of Dawn Of The Dead, so I have little to compare his past work to 300 with. with this endeavor, though, he's obviously shown he can hang with the greatest directors. I must also gives mad props (yeah, I just said that) to the photography crew, for they are the unsung heroes of this picture.the story follows The Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in 480 B.C. Greece. it's not so much a historically accurate telling, but rather an almost exact depiction of the source material. King Leonidas of Sparta marches to his destiny with a handful of loyal men to face against the overwhelming Persian armies of Xerxes, and his wife Queen Gorga desperately tries to assist her love in any way she can. admittedly, more of the movie's focus in on Leonidas' side of the tale, yet it never feels as if Gorga's story is pushed aside. there are various subplots as well, which are all very well done (a welcome surprise, indeed). the drama is never overdone or undercooked, and it works practically seamlessly with the ridiculously incredible action pieces. the acting here is top notch, and rather unique in it's own way.first off, let me say that I cannot imagine anyone else doing as good a job as Leonidas as Gerald Butler did. if you've seen the most recent film version of The Phantom Of The Opera, you know that he gives a commanding presence. he has the gripping ability to fill his voice full of passion, rage, courage, and you cannot help but shut your mouth and listen up (imagine Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket, but 10 times louder). this could not be any truer with his performance in 300. he is perfectly cast as the Spartan king who leads his people for the defense of their future. also as well chosen is Lena Headey as Queen Gorga, who captivates the audience with her strength and resolve, the likes of which we've often seen in movies. she, however gives the role her all, and it shows here. Rodrigo Santoro is fantastic as King Xerxes, the cruel ruler who believes himself a god while conquering countless enemies. with a height that even dwarfs Leonidas and a voice almost as forceful, we cannot help but realize that, had we been in the place of the Spartans, we would s**t our pants at the sight of him standing before us with armies ready at a whim. there are also many other fine performances from slightly more minor characters, but overall there is something interesting about the acting. in 300 there is no single outstanding performance, despite how well done some are. instead, all the performances equally join together to form one cohesive group of strength through numbers...much like the way of the Spartan army, really.arguably, the greatest appeal of 300 is the visual mastery all throughout ever single piece of celluloid. the contrast between darkness and light is perfectly matched. camera angles are used strategically to give us the most of every shot, and the slow motion switch battle takes your attention hostage. it perfectly shows you the intricate detail of the fighting, while never letting you forget the intensity of the battle. I really cannot say as much about the eye-candy (not referring to the topless women or muscular men) as I want, you just have to experience it for yourself. just as well-realized as the imagery of Sin City, if not more.simply put, this movie is an amazing, well crafted, and hugely memorable example of load-blowing cinematic awesomeness. it's indeed rare to see cinema done so violently, graphically, and unflinchingly while still standing above as a form of art. I recommend this to anyone who wants to have a great movie-going experience, to anyone who admires visual excellency, and to anyone enjoys some good ass-kicking fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

The Critic and the Geek,"Every film is made for a reason. Some films are made to entertain, others to educate. I'm sure Zack Snyder (the excellent Dawn of the Dead remake) had one thing on his mind when he was making 300; create the most faithful comic book movie yet. Sin City, another film based on a Frank Miller comic book that was shot using bluescreens, was criticized for being ""style over substance"". 300 takes that concept to the next level. In 300, the style is the substance. The film is a shot-for-shot adaptation of the comic book. In fact, some shots are lifted directly from the graphic novel (the scene where the Spartans push their enemies off a cliff comes to mind). Needless to say, the film, which tells the story of the Battle of Thermopylae between 300 Spartans and (estimated) 1 million Persians, is extremely beautiful to look at. Imagine visiting Le Louvre and you're pretty close. Every single frame is like a painting.Some people have been talking about how the action genre is dead. 300 proves them wrong. Basically, the second half is one massive fight, with limbs flying, heads spinning, and blood splattering across the frame. As you might expect, the film is pretty violent, so if you're a parent, you might want to leave the kids at home. Snyder shines in those action scenes. He has a lot of tricks up his sleeve. Slow mos, fast forwarding, zooming, and rapid-fire cuts are all used to perfection. And hats off to whoever choreographed the fights. They were poetic.With the visuals being at the top of the filmmakers' agenda, characterization had to take a back seat. All the characters are either black (evil) or white (good), with no shades of grey whatsoever (believe it or not, the most complex character is Ephialtes the hunchback, who has about 5 minutes of screen time). Take Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler, in a decent performance) and his army for instance. They spend their whole screen time kicking butts, delivering big speeches and uttering cool lines. OK, so they're fearless and heroic. What else do we know about them? Zip. None. We barely know them, so they don't earn our sympathy. Remember how you were emotionally invested in characters like William Wallace (Braveheart) and Maximus (Gladiator)? I'm fairly confident you won't feel the same way here. Also in some scenes, the film was way too weird for its own good. I mean, I doubt we'll be seeing a man-goat rocking out in any other film this year.I really don't know how to grade 300. The geek in me, who has seen the film 3 times so far and has a giant 300 poster hanging down his wall, wants to give it a 10. On the other hand, the ""critic"", who rates films based on plot and characters and whatnot, wants to give it 4 or something. So, I guess my grade should be somewhere in between",7.0,Anonymous,Action
soundtrack,"I enjoyed the film. The European culture is descendant of the Greek culture. Recently I made a discovery: The melody of ""Message for the Queen"" is an age-old Bulgarian (or for that matter Slavic-Macedonian) song. The quickest reference is in YouTube, (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQPQemLmO0) but a thorough search in Internet will give you the idea. There is no copyright for folk-songs, however it would be nice from the authors of the film to cite this somewhere. It is just sad that the melodies of the Balkans touch the souls of all their nations, but the nations do not credit each other and quarrel.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
You have got to see this,"I have just seen 300 and I have to say it is absolutely brilliant. I am not usually a fan of such an epic movies but I have enjoyed every minute of it. I didn't know much about it when I start watching, but at the end I could see Frank Miller's touch on the colours in the movie, that dark comic book kind of atmosphere and that you know throughout the whole movie that a legend is told right before your eyes: and yet the blood spatter, all so favourite of Miller. It wasn't enough blood shed in Sin city; here he is back and thirsty. Yet it is not a mindless bloodbath that aims to make you sick, it is really well presented, when you actually look at it the blood is very dark wine red colour and is more in your mind rather than your eyes. What else is in front of your eyes ladies, are 300 super physically fit men running around half naked the hole movie, it is absolutely spectacular. And you will all enjoy the steaming hot scene with the king and his queen. I have to say that them both Gerard Butler and Lena Headey give a great performance. Hats off for my new favourite actor too, Dominic West as Thereon, he is just so sweet to play a baddie-absolutely brilliant. Another thing that amazed me about this movie is that it is totally believable. You would think with all that screaming and courage all over the place, and how the heck 300 Spartans are going to defeat countless army, some of them immortal, how they are going to convince me that this is actually possible. The key is strategy. They are very wise and well coordinated in every move, they fight as one, they fight smart and tactical. It kept me with anticipation to see what is going to be their next move against enemy's next hit. If there is such a thing as beautiful warfare, this is it. I sincerely recommend this movie to everyone and anyone; you will enjoy every bit of it for it is a real piece of cinema art. Absolutely brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Beware the distinction between movie and truth!!!,"7/10SHOULD I, like my good friend and an astonishing number of reviewers here at IMDb, deride this movie on the grounds of what it lacks?Could I have made it a better movie? Most certainly not.SO, my comments ought to be centered around what is actually CAN do:It was a FIREWORKS display of well-choreographed cartoon reality. Cartoon reality is, as we know, often at liberty to twist facts to suit the story. Why this is so with cartoons, and not to the same degree in singularly font-based storytelling, I do not know. But I accept it as a pretext.I watch movies with my feelings. If a movie manages to convince me of its story - the logical framework being whole, and by this I don't mean not having plot holes, but the story in its entirety - it bypasses my head. This mechanism is not unknown to creators in any line of work. ""I buy it"". Which is the sole purpose of any product. ""I buy into it"" - I accept the reality of it.I am not well educated, and know next to nothing of the ancient history. Am also well aware of the illusion that those who know not their history are deemed to repeat it ( - ""illusion"", because I see this upholding of History as not keeping anyone from aggression and greed. On the contrary it takes people away from themselves and the moment... Excuse the digression...) And I am aware that what takes place on the screen is a rendition of reality. Of one man (or a small collective of men) 's perception of leftovers from an era long gone, albeit analyzed over and over by academics, but still only one man's version or vision.That I feel the impact of the movie is due to the fact that this man manages to portray a wholeness. Do I believe it to be true? I do not. It is a version. Am I fulfilled? On some levels, yes - but not like with a Tarkovsky or Coppola (to draw from very different movie-making expressions). ""300"" works. It completes its mission to persuade me to come closer and believe in the story - not as truth, but as movie. BEWARE THE DISTINCTION.I couldn't care less if this was far from or close to the truth. It takes place in an altogether different universe from the one my forefathers lived in, and had their fun on the battle fields and in the subjugation of the weaker, because they could.300 is a vehicle for messages about an impression of a or the human condition. Freedom, honour, glory - these definitions need dusting off from time to time in order for us to see something to believe in, which is not controlled by religion or money. What we would term ""inner value"". Okay, so ""300"" defines it as well worth dying for, in order to defend a way of life. Funnily this mechanism is what everyone uses in order to define the term ""human"".The mechanism. Not the content. Very big distinction. We all put something inside of our definition of human, if we *need* to define it, rather than just be our own best example.300 is not an altogether bad way of stating an opinion about what is needed.Okay - bright people can work on pretexts. They can assume a position and argue from that POW. Without being there. And as such be opportunists, who will give the receiving end what the receiving end believes it needs at the moment - without themselves acknowledging anything but the fact that ""these mechanisms work"".THIS is what I should look for, if in a criticism of this movie I should venture beyond my instinctive reaction. ""Do they themselves believe in their words?"" What say my instinct?6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Completely Amazing!,"Ya know what?? Forget about historical accuracy or realism. ""300"" has little of that. But it doesn't matter. This is an amazing work of art. Yes, it's a violent work of art, but it's incredible nonetheless.I found practically every shot visually stunning. The color choices, the flow of movement, the camera angles, all overlayed with majestic music, this film is one of the most fantastic visual/audible experiences I've seen on film in quite a while. This is the first western film I've seen that truly emulates the majesty of such Oriental visual classics as ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"". It's absolutely brilliant.I think that, as a society, we've completely forgotten that film is a visual medium. That's a very odd thing to say, but it's true. When one really wants to create artistry on the screen, one has to remember film is really a canvas, a bare receptacle ready for whatever one wants to throw at it.Most filmmakers want to tell a story and put that story on the screen. And that's fine. But all they are really doing is putting that story into life (i.e. real actors in real settings), and simply using the camera to capture that story for show on a screen. Sure, that can work fine (witness Stephen Spielberg and other great filmmakers).But what Yimou Zhang does with his fantastic films, and what Robert Rodriguez, Zack Snyder, and Frank Miller have done with ""Sin City"" and ""300"", is actually craft visual masterpieces directly for the screen itself. They aren't simply taking pictures of a story, they are actually crafting directly for the projection screen at your Googleplex Cinema.This difference between capturing an image, and CRAFTING an image, is understood by world-renowned, artistic photographers, and it is my hope films such as ""300"" will help spread this understanding among filmmakers.Oh, and the film has lots of beheadings. Gotta love beheadings.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Earth and Water...,"""Earth and Water..."" As the Persian messenger says near the beginning of the film, this is a film about an immense war over the Earth and Water in the city of Sparta. Due to the ignorant politics in Sparta, a king and his army of just 300 soldiers must defend what they love against an army of millions.300 is an epic depiction of the battle of Thermopylae, and how 300 Spartans used strength, passion, fearlessness and tactics to fight. An army of millions means nothing next to these qualities.300 beholds a very expertly executed demonstration of how Spartans fight. There shall be no one in the cinema audience who is not staring in awe as King Leonidas slaughters man after man after man. There'll be triumph as the Spartans turn the surroundings against the enemy, obliterating the opposition through intelligent strategies. There'll be fear in the hearts of the viewer as the 300 Spartans fight an enemy so large, their marches create earthquakes, so massive, they drink the rivers dry.300 induces all the emotions the creators intended it to.The use of CGI is to be triumphed over, not one creature looks fake in this movie. You may have seen in the trailer, the rhinoceros, the uber immortal, the elephants, all such convincing beasts.The use of imagery in 300 is unlike any other movie, the style of every single frame is admirable. It overall amounts to a very powerful feel throughout the movie.And at the end of the epic journey which is 300, you will be inspired.

"Make the correct choice and see ""300"" - AAHOOOOO!!!","(My Synopsis) ""300"" is based on a true event, the Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in August of 480 B.C. in Greece. King Leonidas took his personal fighting force of 300 Spartans to their certain death to fight against the invading Persian army of King Xerxes. The Persians had an army of over a million men with the intent to enslave the people of Greece and make it part of the Persian Empire. This small force of brave men along with some Greek allies blocked the Thermopylae Pass which was the only road that King Xerxes could travel to get to the major Greek cities. The Spartan's last stand showed the world their extraordinarily valor and great sacrifice against tremendous odds which united all of Greece to defeat the Persian invaders. As the Spartan Women would say, ""Come home with your shield or on it."" ""AAHOOOOO!!!""(My Comment) The story is awesome and incredible that speaks to the age-old battle between good and evil. The movie is slow at first, but the pace speeds up and before you know it, the 2 hour movie is over. There are a number of short battle scenes that are intense and keep your attention and the action moving and interesting. I actually jumped around in my seat as if I were in the battle with the Spartans. This battle is a perfect example of what our soldiers of today must have and know when fighting a war. They must have better training and equipment then the enemy, and knowledge of how to use the terrain to their advantage. This battle is exactly the same story the U.S. is facing today, when we are faced with choices between compromise and war. The entire Spartan army was not sent into battle because they were celebrating the Carneian Festival, and the rest of the Greek allies were celebrating the Olympic Festival. When you are fighting for freedom and democracy, you must make the right choice. This movie is not a factual history lesson, but I would hope that people that see the movie will go a little further and research the historic facts about the battle as I did. It was estimated that about 20,000 Persians were killed at this battle. The true facts and figures may be hard to come by since this battle happen 2,486 years ago. As with any war, there is an enormous amount of killing in this movie with severed heads and limbs being cut off with swords. The special effects are spectacular and please do not take your children to see this movie. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run time 1:57, Rated R)(10/10)",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"Visually stunning, painful to listen to","I think my title line sums it up. The whole movie was visually stunning, well done, blah blah blah, but the text was so clumsily and horribly delivered that it ruined the movie for me. I KNOW it's based on a comic book, and was pretty faithful to it, but couldn't they have made the spoken part of it a bit more natural? Does Gerard Butler not know that his mouth is crooked when he talks (in a role and in real life)? What about the lame, nondescript accents? I suspended my historical disbelief, realizing that it's more of a mythical/fantasy subject than historical, but could they not have delivered all aspects with the gorgeous conviction of the visual one?",,Anonymous,Action

"Very good for what it is, a comic book fantasy based on real events.","Zack Snyder's adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel 300 turned out to be an unexpected box office hit and was swarmed in controversy from the time it hit theatres. Obvious comparisons can be drawn to Robert Rodriguez's Sin City, also an adaptation of a Frank Miller comic book. Actors were shot in front of a blue screen for sixty days and backgrounds were CGI'ed in during a year of post-production to create a very dark and brooding atmosphere. Male characters are overly muscled in the comic book tradition and what few female characters there are are beautifully curved and scantily clad. Tough hard-boiled characters live and die by a dark philosophical code in the face of unspeakable evil.The plot line of 300 is taken from the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC where 300 Spartan soldiers and an additional number of some thousands of other Greeks (glossed over in this movie) led by Spartan King Leonidas held off an exponentially larger army of the Persian Empire led by Emporer Xerxes for several days before finally being surrounded leaving the 300 Spartans dead to the last man. The battle galvanized the Greeks into uniting as one nation and they ultimately repelled the Persians.The first twenty minutes or so detail the tough and disciplined upbringing made to mold Spartan boys into warriors which recalls Ridley Scott's Gladiator. Leonidas (Gerard Butler of Phantom of the Opera) is informed that Emporer Xerxes wants him to surrender without a fight by a Persian messenger. The messenger insults Leonidas's wife and is thrown into a bottomless pit. Leonidas consults an oracle who tells him Greece will be conquered or a Spartan king will die. There is nothing left to do, of course, but assemble 300 of the best Spartan warriors and fight to the death.The action gets underway pretty quickly after that and the carnage begins. The Spartans fight in helmets, brown Speedos, cavalry boots, red capes and nothing else. The Persian army looks very much like the human mercenaries who fought on the side of Sauren's army in Peter Jackson's The Return of the King. One of the Spartans is actually David Wenham who played Faramir in the Rings movies. Blood spatters, heads are chopped off, bodies get stacked up, limbs fly, and Leonidas gives Braveheartesque speeches about honor and glory and freedom in a Scottish accent. More and more fantastic elements are introduced as the battle wears on--giant rhinos and elephants, huge trolls chained until they are released to destroy, hand grenades(?), and one particularly nasty fellow with meat cleavers for arms. Xerxes (played by Rodrigo Santoro of Lost) is around eight feet tall, wears eye shadow and mascara, is laced with chains and body jewelry, and little else, and speaks in what must have been an electronically altered voice that is both effeminate and baritone at the same time.If the viewer is looking for historical accuracy this isn't it. Several of the speaking parts for Persians are played by Blacks, although Persia was what is now Iran and the Persian Empire never extended into Africa. Leonidas calls the Athenians ""Philosophers and boy-lovers"" but what really stopped the Persian advance was a sea battle fought by Athenians that sank most of the Persian navy. Quite often the 300 seems to be number around 50 in this movie, and the Persian army probably numbered around 300,000, not 2,000,000 as depicted here. The movie has been criticized by the latte liberal crowd as racist and homophobic; as well as celebrated by what is left of enthusiastic supporters of President Bush as a metaphor for the War on Terror: a few devoted REAL MEN defending white civilization against the barbaric brown-skinned horde while liberal surrender monkeys stab them in the back at home . Parallels could actually be drawn to Al Qaeda terrorists as well, with 300 depicting men raised since birth to take their own lives in a struggle against an evil foreign empire of infidels.Presumably Frank Miller had none of these geo-political concerns on his mind when he put pen to paper and wrote an 88-page comic book about the Battle of Thermopylae. And Zack Snyder probably didn't either when he decided to put it on the big screen. The big screen is the place to really enjoy what is essentially a good rip-snorting action-filled popcorn flick in the tradition of Roland Emmerich's Independence Day.

Done in a way that gives great credit to the imagination, 300 is a film that sees great acting on the part of everyone involved blended with awesome scenery and well executed battle sequences. The artistic aspect comes most notably in the depiction of the Persians, who come in all forms from beautiful to grotesque with all manner of piercings in the most unlikely of places.

"Come back WITH your shield, or ON it.","""300"" is a full-blooded, bloody war epic in which commanding Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) determines that he will go to war against invading Persian leader Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). This, despite the fact that Xerxes' army FAR outnumbers Leonidas' own. But, like Leonidas, his officers & soldiers are committed, passionate men who will do anything to defend their land. Back at home, Leonidas' wife Gorgo (Lena Headey) has to deal with a sleazy politician (Dominic West) while pleading to her council to give Leonidas more support.The first thing that really struck this viewer was how stylish this was: costumes, widescreen photography, production design, the thunderous music (by Tyler Bates), and even the digital gore. Its visual palette is limited in the number of colors it uses, but it really works, creating a convincing depiction of a graphic novel (by Frank Miller & Lynn Varley) come to life. The vigorous story utilizes themes such as honor, glory, and bravery, all personified in the characters of Leonidas and his followers. While hardly an intellectual tale, it's not the empty experience one might assume it to be either; I found it pretty entertaining myself, and not *just* a pretty picture.Butler is extremely forceful in the main role, receiving superb support from Headey, David Wenham (doubling as narrator), Vincent Regan, Michael Fassbender, Andrew Tiernan, Stephen McHattie, and Peter Mensah. Santoro is superb malevolent fun as the antagonist; Xerxes is an extremely arrogant sort who genuinely believes himself to be a god, and who desires more than anything that his opponents KNEEL before him.Due to its violence and otherwise graphic nature, ""300"" is not going to be to all tastes. But it delivers a fair amount of fun for people who enjoy this sort of thing.The same story was filmed previously in 1962 as ""The 300 Spartans"", with Richard Egan and Ralph Richardson.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Severely disappointed; flabby an unnecessary; weird obsession with mutants.  Also a goat headed person whose existence has yet to be explained,"It could have been great, but alas it was not so.So, first the good news: the visuals.Gerard Butler was perfect as Leonidas, the visuals were stunning and the fight scenes breathtaking. The look and feel of the movie was straight out of the graphic novel, assisted no end by Frank Miller's input. The crushed bronzes and crimson, the subdued lighting and the Gothic shadowplay all come together to add real depth to the action, which when it works is nothing short of jaw dropping. Admittedly, Snyder, overuses the 'slow motion' button, keeping one finger hovering over it, stopping and starting in a quest for every cooler visuals, which is a bit much - but all this aside, the man really knows how to make a fight look pretty. The soundtrack, too, is effective, with a raucous, serious theme throughout (thankfully avoiding the annoying 'wobbly voiced singing' of Troy/Gladiator/Kingdom of Heaven/whatever), keeping things ticking over nicely.Now, of course, the bad: everything else.For starters, the plight of Queen Gorgo of Sparta really doesn't interest, and the Token English Bad Guy thrown in there for her to overcome For The Greater Good is so ham-fisted that he may as well have 'bad news, honey' tattooed on his forehead. It feels tacked on, an obvious and shallow attempt to add depth to a movie which really doesn't need it, and I defy anyone to really say they cared when her conflict was resolved. Spartan high politics? Get back to the fight!Next, is the portrayal of the Persians. I'm normally quite bothered by films where they purport to display even handedness and historical accuracy but end up with an abomination, but I was willing to give this a wide berth. 300 isn't that kind of movie - it's about the essence of a story, told through a simple, moralistic viewpoint, and so despite being highly familiar with the period I wasn't about to start shouting about how wrong they got it. What I do care about is the undercurrent of racism that pervades this movie, much more so than that of the graphic novel. The Persians are portrayed as overly decadent, fawning cowards led by an androgynous, nine foot tall creature, all of whom are tellingly black or Asian. As if to heighten this weird display of Xenophobia, for some unknown reason, every anonymous footsoldier is horribly deformed - at one point the mask of a Persian Immortal is pulled back to see Freddy Kreuger's hotter brother: the untutored would think this were standard procedure, as the king's harem is also packed with scarred freaks and weirdos. Why this choice was made I do not know - it certainly does nothing to highlight the differences between Greek and alien, nor does it serve to illustrate what they stand to lose. Surely the fight that the Spartans fought for freedom was a weighty enough choice?This obsession with deformity continues through to Ephialtes the traitor - given a far less sympathetic look-in than in the original graphic novel. Whereas previously he was brave, strong and tragically cursed, here he is viewed as a whipped cur, a snivelling coward who in the end cannot meet Leonidas' eye. Stripped of his misplaced nobility, the depths of his fall from grace (such as it was), he now stands as a comedy character, an 'igor' from frankenstein.Lastly, and this is more significant than all of the other points, is David 'Faramir' Wenham's boring, weedy narration, which, I'm sorry, did nothing for himself or the movie. His voice lacked passion, pitched somewhere between 'learned scholar' and 'hardcore warrior' and missing both. This seriously prevented me from suspending my disbelief, and ultimately ruined the movie.A common theme of everyone I've spoken to who's seen this shambolic hulk of a movie is 'it looks spectacular but there's not much to it'. The consensus is that the film's flaws are compensated for by the film's looks: the question for most is whether the good points, of which there are many, can outweigh the bad, of which I believe there are many more. It didn't work for me - perhaps I was too familiar with the source, and the event itself. But if that's the best that can be said about a movie, any movie, then something seriously wrong has happened, and that the notion of style over substance is an all too damaging trend in modern cinema.Surely that's not a good sign?",3.0,Anonymous,Action

And i went into the cinema expecting less than nothing. But as soon as it starts, I'm completely wrong! I'm blown away! At first it stated very slow, with the narrator's voice...and I started to get a little bored, but that didn't last long. This movie makes me excited as hell with the fighting scene, the war and their strength and courage. It's is full of witty and funny quotes as well, despite it being a war movie and all. 300 rocks my world man! But to tell the truth, I was quite disappointed in the ending...but since it's the twist, then I just accepted it. I won't tell you what it is, as it will spoil everything. Just go and watch it! You won't be disappointed! But whatever the ending was, 300 Spartans is the Champions and wins in every possible way! Spartans are the greatest army of all time!!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Holy Special Effects Batman!,"I went to this movie last night, one of movies that I had filed away ""to see when I get around to it"". I loved it. I enjoyed LotR, especially the battle scenes, and this is like the LotR battle scenes... Except better! The special effects in this movie are spectacular! If you enjoyed the LotR battle scenes, then you will definitely enjoy this movie! Not for the faint of heart though, I enjoyed it, but a lot of my audience was yelling out ""ewww"" and ""yuck"" when things happened! This is a very good movie to go and see while you're in a very bad mood and just need some cheering up :) One that will make you think ""See? Things aren't SO bad! You could be dead, or worse yet, slaves!""",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Watch the History Channel Version.....,"This movie sucked. Frank Miller absolutely raped the histories with this depiction of the Battle of Thermopylae. First and foremost the Spartans NEVER left the Phalanx unless the **** hit the fan. Nor did they use their swords unless they absolutely had to. They wore armor too, they were not fighting nearly naked.Oh yeah and can't you just hear President Bush giving those speeches about democracy and freedom??? The concept of democracy was very much in its infancy at the time of the Battle of Thermopylae. Sparta was, for all intents and purposes, still a monarchy.My suggestion would be to read the Herodotus Histories or at least watch the History Channel version called The Last Stand of the 300. This is a far more accurate version of the events. It also gives you some background as well. It is very entertaining as well.",,Anonymous,Action
This movie involves a legendary,"The movie involves a legendary last stand by 300 death-obsessed Spartans against a teeming horde of Persians. So brave and strong are the Spartans that they skewer, eviscerate, behead and otherwise inconvenience tens of thousands of Persians before finally falling to the weight of overwhelming numbers. The lesson is that the Spartans are free, and the Persians are slaves, although the Spartan idea of freedom is not appetizing (children are beaten to toughen them).",6.0,Anonymous,Action
One of the best action and fantasy movie I've ever seen.,"July, 2006. I saw the trailer of this movie first time, and I was kicked by lightning. I had started to wait for the full version and I was excited what could the director of the Dawn of the Dead make from the Frank Miller comic. I watched it a week ago and I'm not sorry for that! It was fantastic as I waited! The fantasy motives didn't bother me it's not a historical film. Heroic battles, heroic war cries, comic-feeling like in Sin City, ""few against many""... everything I can like in a movie. OK, there were movie stock phrases in it, but is there anyone who can show me a movie from Hollywood in which there aren't any ""I have seen it before?""-motive? It's created a statue to the three hundred, who died 2500 years ago. Yes, don't forget, there are historical basics in 300 in spite of the fantasy monsters. There great ""job"" for the Greek culture comes to us by this movie and that's the thing that makes 300 more than a ""B action film"" I think. Okay, I can say like the haters of this film: there were too much action and battle in it at the middle of the film and the story disappeared a bit. But I could have understand the main story was the battle and the events were played at Thermophylai. The pictures were well constructed too, and they gave 300 a perfect comic style. We have a feeling that we're reading Frank Miller's fine writing!The only thing that was a stick in my eyes is the movie's end-game. It was too tragic and I didn't feel the heroism which was in the death of the 300 soldiers.So, I think 300 has become on of my favorite movies next to Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. If I have a chance I'll buy it on DVD and I'll watch it several times! XD",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"Well made, but ultimately hollow and disappointing","I really don't understand why this film is gathering so much praise, I admit that it's very competently made, the visuals are interesting and well done, but ultimately it's a completely hollow experience. The characters are two-dimensional and ridiculously silly, how can anyone possibly relate to this film? Maybe I'm missing the point, but I wasn't even particularly entertained by any of the action. Some of it, I admit, was fun, but for the most part I was all too aware of myself sitting in a dark room watching what are largely computer animated images. It just didn't suck me in, and I'm disappointed because I thought it would be much better considering all the rave reviews on here. Unfortunately, by the end, I was just slightly bored. I'm not denying that the film has merits, it's still well made for what it is, but at the end of the day this has no right to be in the top 250 and I felt I should just add my two cents seeing as some of my friends were also disappointed. This is a very average film with, in my opinion, nothing radically original or great about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
war/prestige/honour,was a journey to a beautiful creative entertainment.it was good to watch and know the life style of spartas.their history which was never told before in such a brief manner and explained totally.even though the movie dint have a great star cast who wold pull the audiences to the theaters it was great.instead i can say that it was the correct casing done and every actor had done justice to their own roles.he movie even though dint have a big story which needs to be told in 2hrs but because of the grip of the screen play the movie was made good.the director had more ideas which had been told i na better manner than the writer who had written the original novel.the hero's character was portrayed in a great manner.,10.0,Anonymous,Action
