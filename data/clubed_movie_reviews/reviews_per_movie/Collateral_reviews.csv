I'm in the minority about his 2 best performances,"People rave about Tom Cruise in other projects, but I'll say his best 2 for me are Born on the Fourth of July and this one.It isn't just about playing against type. It's about the difference between playing someone who's bad and just being bad. It's about authenticity. You see it in great actors.I'm new to this site but I've seen hundreds, if not thousands of films in my lifetime. He's one of the few modern movie actors who have this kind of star power. He's not as authentic (or instead of authentic I should say he sometimes looks like he's efforting his performance) in all of his performances as others (like a Spencer Tracy or Henry Fonda, for example), but when he's on...He's ON.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Taut thriller led by Cruise's excellent work.,"For the better part of his career, Tom Cruise has played the All-American good guy. Gleaming eyed and bushy tailed, Cruise has played the roll of the hero in many films and is certainly the richer for it.Something happened along the way, though. Cruise wanted to be considered a legitimate actor, rather than merely a ""movie star."" Therefore, we've seen him go against type, successfully (MAGNOLIA), and not so much (THE LAST SAMURAI). It's as if Cruise is the neglected kid in the back of the classroom who knows all of the answers but is never called upon, and therefore will go to desperate ends for attention. ""Oh, Oh!! Pick me!!! Pick me!!!""For me, Cruise hit it this time. His character in COLLATERAL is a menacing study in coldness. It is a thoroughly believable depiction of an utterly ruthless hit-man. It seems, finally, Cruise is actually BAD, rather than merely acting bad. He disdains his usual tricks in favor of a simple and very real performance.Let us not forget Jamie Foxx. His character's transformation into a hero is rendered all the more effective by how wonderfully Foxx captures his character's initial impotence and bewilderment. It's a wonderfully effective, energetic, and yet very subtle performance.Special kudos to Michael Mann. He has a very interesting eye when it comes to capturing the city of Los Angeles on film. His vision of L.A. in this film is one of unease and uncertainty, hardly the usual glitz and glamor treatment. This work is always compelling to the eye and paced to keep the action moving ever forward. Each scene has its own logic, contributing to the overall whole. This is first rate film-making.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Thriller and action with two top-notch actors : Cruise and Foxx,"The movie focuses on Max (Jamie Foxx), he is a cab driver from Los Angeles town . He makes his rounds at night dealing with various characters (Debi Mazar , Jada Pinkett Smith) in the car talking with them. Along the way, he dreams of have his own Limousinas company, though to his ill mummy (Imma P. Hall) tells her that he is already an owner . While Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a cruel killer with an engaging contract who offers a large sum of money to drive him through locations around L. A. Then, Max realizes he is a murderer who has been hired to kill a number of people . Events go wrong and Max becomes a hostage and he must find a way to rescue the last deadly objective. Meanwhile, Police Inspectors (Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg) are tracking down the nasty killer.The picture packs action, violence , drama , shootouts with exciting scenes. Casting is frankly excellent , the main protagonists give
first-class performances. Jamie Foxx (recently his Oscar for ¨Ray¨) as a hapless cab man is awesome similar to Tom Cruise as the relentless murderer , besides Jada Pinkett (Will Smith's wife) as obstinate prosecutor is magnificent and brief appearance by Javier Bardem . The film contains stimulating action set-pieces as the impressive gunplay developed in a tumultuous discotheque or the breathtaking final pursuit in the building and on the train . Atmospheric and moving musical score by the master James Newton Howard. Colorful and spectacular cinematography -although some dark due to be mainly shot by night- by two nice cameramen , Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron . The motion picture was well directed by the successful director Michael Mann (Red Dragon, Heat, Last Mohican , The insider) . The film will appeal to Tom Cruise devotees and action film enthusiasts .Rating : Better than average . Well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"constantly re-watchable with entertaining storytelling, a good serious neo-noir","Michael Mann's skills as storyteller, stylist, and controller of mood and psychology of characters is in one of its finest forms in Collateral, a summer blockbuster that's with equal measure of excitement and thought, dark humor and tough moments of violence and suspense. It's also one of only a handful of times in Tom Cruise's career where taking a chance dramatically with a complex character pays off. It's a 100 million dollar+ grossing movie, but its story could just as well be one set in the noirs of the 40s and 50s- a cabbie with some aspirations for his own business (and for a girl he picks up at the start of the film) gets taken over by a hit-man who's doing his rounds of murders all in one night. There's also cops on the trail, as well as FBI, but it's really more than anything about these two guys and the very stark, expected but still compelling climax. After the set-up gets underway, the film is as much character study as a typical crime thriller, and it's one of those splendid examples of style matching substance, where both contain some unconventional bits in what could have been a lesser film.Along with a good script by Stuart Beattie, and Mann's perfectly nuanced digital night-time photography (more suitable and exacting for the mood than the recent Miami Vice), there's the acting. First, of course, are the stars with Cruise in a turn-around role as the antagonist, who spouts out little bits of Darwin and I-Ching, but for the most part is a stone-cold sociopath. Cruise, wonderfully uncharacteristic for what he usually does in his star vehicles, is more low-key, ominous, and at the end quite dangerous. Jamie Foxx, too, in his real deserved Oscar-nominated turn, is also unconventional here as a common guy who's put between a rock and a hard place. Maybe his best scene, or at least the one I would show as him being a much better actor than he sometimes gets credit for, is when he has to meet Felix (Javier Bardem) to get a new 'list' of people for Vincent. That and a few other scenes are both tense and with an undercurrent of cynical, harsh humor that helps balance out the dark nature of the events.Collateral is also pretty re-watchable for a fan of this kind of picture, with a great score/soundtrack, great locations, and a couple of interesting ending images.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Coyote and a Shepherd,"Michael Mann's, ""Collateral,"" is similar in many ways to his crime classic, ""Heat."" ""Heat"" is a much better film overall because of the way Mann handles his two leads. Pacino and De Niro play the cop versus the bad guy. That's a great character study of a protagonist and an antagonist. He sets both men on opposite sides of the law and shows how similar they are and how different they are, and one wonders if their up bringing influenced their career paths. They both look and act as if they could switch places and be great at each others jobs. Mann keeps the two titans separated for the majority of the film with only two scenes shared together. ""Collateral"" brings these two guys, one good and one bad, together from the get- go. This is the driving force of the film and this is a necessity, but it also brings in several plot devices, coincidences, and moments were you might find yourself baffled by some of the reckless or stupid decisions made. Some audiences members will be tested to look past those moments for the moments of suspense, thrills and symbolism.Mann always does a great job of getting exceptional performances from multiple actors in his films and here is no different. Tom Cruise gives a nomination worthy performance. Mark Ruffalo gives the best performance of his less-than-stellar career. Javier Bardem has one scene and he hits it out of the park. Jamie Foxx is a personal favorite of Mann's, but he was miscast for this role. He was average in this role, and in order to make him look the part, they stuck some nerdy glasses on his face, and poof... he's a cab driver. Didn't quite work. He has his moments, but when he's on screen, Tom Cruise is on screen; Javier Bardem is on screen, and those two just hit their performances out of the park and he becomes a body taking up space. Cruise is excellent and surprisingly intense. Michael Mann seems to make films with great dialogue, but its the moments where he goes in close and uses extended shots of his actors eyes as they witness something powerful. Mann will set a scene in the quite or with growing background music, and let the actors emotions pour through their eyes and not a word will be said. The moment in ""Collateral"" comes when two coyotes run across the street. Vincent (Cruise) just gets done telling Max (Foxx) how his father died and how he would be beat him after he got drunk. This scene signifies Vincent's loneliness and the coyotes that travel in pairs hunt for other beings. Vincent is the coyote and he's looking for a partner to hunt to with. Since he has no one, he uses cab driver's. He attempts to connect with Max and profess his ideals on life, which changes Max' outlook on life. This is the changing moment of the film. This scene will lead to Max' change. He will then become the shepherd.Even though Mann uses plot devices and relies on coincidences, its the moments of symbolism and suspense and the thrilling nature of man hunting man that spark some moments that will make you think, or put you on the edge of your seat. Mann does an incredible job of building suspense. He does a great job of developing his characters. ""Collateral"" offers up some humor; some great acting; a great thriller, and a great lead performance. This is a flawed film and relies on things that can throw reality out of the window, which lessens Mann's direction, but his film accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's an exceptional film that gets better upon repeat viewings.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cruise control is outfoxxed!,"It is hard to lavish enough praise on the acting on display here from the two main protagonists. Jamie Foxx shows signs of the charisma and ability that made him a cert for the best actor Oscar for Ray. Meanwhile Tom Cruise is a sheer revelation as the psychotic but professional hit-man Vincent.Cabbie Max (Foxx) picks up Vincent (Cruise) expecting just another job. When Vincent offers to double his nightly earnings if he drives him all night he accepts, until Vincent's mission is revealed. What follows is a night of hell for Max, reluctantly driving Vincent from hit to hit, all the while trying to stay alive and do the right thing, two goals which may ultimately be unachievable together. What is most fascinating about Cruise's character though is the sheer indifference he shows towards his victims. He does not hate them, he doesn't even know them, he has just been assigned to kill them and does so with absolutely no remorse. When a body crashes on to his cab, followed by Vincent's re-appearance, Max is shocked by the answer to his accusatory 'you killed him!"" - No, I shot him, the bullets and the fall killed him."" This matter-of-fact approach is indicative of Vincent's professionalism, and adds a really chilling level of apathy to the character.It is certainly refreshing to see Cruise in such a different role, and it is one which he really gets his teeth into, producing a sociopath contract killer, seemingly with no remorse and no redeeming qualities. He pulls it off with a genuinely sinister edge on the character, and the final half hour is particularly impressive from an acting point of view.Jamie Foxx however is certainly by no means acted off the screen. His likable cabbie with relaxed attitude to life (well, until he meets Cruise) shows many of the qualities he used to really bring Ray Charles to life later.The action too is well staged by Michael Mann, in probably his best work since Heat. It is easy to track the action through the relatively simple plot, and the set piece scenes are competently done without being spectacular. A very good above average thriller, but most notable for Cruise's revelation of another string to his acting bow. A superbly acted film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Masterpiece,"Collateral is a masterpiece of American cinema. Jamie Foxx is Max, a Los Angeles cab driver with dreams of his own limo company, ""Island Limo"". After twelve years on the job he has become quite gifted at discerning the most intimate details of his passengers' lives... just a glance at their clothes, and he knows.His worldly insight manages to tear down the defenses of one of his passengers, a State Attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith, who graces him with her phone number. Max hasn't even begun to revel in the pleasure of possessing the beautiful attorney's digits when he gets his next passenger, Tom Cruise as Vincent, a slick hit-man in town for a night of killing.When a body drops out of a fourth story window and onto Max's cab, he becomes an unwilling partner on Vincent's murder spree. Director Michael Mann (The Insider, Ali) does a masterful job manipulating texture and tone throughout the movie, taking us to settings as diverse as a junkie's apartment, a penthouse, a hospital room, and a smoky jazz club, all the while making the city of angels a central character in the story.The soundtrack is also excellent, with a mixture of popular music and ambient tracks perfectly-timed and synced to the story... tribal drumbeats during the chase scenes, haunting rock ballads at pivotal moments, and one track that reminded this viewer of the scene at the other end of Tom Cruise's career, when he drives his father's Porsche out of the garage in ""Risky Business"" to the accompaniment of a thumping synth track. A bizarre side-note, I know.As the movie builds to a climax, the police are hunting for Max, believing he is the one on a killing spree, and Vincent stalks his final victim in a blacked-out high-rise office to a backdrop of the brilliant LA skyline, reflected in multiplicity by the office's dozens of glass cubicles.Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and Jada Pinkett Smith all rise to the occasion in Collateral, and together they transcend their previous appearances on film. Mark Ruffalo gives a good performance as the cop who knows everything is not what it seems.There are a few minor plot points which didn't sufficiently suspend my disbelief (like when Max agrees to take Vincent the vicious hit-man to see his Mother in the hospital), but overall this is a fantastic movie.Troy Dayton",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
With patience it is a very effective thriller whose plot problems are covered by a great director and a strong cast,"Max thinks his day is looking up when he gets a beautiful fare who gives him a tip and her business card when she gets out. Resting on his laurels, Max nearly misses his next fare; Vincent, in LA for just one night to close out 5 deals, get signatures and then fly out by 6am and he offers Max a few hundred dollars to taxi him around for the night and then drop him at the airport. Max agrees and takes him to the first stop, only to discover that Vincent's job is actually to kill a list of 5 people and, now that Max has witnessed one killing, Vincent has no choice but to keep him with him.I loved this film; there is no point in trying to hide that fact, but I am not blind to the problems that it has: too many reviewers have either loved it without exception or overly criticised it. The plot has holes  there, I've said it. The plot relies on some actions that don't ring true and other times rely on coincidences or just write things in to move the plot. However this is not a massive problem because it is still very enjoyable and gripping and its other strengths cover these problems. Of course, even with the holes it is still very enjoyable but demands your patience because, although it is tense, it isn't a roller coaster for the vast majority of the time. It has very fast moments but a lot of it is talky and patient  not a problem for me, but I can see why some multiplexers may have had itchy feet waiting for action. However even with this patience, the film is still very tense  helped by some very sudden moments of violence that come out of nowhere and help put the audience on edge. Much was made in Heat of key moments where opposite characters find common ground and in this film it is the opposite but done to similarly interesting effect. Here Max and Vincent are opposites who get under each others' skins over the course of the night; their relationship is very strange and I think the script does well to bring this across even if it is hard to understand at times (part of this is their relationship getting tied up in some of the plot weaknesses).A big part of the plot problems being covered is due to the strong direction from Mann, who can shoot a city like nobody else. As others have said, the fly-overs look great but for me the surprise was to see Mann add digital film to his cannon. This allows him to mix very rough, intimate shots with film to bring the audience in closer. I also noticed that he seemed to do very close angles and frames with 'proper' film as well, all increasing the feel of being 'there' and intimately involved. Of course, on top of this we still had Mann's usual shooting of LA at night  fluorescent lighting, empty streets and so on  nothing new but it is still very effective and great to look at. If it weren't for the very heavy cast involved here then Mann would be the main star of the film but, as it is, his direction is just part of the film pulling together to produce the goods.The cast is impressive and those who have come on the basis of Cruise alone will be surprised to find so many well known faces who are very able. Cruise wants an Oscar and he has done several of the Oscar tricks to get one  his most recent attempt here is to play totally against type. He does it pretty well, making for a convincing cold killer on the surface but still able to reveal an empty core when he is pushed. If he had been allowed to do this more then maybe he would have been more impressive but he isn't and the end result is just a good performance. Of course it doesn't help that Cruise has to play opposite Jamie Foxx delivering one of his most assured performances yet. Based on seeing him in stuff like Booty Call and his own comedy show, I was worried when I saw him due to star in this movie but it turns out that he can act! In fact he dominates the film with a quiet role that runs a gauntlet of emotions while Cruise mostly sits in 'cold killer' mode, meaning that, in most scenes, Foxx is the one we are watching. The support cast is surprisingly deep and the amount of familiar faces makes some moments of violence all the more unexpected. While none of them are really given the time to shine, there are quality turns from Smith, Berg, McGill, Hall, Henley and Ruffalo and it gives the (albeit false) impression of an all-star ensemble; although why Jason Stratham bothered to turn out for the one day of shooting he must have done for the airport scene is beyond me.Overall this is a very effective film. The atmosphere is just right and is helped by the script, the cast and the director  all combining to provide a patient pace that still manages to be very tense and exciting. Mann's direction is great, mixing film with digital to good effect and Cruise is very good playing against type with a good support cast of well-known faces.However the genuine surprise of the film is Jamie Foxx; better known for clichéd ethnic comedy roles, he steps up here and just about steals every scene he is in.",,Anonymous,Crime
Full night taxi service for an elegant Terminator,"Where there's Tom Cruise, there's an action movie!Collateral was introduced at me as a thriller story and I decided to watch it because the plot looked (and it definitely was) captivating: a taxi driver is held hostage by a peculiar hitman who is in charge of murdering 5 people during a common night in LA. Streets are empty, clubs are filled with people and the film also depicts the luxury of modern apartments and offices in the typical skyscrapers.The movie can be categorized in the action/thriller genre, even though I also really appreciated the comedy which was smartly inserted in some of the scenes.The figure of the hitman is impeccable: to me, Vincent is the representation of a sociopath killer, who is capable of always maintaining his lucidity and coldness, ready to react in every situation, totally extraneous from ethical principles and moral values such as compassion, respect and the value of human life.The character itself is not really well developed, in fact Vincent remains a mysterious figure, almost a machine (at some point he remembered me of Terminator, in his mechanical moves, his way of talking and his facial expressions) and we cannot really empathize with him.On the contrary, we get to know more about Max (the taxi driver) and this inevitably leads us to see everything from his point of view.Even though i'm not really a fan of action movies (they bore me to death because of their usual lack of plot and unrealisticness), Collateral succeeded at involving me for almost all of its duration and, although many events were narrated, I got to understand everything the movie wanted to communicate.It is obviously not a movie which stimulates deep reflections because of its genre, but i'd say it succeeded in its intent of capturing and maintaining viewer's attention.Very entertaining!Elements that would have made the movie more appealing to me: the deepening of the relationship of friendship between the two main characters, a rounder description of Vincent's character and the elimination of police investigations in the movie (they are a very common theme in action movies: useless policemen who chase the main characters).",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

It is well timed at crucial scenes and when the film is done, you just want to buy the soundtrack to listen to.Everyone that I have recommended this film to have been well pleased.

OK if you ignore gaping plot holes,"Rather contrived thriller. The most obvious difficulty is why a supposedly professional contract killer would go to the trouble of taking the cab driver hostage in the first place. Why not simply hire a car, change cabs between jobs, or try to do a better job of hiding what you were up to in the first place? As it is, Vincent (Tom Cruise) as the killer ends up with a very reluctant companion who he must know would try to foul things up for him. The only reason is to keep the two characters of the cab driver Max (Jamie Fox) and the killer together, which might make sense as a way of creating dramatic situations but stretches believability. However, if you can get past that, the very clichéd ending and numerous other plot holes, it's not too bad. I'll give it a 7/10 for sheer entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Collateral"":  Spotlight on Film Director Michael Mann","The best scene in Michael Mann's ""Collateral"" is a late-night conversation in a dowdy jazz club in Los Angeles. The conversation between Tom Cruise's hired killer Vincent and the club owner played by Barry Shabaka Henley is riveting, as the trumpet player recalls a chance meeting with the legendary Miles Davis. The scene is so realistic that it could have been lifted from Ken Burns' epic PBS series ""Jazz."" At the same time, director Mann brings to the scene the same powerful subtext achieved in his film ""Heat"" when Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro played out a memorable conversation across the table in a restaurant. The jazz scene in ""Collatoral"" was brilliantly written. But it was the careful set-ups, camera angles, and subtext of the performances that made for brilliant film-making.Beyond this memorable scene, there is an edgy undercurrent to nearly all of the conversations in ""Collateral,"" starting with the engaging scene in the cab between Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith. All of the performances in this film are outstanding, especially Foxx as the intelligent, underachieving cab driver. I especially admired how the director subtly conveyed within the psyche of Tom Cruise's contract killer a mystery about the character's past. There is a long scene where the hit-man Vincent tells a harrowing tale of family abuse when he was a child, then informs cabdriver Max that he was just kidding. But was he? There are many complexities to the characters effectively layered into the film by Mann.The stylish cinematography is another trademark of Mann's work. His choices in colors and lighting aesthetics are especially noteworthy in ""Collateral."" The location filming in Los Angeles, including the different nightclubs were memorable moments of the film. The unique stamp of Mann's style was apparent in an early film like ""Thief"" (1981), which was ahead of its time in film technique. In ""Collateral,"" the overall effect is that of a ""Naked City"" presented with brutal honesty.For all of its gritty realism, however, some of the action sequences, especially the climactic ""death"" scene, were surprisingly incredible. There are lengthy chase scenes on totally deserted streets in downtown Los Angeles. For anyone who has driven around L.A. at any time of the day or night, it would be difficult to imagine zipping around freeways and streets that look like those portrayed in this film. In the 60 years since the curfew imposed during the years of World War II, there have never been streets as empty in Los Angeles as those depicted in ""Collateral.""",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

No offense to him, but I found Cruise better. He was just outstanding in here as the immoral hit-man. Foxx was entertaining, too, as the nerd-ish cab driver who is pulled into Cruise's murdering adventures.You'll appreciate both of these guys, and the great visuals, more on the second viewing after you are familiar with the story.

Mann is still unable to end a movie strongly.,"---THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!!---Mann has made a very good movie, but, as many other reviewers have pointed out, the ending is clichéd and silly. His other movies share this problem. Inevitably, the protagonist survives and (usually) gets the girl.In order to make this happen, Mann has to invest Max with the most unlikely equanimity and a phenomenal natural skill with weapons. He also has to make Vincent, a practiced and well-trained hit-man, act like an idiot with suicidal urges.To be fair, this is really Stuart Beattie's fault. I guess he has been watching too many ""Die Hard"" movies. But I would have thought that Mann would have insisted on a little more reality (hmmmm...maybe I mean a more realistic unreal plot) and authenticity. This is even more mysterious because Mann had no problem killing off main characters and love interests in the ""Miami Vice"" series.I would have given this movie another star if Vincent had ultimately killed the prosecutor and then said something philosophical to Max before simply walking away. The evening and morning would simply bookend a night in which many characters enter Max's life, change it, and then disappear forever, leaving him a changed man.*** out of *****",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Yo homie, is that my briefcase?""","Collateral is a nearly flawless, action, fast paced thriller with superb acting. It is without a doubt one of the best films ever made.The acting by the film's 2 stars, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx is absolutely masterful. These 2 already phenomenal actors displayed an even higher notch of excellence in Collateral. Acting-wise, this is definitely one of the most indescribably amazing movies ever.The script is very simple, and could have been easily taken way too far, however, Michael Mann makes sure that the story is not overdone, and delivers a solid beginning, middle, and fabulous ending.I know I've already gone over the acting once, but Tom Cruise definitely deserves even more recognition. He plays a professional hit-man just the way it should be played, and more. A hit-man isn't like Rambo, a hit-man doesn't have 5 machine guns strapped to his back and over 50,000 rounds of ammunition. No, Tom Cruise displays a purely flawless performance about what a hit-man really is. A hit-man is supposed to be gentleman-like, and they are supposed to act as if they are going about their daily lives, even before a hit. Many people believe that Tom Cruise's character in the movie was mentally ill because of the way he seemed calm one minute and killed people the next, however he was doing nothing more than his job. It is almost like in a football game, if you are originally a nice person, and you step on the field, you become a killer. Tom Cruise, when doing his job, is a killer.

"Although Being Very Exaggerated, It is a Good Action Movie","In Los Angeles, the taxi driver Max (Jammie Foxx) is hired by a costumer, Vincent (Tom Cruise), who introduces himself as a Real State broker, to spend the night driving him to five different locations where his clients would be waiting for him. After the first trip, Max realizes that Vincent is indeed a hit-man. Along the night, the number of bodies in the morgue increases, and the police force and the FBI chase Vincent in the cab. ""Collateral"" is a good action movie, and one of the best with Tom Cruise. Jammie Foxx has a great performance as a support actor, in the role of a dreaming taxi driver. The problem with the story is very usual in these Hollywood blockbusters: the screenplay is very exaggerated and the viewer cannot think how plausible the situation is, otherwise he will not enjoy the film. For example, in one moment, there are police cars and helicopters chasing the taxi in LA streets. Suddenly, all this police apparatus vanishes, and the streets become desert. In the subway, there is a great shooting in the train. The conductor probably is deaf and cannot hear anything, since he never stops the train in a station or calls the police.

The basic plot revolves around Foxx as a cabbie who catches a stroke of bad luck by acquiring Cruise as a passenger. Cruise turns out to be a hit-man who is picking people off as his temporary employer sees fit. A wild ride through LA's nightlife gives way for a journey of self-realization for Foxx (whom dreams of his own limo company and tropical islands). The slick script and sophistication of the plot and character development always keep the audience on the edge of their seats.

Alfred Hitchcock would be proud.,"If Alfred Hitchcock were alive and making movies today,I firmly feel that they would look something like this excellent thriller from Michael Mann.Tom Cruise makes an excellent turn going against type as a hired killer.Also excellent are Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith in their supporting roles.It's very rare that you can compare any modern day thrillers with the likes of Hitchcock,but I feel safe in saying that he would give a thumbs up here.It has enough plot twists and turns to keep the audience on the edge,and again,Cruise does a great job of making us hate him,if only for a couple of hours.It's definitely worth the rental, and worth buying and placing with your Hitchcock favorites.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
very disappointing,"This film held my attention for about 20 minutes, then it was one absurdity after another; one convenient plot manipulation after another that caused me to lose any semblance of interest. First: no cabbie would have such total independence from the dispatcher - we hear from the dispatcher twice - the first time he gets chewed out by Cruise (yeah, like THAT is going to happen) and the second time to relay that Foxx's mother called. Absurd. Anyone that's been in a cab, much less DRIVEN one, would know that you just don't drive around L.A. all night without checking in or there would be hell to pay not to mention cops looking for you. Cabbies get robbed and/or killed all the time, their disappearance would not go undetected. Second: the body left in the trunk - did Cruise just sort of space out that teeny piece of evidence? Third: good thing a neutron bomb hit L.A. that night so there was no traffic hardly anywhere. Uh huh. It's so helpful that targets in dark, noisy clubs sit where there is bright white light on them so they can be seen clearly not to mention the ease with which our main characters get away in the midst of the (eventual) chaos as the club empties out; the coyotes/wolves crossing the street, the subsequent awful musical interlude, the pseudo-psychological banter between killer and driver were enough to make me roll my eyes. ...And the list just goes on and on. This is not an adult thriller unless you're on meds that dull the senses. This is a mess of a film in spite of the acting being good -- the writing is just sloppy. There is nothing here that Hitchcock would appreciate, as some would assert. Hitchcock had plot conveniences and ""coincidences"" that would seem implausible, but in the hands of a Master, they were pulled off...not here, though. This is a good example of American cinema: ""people don't want anything serious to think about, they just want to be entertained for a couple of hours"".Rent this if you must, but for me, it is 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fantastic in every aspect,"Everything you could want from an action/thriller. An intriguing and original story, crackling dialogue, fantastic performances, superb direction, and some great action set pieces. The film is just all-around excellent. Cruise and Foxx have great chemistry and play off each other well, and the supporting characters add to the story without taking away from the two leads. The cinematography is simply stunning, and is showcased to full effect in the film's highlight, the nightclub scene. The end goes off the rails a bit, but it's simply an extension of what had been building the entire film. And the ending, though abrupt, is perfect for the film. Just a fantastic film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Enlivened by on-target star performances.,"Working from an intriguing screenplay by Stuart Beattie, producer / director Michael Mann offers up a crime thriller with a nice twist, with a dazzling array of Los Angeles locations and cityscapes serving as the backdrop, all of it very well shot by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron in a hi-def digital format. Tom Cruise plays Vincent, a hit-man from out of town called in to eliminate a quintet of characters. He has easygoing cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx) drive him around, and forces him to become an unwilling ""partner"" when things start going wrong. And this is where ""Collateral"" is the strongest, at portraying this antagonistic and yet compelling relationship. As we will see, Vincent is very cold blooded and ruthless when it comes to his trade, but at many turns he works at understanding his new acquaintance and trying to manipulate his life. Try as he might, Max has a very hard time breaking free from this sociopathic creep; they're pretty much bound together for a long and eventful night. This is also that refreshing variety of genre picture where the action supplements the story rather than the other way around. There are some pretty brutal and visceral scenes, but they never take over. The only time that the film ceases to be less than satisfying is when it turns conventional for its last act, turning Max into a hero all alone in his struggle with the bad guy. Still, it's worth noting that Max is not a hero from the beginning: his resolve has to grow as initially he feels impotent and useless. Vincent is also able to see through Max and realize that the cabbie's big dreams of starting up a limousine company may never come to fruition. After all, he may claim his taxi driving job is temporary, but he has been doing it for a dozen years...Foxx's performance is believable, and one is able to sympathize with him. The real surprise here is Cruise, who completely inhabits the role of the killer. You can actually forget you're watching a Cruise performance here; he's that good. The strong supporting cast includes Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Bruce McGill, Irma P. Hall, and Barry Shabaka Henley, with Javier Bardem contributing a riveting, memorable cameo as a crime lord and Jason Statham appearing fleetingly at the start of the story. In addition, Mann turns the city of L.A. into something of a character itself, taking full advantage of many of its locations. Overall, this is a good, solid diversion, one that really does keep one watching and interested to see how things will develop. It begins in a calm, deliberate fashion, but the tension is soon wound up and the story moves forward faster and faster. Well worth watching for fans of the stars and the director.

I read the premise of the story and watched the trailer, and based on that I thought the concept was pretty interesting. But goddamn the dialogue and the characters are so well put together. How some of the dialogues are written is so amazing. The music also creates vibes that immersed me even more in the story.

It's very good movie,"The film demonstrates high-quality production, occasionally evoking a sense of tension.

A tad boring movie with a silly ending. What's all the fuss about?,"Cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx) finds himself caught with psychopath-hit-man Vincent (Tom Cruise) in his taxi on a night with murder in the air...Vincent is doing his thing with a couple of witnesses of some sort of crime (I forget what it was), and his last stop is procecutor Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith). Now it's up to Max to stop that.Not really an amazing storyline, and to be honest, not really a special movie in any way. Foxx is pretty convincing in his role, but Cruise is nothing special and the ending is rather strange and silly. It's almost laughable when Cruise does his Terminator/Matrix thing on the subway...Movie has some compelling moments (the scene in the nightclub comes to mind) but is surely not the instant classic some people mistake it for. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A-list stars, Z-grade movie","America's film critics have finally succumbed to madness. Collateral enjoys a healthy 85% approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes site, yet it is easily one of the ten worst films that I have ever seen. I'll grant you that the average moviegoer will probably not hate it as much as I do - nobody goes to a modern thriller expecting a masterpiece - but I think it's fair to say that many discriminating viewers will find this film trite, instantly forgettable and deeply disappointing. Worse yet: it's boring.Beware, for some minor (and hopefully vague) spoilers follow. I need to give away some of the plot in order to convey just how inane this movie is. I'm sure you already know that Jamie Foxx plays a cab driver who picks up a hit-man played by Tom Cruise. Foxx is placed in the unenviable position of ferrying Cruise around the city, watching helplessly as his passenger bumps off key witnesses in a major trial.Think about this plot for just a second, and a host of potential problems will rear their ugly heads. Surely, Cruise will have to kill Foxx at the end of the night - otherwise, Foxx will go to the cops and spill his guts. Yet Foxx doesn't seem to realize this. For the first half of the film, he goes along with everything Cruise says, putting up only a frustratingly wimpy front of resistance. His character is so clueless that he actually visits his mother with Cruise in tow, not realizing what everyone in the audience knows; Cruise only wants to meet mom so he can hold the threat of her death over Foxx's head.Though Cruise runs rings around Foxx for quite a while, our hapless cab driver actually has about five or six great chances to escape, all of which are squandered. He fails to give Cruise the slip in a hospital, in a bar, and in a crowded nightclub. Cruise threatens to shoot innocent bystanders, but since he's already killing people, surely it behooves Foxx to make an escape attempt anyway? Of course, Foxx does panic and flee at one point - and, within seconds, runs from a crowded area into a completely deserted one. Like you would, under those circumstances.Why is Foxx so scared of Cruise? Maybe because the hit-man is virtually indestructible. He shrugs off injures from car crashes and bullet wounds to the neck, soaking up damage like the Terminator and springing back to life every time he apparently dies. At one point, Cruise actually takes on a whole squad of cops and bodyguards in a packed dance cluband kills them all. Never mind that there are dozens of people around, and all anyone really has to do is grab him. I mean, come on - since when does one hit-man take on an entire crowd? Aren't assassins supposed to be subtle? Credibility is stretched so far that, even by Hollywood standards, the movie is goddamn absurd. Naturally, Cruise has to inexplicably wimp out in time for his final battle with Foxx, because we can't have the evil guy winning, can we?If only the action was the only lame part. Alas, the screenwriters pour salt into the wound by veering into 'philosophical' territory. Cruise waxes on about his abusive father (is this supposed to make him sympathetic?) and gives Foxx a tedious series of 'seize the day' speeches about following your dream - recycled, no doubt, from the equally annoying scripts of Fight Club and Dead Poets Society. Hollywood writers would have you believe that, if you just apply yourself, you can go from convenience store clerk or penniless cabby to successful entrepreneur in a matter of weeks. All you need is an eloquent bad guy to give you a boot in the a**! Any moment now, I expect Doctor Doom to come crashing through the wall and give me an inspirational speech about cultivating my writing talents. Or not.Shameful! It's just shameful. There's not a line or a scene in this movie that hasn't been lifted from another source and put through the trivializing machine. There's even a subway chase that feebly echoes The French Connection. The horror...the horror...Time to shut up now. You know how it is with bad movies; there's so much to complain about that it's tempting to overindulge in the smorgasbord of sarcasm. Incidentally, the increasingly silly Roger Ebert gave this three and a half stars - the same rating he gave The Shawshank Redemption...",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Flawed but memorable,"Despite the overall high rating, a lot of people here have relegated this movie to the killing floor. I must admit that I agree with most of their points. However, I came out on the other side of the equation.Let's start with the bad points. The film's integrity is just plain killed by sheer disbelief and unfortunately, it takes ""Collateral"" out of the great movie category. Early on, we have Jada Pinkett's attorney hitting on the cab driver, which is absolutely silly, though the connection is tied together later. The premise of Cruise (doing hits of another kind) riding around in a cab with a cab driver hostage could have been great, but it's carried out in such an over-the-top manner that it strains the limits of credulity. In general, it's the film's attempt to integrate subtle character development with the over-the-top body count that weakens the overall structure and causes it to devolve at times into total dumbness.But, these points aside, let's talk about the good aspects of the film. This is an interesting take on the old film noir style using indirect angle shots, shadows, and blurred lighting to create an effect similar to ""Night and the City"" by Jules Dassin. The soundtrack is a brilliant melange of grooves. Tom Cruise's performance is quite good, as is Javier Bardem in a brief spot. The interplay between Cruise and Foxx is arresting and accelerates to a compelling conclusion.To me, the question is ultimately - ""how did it play?"" I found myself thinking about the movie for some time after its conclusion, and it's that indelible impression that's worth a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sights & Sounds Great!,"Simply beautiful to look at  the cinematography and Jada Pinkett-Smith. The soundtrack to this film  although stunningly understated  was sublime. The pace could be misinterpreted as sluggish, I however applaud the uncompromisingly 'un-Hollywood' rhythm Collateral has from start to finish.'Action hungry' punters might feel a little short changed with this offering, because although it does provide beautifully executed battles  chiefly in the nightclub  Collateral is essentially a film that gravitates around the interplay between the two leads, near perfect visual sequences and a soundtrack that at times sounds angelic.My few snipes with this film are minor, yet worth mentioning if only to ask why such things were left in1. Vincent's trousers need lengthening  not a good look wardrobe guys! 2. NONE of the actors can run properly, although watching Foxx try to run offered me a huge slice of amusement and dramatic relief. 3. The only fight scene  fleeting though it was - between Foxx and Cruise looked ridiculousalmost comical. I expected to see an action bubble saying ""POW"" or ""KABAM!"". 4. As the film hurtles towards its culmination in the offices, Cruise suddenly adopts a Jason Vorhees-esquire approach towards his body posture, mannerisms and movementit just seemed a little odd to me. 5. The final scene  as the tube descends into the night - looked like the editor didn't quite know how to end the film smoothly, so didn't bother trying. 6. Plus, I didn't quite know if Cruise died in the end or was simply taking a napI just hope he didn't miss his stop, is anything more annoying?Aside from all these downers, I thoroughly loved so many things about this film, and wish more Hollywood films would adopt a similar laid back approach to future thrillers.Stunning!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Hold Tom Cruise as collateral until you get your money back,"This is one of the worst movies in a long time. The plot is absolutely ridiculous. It will have you screaming at the way the characters behave. Tom Cruise is a hit man who comes to LA to bump off 4 victims in one night. He hires Jamie Foxx's cab to drive him around. The first victim falls out of a window onto the cab. Incredibly, Foxx allows himself to help Cruise put the corpse in the trunk and then, more incredibly, allows himself to drive Cruise around for the rest of the night as Cruise bumps off his next victims. Along the way there are coincidences such as Foxx, Cruise and a cop investigating being in the same elevator and a female attorney who happens to get into Foxx's cab just before Cruise does. The script was written by people who think the audience is full of idiots and will actually accept characters behaving so stupidly. The fact that Foxx helps Cruise along the way is ridiculous and makes him a totally unsympathetic character. After Cruise has murdered 3 people, they actually have the gall to have Cruise and Foxx sit in the cab and talk personally. Maybe this is supposed to be a comedy. If so, it isn't funny. Unless the moronic screenwriters think a hit man is funny.Jamie Foxx is a good actor and doesn't deserve to be in a totally ridiculous piece of drivel such as this.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Superb, High Energy Thriller","I remember when this was released, watching the trailers on TV and thinking that it might be interesting.

Max (Foxx) doesn't have a clue but soon a body falls from a window, right on top of the cab. Now Max is in the hands of Cruise's killer. He is forced to drive him around as he commits his atrocities. Soon Smith's character reappears as one of Cruise's targets. Max tries to warn her, she is slow, and soon they are running for their lives (by the way, it seems she should have lost the high heels at some point.

By design, the film is both a character study and a typical crime thriller in perfectly nuanced and high-quality images. But first and foremost here are the stars who carry the film.

"""Collateral"" Is A Human Thriller, A Cold-Toned Noir and A Moralistic Character Study All Rolled Into One","Director Michael Mann has many trademarks, most notably his use of colours, particularly blue. He also has a knack for making ""bad guys"" deal with their own personal anguish; hypothetically speaking when this is rolled together with the previously mentioned trademark Mann creates a vividly calming and transfixing image of a character's personal struggle. This is just proof that Michael Mann is one of the most innovative directors working in modern American cinema.Max (played by Jamie Foxx) is a somewhat melancholy L.A. cab driver, a kind-hearted man who just wants to make some money and be able to offer his customers a smooth cabbie service. One night he picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise) who at first strikes the viewer as a mysterious businessman. Yet it quickly becomes apparent that he is actually a professional contract-killer. Max becomes the forced driver for Vincent and Vincent's psychopathic tendencies become more evident and cold-hearted as the film moves on.The film holds some of the finest cinematography modern cinema has to offer, it is so vibrant and vigorous in style that it is impossible to keep you eyes off the screen. The beauty of it is how entrancing it is, blending both illusive misconceptions and realistic character-driven drama. The film is strongly presented by its bold ""digital camera"" affect, creating a believable atmosphere and emphasising the feeling of a drawn-out night. It is also apparent that the film has shades of noir etched onto the surface, creating a convincing vision of the viewer becoming a passenger in the cab. Collateral captures lighting perfectly, ranging from illuminating car headlights to the wide-stretching street lamps. There is such a fantastic amount of range to the camera work, which differentiates between close-contact shots, which focus on the emotions of the characters to overhead shots scraping the sprawling L.A. night. The editing is another strong area of the film. It is extremely slick and cut with razor-sharp elegance, plus the edition of some wonderfully fitting music. There is something very natural about the technical side of Collateral, reinforcing Mann's ""auteur"" ability and perceptive vision of Hollywood's crime genre.The acting is dealt with a great enthusiasm and it is a shame the actors are working with what is a generally uneven script. Yet actors Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise overcome the obstacle by delving inside their characters and both being cast as characters which are unusual to some of their other career choices. Both prove to have strong versatility, dealing with their characters emotions and personality with a simplistic ease and helping to move the film along at a respectable pace. Both actors add a consistent amount of dimension to their roles, helping the film to become a character-study and letting the viewer perceive their own view of the events taking place.When revisiting Collateral I find it truly terrifying to how fast technology is moving in today's world. This may sound strange, but a lot of the technology in Collateral has already advanced leaps and bounds in the case of a few years. It is scary just how quickly our world is moving and how technology is a key part in most of our lives. Ironically, there is a scene in the film whereby Vincent expresses his formality on how short a person's life is. So is this an intentional example of subtext in the film, attempting conveying the speed in which the world goes by? It is questionable when you take into context how Collateral is a film which runs at an exceedingly fast pace due to its consistent level of thrills and capturing how fast time goes under stress. It is a shame that there are some flaws in the narrative, script and acting (from the extra cast members) because they sadly stop the film from gaining a true ""masterpiece"" status.Collateral is Michael Mann on top-form, it is the different ""cop vs. killer"" story, one which goes against the expected formulaic pattern and so succeeds in creating what is a meticulous tour de force in modern film-making. Collateral is a film not to be missed and certainly comes close to being mentioned alongside some of Mann's superlative achievements.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Existentialism, the Michael Mann way","This goes down as my second favorite film of 2004 (next to Kill Bill vol.2). But how can a basic premise of a film from a pulp style script be so invigorating and intense. This is achieved by it being raised up with the tork of Michael Mann. It seems to be you can't underestimate the guy who pretty much reinvented the crime narrative even when he went away for two semi-political/social conscious films like ALI and THE INSIDER. All that is achieved here is done by the method taken to tell the story.The plot is a cab driver Max,Jamie Fox, is forced at gunpoint to be the escort for a professional killer Vincint, Tom Cruise. It is such a simple tag line that you spin your head around from that tag with the suspicion that it sounds so simple it could be easily screwed up. It isn't. It is elevated to a height that we rarely see in a genre film. A thriller where the would be innocent man is forced against his will to do bad things. But it's given quite a spark. Just like the kind of spark that Christopher Nolan gave to the revenge film when he made MEMENTO.The presence of existentialism is what drives this home. We have Max, a man lulled by the rhythms of everyday routine, and Vincent, who somewhere lost his heart or was never given one. In this particular evening that the story covers they gain consciousness that the world around them demands something of them. They even start to understand that all along the world has been expecting things and tonight is the time to pay up. Freedom of choice is now more important than every when it comes to taking a life and saving a life. Consequence is promised around every L.A. concrete street corner.Mann makes this film continuing his ongoing theme which is that his men are always searching to find their identities through their professions. In just about every case the men have to go beyond the guidelines of their jobs to make their life altering decisions.I could be looking too hard into this. You could say that this is a film with conversation between good vs. evil, but Mann doesn't make it that easy. It is evident in Vincents look and attire. It is no coincidence that he is dressed in Grey and wears both a Grey beard and Grey head of hair. He is the Grey area, with both good and evil bleeding in. Just like Russell Crowe in THE INSIDER, or De Niro in HEAT, and William Petersen in MANHUNTER. We both agree and disagree with all of these characters. This constant bickering makes me want to watch again and again.Some have complained about the cat and mouse type chase of the third act of this film. There should be no argument with this. It is, again, consistent with Mann's theme of Cat and Mouse. Just like Graham the FBI agent vs. the Red Dragon in Manhunter, or the cop Pacino vs. the thief De Niro in Heat, Crowe's scientist vs. the Tabacco Industry in THE INSIDER. All Mann has done is keep Max and Vincent bottled up in the taxi cab for nearly 2/3 of the film and then let them go, which is the only natural progression of the story.The last great character in the film is Los Angeles. I don't think anyone else can film it like Michael Mann. It breathes, it pulsates-one could argue it is the driving force that makes Max and Vincent collide.Michael Mann has added to his collage of strong character study, with demanding visuals and unending arguments.

What is it with Mann and endings?,"I saw this film tonight, at the theater. It started out pretty good, with some good dialog, some nice-looking cinematography, some good acting and some surprisingly good character development for a film directed by Michael Mann(who did Heat, which is probably the slowest moving action film that I have seen and didn't hate). Then it slowly degenerated into a typical pointless Hollywood action flick, and by the time the ending came, I was almost sure it couldn't really sink lower whilst still being so stylish... then the ending came, and it did. What is it with Mann and endings? Heat had a really anticlimactic ending as well. The film just lost any point, apart from its theme/morale, which I suppose is good enough. The plot is decent, but riddled with holes and clichés(the cop who just ""knows that something else is happening here..."", the stupidity of the FBI/cops) and is often poorly paced. There were also quite a few scenes that didn't seem to make any sense, but were there to show L.A. at night(which Mann seems to love) and take up time. The acting is good enough, with a few exceptions that were great... Cruise makes a great villain, Foxx a less great hero. The character are pretty much clichés and stereotypes. The villain had no redeeming qualities, but was just easy to hate. The film is stylish, and I kind of like how it(at least early on) dodges the usual ways of setting up major action scenes, and instead lets the viewer relax, sets up a scene that allows some for some nice comic relief and character development, and then let things go to hell suddenly. The humor is(apart from just surprising, considering that it's a Mann film) pretty good, natural, and not forced. Cruise and Foxx have a pretty good chemistry, and some good exchanges of dialog. Not much else to say... a fairly good film that could have been much better. I recommend it to fans of the actors and of Mann's directing style. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Unstoppable,"Collateral is a very unique action-thriller movie which I personally enjoy seeing it. It has a great cast starring Tom Cruise as Vincent, the cold-blooded hit man out to do his job and Jamie Foxx as Max the reluctant cab driver with big dreams. When both men meet each other, their lives are no longer the same on that particular night as they have to survive a game of cat and mouse while law enforcement officers and a dangerous drug cartel are tracking them. Vincent is doing all the killings and Max has to drive him all over L.A. without resisting him as he's the hostage. I really liked the plot in this film which gives viewers the opportunity to interpret and analyze the characters of Vincent and Max who show a lot of depth. Among all the action movies, Collateral is on the top of my list.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Music in the Jazz Club,"I'm a big fan of Miles Davis and i did enjoy this film, but the music they were playing in the film that was supposed to be the band was taken straight from Miles Davis ""Bitches Brew."" Just wondering if anybody else noticed? Jamie Foxx was the best I've ever seen him! It was nice to see Cruise make a departure from his normal rolls. Even though this film seemed predictable, I was still really entertained by it. I don't think Michael Mann has ever made a bad film and this is no exception. I hope Tom Cruise will stray from the norm a little bit more. When he is not talking Scientology and he keeps his mouth shut, he can be fun to watch.However, Mark Ruffalo may be a better actor and he really shows his versatility in this film as well.-",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

It would be nice to see him take on more roles where he's not the squeaky clean guy.I think other than Born On The Fourth of July, this is Tom at his best. There were moments in the film, when he didn't speak a word, but his facial expressions said it all.

A complete waste of your time,"This movie is a contrivance from the word go that doesn't even try to end up at a destination of any meaning.Two hours spent with Tom Cruise the psychopathic hit man of immeasurable skill who is killed in the end by his freaked out cab driver with no skill and no balls.This flick barely stays together through the first half, the setup and killing of the jazz trumpeter in his club after hours being sketchy at best, but then the movie takes a dive after the FBI catches on as the bodies pile up, and Cruise then goes into a Chinese disco in Los Angeles to take out his fourth victim (an informant against Mexican drug dealers it would seem). There is no one on this planet who could lucidly explain even half of what transpires inside the club as Cruise shoves his way through the elbow-to-elbow crowded dance floor while appearing to be able to recognize every FBI agent inside and kill most of them even though you the viewer can't tell who is who nor imagine how anyone else could.After exiting the club and reclaiming his cab driver outside by killing the LAPD detective who the cabbie thinks has rescued him from the evil Cruise, the cabbie freaks out and flips the cab. Cruise exits and runs off to make his next kill while the dazed and confused Cabbie is first helped by a cop then arrested when the cop discovers the body of Cruise's first victim in the open trunk.But, as the cuffs are going on the cabbie, he peers into the back seat and sees the open laptop screen on which Cruise has the address and pictures of his victims. The final one is there and it is the attractive U.S. Attorney who the cabbie scored a date with just before Cruise got into his cab and began the nightmare hours earlier.Now, besides the cabbie being dazed to near unconsciousness, the laptop is a good six feet away from him and the picture of his fantasy date is about two inches squareEven an alert eagle would have trouble seeing that.The cabbie then fights off the cop, handcuffs him and takes off running with his gun to stop Tom Cruise from making his final kill of the evening.You know how that comes out. Even the morons who this movie was apparently made for can figure that out.Now why would Cruise be trying to kill the U.S. Attorney doing the prosecution? The sophisticated gang who hired Cruise (who appear to operate at a level beyond the Mexican government) couldn't figure out that the Federal government has more prosecutors?It's amazing that this kind of money could be spent and a director like Michael Mann would be involved with a flick that had a script this lame. Every cast member and plot turn in this movie is as hollow as Tom Cruise's hit man psychopathic character.You were warned.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Captivated by the story and the photography,"This is an impressive movie that took some risks and succeeded with them. In the technical aspect, the digital photography gave me a strange feeling of being part of the movie, a feeling that I don't get with 3D, IMAX or other formats.The story is very complete, no plot holes in it, but it has many subtle points that may be missed; the viewer has to pay attention to every detail. The problem is that these details build a house of cards in the minds of the audience: one missed point and the whole plot losses all sense, to the point of being ridiculous.The other problem of the movie is that although the end is very poetic and well done, with great photography and acting, it feels a bit empty; there is no police or FBI to take over from there. The ending could have been improved with just 20 seconds of footage of the authorities asking questions in a crime scene.In conclusion, this movie is great but it requires effort from the audience to be properly understood.

Effective thriller,"Jamie Fox is Max, an ordinary cab driver with dreams and aspirations of starting a business,one night he finds himself the hostage of a contract killer,Vincent, portrayed by Tom Cruise.Vincent forces Max to drive him around while he kills the targets on his list one by one.Meanwhile Detective Fanning(Mark Ruffalo) is investigating the death of one of his informants.Later Max he's able to escape only to find out that Vincent's last victim is a female client(Jada Pinkett Smith) that Max drove hours later.This thriller/film-noir that takes place in Los Angeles will captivate you from the early beginning.The plot is very interesting and the pace is great.The main theme is probably the clash of ideas and lifestyles between the two main characters; while Max waits for things to happen,Vincent forces them to happen,while Max has a perfectly sheduled routine,Vincent never knows where he's going to be in the next ten minutes.Tom Cruise's performance was perfect and you can't help but love Vincent even him being a sociopath.I think the Oscar nomination should had gone to him and not to Jamie Fox.Don't get me wrong, Fox did a good job but he was definitely out shadowed by Cruise's brilliance.Javier Bardem makes a small cameo so pay attention to that. In my opinion Collateral is Michael Mann's best movie and one of the finest thrillers in the last decade. 8.5/10",,Anonymous,Crime

One of the best crime thriller's ever,"Action films I'm always hesitant to see due to the fact that they can't balance out the story and the big sweeping action sequences in it.(Transformers and it's sequel comes to mind.) But now I've finally found another film, besides Die Hard, that perfectly balances story, action, and character development to the point of absolute perfection.I first heard of Collateral when it was recommended to me by a friend, seeing as none of my friends have good taste in films I wanted to pass it up. Well I'm now happy to say I'm glad I didn't. It was everything that action films today should be: taunt, suspenseful, extraordinarily smart, well thought out. Need I continue? Michael Mann(Who is the man! no pun intended. ) Crafts an ingenious little machine that creeps along at first very slow and then kicks it into full gear to blow your minds out in the end. It's bold and refreshing and is something amazing to watch unfold on screen as the cat and dog fight between Cruise and Foxx heats up. But none the less this is a brilliant film that is an amazing visual treat for the eyes and the senses.Tom Cruise(who gives another staggering and mind blowing performance.) plays a hit man like you've never seen before, he plays one with a conscience it is something truly amazing and breath taking to watch the way his character works on screen the ruthless way he kills without a seconds hesitation and then out of nowhere show's emotion for one of his kills, it's amazing and something to admire. Jamie Foxx(Who also delivers a fantastic performance here.) plays the cabby who has to drive around Cruise's character while he systematically whacks people. Foxx's performance is crucial and is in many ways, a contrast to Cruise's character and the way they almost become friends in a weird way is another fascinating thing to watch play out on screen. But all in all the two main leads and the rest of the cast hold up sturdy and strong in this brilliant film.Collateral is very complex in the way it portrays the relationship of the two main character's is played out so beautifully. The whole film is beautiful it's an amazing and monumental achievement in film making and is one of Cruise's and Foxx's best films to date. It's great fun to watch and see unfold in front of you and is shocking and heart breaking at the same time. All in all this is one hit you want to be in on.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
great performances in Michael Mann thriller,"L.A. cabbie Max Durocher (Jamie Foxx) has a conversation with his fare U.S. Justice Department prosecutor Annie Farrell (Jada Pinkett Smith). He wants to start a fun limo service and she's concerned that she's unprepared for her case. They strike up a connection.

He kidnaps Max making him drive. LAPD detective Ray Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) finds the crime scene of his CI and starts putting the pieces together.Director Michael Mann creates a stripped down thriller. Both Foxx and Cruise excel. Cruise is especially great as a cold-hearted killer. I do have questions about the movie. Why does Vincent need a cab? Why wouldn't he just kill Max and stuff him in the trunk? Why doesn't Max escape when he gets the chance? These and other questions are better off left behind. I choose to believe that Vincent kept Max for more than his GPS abilities. I choose to believe that Vincent is lonely and finds Max to be a fun plaything. It's better to simply enjoy this slick Michael Mann production.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Suspenseful and often well-crafted, but far too long","Heat-director Michael Mann delivers a fairly thrilling but uneven action-thriller. I enjoyed the first half but I gradually lost interest  this is perhaps strange since the second half was by far more action-packed than the first. However something about it just made it more generic and less exciting. This is also true for the whole film; some parts and generic while some are truly gripping.Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise are both great in their respective parts, Foxx as a cab driver leading a mundane life driving nights in L.A. and Cruise as the contract killer hitching a fare in his taxi to do his dirty work all around town. In spite of having a reasonably grounded and plausible storyline, Collateral occasionally features events and developments that feel altogether unbelievable. Max the cab driver (Jamie Foxx), for instance, picks up on his hit-man ways quickly and seemingly effortlessly whenever it calls for it. But the experienced professional hit-man Vincent (Tom Cruise) has a lot of trouble even shooting straight and covering up tracks.The philosophical ideas that are put forward in the film (by forcing them into conversation during the cab fare) are meant to add more depth to the story, but in truth, end up as pretty bland and well-milked observations. For example, Vincent frequently talks about how people are insignificant and about a dead man on the subway going six laps before anybody notices him. ""Get with it. Millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars, in a speck on one in a blink. That's us, lost in space. The cop, you, me... Who notices?"" He is, of course, trying to justify his killing.I would like to give Collateral 6.9/10, because it IS actually a well-crafted thriller... but since you can't rate in decimals, and I am reluctant to giving it a 7, this will only get 6/10. Sorry, Mann - not your best film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tom Cruises Best Film,"Actually not only Tom Cruises best film but also Michael Mann's. Yes, I'm including Heat in that! The set up is simplicity itself. A Hit man( Cruise)coerces a meek cab driver( Foxx) to ferry him around L.A as he terminates a list of targets over the course of 1 night. As premises goes it's deliciously efficient but hardly mind blowing. The brilliance of the film is taking this somewhat generic starting point and adding a level of nuance and characterisation lacking in the vast majority of genre thrillers.Jamie Foxx was nominated for an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of a man discovering his balls as his circumstances go from bad to worse. It's Tom Cruise however( playing against type) who truly creates a classic character in Vincent- a psychopath who is both chilling and likable. Tom Cruise may be the worlds biggest movie star but it is easy to forget( and ignore) what a great character actor he can be on the rare occasion he is able to shed his hero image. His career may have produced more iconic roles but for my money this is his most interesting.Another element that also helps differentiate Collateral from the genre crowd is the cinematography. While most film makers try as hard as possible to use digital to replicate the film look, Michael Mann boldly goes in completely the opposite direction. Digital is proudly made to look digital-giving the film a hyper real( and unique) aesthetic it would otherwise lack.I debated whether I should rate this film a 10 out of 10 because it is does have noticeable flaws( although what film doesn't when you look hard enough). As a myriad of other reviewers have pointed out, the 3rd act feels rather predictable and by the numbers in comparison to the inventive excellence of the first 75 minutes or so. None the less, while the ending may not hold any surprises, crucially it is still satisfying and does not derail( unlike so many movies with that begin with such promise)what has come before. In fact, upon my second viewing, what initially felt like plot contrivance suddenly felt thematically elegant and exactly as it should be.A great, tense thriller. Watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stylish Michael Mann Thriller,"Collateral is a film based around events on one particular night and is directed by Michael Mann who directed Heat. There is a strong cast here with Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx and Mark Ruffalo. Cruise is outstanding as Vincent, a professional hitman, and it really is interesting to see Cruise play the bad guy for once. Jamie Foxx is solid in his performance but i felt Mark Ruffalo was wasted in the film as his role didn't really go anywhere. The film is stylishly shot as would be expected from a Mann film and you really get a sense of on the edge danger as it becomes more obvious as the film progresses what a dangerous individual Vincent is. Action scenes are expertly staged and the sharp dialogue and the interaction between Cruise and Foxx in the battle of wits is fantastic. A slight downside is the supporting characters have very little to do and the FBI and police elements feel a bit tagged in. I have seen Collateral a couple of times in the past and always enjoyed it, and on revisiting it again this thriller still stands up.

"""Take Comfort In Knowing You Never Had a Choice""","You're driving a car. There's a man sitting behind you. He intends to kill 5 people and wants you to drive him to them. What do you do? This concept is the focus of Collateral, putting a normal man in to an impossible situation and following his desperation as he tries to do whatever he can to make it through the night.Whilst this is the film's story, it begins as a movie with a far different tone. To begin with we follow cab driver Max (Jamie Foxx) as he carries out his normal night of fares. He picks up a woman named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and they flirt and talk as he drives her on the journey. He talks of his dreams of making his own Limo company and she talks of her stressed life as a Lawyer. It ends with her thanking him and passing a number. This scene is great partly because it works so well on its own, almost like a separate short film. It's a romance that does not feel phoned in at all, but instead develops some genuine chemistry between the pair.More importantly, it's an essential scene in showing us the kind of man Max is in his normal life. He's just a regular guy, who may dream of his limo business but has never had the nerve to act. It's important we see this so we can understand the normal person he is before his life is very suddenly thrown into disarray. This happens when a man named Vincent (Tom Cruise) pays Max $600 to drive him for the night and get him to the airport as he hates life in the city and wants to leave as soon as possible. However Max discovers that his passenger is a hit- man and is taken hostage to drive Vincent to 5 targets he needs to kills that night. After this we watch as Max reluctantly drives him wherever he's told, trying to get away from at every possible turn and reduce the death toll in Vincent's path.By all rights the plot is something that you would expect from a typical action movie. But the film is able to elevate it far above the standard action movie formula through the very realistic approach it uses to tackle the story. This is done by constantly grounding the story through Max. He's nothing like your usual John McClane action hero who spouts out one liners and makes light of the situation, but instead a very uncertain and terrorised victim. His attempts to get away from Vincent are often badly thought out and he reacts to murder just as any ordinary person would. Foxx's down to earth performance is definitely the anchor of the film as it ensures that the focus is not on the action, but rather a tense conversation between a sociopathic killer and a man in fear of his life and the lives of those around him.When it comes to who you might picture in the role of a murderer, it's unlikely that Cruise would be the first person to come to mind. However Cruise also does a great job at playing outside his usual roles. Instead of being the cocky likable hero, he's a very detached man who's able to blend into crowds and drift in and out without turning a single head. He's utterly ruthless with no regard for human life and will do anything he needs to get the job done. He doesn't even feel guilt for any of his actions and looks down on others like Max who do feeling it as redundant to feel empathy for people he never even knew. He even disdains the typical life of people in a city like Los Angeles, where people seem to just drift through their lives and never take any real risk in their lives.This story could have all too easily been a run of the mill action movie. But fortunately through both Mann's great direction, a screenplay that knows to put the focus on character over action and great casting, it becomes a truly great thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

A great action thriller. but ...,"To get them out of the way first, Cruise and Foxx are both as good as I've seen them. The script is a bit flaky. The girl was obviously dragged in at a late stage of the writing conferences, when they were running out of plot resolution options. Also, suspension of incredulity set in for me in the nightclub scene, when Vincent evades everyone and everything and manages to drag Max out of the back door despite the combined opposition of the the LAPD and about 2000 boppers, but what the hell, in a Mann movie you have to keep the action moving, don't you? Which brings me to the direction itself. Wow! Mann is the best around at managing and tweaking the pace - just when you expect him to slow down, he speeds up; just when you expect him to speed up down the road he's on, he takes a diversion and slams on the brakes - masterly! A minor criticism - the dialogue is often drowned out by the music, which is a shame as 'buddy movies' like this tend to rely on the conversations between the two male buddies.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Excellent,"I enjoyed ""Collateral"" quite a bit. Not that surprising maybe since i consider Michael Mann a very competent, but maybe not that exciting, director.""Collateral"" has a few things going for it. First of all it has a story and script that is original without being revolutionary. Also it's reasonably plausible without becoming dull or too focused on staying true to reality. With this script the movie could have been a decent thriller. However there are two things that lift this movie and make it better than decent. The first of which are the actors, the second the directing.Tom Cruise is something of a mystery to me. I have trouble standing him when he does his frantic noisy parts, like in ""Jerry Maguire"". But as soon as he comes to his senses and keeps it down he can be excellent. He is very good in ""Collateral"", better than i thought he could be in a part like this one. It doesn't feel like familiar Tom Cruise territory to say the least. Still though Tom Cruise is still Tom Cruise and i expect some quality from him. The one who surprised me was Jamie Foxx. I still feel that somewhere along the line i missed something with this guy. One day he was the irritating guy in ""Any Given Sunday"" or the loser in ""Booty Call"". Next day he's excellent in movies like this one, and perhaps most notably in ""Ray"". The chemistry between Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise is perhaps the biggest key to why this movie works.I also mentioned the direction. There is a sense of style to everything that Michael Mann does. Even if i find him rather dull sometimes i can't deny his talent and his sensitive fingertips. Here the visual style, the music and the pace is mixed in an excellent way. Scenes that could have been pathetic are carried with a steady hand by Mann, all the way through the rather weak ending.So, what about flaws? This movie is not a ten, so what's wrong with it? Well, for one i DID find the ending to be weak. It just didn't live up to the rest of the movie. Of course i can't really say any more without ruining it for you. But still. Also there is the thing about originality, but that is a minor thing.So, even though this is not one of the most original movies in recent years i think most people will enjoy it. I found it to be a display of excellent film-making, acting and directing. While a few more elements of chance and surprise would have spiced things up, this is still well worth watching and one of the best thrillers of 2004.I rate it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great for a short while, but the end kills it","This movie begins quite well. Its director has spent a great deal of interview time discussing his attempts to make an intelligent action movie. I'll give him credit in that the movie begins as such. There are plenty of great comments for this film going into detail about these aspects.However, with about half an hour left, the movie loses all intelligence. It goes from being an interesting movie to a brainless one, with the plot following the typical, predictable mindless rail of every similar movie from the 80s.Suddenly the characters become invincible and survive what would kill or maim anyone else. Suddenly the moons align and impossible, implausible coincidences dominate the movie. Suddenly closing your eyes and firing blindly becomes the best way to fire a weapon.Such a shame. The movie had a chance to be quite good, but it becomes by-the-numbers, and takes its audience for granted. The movie assumes that once you've committed 70 minutes to it you no longer have a brain. It tries to pull the wool over the eyes of its audience, insults their intelligence, and treats them like sheep.Worth watching, but I wouldn't recommend finishing it unless you like to be treated as a child.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of Tom Cruise's best performances,"Collateral is a quintessential Michael Mann thriller with a game of cat and mouse between two people from opposite worlds that has the philosophical debates to make the down time equally thrilling. It's equal parts relentless and ruthless as people are dispatched with no fanfare and like all good neo-noirs, it turns the setting into a character in itself.Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are perfectly cast with an unusual relationship considering Cruise is holding Foxx hostage but still finds time to offer life advice. Jamie Foxx is really good at portraying his character's growing stress, naturally escalating the stakes. Tom Cruise takes a big swing as a ruthless hitman by going against his usual roles and making good use of that usually out of place natural intensity.Michael Mann is at the top of his game with his direction here, containing all his best preoccupations on the page and screen with cinematography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron that's stylish, intense and unafraid to embrace the grain of the image. The soundtrack adds so much style and the score by James Newton Howard & António Pinto can match it until the third act where it pivots into ratcheting up the tension for a terrific final chase.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Just brilliant.,"I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, so I didn't start watching with high hopes. I don't think I've ever been more wrong in my life.Story: Jamie Foxx plays Max, a longtime running cab driver, who picks up Vincent, played by Tom Cruise, who says he needs to make a few stops within the night, and if it's all done by a certain time, Max earns a considerable amount of money. Shortly after the first stop, it's revealed that Vincent is a contract killer, and all the stops are his next victims. As this review is spoiler free, I won't go into further detail, but all I can say is that this story is extremely well written.Characters: Tom Cruise is very convincing as an assassin, and he and Foxx's character have a strange sort of chemistry that just works out well. The supporting characters do their parts well too.Screenplay: The cab scenes are relaxing in a strange sort of way. The camera wobbles while they're in it, and though that may sound crude, it feels like you're in the cab with them. The action scenes are shot extremely well too.Overall: This film is just awesome for anyone looking for a suspense film with a hint of action that has a good plot. Even if you're not a fan of Jamie Foxx or Tom Cruise, this film will make you forget that. And since you can pick up the DVD brand new for about 7 bucks today, I'd definitely check it out sometime. 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Tom the Bad Guy,"For once, Tom Cruise isn't the good guy. I was beginning to get sick of his typecast American Hero role in every movie, perhaps apart from the dismal Vanilla Sky. Then came the role of Vincent, a hit-man who is ruthless and relentless, yet at times displaying streaks of compassion and empathy towards his hired taxi driver, played by Jamie Foxx.Sometimes you have got to 'pity' Tom Cruise. Year after year, he's hoping to get a shot at the elusive Oscar, ever since he got nominated for Jerry Maguire. Last year's majestic The Last Samurai saw his hopes of landing an Oscar nod take a blow as he was completely overshadowed by Ken Watanabe, who deservedly landed himself a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nom. Similarly this year sees Cruise taking on an uncharacteristically villainous character in Collateral in hope of fulfilling his wishes, and yet again he gets trumped by the more impressive 'supporting' performance of Jamie Foxx (strange, considering 'supporting actor' Foxx takes up more screen time than Cruise). God, he must really hate Foxx... not one but two acting noms in a year. At the end of the day, what Cruise has are just his 20 million bucks paycheck per movie to console himself with. Poor guy eh? I didn't find Foxx's role particularly memorable, so it is a surprise that he was nominated and will be a shock if he does get the gold for this show. The movie though, is masterfully handled throughout by Michael Mann, who in my opinion, deserves an Oscar nom more than Foxx for this film. A tight story, great action scenes, steady pacing and excellent chemistry between the two leads are all characteristics of this entertaining thriller. Even the much criticised ending, which I found was not that lame and unbelievable, fails to make this overall an enjoyable movie experience.Who should watch: Anyone who doesn't believe that Tom Cruise can actually act 'evil'Who shouldn't watch: Taxi drivers who do night shiftsRating: 7.7",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Decent Thriller with a standout performance,"Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx and Michael Mann. 3 Hollywood heavyweights, but i'm not a huge fan of any of them. My issue with Mann is that i feel he often values his directive 'style' over substance in his films, although ""Heat"" and ""The Insider"" are among my favorites. I loved Foxx in ""Any Given Sunday"" and of course he was great in ""Ray"", but i feel like he's been living off the ""Ray"" performance ever since 2004, as i can't think of any character he was really impressive playing since then. Tom Cruise is an actor i've always sort of hated as he is usually the 'All-American' heroic good-guy with a plastered smile on his face and that has always bugged me, as i don't particularly buy into any of those roles with him. But in this film, Tom Cruise plays stoic hitman ""Vincent"" and just completely steals the movie.Foxx plays ""Max"" who is an LA cab driver on a routine night shift until Cruise's ""Vincent"" steps into his cab and makes a deal with Max to be his personal chauffeur for the next few hours as he goes around the city of LA closing out 'business deals'. Max agrees, but quickly finds out Vincent isn't exactly who he thought he was. Adding in a sub-plot of a team of police detectives and federal investigators who are trailing behind Vincent and Max's rendezvous to pick up the pieces and you've got solid formula for high drama. There are plot holes of course, but the story-line and characters are engaging, so it's of little annoyance.I recommend ""Collateral"" for Tom Cruise alone. This is the only role of his (i know of) where he played the antagonist and he locks you in the moment he appears on screen. His 'Calm, Cool and Collective' demeanor is captivating. Another reason to watch is Mann's Direction. This film still has that grainy lens (which i hate) that Mann often goes with, but some of the imagery and depictions of LA as a backdrop to this story is unmatched compared to any other film set in southern California. There is a turning point in the film in which Max and Vincent watch 2 Wolves cross a city intersection as Audioslave's ""Shadow of the Sun"" kicks in and there is a shot of each character in the cab with tall palm tree silhouette's in the blue LA sky in the background and it is a prime example of Mann's artistic talent combined with his ability to submerge the audience deeper into the story as he hints at a future showdown between our 2 main characters.Only a few minor complaints, which is Jamie Foxx's performance, although anyone would have paled in comparison to Cruise in this film. Foxx isn't necessarily 'bad', but there is a stark contrast imo. There are scenes in the cab in which Max and Vincent are having some inane dialogue that feels a bit out of place, and i really just think Cruise and Foxx don't have great chemistry together. It doesn't ruin the film, but i feel like Foxx was replaceable in this7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
I don't believe I will ever tire of Michael Mann's perspective on the human race.,"I don't believe I will ever tire of Michael Mann's perspective on the human race. Cruise is the assassin, a cold, relentless killer without remorse, fulfilling a contract as quickly and efficiently as possible. Jada Pinkett Smith is the doer, an assistant federal prosecutor who is focused and dedicated to making the world a safer place by making sure the criminals end up behind bars. Jamie Foxx is an everyman caught up in a situation he cannot control trying to survive. He is a cabbie with dreams of becoming a limo service owner, and like most of us, lacks the ambition to follow it through. The way his life is going, he will end up driving a cab for the rest of his life. The polarized characters in this drama make for more than just a crime story. It is the battle we all face everyday, the battle of our ambitions and goals being quelled by complacency and routine. It is the battle most of us lose, unless we are fortunate enough to find an epiphany that changes our lives. For two hours, Mann escorts us through the battle is a unique and singular perspective that only he can manage, and this film keeps you on the edge of your seat as Max reaches that epiphany and develops into the everyman who can attain a higher plain. Rated R for violence and language, the sheer integrity and power of this film make it collectible as one of Mann's best pieces. The performances are brilliant, the photography and setting is superb, and the film concludes with a resolution that will bring you to a realization of just how meaningful life can be.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best thrillers in recent years.,"Max (Jamie Foxx), a taxi driver, falls victim to Vincent (Tom Cruise), who takes him hostage so that he could complete five hits in one night in the city of Los Angeles. With a basic plot at that, one could think about how predictable the show would become.Thankfully, it doesn't.Thanks to a solid script and masterful performances by Cruise and Foxx, the movie is saved from losing credibility. Mostly a character-driven movie, Collateral is a throwback to the old Noir genre of the 50's, and we get it with a modern and masterful touch, kudos of director Michael Mann, who, no matter what, seem to inject flair and energy into his actors. I mean, just look at Heat! Notice how intense Pacino and De Niro were acting. This shows how good his direction can be.Cruise steals the limelight of the show, something he could not quite achieve during the previous years. Here, he plays a cold-blooded villain for the first time, and he makes the character into his own. He has believability and that look of viciousness in his eyes. In fact, I myself did not believe that Cruise was playing the hit-man until 50 minutes into the movie. It is with strong belief that Cruise was robbed of even an Oscar nomination.Jamie Foxx is also excellent as Max, the cab driver. His character is an ordinary human, an Average Joe, that is suddenly thrown into the world of crime and violence the moment Vincent steps into the cab. Foxx also delivers credibility into the role, making us wonder what would he do next, as Foxx's character represents us, the regular, normal, audience, who is experiencing the fear that he is while watching the movie.Supporting actors are also good here. Mark Ruffalo delivers a credible performance as Fanning, who is investigating the five hits. Javier Bardem is superb as his brief portrayal as Vincent's employer, Felix. And Jada Pinkett-Smith is good in her brief performance as Annie, a lawyer who is dropped off by Max right before Vincent steps in.The storyline is basic, but it's the screenplay that compels us. The lines are sharp and crisp, and made even more believable when executed by the actors. The tension is there, and it makes the story more human. Layer by layer, minute by minute, the story unravels slowly and in a steady pace, so that the audience is able to understand the situation and become engrossed in it.The action sequences are handled nicely. Superb camera work and editing. They are loud, fast, swift and brutal. The best example of such a scene is the climax. I won't spoil it for you, see it for yourself.The direction, as mentioned earlier, is superb. Michael Mann adds another classic movie to his resume. Here he adds his elements into making another one of his masterpiece, that made ""Heat"" great. Overall, he really injects life and credibility into the movie, giving such realism and flair in the picture.The cinematography is handled also superbly. Here, Mann shot the film in HD so that we would be able to see night-time Los Angeles in all its glory. Add a haunting score by James Newton Howard, and you have an atmosphere that is gritty, urban, and most of all, realistic.Overall, a breath of fresh air from the now not-so-original Hollywood, and one of the best thrillers for the new millennium. Kudos to Cruise for giving an outstanding performance and to Mann for making an old story seem new.A must see.8.894/10Delton",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stylish slick thriller,"A very stylish and slick thriller that really excites, mainly due to the great performances by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise - in a very unusual role here.Foxx plays LA cab driver Max who, when dropping off sexy lawyer Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), picks up a passenger who proves to be more than a little difficult! Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a hit-man, and orders Max to take him to 5 different destinations throughout the night, to carry out his hits.What you may think could run out of steam pretty easily, really keeps the viewer glued to the screen and guessing how Max will get out of the nightmare situation he has found himself plunged into. Cruise is great as the cold hearted killer, and still oozes his usual charisma in a totally alien role to what he's used to.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"So much style, so little substance","To me, this movie captured the essence of Miami Vice much more than Mann's actual Miami Vice movie. This movie has the look, the colors, the characters, etc. Anybody that remembers back to the good old days of Miami Vice, remembers that the bulk of each episode was centered around driving around the city at night and looking cool in clubs. Well, this movie is centered around those two things as well. I have to admit, it looks so cool. HOWEVER, the story is very weak and to say the ending is a stretch is the understatement of all-time. In fact, I would dare say that the ending was ridiculous. Cruise and Foxx do their absolute best with what is written for them and in most Michael Mann films that would be enough. However, Michael Mann usually writes his own films, this one he did not. The result is obvious and quite inferior in comparison to other Mann products, such as Heat. I think anything over 7 given to this movie is a real stretch. However, the cool look of the film keeps me from going under 6. It is just sad that Mann felt the need to make a money grab with this film and that is what Collateral is. It is a stylish, oversimplified story with major star power to draw people in. Mann used to be about style with a lot more substance. I liked the old Mann better.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
"After all, what does it matter?","A good action movie, an apparently simple plot, but which, in addition to the killing, seeks to propose a reflection on how often life does not matter, on the one hand, people who do not seek to fulfill their dreams, hiding in lies and excuses for not getting them and on the other hand due to this urbanization and more and more people in the world the death of someone is just another statistic for the rest of the world. I believe that this is the important message of the film, nothing matters, that must be why the film does not make an effort to delve into the characters and many of them end up dying without even knowing the name or in the case of Detective Fanning that we do not have its outcome as we wait. A great movie with good action scenes, Tom Cruise in his role is excellent in the action scenes and Jamie Foxx well played a man who has his life turned upside down from one moment to the next.A good action movie, I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
I must be missing something,"Whats all the fuss about with this movie. I didn't care about anybody, I guess I'm supposed to care about whats going to happen to Max, no connection for me at all.

Anybody who didn't see that coming a mile off hasn't seen many films in the past ten years. I've also seen suggestions on other posts that this was an action movie, where was that then?

Effective psychological thriller,"There's something eerie about driving through Los Angeles in the middle of the night; things are moving and there are people about, but overall the large bustling city is sleeping. No one can capture this feeling like Michael Mann; he did it in his modern crime classic ""Heat,"" and he does it here. This film has the earmarks of a classic thriller: a brilliant script, an expert director, and a couple of nice performances. Unfortunately, the most important role in this film is miscast.Max (Jamie Foxx) is a nice guy cab driver who would rather help a stressed out fare (Jada Pinkett Smith) get to her destination faster than go her way and get a few extra bucks because it takes longer. However, the stressed out yuppies that he usually has to deal with are going to be the least of his problems. Late one night, a man walks into his cab and tells him that he will pay 600 dollars to have Max drive him to six destinations in one night. But it isn't before long before Max realizes that the man, who calls himself Vincent (Tom Cruise) isn't closing a real estate deal; he's knocking off targets.For the most part, this is a two-man game of cat-and-mouse between the cold Vincent and the meek Max. It's almost all dialogue and no real action, which would be okay if the film had a better villain. As written, Vincent is a cold, brutal killer. As played by Tom Cruise, he's just Tom Cruise without his famous cheeky grin. Cruise is just not up to the task of playing a conscienceless villain. As the soft-spoken cabbie Max, Jamie Foxx is terrific. His strong performance keeps us interested in this unfolding drama, primarily because it's impossible not to like him.After ""Heat,"" this is easily Michael Mann's best film. It's stylishly filmed, and it oozes with the after-hours atmosphere. There are moments when it drags slightly, and things can get a little confusing here and there, but Mann is a master craftsman.Without a doubt I recommend the film. The suspense builds steadily into a heart-pounding (if slightly overdone) ending, and it's almost always interesting. But I just can't help but feel that this movie could have been so much more if someone more able to play a sociopathic killer than Tom Cruise could have played Vincent.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Has the balls to ask, ""Are you on the same page with yourself?""","What do you want to do with your life? Are you really doing it? Or are you just giving lip service to some higher ideal, deluding yourself thinking ""someday, maybe,"" but ""not right now?"" What excuses are you giving yourself? To be clear, this is primarily an action movie centering around a professional hit-man and his targets. You don't have to entertain these questions to enjoy it.Yet not since Fight Club's scene in which Brad Pitt holds a gun to that store clerk's head & warns him he'll be dead if he doesn't pursue his dreams, has a movie had the balls to ask -- ""Are you on the same page with yourself?""Again, you don't have to identify with the guy who has the sh**ty job & has a dream to start his own business but never acts on it to appreciate this movie. It stands on it's own as tense, well-acted assassin flick.But it's rare in that it asks much more of you than to just root for the underdog hero. It gives you pause to reflect.Granted, addressing the sobering reality that you might in fact be living out an existence that is but a mere shadow of what sort of life you really could be living -- that's not easy to come to terms with. It's much easier to stay plugged in to whatever Matrix you may be living in.Yet I like challenging movies like this. Along w/ Groundhog Day, Remains of the Day, & Shawshank Redemption, this is among my favorite ""wake-up call"" how-am-I- living-my-life movies. I think it will be one of those deserving of multiple viewings over the years, one of those I'll probably get something new from every time.Terrific flick.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Tom Cruise: The Original John Wick,"The movie starts off relatively slow, but the moment Tom Cruise gets into Jamie Foxx's taxi is when the movie kicks off. The interactions between the two are a joy to watch. Even though Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a villain in this movie, He's just so charismatic that some part of me was rooting for him. Vincent is like John Wick before he existed. This movie may not be as fast paced as John Wick, but it's more intense in my opinion. I've never been the biggest fan of Jamie Foxx, but he played his role as Max, the taxi driver pretty well. A part of the movie I found to be unrealistic is that near the end, Max suddenly knows how to use and shoot guns pretty well. Overall though, I enjoyed the movie and would gladly watch it again in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
In a word,"The worst film that I can remember seeing in a long time. Experience has taught me to stay away from the slapstick ""comedy"" and teen movies, but this was sluggish, hard to understand (due to poor diction) garbage of the first degree.Cruise must have been desperate for money to agree to ""act"" in this pile of manure....The opening scenes set up the film to an extent and for a while it looked good - the Taxi driver had a warmth and the female passenger (leter to be the last on the hit list) jelled well and there was a chemistry between them.Once the carnage began though the reason for the killings and the way in which they were done was not as clever as the trailer depicted. Some of the characters parts in the carnage seemed unclear, for a while you could not tell the goodies from the baddies....My wife fell asleep half way through and has declared that she would have to think twice before watching another DVD with Cruise in, we liked Last of the Samurai and loved that - but this latest attempt was futile. I just hope he is in better form in War of the Worlds - a film I want to see having enjoyed the old version.GARBAGE",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Everyone told me that this was the movie to watch if I would rent, so I figured to give it a shot. The whole movie you just keep wondering what would happen next and how it would turn out in the end. It was kind of weird, because you feel like Tom was in some ways right as a hit man, but then you snap back into your senses and ""Wait! No! He's killing people!"". I'm very serious when I say that he is so in tune with his role. He was very convincing as well as Jamie. Jamie does well as a man who is on the edge of insanity.

"""It's only a dead guy.""","I'm starting to more and more notice Michael Mann. I know many see him as merely a director of action films and while many of his films sport dazzling spectacles of bullets and body blows, he makes sure characterization is first and foremost. That's the focal point of this movie: character. I've watched the documentaries exemplifying how much of a background Mann gives the characters in addition to Stuart Beattie's original screenplay and its astonishing. Of course, on camera only so much can be put in to keep the film streamlined. That's Mann's style; still each character feels very fleshed out due to not just the dialogue but their subtle mannerisms.Jamie Foxx honestly surprised me with his performance. He played a withdrawn character and perfectly so. Jada was pretty damn good, and so was Mark Ruffalo. Practically taking the cake though is Tom Cruise as Vincent. In my opinion its one of his best roles ever. Nihilistic, logical and best of all a cold-hearted efficient killer, this character is a testament to a downcast ideology but one that is impossible to dismiss. Well done, Cruise, well done. The movie is basically a tale of different lives suddenly becoming intertwined.A damn good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A taut thriller with two strong performances and one great director.,"""Collateral"" isn't a terribly original motion picture. However, it's the strength of the lead performances and the stylish direction of Michael Mann that obscures the weaknesses in plotting and credibility. . For the most part ""Collateral"" remains a sharply taut thriller but ever so gradually towards the end it tests our plausibility nerves. The movie never fails, but it never really deepens either. The story line never deviates from going somewhere unexpected, but at least it's always satisfying.Los Angeles cab driver Max Durocher (Foxx) lives an incredibly mundane life. He drives a cab day in and day out - and has for the last twelve years. His only escape from reality is a photo of a tropical island and the fact that he wants to start his own limo company. All that changes when a government investigative attorney named Annie Ferrell (Jada P. Smith) gets in his cab from the airport. She's wound tight, getting ready for a big case the next morning, but he charms her into talking and makes a favorable impression. Immediately after dropping Annie off downtown, he picks up a fare that is known only by his first name – Vincent (Cruise). Vincent offers Max a deal he can't refuse - $700 for making five stops, then getting him to the airport for his flight out of LA. As the L.A.P.D. and F.B.I. begin to put the pieces together, they race to intercept the two of them. Max and Vincent's survival becomes dependent on each other, in ways neither would have imagined.The survival-of-the-fittest, do-or-die theme eventually becomes rather one note. The amusing, exceptional first half of the film is undermined when the story races towards a prevailing, mechanical conclusion. Acting and atmosphere define the film, but there are times when style can become substance, and this is one of these instances. The performances by Cruise and Foxx are the highlights, and Mann's direction guarantees that any chance of boredom or disinterest will not materialize.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A loner's voyage,"Michael Mann has a fascination with lonely men that is somewhat intriguing. Heat similarly cast the two main characters as loners, one who is as ruthless as he is self-justifying, and the other simply views his current life as vehicle to a utopia.Cruise is often underrated as an actor, but I believe he has a good deal of versatility and genuine acting talent. In this film, he delivers an unusually strong performance as the ruthless hit-man ""Vincent."" Some of the execution he carries out are filmed with enthralling dazzle (especially the nightclub scene and the jazz singer).Jamie Foxx did a fantastic job playing the role of the innocent loner Max and the dialog between him and Vincent was terrific and well acted.A few weak points let the film down though. First of all, the final 20 minutes of the film was extremely unimaginative and predictable. From the identity of the final target to the final grand ""showdown"" it seemed far fetched and reminiscent of silly Hollywood endings we expect from films with a no-name cast and director. Second, the police side of the story was not terribly interesting and a little over-performed. Nonetheless, these sorts of things didn't take all the gloss of what is otherwise a great watch which mixes marvellous characterisations and engaging action sequences.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Here in Collateral he is very good as Vincent, the amoral hitman complete with underpinning nihilistic philosophy.Foxx is also good as Max - realising he's in the wrong place at the wrong time. We kinda feel concerned for him!Mark Ruffalo is there trying to figure out what's going down. He's ok.Overall Collateral is entertaining, nothing more. The dialogue is ok, story - believable.

Gripping Suspense and Some Great Performances,"At this point, I haven't had a good deal of exposure to Michael Mann's films. The only film of his I'd seen before this was 1986's ""Manhunter"" and I wasn't all that impressed, but ""Collateral"" blew me away. It's an intense, character-driven thriller that had me hooked to the screen from the Cruise's arrival at the airport in the opening scene. The concept of the film itself is simple: Vincent is a hit-man who hires/forces cab-driver Max to drive him around Los Angeles over the course of a night while he completes his assignment of wiping out five key figures in an upcoming trial. While the story and cinematography were great, it was the main characters that had my attention.As odd a person as I find him in his personal life, I have to admit that I find Tom Cruise to be an awesome actor. I love nearly every performance of his and that goes double for his role as the villain in this film. Cruise is the hit-man Vincent, and he does an awesome job of portraying the cold-blooded killer while keeping him charismatic (to an extent). The majority of the movie is his interactions with Jamie Foxx, in his role as Max. Foxx, who I've only ever really seen in primarily comedic roles until ""Collateral"", pulls off the role nicely and it's fun to watch his attitude evolve from the frightened, panicked cabbie in the beginning to a strong-willed individual who takes his life into his own hands. In addition to the main characters, the film is FULL of high-quality actors/actresses in supporting roles. I have to admit, I didn't even recognize Mark Ruffalo (as LAPD Detective Fanning) or Javier Bardem (as Felix) until they were pointed out to me. Ruffalo, another actor I'm primarily used to seeing in comedic roles, is really absorbed into his role of the cop on Vincent's trail.After reading/learning as much about this movie as I have, I am seriously impressed with Michael Mann. I loved this movie from the first time I saw it, but I gained a whole new respect for it when I learned of the detail he went into as a director to develop the characters of the film into what they are. He went so far as to write up complete background stories for both Max and Vincent to give the actors a sense of the character's histories and personalities, and I think it's really reflected in the movie. I've seen that this movie does get a bit of hate from some people out there, but I fail to see why. It's more than entertaining, the suspense keeps a tight hold on you until the end, and I feel that these are some of the best performances from both Cruise and Foxx. In my opinion, this movie is worth checking out, if only to form your own opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Six years later and it looks sublime, magic, meaningful; that's it, it looks meaningful. There's a lot of things cribbed from genre here, the alienated lone wolf without a past and a list of people to kill, the average schmuck with a dead-end life all big dreams and none realized, much like you and me, caught up in extraordinary circumstances, cops hot on the tail of the wrong guy.This all melody and words, all neat and orderly arranged in harmonies easy for the ear to identify, it's the tune that randomly comes up in the radio while you drive around and you find yourself humming along with it.

On one level Collateral, Collateral the taut gripping crime thriller, strums in its guitar basic questions made of plot and hung on empathy, ""will the cabbie make it out alive?"", ""will the cops get the right guy?"", ""will he save the girl?"", questions posed then accepted or declined. Then as you drive around humming the familiar melody, you catch something from the corner of your eye, out the open car window you see dogs crossing the road with eyes gleaming in the night, through an open window you're allowed a glimpse into a cramped two-room apartment and a couple of Chicanos are lounging with a laundry line between them, weird mural paintings next to gas stations, whole streets ablaze with the neon lights of shop signs.And then at some point this cacophony of bustling city life begins to make sense, now we're beginning to pick up something behind the melody and words and the tune having served its purpose begins to fade in the background. Now a different freejazz Collateral reveals itself off-melody and behind the words, the moody noir with the dreamlike latenight atmosphere, where the backgrounds are deep and the nightskies have a curious bronze hue to them. Now we begin to hear Los Angeles play itself so that it's not only a matter of two thugs getting gunned down in a deserted backalley, it's the deserted backalley that matters because Mann supplies the movie with the surroundings proper in which the characters can love and die and face lifechanging dilemmas and be divert. I love this Collateral that suggests an entire world full of possibilities because it poses questions and leaves them open; and what if I took a right here? what if I got off the car and wandered down that alley? All this reminds me of the Dadaists and their reveries: or as Baudelaire would have it, ""to walk the city in order to experience it"".Near the end Mann shifts back to pounding techno rhythms as Collateral threatens to become an action movie, with chaotic shootouts inside dance clubs and the villain indestructible bursting through panels of glass and jumping on moving trains, but this too is all part of the ceremony, part of the pasteboard formula and shibboleth meaningless created by the situation whose need it answers. At sunup the movie turns sober and lyrical, with some of that little death of profound exhaustion the crack of dawn always brings after an all-nighter, which is only fitting and proper for the occasion because someone is boarding the express train out of the world.",,Anonymous,Crime
Here is a movie i will always remember,"Collateral is one movie I will always remember watching.Collateral is a beautiful thriller and Jamie Foxx's portrayal of his character is welcoming and it gained him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Collateral is a crime thriller film from one of the best directors around Michael Mann and his directorial ace is how he paced the movie, not to mention the packaging and the way the plot unfolds is just magical. Cruise did very well in his portrayal of a villain he was so well composed and the way he spoke will pass the message across that this individual is ready to do anything to get the job done.Collateral has a hired assassin going on a ride with a taxi driver names Max (Jamie Foxx), all in the aim of making some stops and taking out some individuals that he was paid to do so. Max on the other hand had no idea that the passenger he was so eager to carry was one he never forget. Vincent (Tom Cruise) was the name of the passenger and he was ready to pay Max six hundred dollars to take him to some places.Now Max has been a Cabby for 12 years and $ 600 in one night just from one person looked like a nice deal, so he took it and not long things started to change and Max latter regretted the decision. He also had to stand up to Vincent which took some guts, and in the end we learn, if it sounds too good to be true ($ 600 for a night for some stops), probably it is.Collateral approaches you from a view of the hired assassins, and it solidifies the thought we have of them, heartless psychopaths with no morals at all. When you view the movie's build up to the eventual fallout of the relationship of the assassin and his unwilling apprentice, you just have to marvel on the way the story just kept flowing without send you to sleepyville.Perpetuation is one thing that this movie has, although it doesn't get tiring you will notice it. This nice thriller did have some cinematography flops especially when there are trying to achieve a close up, it looked amateur, which was the idea mind you, but it was not cool.The whole idea of a bad guy all up in suit and with white hair was just cool, as in Cruise looked cool in his portrayal. Collateral is one movie I will always remember watching and if you haven't seen it, I'm wondering why.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Collateral — Slow, moody, and tense, it's a great watch","Collateral is a crime movie like few others, by Michael Mann.The good. Great score. Excellent music. Solid and logical scenario. Captivating story. Nicely built characters with good depth, except for Felix and the FBI agents. Good camera work, if with some odd choices at time. The mood is impeccably set. It's smoothly done, slowly built up, and it's kept throughout the flick.The actors. Tom Cruise makes his first appearance as a criminal, and he gives us a great performance. Jamie Foxx is not doing his ""thing"", and by doing that, he perfectly complements Cruise. His character is the opposite of what he usually does, showing his true capabilities. It's a turning point for both actors.The bad. NothingThe ugly. She keeps running with her high heels. Seriously?The result. A great film with action, mood, intrigue, and even some romance.

"Solid Action Thriller, set in Grimy LA","The Good: Cruise, up until this point, was a leading man and all American hero and this film represents him at his coolest (before the wacky Scientology stuff). He's a legitimately good villain: menacing, unstoppable and very fun to watch. Fox is also really good, being the emotional heart of this film, and a guy who's pretty hard not to like. We've all been this guy.Also, I really like how Los Angeles actually feels like a real city, with actual people living there. For a city where seemingly every other Hollywood movie is set, we rarely actually get a sense of LA as anything other than ""neutraland USA.""The Bad : The movie does get a bit cheesy and over sentimental. There's a whole plot with Jada Pinkett Smith that really doesn't need to be there.The Ugly: Mark Ruffalo's slicked back hair.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Underappreciated film,"For me this was a fantastic film, the casting, the acting, the action, the plot, the score, the drama, the script, almost perfect and a unique film. This is what i expect from a Michael Mann film (from Miami Vice TV fame, and the classic film ""Heat""), too bad we do not see more of it. Tom Cruise gets credit for taking on the role of the antagonist, i did not expect that of him. I could watch this film every year and i bought a Blu-ray copy, a sign of a new classic for me. The only flaw was how unrealistically slowly the club evacuated during the shootout, but other than that i was blown away by this movie. Well done to the entire cast, the production, the script writers, and the direction.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stylish yet largely predictable and uninvolving.,"Collateral deals in the dark and violent world of Vincent (Cruise) a hit man out to remove a handful of key people from this life, and Max (Foxx) as the unlucky cab driver brought into this world by a collection of bad luck and unlikely coincidences.Opening with a teasing sequence involving Vincent at the airport, Collateral's subtlety ends with this slightly ambiguous scene and the questions it poses about Vincent's intentions. After this, Collateral presents a distinctly blunt plot blunted further with needless exposition.We are first presented with Max as he picks up customer Annie (Smith). This evolves into a half-hearted scene intended to build some form of connection between the two, in order to have this connection serve as a plot turn point later in the movie. However, whilst Foxx does an admirable job as the well-meaning, genuinely nice cab driver, Annie simply falls insignificantly into the background. Later in the movie, when Vincent's scheme ultimately comes to involve her, Annie remains a blank and unengaging character. Smith gives little in her performance, but to be fair there is little in Annie for her to work with, and the character is really disposable.Collateral is really about Vincent and Max. Everyone else is incidental, and in many cases superfluous.Max discovers Vincent's profession early on. It's rather hard to miss as a body falls from the fourth floor window onto his cab and Vincent calmly responds to Max's incredulous query with a dismissive 'I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him'. The body is stuffed into the taxi's boot  an out of character action for Vincent designed purely to create not one but two extremely contrived scenes later on. At this point Max is held as both hostage and driver while Vincent passes through LA on his quest to kill four more victims.Vincent and Max develop a curious relationship, with Max becoming surprisingly open at times and Vincent offering stark commentary about Max, about people, and about the universe. Collateral is about the differences between the two  on the one hand we have Max's good beardedness, lack of genuine ambition, and earnestness, while on the other we have Vincent's brutal, amoral, nihilism. During the course of the movie Max develops somewhat, and at one point in particular you can see the change occur.Foxx does a surprisingly good turn as the naive and frightened Max, with characterisation that almost makes you believe the changes that happen. Cruise too gives Vincent a suitably brutal portrayal and becomes a decent villain.There is a parallel, but lesser, plot involving the inevitable police and federal investigations but really this serves only to add unnecessary exposition to what we can clearly see with our own eyes. The involvement of some shallow, ineffectual, police figures does little to enliven the movie and in truth they are all but ignored.What Collateral really has going for it is style. This is perhaps not surprising given that director Michael Mann is of course famous for 80s style icon Miami Vice. Here he makes wonderful use of night-time LA, framing shots which simply ooze style and character. Both the wide vistas of streetlight lit LA, and the narrow focused shots of signs and lights evoke a strong sense of place. A highlight is certainly the climactic hunt in a darkened office, but again this is due to the flair of the shot, and to a lesser extent to Cruise's Vincent, rather than anything much else.Where Collateral fails is in the story and, to a lesser extent, in the secondary characters. Everyone other than Max and Vincent are really props, not people. They are set items used to push along the plot in predictable and expected ways. There is no development within any of them  though given the minimal screen time for any beyond the two principals this is hardly surprising. As a result they come across as flat and dull. We are perhaps not truly intended to care about Annie (Smith) and her fate, but rather Max and his. The problem with this approach is that we know what the fate of both of them will be from the moment that Annie climbs into Max's cab.Collateral has significant style. It offers spectacle and an occasional glimpse at excellence but mostly falls flat under a predictable plot which sags under the weight of the contrivances put in place to make it work. For Mann's next movie one can only hope that there is someone to help bolster the style with some real substance.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A comic movie?,"It seems it is not a comic movie. But when I saw it, a lot of people were laughing in the theatre. Mostly because of the unbelievable character of the taxi driver, a mix of goofy, tender, stupid (but never enough) man.

'HEAT' IT 'AINT,"No, no, no; whereas 'Heat' was a truly epic masterpiece, this Mann offering barely dribbles along. Tom Cruise, good an actor as he is, with barely a duff movie under his belt, cannot command the intensity of De Nero or Pacino when handed the ticking time-bomb. He really does try to understate his role, but, I feel, falls woefully short of the mark. As the five 'hits' come and go, the murky pit widens, with little to keep the audience enthralled. Even the trade-mark denouement, with slow pan and profound narrative left me feeling short-changed. You see, I didn't care about this anti-hero in the same way I cared about the loss of De Nero, in 'Heat'. the others were barely significant - lots of brooding close-ups, but no convincing emotion. Sorry to say this - I've been a great admirer of Cruise's work, he can be charismatic when given good company, here I found him floundering in the dark, with Michael Mann's 'metal-echo hammers on trash-bins' soundtrack, failing to compliment a weak script. Another dead body rides the subway for two hours on end.",,Anonymous,Crime

Tom Cruise is excellent... so is Jamie Foxx.,"The reason for watching this film should only be Tom Cruise. He is just extraordinary at this against-his-type role. That bronze hair and that steely accent just redefined him as a perfect villain here. You can't get a single bit of that handsome good guy with pretty smile. In ""The Last Samurai"" he was quite good, but here he is magnificent. And let's not forget Jamie Foxx also. He got an Academy nomination for this and why shouldn't he? Foxx perfectly portrays the simple-minded average-character taxi driver. Tough for him that ""Million Dollar Baby"" released this year, otherwise he got a fair chance for Supporting Actor too; although I'll argue that Foxx's character wasn't confined to a mere 'supporting' category.And Michael Mann is a top quality filmmaker. And I think this is better that 'Ali' or 'Heat'. There are several shots of the city L.A. which somehow adds to a totality in the film. I like this style... this calm description of a suspense story. And the music used throughout the film are excellent. Definitely one of the best movies of 2004.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worst Assassin in history,"If any of you have ever played the Hitmas video games you will probably think that you could do quite well as contract killer given the right tools. You'd probably be right, or at least you'd be a hundred times better than Vincent in this movie. Apparently the phrase ""silent assassin"" is not in his vocabulary. He doesn't even use silencers on his very loud gun.Tom Cruise plays Vincent - a thoroughly conspicuous looking character who is in LA for a spot of contract killing. He hires unhappy cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx) for the whole night. Five stops, five kills - all in a night's work.This arrangement might have worked if Vincent were competent in the least. But he's just terrible. He leaves evidence everywhere, makes moronic mistakes, walks in front of every CCTV camera in LA, leaves fingerprints everywhere, and blabs far too much to Max, who any half-competent assassin would off at the end of the night anyway. Whatever the bad guys are paying him, the paycheck far exceeds the skill. I know the face and name need to sell the movie, but surely you'd remember a suspicious guy who looked like Tom Cruise being at the scene of every murder in LA during the course of one night.Michael Mann directs the film with amazing skill, brilliantly capturing the multiple looks and feelings of night-time LA. There are many scenes of tangible atmosphere in Collateral, so much so that the film is eerily calming. Using a combination of digital cameras for the car scenes and 35mm (Super35 sadly, not anamorphic) for the interiors there are many gorgeous shots and stunning compositions.Cruise and Foxx have great chemistry together though it must be said that Foxx comes off as the better performer/character. Neither of them overact and keep their cool but there's a true realistic edge to his lonely cabbie than Cruise's idiot assassin who leaves incriminating exhibits A-Z all over LA.Look out for a blink-and-you-miss-it cameo from the Transporter himself right at the very start.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Extremely thrilling!,"I recently revisited Collateral, and I just have to share how much I love this movie! Seriously, it's a masterclass in tension and character dynamics. Tom Cruise steps way out of his usual roles as Vincent, a sleek and menacing hitman who commandeers Jamie Foxx's character, Max, a mild-mannered taxi driver, for a night of chaos through Los Angeles. From the very first scene, you feel the pulse of the city and the mounting intensity. The way the movie captures the nighttime vibe of L. A. is just gorgeous. The neon lights, the shadows, everything feels so alive. The cinematography, directed by Michael Mann, is absolutely stunning, using close-ups and night shots to create an intimate yet claustrophobic atmosphere that perfectly amplifies the tension. Cruise delivers a chilling performance. He completely embodies the role of Vincent, making you both fascinated and terrified of his character. His calm demeanor combined with ruthless efficiency creates an engaging contrast to Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Max, who is just trying to make his way through another night as a cab driver. Foxx brings such warmth and vulnerability to the role, and it's captivating to see his character's evolution as he's pulled further into Vincent's world. The dialogue is sharp, funny at times, and loaded with unexpected depth. It's not just an action thriller; it really delves into themes of fate, choices, and the ripple effects they create. The interplay between the two leads is fantastic, and I found myself rooting for Max while simultaneously feeling the stakes of his increasingly dangerous situation. The soundtrack also deserves a shout-out! The music perfectly complements the film's tone, enhancing those tense moments and making the action sequences even more gripping. Plus, there's something so exhilarating about watching a film that seamlessly blends action with genuinely meaningful storytelling.

TERMINATOR Tom Cruise,"I don't know if any of you has noticed this detail, I guess some of you have done it, but there is a little thing that I have thought about whist I watched this pure masterpiece. It's the postcard element, when Tom Cruise - or Jamie Fox - hands and watches the little postcard, showing the Pacific island. The impossible and ultimate dream of a life time. How not to think about THIEF, with James Caan handing a kind of photos patchwork of this whole past life, and showing it to Tuesday Weld, the girl whom he wants to live with. One picture means future, the other the past, I admit, but I could not prevent myself to think about this detail, me who has both features so many times. So many. Tom Cruise gives here a so brilliant performance as the villain, which reminds Arnold Schwarzenegger in TERMINATOR pursuing the couple Michael Biehn - Linda Hamilton. Or Lino Ventura in UN TEMOIN DANS LA VILLE. By the way I have heard, now in 2024, that Sly Stallone will play in ALARUM, where he should be a ruthless, cold blooded FBI agent hunting down a coouple of heroes in order to kill them.

tense thriller which grabs and holds you,"Gritty thriller from director Michael Mann which plays as a character study between two very different men from two very different worlds. One is a calculating, cold-blooded contract killer, the other an everyman cabbie with big dreams but little to show for it. Their interaction is the basis for this riveting story, as the cab driver is coerced into driving the reprehensible killer from one ""appointment"" to the next. Sharply directed with a vivid portrayal of the L.A. streets, the film never lets go as it takes viewers into a world of deception, murder, and the very depths of human nature. Cruise is excellent and delivers one of his most memorable performances to date as the remorseless assassin Vincent, and the film is a good showcase for Foxx who's simply riveting as his unsuspecting accomplice. Falters at the finale, but still lots of entertainment value due to the cat-and-mouse game between two strong leads. ***",,Anonymous,Crime
Beautiful and empty,"Nice idea of scenario for this road-movie at night. An exercise in style (how to film the street, how to film the city at night, how to film the inside of a cab).The film piles up aesthetic or even aestheticizing shots of the city at night, its buildings, its cars.In the middle of these aesthetic shots and worked musics, we have Jamie Foxx as a cab driver, losing his life, and Tom Cruise as a professional killer (but not the first of the class: he makes some mistakes, which allow dramatic articulations). The film is divided into stages during which Tom Cruise has to shoot an assisted witness, which doesn't please Jamie Foxx, with different locations each time, and different operating methods and therefore different consequences.All in all, this is a good work, but it's a bit empty. But this kind of thriller is sorely lacking in the American mainstream production of the 2010s (which was vitiated by superhero movies).",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Taxi driver,"Los Angeles, a soulless city, is seen at its best through the eyes of director Michael Mann. For two hours we are asked to come along for the ride in a film that will surely please a lot of viewers, while others might think they've seen it already. The screen play has a quick pace and Mr. Mann uses the music intelligently to enhance parts of the film.The big asset for this movie is the pairing of Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Both actors give performances that are amazing.Tom Cruise is the hired killer on his way to eliminate a few people throughout his night in L.A. Mr. Cruise is an actor that excels when he has good direction, as is the case in this one. Also, this actor, like Richard Gere, show their best when playing against type. As a romantic hero, Mr. Cruise can be bland, but as Vincent, the assassin, he is a force to reckon with.Jamie Foxx is excellent. He holds his own against Mr. Cruise and makes the picture his own, in many ways. This Max is a man that has ambitions but has, as yet, to realize them. His mind is in the Maldives resort where he would like to be, away from the stark realities of the daily grind of driving the streets and highways of the city of angels.The rest of the cast is equally good. Mark Ruffalo, as Fanning, makes an appearance that is completely different than his recent ones. This is an actor that always surprises. Amazing Jada Pinkett Smith is also good as the prosecutor who befriends Max at the beginning of the film. She is a lovely woman who projects an inner beauty that is rare to find in other young actresses. Finally, Irma P. Hall, as Ida, Max's sick mother makes the best of her short trip in front of the camera.One final note. It appears there is a trend among production designers to include chase sequences in the Los Angeles rapid transit system, as we have already seen in ""The Italian Job"", among others. Yet, for all the turmoil we see, the trains are immaculate and no there is no graffiti in sight. Hooray for L.A.!This is a film for action fans.

"5 stops, 5 stars","Once again, Michael Mann proves what a genius he is with his latest effort 'Collateral' starring Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett-Smith and a cameo from Jason Statham.  The film starts with a slick intro as to what's going on without giving anything away w/ introductions to the three main characters.  Tom Cruise is the anti-hero of the movie, Vincent, a smooth criminal whose line of work requires a straight-to-the-point attitude as well as a 'whatever' type attitude.  Tom Cruise brings the traits neccessary to Vincent - cold and calculating - even his VICTIMS shape out what Vince is all about. Jada Pinkett-Smith, with the little screen time she has, is a pivotal character in the film.  It would seem like she wasn't really drawn out much but as the story goes on, you see that she plays a big part for a role so small.  Jamie Foxx, as Max, damn near almost steals the show from Tom Cruise as an unassuming taxi driver.  The situation he's put in thanks to Vincent is like a blessing in disguise type - Even though he is an accidental accomplice, while he is with Vincent - he learns things about himself he never thought was in him [sp]such as the scene when Vincent insists that Max goes to visit his mother[/sp]....reading some of the comments, I see that some people were able to guess the ending but I honestly didn't try to guess as the movie itself was really unpredictable in between the five stops...though these tow characters are morally conflicted, there is a big connection.  The rest of the supporting cast do their respective jobs but it's the two who were supposed to shine the brightest who really stand out - I remember when Jamie Foxx used to be on in Living Color, and after many years, we get to see how talented he truly is even though I knew he was a good singer as well.  he's truly come a long way to land a role with someone as established as Tom Cruise...Collateral is not to be missed at all10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stylish Action Built on Character and Mann's Bravura,"For the most part, this is one sharp crime thriller that doubles as a character study of two lonely men. If that premise does not appeal to you, then you probably can't appreciate director Michael Mann's unique film-making style, which is an intoxicating mix of nocturnal urban sleekness and characters that peel off layers of their psyche to drive the plot. This is not a standard action film, not by a long shot, as it is really about the relationship between a hit man named Vincent and a cab driver named Max, thrown together by chance and becoming more inextricably connected as the convoluted story unfolds. Vincent is as mono-maniacally cold-blooded as one can expect in this type of film, but Stuart Beattie's script reveals a well-educated, rather erudite man who may have been triggered by an abusive childhood to follow this line of work. In salt-and-pepper hair and without his trademark smile, Tom Cruise is relatively good as Vincent, though as with most of his films, there is an air of posturing about his performance that negates the malice of his character. At the same time, when it comes to his character's profession, he is convincing as an expert at his craft, who has mastered a clear method of killing that absolves him of blame and conscience.The focal point of this 2004 film, however, is Max, who represents the story's moral conscience. He is also a complex figure, a man who has deluded himself with dreams of running his own limousine service. Max makes it sound convincing at first, but then his credibility starts to unravel under Vincent's astute microscope and as the immediate situation becomes more desperate. Consequently, he is forced not only to drive Vincent around LA but also to look at himself for what he is. Were it not for his uncanny impersonation of Ray Charles, this is the performance that would have pushed Jamie Foxx to the front ranks. As Max, he captures all the inner conflict showing surprising pockets of courage when he realizes he has nothing to lose. The interplay between Vincent and Max is what makes this film uniquely intriguing, as it is just not about a villain holding a reluctant victim hostage but about two men who leverage each other's blind spots and weaknesses to fulfill their immediate goals.Too infrequent on the screen recently, Jada Pinkett-Smith is sharp and memorable in a small but pivotal role as Annie, a federal prosecutor who gets drawn to Max at the beginning. Mark Ruffalo, taking a break from indies, is effective as the slicked-back LA detective who is not sure who his suspect is. Irma P. Hall has a briefly comic scene as Max's bedridden mother. Special mention needs to be given to the wondrous Javier Bardem, who takes a 180-degree turn from his recent saintly roles to play a single scene as the drug kingpin Felix, coolly menacing as he talks facetiously about Humpty Dumpty, Santa Claus and Black Peter. The scene between Foxx and Bardem is superbly played out as Max gradually steels himself into Vincent's identity. Mann's set pieces - in a scary Latin bar, in a frenzied Koreatown dance club - show the director at the height of his stylized creativity, and nighttime in LA has never looked more terrifyingly hypnotic than in the excellent camera-work by cinematographers Paul Cameron and Dion Beebe.It's a shame that the film gets more predictable toward the end when Vincent becomes his most nihilistic and Terminator-like and Max unconditionally heroic. In a fit of derivativeness, the story suddenly borrows heavily from ""Rear Window"" and ""Speed"" with a touch of ""The French Connection"". Although the cumulative effect is still suspenseful, the familiarity of the climax left me feeling a little empty especially after the plot was unfolding in such an audaciously creative manner. But I still recommend this movie for its overall originality. The two-disc set has plenty of extras - Mann's informative commentary, a feature-length making-of documentary, an interesting prep reel of Cruise and Foxx getting into their roles and just one deleted scene. Well worthwhile even if you are not a fan of this genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The camera work is horrible...the hand-held business is pretentious and takes away from the storyline.

"Coming at early the intersection of film and digital, and a real evolution point of Michael Mann as a filmmaker,","Collateral is a tight, finely tuned, experimental and influential existential action movie that gets nowhere near the acclaim it deserves.There's something resonant in the movie where every action, reaction, choice and beat of interplay feels charged from some hidden backstory or led by something we've already seen or heard earlier in the movie. Motivation and metaphor bleed together in typical Mann style and it creates something magical.Collateral is a tone poem painted visually. It's about dreams, doubt and self-deception. It's about ambition, duty and assertiveness. It takes well-worn tropes and structure and uses it to blow the doors off the action genre, and is more influential than it ever gets credit for.Beattie's script is a masterclass. It teases and delivers the correct amount of information. It's tangible in the way John Wick isn't and yet is mythical in the same proportion. It's crackling dialogue and rich slowly evolving characterisations are broad and cinematic and yet distill down the heart of man. And with this weaving script that manages to add and build, there's still a sense of immediacy to it. Mann elevating the material to something that's not stilted when it could be or bloated and instead is a compressed life-changing intersection.It's hard to overstate how unique it was to see Tom Cruise on screen portraying what felt like we we're seeing a new kind of professional on screen. A worker. His grey suit the perfect tool to obfuscate or blend in. He's a smart guy. A real guy, but a different, a broken man. The mechanical workmanlike specialist. The utter professional, a modern big city equivalent counterpoint to Reno's Leon. And Foxx is spectacular in this, the role he really needed. Rich, nuanced and shows range and a clear arc.The creepy plot of a mechanical hitman, more Terminator or Jason than Jason Bourne was new at the time, the film layers in just enough information so that the thought that this has happened at least once before, successfully, lends a different air of tension to their conversations. The fact that he's killed the taxi driver before twists everything we're seeing. Mann reminds us he's a wild animal, a hunter, a consummate professional and by virtue, a virtuoso, a jazz musician currently on his stage.Mann's evolving use of the digital landscape where I'm sure he flirted with it in Ali, intensifies how personal and different this movie really was. Mann uses digital teasingly, almost mockingly grainy at the start until the true uniqueness of digital is shown in the night shots, the interplay between foreground light and colour, the closeness to the subjects is uncomfortable and apt. The editing and framing creates an uneasy personal tension in a paparazzi-esque manner.The sound mix does this also to mixed-effect; the gunshots and the crashes and the cracking of bones is a palpably shocking, realistic, frightening affair (sort of started a new trend in action flicks after) and the road noise rumble of the cars is lyrical and musical in its own special way, but sometimes the mix swallows dialogue up, or causes the cardinal home movie sin of making the viewier have to adjust volumes between types of scenes. But then most of Mann's movies do this, I think it's just the way he likes it, it does support his style and his choices but it makes for intermittently unenjoyable viewing. His choice of music, however, has the same quality and taste it always does. In this case it's just sumptuous, poppy and jazzy armchair choons.Collateral is a great fusion of a clever script from a good writer taken on a spin by an auteur in a different but equally special way.Also Peter Berg and Mark Ruffalo play cops. That was nice.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great,"Collateral (2004)**** (out of 4)A cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx) picks up a ride (Jada Pinkett Smith) and the two starts chatting on the way to her workplace. Along the way we get to learn a lot about Max but after the young woman gets out, a man named Vincent (Tom Cruise) enters the cab and the rest of the night is full of surprises. Vincent offers Max seven hundred dollars if he'll drive him around for the rest of the night and since this is double what Max usually brings home, he accepts the job. Vincent tells him he has five stops, which is true but what Max doesn't know is that Vincent is a professional killer who has five people to kill before six in the morning.Michael Mann's Collateral certainly isn't anything original and I think you could say a lot of it's routine but the director certainly knows how to tell a story and mix in his whole style that the viewer can throw the unoriginality out the window, sit back and just enjoy the ride. There have been countless films dealing with hit men, their unexpected guests and the police chasing them so in that aspect, Collateral is by the books. However, just like the director's Heat, this film takes the ordinary setup in different directions and adds a layer that we're not use to seeing and in that way, the movie becomes something on its own.You could select one-hundred directors working in Hollywood today and I'd guess at least ninety-eight of them would have turned this movie into a non-stop action film without for a second trying to tell a story. As in the director's previous film Heat, Mann really isn't too interested in all the killings but instead he tries to get into the mind of this cold blooded killer and the hostage he is taking along for the ride. The screenplay by Stuart Beattie is full of wonderful dialogue, which takes us from one killing to the next.After each killing the two men come to terms with their current situation and their actions go from there.Two scenes that really jump out include one where Cruise forces Foxx to go to the hospital and visit his sick mother. How many other action dramas would have taken a time out to do such a thing? Not many but by allowing this scene to take place we get to know more about Cruise and Foxx's characters, which is very important in upcoming scenes. Another scene is in a jazz club where fan Cruise gets to chat with a guy who worked with Miles Davis.Again, the action and suspense built by the director takes a backseat so we can learn more about the two characters and again, this here eventually pays off in later scenes. I won't ruin this second scene for you but it's a rather heartbreaking one that has so much stuff going in it that like the Foxx character, Cruise becomes another object after this.The screenplay is a big key here as is the direction but the real benefit is the two leading actors who turn in some of the best work of their careers. Cruise in my opinion is this generations Paul Newman, an actor who can constantly stay popular and draw in the crowds but at the same time he's not afraid to take on darker subjects. The big buzz surrounding this film is that Cruise would be playing a killer and he pulls that off quite well and for the first time in his career, he actually plays a fairly frightening son of a bitch. Most actors would have constantly been screaming in order to build suspense but Cruise takes the right note by playing everything calm and collective. By playing the role this way the viewer knows very well that this guy means business and knows exactly what he's doing. With this in mind, we don't see the lovable Cruise playing a bad guy but instead we see a rather scary killer doing his job.The real key is Jamie Foxx however, who manages to match Cruise step for step and it will be a shame if the Academy didn't recognize his performance. There's no doubt people will be drawn to this film for Cruise and the story itself could have let the viewer draw sides with Cruise but Foxx is so good in getting every point across that he's able to take the film over and have the viewer rooting for him instead of American's most loved actor. Had Foxx not delivered a top-notch performance than the film would have lost all meaning and the dialogue and story probably would have been thrown in the back seat to Cruise playing the bad guy.The one major flaw with the film occurs at the end when the dialogue is thrown away and we're left with a big chase scene through the subway, which is something done way too many times and nothing new is brought to the story here. The film could have ended in so many different ways that it's a shame we had to go out like this but even with that said, Cruise, Foxx and Mann has created a very special film that should have a long life just like various thrillers from the past. Collateral is the perfect example of a routine story being brought to life by actors doing their job and a director taking the story in different directions.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Thrilling and fun, wonderfully performed by its two leads","In Collateral, Michael Mann - a director who was still working at the top of his game back in 2004 - combines his favourite and familiar traits - an ice-cool soundtrack, buckets of visual style, and a conversational showdown as important as the physical one that inevitably follows. It follows one night in the life of Los Angeles cab driver Max (Jamie Foxx), who after accepting a multi-stop fare from the slick-looking Vincent (Tom Cruise), has his life turned upside down. Vincent looks and sounds like a businessman looking to close multiple deals in the course of a few hours, but when a dead body lands on the top of his cab at the first stop, it becomes clear to Max that Vincent is a hired killer.The two verbally poke and prod each other - Max at Vincent's complete detachment from real-life and the emotional abuse and/or neglect he must have surely suffered to lead him on such a dark path; and Vincent at Max's tendency to procrastinate at every aspect of his life. Max frequently flicks down his sun-visor and stairs at a picture of a desert island, waxing lyrical about his grand plan to set up his own limousine company. At the start of the film, Max drives Justice Department prosecutor Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and the two share a spark. He should ask her for her number but he doesn't. Luckily she takes the initiative and gives it to him anyway. Vincent may be a remorseless psychopath, but at least he grabs life by the balls.Such an engaging character study and a film so packed with marvellously shot set-pieces should lead to an equally great climax, but like Heat (1995), Mann's other L.A.-based crime noir, the film ends on a weak note. Vincent just may be the worst hit-man in cinema history. He's physically capable of taking down multiple foes with fists and weaponry, but his decision-making is laughable at times, and in the end he is forced into a rather bland chase after his prey through a subway. But for the most part, Collateral is thrilling and fun; at it's best when its two leads are simply sitting in the cab and conversing, wonderfully performed by Foxx and Cruise.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A night to remember...,"When this film was shown at the 2004 Venice Film Festival, some critics complained about the fact that it was out of competition, since it was the best picture of those screened that year. They were right. Collateral is a beautiful, stylish, moving film. If it weren't for Clint Eastwood's masterpiece Million Dollar Baby, it would be the best movie of 2004. It's a remarkable achievement, made with expertise and inspiration.The film is set during a night in Los Angeles (the time frame being 9.30 PM - 5.40 AM). We meet a cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx), a man who's been doing that job for twelve years, hoping that sooner or later he'll be able to have enough cash for a project he's pursuing. He's a nice person, willing to take short cuts so that his passengers won't have to pay too much (how many taxi drivers would actually do such a thing?). But after that night, he'll never be the same person. Just after an attractive attorney (Jada Pinkett Smith) has left his vehicle, a new customer shows up. He tells Max he has to make five stops before 6.00 AM, and offers him 600 dollars for the ride. The unsuspecting driver accepts, only to regret his decision minutes later: Vincent (Tom Cruise) is not an ordinary passenger. He's a professional assassin, hired to kill five people and then leave L.A. before anybody notices. And now Max has to help him, whether he likes it or not.The film is directed by Michael Mann, whose other masterwork, Heat, also took place in Los Angeles. In fact, Mann has become to L.A. what Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee and Woody Allen are to New York: he knows every single corner of the city, and by shooting the film on with DV cameras he makes sure the audience gets to see what a beautiful place it is at night. But Mann's genius lies in the fact that he doesn't let the aerial shots of the buildings distract us, but makes them a vital part of his protagonists'journey, which is the core of the movie.The bond that is created between killer and hostage is arguably the best ever dealt with by Mann. If you liked De Niro and Pacino interacting in Heat, you'll be in awe when you witness the confrontation between Max and Vincent. Rarely have we seen two people so radically different: Max has lots of ambition, but won't do anything to even try improving his life. Vincent, on the other hand, is completely uninterested in human life. The only thing he cares about is doing his job perfectly, regardless of why he has to do it (""Should I only kill people I know?"" he asks at a certain point) or what consequences there will be, since in his opinion we're all ultimately insignificant if compared with the rest of the universe. These are two loners who desperately need each other: Vincent depends on Max to get the work done in time, and our cab driver needs his adversary to realize it's time to take action and do something that makes a difference. It's a fascinating relationship, given additional depth by two excellent performances: Cruise is perfectly at his ease playing against type, while Foxx steps out of anonymity with a powerful, compelling, Oscar-worthy effort (he eventually lost out to the equally good Morgan Freeman, who won for the aforementioned Million Dollar Baby).Those who believe in cinema's ability to move as well as entertain should give Collateral a try. It truly stands out as one of the best genre films ever made (shame it wasn't considered for Best Picture of 2004, though).",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cruise control,"Concerns a hired assassin (Cruise) being initially unwittingly ferried to his quarry by taxi driver (Fox) who only becomes aware of his passenger's deeds when a body lands on his bonnet following one such rendezvous. Cruise then retains his chauffeur driven services under duress as he dots around LA on stopover, taking care of business, hit-man style.There's a couple of good fight scenes in which Cruise, playing a silver-haired, Armani-wearing mercenary displays his wu-tang skills (the dancefloor scene is a little reminiscent of ""The Terminator"", though obviously with a more diminutive terminator) on just about anyone foolish enough to go mano-a-mano with the trained killer. Fox is confined in a role that is mostly performed from behind the driver's wheel, albeit with some attempt at establishing a character who is struggling to rise above his job and take a shot at reaching his full potential. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the Government legal eagle impressed by his gab, who becomes his lifeline as his usefulness evaporates.I usually enjoy a Tom Cruise movie about as much as a poke in the eye, but ""Collateral"" isn't as bothersome as those others; he's still irritatingly self absorbed (in-character), but the film has an undeniable attraction even if the ending is a shallow attempt at pathos. Some hard-hitting action, maybe worth a look.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A first-rate thriller all the way.,"This film has opened up new paths for many. The two biggest paths opened up are those for lead actors Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, who both give outstanding performances and should get similar roles in the future. AS for the film itself, this is suspense at its finest art form. It opens up simple, with very little action and lots of close-ups to get familiar with the surroundings. Then, the characters meet. Vincent (Cruise), is a killer hired to make five stops in one night, so he hires Max (Foxx), a cab driver to chauffeur him around Los Angeles until 6 am. You would think that nothing too outrageous will happen, but eventually Max finds out Vincent's line of work and the police are on their trail as well.This is a terrific film, filled with exceptional performances, excellent writing, and marvelous directing by Michael Mann that holds us in suspense just long enough to finish the story, but not too long that we begin to not care. All elements come together to make this a first-rate thriller in every way. The ending is satisfying and the scenes leading up to it are heart-pounding. See this film if only for the mesmerizing performance by Tom Cruise. Cold, ruthless, and completely lost in his work, this performance is one of the very best in modern movies. For that matter, this whole film is one of the best of the decade.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good, but not THAT Good","Finally watched this movie after putting it off for years. I went in with high expectations knowing that it was nominated for 2 Oscars (and I'm a sucker for Tom Cruise movies). It was fine.Some decent acting by Foxx and Cruise, some overacting by Ruffalo, and some good (I guess?) editing just about sum up the film. Cruise's character (and Foxx's if I'm being honest) is nothing you haven't seen before and the end of the movie is all too familiar. It's a slightly above-average film and worth watching, but you should temper your expectations. Oscar-worthy cinema has come a long way since 2004.Verdict: Watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Ultra cool crime thriller,It has to be Tom Cruise's best film as far as I've seen them. The film has an amazing story about a contract killer with a hit list in his laptop and is using a taxi driver for his destinations. Casting was great Tom Cruise was the best and Jamie Fox was not really that good but he could of been much better. The atmosphere is terrific which suits the tensive mood for the movie and it seems like that it's really happening. The best scene is when they where in the nightclub and the song Ready Steady Go was on. I've also seen the Indian remake called The Killer that was also good in it's own place and the actor who played the taxi driver was a lot better than Jamie Fox. If there were going to be a sequel Collateral 2 then it would be good idea if Jason Statham were the bad guy. Overall I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 because I did not really like Jamie Fox otherwise I would of given it a 10 out of 10 if some other good actor was the taxi driver like Collin Farrell.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Ruffalo's performance is noteworthy and there's nice cameo's from Jason Statham and Peter W. Berg. Smith proves she's not just beautiful but is also a fantastic actress.

His portrayal of the hit-man Vincent is outstanding.Director Michael Mann with a Viper FilmStream High-Definition Camera (first such use in a major motion picture) captures the cool Californian night.

Good and entertaining but heavily flawed - Mann's direction is the highlight,"""I'm just Collateral."" Max (Jamie Foxx) has had a long run as a taxi cab driver in the less savory areas of Los Angeles for longer than he ever wanted or imagined. Almost oblivious to the amount of time he has dedicated to his job, Max has reached a state of denial  every passenger who enters his cab seems to receive a lecture on how it's ""just part-time"", serving as a means of cash until he is able to pursue his long-time dream job: Opening a limo service.Max's dreams come to a startling close on the fateful night that Vincent (Tom Cruise), a cool, calculating gray-haired assassin, enters his cab. Vincent is in town to kill five people, all in one night. Max is his personal driver. For $600, and held at gunpoint, Max is forced to carry Vincent from one destination to the next.""Collateral"" is a terribly unrealistic motion picture  but it is not terrible. In fact, it's quite good. Despite its flaws (and it has its fair share) it manages to maintain a hard edge and hold the audience's interest in the face of utter absurdity. Vincent, like the Rutger Hauer character from ""The Hitcher,"" seems to be some unattainable wise guy who knows everything that is going to happen, is happening, and has happened. The movie stretches its limits of believability when Vincent visits Max's ill mother in hospital. Also, when Vincent takes the time to wander into a jazz club and talk to his victim for a half hour before killing him  in front of Max. It's just a bit too silly for such an otherwise realistic picture, and this also leads one to question Max's motives  through all of this all he does is whine and try to run away a few times, but he never at any point attempts to truly stop Vincent -- until he finds out that the last victim happens to be the woman Max is falling in love with. (What a coincidence!) So, either Max is incredibly stupid or he's incredibly selfish and uncaring. I hope it's the former.Also, considering the fact that Vincent is a professional veteran hit-man, he doesn't seem too worried about leaving fingerprints, witnesses or other evidential materials behind. He's sloppy and careless. He enters a nightclub armed with a handgun and shoots a handful of men in a crowd of at least a hundred. One must wonder why, in eight years, Vincent has not been identified by police. There are video cameras that capture his presence, but we are led to believe no one has any idea who he is. Despite the fact that we are also led to believe that he's killed hundreds, if not thousands of people in his eight years as an assassin.Then there's the plot, which is ridiculous. I highly doubt a hit-man would use a taxi cab driver as Vincent does  even as collateral. It's beyond belief, and I am willing to give scenes in ""Commando"" benefit of the doubt.Then again I do think the film isn't supposed to be taken at face value. It is a bit of a moralistic tale told with metaphors and philosophical monologues. ""One day you wake up and it's gone,"" Vincent states in regards to life. ""Collateral"" is less about reality and more about appreciating life.In the end neither of the lead actors really manage to light up the screen. Cruise is cool and brutal but little else. His motivations are not clear and he comes across as being quite stupid rather than clever. Foxx is good but as I said above, his character's motivations are a bit dubious. He's a bit too willing to drive around being friends and talking to a hit-man all night. I find fault in the script  it's a nice idea but absurdly childish in execution. ""Collateral"" does not take place in an adult world  it takes place in a world where people perform acts in order to help along the script.The real showcase of this film is Michael Mann, who once again proves that he can take fairly obvious ideas and really make them exciting and even seem unique to a certain extent (also see the superior ""Heat"" from 1995). He captures the essence of a dark, grainy LA night perfectly with use of digital cameras and rear projections. Also, he proves here that he's capable of directing intense action  the climax of the movie is stupid and clichéd and runs itself into a wall (it's way too ambiguous for its own good as a thriller) but Mann handles it like an epic and all in all the audience walks away from ""Collateral"" thinking it's a lot better than it probably is.I liked this movie a lot, I purchased the DVD and I think multiple viewings will only improve it, but it is by no means Mann's best film and in comparison to ""Heat"" it seems quite poor. My review seems to be a heavy criticism  I am merely pointing out the things I disliked. Considering it runs two hours long, and these are my only major complaints, I think it's safe to say that ""Collateral"" has more plusses than minuses.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Miami Vice meets Tom Cruse via Hitchcock,"The story is very strong, and has the Michael Mann ""You belong to the city"" feel for it.  Tom Cruse is the lesser of two lead actors in order to fit the role of Vincent.  Tom, if I can call him that like I really know him, is a high mileage actor.  Tom is good at his trade, but after using up similar characters over the years needed to re-invent the Tom Cruse persona.  Maybe, next movie one might see an even darker Tom; (AKA a Nazi in a war movie, or as a evil spirit in a haunted house)only Tom will know.  ""Collateral"" has a Miami Vice or Heat feel that mixes a Alf Hichcock story with plot twists to it.  A great date movie, when I was 17 or 21 and dating say my wife, as the girl friend of course, this movie would be great.  Too be fair I need to watch this movie another time to give it a accurate rating, but I would tell everyone to go see it at the Drive In or Theater before Collateral is ready for on demand or DVD rental.  7 or 8 out of 10.

I Keep on Dancin',"Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Michael Mann became famous for his work on ""Miami Vice"" in the 80's and has had his ups (""The Insider"" ""Manhunter"" ""Thief"") and downs (""Heat"" ""Ali"") as a feature film director. ""Colateral"" is a mixed bag of both.  Casting usually good guy Tom Cruise as the souless hit man is what provides the initial interest in this film and Cruise does a fine job in this new territory.  Couldn't help but mentally write the script with this Vince as a grown-up Vince from ""The Color of Money"".  Of course, the playfulness has been replaced by ice water in the veins.  As with many movies these days, the script comes up short and prevents this from being what it hinted at being.  The best scene is the taxi cab banter between Jamie Foxx and Mrs. Will Smith.  You sense that they could really help each other learn to live life.  Foxx does an admirable job as the whipped, day-dreaming, somewhat scared of life part-time for 12 years cab driver.  He has the gift of gab for the fares and really risks nothing in his everyday life.  Everything changes one night when he accepts Cruise as a passenger and accidently discovers (with a bang) the mission this real estate professional is really on.  The most absurd scene is the nightclub scene where guns are blaring, fights are everywhere and the dancers keep dancing.  What kind of capture and rescue plan was this anyway?  Was it possible to put any more civilians at risk?  Anyway, the screenplay is way too loose and is just plain awful towards the end.  Despite the flaws, it is a very watchable film and interesting because of the Cruise character.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
More of a drama than an action thriller,"Not to be mistaken for Governor Schwartzenegger's 2002 film 'Collateral Damage', Michael Mann, one of the finest modern crime directors takes his latest shootout down a quite different path. To quote the movie's tagline: ""It began like any other night"". Max (Foxx) is a peaceful, even tempered L.A. cabbie who is hired by a mysterious man named Vincent (Cruise) for the night to make five stops. After a body flies from a 3rd story window and lands on Max's cab, it becomes apparent that Vincent is no ordinary passenger. In truth, Vincent is a contract hit-man who has five witnesses to a drug bust to eradicate, and one night to do it. The rest of the film follows him carrying out his five hits, Max's constant attempts to escape, and the police officer tracking them down. (Ruffalo)Collateral is impressive by it's balance between more typical action violence and excitement and the perspectives of the characters. Vincent seems to be the personification of all good parent and teacher's beliefs that all bullies are unsure of themselves, and push others around to improve their self esteem. This becomes quite clear, as Vincent is openly aggressive in conversation with Max, forces him to visit his mother in the hospital, and drags him into a jazz club, forcing him to tell his interpretation of the music. When Max begins to question Vincent about his reasons for becoming a hit-man, Vincent becomes verbally abusive, and threatens to kill him on the spot. But Vincent also becomes surprisingly philosophical, musing about the reasons behind the crime and corruption in Las Angelos. Wonderful jobs all around for making Vincent a human being instead of a heartless killing machine.Tom Cruise continues to diversify his recent film roles as he dominates the screen as cold, intense hit man Vincent, playing the role to utter perfection. Foxx also continually impresses as his unfortunate victim Max, and a strong supporting cast is supplied from Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo.One of the most visually impressive films of the year, Collateral was filmed almost entirely with a digital camera to provide a more gritty look. The effort payed off, and Mann pushes the limit between a realistic and fantastical look with the canvas of dulled purples and blues that is his vision of L.A. at night. The frequent overhead shots and Michael Mann trademark constantly changing camera angles also help to embellish the visuals, with a highly satisfying result.A good story, masterfully helmed by a great director, combined with some stellar acting and strong characterizations proves to be a winner. If you aren't deterred by violence and some strong language, I would strongly recommend seeing Collateral.-9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Oozing coolness, Mann maintains focus mostly","This movie has coolness dripping off it. It is well shot, expertly edited and the performances are good. The film starts slowly introducing only the characters it needs. The movie has very little fat from a narrative point of view. ""Collateral""  builds to a better climax than Mann's earlier L.A. Story ""Heat"". The tension level is established early but the stakes continue to rise. In another director's hands it would quickly become preposterous, but a stable and focused approach keeps the suspension of disbelief at acceptable levels. I think many scenes were shot on HD video. Foxx shows a good range and doesn't overplay his part. Cruise is, well Cruise. It's nice to see him play the bad guy. But he isn't strictly a traditional heavy. In the movie he is a sort of anti-villain, seemingly a devil/angel on the shoulder of Foxx. Similar to DeNiro in ""Heat""You don't really root against him except when it comes to the main conflict between he and the protagonist, Foxx.One of the main characters of this film is Los Angeles, and Mann doesn't skimp on the cheesecloth while showing the city. He must truly love the city of Los Angeles, because through his lens it looks loads better than it really does. I can understand his love of roads, freeways, and the mechanical and stark look of a city at night because I share it.A modern city is a wonder of the world. It is a testament to the combined wills of millions of people. The way it looks and lives tells us much about it's residents.

"What I like and dislike about ""Collateral"" (2004)","What I like about the movie:Michael Mann loves Los Angeles and it shows  the nighttime LA is one of the film's true stars and director uses quite a few helicopter shots to show it's beauty and magnificence. Film looks and sounds great  Mann is known for the great soundtracks in his films.Beginning of the movie was promising: Before Vincent (a hit man with five targets) hops in the cab; Max (the cabbie who gets hired by Vincent for the night) picks up Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith). They talk about their lives, their dreams. He guesses quiet accurately what she does for living; he's got good observation skills and sense of humor. The chemistry between Foxx and Pinkett Smith is undeniable.Cruise and Foxx both act wonderfully in the movie. I actually went to see it because I wanted to see Cruise as a ruthless bad guy who made killing people his full time job. Both, Cruise and Foxx play against their types, and it works for both of them.There's one splendid supporting role - a jazz club owner played by Barry Shabaka Henley. The scene between him and Cruise is, IMO, the best on in the move.What I did not like:Where this film fails miserably is in its plotting  too many coincidences, and the movie relies on them too much. I guessed the end of the movie after first ten minutes  and it was correct.There's an absurd nightclub sequence when people keep dancing even when the whole hell turned loose. Nothing would stop them from dancing, not even gunfire and dead bodies next to them.The ending also belongs to the much inferior movie  with obligatory cell phone go low on battery. Cruise character's determination which is more like obsession brings to memory the crazy Nazi character played by Malcolm McDowell in The Passage (1979)  and that's not the best territory to dwell.Overall, it was a disappointment  the movie that I wanted to like by director whom I admire with Tom Cruise playing against his type.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Still the film starts off in an airport with two men exchanging brief cases and this is what most of the film is around what is contained within that, in the next seen we meet Max an average cab driver who is played by the excellent Jamie Foxx, now as the tag of the film suggests it starts like any other night.After 15 minutes of not much happening the film suddenly moves into a world of it's own, as Max drops off a woman, who hes clearly pulled, by the name of Annie who is played by Jada Pinkett Smith (one of the only decent people in the Matrix sequels) still after dropping her off he meets Vincent who is played by Tom Cruise who just happens to be a contract killer who has to make several stops and a get away...who just happens to be Max.There are loads of excellent moments in the film when Jammie and Tom have some really good lines off each other, also some of the scenes in which Tom does go into his own and typical action hero he does it as amazing as always, such as the scene when he has to get back his brief case from some ""homies"".There is enough to keep you watching it and the ending is truly amazing, at some points however you do get abit ""x y z"" about the directing but nothing too bad and not as bad as in Manns next film Miami Vice which looked as if it was filmed for an A level media project. But the style of which he uses for this film works such as the shots in the car from PoV and the shots he uses of the fox...it just shows a whole other side to LA.However there is nothing really bad about this film it is after all what it was meant to be a high action thriller, there are some typical shoots in places but some really excellent ones such as the nightclub scene which Mann tried to copy at the opening of Miami but failed on so many levels its unreal.If you want to see a truly good film this this probably isn't for you since it's not the best but if you do however want to watch a film with a simple story and which has simple characters and is set mostly in a cab then this film is for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Plot, Acting, Directing, Top Notch!!","Collateral is without a doubt one of the best films to come out in recent years. Not only does it feature a stellar cast and crew, but a prominent soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, and a knock out story that is not only unique, but believable and realistic.Tom Cruise is in top form as Vincent, a contract killer sent to LA to kill four people involved in a drug bust. Cruise delivers one of the best performances of his career, bringing a certain coldness to his character: A man who has no compassion or mercy for human life, making him seemingly robotic and non human. Every move Vincent makes, whether it's holding a gun, or having conversations with Max, he is always in control, aware of his surroundings. Cruise becomes Vincent, the boyish charm hidden by a stony exterior.Which brings us to Jamie Foxx, breaking from his well known comedic skills to try his hand at a drama, and how nicely he succeeds. Foxx is the standout in this film, bringing a vulnerability yet a strong willingness to survive to his character Max, a man who before meeting Vincent lets people walk all over him. Yet over the course of one night, through his interactions with Vincent, he gains the courage to stand up for himself, to do what he believes to be right. His conversations with Vincent awaken him to the kind of life he is currently living, and that he can be so much more than what he had become.The story to this film is never slow, always picking up the pace and keeping the viewer involved in what is happening on screen. The score and music choices to the film do not take away from it, but rather enhance it, creating a mood that is calming and soothing at times, and tense and suspenseful at others times. Not to mention, the cinematography, seeing LA at night is a beauty all in itself, to see the city at night is a wonder and a privlage.Collateral, directed by Micheal Mann, is one of the best films to come out in recent years. Both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx give outstanding performances to characters who each give something to the other: Vincent is ever slightly humanized, and Max is given more confidence in himself. The story of a hit man is given a fresh spin with this film, one the boasts beautiful cinematography, and an outstanding story. Highly recommended.MJR",,Anonymous,Crime
Grade A thriller,Top notch performances. Cruise shines! Having Los Angeles as a character is compelling. Great movie!,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A slick & mature thriller.,"From director Michael Mann comes ""Collateral"", the single night story of a hit-man and a taxi driver, who serves as both hostage and chauffeur. The film is highly reminiscent of ""Heat"", also helmed by Mann. Fortunately Mann learned from some of his earlier mistakes, crafting a tighter, more personal picture.The film is rife with Mann's touches, ranging from hues to cues. Set in urban Los Angeles, the lighting and locations effectively reflect the multi-ethnic night scene, as the entire movie is infused with a blue tint (see: ""Heat"", ""The Insider""), adding to the Mann's usual mellow yet driving feel that aids in distinguishing ""Collateral"" from most cinema. The soundtrack features the fully competent music of James Newton Howard (""Unbreakable""), but the other musical choices are the highlights. Utilizing jazz to classical, as well as the usual dramatic score, the music lounges well in the background, providing a truly appropriate soundtrack to scenes that range from quiet dialogue to brutal action.Through that variety of scenes, ""Collateral"" develops characters and story in a parallel manner rather than opt for the common needlessly breakneck stories that substitute action for plot and character depth. After a well-paced introduction accompanied by classical music, Vincent (Tom Cruise) hops into the taxi of Max (Jaime Foxx). One stop later, as the music kicks it in gear, the game is afoot. The two progress through Vincent's list of terror, and they get to know each other. Instead of defining the characters with an opening sequence or two, then hurling them into a chaotic series of events, ""Collateral"" develops both Vincent and Max to the very last scene. The audience learns about both Vincent and Max as the duo learns about each other, resulting in a compelling, Heat-esque battle of wills between the characters and a viewer's decision about whom to root for.Given the characters' professions, that choice may seem easy, but for at least two reasons, a legitimate dilemma exists. First of all, it's Tom Cruise, here playing an atypical role for him; plus his Vincent is not a traditional baddie. An evil man, yes, but one who convincingly believes his profession is no different than any other; he sincerely thinks he is doing right. As Hitler proved (pardon the extreme comparison), these are the most dangerous type of evil people, because they possess no remorse and no hesitation. In ""Collateral"" such an antihero interacts crisply with Jaimie Foxx's character. As Vincent's foil, Max is far from a normal protagonist, and Foxx plays him unexpectedly well as a day-dreaming, underachieving hack stuck in the same rut for a dozen years. With the character traits of the hero and antagonist switched thusly, the story confuses rooting interests yet engages the mind, dragging a willing audience along for an introspective roller-coaster.In more than one sense, the simple plot brings to mind last year's ""Phone Booth"", in that the morally questionable main characters are largely confined to a small space, and the pic is basically a mano-a-mano experience. But while ""Phone Booth"" had Colin Farrell battling an unseen threat, Mann blatantly presents the opposing forces, whether they be physical or mental obstacles. This is a more difficult conflict to express well, but ""Collateral"" successfully presents the strife, thanks to superb performances from cast and crew. But despite their noblest efforts, a total lack of redeeming character values does fetter the film from fulfilling a greater glory.Over the last twenty minutes, ""Collateral"" unfortunately but unsurprisingly lapses into convention but still serves as a thinking man's thriller. You won't find mindless entertainment like ""S.W.A.T."" here, but something akin to Michael Mann's previous work, in a more compact package.Bottom Line: Very enjoyable, and a good change of pace from summer tripe. A low 8 of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A movie worth the ticket,the film is beautifully photographed and edited (LA never looked better at night)but the script takes too many dramatic licenses-sometimes the film is incomprehensible-Tom Cruise looks good and acts well in a different kind of image (other good alternatives as a hit man would have been Nicholas cage or Alec Baldwin)-perhaps the producers forced the director to submit to the demands of the box office and end the film as it is(compare to the classic James Cagney gangster movies of the past which still continue to haunt us)-nevertheless Michael Mann is a brilliant technician and imaginative director who is sure to hit the bull's eye with a tighter script.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Totally awesome film,"The Bourne Supremacy, The Day After Tomorrow, Spider Man 2, Million Dollar Baby, The Aviator, Ray, I, Robot, what's next? Oh yeah, Collateral, one of the best action films ever.It stars Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Mark Ruffalo, Jada Pinkett Smith, Javier Bardem, etc.For Max (Jamie Foxx), the dreams of his own limo company are what keep him afloat from the mundane reminder of his real job: taxi driver, which he has been doing for over a decade. But one fateful night, Max has one cab fare that he would never expect named Vincent (Tom Cruise). He's a smooth, charismatic fellow who is sharply dressed and apparently wealthy, offering Max an excellent tip if he'll bring him to five stops throughout Los Angeles. But fate intervenes and Max soon finds out that Vincent isn't a businessman, but a contract hit-man making his rounds. As the night progresses, Max finds himself under the microscope of a coldblooded killer. Meanwhile, the police and FBI are onto Max's cab while the two ultimately play a psychological cat and mouse game, that will lead to an inevitable climax neither would anticipate.Cruise and Foxx played their roles very well, the film was also violent and very exhilarating, especially the taxi cab barrel roll flip, and the night club fight.Collateral is one to check out, you won't be disappointed.Collateral gets 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good But Far Fetched!,"Michael Mann does L.A. better than any director. And, so being intrigued by the city as I am, I enjoy his L.A.-set movies. ""Heat,"" of course, is great! He returns with ""Collateral."" The complex and fascinating character interactions of ""Heat"" are here replaced by a fairly routine thriller.It is good, but demands too much suspension of disbelief. There are just WAY too many coincidence here! You are okay with them for a while, but as the film goes on, it does get to be a bit much.Otherwise, Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, except with graying hair! Personally, almost whenever I see Tom Cruise, that is who I see. I have a difficult time buying most of his characters. Same goes with some other stars like Ben Affleck or Robert Redford. I do buy Cruise more as a villain than I have John Travolta, someone I also have a tough time buying as the characters he plays.Mann experimented with early digital cinematography here, and I personally didn't care for it.

Cruise's only ever portrayal of a villain in his entire career,"First plot-hole: A professional hitman or professional assassin would ALWAYS have a silencer on his gun, so that's the first major plot-hole in the movie... it makes no sense that a professional would want to attract unneeded attention to themselves... and in the movie, the fact that he DOESN'T have a silencer does indeed end-up in him getting noticedAfter that the movie progresses fine but later on another plot-hole appears due to Tom Cruise's character not wearing a seatbelt and not making Jamie Foxx's character stop the car... he could EASILY have made him stop the car (like by hitting him in the head with his gun), yet he didn't and that created a plot-hole... a massive plot-hole in fact, which changed the course of the entire movie.Overall it's an interesting movie and it's an important film because it's the first (and only) time ever that Tom Cruise played the bad guy (Tropic Thunder doesn't count because he was a supporting character only and he wasn't a bad guy either, he was just a corporate a$shole). Who knows if he will EVER do another movie as the villain? It's been 16 years and he hasn't done it again, so my guess is not... so until then, this movie will stand as a testament to Cruise's ability to play an evil character.

"Mann's Best Since ""Heat""","First, I think ""Heat"" is one of the greatest movies of the last 20 years. If you disagree, then any arguement I make here is not going to change your mind.  Technically and emotionally, ""Collateral"" and ""Heat"" were spot-on, but if you really think ""XXX"" is the pinnacle of cinematic achievement, then there's nothing to be done for you.""Collateral"" is beautifully shot, acted, and edited.  Michael Mann goes beyond what's on the page, creating a vivid and dark Los Angeles-- and ditto on the performances from his actors, as he shows little subtleties of character, with a look here, a twitching jawline there.  It was the subtlety that I loved, and will make me go back to watch it again as a character study, not just the action movie I walked in expecting (and still got, by the way).I felt like I'd BEEN to L.A. after watching this movie, something which ""Bourne Supremacy"" couldn't make work for its numerous locations.  During action sequences in ""Collateral,"" Mann is very careful to make sure the camera lingers on the key events, letting you SEE the action-- shooting his actors full frame when necessary, rather than just waist-up or with a shaky steadicam.At its heart, this is an action movie... but one based around character, not on blowing up the next set piece.  The ending was a little abrupt, but it's about the journey, not the destination.  Completely worth a second look, something so few of 2004 releases can say.",,Anonymous,Crime

Collateral is one of the greatest crime dramas ever made,"""A Guy gets on the MTA here in L.A. and dies. Think anybody will notice?""A nearly flawless fast paced thriller/crime drama, layered with themes of ethical subjectivity and what a man and his dreams mean. Collateral takes you on a night time journey with two completely opposite characters. A Hitman played Brilliantly by Tom Cruise and A modest Taxi driver who lives his life hoping to one day accomplish his dreams played by Jamie Fox. Despite them being complete opposites you can't help but root for both of them as the audience. Collateral has some of the most amazing long sequences of two them just having a conversation about why both of them are the way they are. About what makes a man kill, about what makes a man so unwilling to act and accomplish his dream. (That part is quite easily my favorite part of the film)
There aren't many action scenes but when with the few that are present in the film are raw and adrenaline fueled, with some of the best sound design and gunshot ""sounds"" you can't help but flinch every time a gun is fired.
Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox lead this crime drama and under the surface a story about nihilistic beliefs and the dissection of the human subconsciousness brilliantly. The only gripe i have with the film is the unnecessary vague ending leaving many questions left about Max (not in a good way)

Near Perfect L.A. Crime Story,"Watching Michael Mann's ""Collateral"" gave me some of the same feelings I had when first watching David Lynch's ""Mullholand Drive.""  Yes, Mann may go astray and deliver us a ""Last of the Mohicans"" or ""Ali"" every once in awhile (just as Lynch gives us the rare ""Elephant Man"" or ""Straight Story"") but let's face it, he's a niche director, and Mann's niche is crime stories, particularly ones taking place in Los Angeles.  David Lynch is best at directing David Lynch movies and Michael Mann is best at directing crime thrillers in the city of angels.So, here we have a director basking in the glory of what he does best (I loved the lighting, the cityscapes, the eclectic music choices, the camera angles, and even the digital photography which for the first time in my book was put to appropriate and artistic use here).  We also have the biggest movie star on the planet, Tom Cruise, relishing in a chance to go against type and play a ruthless, yet somehow endearing hit-man.  And thirdly we have a star-making turn from Jamie Foxx as the not so hapless cabbie who has the misfortune of picking up Cruise's fare, also going against type and excelling in a dramatic performance when so many people know him only from his comedic turns.  It's so rare to get such a trifecta out of a movie, and to top it off we have Jada Pinkett-Smith as a lawyer looking more stunning and beautiful than she ever has and sparking some genuine chemistry with Foxx.  Yes, it gets a bit predictable in the end, and it might not be the epic that Mann's ""Heat"" was, but along the way we get treated to the best choreographed shoot-out in recent memory, some genuine chemistry amongst big stars, thoughtful dialogue, and classy suspense.  All in all, it was the best time I had at the movies this summer.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Interesting; One of the greatest films of the year, and one of the best roles for cruise.","Collateral Opens with Vincent, played by Tom Cruise, as an already mysterious man. He makes an obviously fake exchange of briefcases with Jason Stratman, who pops into the movie as a quick cameo. Although you've seen this type of exchange before, you know that it's going to be a great movie. it cuts to the chase immediately. No lolly gagging, just ""Shoot Cruise getting his materials"". and that is how Cruise is established in the movie.We come to Jamie Foxx and get to know him, since we already have a good feeling who Cruise is. Foxx plays Max, a cabbie who dreams of making a very exclusive and terrific limousine company. He gets his last fare just before He picks up the mysterious Cruise. The fare, who is Jada Pinkett Smith, gets to know her driver and they both gain an attraction.Pinkett gets dropped off.Max picks up Vincent. it starts like any other night for Max.Vincent is revealed through the film as a contract killer who has five stops to make and doesn't intend on letting Max escape him. The fewer people who see and get to know Vincent, the better. Add a team of cops who are pursuing the answers to the murders, and you've got yourself one hell of an interesting and intelligent suspense film.Cruise has been getting a lot of hype for his performance as Vincent. I couldn't agree more with all the positive comments because he is quite simply astounding. You can't tell that the guy playing Vincent was once the guy who played Nice Guy Jerry Maguire, or dumb but cool pilot Maverick from Top Gun. The Guy you see playing Vincent would strike you as a guy who actually kills people for a living because he is right on the ball in his performance.As the film progresses, we learn more about why Vincent has the line of work and how he could possibly look at all the violence and all the bloodshed as another day at the office. He's a sinister character with a disturbing set of personalities to his name. And when you get used to one of those personalities, he suddenly breaks out of it and becomes the killer.I think that Cruise could get an oscar nomination, if not an oscar win. He is so good and so interesting to watch you just feel that he deserves all the positive comments in the world.Now, I can tell you that this great character has been placed in one of the best films of the year. The plot is consistently interesting and always has you wondering if someones going to do this action or that. Even the cops are interesting to watch as they try and figure out whose killing all these people. Overall, once you see Vincent get that briefcase in the beginning there is always a sense of suspense in the air.****/****",,Anonymous,Crime
1/2 character drama + 1/2 action film = Engaging but messy film,"""Collateral"" isn't a bad film by any means, but it's a somewhat unfocused, messy film and that holds back a terribly interesting concept and some very good acting, keeping the film only a decent one. The opening of the film is very slow and drawn out, showing us that our hero (and make no mistake about it, Foxx is the star and hero) is a clean freak cab driver and something of a dreamer. However, despite the character development involved, this is perhaps the worst part of the film because it has little to do with the coming plot and it's extremely slow--several passages like this will follow, interrupting an interesting film that has some thrilling action bits as well as one fascinating character (Vincent, the contract killer, played by Tom Cruise) and a wonderful character arc for its protagonist as he, despite his fear of the other man, is affected positively by him.The acting, needless to say, is excellent. Jamie Foxx has quickly become one of the most respected young actors in Hollywood and this film shows why, and it also reminds us of the talent Tom Cruise has--able to be cunning, frightening, professional, and above all charismatic. Many have forgotten that Cruise's first film role was an evil, crazed young military student in ""Taps,"" but here we can again see how his unmatched charisma can be so effective in a ""bad guy"" role. To get back to Foxx, he has a difficult, varying role and manages to play every emotion from absolute fear to rage to annoyance perfectly.Michael Mann's direction is strong, always keeping the focus where it needs to be--on the wonderful characters being acted so well--and keeps the entire film attractive. He also does a wonderful job of not going out of his way to draw our attention to small details that we do need to notice but still allowing us to see them. It's something like watching a stage play in that it's up to the viewer to pay attention and see these effects, which I always enjoy and which gives the film rewatchability (I think I may just have invented that word, but hopeful everyone can discern its intended meaning) on par with just about any film.Overall, ""Collateral"" is a somewhat unfocused film that could have been absolutely fascinating and despite the mess still contains excellent acting and wonderful direction. It's certainly worth a watch but it's still a flawed screenplay that needed some quick reworking to make it work and let's face it--a bad screenplay can't make a good film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Very good thriller, and superbly shot with the ever present Mann trademarks. Well worth watching.","very well filmed thriller from Michael Mann who once again proves his mastery of Directing, with Tom Cruise being equalled for performance alongside Jamie Foxx. Cruise shows how good he is at portraying a bad guy, just as much as his good guy roles, if not better.The film starts off low key, and continues for the majority. Despite Vincent being a cold hired killer, his demeanour and relaxed, open attitude makes you feel that he's not that dangerous after all. At some point along the way I started wondering where this was going, I knew Cruise can play a great bad guy, but he wasn't really playing much at all, just any other character. Then I caught some of the subtleties of the character and the way he was calming and controlling Max.What was then interesting was where it went from there, where the story kicked off into high gear and the characters changed under the pressure of the night. There's even a growing understanding between the characters before the final sequences.Excellent action scenes and superb camera work with a fantastic score edited into the scenes adding another layer of tension and storytelling.Imagine a straight line through the centre of the plot showing predictability, this story follows that path, but instead of a straight line it curves back and forth crossing it throughout but always keeping that steer. So what you find is you expect something to happen and it does, just not at the time or in the way you thought, it's always just slightly off centre. That makes it interesting, and although there is predictability, it doesn't detract one bit from the movie or it's style.Let's face it Mann is about style and atmosphere, with a great score and some fantastic action sequences (check out the club scene), and this delivers. On top of that are the slower paced, low key scenes from the beginning which provide a great level of realism and character sympathies while setting the plot devices clearly in front of you.Very good thriller, and superbly shot with the ever present Mann trademarks. Well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Collateral: 6/10,"There's nothing better than going into a movie you thought would be bad and walking out pleasantly surprised. There's nothing worse than going into a movie you expect to be great and come out with a feeling of mediocrity. The latter is how I felt about Collateral (not to be confused with the Schwarzenegger Collateral Damage), one of the movies for which I was most excited in the summer. Both of the trailers looked great, with them seeming dark and being an action film with a dramatic overtone. Instead, we get a film that has its moments, but just doesn't know what to be. Is it a drama? Is it an action movie? Is it a comedy? I don't agree with the third, but everyone in the test audience was cracking up like crazy. I doubt that that's a great sign for a movie like this.Max (Jamie Foxx) is a cab driver stuck in a rut. He picks up a woman (Jada Pinkett Smith) in his cab, and gets her phone number. It started like any other night. Then Vincent (Tom Cruise) enters the cab and pays him off to drive around to five different locations for ""real estate"" deals. When a body falls onto Max's cab, however, it seems that Vincent is going around killing people, as he's a contract killer. Max then has to go along with Vincent, because it's good to have a good argument, but better to have a good argument with a gun in your hand.I didn't know whether Collateral would be a thriller, an action, or a drama, but I was prepared for any. What I got was an uneasy combination of the three. The movie begins in a somber way-something that a good drama could have cone out of. There's a few action scenes thrown in (they're actually pretty cool-they'd be better if this was actually an action movie), and the music was so unbearable loud you'd think it was a thriller. I mean it, the music (by James Newton Howard) was so obnoxious and it played the emotions so much that it is the one factor that ruined the film for me. For example, Max calls Annie (Smith) on a cell phone, and I was literally about to yell out to the screen that she wouldn't be able to hear him talk because the music was so loud. What was Michael Mann thinking?Speaking of Mann, he does a great directing job here. He chooses a unique style, which isn't always good (like Man on Fire), but here it works. He keeps only a small amount of the screen in focus by using a telephoto lens, which really emphasizes the characters, which are both well developed. The cinematography in general was very good, with quite a few helicopter shots, and the whole thing's pretty steady for what looked like to be a hand-held camera. Although the quick cuts were necessary in the action scenes, they weren't overdone, which I felt thankful for. Everything technical looked very deliberate-and I can only attribute that to Mann. Although he won't be, it would be great to see him nominated for Best Director. He wasn't the one responsible for the uneven script, but he did make it constantly interesting. At times, it's interesting but unexciting, then it's interesting and exciting, then it's interesting and boring. At least it's always interesting.Foxx, best known for his roles in stupid comedies (except 2001's Ali, also directed by Mann), really proves himself here. He puts in an outstanding acting job here, alienating himself from his previous, fluff roles. Cruise seems to be paychecking his way through, although, since he's a generally good actor, he does a good job. Although the movie overstays its two hour welcome (the ending seemed especially drawn out and clichéd (that's just not possible), Collateral is a different film, to say the least. It's a combination of genres, but, unlike, say, Donnie Darko, it doesn't work that well like that.My rating: 6/10Rated R for violence and language.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tom Cruise at his best!,This has to be hands down one of if not the best performance by Cruise. In many of his films he is nothing special but this oe he certainly stands out as the star and with a strong supporting role from Jamie Fox this movie turned out great. It had a new intriguing story line and solid direction and dialouge.This movie is about a cab driver who one night picks up a nicely dressed man. This man pays him well and makes him take him all over town little does the cab driver know this man is actually a hit-man and he is driving him to kill people.This movie was really good and with just two main actors there is no bad side actors to screw up the movie. This is a very intense thriller and everybody should watch it,8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Slick, empty -- much like the lead actor.","I knew *Collateral* wouldn't really be good, but I was a big fan of Michael Mann's *Heat*, one of the great crime films of the Nineties. I admit to a sort of fondness for Mann's portentous, slick style, even though such fondness is really against my better critical judgment. *Collateral* does have the typically operatic moments we associate with Mann's work: the slow sweep of the police copters over the throbbing neon of downtown L.A.; the sleazy decadence of your average industrial-beat-thumping nightclub; the macho professionalism of the cops and their drug-lord antagonists (even though the latter resort to telling threatening stories about Mexican Santa Clauses who leave little toy burros on the windowsills of naughty Mexican kids [don't ask -- it ain't worth it]). . . . Occasionally, the picture has that Mann shimmer to it, especially at the end, when a cobalt-blue dawn illuminates an industrial landscape of power-lines and train-tracks.Unfortunately, the movie also has Tom Cruise, with a shimmer of his own: a bad dye-job on his hair. Short and spiky, it looks as if it was dipped in melted chrome and dusted over with blue kohl. They even colored his adolescent beard and bushy eyebrows the same color. What gives? Was this some attempt to give Cruise ""gravitas""? Meanwhile, we're still looking at the 5' 4"" frame and listening to the pre-adam's apple dipthongs. And he's wearing a silver-gray suit that MATCHES the hair. Oh Lord. (And the advertisement atop Jamie Foxx's cab touts ""Bacardi Silver"". Hey, all this color-symbolism stuff is downright Kubrickian! Right?) The point is, we NEVER buy for ONE SECOND that Tom Cruise is a ruthless contract killer . . . or some of us don't, at least. Otherwise respectable film critics are giving Cruise high marks for believability, but please recall that the newspapers for which they work ADVERTISE these films, and dissing Cruise or his movies would definitely characterize a critic as a ""non-team player"".To make matters worse, the script provides Cruise with all kinds of Oscar-bait. In several windy monologues, the hit-man wheedles on about the existentialism of suburban L.A., the merits of Charlie Mingus, the death ratio per-hour from the Rwanda genocide -- you name it. As a member of the paying movie-going public, I don't need to hear my hit-men lecturing me about Rwanda, thanks. Meanwhile, Foxx's response to all this is a sort of what-the-hell're-you-Talking'-about scrunched-up expression, amplified with several ""whatever, man""'s. My sentiments exactly.Let it be said that Foxx out-acts the Big Shot all over the place. We forget that the cabdriver is Jamie Foxx, even as we're constantly reminded that the hit-man is Indisputably Tom Cruise. But the script lets Foxx down, as well, during the scene in which he's chattering his teeth at an evil drug-cartel overlord. One minute he's terrified . . . the next, he's threatening to go all postal on the gun-toting goon standing behind him. Didn't buy it, sorry. I also didn't buy the old low-battery-cell-phone shtik. Quick, call the Cliché Police before that battery runs out!Best scene in the flick is the convergence of hit-man, cabdriver, police, and Asian drug lords at a thumping night-club. Real suspense here, along with realistic gun-play, even though it further cements the Cruise character as a sort of Terminator with a you-can't-touch-this force-field around him. (Maybe it's the silver glow.) The whole scene sort of reminded me of Chaplin's *Modern Times*, that part in which the Tramp's attempt to serve a customer roast duck across a crowded dance-floor becomes an Epic Quest.But Mann has already lost us before that, when he resorts to pulling out the old coyotes-roaming-Pico-Boulevard card. Ah well -- brainless summer fun. Enjoy. 3- or 4-stars out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
After Midnight: A Killer Ride Through L.A.'s Dark Streets,"Directed by the legendary Michael Mann, ""Collateral"" (2004) is a stylish and suspenseful neo-noir thriller that takes its audience on a gripping journey through the dark underbelly of Los Angeles. This film is a well-crafted blend of action, drama, and character study, bolstered by standout performances from its leading actors.""Collateral"" follows Max (Jamie Foxx), a hardworking taxi driver who finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when he picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise), a ruthless and calculating contract killer. As Vincent forces Max to chauffeur him to various assignments throughout the night, the pair engage in a series of tense and deadly encounters that test the limits of their morality and will to survive.Tom Cruise delivers a chilling and charismatic performance as the cold-blooded assassin Vincent, effectively shedding his usual heroic image for a more sinister role. Jamie Foxx shines as Max, the everyman cab driver who must summon the courage to confront the darkness that has invaded his life. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable, making their cat-and-mouse dynamic all the more engaging.Michael Mann's direction is visually stunning, with his signature use of digital cinematography capturing the moody, neon-lit streets of Los Angeles in all their gritty glory. The film's action sequences are expertly staged and executed, with a particular highlight being a heart-pounding shootout in a crowded nightclub.The script, penned by Stuart Beattie, offers a thoughtful exploration of themes such as fate, guilt, and redemption, elevating ""Collateral"" above your average action thriller. However, some may find the pacing uneven, with a few lulls in the tension during the film's second act. Additionally, certain plot developments may feel contrived or convenient, slightly detracting from the overall experience.Despite these minor flaws, ""Collateral"" remains a taut and thrilling ride, driven by exceptional performances and Mann's masterful direction. This film is a worthy addition to the neo-noir genre and a must-watch for fans of intelligent, character-driven action cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Solid action thriller from director Michael Mann,"I am not much of a fan of either Tom Cruise or Jamie Foxx. I definitely respect both of them as good actors even though the majority of their work dose not appeal to me. This project however is more akin to my taste. Collateral is a dark, noir like character driven action thriller . Both Cruise and Foxx perform very well here with the tight direction of Heat director Michael Mann . Tom Cruise is a ruthless , nihilistic hit-man and Jaimie Foxx is a cab driver forced to transport Cruise to his various targets he sets to eliminate before the night is over. Although very much a different film , Collateral reminds me of Training Day in a lot of ways. However, I found Jaimie Foxx 's character to be much more sympathetic than Ethan Hawke's character in Training Day . Both are excellent films and I'm glad I gave Collateral a chance.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
unremarkable thriller,"Michael Mann's Collateral has a great deal of critical acclaim and hype behind it, so I was looking forward to watching it. But sadly, I was disappointed to find a very unremarkable thriller. The story really is as straightforward as you've heard: taxi driver meets hit-man, hit-man has five stops to make, and needs taxi driver to bring him to all five hit locations. The plot, I think, is the main reason why it was so hard for this film to work- it's just too linear. There are very few or no ways of pulling a plot twist, or changing the course of the plot. It was obvious Vincent would not be arrested with three hits to go etc. Compared to the best thrillers of the last ten years, Collateral appears even more average. It is not as violent as Reservoir Dogs, as complex as The Usual Suspects or as thought provoking as Fight Club. There is still some things to enjoy, however: the brilliant scene where Vincent confronts the muggers, and the nightclub shootout is good too. Foxx is fantastic as the cab driver Max and thoroughly deserved his Oscar nomination, while Cruise is also cold-hearted yet charismatic. If you like thrillers, give this a look, but don't expect anything too heavyweight.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not quite all it's made out to be...,"Collateral is an interesting movie in that it made technological leaps in contemporary cinema, but that it is nonetheless only a slightly above average narrative. I think Stuart Beattie did an exceptionally poor job with the script. Some much of the dialogue is unnatural and out of place. I was actually quite surprised to find out after screening the film that Foxx was nominated for an Oscar. I certainly think his performance was good considering what he was working with in the script. The writing took the characters and kept them too contained. The relationship between Vincent and Max was too comfortable. Collateral could have benefited from more tension between the two characters. The film is a near spectacle to observe. The lighting is executed in an unprecedented form with the ELD panels that were placed inside the taxi. I did admire the use of the Los Angeles backdrop, but at the end of the film I felt a noticeable lack of cohesion and unity. The entertainment level of this film was not close enough to where it should have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very good film! Excellent acting and amazing direction!,"""Collateral"" is directed by Michael Mann, the director of ""The Last Of The Mohicans"", which was a very good film.

Good Acting / Troubled Production,"The main story and players are all over the box art and the other reviews, so I'll focus on the essence of what is good and bad about Collateral.Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and to a lesser extent Mark Ruffalo, are the best parts about the film. Jada Pinkett Smith isn't as impressive, but she does an okay job as a sort of love interest for Foxx.What brings the movie down amounts to a slew of embarrassing production defects. During the mid 2000s, digital filmmaking was starting to gain more traction, and Collateral was one of the first big budget films to make use of the new technology. What might have looked groundbreaking at the time looks simultaneously dated and aimless now. There are way too many shots that are unfocused or jittery for seemingly no purpose, effectively taking attention away from the above average narrative. Another issue is the laughable choice in licensed tunes; the songs aren't necessarily bad on their own but don't match up with the tone of what is on screen. There are some character inconsistencies as well but I don't want to include spoilers here.In summary: If you focus solely on the lead actors performance and narrative, then Collateral will be an enjoyable thriller where Tom Cruise plays against type. If you prefer an engaging story that is propped up with cohesive production design, then there are better crime thrillers to see first, including ones from the same director.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliant directing and acting. Cruise and Foxx proved themselves masters; the Oscar nom is well deserved!,"Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise both proved they are real, actual actors, and not mere 'celebrities' or cutsie poster boys. This movie is a tad dark, but it is very exciting. For me, there was never a moment where the violence seemed gratuitous. That is, there were many moments throughout the film where a 'typical' thriller action movie would have resorted to familiar clichés. Here, Jamie Foxx's character really seemed to react in the same way most of us would have as well. And Tom Cruise, cursed by overly cute looks, has always run the danger of being smarmy, but has avoided it for the most part. In this movie, that danger was never felt, nor ever sensed. For me, that proves that his acting and his portrayal was so solid, and so real, and so right on the money, that its genuineness and veracity were never in doubt.Overall, this movie is violent, although not gruesome. It is directed and acted with subtlety and finesse. It is worthy of Foxx's best supporting actor Oscar nomination--- although Cruise deserved one too. But hey, that's the way it goes, sometimes. Paul Giamati deserved one as well for 'Sideways', along with his nominated co-star, Thomas Hayden Church, but didn't get one this year. I gave this a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Guy gets in the MTA and dies. think anyone will notice?""","Collateral is essentially about the relationship of an assasin for hire ( Cruise) and his taxi driver ( Foxx) who is forced to help him run his "" errands"". Themes of isolation, chance and futility are explored well although not as layered as he's superior "" Heat - 1995"". The "" kills"" are excellent and realistic- as you would expect from Mann and the atmosphere in most scenes are gritty and fitting to the atmosphere he is trying to create. Cruise is casted against -type ( at this stage of his career) but does an exceptional job as the killer and also has most of the meaningful dialogue justifying his actions Foxx is also good here. I thought the cop side of things ( Ruffalo etc) was not fleshed out that well and not overly interesting either- but this is really about Cruise and Foxx. Some of the plot is a bit of a stretch but overall a good movie with a fitting final scene of Cruise in the train. Look fast for Jason Statham at the start.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
a daring and epic thriller,"Tom Cruise shows everyone just how good an actor he is in 2004's hit thriller, 'Collateral', playing a villain for the first time in his career. Also putting in a great performance is 2004 Oscar Winner Jamie Foxx, who received an Oscar nod for this movie as well. Collateral's dark, gritty, and realistic feel and mood will have you clinging on the edge of your seat for the entire time.Max (Foxx) has an honest job as a Los Angeles cab driver, and he's among the best, knowing his city like the palm of his hand. Tonight's been going well for him. He even managed to get the phone number of a very attractive attorney (Jada Pinkett Smith) as she rode in his cab. His next customer is a medium heighted man, with grey hair and a suit to match. His name is Vincent (Cruise). Vincent quickly points out that he has a few stops to make, and that he'll pay a hefty fee to Max if he can drive him to and from these stops.While waiting for Vincent at stop number 1, Max will be shocked as a body flies ontop of the cab. After a few shrieks from Max and cool yet deadly talk from Vincent, Max discovers Vincent's real plan: he is a hit-man, and is using Max to get to and from is assignments, killing them along the way.Tom Cruise's performance is certainly Oscar worthy, but he didn't receive a nod, as the competition was better. He definitely deserved it. Every second of the movie, you will know that Vincent is in control. You'll actually feel as if you're watching Vincent, not Tom Cruise with a hefty hair change. Jamie Foxx turns in a stunning show as well, and he shines towards the end. I'm not spoiling anything here, but all I'll say is that you'll either love or hate the end.Michael Mann's direction is superb, and I'm surprised he didn't receive a best director nomination. He makes every detail of Vincent's personality and past extremely important by emphasizing every single detail. He also makes Vincent the ultimate bada** villain, in many ways that are so cool, I can't tell you because it'd be spoiling. The film is extremely well written, and the only fault I have for it is that it becomes a tad unrealistic towards the end of the film, but with a thriller, that is to be expected, and it doesn't take away from the fact that this is a diamond in the rough. You'll love it, and come away from it feeling like a totally different person, having watched perennial good-guy Cruise play everyone's worst nightmare of a villain.10/10 --spy",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Engaging If Somewhat Convoluted Thriller,"""Collateral"" delivers most of the goods one might be anticipating in a thriller: good guy/bad guy, fatal ultimatum, and fiery consequences which generate exhilarating, roller-coaster action. The acting nods are effective and engaging, with Tom Cruise revying up a typical, taut thriller, playing the ruthless, yet collected, villain, and Jamie Foxx as the confused, subservient pawn in his killer contract scheme. We follow and are consistently amused by the dialogue (""Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape cause of one fat guy""), and become involved with the devious scenario: from kill to kill, from misfire to misfire, etc. The midnight criminal underworld setting is quite appreciative here, setting a dark and gritty tone to the scenario, with dark and shady characters to boot. Primarily, this film is very effective in building on this suspense, dark humor, and exhilaration, yet to some point becomes quite convoluted and difficult to follow thereon. The ending is mostly satisfying, if hardly surprising, and some of the showdown scenes, one might observe, are quite illogical (Cruise and Foxx tumbling upside down in the cab, Cruise fleeing the scene seemingly unaffected). I give high marks to most of the film, which delivers the thrills and pleases in other areas, while the latter third of the film compromises the engagement and somewhat lags in convolution with unfamiliar ""underground jibber-jabber"". Smart, satisfying, and (mostly) entertaining ""buddies turned nemeses"" thriller. *** out of ****",,Anonymous,Crime
Unforgivable,"The plot, although unlikely, keeps the action going and Foxx steals every scene he's in. Cruise seemed a bit mismatched for this part and his acting seemed wooden. The unforgivable part was one line of dialog by Beattie, the script writer, who used two words, ""Barcolounger"" and ""television"", a rip off from the famous men's room scene in ""Runaway Jury"" which was released the previous year. Sure it's a great line, but come on, it wasn't Beattie's to use again! Tsk, tsk. They lost a couple of stars for that.It was also sad that Jada Smith and Mark Ruffalo were used so little in the film. There acting was stellar and I'd have loved a little more out of them.So many scenes in nightclubs became a little tedious and the settings could have been a bit more diverse. But they did cover a nice gamut of racial inclusion by having Hispanic, Asian, and Black nightclubs.The editing was not clipped to jarring shots to keep the pace going which was appreciated. The only scene that bothered me was when Ruffalo's character and his partner meets the FBI agent in the video room. It confused me at first as to who was whom.Overall a nice story to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Absolute stunning piece of work.,"This movie, in short is excellent if not perfect. It's been a while since Hollywood has brought out an exciting thriller/suspense/crime drama. Most movies are either all blood and unrealistic action, or have boring nonsensical plots. This movie had everything. Interesting, debatable dialog that on and off would make you agree and disagree with both the harsh views and the more ideal views.Although the acting is generally good (Foxx surprisingly didn't suck and was actually rather enjoyable) it was Cruise who made this movie. He is truly incredible here. He has so many good facial expressions, angry reactions, depressed reactions, everything, all in this one character. Although this is of course aided by a fantastic script and story, Cruise truly gave life to the script. Not one unnecessary sentence or even word is said throughout the movie. Everything has some meaning at the point it is said. The dialog is interesting, realistic, and more importantly appealing to listen to. Some scenes you won't even think about the firefights or action scenes coming up because you'll be so absorbed in the dialog.The action scenes in this movie are also, very good. They are really suspenseful and constantly leave you guessing as to what next and how it will happen. This movie is similar to ""Inside Man"" (another classic) in terms of dialog and action. Both parts are interesting.Personally I enjoyed every minute of this movie and did not want to stop watching for a moment. It is intense, cool, smart, and has very purposeful dialog. Highly recommended to anyone who has taste in movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wow was I impressed!  Nice action thriller,"I read no reviews and only knew the basic premise of this movie before watching it. But I have to tell you this thing rocked! The more I watched the more I was glued to my seat. I missed it in the theaters and rented it the first night it came out. And I was blown away 10 out of 10 for me, and I rarely give movies a 10.I like Action thrillers anyway, so this was right up my ally. It was directed by the same guy who made Heat, another one I loved, though this movie more reminded me of Training day, in terms of the dark flow of the movie, as well as other elements. It started a bit slower with some character development, kind of easing you into things, then once things start rocking, they just get better and better heading towards a huge climax. Very good flow / pacing, good dialog, acting and character development as well. Very impressive movie overall! Cruise is awesome in his role as the stone cold killer with a list of people to whack. Foxx plays the cab driving underachiever with big dreams but lacks the conviction to make them happen. Both did an excellent job. Jada & Mark play supporting roles and give a good performance as well. The script, dialog, situations and acting are top notch. The action scenes seem very realistic, no special effects needed in this movie as the realism of the situation was effect enough. The story, is simple (a little Hollywood-ish) but good and is brought to life by the acting, the script, and of course the directing I'd definitely watch this movie again and would recommend it to anyone who likes action, suspense, drama, thriller movies.

There are six billion people on the planet and you're getting bent out of shape cause of one fat guy?,"The name Tom Cruise has become synonymous with the word 'wooden' over the last few years, a label not unfairly bestowed considering he's never really starred in a world class film, yet remains one of the highest paid movie affiliates of all time. He innately performs extremely similar roles in all his films, the virtuous and admirable American hero that all women love and that all men want to be. So it comes as a surprise to learn that he takes on a rare villainous role in this film, the role of a sociopathic hit-man tasked with murdering five people in a nights work. Jamie Foxx is cast as the routine taxi driver with aspirations to become something more, but is held back lack of ambition and a reliance on security and routine.Even more surprising than Tom Cruise' role is the fact that this is the finest performance he's ever committed to a film. His depiction as the brutally proficient killer is scarily inspiring. He underplays his role, abandoning his self imposing demeanour for simple efficiency and the end result is that he makes a one man army capable of engaging multiple opponents and defeating them all seem very believable. His execution of the Mozabique drill is highly accurate and it's inclusion gives Vincent a higher degree of realism that if he was merely blindly shooting his way through scores of assailants without injury like any standard Bond film. The rare interludes that provide his philosophical insight into sociology also give Vincent that extra depth that separates him from the standard action villain.Jamie Foxx similarly provides an excellent contribution through his subtle portrayal of an average cabbie thrust into a mortally threatening situation where the slightest mistake would undoubtedly result in his death. His initial bewilderment to the situation is excellently executed, as is his careful transition to assertive man of action, influenced by his constant proximity to Vincent. The relationship between him and Cruise gives the film a certain degree of depth rarely committed to the action thriller genre. The whole film is ridden with carefully laden undertones depicting the delicate balance between planning and improvisation that dominate everyones life. Both characters are extremes of each, and their struggle to irrevocably find a balance between them is superbly scripted.Furthermore, Michael Manns directing is nothing short of stellar. His mix up of camera shots and fast edit cuts give the film a excellently balanced pace, involving the audience with the quick transition through scenes but not storming through the film at such a pace that it compromises necessary detail.Overall this is an excellent film definitely worth watching, one which Tom Cruise undoubtedly deserved an Oscar Nomination for but bafflingly failed to receive.8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

So let's just say my expectations were really low. So I started watching this film and the more i watched it, the more i started to love it. I was pleasantly surprised! Even Tom Cruis had fine acting moments...but the star for me was Jamie Fox. What a performance! I hope he wins an Oscar either for this or for Ray because this was definitely his year!!! I thought this movie was very cleverly made, the script was witty and powerful. Performances were wonderful (I was actually scared of Tom Cruis!)... It was a great film and i look forward to seeing it. Maybe next time i won't be so jet-lagged! :)",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Disappointing, Tom Cruise is still Tom Cruise","Collateral has none of the suspense or thrills of 'The Insider' or 'Heat'. Mark Ruffallo is wasted, Tom Cruise looks like George Michael circa Faith. The taxi driver, Max, appears to have had Danny Glover (in Lethal Weapon) providing 'how to be cool around psycopaths' acting lessons.The love story is token, bowing to commercial pressures which youwould expect from Collateral Damage, but not from Mann. Moreover, Bacardi, purveyors of the funky fresh rum, appear to have sponsored the film outright, and their logo is in the second shot (and subsequent).Tom Cruise is not capable of carrying this off. He managed to play serious in Magnolia because (a) he was parodying himself, so excelled through irony, and (b) he wasn't the lead. Here he is still looking like he did in Top Gun, but with snow spray on his hair, and a Wham 4'oclock shadow.He is not helped by the dialogue either. Mann, like Tarentino, seems to have lost the knack for convincing small-talk among villains. In 'Heat' he humanises unusually brutal characters. In Collatoral, as critics have pointed out, there is an unusual amount of talk between the two leads. I'll steal from Pulp Fiction here; Just because Vincent is a character, doesn't mean he has character.Cruise is still wanting to be the charmer. So unlike Brad Pitt, who knowshow to unsettle us enough to ignore his beauty for a moment, Tom hangs onto his likability like a dog to a slab of meat.The 'sieze the day' and 'look at yourself man etc etc.' would be excusable if Vincent (Cruise) was exposed for the psychopath he is, a la Patrick Swayze in Donnie Darko, but instead Max the Tax sucks it all in and accepts his life is a failure. Odd, given he is the honest, hard- working stooge and Vincent is the ruthless psychopath. There is too much macho posturing, from the muscled cops and from Vincent's various penile extensions (PC tablets, cool Nokia phones and of course huge, huge guns), for his character to be truthfully presented. Instead we get an undercurrent of respect and sympathy for Vincent's effortless machismo and nihilism.This is dishonest, as Vincent's character is never developed enough to provide genuine reasons for our sympathy. So we are left with fetishistic appreciation of Cruise's martial arts skills, which he has picked up over the years in a series of awful action bonanzas, which I hope he returns to after this.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Without a doubt one of the Worst Movies Ever Made,"The film is based on the implausible premise that a contract killer would take a cab for the purpose of completing his assignments.As if wildly contrived and convenient plot details didn't make it bad enough, the movie is poorly conceived and poorly executed. For example, in a large crowd scene set in a crowded trendy club, the blood flows and the bodies fly in a terrifying shoot out. Extras in t he background, however, play it cool as supposedly terrifying patrons who keep a tight hold on their glasses to avoid spilling there martinis. Tom Cruise looks sexy with the slick silver hair, but that's all the movie has to offer.What's more troubling than the implausible premise and absurdly convenient coincidences is the film's less than subtle racism.Whenever the black character played by Jamie Fox points his gun as a white face the victim's fear is played for laughs. You're not supposed to care as the many Asian patrons in a crowded nightclub are caught in the crossfire. It seems calculated to promote laughing at violence as long as the victims are different from you.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Cinematic Masterpiece,"Michael Mann is quite possibly the greatest American filmmaker alive today. I have seen all but two of his movies, and there is only one I would not want to see; ""The Keep."" Everything from ""Thief,"" ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" ""Heat,"" ""The Insider,"" ""Ali,"" and the highly underrated ""Miami Vice,"" Michael Mann has proved himself over and over again to be a very smart and very real filmmaker.In his 2004 film ""Collateral"" he takes his game to a whole new level. Tom Cruise, a very good actor, (But one who needs to sort out some personal problems) takes the role of ""Vincent."" In the beginning of the film we have no idea who he is. Steel gray suit and beard. The shades. What is this movie about? Jamie Foxx plays cab driver ""Max,"" a man with high hopes, but one who does not have the the will to act on them. Considering the plot is out in the open, there's no point in calling it a spoiler; Vincent is a hit man. He's ruthless, cold- hearted, and wickedly funny at times. Tonight he has a job. He needs a ride. That, of course, happens to be Max. This movie is about conversation. It is about two men, completely different from each other, and how they realize that they are the only two that understand each other.When you read about the plot, some will think it to be an action movie; a shoot- 'em up. Do not be mistaken. This film is talk. Talking about life, missed opportunities, and what's to come. If you do not handle films with a lot of dialogue in them, this is not for you. I also believe it is some of the best-written dialogue on film. Great writing by Stuart Beattie, Frank Darabont, and Michael Mann (yes, three people were involved in the dialogue. Frank Darabont wrote a revised draft, and Michael Mann made numerous revisions, including several lines of the movie). I believe that of all screenplays, this one could beat most any.Terrific directing also helps this movie. Just looking at the movie, you know this director was born with a gift. Michael Mann makes this movie in such a way, that it wouldn't have been as good with another one in the pilot's seat. I don't care what you think about Tom Cruise. This is his best performance, and if you don't think he can act 'bad' or 'evil,' I'd remain quiet and wait until you see the movie. A very, very convincing performance. I like many others, believe he was snubbed out of a best actor nomination in '04. Jamie Foxx, who was nominated, delivers a wonderful, solid performance as the cabbie Max. It is secondary only to his performance in ""Ray."" Other great performances come from Barry Shabaka Henley, Mark Ruffalo, Bruce McGill, and Jada Pinkett Smith. Many complain about the ending of this film. I have a question: how was he supposed to end it? It was very well directed and suspenseful, simply mixing elements to the film that had not yet been present. It was a great finish, and especially the last lines of this movie make you feel something you never thought you would; sadness. Wait and see for yourself. I now own the DVD, and must say this film is a tradition. Two other members of my immediate family own it as well. There's nothing not to like; graceful cinematography, superb acting, masterful directing, and a wonderful film. Worth every minute of your time to see. Among the very best of Michael Mann. Among the very best of our time.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Master Class from many angles.,"I've always been a fan of Mann.This movie, in a similar vein to Heat, is very raw.The standout role is usually given to Cruise, and well deserved. But I think just as much acclaim should be given to Foxx, as well.With the majority of the movie taking place inside the cabin of a taxi, both actors, in my opinion, display a master class in acting chops. Depth and nuance abound. The interplay between the characters is impeccable. The juxtaposition and dynamic between a cold hearted hitman, and a normal, every guy cab driver, is expressed with high quality, and believable performances. Scene by scene energy is intense - and maintains that level throughout the movie.In the few external scenes, both display the same stunning performance. Cruise, especially, displays very convincing chops as a hitman for hire. Indeed, in one particular scene, his firearm ability is something to impress.The final act is somewhat formulaic, but settles well with injections from both actors at the same high level.The cinematography throughout is a master class. As is expected of Professor Mann, those who are interested will find a lot to digest in the Director's Commentary.One of my best.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A film I like with Tom Cruise in it!,"I fell in love with Michael Mann's perspective of urban architecture and how it's transferred to film after watching 'Heat'. This film sets you in a great city(L.A.) with great music(Audio Sound plus more)with all the night creatures. Jamie Foxx is amazing and Tom Cruise's Supporting Role is spectacular right to the point. It's as if the role for Tom Cruise was made for him(not at center stage). I have watched this film at least 4 times and sit in awe even though I know the outcome. Mann seems to get the exact angles and creates the urban lighting that puts you right at the scene. I haven't seen 'Miami Vice' yet, but I fully endorse Michael Mann's abilities as a film director and suggest this film as a keeper for any movie collection. It may not be the best Mann film, but surely ranks with 'The Last of the Mohicans' for detail and stylized violence that keeps you in disbelief that these events follow an average guy working a honest living. The only negative point I found was the ending. Foxx's character did more than he was probably capable of, and Cruise's character slipped up when he had did greatness throughout the film. I enjoyed the concept of the storyline that many films lack. Hollywood should try making stories into films rather than finding ways to dazzle us with special effects and amazing computer graphics. Well done Michael Mann!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Intense,"Stuart Beattie gives Michael Mann a script that puts Vincent (Cruise) and Max (Foxx) together in an accidental meeting between an assassin with business on his mind and a cab driver who only wants to relax and enjoy life.Mann gives the movie and characters and intensity that hasn't been seen since Heat and the last five minutes of Last of the Mohicans.We're introduced to Max as a stressed cab driver who has a heart as he drops Annie (Smith) off to work. At the airport, Max tries to refuse Max's offer of an all-night rental, but Max, saving money, can't refuse the cash.At this moment, the tension mounts as Max is put in a situation that wasn't ever in his life plan: the accomplice to an assassin.Foxx plays the role beautifully in a mix of tenderness and naiveté that turns into self-defining bravado.Cruise, on the other hand, is cold and menacing, his only function in life to manipulate and kill.There are a few weaknesses in the plot, emphasized by the lack of development in side characters, including Annie and Fanning (a solid Mark Ruffalo).",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

One of The Best Movies I Have Seen In Years,"The movie Collateral is a very entertaining piece of film work. The plot line of this movie is not one that would entice many, but the way that Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise executed their roles is so unprecedented that it was a film that many people saw as ""edge-of-your-seat"" material. The plot line was where a cabbie had to drive a hit-man around so that he could make his raids. I was on the edge of my seat when Max (Jamie Foxx) discovered that Vincent's (Tom Cruise) final stop of the 5 stops that he had to make was to kill Annie, (Jada Pinkett Smith) the woman that Max met when he took her to her office downtown. I won't go into details because I want to keep the movie suspenseful. Also, I was a bit more impressed with Jamie Foxx's role in the movie because he is mainly a comedian, but he did very well in the role of a thriller. Tom Cruise is an actor who performs in a lot of different genres of films. Many people who watch these kinds of movies will not see them as realistic, but there are plenty of cabbies just like Max that could get suckered in as a chauffeur for a hit-man like Vincent. Overall, I thought that Collateral was a very good movie and I would recommend it to anyone that liked suspenseful thrillers. This is not the kind of movie that will scare people too much, but it is so chronological and entertaining that it would keep someone in the living room watching it from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Darkness Reveals,"With an opening momentarily becalming yet hypo-energetically transmitting chemical interaction between as unlikely a pair as could be imagined; cab driver and lady lawyer, we are hooked.  We have seen Tom Cruise in a fleeting exchange of packages but we want to know more about this pair.  Instead we are brilliantly led through an admittedly stretchy sequence of overtly criminal acts misdirecting our attention entirely from the hookup that eventually puts a human face on events crazier than we might ever conceive.Jada Pinkett Smith (playing lawyer Annie) and Jamie Foxx (as cabdriver Max) are the pair we want to follow.  But Tom Cruise (Vincent) so persuasively moves Max (throwing cash around) to cooperate in his evening's agenda we are compelled to watch what might happen; the why becomes less interesting as the how propels us.  This is an actioner for the more discriminating viewer.Director Michael Mann has shown us brilliance; his ability to draw great work from gifted actors was displayed in the very memorable `Heat'.  DeNiro and Pacino show us more acting in one exchange across a restaurant table than we might find in 10 movies.  Mann does it again, lending that signature spoken about previously: his view about `a movie's genetic coding': a swirling double helix of image and sound, character and story, fantasy and fact.' (http://www.salon.com/bc/1999/02/02bc2.html)Tom Cruise will never fail to impress us with his athletic ability and flat out complete mastery of any and all he is asked to do onscreen.  Witness the absolute talent involved in his gun handling (watch that magazine change mid-movie), his marvelous twist (an exceedingly nimble foot-twist) as he crashes through a pane of glass or just watch him run.   There is no one as compactly and fervently packaged.But on no account can the work of Mark Ruffalo (a seriously focused detective) or Jamie Foxx be minimized; they ground the environment Cruise operates in, giving us plausible moral rightists attempting to set things right.  But Tom trumps all when he tells us `I'm paid to do this' toward the end of the film; a line intoned to accommodate a nihilistic view (auteur).In a season of film completely devoid of the darkness and truth that makes us re-evaluate life as a series of violent and semi-violent acts, we have `Collateral'.  Savor the small things presented: the streets of LA shot from above, that no one can film club scenes like Hollywood can  small wonder the world envies us; we shoot better, more deliberately, than ever another nation would convey; no apology in the mayhem.  Watch it twice, there is no film release of the past few months equal save `I, Robot'.Rating: 3.5 Stars.",,Anonymous,Crime

Hitman in a Hybrid,"""Collateral"" (2004) offers a wild night-time joyride through the neon-lit streets of LA that's as slick as Tom Cruise's suit and as unexpectedly intense as finding a hitman in your backseat instead of a drunk partygoer. This isn't just a movie; it's an adrenaline-pumping, existential crisis on wheels, and let me tell you, it delivers more twists than a drunken GPS navigator.Jamie Foxx plays a cabbie with dreams bigger than his passenger list, only to find those dreams hijacked by Tom Cruise's character, a silver-haired assassin with a to-do list deadlier than a Gordon Ramsay kitchen nightmare. The dynamic between Foxx's everyman desperation and Cruise's icy precision is like watching a chess game where one player thinks the pieces are checkers. It's tense, it's funny, and it makes you never want to complain about your Uber driver again-because, hey, it could be worse.Directed by Michael Mann, who clearly loves his cities bathed in after-hours shadow, ""Collateral"" is as much an ode to Los Angeles at night as it is a thriller. The cityscape, lit by streetlamps and storefronts, turns the mundane into something almost magical, which might just trick you into forgiving the occasional plot hole big enough to drive a cab through. In the end, despite its small detours into the unbelievable, ""Collateral"" remains a thrilling, stylish ride that's well worth the fare. Buckle up, keep your hands inside the vehicle, and please, no flash photography-it scares the hitman.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good but not great.,"I hate Tom Cruise. I can't stand him for the life of me, nearly everything he's done has done more than just annoy the sh*t out of me, however, after receiving several ""this movie is great"" from friends, I decided to give it a spin. This is one of the first Tom Cruise movies that hasn't made me shut it off early. That doesn't mean that the movie itself is a stellar achievement. If I recall correctly there's a little Michael Mann movie called Heat (and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong) that was at least 10 times better than this. Collateral takes us through an evening with Jamie Foxx (Max) and Tom Cruise (Vincent) as Cruise makes five hits. Unfortunately, I was able to guess the plot twists which were good but easy to see coming. The action is very intense which put a smile on my face, especially when Cruise executed the guy who stole his brief case. However, when the action isn't on all we see is arguments, threats, and some character development. The way Foxx develops in the movie was to be expected which wasn't bad because I was getting sick of his character.

Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx both plays roles that are not common to their repertoire. Cruise is fantastic as the hit-man Vincent, he plays it with such ruthlessness and authority, so hats of for Cruise.

The tone of the plot is dark and it does get complicated, especially when the cops become involved but the movie rattles along at great pace. It is nice to see a movie of this type with a big budget and see talented people doing their thing.The plot does have loads of holes in it and Jamie Foxx's glasses do seem silly and pointless but Collateral is none the less for these minor points.

Tom Cruise should be a villain more often!,"This film is directed by the legendary Michael Mann, and Heat being one of my favourite films I decided to see this.I was not disappointed.

Fate brings these two together, and Vincent relies on Max to take him everywhere around the city.The violence in this movie is beautifully timed with nothing over the top.

Another winner from Michael Mann!,"COLLATERAL has been the movie I've been anticipating the most this past summer. Yea, movies like SPIDER-MAN 2, TERMINAL, BOURNE Supremacy, and THE VILLAGE were films that I was excited about, and was very pleased with the finish product. Then films like SHREK 2, and MANCHURIAN CANIDATE were films that I wasn't excited about, and winded up being pleasantly surprised. Yet, I was expecting a majority of the summer films to be like I-ROBOT, DAY AFTER TOMORROW, and VAN HELSING, look good, but no substance. COLLATERAL was a different story, since the least appreciated director working in Hollywood today, Michael Mann, directs it. Watching the sneak preview tonight, everybody in line was psyched up because it was the new ""Tom Cruise film."" I sat in line with my tiny Pocket Essentials copy of the filmography and career of Michael Mann. When I asked people in line if they knew who Michael Mann was, I got from everybody, ""uh, nope!"" No surprise there. I've been building up my excitement for this movie the last couple of weeks by watching the previous films from Mann's career, Thief, THE KEEP, MANHUNTER, LAST OF THE MOHICIANS, THE INSIDER, ALI (director's cut), and my favorite HEAT.I also watched the episode of the directors that airs on Encore about Mann's life and career and reading my two paperback books about Michael Mann's films (no big surprised, both books were published in England). In short COLLATERAL in America will be hyped as the ""New Tom Cruise film"" in Europe, it will be known as the ""New Michael Mann film."" To put it simply, I analyzed and studied what all of Mann's films have in common and what his style was, then I watched COLLATERAL. COLLATERAL has a hit man, Vincent (Tom Cruise), arriving at LAX in the late afternoon, with not really giving details at first what his objective is. A cabdriver, Max (Jamie Foxx), is shown beginning his evening shift. After Max picks up a customer, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), he convinces her that he knows the fastest way to get around Los Angeles, and proves it to her. By having an enjoyable conversation, Annie is intrigued and interested in Max, so much that she gives him her business card, hoping to talk to him again soon. After what seems like what is going to be a great night for Max, the next customer is Vincent, who asks if Max can take Vincent to five different stops in L.A. for the evening, paying Max twice the amount for a cab driver's pay. Max doesn't see this as a problem, until while at the first stop; a body falls down on Max's taxi. It turns out that Vincent is a hit man and the five stops involves with five different people that Vincent is planning on killing. While Vincent and Max travel around L.A., with Max hesitating with what he is doing, a police detective, Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) visits the apartment where Vincent made his first kill, the man isn't there, but there's a broken window and evidence of struggle. While Vincent has Max take him around L.A. to different locations for his contract killings, Fanning is investigating on who did murder the man in the apartment. COLLATERAL similar to Mann's previous crime films, (Thief, MANHUNTER, L.A. TAKEDOWN, and HEAT) is very intelligent and clever, that is what I love about Mann's films. The criminals are smart, while the police officers are also smart (no bumbling crooks or doughnut eating cops in Mann's films). The character of Vincent shows that he is a professional with his job by the way he holds his gun (the similar way all of Mann's characters hold their guns, holding it up while aiming at the same time). While the character of Fanning shows logical motives to what could have happened to the people who were killed.This isn't a slam-bang action packed film, but then again, there isn't a Michael Mann film that is all action and no plot. HEAT and Thief gives complex characters with their motives, feelings, ambitions and personalities, while COLLATERAL does the same thing. If you pay attention to what the characters have to say in COLLATERAL (at least Vincent and Max), you will see them as people, not characters. COLLATERAL is a thinking man's thriller. The acting by Jamie Foxx is good; it's nice to see Foxx being able to give a performance that is different than the comedic roles that he has played in the past (BAIT, HELD UP, BOOTY CALL, etc.) COLLATERAL shows that Foxx can do a great job being a serious actor, and hopefully for his sake, will be seen as a serious actor. While Ruffalo, and Pinkett Smith also do good jobs with their supporting roles. But it is Tom Cruise who proves to do a fantastic job with his role as Vincent. Not since INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE has Cruise left his good guy, heroic image for a dark character, (well the same might also be said about MAGNOLIA). But Cruise shedding his handsome image shows that he really put a lot of effort into playing Vincent. The character of Vincent is for me the most enjoyable and fun villain that I've seen since Daniel Day Lewis' performance as Bill the Butcher in GANGS OF NEW YORK. A villain that shoots out fantastic lines like a Sergio Leone film. But it is Mann's directing is what really impressed me with this film. All of his trademarks are shown in this film. First the digital high definition camera work looked great! Since Mann hasn't worked with Dante Spinotti since THE INSIDER, both Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron do a great job giving COLLATERAL the Mann look, blue lighting with the various TOT (tricks of the trade) shots.I've said it before and I'll say it again, only Michael Mann can make a city like Los Angeles and make it look like a beautiful city with the cinematography. Besides the cinematography, Mann uses his other trademarks, the great soundtrack, this time it is techno music mixed with, blues, and Latin, and the characters (particularly Vincent) dressed sharp and stylish. But since Vincent is a criminal, he doesn't wear a tie, similar to Neil McCauley, DeNiro's character in HEAT. Plus Mann shoots on location in L.A., making the city more realistic, mixing office high rises with Koreatown stores and nightclubs, and old well kept apartment buildings. In my review of HEAT I praised Mann for giving the viewer an accurate look of Los Angeles. Since L.A. is my second home, Mann uses the same moves in COLLATERAL. I could go into more detail why I loved COLLATERAL, but why spoil the party? This is the best film I have seen all summer and perhaps this year (although I still love KILL BILL VOL. 2). My expectations were met and like all of Mann's other films, COLLATERAL requires multiple viewings. For people who love Michael Mann films, I would rank this film his 3rd best, behind HEAT and THE INSIDER. For people who enjoy a smart intelligent thriller, like BOURNE Supremacy, but not as much action and less jerking of the camera, then COLLATERAL should please you. But if you're looking for an action packed Jerry Bruckheimer /Michael Bay film, then watch something else. But COLLATERAL is the first film this year that can be considered worthy of an Oscar nomination or two. Great show! ***** (Out of five)",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Surprisingly The Worst Movie I've Seen In A While,"Where do I start with this mess. I wasn't impressed by Foxx's performance at all, and Jada Smith's minor character was one dimensional. Cruise did relatively well, but failed to bring any sort of humanity to his character, some better writing would have helped. The music was terrible, the 'dramatic' scenes in the taxi driving through the city at night looked straight out of a music video. The plot was okay in theory, but was a mess of coincidences the more you watch. How two of the main characters in the movie, (who also didn't know each other before), rode Max's taxi DIRECTLY AFTER EACH OTHER amazes me. Women also don't give their cards to random taxi drivers, and i could talk for hours about Cruises aim (good for the targets, sh*t at the final scene because the screen writers wanted it). The directing was mediocre, expected shots at expected times, it was all the coincidences that really angered me. The entire movie is one huge coincidence and it doesn't play out well, the ending was expected and cliché and save your time to watch something decent (American History X, There Will Be Blood, for gods sake even Mission Impossible because at least that franchise knows its ridiculous)",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Most Over-rated movie of 2004.,"Overall, the movie was OK. It was not a stinker or anything, but to say it's in the top 10 of the year and to give all those award nominations is just plain crazy. Tom cruise's character was just a little too werid and the whole movie was just way to over the top. Jamie Fox did an OK job, but not as good as in the Ray Charles movie. I would say pass on this average film with goofy disgusting violence. It appeals to werid people I think.I hated the car chases and how Tom just walks around shooting people in the head. Too crazy and ugly of a movie. It was kind of like watching a high-budget version of Resivor Dogs but without the creativity and humor.If someone asks if you have collateral, just say no.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Adequate Collateral,"With each passing year the quality of action movies is depleting. Special effects are overtaking storylines and stunts overshadow the plot. Collateral, being a 21st century movie is surpisingly classic in its elements.With a simple yet solid storyline, the movie is directed really well, with good performances by the leading actors. The pace of the movie is really impressive and resonates well in the soundtrack.The action is neither too oppressive nor too over the top . A relief to be sure, in an age where spies and superheroes outdo each other.This movie is a part ""the list"" and I revert to it often.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best ever Tom Cruise movies,"I suppose this is one of the best ever Tom Cruise movies.Excellent acting-nothing to add.JAMIE FOXX is really not Supporting Actor in this movie. The plot is so interesting, it is almost impossible to guess the ending. And the idea of course-to kill 5 people one night is great.As for Michael Mann - despite his age he is the modern director Later i think the Thrillers of 2000-s and 90-s will be associated with his name.Tom Cruise is no longer a young boy, which he was in the 80-s.He doesn't need great actors near him any more(such like Newman or Hoffman).I can't imagine anybody else playing the role of Vincent.And why he was not nominated for Oscar?

Cruise is not the problem,"I had high hopes for COLLATERAL.  Being directed by one of my favorite filmmakers and featuring Tombo ""The Gun Guy"" Cruise, I expected this picture to be the gem of the summer.  But, let me say: I was wrong.  Big time.  The script is weak, flustered by strangely bland moments and hampered by a cat and mouse affliction that never lived up to its afore mentioned promise. Cruise provides the depth for Vincent, a machine-like villain.  Nonetheless, Max (played by Jamie Foxx) dances both sides of the character line; at times, hating his captor, at other times, in confiding him.  I found the relationship to be terribly unrealistic.  As for the rest of the cast, their story lines are wasted and given little resolution.  As a result, I cannot recommend COLLATERAL.  Due to its lack of structure, heart, and narrative, it implodes into the LA nightlife it so highly wants to emulate.",,Anonymous,Crime
An extremely effective action thriller.,"Fast paced, well acted, beautifully shot, incredible cinematography, and has a good overall theme. Collateral is entertaining and has plenty of rewatchability.

Bad night to be a cab driver!,This movie was good don't get me wrong but a few things were added that should not have been in there. The story line was good. The cast chosen was pretty fit and solid. Cruise has done a good bad-guy role and shows that he still has acting left in him. Foxx plays a very good role of someone that has no choice(do or die) role which had a solid outcome of a hero. I wanted to see Foxx in a serious situation and he pulled it off considering the most movies have been funny. This movie all in all is one that moves kinda slow and picks up good as it goes. I give it 6 out of 10 due to the situations had background music when it did not need it. The music was pumped up after the action was over. The direction of the movie did not get bad it had a few twist other than that the ending was kind of predictable. OVERALL the movie is WELL WORTH SEEING.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best thriller of the last 10 years,"I honestly think this film is probably: a) the best Tom Cruise film, because, lets be honest, there aren't that many good Tom Cruise films, and b) the best action thriller since 'Heat' in '95. Although it's not as good as 'Heat', it is pretty close. The two main actors are brilliant in it - Jamie Foxx showing the kind of acting that got his the Oscar for 'Ray', and Tom Cruise showing that he is better as a bad guy (like 'Interview With A Vampire'). To back this up, the supporting cast are good as well - led by Jada Pinkett Smith - and the soundtrack constantly pumps out modern rock and dance tunes. Even though there aren't as many twists as there should be in a good thriller, it makes up for it with great action and great acting. If anyone knows a better thriller in the since 'Heat', please let me know!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Why watch ""Collateral"" when ""Heat"" is the ultimate classic?","Tom Cruise fans surely will love this movie. But all others that arent particularly fan of Tom Cruise, be wary, because the story of this movie is not very credible: cabdriver gets hijacked by a serial killer and is forced to drive him towards the locations of 5 designated killings. Sounds thrilling. But it unfortunately lacks story credibility.I must admit though that I have watched ""Collateral"" several times, but suddenly I got irritated about the uncredible story. So probably a lot of people who enjoy gangster thrillers will love this flick during first viewing, when one more easily gets swept away with the suspense of the story. I only wanna warn those who expect more: lower your expactations about story credibility...Michael Mann as a director has made many great other gangster movies. ""Manhunter"" is a classic. ""Public Enemies"" with Johnny Depp is great. ""Thief"" however is the debut of Michael Mann and this movie is truly COOL. It is on Tarantino's favorite list. And for a good reason. Because ""Thief"" has got everything what ""Colletaral"" has NOT got. ""Thief"" has got balls. Men are real men in ""Thief"".Michael Mann truly made his life's achievement though with the classic thriller ""Heat"" starring Al Pacino and Robert de Niro. My advice to everybody would be to wach ""Heat"" instead of ""Collateral"" and you will have a guaranteed credible story, with mindblowing acting performances and a killing suspense with a gloriously dark final.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

I felt the most 'transported' by the club scene - it just sucked me right into it. I felt it - the crowd's panic, the confusion, the randomness.

"Cruise, Foxx, and Mann- Brilliance was bound to exist.","A skilled cab driver named Max Durocher (Jamie Foxx) in Los Angeles who finds himself transporting Vincent (Tom Cruise) to five different locations for a large sum of money, but quickly realizes that Vincent is a ruthless assassin who is being paid to kill five people throughout the course of one night.What makes this movie so great is its incredible cast of Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise. This is the first movie in which Jamie Foxx can actually be considered a great actor and the point at which he turned his career around entirely. And as we all know, Tom Cruise can act pretty well also. But it's not the single performances that make their acting so incredible. It is the on-screen chemistry that they share in their conversations. Vincent is such a complicated character that Max repeatedly tries to get to the core of. Their relationship is so complicated throughout the movie, you start to wonder ""What is Max thinking?"" Each conversation was written so beautifully that it made want to cry in joy.The action in the movie was incredible. It starts off extremely slow, but turns fast paced all at once somewhere near the middle of the movie. A scene in which Vincent takes Max to a bar and they talk about jazz with the owner and Vincent suddenly kills him at the end of the conversation was incredibly well done. The realistic but vicious assassinations as well as a great gunfight scene at a club make Collateral a modern action classic.

One of the best movies this year---9/10,"Collateral is one of the best films of 2004. Now i admit, i haven't seen too many this year. But there just wasn't much to see. Collateral is a movie i have been looking forward to for some time because it goes back to the days where a movie can take place in the current times and not feature CGI armies clashing while orchestra music plays. It is about characters, plot twists, and atmosphere. These are the elements that suck you into a movie. And Michael Mann know it. Not to mention he has a great cast to work with. In probably his best work to date, Tom Cruise plays Vincent, a hit-man with an itinerary that must be cleared before dawn. I always knew Cruise was a good actor, apparent in movies like Top Gun, Minority Report, and A Few Good Men (in which he was especially good). But i never knew he could pull of an outstanding performance, and yet he does just that in Collateral. Who knew he just had to try being a bad guy for once? He did receive a little help from Jaime Foxx, who plays cab driver Max, Vincent's unwilling hostage. Foxx's equally impressive performance plays off of Cruise's and vice versa. I knew Jaime Foxx could be a great actor when i saw him in Ali, also by Michael Mann.The script is full of great dialogue, (""Don't do anything stupid. You don't have the trunk space"") and plenty of tense situations that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The shootout in the disco, the mugging of Max while tied to the steering wheel, and max trying to pass as a hit-man himself are all classic scenes that i can watch over and over. This is a slickly directed, superbly acted, and nail-bitingly suspenseful film. It's one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. And it's got a Tom Cruise violently killing people.

Not like any other night!,"Fantastic.  Absolutely fantastic.  Tom Cruise did a superbly great job and Jamie Foxx surprisingly wasn't bad either.  This one has bumped A Few Good Men from my list for #1 favorite Cruise films.  I think he will at least be nominated for Best Actor for Collateral if not win and I would like to see that happen very much.  I was sure that Cruise would put on a show but I wasn't sure that Foxx would but he did.  I didn't have a very high opinion of his ability before I watched this so he scored a few points with me with his performance.  All I can say is THANK GOD they didn't cast Adam Sandler as Max the audience would have gone out and collectively hired a guy like Vincent to take care of him once and for all.  Enough humor but they did not go overboard.  It did take the edge off a little in what Vincent was doing which kept the movie from becoming too dark.  I was a little surprised by the ending but I didn't feel that was bad, maybe not what I would have done, but certainly not bad.  Michael Mann is showing some considerable skill in his directing he's moving up in the world.  And using the digital photography really added to the experience.  Brilliant.  Go see this one.

One Question,"This is a very good film, with lots of strong performances. Both Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise do a fine job, and they have a terrific on-screen chemistry. I do have one question: why is it that Jamie Foxx was regarded as a SUPPORTING ACTOR in all the award nominations the film received? He is clearly the protagonist in the film, as it is HIS story that we are being told. The range of emotions demanded by his role is greater than any of the other roles in the film. Besides that, he has more screen time than Tom Cruise. There is barely a frame of film without Mr. Foxx. So how does that add up to a supporting performance? Whom is he supporting?",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

One night Max picks up a man named Vincent. Vincent ask Max to stop at 5 locations where Vincent plans to kill 5 men. The film then turns into a hostage situation between a cab driver and a contract killer.*Review: I think this is one movie that needs more attention because it seems that a lot of people have just ignored the movie. This movie is so close to being one of the best thrillers that I have ever seen so far. Everything about this movie is great like the acting, directing, story, writing, and the dialogue between these men. One thing that I did not like about this movie is the ending. The ending just didn't feel right because there were some holes that needed to filled and your just begging for more. This movie made a turning point in Tom Cruises career which made him a great actor. Also this proved that Jamie Foxx can play any role you give him.

Entertaining But as an L.A. Noir Flick One Essential Ingredient Is Missing,"Director Michael Mann successfully pulls off an entertaining noir flick set in Los Angeles that gives co-star Tom Cruise his most appealing and sympathetic role since ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Cruise is Vincent (a Man With No Last name), a contract killer who has worked for years in what he euphemistically calls ""the private sector.""Jamie Foxx is cab driver Max, a fellow with big dreams of starting his upscale limo outfit. He takes a pretty woman to her office and they exchange banter - the promise of a relationship is boosted by her giving the cabbie her card. She's an assistant U.S. attorney pulling an all-nighter on a big criminal case. That's all we learn but it's enough to have most viewers pretty sure of what the last scene will offer.Next Max picks up Vincent. No, Vincent picks up Max and offers him a wad of cash to be his exclusive all-noir chauffeur while he runs errands. Max reluctantly accepts and they head to Vincent's first stop. Enter a dead guy who crashes thunderingly onto Max's cab (but does remarkably little damage).Max now learns that he's the local guide and ground facilitator for a hit man. As he takes Max from one murderous assignment to the next, a relationship of sorts develops but there's no Stockholm Syndrome here. Max remains true to the values inculcated in him by his beloved mom.Speaking of Max's mom, there's a diversion to a hospital, demanded by Vincent, so Max won't miss his daily visit to his recovering mother, Ida. Ida, in a short but delightful scene, is played by the wonderful Irma P. Hall. My pleasure was somewhat darkened by wondering if she could only play a bed bound character as I know she hasn't really recovered from her near-fatal Chicago car accident of over a year ago.Only one cop, Fanning, well played by Mark Ruffalo, begins to piece together the multiple night-time deaths and he realizes the F.B.I., interested in these victims, hasn't made certain proper connections (just why the F.B.I. is concerned with organized crime figures in L.A. when they ought to be investigating USA Patriot Act offenses is never revealed).The action speeds up as Max increasingly finds a new courage that kindles a drive (pun intended) to thwart Vincent's assignments, especially his last one (now YOU know who the intended last victim is, right?). We're treated to short bursts of Vincent's sociopathic take on life, love, philosophy, economics - he covers all the bases.Cruise and Foxx make a good acting team but their plasticized portrayals are more the result of the director's derivative vision rather than their own shortcomings. The L.A. of ""Collateral"" is too pristinely clean at night. Even the club where Vincent launches inspired, multi-weaponed mayhem seems like an okay place to take a first date. What's absolutely missing in this movie is that most essential L.A. noir ingredient - grittiness. It's there in full measure in both ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Mulholland Drive."" Instead ""Collateral"" is essentially a star vehicle for two fine actors but the story suffers from the constant view of them and not the painfully sharp, dark, sinister corners of a roiling, brooding L.A. that can make a noir film grip an audience.Not surprisingly, instead of the melodrama produced by fine acting and good dialog, stunt driving and crashes are indispensable to the director's vision.Near the end Vincent lets loose some real emotion with a plaintive cry to Max, ""I do this for a living."" That's been apparent since the film's first moments so, perhaps, director Mann has Vincent uttering a too common American complaint: dissatisfaction with a career path that can't be abandoned. Yes, even contract killers may wish they owned a KFC franchise instead of a Glock.While fun to watch, ultimately there are too many improbabilities in Vincent's night in Lalaland. ""Minority Report"" seems, in retrospect, more real (but that film as well as this one insures that Cruise can continue to pay his bills).Fun but a good opportunity for a really gripping film missed.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
definitely an achievement,"This is a good movie by all means. Though it may not have been worthy of 2 Oscar nominations, it was entertaining and painted a dark picture of L.A. Tom cruise has improved so much as an actor that he can play seemingly any character nowadyays. Bravo, Mr. Cruise! Also, Jamie foxx has established himself as a very good actor as well and he plays the ambitious cab driver thrust into a difficult situation quite well. Cruise portrays the hit-man perfect, and there are some generally touching scenes throughout this movie. The thing about Collateral that stops it from being a great movie is the character build over the plot. In great movies, these 2 are equally divided and told in a brilliant way. Also, this movie would have been much better with a film-noir or independent feel to it, instead of just trying the ordinary built on acting.

Think anybody'll notice?,"I really appreciate the actors who step out of their box and take roles that are unlike anything they have done before. Tom Cruise here plays a ruthless contract killer who's run in with an everyday cab driver turns out to be much more than what he thought. Cruise, to my knowledge, has never really played the villain. So to see him absolutely kill this role makes me think of the endless possibilities for his future career. Collateral is a near masterpiece in the crime thriller genre. I can even see influences of it in this years Nightcrawler. It is quite simply one of the best crime films of the past decade.Michael Mann gives us another classic but also presents us with a terrifically well rounded cast. Cruise and Foxx are great as the leads. But Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett Smith are also great. Not to mention the brief but memorable cameos by Statham and Bardem. I loved the dynamic between Cruise and Foxx. Max (Foxx) is just a man who never really went after his dreams while Vincent (Cruise) is just killing people for money but also at the same time wants to be known for something. I really loved the way the film presented these crimes and how Max reacted to them. Most films display murder to a normal person and they shake it off like it was nothing. But Max is truly terrified of Vincent and what he's capable of. They were never truly meant to spend significant time together, but one thing leads to another and we have the most dysfunctional relationship possible. And even Max resents Vincent for what he is doing, there is some sort of mutual respect present here. Max at one point seems to look up to him.The rides are great and it's interesting watching Cruise seamlessly play this character, but it's the ending this film is worth watching for. It was a great way to be both highly intense but at the same time mostly realistic. There may have been a few times where it seemed unrealistic, but it never took me out of this roller coaster crime thriller.

Treats us like morons,"There was a lot of clever talk in the beginning, which was good, and they should have kept it that way. But before long the movie inevitably sold its soul to the usual Hollywood idols: guns and cars. What is it with movie producers and guns and cars? This could have been a great movie if it had kept up the tension in the talking rather than the usual childish blasting and crashing about. And funny how Tom Cruise's gun was made to sound so much louder than everyone else's...If you start to think about this movie for just a few seconds the whole thing falls apart. Cruise just doesn't look like a guy who can scythe his way through a crowd of bouncers in a nightclub, nor did his character seem like a guy who would think that such a ridiculous thing is necessary in order to take someone out, but he does look like some edgy guy who can do a lot of talking, trying to rationalise what he's doing. More of that sort of thing would have helped paper over the incredible holes in the plot. Hey, don't even start thinking about the plot for a moment, absolutely none of it makes sense. Like how could Vincent with a single blow of an axe cut off the power in an entire office block, including the telephones? - and why did he have to do that anyway...? Nor did Vincent's inane philosophising about Darwin and I Ching - two diametrically opposed concepts - make sense. I can only suppose we weren't supposed to be intelligent enough to worry about that.Well, Cruise and Foxx did good enough jobs. Unfortunately, everyone else in the movie were mind-numbing stereotypes. If I was Cruise, who seems to be taking care of his own career and the films he chooses, I would have darn well pointed out all these shortcomings to the writer and director. Are actors so wrapped up in their own roles that they don't know how good or bad the rest of the film is going to be...? Just wondering...Anyway, in the end this movie proved to be just so much glossy movie packaging rather than something that would really engage us or thrill us intellectually. It just wasn't up to it. And finally, the ending was nothing. Like something we'd seen before in twenty other movies. You could sense how the producers picked up the first ending that came out of the box, wanting to finish up and go home having done their routine 9-5 - without the slightest inclination to give us something to think about, like an alternative, surprise, unorthodox ending, that really didn't waste Cruise's rather interesting character.Watchable stuff, but a big disappointment for a movie that's being so highly rated on this website.",,Anonymous,Crime
So much more than just a two hour action film.,"The state in which the crime genre is in when it comes to modern day Hollywood is that of one teetering on a brink; but what that brink is, I don't exactly know. Long gone are the days of those voiced over film noirs with their sultry femme fatales trying to distract the detectives from their missions but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. You do get the odd throwback (I'm thinking Sin City) but nowadays; fast, pulsating films with recognisable Hollywood names that lighten up the screen seem to be the norm when thinking of the crime genre. In Collateral, we have a perfect example of a fast, flashy but with a relatively simplistic concept for a film all mixed up to produce an entertaining piece of film-making.I was appalled with Miami Vice; another modern day crime film made through the conventions described above and coincidentally, another Michael Mann film but here, Mann succeeds and this is through a number of things. First, there is an atmosphere. There is an awkward, unpredictable atmosphere that sucks us in. Second, Mann actually makes good use of the film's setting. Like Miami Vice, Mann uses a colourful yet seemingly deadly mass urban utopia as the setting only this time, it's captured perfectly on screen; something he also did in Heat. Here, the setting is used well; the film isn't confined to a taxi cab for two hours and whenever the character's are outside we are allowed to breath and take in our surroundings as the action continues; whether it's on top of a sky scraper in a race against time or a foot chase over a pedestrian bridge.What's also effective is the way the film manipulates its viewer; often, I'm sure, without them even realising. Tom Cruise plays a character called Vincent and to say he really, really sheds his skin is an understatement. Off the top pf my head, I can name the first two Mission Impossible films, Top Gun and The Colour of Money as Cruise films I can recall seeing. In Collateral, Cruise really opens up and shows us he's much more than we take him for. His character is something that not only plays games with Max (Foxx) but also with the audience. We're made to like Vincent: he's smart, he's sharp, he's just cool  too cool. What's more, he completes his first two hits without us even seeing him do it, meaning that we are not yet put off this cool cat as we haven't yet seen him kill any one. Max, on the other hand, is just playing a boring taxi driver. How are we meant to associate with him? This is clever as it turns on its head half way through and by the end, everything is completely upside down as the film has manipulated you into rooting for someone you thought was reasonably lame in comparison to this super-duper hit-man who can now be viewed as a bit of a psychopath. This is the first little clever thing Collateral does.The second is the feeling and overall theme. For a film to have a theme is great enough on its own. Some fantastic films over the years have had themes. Pulp Fiction's was redemption, 2001: A Space Odyssey's was evolution and Collateral's, from my reading, is circulation. Everything comes around and goes around every once in a while. Now and again taxi drivers pick up the wrong fare and Vincent's story half way through (that echoes at the end) about circulation as he rides off (so to speak) leaves a taste in the mouth that isn't quite bitter but isn't exactly sweet, either.Although with some rather ludicrous product placement very early on; Collateral is not only a popcorn-esqe thrill ride with chases and shootings; but also a more deeper, more sensual look at life as a whole. Combine this with clever film tricks and traits only good experienced directors can produce and you've got yourself a truly memorable film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mann's ode to the night,"This film really surprised me in a few ways. Reading the backside of the DVD and remembering those things I heard about the film I wasn't immediately interested. Though a friend of mine wanted to see it, so we hired it. It seemed a good choice in the end.The way this movie was filmed is interesting and resembles much to what we expect to see when watching a video-clip. The quick alternation of scenes and camera-angles will carry the viewer immediately into the world of the main-characters: L.A. by midnight. This is the successful aspect of the movie. And, which is already made clear by a lot of board-people and commentators on the IMDb website, the actors are pretty good as well.But then there's the plot and the story as such, which are, compared to the level of the filming and the acting, amazingly non-committal. Some scenes are therefore pretty bad (in my view is the night-club scene where one of Tom Cruise's victims hides out one of the worst scenes and definitely the lowest ebb of the entire movie). Now what I'm trying to figure out is: did Mann want to make a picture of the night and it's violence... or did he want to make an action movie and did it accidentally became the ode to the night it has become. Well, perhaps that just depends on what you (or I) want to see in this entertaining movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Collateral,"A supposed action movie starring Jamie Foxx, of all people, and Tom Cruise as the bad guy; that's about as bad as movie formulas get, right? Boy was this film a surprise. Director Michael Mann, famous for such films as Heat and Last of the Mohicans, has created a cool, stylistic and thrilling crime drama with unexpectedly fine acting, excellent cinematography, great sound and a gripping story.Story The film opens with a bearded, grey-haired Tom Cruise exchanging his suitcase at the airport. This older, slyer Cruise is much different than what movie-goers have come to expect, and Cruise definitely pulls it off. As soon as we are introduced to Cruise's character, the movie shifts to a taxi station, where we see Max (Jamie Foxx) getting into his cab and leaving for his normal shift. Jamie Foxx is definitely an interesting pick, considering he was mostly known for comedy and Booty Call up until this point, but Foxx gives a surprisingly breakout performance and establishes himself as a future big-time star. The shift starts off like any other and Max picks up Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), a no nonsense lawyer who quickly gives very specific directions. Eventually, the characters start to open up and the fare becomes one long conversation. The interesting opening gives insight into the character of Max, and also introduces us to Annie, who will reappear in the climax of the film. Max drops off Annie downtown and then, under unusual circumstances, picks up Vincent (Cruise). Vincent attempts to connect with Max, but to no avail. But when Vincent is brought to his desired destination, he proposes a deal: he has to make five stops, and he is willing to pay seven-hundred dollars for the night. Max accepts because it is only a ""part-time job"" to pay the bills. This marks the beginning of the relationship between the cold, always in control hit-man Vincent and the bumbling cabbie Max. The suspense starts setting in when Max realizes he isn't just driving around a customer, he's taking part in a series of assassinations! Collateral isn't a dumbed down, generic action flick but rather a smart, enthralling drama set around these two men and this one night. Mann uses controlled settings exceptionally well, with much of the movie taking place inside of the cab and all of the events taking place in one single night. The use of character development in a suspense-thriller as opposed to unnecessary action is refreshing change. The film is such a wild, top-notch experience that the ending is a little disappointing, but not entirely bad. Smart dialogue and meaningful character relationships are rare now days, so believe me when I say Collateral is a very fresh and well executed movie. It is by no means perfect though. After the hard-hitting first two acts, the ending was disappointing and dare I say over the top. While Collateral is still a quality film, a weak end prevents an all-around instant classic.Cinematography With great camera work and amazing lighting effects, Collateral features some of the best cinematography I've seen in a while. Mann's beautiful L.A. night really is an incredible treat, with the empty streets and stunning shade of lights, dominated by a blue tint. Collateral just has so much style, due in part to the visual masterpiece we see on screen. Later on is what I consider to be one of the best shots of the film, when Max and Vincent are driving along an empty highway when a few coyotes walk across the street. The way in which the coyotes cross, Vincent's facial expression, the entire scene is skillfully crafted and is one of the main visual highlights. The top-notch style and cinematography sets it apart both from other movies in recent years as well as movies within the genre.Sound The sound and music is another strong point of the film, with nice, loud sound effects and a mood setting soundtrack. The music seems to coordinate perfectly with the action and camera work, and it creates numerous memorable scenes. When Vincent and Max go into the ""jazz club"" at the third stop, it is unforgettable. The ""Fever Nightclub"" scene is edge-of-your-seat action, with the music once working perfectly. The sound compliments the style, and really adds to the film.DVD The quality is first-rate, and there are some interesting special features spanning the two discs. ""City of Night"", a behind the scenes documentary, is intriguing and enjoyable. Also included are features on Cruise and Foxx, a deleted scene with commentary from Mann, ""Shooting on Location: Annie's Office"", and ""Visual FX: MTA Train"". Technical information: English DTS 5.1 Digital Surround Sound, English and French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, English Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround; 2:40:1 Theatrical Aspect Ratio, enhanced for widescreen TV's.Overall Collateral is an excellent, stylized drama, with heavy emphasis on smart dialogue and character development. An all around solid performance, it performs exceptionally well in the sound and cinematography departments. Too bad it could not remain consistent, because the film really had something going. Entertaining, thrilling, witty, and gripping, Collateral is one of the best films of 2004.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Music...??,Hi.. i enjoyed the movie.. gave me another view on Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox..I found it had many different aspects to follow.. Jamie's relationship with his mother..i actually liked his idea for the limo company loll..i also agreed with Tom's character about big city's and people being so disconnected.. OK i have a question tho.. i was wondering if anyone could tell me the name and artist of the song.. that was playing in the taxi when Jada asked him to turn it up.. he commented about it being a classic.. I've looked at the sound track.. but of course that doesn't help if i don't have the title..I hope people are still reading these comments because seeing i'm in Australia the movie has only this week been released on DVD in my town.. Yes i'm in a very small country town.. Thanx..,6.0,Anonymous,Crime
unrealistic and predictable.,"I don't know whether it was the soundtrack or the cinema, but the dialogue was difficult to hear most of the time, and seeing how the film was based mostly around two men in a cab, you needed to be able to understand what was being said. The nightclub shootout scene was so unrealistic and unlikely and the ending was textbook predictable. Why didn't all the other passengers run screaming off the train when it stopped at the station? Why do film producers think that graying the hair of a youngish man will make them look older? They just look like young men with fake gray hair. I don't know how the producer wrapped it up and said to himself, ""yes, thats a great film"" I had to force myself to stay and watch it. Hugely disappointed!",,Anonymous,Crime
A Perfect Movie: Why Would Anyone Fault It?,"Where to begin. This movie reminded me of ""Drive"" with Ryan Gosling. I have interviewed the author of that movie, Jim Salis. Another perfect movie. Daniel H. Pink narrated Drive, and wrote a non-fiction book called Drive. (Motivational.) Along with other titles no one seems to have made the link to. Back to Collateral. The writers such as Rick Garcia and Rene Reyes have concocted the perfect image of Los Angeles from a taxi, based on the script by Stuart Beattie. In Drive Gosling was a stuntman driving stolen cars in Los Angeles, and went on to ""La La Land."" I have written a prequel to Collateral set in the Florida Keys in the 1980s titled ""The Key to Vincent."" It is included in my new book ""Cat on a Cold Tin Roof,"" along with a novella set in Dubai, where Tom scaled the Burj Khalifa. Will Smith's wife was in The Matrix with Keanu Reeves, one of the humblest actors of John Wick and Inception, among others. Collateral is underrated and didn't make much money, but it has a killer sound track, and Jamie Foxx is one of the few friends of Tom on Facebook, highly talented and with a new memoir out. A must see movie, this, directed by Michael Mann, who is represented by The Story Factory. Javier Bardem has dialogue with Foxx in a nightclub that is classic, and in a jazz club there is much appreciation with a surprising twist. The dialogue is available via search.

Wasted effort,"OK, so I'm buying Jamie Foxx as a repressed, compulsive cabbie. I can even sorta buy Jada Pinckett-Smith as a federal prosecutor with a thing for repressed, compulsive cabbies. But then you throw in Tom Cruise as Vincent, the World's Shortest Contract Killer, and it's just way too much to believe. Director Michael Mann gives Cruise some leftover Don Johnson stubble from his Miami Vice days, and Bill Clinton's hair, but beyond that it's still just ""Risky Top Days of the Last Cocktail"" with a gun. Besides choosing Mini-Me as the villain, this movie also has some problems with believability- after all, what kind of hitman is so concerned about leaving witnesses, yet kills just about everybody around in as public a place as possible? What kind of crime boss would bother killing the prosecuting attorney, when there are dozens more in the same office ready to take over? And what kind of cabbie drives a fare all over town, but never turns on the meter? On the plus side, Jamie Foxx simutaneously conveys both abject fear and annoyance with the miniature sociopath who threatens his life while nagging him about his professional and romantic failures. The cinematography is wonderful, showing nighttime L.A. to its best advantage. Unfortunately, Tom Cruise is simply too short to be scary, and his Tony Robbins-meets-Sammy the Bull routine wears thin too fast.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Still really good 18 years later,"Wow, 2004 was 18 years ago. So, this is my first time watching this movie and I have to say it's really good! You can tell it's a good film by how well it's stuck in 18 years, the plot is really well written, great acting and the cinematography was superb.First off, I need to give credit for the acting performances. Jamie Foxx was stand out, but both him and Tom Cruise were fantastic. The characters portrayed were incredibly well written and the arcs that they had worked great. Even though you had a ""bad guy"", you had glimpses of good in there, both subtle and not to subtle and it really made for a good viewing.The plot was incredibly well written. There was a couple of ""wow"" moments that really keep you motivated to know what's gonna happen next, there was many moments that kept me on the edge of my seat also and the intensity built was sustained throughout at a good level, but what impressed me the most was how you have no idea how this is going to end. You're left guessing up until the very end and it's not clear at all what direction it's going to head in. Ironically, the ending was probably the one thing I disliked about this movie. Disliked is a strong word actually, but I felt a little underwhelmed and I thought it could have been wrote better. That's not to say it's bad, but absolutely could be better.Beyond that though, this is a fantastic movie that massively entertaining, fun and intense and you have the pleasure of watching some fantastic acting.

Collateral,"Tom Cruise is Vincent the bad guy in Michael Mann's neo noirish Collateral.With his steel grey hair and steely determination. Vincent is a contract killer who accepts a briefcase in a fleeting cameo by Jason Statham.It contains details of five hits that Vincent has to carry out in one night in Los Angeles.Vincent gets in a cab driven by Max (Jamie Foxx) and he gets his one slice of luck.As the audience gathers from his earlier fare, prosecutor Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith.) Max knows his way around the city. Vincent needs someone like Max in a night like tonight where time is of the essence. He offers Max $600 for the night claiming that he is here for a real estate deal.In the first stop a body lands on the roof of his cab. Max soon realises that his passenger was the cause of the death. If he wants to stay alive, Max needs to go where Vincent wants to where he can carry out his hits.However the police soon realise that something is amiss as the bodies pile up in the morgue.Cruise shines as the charming but chilling sociopath Vincent. There is stone cold scene in a jazz club, where you think Vincent has taken Max to relax and take his mind off what is happening.Foxx manages to keep up with Cruise. The everyman who takes pride in his job and has a dream for a better life. His own limousine company.Mann does have flaws with the story and they just cannot be covered up. Vincent is supposed to be a smooth efficient and invisible hitman. His clients do not know who Vincent is.

Why? What are you going to do about it?,"Collateral is directed by Michael Mann and stars Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. It's written by Stuart Beattie, scored by James Newton Howard and the cinematographer is Dion Beebe. It's set in Los Angeles, California and takes place on the night of January 24 to 25, 2004 from 6:30 PM to 5:40 AM.Max (Foxx) is in a job rut as a taxi driver, he constantly dreams of a better life. Tonight his life will change when he picks up the smartly attired Vincent (Cruise), who is in town for one night, an assassin with five stops to make.By the time of Collateral's release, Michael Mann had firmly established himself as a purveyor of slow burn intensity with the likes of Heat & The Insider. Collateral is no different. In what is essentially a two hander featuring two polar opposite characters sharing the same space, the film is like a tightly coiled spring just waiting to explode. Though the original casting for Vincent and Max was to be Russell Crowe and Adam Sandler respectively, the final casting turns out to be a master stroke. Pitting one of the biggest stars in the world against a young comedian turned actor makes the story ooze credibility. While simultaneously it provides the buddy buddy genre with one of its oddest, yet most rewarding, couplings. But as good as both actors are (Cruise trademarks as he lets Foxx thrive), this really is about its talented director.Shooting it on digital video (using the Viper FilmStream High-Definition Camera to be exact), Mann instills a colourful noir essence to his shady story. Be it the LA skyline or shots of road crossing coyotes, the low light colouring effects cloak the story with a bleakly atmospheric sheen. Particularly in relation to Vincent, where he may be smart and well spoken, the utter professional in fact, but he is icy cold, and Mann & Beattie frame him just right. The writing, too, is smart. There is no need to enter into psychological realms of the Vincent make up, it's purposely left alone, why he does what he does is not known. He throws a curve ball statement or two, but do you believe him? Does Max? It's all as grey as Cruise's hair is for the film (looking like a chilly Richard Gere actually) and it makes for better rewards when the finale arrives.There's also the other things that have become Mann trademarks, that of his astute musical cues and action set piece constructions. Here he again does not disappoint with a night club gun battle sequence that's as consummate as it gets. He's also aware that the film has to get out of the cab, in spite of it metronomically working so well, at some point to drive the narrative forward. This is where the minor players play big parts! Mark Ruffalo and Peter Berg's coppers, Bruce McGill's FBIer and Javier Bardem's gangster type, all serve to flesh the story and further the characterisation of assassin and chauffeur. There's a slight misstep in the finale with a coincidence that is not befitting such a meticulous director. But if we have learned one thing from Michael Mann, it's that he is not lazy, so an error of judgement is on this occasion easily forgiven.One of the best film's of 2004 from one of the modern eras finest auteur directors. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of Cruise's Finest Performances,"Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a ruthless, yet cool and calculating killer, Max (Jamie Foxx) is a cabbie. A quirk of fate throws the pair together when Vincent uses Max's cab as transport between hits.The result is a first rate thriller that is totally compelling and thoroughly entertaining. Despite Vincent's relentless and cold nature the viewing audience will still find it hard to dislike him, and this is due to the fantastic character portrayal that Cruise pulls off.Michael Mann's direction is as good as you have come to expect, with films such as (Last of the Mohicans, Heat and Ali) and even though he didn't write this, that doesn't detract from the movie experience.It would be wrong of me not to mention the performance of Jamie Foxx, as it is also great.Overall Collateral is a top film, and a must see for thriller fans.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Intense,"This was the movie I had been anticipating all summer. Tom Cruise as an assassin, and I love good against-type casting. This movie is an intense roller-coaster ride with excellent atmosphere supplied by Mann, and two great performances from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, and sprinkled with character performances from Mark Ruffalo, Javier Bardem, Bruce McGill, Peter Berg, and Irma P. Hall.Foxx, without any underlying comic edge to his performance, is perfect as the mild-mannered cab driver named Max, a man who has memorized the fastest routes to any destination in LA and dreams of opening a fancy limousine service. After dropping off a young assistant district attorney (Jada Pinkett Smith), he picks up Vincent (Cruise), and so begins their night of killing.With some serious 5 o'clock shadow, silvery-gray hair and matching chrome suit, Tom Cruise is playing a much older person than before. He is totally devoid of sympathy for the dead, and is convinced that what he is doing is right, or at least acceptable. In some odd way, the very things that make him such a heartless person, almost redeem him, as we know that this sociopath isn't just a cartoon of someone, but morally bankrupt about what he does. He's been contacted by a drug trafficker named Felix (Bardem) to kill five people.They travel throughout Los Angeles making Vincent's rounds. The digital photography helps to give the movie a documentary feel. The film is gritty and realistic feeling. The last few minutes betray this, to some effect, when Vincent becomes almost super-human, but he goes out nicely, in a way that is somewhat improbable, but nonetheless appropriate.This film will likely (or hopefully) garner nominations for the two leads and the director. It's a stylish piece of work that works more like a horror movie than a thriller. In the theater I found it difficult to breathe as the intense action and suspense kept elevating. There was always a part of me--don't as me why--that was rooting for the bad guy, but he still scared me. Maybe it's when you take that Tom Cruise charm and twist it around into a bad thing.",,Anonymous,Crime
I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was!,"I saw 'Collateral' tonight & I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It was entertaining, tightly-wound thriller with several unforeseen twists. There were some highly funny moments where I & other audience members laughed. This isn't a comedy by any means, more like humor breaking up a tense situation or laughing because a character has personality traits or a favorite saying that's funny.Tom Cruise did his usual solid performance, but Jamie Foxx just hit it right out of the park. He is very talented with a great acting range. I now look forward to seeing the Ray Charles biopic he is starring in soon. The rest of the cast did very well, especially Javier Bardem (bad guy Felix) and Barry 'Shabaka' Henry (jazz musician Danny). The only poor performances, IMHO, were Bruce McGill playing a by-the-book-case-taking-over FBI agent and Peter Berg as the flashy detective who can't be bothered by details that don't add up. They are both usually good performers.The relationship between Max (Foxx) & Vincent (Cruise) is cerebral & intense. In the inside of the cab, you watch as Vincent spins his web, and Max is compelled (for a variety of different reasons) to do what he asks. In one of the key moments of the film, there is a big confrontation between the two, and I thought, 'It's too early for the big showdown.' That's when the movie 'kicked it up a notch.'I had read on some sites that the music was too loud & the camera work was too busy, but I found both enjoyable. The movie was shot in a frenetic style that did make me a little motion-sick once or twice!I definitely recommend this movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Fantastic Thriller,"Normally when I watch a film, I tend to know quite a bit about it. Not like spoilers or anything, but I tend to know the premise, most of the cast, director etc. So it was kind of nice to just watch a film solely on a recommendation knowing very little about it, and to come out loving it. Tom Cruise plays against type brilliantly here, but it is Jamie Foxx who carries this film. He very much acts as the audience being introduced to this world, and he pulls off the more tense moments perfectly. The visual style is so striking and great to look at, and the action is shot really smoothly. The score is great and the character relationships were surprisingly strong. The fact that this is really just a character piece about Max not grabbing his chances in life makes this more fun to watch, mainly because I found myself really caring for Max's character and wanting him to escape the situation. The ending was really satisfying - I enjoy it when films end on an open-ended note, allowing the audience to fill in what might have happened to the characters. The only major issues is that some of the characters are a bit stupid - the cops had numerous chances to catch Vincent and just didn't for whatever reason. There were also a couple of predictable moments, but overall this is a fantastic film, and one I really, really enjoyed on top of that. Definitely give it a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Mann picked the right character to play Vincent. Before Mann retires, he better make another movie with Cruise. Maybe have Cruise for Heat 2.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Yin, Yang, and I Ching","Collateral is part action thriller and part high concept, existentialist psychological drama.  As a thriller, it works okay but for me the best parts are when they are sitting around in the taxi talking.  This is one of the rare films where someone put a lot of thought into the script before turning it into a film.  Who would of thought that Stuart Beattie, who wrote one of the Mummy scripts, could actually write an intelligent (dare I say intellectual) script?Vincent is the epitome of evil but he justifies himself to Max and in some regards, he is right.  Vincent might be evil but he is a doer.  Max is a dreamer.  Max is always trying to do the right thing but given a choice, he would just as well keep things the way they are.  Max needs everything to be perfect while Vincent likes to improvise.  Because they are opposites, they need each other.  Neither man seems to have much intimacy in their life and they seem intent on trying to convince the other on the legitimacy of their views.Upon first viewing, you are caught up in the thriller part of the story and it's hard to notice the nuances and symbolism.  On subsequent viewings you can pay more attention to the psychological details and surreal elements. For instance, at one point Max actually becomes Vincent.  In several parts of the film, Vincent is helping Max and acts as sort of a malevolent benefactor.  It is at these levels of the film that make it so special.  The film also has some genuinely funny moments; it does not take itself too seriously.Los Angeles late at night is an eerie, seductive and beautiful place and the filmmakers capture it well.  The action parts are adequate but it is the quiet passages that make this film special.  The acting, script, photography, music, and directing are all first rate.  It works well as a thriller but is even better as a psychological drama.  I consider this an instant classic.  10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good exercise of Michael Mann,"""Collateral"" is worth to watch, because Michael Mann is a very interesting author, because of the cast and of the technical aspect. The film is not a classic like ""Heath"" (with de Niro and Pacino), ""Collateral"" is more mainstream -and it's true that the two main characters have some clichés: Foxx is the honest man who has a hearth, Cruise is the killer without mercy because it takes the killing like a real job. Apart from that, the plot is interesting (everything happens in one night: a taxi driver becomes hostage of a dangerous assassin). Los Angeles by night is the context of a kafkian story. The shots are all made with digital cameras. I think the film is a good exercise of the director, a good thriller... You see it for having fun and you get what you want. Actors are good, especially Tom Cruise (here is uglier and, above all, a baddie!)

Cruise is the Perfect Bad Guy,"really enjoyed Collateral. Tom Cruise's character Vincent is a contract killer who uses an innocent Taxi Driver named Max played by Jamie Foxx, to drive him around town as he kills his victims. Vincent assures Max that these are all ""bad people"" but as the story goes on you realize Vincent can't be trusted with anything he says.Tom Cruise plays this evil character with a lot of depth and complexity. You start to see that he is actually very warped and evil. Jamie Foxx's character starts to wonder just how psycho this person is and you can tell he realizes this situation is getting worse and worse.Jada Pinkett Smith plays the Attorney who rides with max before Vincent. She and Max flirt and it creates a very interesting plot twist. Mark Ruffalo plays a detective trying to hunt down the killers of the murder victims. Ruffalo was so good in his role, that at first I didn't even realize it was him.I could see an Oscar nomination for Tom Cruise with this movie.

"not the best Mann, but still a man to watch","I agree with all those reviews that pan Collateral's script, there's simply nothing in it that you haven't seen before and that you didn't expect. Worse still, you expected it crisper, taut. It's hard to find enough tension going on between Vincent and Max because there's no interplay between Vincent and Max, there's Vincent playing with Max, poor Max is taking it up the derrière most of the time.How Max can manage such docility is hard to get, because Vincent, after all, is a pro but not a brute, he's a gentleman round the edges, which ends up marring the whole thing. Neither fish nor meat. The actors are good, though and although Mann doesn't seem particularly concerned with improving the script's underdevelopment he's got enough talent in him to make it a watchable and occasionally warm thriller. And there's LA... Never been there but the mann sure looks at her with a lover's eye but does he trust his woman?",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Originally called 'The Last Domino' and heavily rewritten by both Frank Darabont and Michael Mann, it asks the questions: ""So what happens if you're a cab driver and a sociopath gets into the car?"" So it goes. The sociopath is played by Tom Cruise and it's a part that he's essentially made for. The guy has the capacity to be both utterly charming and utterly cold at the same time and I think he's probably managed to frighten quite a few people in his life. Jamie Foxx is the cabdriver, and what makes his performance so riveting is his capacity to be down on himself while aspiring higher, to be humbled and humbling, and essentially be a lot like probably you and me. It's the dichotomy between these two convergent personalities that make this film work. The actual storyline, while interesting, is at a loss towards the final third of the film, when it devolves into shoot-em-up bang-bang and the cab driver becomes something other than what his character's been the entire film. Also, the coincidences needed to make this script hum might make you wish you watched less movies. Don't think too much and just enjoy the bits of this film that work, because there are a few of them and they are quite enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Bad, frosted Michael Mann hair","For one thing, if anybody believes that squeaky-clean Tom Cruise is a hit man, they need to get their heads examined. And his hair frosted sliver like that. Puh-leese....Halloween, anybody? (laughs)And Jamie Foxx spends the whole time grimacing and making faces for the camera. This is the guy who won the Oscar last year, right???And of course you have to have a Halle Berry-type in the form of Jada Pinkett Smith that Jamie Foxx has to save. Now why would a high-priced lawyer like her be interested in a flunkie cab driver like Jamie Foxx? More standard same-ol same-ol, I guess... (yawn...)I thought that was idiot Will Smith's job? No?The cliché ending is typical. Now if Mann went for a shocker like in Se7en, I'd go up a few marks and be mighty impressed.But naww, he played it safe. No mo silver frosted hair.It's also shot using a DV camera instead of film. Is there something wrong with film? Please go back to film until they can make digital look like film and not digital. I suppose all the techno Gen Y types thinks it looks good, but I think the whole lighting and camera thing looks like crap, especially on the big screen. I thought I was going blind since everything seemed out of focus. Maybe it looks better on DVD. Who knows...Sorry Mann but you blew it. Grade: F2 out of 10",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Thrilling with so much depth,"Seeing Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx in a film together got me wanting to see this for a long time and I have to say, I really loved it.Collateral follows Max, a cab driver who becomes the hostage to a contract killer named Vincent as he takes him from one hit to another during one night in Los Angeles.This is my first time seeing a Michael Mann film and I honestly cannot wait to see what else he has made. I had high hopes for Collateral but did not expect to like it this much. What really caught my eye was Collateral's depiction of LA night life. The atmosphere of the night adds to the tension as we're taken through dark, abandoned streets and alleyways that drum up the thriller aspect of the film. The scenes inside the taxi create tension and claustrophobia as we're on edge thinking about what move Vincent is going to make. Mann does a terrific job introducing both characters in the beginning. When we first see Vincent, there is a feeling of mystery surrounding his character. When we're introduced to Max, Mann gives us enough character development for us to connect with his character and care about him for the rest of the film. Some of the best scenes include Vincent and Max talking to each other in the taxi. We get a better view of their personas and history. Their conversations are so interesting to listen to due to how deep and philosophical they get over time.The acting from Tom Cruise is terrific. We normally see him playing the hero and a good guy so it's refreshing to see him on the other side of the spectrum. He's fun to watch in the action scenes but I feel he truly shines during those scenes in the taxi with Jamie Foxx's character. I hope he plays more villainous roles like this one in the future. Jamie Foxx also gives one of his best here. He does a great job making Max a likeable person. His character goes through a lot and Foxx conveys all the right emotions required. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as usual and Jada Pinkett Smith also does a great job.Collateral is a well made drama thriller. The script is well written as we learn so much about our two leads and the glorious portrayal of LA night life keeps the thrills going. Michael Mann's direction is superb as well as the acting by Cruise and Foxx which make Collateral an entertaining watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A wild ride!,"Life couldn't get any easier for Max (Jamie Foxx) as night after night he drives a cab and can't get his dream of owning a limo business, but his night is about to become even worse ""Collateral"" starts off slow with Tom Cruise's character Vincent walking with a luggage from an airport with his frosted hair, dark shades and a silver suit as a man trips over him, Vincent tells him ""Are you alright?"" With just his look, he means business. Also in the beginning, Max drives a workaholic lawyer named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) for whom he tells her if he takes Annie to her firm in time, then she doesn't have to pay the fare. He wins the bet, but she exchanges her phone number while Max gives her his lucky postcard to remind her of relaxation.After that, the thrill ride begins as Vincent goes into the cab and offers Max six-hundred dollars to take him for an all night ride in which case becomes a killing spree. In a comic relief, Vincent tells Max ""This is the cleanest cab I've ever seen."" Not for long.In the film, Vincent is working for a mafia crime boss for which he must assassinate five different people (a drug dealer, a jazz player, a business man, a Chinese millionaire and a lawyer) who are witnesses from his boss's case. And throughout the night, he goes on a killing spree shocking Max for his dear life; but Vincent doesn't want any witnesses so Max becomes his hostage that entire night and doing exactly what he tells him. Especially when Max's mom is in the hospital, Vincent tries to be boy charming by buying her flowers and letting the nurses keep the change; even finding the truth that Max has been lying to her.What's interesting about the character Vincent is that though he's a killer, he is more of an aid towards Max as he tries to get for him be more confident towards the dispatcher on the radio (his boss) who has been treating him like dirt; not to mention be more aggressive as Max pretends to be Vincent when seeing the boss that Vincent works for.Though I've only seen one Michael Mann film (Heat), what I really like about this movie is that he shows the entire city of Los Angeles at night; the atmosphere is very realistic it is, as if we've become characters in it.""Collateral"" is a scary ride from minute one where the suspense never ends, not to mention the performances from Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise for which is kind of weird since Foxx is a comedian (""In Living Color"", Booty Call) and Cruise has always played the hero (Mission: Impossible, The Last Samurai); this is a match made in heaven.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of Tom Cruise's best turns.,"Collateral features an amazing turn by megastar Tom Cruise in a negative shade. This is a great work by Michael Mann whose decision to shoot at night(this is an all-nighter movie) gives the film an atmosphere that is exceptional and unique. Shot on the streets of Los Angeles Cruise plays a contract killer who hires a taxi and goes about offing people systematically. Jamie Foxx plays the taxi driver and his banter with Cruise form the majority of the running time. The dialogues are good- snappy as well as thought provoking as and when the need arises, the pacing is excellent and direction, as expected from a master filmmaker is top notch. If you are used to seeing Cruise in positive heroic roles Collateral will give you a pleasant surprise.",,Anonymous,Crime
I can't drive you around while you're killing folks. It ain't my job!,"Collateral is a nice enough film. If it was an indie film, it'd of had a different ending for sure. But who cares, Tom Cruise chooses a good part, and his dynamic, dry & hardened characters make good entertainment. It's nice to see him play immorale roles, maybe next time he could choose a less driven character, like a slacker for instance.My only gripe is, I thought the cab driver was a little cliché, I think in the city of Angels most cabbies would've taken the money and shut up, instead of whining.The film carries subtle truths of man's worth to the world, why we're here? How insignificant we really are, easy come easy go, you get the feeling the writer or director is driving this home to the viewer as Vincent does with Max, I thought that was a nice addition to the film.Some pretty camera work, it gives a good feel of Los Angeles and the vast jungle it is.I enjoyed it.~Paul Browne",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

And ""Collateral"" just proves all of this.Containing various elements from noir film's (my favorite genre), this is a powerful dark look at contemporary L.A. at night. Micahel Mann, as always, does an excellent job in analyzing each characters emotional state during the various different moments of the film.With an awesome performance by Cruise, and even better by Foxx, the film really catches you, just can't run away from the story!

"Good, but not quite up to snuff for Michael Mann","I heard the plot outline and thought to myself this doesn't have the makings for a good movie. Why would a hit man choose a cabbie to drive him around? Why would this be interesting? But, I had similar thoughts before seeing ""The Insider"" - why would a movie about a corporate whistle blower be interesting. Now, ""The Insider"", along with ""Heat"", ""The Last of the Mohicans"", and ""Manhunter"" are some of my favorite movies.After seeing Collateral, I surprisingly really didn't have a problem with the issue of why a hit-man would have a cabbie drive him around from hit to hit. But, it didn't live up to other Michael Mann movies that I love. It seemed like a long version of an RHD episode.If you want an entertaining movie, this will suffice.

Vincent is one cold mo-fo,"The concept to this movie is endearingly simple: cab driver picks up a contract killer, then tries to figure out how not to get killed. In between he also drives him to places to kill some other people. It's not the greatest of plots, but that's irrelevant when the execution is so great. I always adore seeing Tom Cruise as a villain, this man was made to be evil. Just check out his composure during the nightclub scene, Tom Cruise just has no business being nice. Jamie Foxx is also very good as the voice of reason throughout all the crazyness, he portrays a character you can really side with and you even don't really want him to die. Michael ""Heat"" Mann is probably as close to Hitchcock as this generation will ever get, and ""Collateral"" definitely contains some real gems when it comes to suspense. To me the absolute highlight is the jazzman scene, I could watch it over and over again for days straight. It's just perfect, the way it's built up is so brilliant. The only bad thing about ""Collateral"", the only thing that keeps it from being one of my absolute favorites, is the silly ending. It doesn't fit the movie, and it seems a lot like something the producers came up with long after the script was green-lit. A disappointing end to an otherwise fantastic movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Collateral keeps things on edge,"Director Michael Mann delivers in the guise of an urban thriller, an intriguing character study of contrast between good and evil in Collateral. Tom Cruise changes pace by playing a hitman with a nasty streak, and Jamie Foxx has the straight man role as a cab driver.  Essentially a Hitchcockian premise with a perverse twist, the film begins with Foxx as the innocent bystander-type working one night driving his taxi who picks up Cruise without realizing that the two are embarking on a methodical murder of five targets.  Gradually, the L.A. police led by Mark Ruffalo realize that the growing pile of bodies is connected to a taxicab.  While it goes on a bit too long at one point, Collateral picks up steam in the last one-third of the film and sustains a strong level of suspense and angst as Foxx races against time to prevent one last murder that hits close to home.Even with a plot that is quite simple, Mann uses Los Angeles to paint a large canvas in much the way directors Martin Scorsese and Sidney Lumet utilize New York City as almost a third character.  All of the trademark glitz and glitter in cinematography and imaginative editing we have come to expect from Mann are on display.  Has it really been almost two decades since TV's Miami Vice?  As expected, contemporary dance music and evocative mood instrumentals flesh out the scenes effectively.  Mann has always demonstrated a strong command of soundtrack music.  Collateral shares some of the same pedigree as his earlier heist epic, Heat.  In both films, a basic plotline is heightened by interesting character contrasts between two men-one good and the other bad.Although the dialogue between Foxx and Cruise is the crux of the film, it ranges from witty to intense to mediocre at times. One wishes the script had one more pass to punch it up so that by the time the finale rolls around, there is a bit more poignancy and irony which the filmmakers surely intended.  There are a few lapses of logic and credibility especially toward the end but the story moves along sufficiently to keep one engaged.Cruise is effective as a baddie, but it is Foxx who shines in a more challenging role.  He had a memorable turn in Oliver Stone's football epic, Any Given Sunday, and here he is given ample room to broaden his range as an actor.  It is certain that he will attain more dramatic roles in the future. Jada Pinkett Smith, as an attorney who has a fateful encounter with Foxx, rounds out a solid cast.Given that the action sequences are brutal yet brief, it is remarkable that for the most part, the film sustains its fatalistic mood and tension while entertaining the audience with its two lead characters.  Tom Cruise fans will find this a curious footnote in his filmography and Michael Mann followers will soak up the riches of his filmmaking prowess.  Collateral is a feast for the eyes and ears with just enough substance and character in between.",,Anonymous,Crime

Locked In and On Target,"I like to hand this movie to my friends and tell them this is one of my favorites. Their response is always something along the lines of 'But... It has Tom Cruise in it.' That fella sure does seem to be picking up momentum on the hate train. After watching this movie, I respect him. Still, he doesn't make this movie. It's the whole package. I liked it more than most, granted. But most people will agree that this movie is at least GOOD.Even today the film has a unique feel. Come to find out, this is because of the early all-digital shoot they did. On a Thomson Viper HD camera, I believe. Why does this matter? Shooting all digital back in 2004 was a feat in itself. But beyond that, they digitally adjusted the shoots to have a really natural field of color. The setting of nighttime LA is captured beautifully. This does have its downsides as sometimes graininess will show up.The DP does some nifty camera work. Its not so much a 'shaky-cam' as it is a 'pannycam(?)'... The camera likes to move itself. Its fun to watch and is really unusual.I've already mentioned Cruise's commendable role, but Jamie Foxx nailed his as well. The BEST thing about this movie is the uneasy relationship of their characters. The cautious interaction between them. How Cruise's killer is always trying to get his looser cabbie to talk and open up. Most of it comes back to the dialog, I suppose. Also worth mentioning is that Javier Bardem has a nice little role in here too.The most noticeable problem, after watching it a few times, lies in the pacing. Every time we get 2/3 through the movie I feel a lull. This was recognized in the editing. And they did the smartest move in the book. They rolled with it, and built up our expectations of the promise of violence set to the soothing, but volatile sound of Audioslave's ""Staring at the Sun"".Its may masterpiece to me, but certainly worth anyone's viewing. Don't let people's overreaction to supposed plot holes keep you from missing out of an excellent ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
so-so Michael Mann,"I was a little disappointed in ""Collateral"". I don't think it should be on anyone's ""top ten"" list for '04. Maybe I'm finally tiring of this gender, maybe I'm finally immune to these over-the-top, super-violent movies. It was not plausible from the get-go, and the story took about an hour-and-a-half before I finally became immersed in it's drama. Tom Cruise was impeccable as the cold-blooded killer, and Jamie Foxx did well, but so what....the story was just not inventive enough. Mark Ruffalo continues to amaze me with his chameleon-like screen presence. He's so different from movie-to-movie; I stare in bewilderment, realizing it's the same guy. He's as hot as anyone in Hollywood right now. But alas, in this one, he just isn't given a chance to develop the character, though the role as the only smart cop on the chase begs for a more defining presence written into it.When compared to an earlier L.A-based drama ""Heat"", Michael Mann comes up short. ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""The Insider"" were considerably better Mann movies, as well. Better luck next time.footnote: I liked Denzel Washington's ""Man on Fire"" a lot better (another over-the-top violence flick), though I doubt it got better reviews.

Flawless and Taught,"Michael Mann (HEAT & THE INSIDER) creates a film with the ultimate LA at night feel, interweaving streets, lights, common everyday mundane activities to build a near perfect suspense thriller with little or no gaps or flaws. Perfectly believable as a crime flick and even better as a character study this film entertains in many different ways. Worth a look or two.Tom Cruise (TOP GUN) is pitch perfect as an over the top assassin but the real spotlight shines on Jamie Foxx (ANY GIVEN Sunday) who not only steals the movie but carves deeper the notch in his acting belt showing his talent as a believable everyday guy. While a lot of the film is emotionally driven and the action in this film is limited but rapid fire and brutal, I really enjoyed the pacing and never once felt a moment when the movie slowed or stalled out. It had perpetual motion until the last moments.

"""Hey homie...Is  that my briefcase?""","The best of thrillers so far in the beginning of this 21st century. Both leads Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx put in all their moxie into these roles and the result are velvet-smooth performances. Director Michael Mann elected to use high-definition for this because hi-def picks up the lights in the L.A. cityscape at night and provides a crisp, contrasting image (which it does the polar opposite to with daytime photography). The dialogue is taut and loose, and NEVER boring. Even when Vincent (Cruise) points out to Max (Foxx) that ""driving a cab for 12 years isn't temporary"" when Max explains his dream to him about opening up his own limousine service, he illustrates that point to where the audience would agree and would be unable to fully hate him.The premise is simple, although not realistic. But because it sounds/seems so outrageous, I could actually see someone in Vincent's position resorting to this technique temporarily, though. Vincent is a hired gun who needs to dispatch 5 material witnesses to a federal drug trial in one night. One out of the five works for the U.S. Attourney General's office (Jada Pinkett-Smith). Foxx is a cab driver who has her for his fare just before meeting up with Cruise, and is unaware that she's on his hit-list. Cruise uses public transportation as a ruse to complete his mission rather than having to worry about getaway car-descriptions, license plate numbers, etc. After the first hit, Max wants out (Vincent has bribed him already to help him ""close some deals"") even though he has no choice but to play ball for his life. He uses his charisma to get them to point A to points B, C, D, and so on. After Foxx impulsively hucks over Cruise's briefcase full of files/ data/money, Cruise has Foxx take them to a seedy nightclub in East L.A. to retrieve what was lost through a computer chip. Felix (played by an unrecognizable Javier Bardeem and dons a gray suit and white shirt just like Cruise does) is furious, and has Foxx (whom he thinks is Vincent) followed by his goons. It's a chase from that point on and Cruise never seems to lose it until towards the end by reassuring himself as he screams to Foxx that he does this kind of thing for a living.This would of received a higher rating from me had they allowed Tom Cruise's character to live. Seriously. Like he gets away with it, and Max starts his limo company and there's a moral in their amorality. There is a lot of philosophy to it in regards to dreams and ambition, and points of view about death and murder. So an ending like that would be, to me, quite fitting. But it was still well-done, and you know that Jamie Foxx's character walks away from this at the end with just a little more purpose and urgency in his ambition.I can even see him playing Morgan Freeman's ""Shawshank Redemption"" quote over in his head: ""Get busy living, or get busy dying...""",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another missed opportunity,"Well, another disappointment by Michael Mann. Just had the flick on a DVD from my library. Well, it is very well filmed, a gift that Mr. Mann has given proof of already back in the early 80ies. However, I am wondering if he does think that people who watch films must be mindless creatures. As a producer and director he should have toppled such an unrealistic and stupid script, and as he was obviously involved in the financing of this film, i am sure he would have had the means to. I have no intention to become a professional murderer, but if i wanted to, i would never accept 5 hits per night (maybe Vincent was offered an extra bonus or whatsoever......(. I can only advise any potential hit-man would be, don't do it! Look into yourself, become a script writer, even if you f*** it up, you will never go to prison, on the contrary, you might get seriously wealthy, legally!!!!!! (This statement does also apply to Directors, Actors,Producers, etc. etc.......)The worst flaw, our dear screenwriter wants us to swallow is that a Professional Criminal on a secret mission, would be stupid enough to clinch to a simple minded cab driver till the bitter end,and threatening him to death all the time, not only with his firearm but, maybe even more, with his rather department-store-like philosophy.I think there is a good film about the same topic, i think it's a Don Siegel film and is called ""The line up"". Virtually the same plot, but definitely better written and with inherent logic which ""Collateral"" is in desperate shortage of.Now, let us stop complaining, as i mentioned at the beginning, it is very well filmed. Mr. Mann really is a visual person, and my biggest surprise was, that the ""intimate"" scenes in the Cab don't make you yawn..........!!!!!! So he must now how to handle Actors, maybe he will take an additional class in Script-plausibility....Nevertheless, a missed opportunity, though i hope that the Producers and Investors were able to get their money back.

Collaboration,"Starts a tad slow establishing Jamie Fox's character, which it does effectively with the support of Jada Pinkett Smith's presence as an at first seemingly random sub-plot character. Then it builds to the coerced cooperation with Cruise as a deadly professional hit man who is able to assess and weaponize the vulnerabilities of Fox's character, who is able to rise to the occasion when forced to utilize manipulative skills of his own.Even with the dyed hair, Cruise did not shake off his mission-impossible / Jack Reacher persona and the lingering expectation of a noble anti-hero which in this effort he is not but rather a bad guy to the bone; even so, factored in to the mystery and teased along with the support of Mark Ruffalo as an inquisitive detective, it practically works.Fox's unlikely hero contrasted with Cruise's super villain in a confluence of circumstances is done well towards overcoming the convoluted awkwardness of it all.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A genuine surprise: a subtle and impressive action film,"Michael Mann's 'Collateral,' is a genuine surprise and one of the best movies I've seen in years. Offering a refreshing change from the standard fare, it might not be for everyone.Under Michael Mann's direction, Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox break out of the standard action mold to create a deeply-engaging character study with the trappings of an action movie and its technique is reminiscent of fiction from a cleverer age. There is much to the movie that you could imagine having been written by a modern day Jack London. Cruise is a horribly competent paid killer, while Fox is a cabdriver, bound by his dreams of escape and by escape into his dreams-a man who has been driving a cab for twelve years and yet tells anyone who'll listen that it's 'only temporary.' Together, they work to show you what the best screen writing is: the actions of characters under the pressure of action and the effect of who they are on what they do. The contrasts and their effects are brilliant; they drive and inform the movie on a dozen levels, changing what might have been a roles that could have been handled by, say, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Will Smith into something that required more and that the actors delivered. Cruise's Vincent is an edge-player of the first water-tasked with killing five government witnesses in a federal drug case-and he is raw: a cynical and amoral animal intelligence driving all the muscle needed to back it up; an ex-special forces soldier 'in the private sector' who's only question is 'how?'. He bets his life on plans made in less time than it takes to read this sentence. Jamie Fox's Max is a style of everyman that everyone will recognize: Vincent's counterpart. He has intelligence but no drive. He has plans but he waits to execute them until the time is right and the circumstances 'perfect'-a man who is killing time and not realizing that time is returning the favor. For Vincent, Max is a resource, someone he can coerce and manipulate; the most effective way of getting from the scene of one crime to another, until the pressure pushes Max and twists him. When all is said and done, Collateral is a Mann movie, an unmistakably male movie; pure yang, shot through with stroboscopic flashes of intense and quirkily precise violence. The pistol becomes an icon in Cruise's hands, making you believe in his character and making you happy that you aren't in front of him. All in all, Mann's 'Collateral,' is something seen all too rarely in today's world of globalized profit-seeking: a thinking man's action movie with characters whose eyes have whole lives behind them whose words mean things and whose actions draw you in..",,Anonymous,Crime

Where oh where do I begin!,"'COLLATERAL' was directed by Michael Mann and stars Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise. ​Cab driver Max(Jamie Foxx)'s day is going well. He gets a lawyer(Jada Pinkett Smith)'s number and is offered $600 by a customer(Tom Cruise) to take him to 5 separate locations. Things begin spiralling out of control, however, when Max uncovers what the mysterious Vincent is really doing.Where do I god damn begin with this film? It is awesome, amazing, inventive and I highly, highly recommend it. All the performances are great, the story is riveting, the cinematography is out of this world; it is a masterpiece, plain and simple. I've only watched this film once but I am sure it will be just as riveting(if not more) with multiple re-watches and thus I intend to obtain the film as soon as possible. I've given my first impressions, let me go in depth.The story. The god damn story. It is excellent, genius writing and I loved it. Collateral is two movies in one. It is a tight, claustrophobic thriller between Vincent and Max while in the Cab, and the interplay between these two powerhouse performances is phenomenal. It is also a open thriller in the streets of Los Angeles, where Vincent is doing his thing. Both of these movies combine together to make one utter masterpiece of a script. I cannot praise it enough. The dialogue between the characters is fantastic. And the ending.The ending to this movie is one of the best ending I've seen in a long time. There is no dramatic twist. There is no shocking revelation. It is a pure, unfiltered clash of ideas between the main characters. I cannot flaw the last moments of the film; my jaw was on the floor for them. The buildup to these moments was genuinely terrifying and you have no clue what will happen. Truly an excellent screenplay - thank you Mann, Beatie and Loeb.Jamie Foxx has proved he can be a brilliant actor when given the right material. This movie has allowed me to forgive him for Electro. He is THAT good in this movie. He 100% deserved that Oscar nomination, he was brilliant in this movie. I'll also briefly comment on Max, our protagonist. Max isn't an ex-SAS soldier, he isn't a superhero, he isn't the best at anything - he is a normal cab driver and that is what makes his character so enjoyable to watch. Over the course of a single night, we watch how he changes and evolves and how he does what he must to survive. It is a fantastic portrayal of what someone will do when pushed to the edge and he is genuinely a brilliant character.Tom Cruise. Two words that let me know I will probably at least enjoy a movie. And he steals the show. It hurts me he wasn't nominated for an Oscar because this is, for me, one of his best performances he has ever given. Cruise never plays a villain and has always been typecast as the charismatic, charming hero. Not here. He is charismatic but certainly not charming. He is ruthless, cold blooded and, surprisingly, Cruise sells this role expertly. I can not envision another human in the role of Vincent because Cruise was just that great in the role. Cold, Calculating, brilliant. Three words to describe him.Some comments about Vincent as a character. As previously stated, we rarely see Cruise portray a villain. Vincent is the type of villain that starts of as likable and calm but slowly devolves into a true cold blooded killer. Vincent is relentless in this movie and that makes him genuinely terrifying. He will not stop, he has no remorse, he feels no emotion; he is The Cruisinator.Jada Pinkett Smith was perfectly adequate as Annie and I definitely bought the evolution of her relationship with Max. Overall a well done character but I don't know if she was 100% necessary to the movie. Probably just my opinion though.Mark Ruffallo's performance as Fanning also goes under the radar for many people in this movie which I think is wrong. Ruffallo gives a solid performance as Fanning and I was actually interested in what was happening when he was on screen.The cinematography in this movie could warrant 1000 words in and of itself so I will keep this pretty brief. Cinematography in this movie is beautiful. It is masterfully shot and edited and it is should be retroactively awarded an Oscar for Best Cinematography. Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron deserve at least that much for their masterfully crafted camera-work. It is truly exceptional how this movie is shot and directed. Visually stunning does not even quite cover it.This movie also has a great score, in case you were wondering.I mean if I haven't convinced you to go watch Collateral yet, I don't know what will. It is a great action movie. It is a fantastic thriller. It is a testament to how excellent movies are made and how movies should be shot. Don't delay seeing this movie any longer, you'll be glad you saw it. I'll rate this movie a flawless rating of 10 Cruisinators out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A tight thriller,"I think Tom Cruise is a good actor. Let this sink in for a while. Has he had a truly bad performance? Sure he's a little wooden and he relies on his smile a bit too much. We must remember that he was quality in Magnolia, Interview With A Vampire, Mission Impossable and Rain Man.Collatoral is another movie in which Tom shows us a few more strings to his fiddle. He plays an Ice Cold hit-man, 10 steps ahead of the game and a brain that literally calculates odds.Jamie Fox is brilliant; the leads connect very well; but don't spark as well as other couples in buddy movies.Cinematography is striking, the course the film takes is pacy and unpredictable. My main beef with the film is that it lacks an emotional core. We are not told a great deal about the characters and as a consequence, i couldn't care less about the finale of the film.Anybody else think of Terminator at the end of the movie?",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Way better than I thought it would be!,"Watching the trailer for this movie, I thought, ""Geez, why doesn't Jamie Foxx just DRIVE AWAY if he doesn't want to get involved w/ Tom? How STUPID!"", but then I got to see a preview screening of the film and, wow, did it change my mind in a hurry.The above problem is explained very thoroughly and the movie is just a SUPERIOR suspense thriller with fantastic performances by both leads, a what's-going-to-happen-next rush for the whole length of it, wonderful, tight camera shots and superior dialog that challenges its audience intellectually AND morally.One thing: I happened to be able to predict the ending, but it didn't detract too much and actually tied things together in a nice way.If you liked ""Changing Lanes"" - which is what this movie reminded me of most and which also had a HORRIBLE trailer - you will like ""Collateral"". If you DIDN'T like ""Changing Lanes"", you will like ""Collateral""! (Naw, just kidding on that last part, but it is pretty darn good and a real crowd-pleaser.)",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Collateral,"I thought this was a fantastic film. Where could this have gone wrong? With Michael Manns directing, Tom Cruise just at the top of his game giving a absolutely fantastic performance, and you mix in Jamie Foxxx and you have a fantastic top notch film. The film takes place in L. A. when the mafia brings in a hitman to commit several murders all in the course of one night. A good, kind hearted, honest man, that is a cab driver, unknowingly, is his driver for the night. He takes him around town and once he catches on he is not happy that he is brought into this. This is a wonderful film that I definitely would recommend if you haven't seen yet.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best thrillers in years!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, and Jada Pinkett-Smith all give top-notch performances. All of them are highly likable characters; even Cruise who plays a hit-man who appears unfeeling to his ""victims,"" while being ""caring"" to others, especially Foxx. What I liked about this is that it is different from most thrillers. It doesn't use the same tired tricks that other thrillers seem to use. (when someone appears dead, he is dead).There are some great dialogue exchanges with Cruise and Foxx as well as with Pinkett-Smith and Foxx.The movie never gets boring from beginning to end. This movie looks like a springboard for more roles for Foxx and Pinkett-Smith!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A fantastic movie,"Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and Jada Pinkett Smith all rise to the occasion in Collateral, and together they transcend their previous appearances on film. Mark Ruffalo gives a good performance as the cop who knows everything is not what it seems.The soundtrack is also excellent, with a mixture of popular music and ambient tracks perfectly-timed and synced to the story... tribal drumbeats during the chase scenes, haunting rock ballads at pivotal moments, and one track that reminded this viewer of the scene at the other end of Tom Cruise's career, when he drives his father's Porsche out of the garage in ""Risky Business"" to the accompaniment of a thumping synth track. A bizarre side-note, I know.As the movie builds to a climax, the police are hunting for Max, believing he is the one on a killing spree, and Vincent stalks his final victim in a blacked-out high-rise office to a backdrop of the brilliant LA skyline, reflected in multiplicity by the office's dozens of glass cubicles.There are a few minor plot points which didn't sufficiently suspend my disbelief (like when Max agrees to take Vincent the vicious hit-man to see his Mother in the hospital), but overall this is a fantastic movie.",,Anonymous,Crime
So predictable,"I watched this movie mostly because of very high rating and good reviews here in IMDb. So i expected quite a lot from that. Now, after watching it, i have calmed down. It wasn't any kind of historical masterpiece. Yes, Tom had some style as a bad guy indeed and there was some nice camera-work. But the script - it was boring and so predictable. Already after first killing, it was quite obvious, that Annie will be one of the targets. And in the end, Max will somehow kill Vincent. So i had to wait one hour, just to see, exactly how those things will happen. Such waiting, it is a sign of a bad thriller, isn't it?If this movie will get Oscar(s), i will be quite disappointed. And most certainly, Collateral is at least 1-1,5 points overrated here...",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cruise shows what he's made of.,"I must confess, that I am not a big fan of Michael Mann. He knows how to do films, there is no question about that, but sometimes he looses his control and his movies become pointedly annoying in some sense, like 'Heat', which was like a masturbatory tease of building a situation, where Pacino and Deniro were on a screen together.And yet 'Collateral' is very similar to Mann's other movies, but it still is different, as the pacing is far more faster, as the story happens during one night. But Mann still takes his time to reflect upon his characters from metaphorical scenes and images. The trademark music video scenes are intact and the action masterfully directed. The actors are good and the atmosphere is gripping. 'Collateral' is, even though the story line lefts some room for improvement, perhaps the best of Mann.Max (Jamie Foxx) is a taxi driver who picks up a fare, who introduces himself as Vincent (Tom Cruise) and makes him a offer of 700 bucks, if Max just drives him around the city for this evening. The thing is, that Vincent is a hit-man on a job.Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx do a astonishing job, and Cruise hasn't been this good since 'Magnolia': he's a perfect bad guy, a role he should play more often, as his calm, maniac approach on Vincet is extremely intriguing. Foxx is perfect counterpart for Cruise, and it is evident that he actually is the better actor of the two, but Cruise is the one who dominates the movie.The only thing not up to par in this tale is the plot line, which lets the infamous lady faith to do far too much convenient circumstances. It also leaves unexplained why so weathered hit-man as Vincent suddenly seems to forget to guard his back. But this is just nitpicking on a movie that is in its own right a good one. It is rare to see action oriented movie, that really works in other aspects besides the action scenes themselves.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Despite the plot's flaws, it's a good movie.","This film is a very competent thriller where an ordinary taxi driver ends up involved in a series of crimes, as his nightly passenger turns out to be a professional killer, hired to kill several people in one night. The plot starts from an excellent idea but the unfolding of the film reveals a lot of plot holes. This is its main problem. Gun shots that miss the target in a weird (but convenient) way, astonishing car crashes where no one gets hurt and other unrealistic or convenient situations complete the script's problems. The best in this film are the action scenes, truly capable of making us forget (or forgive) the mistakes I mentioned. The way the characters are presented and developed is also very good. Taxi driver Max is the most blatant example. In the beginning, he was perfectionist, dreamy and shy but he manages to overcome these blockades and face the problem where he was involved. This made him dear to the audience, who cares about his fate.The work of the actors is very positive. Despite being the most popular name in the cast, Tom Cruise deserves no more applause than Jamie Foxx, who shone in a way that didn't allow Cruise to dominate. In fact, it's unusual to see Cruise, an actor used to histrionic roles, in a character as calm and restrained, but that pleased me a lot. Jada Pinkett Smith plays the lady in distress satisfactorily, but it never ceases to be a cliché. Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem are also part of the cast, but the plot doesn't take much of their talent. Cinematography is very good, betting on close-up, aerial or scenes with the camera in motion, which gives greater movement to the film. Good special, visual and sound effects complete the good technical details of a film where only the screenplay is deficient. But event this is going to be a lesser evil if we get carried away by the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wow... This Was The Best Movie Of The Year,"I'm as surprised as you are. Make no mistake, I know Michael Mann is awesome and I knew the cast was good, but I wasn't expecting this film to be such a treat! Some things I noticed from the trailer that appeared to be possible strikes against proved very well used. This film knows exactly what to do with hand held digital cinematography.The story is a simple one. An LA cab driver who's letting life pass him by picks up the wrong fare. Cruise forces Foxx to take him around the city all night to perform various murders. The cops think Foxx is the murderer, but one detective doesn't buy it. The set up could have lead to a drab, standard action picture. A creative, naturalistic treatment results in a highly immersive, very enjoyable film. This film takes you to Los Angeles with complete texture- it's as if you're really there. The soundtrack is also awesome. The performances from the two leads are fantastic. All in all it is a thrilling and realistic film.And I wasn't joking when I said it's the best. No other film I've seen this year (and I've seen quite a few) can quite measure up to this one. This is the one that I can honestly say I have no reservations about.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mann film cruises on cool,"I love new plots in films. This is one of the reasons I loved Collateral. This is something only Mann could do in a fresh tight and slick screenplay, that steers a near flawless film. So so cab driver Foxx who acts well here, leads an ordinary life, driving the cleanest taxi in L.A. He's saving up for his dream of owning a limo business, that's if he ever gets it off the ground. In steps cool handsome Cruise, a hit-man for the mob, where soon these two are in conflict. After all Cruise is practically hijacking the taxi, forcing Foxx to drive around while he makes his kills, the last contract bringing a twist to it's identity, where to a truly intense race against time scenario, ensues. In his first bad guy role, Cruise shows real professionalism, as cool contract killer, Vincent, you actually can't help liking the guy. Despite his evil doings, he's a real character, who we learn about, so important in film. And it's not just Vincent. We are taken on this hairy journey, a fun thrill ride as only Mann could deliver. This movie was somewhat of a surprise, better than I thought it'd be as actually seeing it, before it hit cinema. Of course the cops get a dispatch, just as Foxx was about to open the trunk, as ordered by the cops. Just imagine if the cops didn't, how this film would of panned out. Again the music scores impress as they do in other Mann films. Foxx, Cruise, Pinkett all deliver in what is powerhouse entertainment, an exemplary film you should not miss out on. I hope we get to see Cruise play bad again, some day.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
It's Like That 'Gold & White Dress' All Over Again,"Some people have been loving this movie, some went further by calling it a masterpiece. And the others have been wondering why so many people, let alone loving, even liked this film. The dichotomy in scrutiny is significant.I've wondered the reason behind all of those 'over the top' ratings until the last 15 minutes. After that, I realized that those peeps who've been reviewing the movie must have just saw Tom Cruise and slapped those 10/10 ratings. There can't be any other reason.Cheesy and shallow philosophical arguments, Jamie Foxx's below-the-bottom acting and his pseudo-humanist character, plot holes that are bigger than the plot itself, trying too hard for a ironic climax and making Tom Cruise's bound to his character only subtle thing about this movie by acting as if the viewer is stupid by making the character explain the irony and so on.Only good thing about this movie is that it ends.

Gray Cruise in an ingeniously presented atmosphere!,"A throughout thrilling movie with a revolutionary plot and persuasive actors. In my opinion a brilliant Tom Cruise far away from his former roles. Including the fact that he had a perfectly matching partner in Jamie Fox who is apparently the best taxi driver in L.A. I guess Cruise enjoyed the ride in his cab more than he did. For a long time ""Collateral"" was a movie which was capable to grip me completely. Especially I loved the scene when Vincent pretended to be Max lawyer and warned Max boss that he better not pull this shit again. No more words about this awesome movie just watch it and enjoy it. Witty and thrilling a must see in every case even if you dislike Cruise what is rather unlikely.

Cruise control!!,"Michael Mann returns to the crime thriller for the first time since Heat and it's the genre that has garnered most of his fan base. I personally think he is a master at this genre as proved with Heat, Manhunter and Thief. This is a tense and superbly unique piece of work. Unique in the fact that it's shot on digital at night with no real conventional lighting in most of the film. In this respect the film has an original and highly atmospheric look. The night time setting of LA is at once both cold and warm and the subdued colour gives the film a really interesting tone.The plot centres around a cabbie named Max who picks up a passenger named Vincent. Vincent then in effect hijacks Max and his cab and has him take him around LA to wipe out federal witnesses. It's a simplistic premise and the film like Mann's other crime thrillers are fascinating character studies. The characters of both Max and Vincent are the core of the movie and the relationship between them. As you would expect this acting is top notch. Tom Cruise is brilliant, truly worthy of an Oscar nod. It's a brave role that manages to let Cruise shift the Cruise mantle he has upon him. Many of his roles, despite his excellent efforts still do feel like it is Tom Cruise there, but here he shakes his star status off and is completely immersed in an adverse character. It's so far form his image and he inhabits the role so brilliantly that we see him as the character and not as Cruise playing a character. There is no whiff of this being a star vehicle that at times tarnished an other wise exemplary performance in Last Samurai. Also Jamie Foxx is also excellent. He is an up and comer of real promise and already being talked up for an Oscar nod for his performance in Ray. Also offering good support is the gorgeous Jada Pinkett Smith.Mann as usual seems to effortlessly create style and tension and excite. His uber realistic approach really gives the film an edge with it's action. Cruise as the hit-man is every inch like a highly trained assassin. Authenticity is something that is always in evidence in Mann's work and it is clearly evident here. This is a brilliant piece of work. It's exciting, highly atmospheric and despite a far from original premise, feels unique. I hope that in a slow year for Oscar fodder, that this film will get appreciation for Cruise and Mann in particular. This is one of the best films this year. *****",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
What happened to plausibility?,"Having read a great review in the LA Times about Collateral, I was excited to see this film. Stylistically it is well done and captures the dark ""aloneness"" of LA. The acting for the most part was also good and very convincing. Where the movie falls apart is in credibility and plausibility. There is nothing more aggravating than watching what would appear to be the makings of a great action/thriller fall apart because of ridiculous ""Hollywood"" plot conventions. The viewer is able to write off a few implausible quirks in the beginning of this film but by the end, it is just way over the top, especially with Tom Cruise's character jumping on the train at the end. Can't imagine what the director had in mind when he shot this particular scene.

They do this for a living-- Good for Us,"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are electrifying in Michael Mann's powerful ""Collateral"". Director Mann brushes his canvas from a crisp, taut, and dark shockingly humorous screenplay by Stuart Beattie. Beattie has an acute ear for smart dialog, and dramatic twists. Michael Mann is a master storyteller, whose nocturnal Los Angeles is a visually stunning and enthralling character onto itself. ""Collateral"" spans one night. Mann's narrative is lean, intense, and transforms into a eloquent character study that is unexpectedly poignant. Mann also evokes amazing performances from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Cruise, playing against type, is powerful as Vincent. This is perhaps his best and most chilling performance.Mann and Beattie casually open ""Collateral"" as a collision of fate. We observe Vincent (Cruise), who arrives in LAX. Cruise looks differently: grayed hair and beard, gaunt, and icy cold. Max (Jamie Foxx) has been a cab driver in L.A. for 12 years. On this particular night he picks up a beautiful District Attorney, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith). Max tells Annie about his dreams of starting his own limousine service. She tells Max about her anxiety prior to her opening arguments on big court cases. Their talk is comfortable and flirtatious. Annie gives Max her business card. Before he can argue himself out of giving this gorgeous woman a call, Vincent gets in his cab. Vincent says he is in L.A. for a real estate deal, and has 5 stops to make. He will give Max $600 for the night, and a $100 bonus if he drives the entire night. Max reluctantly agrees. However, after a body crashes onto Max's cab, he realizes that he made a bad choice. Max says, ""You killed him?"" Vincent replies unflinchingly, ""No, I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him."" Yes, Vincent is a contract killer. Apparently, Vincent's ""real estate deal"" involves terminating witnesses in a major drug cartel indictment. Max, himself may become the victim of Vincent's collateral damage.Jamie Foxx is an awesome actor. His Max is doing his best to survive, and keep his wits about him. Foxx is believable as a man thrust into a seemingly no-win situation. Max at the beginning is holding on for dear life, being that Vincent is a sociopath and expert killer. Foxx as Max actually grows stronger from this unusual partnership with Vincent. The fact that Max brings along Vincent when he visits his Mom is a masterful touch. The captivating scenes in the cab with Foxx and Cruise, just talking, demonstrate their magical chemistry.Tom Cruise is powerful. One must acknowledge the risk he took in playing a cold professional killer which is so against type. His choice to play Vincent as a charismatic, intelligent, and charming character just slightly off moral north is brilliant. He never overplays the villain. Instead his Vincent has all the symptoms of a hero, but skewed toward darkness. Cruise gives Vincent an air of nobility, shrouded in manic rationalization. He tells Max, the people that he kills are really criminals. Cruise slowly unveils Vincent's past as the movie progresses in such a natural manner. Killing is a business for Vincent-- there is nothing personal. Cruise defends the line where Vincent's behavior is never justified, only understood. As Vincent, Cruise is both credible and deadly.Vincent is a professional cold hearted killer, who is terrifying. Cruise intensely trained for the fighting sequences, and they are performed expertly. Vincent dispatches his victims with a controlled brutality, and great style. The ""hit"" at the Asian nightclub is simply stunning. Tom Cruise's intensity and charisma are leveraged effectively in ""Collateral"".The final twist in ""Collateral"" is effective. Michael Mann's action movie, character study works on so many levels. He pulls the audience in from the first frame, and we can't take a breath until the last. Jada Pinkett Smith is very strong and charming as Annie. She holds her own with Foxx and Cruise. Jamie Foxx is a great actor. Tom Cruise gives a commanding and mesmerizing performance. He deserves an Academy Award nomination for his work here. And ""Collateral"" deserves to be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Gets worse with each viewing,"I recall seeing this years ago. Maybe because Jamie Foxx was getting Oscar hype. And I thought it was fairly cool. Probably because the Scion Tologist was playing something other than a pretty boy.When I saw it about a decade later I realized how ridiculous the climactic scenes are. Everything from the setup, to the warning call, to the characters' actions, to some super-natural eyesight. And all built upon the ''he's in the house"" type of horror-movie setup that was fresh for about 5 minutes 50 years ago.When I saw it again tonight the whole thing was absurd. It's hard to even know where to start, but let's stick to the cultist's character. He's supposedly a world-class hitman. Admittedly, I'm not a hitman myself. But I bet if I were I'd try to take care of business while creating a lot less hullaballoo than the mydgyt creates on this night of bloodshed. Granted, he appears to be a superhero, surviving a triple MVA rollover and a bullet to the head in the space of about a half hour. Plus, he appears invisible to police helicopters.Characters just seem to drop off. Javier Bardem was interesting. And then he disappeared. Did they cut his scenes so they could leave more of Will Smith's wife's scenes in? Bad decision. The former is a world-class actor. The latter is married to The Fresh Prince.Kudos to Jamie Foxx's agent for being able to generate enough hype to make a hit of this dungpile.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Thriller I've Seen In Years!,"Collateral was undeniably an entertaining yet intriguing project I happened to love. Tom Cruise plays Vincent with such ease, it truly is breathtaking how superb his performance was. We start our story meeting Max (Jamie Foxx) a cab driver who finds himself to be the hostage of an engaging contract killer Vincent (Tom Cruise) as he makes his rounds from hit to hit during one night in Los Angeles. It's absolutely a very interesting concept of story as I have to admit, I've never seen anything quite like this. Let's be honest I'm a massive fan of not only Tom Cruise but Jamie foxx too so it was for sure an adventure to see these two share a screen and excel in such a way.What started as a usual, boring night turned into quite the thrilling somewhat adventure for Max, definitely an experience your casual cabbie is sure to not forget so quick.

"Flawed, but rewarding.","""Collateral"" is basically a strong movie.  The action sizzles, particularly in a wild showdown scene in a dance club.  The acting among the film's two leads is top-notch, and the dialogue is thoughtful, original, and often thought-provoking.  Why then, was there just a hint of disappointment lurking in my head while watching it?One issue might be that the other Mann-directed films I've seen are near perfect, particularly ""Heat"".  Yeah, speaking of ""Heat"", ""Collateral"" has very much the same feel as that masterwork (Cops and criminals in L.A., lots or aerial shots, villains who demand the audience's respect).  Yet ""Heat"" was a film that completely blew a hole in the wall engulfing the field of cops-and-robbers crime movies.  ""Collateral"", on the other hand, feels a bit more resigned to its genre.  No matter though, as suspense/thrillers go, this is among the best.Why, you ask?  For one thing, the story is good.  While the action propels the film, the focus of the story is basically on cab driver Max (Jamie Fox) and how the traumatic experience which hit-man Vincent (Tom Cruise) puts him through impacts his character.  In addition to the good storytelling and well-drawn characters, the film is full of interesting ideas.  While I wouldn't call ""Collateral"" a philosophical film, questions posed by Vincent arouse striking issues about mankind.  How, he asks, can seeing one criminal die traumatize a person, while watching thousands of innocent people die on the news every day have no impact?  Constant provocation of this sort is thrown at Max, and even as he is abused by this man, there's no denying that his life is bettered greatly by the experience and from simply being around Vincent.  Basically, this film will appease anyone looking for a thrill and a lot of intense action.  However, for thoughtful souls who are much more turned on by ideas than actions, this film's deeper level will serve well.Which is why, I guess, the ending is such a letdown.  Throughout, this film manages to entertain while being thought-provoking, then suddenly, the climax begins and all the ideas and issues raised are given a back seat to a big finish barely distinguishable from countless other action/suspense movies.  What really gets irritating is the endless lineup of implausible occurrences thrown at the viewer in such a short time.  How a bullet can be shot straight into the side of someone's head, yet only graze his ear is a mystery I don't think I'll ever solve.  Nor will I solve the mystery of why subway chase scenes are so popular.  Anyhow, it's a shame to stick an otherwise quite good film with such a lame ending.  Honestly, going for 'big' really wasn't the way to end this movie.  Even with all the fantastic, gripping action scenes, the film's best moments are the conversations held between characters in Max's cab.  These scenes are the heart of the film. Staying true to that heart and letting the film quietly wind down would have been so much more effective. Score: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Although it begins as a classy and well organized thriller it quickly transforms into a hectic, relentless action film. Themes and symbols are abundant throughout but none more obvious than the Good (Foxx) versus Evil (Cruise).

"The ride is great, the destination a little less so.","Directed by Michael Mann with writing by Stuart Beattie, this 2004 stars Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Mark Ruffalo. It has a runtime of about 2 hours and is rated-R due it's violence and language. Made with a budget of $65 million this film became a commercial success grossed over $220 million at the box office. Since then it has gone on to gain cult success too with many of the plaudits complimenting the acting by Cruise and Foxx, and the character development being shown off.LA cab driver Max drops off one customer picks up another. During the course of the last ride he had developed a bond with the customer who turned out to be a US Justice Department prosecutor. His next customer turns out to be equally interesting; Vincent, a property developer who wants to hire him for the night for a flat fee of $600 with an additional $100 if he gets to the airport on time. Vincent claims to be in the city for one night only to close some deals and get some signatures, as soon as he's done he'll be leaving. With Max dreaming about one day having a limousine business he reluctantly takes the deal on, but at the first stop it becomes clear that Vincent isn't all he claims to be. After a body crashes out the top floor window of an apartment and hits the cabbies roof Vincent confesses to being a hit-man. With Max knowing this he is trapped into completing the fair or losing his life. Max tries his hardest to talk his way out of the dilemma, but with the FBI and LAPD on his trail it's becoming more difficult, even more so with hit-man Vincent learning all about Max's life. With the discovery of the last targets, Max feels he is forced into action to change the outcome of the night.This is an interesting and action packed film which presents some really good performances from its leads. Tom Cruise is as far away from the all-American good guy that you can get as ruthless hit-man Vincent. He is cold and callously menacing and really projects an authentic bad guy performance. Jamie Foxx goes from easy going and cool to show his characters truth of bewilderment and impotence, before going full circle and learning to stand up for himself rather than let life drift him by. Both actors characters work wonderfully together and they really share some good screen time and dialogue. They are given a script which, while it appears simple enough, is transformed due to weight of delivery given to it. The pace of the film is set fairly early on, and as soon as the ride starts it is a genuine roller-coaster - there are more calm moments where the characters are sat down and talking; and then the pace shifts up as the roller-coaster descends a summit and people are being killed on-screen. Collateral is the first feature film to use Viper FilmStream High-Definition Cameras, which have added a uniquely beautiful look to the film; it feels both cleaner and dirtier at the same time. Sound wise the film is sparce till later on the film so that dialogue shines through. Later however the score reflects the film fantastically; starting with soothing music, riding through more chaotic jazz, hitting banging club music later on, until there is louder and faster music at the climax of the film to really finish things off.I really enjoyed this film. I wasn't sure that I would but as soon as I sat down to it I was drawn in with intrigue, which quickly turned to suspense as the characters started to develop. I liked the way the film came full circle on itself with Jada Pinkett-Smith's character, while it was slightly predictable it was still a fun ride getting there and seeing how it would happen. The acting in this film is as good as any I have seen and credit must go to Cruise and Foxx for the characters they brought to life - especially Cruise who usually brings us all-American hero's but has somehow given us a cold machine of a bad guy hit-man.I have to be honest and while I have been generally complimentary about the film there are a few negatives too - there are some moments that are there for show or just for the way they sound on film. Some of the symbolism that Mann drives towards in creating his vision aren't always clear to the entire audience. Some of the things that Vincent let's happen are sloppy for a trained and seasoned hit-man, and Max's character sometimes let's himself walk into obvious set-ups. The ending of the film isn't as strong as it could be and things kind of get wrapped up quickly just to end the film; the Ruffalo getting shot; LAPD and the FBI kind of ending their pursuit; Max being able to take down a trained assassin so easily.Putting these things aside though this film is still a gritty and tense ride which is enjoyable to its audience. I am happy to recommend this film as a good way to pass a few hours; it's engaging and fun; it looks good and there score is great; and Cruise/ Foxx and in fact the rest of the cast too, give great performances.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Michael Mann's Brilliant Gritty Thriller.,"When a prominent actor such as Tom Cruise, accustomed to portraying heroes on screen, decides to try his hands at being a villain, it is always interesting to view the final result. Will the character be believably villainous? Will we be able to forget all those occasions that Ethan Hunt or John Anderton or Jerry Maguire or Maverick saved the day with his gallant efforts, and instead learn to loathe this character? Not surprisingly, a grey-haired, quick-witted Tom Cruise does incredibly well, reminding us that he is a superb actor, after all!Max (Jamie Foxx, 'Ray,' 2004) is a Los Angeles cab driver. Having maintained the same job for twelve years, Max yearns for change, but he can't accept that his dreams of starting a limousine company will never materialise. It is then that Vincent (Tom Cruise, 'Minority Report,' 2002) takes a seat in Max's cab. He instructs Max to travel to an apartment complex, and, once they arrive, to await his prompt return. Waiting patiently, Max is thoroughly shocked when a body plummets from an upper-floor window and obliterates his car windscreen.A cool and collected Vincent returns, a pistol clasped in his hand, and he commands Max to drive him around the city to each of his hits. When an aghast Max splutters, ""You killed him?"" Vincent replies with a matter-of-fact, ""No, I shot him. Bullets and the fall killed him.""Vincent is a complex and effective film character, and Cruise portrays him suitably. Foxx turns in a stellar performance for which, despite being the leading actor in the film, he received a Best Supporting Actor nomination (in any case, he won the Best Actor Oscar for 'Ray' that same year).'Collateral' was the first major motion picture to be shot with the digital Viper FilmStream Camera, and this, coupled with director Michael Mann's decision to film with a hand-held camera, gives the film a raw, gritty feel, adding a sense of realism to the plot.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wacky story pulled off by talented Mann,"The premise is like ""Phone Booth"",  a very unlikely scenario is supposed to be swallowed by the audience without it turning into a farce.  How can a movie convince an audience that a weak-kneed cab driver can become an accomplice for a hit man? Our beloved hit man, Cruise, has a ludicrous assignment of laying to waste so many people in such a way that could not happen in reality.  ""Phone Booth"" pulls it off by pulling the plug on the idea quickly before it gets lame (it clocks in at 81 minutes).Director Michael Mann, the stylistic director of ""Thief"", ""Heat"" and producer of ""Miami Vice"", is very skilled in setting up the characters with well written dialogue.  Mann's editing style includes throwing in ""garbage"" shots.  He will dwell on something insignificant, such as something you might stare at while waiting for a traffic light. Mann is underrated as a director.  He consistently gets convincing performances from talented actors.  Jamie Foxx stands out as a major star in this film by underplaying his character.  Cruise, has no choice but to play Tom Cruise.  In this case, he is a nice bad guy that kills bad bad guys.  Shot in very cold fluorescent looking light, he is convincing as a hit man.Mann plays with the HDTV format.  You would never guess this is the same format used to shoot ""Attack of the Clones"".  There is a video artefact called trailing that is reminiscent of older video technology. I'm certain that this effect was deliberately incorporated to give it a 'reality' feel.  Compared with the night video shot for the ""Cops"" TV series, or other HDTV movies with night photography, this pushed video 'look' seems to also include the look of the glare from bright lights that are in the frame.  I am still not a fan of HDTV video replacing good old 35mm film, but it makes sense in this case, when considering the overall tone of the film.  This is somewhat ironic, whereas most ""films"" shot on video want to try their best to avoid the 'video' look.During this two hour movie, the cabbie named Max is forced to examine his life while he is being confronted with the life or death situation involving Cruise. Here is where the true core of the movie resides.  The screenwriter(s) adroitly avoid the machinations of a plot that looks contrived on paper, and instead concentrate on the three central characters (the third being Annie, the pretty prosecuting attorney).   Once we get inside the head of Foxx's character, we can believe the series of events (but barely at points) that drive this film. It is rare that a film delivers on both story and action.  The action scenes are quick and violent,  and keep the adrenaline pumping.While this film will not change the minds of anyone about Tom Cruise, nevertheless he performs well when in the experienced hands of renowned directors (Scorcese. Levinson, Spielberg, Stone, Kubrick, Pollack).   The audience can be assured also that you won't readily be able to predict how the night will end, which keeps you involved in the third act.  I would not be surprised if the film is remembered at Oscar time, including acting by Foxx, and director Mann.I give it a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Plot is predictable,"I have to admit up front that I am no fan of Tom Cruise's acting. Much to my surprise, the acting in this film is its strength. Nice cameo by Javier Bardem, but his presence if pretty much wasted. The problem is the heavy handed directing and typical Hollywood boorish script. A reasonable person can pretty much predict the outcome within the first half hour of the film. The ending left me less than satisfied and laughing at the lack of ingenuity.

'Collateral' is a professionally made and competent thriller.,"****************""I can't drive you around while you're killing folks. It ain't my job!"" ""Tonight it is.""****************'Collateral' is a professionally made and competent thriller. Unfortunately, despite crisp direction from Michael Mann and good performances from both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, the film rarely rises above that level. That the film achieves every one of its goals is not much of a compliment because its goals were set rather low. 'Collateral' wants to provide two hours of low-boil tension with occasional outbursts of excitement as we follow a cold-hearted contract assassin (Cruise) and his unwilling chauffeur-for-the-night cab driver (Foxx). It accomplishes that competently.What is slightly depressing is that the film starts off with some really great character development and has us truly getting involved with the two main leads, but then dwindles into a routine cat and mouse chase that can be seen in any one of a dozen other films each year. It almost feels like the ideas just ran dry half way through writing the screenplay.However, there are many things to like here. Mann is tremendously confident with his camera work. His angles and shot selections will never allow you to look at your wristwatch in boredom. He gives this film a memorable look.I really liked the initial scene with Jamie Foxx driving Jada Pinkett-Smith's attorney character to her office. It takes a while for us to fully realize the significance of that cab ride, but it is a fascinating conversation that is well executed.I also enjoyed both Cruise and Foxx. Their interaction early in the crazy Los Angeles night, as Vincent (Cruise) adapts Max (Foxx) into his deadly plans, was intriguing to say the least. Cruise's performance was typically brilliant, but Foxx surprised me. He really has some acting chops on him. I look forward to seeing more from him in the future.I also appreciated the use of location. Los Angeles is such a vast city... spread out and disjointed. It is rare that a film captures the character of that city the way so many have with NYC. Mann uses the city very well.I suppose the film can easily be considered 'good'... perhaps I would not argue too much with 'very good'. But it stumbles short of greatness because it doesn't set its sights very high. I don't think it qualifies as anything more than mere entertainment or two hours of thrills and I don't think too many in the audience will remember much about it a few months from now.'Collateral' is a solid thriller with a clever premise, a visually inventive look, and a couple of intense performances. It succeeds in what it attempts to do... I just wanted it to do more. I wanted to feel something more... for the situation, the ideas or the characters. Instead, as I squinted my way into the parking-lot, all I was wondering was where I had parked.*********************""You just met him once and you killed him like that?"" ""What...

Good film betrayed by weak ending,"Casting Tom Cruise against type isn't the only thing Collateral has going for it, but it's probably the best thing about the movie. Cruise, whom we have known over the last two decades for playing heroes of varied stripes, finally turns in his do-gooder's suit for something of a little darker stripe.Collateral itself is a seedier film than one usually sees Cruise in, steeped in the world of criminal shadiness, drug runners, hired assassins, and the like. It's a place where Cruise should seem ill-at-ease, but his Vincent not only works organically, he's compelling enough that we want to root for him  and he is not the good guy, not by a long shot.Jamie Foxx co-stars as a cabdriver named Max who very simply gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, and tries to make the best of his bad situation. While Foxx is also not the first person you would think of for a role of this sort, he inhabits Max's skin very comfortably as well; most of the film is he and Cruise playing off one another, and they do this very well.Director Mann gives us just enough of a story to get by, and that's all you really need. Details would be meaningless in a plot like this, and so exposition is left to the wayside and largely substituted with character development; this pays off through most of the film, and as Max and Vincent get to know one another better, the dramatic ante is upped. A scene where they visit Max's mother in the hospital is particularly well-done, as is one where Max has to pretend he's Vincent in front of a crimelord. The film moves along at a brisk and engaging pace until the ending; there's a horrible plot contrivance, and it deflates the proceedings somewhat. The movie is strong up until that point, but the ending simply asks for too much suspension of disbelief, and ends up betraying the rest of the film.But both Cruise and Foxx turn in strong performances, and the movie's worth going to see if for no other reason than to watch these two fence with one another (they reportedly got along famously on set; I think some of that camaraderie seeps into the picture, despite the fact that the two are adversaries). But Collateral is fairly solid up until the end, and showcases two pretty strong performances. Given the high caliber of other thrillers this summer, Collateral might not be able to hold its own due mostly to its weak ending; but if you have a second run theater near you, it's definitely worth checking out there.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"really moved me, I cry at the end every time","There's something about this movie. The script is great. I love that its shot at night. I don't necessarily think Tom Cruise is a great actor, hes a good actor, but I've never seen a movie of his that I haven't enjoyed. He has a talent of picking movies and scripts that are excellent, with the exception of Top Gun and that car film ;).My only criticism is I doubt very much an assassin would wear a light grey suit and sunglasses at night, particularly inside a hospital. It certainly isn't subtle, but I overlooked that because the movie carries you along. It is a very cruisy and emotive movie. Really didn't enjoy Mark Rufalo's character. Just didn't fit in and didn't seem necessary.I loved that there weren't car chases and things blowing up which is the usual Hollywood cover-up for no plot and bad scripts, and it had a psychological undercurrent.I loved the coyote part of the movie. The look in their eyes, the displacement of the coyote and displacement of those two characters in their own city etc. Its nice to see a movie where everything isn't spelled out. I loved the line, about the train and the body on the train, and ""do you think anyone will notice""The humanity of the film is very poignant. Tom Cruise' character as the assassin had many aspects. He was a sad intelligent and lost character and the end always makes me cry.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best movie of the summer!,"Michael Mann is a master of realism. Movies don't get much better than this. Collateral is a movie that has a little something for everyone. It has extremely entertaining action for the action fan, it has subtle humor for the Jamie Foxx fans, it has hard drama for those fans who like to believe what they are seeing could actually happen, but the best feature of this movie had to be its suspense. Mann had me on the edge of my seat from the opening scene of the film to the very end. Tom Cruise of course handed in another impeccable performance. It was actually quite refreshing to see him as the anti-hero. However, being a big TC fan, I continually found myself cheering for him. Tom makes you believe that the character Vincent is real. Mark Ruffalo gave in a star-turning performance as the lead detective hunting down Foxx and Cruise. This is the kind of role that will turn him into a strong supporting star for many years to come. Ruffalo also made you believe that his character Detective Raymond Fanning was a real person and Ruffalo made him very easy to relate to. Michael Mann of course made all of this happen through his masterful camera-work and location filming. Mann is a master of on site filming and makes you feel as though you are in the cab with Cruise and Foxx during a normal LA nite. Mann's past experiences with Manhunter and Heat are relevant in this film and made it more enjoyable to watch. Last but not least is Jamie Foxx. Jamie played the unbelievably real cab driver Max Durocher. 3/4 of the way through, Foxx stole this movie. His character had an epiphany and I soon found myself cheering for his character of Max. This is the kind of role that will put Foxx in the position of starring roles for many years to come. Mann was also able to amp up the feel of this movie with an unbelievable soundtrack, featuring a bone chilling hit from Audioslave, Shadow on the Sun. The audio in this movie is second to none and the soundtrack is a great investment. Mann's signature camera-work was a joy to watch; which is probably why I already went to see it three times. His scene with the coyotes was the best scene in movies all summer. It gave me goosebumps and let me know that something big was about to happen. It's not often that a director can evoke such emotion from such an intelligent viewer. Overall, this was probably the best movie of the summer. Mann did nothing wrong. His mix of characters and actors portraying them perfectly,his haunting soundtrack, stunning visuals, masterful camera-work and real-life dialog make this movie one which will imitated and looked up to for decades to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overrated thriller,"Michael Mann's COLLATERAL is firmly anchored by Tom Cruise and Jaime Foxx and it's nicely photographed, but it's also contrived and predictable and moves at a snail's pace,The climax, in which several characters happen to find themselves in the same place, a building, at a most convenient time, doesn't wash with me.Mann serves up a couple of polished suspense sequences, but his much-talked-about shootout scene in a nightclub is a total fizzer. It's all set-up and no delivery and the scene itself has little connection with the central plot.Watching this flick a little voice in my head kept saying ""we've seen it all before"". I have. I've seen dozens of films about criminals in Los Angeles.Mann's HEAT is still his penultimate work and is a wonderful film because it bothers to look at why its characters do what they do.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""Take comfort in knowing you never had a choice...""","Collateral...a movie that I have very mixed feelings about.It involves a taxi driver (Max) (supposedly a side job) that meets a strange man (Vincent) that enters his taxi and asks him to drive to a certain place, he does, and the man turns out to be a contract killer who holds Max hostage and tells him to drive around for Vincent's kills. Definitely an interesting plot, and a good plot. Definitely not a bad point of this movie (oh and also, Max meets a woman in the beginning of the movie that serves importance later in the movie).The acting is also not a bad point in the movie. Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise work great together. Tom Cruise acts phenomenally. Jamie Foxx does as well. The secondary characters are also very well played.The cinematography is also something great about the movie. I absolutely love the camera. It makes the movie feel much more personal and interesting. The soundtrack is good. The audio is reasonable. But the visuals are just phenomenal, honestly, it is some of the best visuals I have ever seen in a movie. The cinematography gets a 10/10 from me for the camera work alone.Now, the realism is a big problem with this movie, so many scenes just make no sense at all. The consistency in this movie just does not exist. (Don't even get me started on that jazz scene.) Some things are just nonsensical while other parts make a lot if sense. I wish it could be more realistic because this movie could be a lot better if it were.For the entertainment, equally as inconsistent. The movie goes from pretty good, to mediocre, back to good then to bad and the end is pretty great. Some scenes are just awful and confusing (like the club scene), and then other scenes are really well done. Which is why this leaves me confused for what to think of this movie. The whole movie I was thinking to myself: This is pretty good or This is not very good. But there are definitely some thrilling parts that leave you excited to see what happens next.For the emotional impact, I can't say it scores very high in that either, but there was no intent of anything emotional. So, I have no opinion on that.As for the characters, they are well written and there is significant character development especially in Max's character who goes from the social kind taxi driver to the bad ass during the movie. I find the characters great.And the ending is phenomenal, the one-liner from Vincent in the end is great, I couldn't put it as the review title though, it would be a spoiler. Jada Pinkett Smith really does great in this film. And the ending was well written and unexpected.In conclusion:

Mann Does It Again,"While Heat was Michael Mann's grand crime-drama masterpiece, Collateral is his attempt at an equally compelling but more concise, fast paced thriller. Accentuating that tight structure is the fact that the film takes place over one night; I'll go so far as to say it's the best film of the 'One Night' subgenre. Another taxonomy this film ranks near the top of is Tom Cruise's filmography. It's one of the few, perhaps only, performances of his as a villain and I challenge anyone to name a better one from him. Also when you praise Cruise in this film, I think that goes with including Jamie Foxx who's well cast and the way they play off of each other raises both actors.With authenticity, humor, succinct but impactful action and a story that just keeps moving, Collateral is one of the best of its type of films and an achievement all around.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Tinged, Riveting, Cruise, transcends from boy actor to 'Mann'.","I didn't rate this a ten, but that doesn't mean that I felt that this was inadequate. Michael Mann has an uncanny ability to show and tell a story, whether in speech or a quiet very composed shot, he most definitely has a gift at bringing out the interesting in his set-up style.His craft is completed it seems once he has taken you to the edge of the tale, sometimes over it...and sometimes back. Tom Cruise, has his ability, wrapped up in his own form, in other words Tom always seems to be Tom. No matter if he has a different accent or speaks plainly, Cruise is who he is.The 'Gifted' part that I see Mann perform again and again is, his ability to change and actor's regular style. He usually directs them into the character he is written them for. For example take the alleyway, where the two young street boys are looking for an easy target as they rob, Max (The cab driver) and take Vincent's briefcase too. Vincent confronts them in deafening action when threatened by them. It is a flash of deadly force! It jars your mind. Fast and final. Even down to the way the cops communicate with each other and the Feds, it looks and feels real, it's authentic.. Nothing short of amazing. I loved Bruce McGill's Federal agent character, calm collected and in-charge. Lending a good slice of style to Collateral.Though, I disagree with the ending and the office scene, from the street where you could see into the building and propel the movie's storyline on further by sight, is immaterial. I do however, think that by not seeing where Vincent was during that time at the office of the attorney, it would have brought a different element of chaos and a better serving of panicked anxiety. Sometimes the most powerful suspense you can give is by having loose ends, not seeing whats there until you're right in front of it. But, the way it was shot and the expanded audio feel that Mann gives us with the 'film-grain' is a delicious exercise for the senses.The feeling of paddling along in murky deep water, trying to quickly escape an impending disaster is what I felt in this visually pleasing story of cat and mouse. Tom, for a couple hours, with Michael's help was in fact Vincent, the killer. Wow, Mann loves to do the turn-around, and seems to always do it victoriously. Bravo Mr.Mann you did it again.I love the way, this hits you when you are watching it intently, with nothing else happening on a superior audio visual system.(***)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Michael Mann does it again.,"Despite some flaws, especially in the story, ""Collateral"" is a thrilling and suspenseful movie with a great style and atmosphere.Perhaps most surprising thing about the movie is Tom Cruise. He is great as a bad guy and almost unrecognizable. Tom Cruise is one of those actors that you'll always recognize in a movie as being just Tom Cruise. At times throughout this movie I forgot I was watching Tom Cruise, I was watching Vincent! Jamie Foxx was also great, I was enthusiastic about this young actor ever since ""Any Given Sunday"" came out in 1999. I'm sure he'll win his well deserved Oscar some day. Perhaps this year? He is being nominated for both his role in this movie and for his leading role in ""Ray"". Looks like 2005 will be Jamie Foxx's year.The character development in the movie is great. We slowly get to know the 2 main characters and see Foxx his character slowly transform.Leave it to Michael Mann to keep this movie interesting to watch the whole time, even the scene's in which nothing happens. The movie is more a thriller than an action movie but when the few action sequences come, it truly jumps of the screen. The movie also features some of the most realistic executions since the ""Godfather"" movies.If you can look past the flaws of the story, you'll find ""Collateral"" a true treat.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Hit men Movie Ever,"If you are into action and like ""Hit man"" type of movies, then this is the best movie for you. Tom Cruise as the assassin--more likely a hit men is the best character that can play this movie. The beginning of the movie is classic, Jamie Foxx playing as the Taxi Driver and then little romantic time, I don't want to reveal the whole movie. Anyway this is my first time watching Tom Cruise into action, murdering people-looks like a real serial killer. I was flabbergasted by his act; I have to say he is the Best Hit men ever. The scheme of the movie was well written and displayed. From beginning of the movie to end you will have your eye wedged to the screen. Jamie Foxx(Max)the little helper of Tom Cruise(Vincent), as like the old school, Man helps Man. In the end the movie have very good twist, when Max discover that Vincent is after his Girl, so he tries to save her. The ending was very sad for me. Fascinating act by both of them, I give them high extol. By the act of the Hit men, you really can't tell that Tom Cruise can be a killer. You can't judge a person, until you become familiar with them. But, role of Jamie Foxx was also exquisite as he turn himself as a shooter to save somebody's life and then kills the villain. It's also good to see that Hollywood didn't portray Jamie Foxx as the bad man. Mostly you see Blackman always the criminal. My opinion - that he can't play the role of Vincent as Tom Cruise did anyway -- Tom cruises is the best. I wish I was playing Vincent as the Hit men, but Tom Cruise showed the best fighting and gun action that you would expect.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A dark, penetrating film","Collateral has its share of flaws. The beginning is too choreographed, there are several superfluous characters that the camera spends excessive time with (cops), and finally, the plot has some annoyingly predictable elements.This is, however, a magnificent film.Tom Cruise is a stylish but experienced hit-man who clearly spends his off days listening to improvised jazz, sipping scotch, and reading Nietzsche. He's a calculating man of will, suffering from a rather pronounced case of anti-social disorder. What he's not, is a caricature.Jamie Fox is a cab driver, and for the purposes of this film, Cruise's foil. He is an ordinary person with ambitions, but insufficient will to realize them. His fanatical capacity to predict trip times and devotion to efficiency suggest a stagnant, almost autistic approach to life.These are terrific characters to start with, but where the film really excels is in its treatment of them. Despite immense odds, it manages to maintain a Hemingway'esque level of objectivity in a more pronounced fashion than 'Heat'. In so doing, it keeps us interested not only in who will ultimately 'win', or how stylishly he does so, but also (and more importantly) in how the characters exist in each moment.9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Gem with Cruise as the Heavy,"This screenplay was an obvious winner with many great directors and actors considered for the film.

The pace and tension build to a dramatic end with a very satisfying final camera shot.The film is dark, philosophical, and believable.

A stylish and well scripted thriller by Michael Mann,"Along with seeing Garden State last night and going on a streak of seeing good films, I watched Collateral. All I can say for this movie is that it was simply great. The acting by Jamie Foxx and especially Tom Cruise was magnificent. I thought Jamie Foxx was good and I guess you can call him up for an academy award but Tom Cruise gave one of his best performances. Usually his acting is a little cheesy, but in Collateral, he just put up a great role as a bad ass hit-man and he was a ""bad ass."" The script was definitely a plus too and had great dialouge added to it. The movie is just very stylish and is tied on being the best thriller with Phone Booth.

Mann is the man!,"This was quite the surprise. A super tight film noir coming out of LA for once is not daily (or yearly) routine. I watched 'Heat' while a mere teenager and liked it, but I also liked 'The Rock' and 'Broken Arrow' so I didn't expect that Michael Mann was such a master director. He takes Tom Cruise and a comedy actor, put them in a taxi in L.A. and it turns out as 'Collateral', the best thriller/noir I have seen in a long time. Jamie Foxx is very good as the taxi driver, but Tom Cruise excels as the hit-man. I have never seen him as good as this, he could even take the almighty guv'nors job in 'Terminator' with success with this killers determination.Pictures are very beautiful also even if L.A. is not.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Solid film.,"This is Michael Mann's best recent movie. He can still do something that just draws you in and holds your attention throughout. That is what ""Collateral"" does. The movie shoots off the moment Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx link up.As for the principals, Foxx is the one who does best. One wonders why this performance wasn't also nominated for an Oscar. His cab driver, Max's shift from submissiveness to heroism is completely believable. He is every bit the frightened victim of circumstance and the defiant everyman put together.Tom Cruise, although a little bit less convincing, fills the role effectively. His total and utter lack of remorse and human empathy turns Vincent into a monster that the audience only fears and roots against. Except for his incongruous gray hair contrasted with his still fairly-boyish looks, Cruise's work here is totally on the mark.As good as this movie is, ""Heat"" (1995) is even better- and more realistic. That's a movie in which the police are just as smart as the bad guys, and professional criminals are defeated by law enforcement, not by a guy on the street.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dazzling and Stunning Thriller!,"This is one of the best thrillers I have seen this decade. I found it impossible to pause the film to get a drink every once in awhile. This movie was even nominated for two Academy Awards. I could've gotten more.This film is about a assassin named Vincent who has been assigned to kill five people due to legal troubles. Vincent hires a taxi driver with a big dream to take him around to these killing stops. That changes Max's life dramatically.The acting is very good. Tom Cruise is back but this time as the bad guy. Jamie Foxx is a superb job as the babbling taxi driver.There are many plot twists in the film. When I expected something to happen, it seems like the opposite always happens. I give kudos to the screenwriters.Michael Mann did a great job. It's ironic that the movie I saw before this one was his 1992's Last of the Mohicans.Overall, this is a great thriller that stands out. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Possibly  the best movie of 2004,"I HATE Tom Cruise, I cannot stand him...at all. I believe that Jamie Foxx is good, but overrated. And Michael Mann? Ehhhh, hes decent, but by no means good. However, in this movie, they all make it work. This movie is fantastic. Mark Ruffalo (along with the rest of the cast) is very believable. The more I watch this movie, the more I love it. The first time I watched, I liked it. The second time, I really liked it. The third time, I was in a hotel room and it came on HBO, so I watched, and I could not believe that I did not own this movie. The very next day, I went and bought it. This movie belongs in everyones collection. Jamie Foxx is better in this role than he was in Ray, which I did not particularly care for. And Tom Cruise is Awesome! Please, go and BUY Collateral!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Say cheese,"After seeing the high average rating of viewers of IMDb, and the promising idea for an original action movie, I watched this in theatre tonight.After the first killing in the movie (with the guy dropping on the cab), I already got a bad feeling. After some more dialogues it got worse. Yep, another wannabe 'intelligent' action movie, with a few jokes throw in, because we don't want it to be too excited.Really cheesy 'psychological' dialogues, and some really horrible unnatural flow of the story (the taxi driver seeing the same girl he talked to earlier is on the list (chance of that is like 1 out of 867, 545,124. The guy chasing Tom Cruise himself, why inform the police right? etc. etc.)I can really enjoy an action movie, but this one really tries way too hard, but it worked for most people i guess?4 out of 10",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
"a thriller about choices in life, a masterpiece","Collateral maybe is one of the best tom cruise movies ever made, that not everybody has watched.In many ways, the tale about vicent and max sharing the same taxi during a whole night is more about choices and why sometimes we dont try to do something, even if we can...
is a real masterpiece, the acting, the photography,the music, the editing...you really feel like you are inside the taxi with them, because the style, the camera angles, the music choices... I can watch this movie a million times, and always feel more deeper with time.How vicent is the daring and unstroppable, and max being cautions and daydreamer...the movie ask the question, will do u something to try to achieve your dreams? Well, part of why i enjoy reviewing movies and uploading movie cars, is because i feel like is what makes me feel fine...but this movie ask for everybody, why dont you follow your dreams? In fact i think this movie is a good reminder, like, if u forgot what makes you feel alive, this movie give you alot of questions to ask yourself...are you enjoying what are you doing right now?Is tom cruise most underrated movie, because not everybody have watched this, and jamie foxx as the cab driver is the calm guy who see everything different...after one night.This movie is the best metaphor that sometimes we dont even find sure about what we are doing, or we have doubts...and the answer is always in ourselves.Everybody should watch at last once this movie, because is more about what we chosse and how many times we dont see what is in front of us...i think everybody can relate.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very stylish,"Tense, humorous, violent and enjoyable. Interesting circle for Cruise to go from passionate love in a subway car in Risky Business to passionless hate in an another subway car scene. Seems long at times -- waiting for some sort of climax, which because of foreshadowing you'll know will get there, but when. Los Angeles looks great. Getting tired of car crashes where people just walk away (Bourne Supremacy as another example). Cruise did an adequate job of relaying emotions and shift in character through his eyes. Foxx was controlled for most of the film and did an excellent job of creating a plausible character in an borderline plausible circumstance,",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
rubbish,"First off, I can't remember liking any Michael Mann movie, so bear that in mind when reading this review. Collateral is terrible. The dialogue, set up, plot and execution are all overblown and over-stylised. Tom Cruise's hair is the most absurd thing on view though, although given the video game chic this film seems to be aiming for it is at least just as pixel perfect as everything else on offer. Some director's coach great performances from their actors; Mann bludgeons forced performances from his and always has, the twitches and gurnings on show evidence of the marionette strings he wields. If you enjoy cliché writ large and in a flourishy font, you may enjoy this brainless play.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are excellent in this top notch thriller.,"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are both cast against type in Michael Mann's thriller Collateral. Both are excellent in this top notch thriller that had me engaged from beginning to end. Michael Mann who is best known for the crime caper Heat (1995) can add another excellent movie to his filmography with Collateral as one of his best movies.Max (Jamie Foxx) is a taxi driver who is meticulous in his routine and knows his way through the streets of Los Angeles like the back of his hand. He's seen it all as he's been doing it for 12 years. Max also has big dreams of having his own limousine company which has not eventuated. Amongst his passengers include US Department of Justice prosecutor Annie Farrell (Jada Pinkett Smith) who has taking a liking to Max. Soon after a mysterious man dressed in a grey suit named Vincent (Tom Cruise) enters Max's taxi and offers Max $600 to drive him around Los Angeles for the entire night making various stops along the way. The first fare turns out to be anything but routine when a man riddled with bullets falls out of an apartment window and onto Max's taxi. Vincent later reveals himself to be a hit-man and takes Max hostage, ordering him to drive him to various stops to complete his task. Not only must Max work to save himself, he must also try to save the remaining targets. Hot on the path and trying to make the connection between the victims is LAPD Detective Ray Fanning (Mark Ruffalo).Everyone is used to seeing Tom Cruise as the good guy but without a doubt this is one of his best performances as the cold and sleek hit-man Vincent. It was a shame Tom Cruise did not receive any awards for his performance because this was one of his most memorable roles. Jamie Foxx who frequently plays loud and charismatic characters also goes against type as the mild mannered and diligent taxi driver Max. Jamie Foxx was a well deserved nominee for an Academy Award for his role as Max. Rounding out the supporting cast includes Mark Ruffalo, Jada Pinkett Smith, Peter Berg, Bruce McGill, Barry Shabaka Henley, Javier Bardem and in a brief cameo Jason Statham.Director Michael Mann brings to life a neo noir thriller with his trademark visuals and a tightly wound story that does not have a single dull moment. Everything about it is vintage Michael Mann. Australian writer Stuart Beattie brings to his life his excellent work which originally started as an idea which popped into his head as a 17 year old catching a taxi from Sydney Airport to his home. I bet he's glad he put that idea on paper and seeing it brought to life on screen.Collateral is a top notch thriller. Not only is it engaging from start to finish, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are both memorable in their respective roles which keeps the film moving at a cracking pace. Collateral truly deserved its critical acclaim.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Quite the suspenseful thriller, Tom Cruise pulls off his part eerily well and Jamie Foxx portrays a quiet hero excellently.","Having seen this film many years ago when it came out, a recent re-watching of the Blu-ray at home with my wife has cemented itself as a tight and well-done film. While most action films like to confuse the audience with shaky cameras and quick cuts, this one starts calm and builds to an exciting conclusion.Of course, it's not just a steady and methodical thriller, it loops back on itself, tying up all loose ends and bookending the whole plot in a neat little package. Each of the segments where they drive to the next destination gives a chance for excellent character building as well as giving the audience a break from the brief moments of action (which steadily get longer and more intense as the film progresses). Along with the overhead tracking shots and expert use of depth of field, this film almost borders on art. These are what good action films should be.What's also interesting, upon a second viewing almost 14 years later, is how many recognizable actors are in this film. Some of them are bit parts, and they don't quite look like their more famous character portrayals, but inevitably you'll go, ""Isn't that so-and-so?"" From Jason Statham at the beginning, Jada Pinkett Smith on either end, Mark Ruffalo with some ""ethnic-looking"" facial hair, and Javier Bardem years before No Country for Old Men (2007). Most of these actors had not hit their stride quite yet, but Jamie Foxx definitely gave a great portrayal of a character who undergoes plenty of superb character development (which is partly why he was nominated for this film, along with Ray (2004) in the same year).Quite the suspenseful thriller, Tom Cruise pulls off his part eerily well and Jamie Foxx portrays a quiet hero excellently. I give Collateral 4.5 stars out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
COLLATERAL is a real movie for real adult.,"I saw the movie at home a night ten days before, and I like it.Vincent and Max are two types people, Vincent is extra positive, like a typical American, his point of view is to spend limited money to start the business soon, just like his suggestion to Max, but Max would prepare everything in good condition, and then to start his own business.What if one day, you wake up, and find nothing come but you are old, only have daydream, this seemed to asked to me by myself, to quit boss and start my own business to fulfil my own dream, this need courage, Vincent has it, but Max don't, to call the girl I like, also need courage.Mostly, I'm the type of Max, an ordinary man to go to work every week day to make a living, Vincent is also for a living, do as his will, maybe Vincent and Max should learn from each other.This Movie gives resonance to me, maybe gives resonance to most people like me, it's a movie for adult, and make me thinking about my own future, it's much better than those entertaining movies, which are interesting, funny, shocking...but...empty...After seeing the movie, and bought another DVD-9 copy, and will see it again, next time, we will see the caption in English, try to find something more in it.From this movie, when I buying DVD, I ignored many ""interesting"" movies.In addition, when I seeing the movie, I forget Vincent is Tom, I think this is the best movie Tom played. Fox's acting is very natural and unexaggerate, this is the first time I saw his playing.I hope to have a CD of the songs in the movie, and I agree that the ""wolf"" in the movie give resonance to Vincent, and also to me.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Odd Roles for Both,"This film definitely takes a bit of a turn from previous roles for both Jamie Fox and Tom Cruise. Cruise plays a hit man who uses a cabbie's services to complete a list of marks for the evening. The cabbie, played by Fox, is a well-educated man who almost comes across as not fitting the part correctly. I'm not trying to slant cab drivers, but Fox didn't seem convincing, maybe because of his comedic background. Cruise wasn't much better. For a guy that usually plays the hero's role, seeing him act darkly was a first. I will say that his new image (grayish hair, unshaven look) helped him at least look the part. The polished wit and outfit gave him a distinguished presence. But then his philosophy on life, psychology, etc. threw him out of the stereotypical hit-man mix. In the end, I guess they both were so oddly paired for their roles that the director thought the movie could work. But really, how plausible is any film where a contract killer uses a taxi-cab driver as his personal chauffeur for killing people?! The outrageousness of that alone is almost too much, albeit sensationalism is one of the things viewers can't seem to resist. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Simply amazing,"For a ""hit-man"" movie I give this film a 10 out of 10, no doubt! Tom Cruise plays a great bad guy in whom is cool, so you tend to like him just as much as you hate him. The quick fight scenes are intense and highly entertaining. Of course ""hit-man"" movies don't have in-depth plots like a Gladiator epic, but one must know that when watching the movie. So you can't compare it to that. The problem with some of the reviews on people who didn't like the movie, usually makes comments on how it was to quick or the storyline wasn't really deep. Hmmm, considering its a hit-man movie, yes it would be rather quick, and considering its not some Lord of the Rings trilogy, I suppose the person is right, it isn't that ""in-depth"". Go into a movie expecting something good ""WITHIN ITS GENRE"". I mean, how can you compare Robin Hood Men in Tights with The Return of the King? Standing in its genre, I believe it is the best of the best! Tom Cruise rocks!! Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Los Angeles After Dark,"Director Michael Mann teams up with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx to make his latest stylish thriller, the first film of his that I've seen in theatres. The heart of this film is Jamie Foxx, displaying acting skills far in excess of what I would have credited him with; I'm now even more interested to see his portrayal of Ray Charles.  Tom Cruise is also playing against type, as a nihilistic assassin.  Cruise is also good, although the role offers him little to do other than act like a villainous badass.  Jada Pinkett Smith, Peter Berg, Bruce McGill, and an unrecognizable Mark Ruffalo are all fine in supporting roles.  The movie is clearly Foxx's, however, as the audience identifies primarily with his terrified taxi driver. Mann's direction of Collateral is excellent, shooting with digital film that allows Los Angeles to look like it never has before.  Bravo, Mr. Mann.  And Mr. Cruise.  And Mr. Foxx.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Intelligent drama and Cruise's best film,"Having seen this film about 6 times and holding it in my top 10 films of all time, I was so surprised to learn that not many people have seen this film. Most people love 'Heat' whereas 'Collateral', a film with the same director in the same style, went by rather unnoticed. So I'm just going to say watch this film as it has something there for most film lovers.You shouldn't go into it with too many details, just that Tom Cruise breaks his usual role and plays a cold, calculating killer named Vincent who happens to step into a cab of a pathetic yet optimistic, kind hearted driver named Max (Jamie Foxx). The film shows the events of one night as our two completely opposite characters are thrown together by chance. I won't say more for fear of spoilers but the story is fantastic right up until the ending which did become a little predictable though it was carried out very well.For those that like slow moving character dramas, this film has plenty of that with some of the best acting I've ever seen. Tom Cruise is a great actor but he is excellent in his role as Vincent, playing such a cool character and really making me feel like that is who he actually is. He should do similar roles more often rather than always playing the hero. Jamie Foxx shows some of the best character development in film and his role here put him on the map for me.For those who love action films there is certainly some very well directed action from the man who brought us that spectacular heist scene in 'Heat'. It isn't on such a huge scale as 'Heat' but it isn't meant to be either. This is a slow moving character film but the action sequences will not disappoint action fans, most notably the chaotic club scene which was carried out so well.I'll say again that this film is so good that I am so disappointed that so few people have actually seen it. If you're a fan of 'Heat', or suspense films, or character driven dramas then see this film and I hope you enjoy every moment of it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
This film left me with minor Stockholm Syndrome,"A fantastic entry into the crime/thriller sub-genre and a damn good film starring Jamie Foxx as a taxi driver for a murder-by-numbers sociopath played by Tom Cruise.Despite Tom Cruise's role as an assassin, he still comes off as a charming (sociopath) and a kind-hearted (if existential or even nihilistic) individual who's just trying to get his job done.He plays the ""bad guy"" though describes himself as ""indifferent,"" and yet his relationship with the main character (Jamie Foxx) shows compassion and even respect, which is far from indifference.Collateral is a great film, it asks a lot of questions and so it leaves the viewer asking those same questions as well.Are you going to see over-the-top choreographed action like in Mission: Impossible? No. But what you will see is a genuinely enjoyable thriller that will constantly have you guessing, wondering, asking questions, and REALLY wishing Tom Cruise didn't have to be the bad guy all the way through to the end.I highly recommend this film to both people who are and are not fans of Tom Cruise, and it's a great film both for ""veterans"" of the Thriller genre and for newcomers alike",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overrated,"This is a long, drawn out film. It has several directional flaws and although Michael Mann is a Hollywood favorite, I thought his directing here was uninspired. Tom Cruise tries to be the tough guy hit man and wears a thick gray hair piece to try to make his part more believable - it doesn't work. All I saw was Tom Cruise attempting to be a badass with supposed kung fu and superior gun firing moves - the Bourne Supremacy does the super strong man much better. The only highlight is Jamie Foxx as the 'hero' - a cabdriver with big dreams. The director makes sure he is carefully characterized and developed - too much so for my taste. Everything is so spelled out and attempts at being 'artistic' fail for me. I do NOT recommend this movie, although most of the guys I have talked to loved it. So maybe that is more of what it is - a masculine movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stylish and serious,"This is a Michael Mann movie, and I must say it is in the same league as his others. It tells the story of Max (Jamie Foxx), a depressed cab driver with dreams of running a limo business. One night he picks up and unusual customer, Vincent (Tom Cruise). Vincent asks Max to stick with him through the night as he has multiple stops to make, he even offers him a substantial sum of money in return for Max's efforts.What Max doesn't know is that these aren't just ordinary stops. Max is soon wishing he hadn't picked Vincent up as things turn tricky.The film is shot in a similar style to ""Heat""; Lots of nice suits, clever use of lighting, no-nonsense action scenes and well developed character inter-action. Particularly between the cool calculating Vincent and the nervous Max. Camera-work is used to brilliant effect as well, it ranges from high up shots of the brightly lit city to close up facial shots, all accompanied to appropriate music.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
